I got a hold of a Poloroid OneStep Sonar camera at the second hand =
store,  but it does not seem to match any of the pinouts I've seen on =
the Web...

I've aready seen the pinout at WIRZ, but it is not the same.   this =
board has 16 pins all at the edge of the board.   Mark Robillard shows =
this very board in his "Microprocessor Controlled Robotics" book,  but =
he does not show the pinout.

Has anyone had experience with this board?  can you provide a =
schematic/pinout?

Also..  Does anyone know how to get a hold of Mark Robillard?=20

Wayne
