Subject: dc motor output control

hi everyone,

i need some help on controling the output voltage of the dc motor ports. the
output voltage is 9.6V and i like to know if there is any way to clamp down
the voltage to 5V or lesser. i try using a enternal resistor but the output
signal is very unstable. sometimes when i am controling only motor port 0,
the other motor port's LED will light up too. please help

Thanks

Michael
