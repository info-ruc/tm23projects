Greetings everyone,

It's the last day of 1998, so it's a good time to announce the
official release of the Handy Board expansion board.  The Handy Board
Expansion Board is officially released!

The Expansion Board plugs on top of the Handy Board, and provides the
following features:

*	10 additional analog sensor inputs.

*	4 inputs for active LEGO sensors (reflectance sensor and shaft
encoder).

*	9 digital outputs.

*	6 servo motor control signals.  Power may be supplied from the Handy
Board's internal battery or an external source.

*	connector mount for Polaroid 6500 ultrasonic ranging system.

*	general-purpose electrical prototyping area.

*	pass-through connector for the Handy Board's LCD screen. 

A lot of people have contributed to design through their suggestions
and feedback.  I'm sorry it's taken so long, but, better late than
never.

Three vendors have already lined up to sell Expansion Board blank
PCBs, parts kits, and assembled boards.  Kits are in stock now;
assembled boards will be available mid-January.

All information is available at

Thanks everyone for your encouragement in getting this design done.

Yours,
Fred
