You don't really show your connection to your Handyboard, but I would
suspect that with 16 connectted in parallel, you are probably drawing
sufficient current to drop your voltage below the reset value of the
micro monitor (DS1233? if I remember corretly).
Perhaps try testing the voltage with all in place, and making sure it is
above about 4.5v.
