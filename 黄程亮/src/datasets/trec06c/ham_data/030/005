Hi!

Could someone please tell me what is the Handyboard a/d range (60 mV?) and
how about it's accuracy?

Is someone interested to use or has used the HandyBoard in instrumentation?
I plan to make a temperature indicator / pid / fuzzy controller with
communication to a host computer. Should it be possible to use the
Handyboard a/d for temperature reading? I think 8 bits of resolution isn't
enough. The gain amplifier should be no problem, and a cold junction
compensation circuit wouldn't be that difficult too. I've never made
linearization, but I think it won't be a huge problem for the 68hc11.

 Maybe an external 12-bit a/d could fit well for temperature reading. I've
seen one from Texas Instruments that has spi, could that be connected to the
handy board? Can I connect more than one spi external circuit? How do I
diferentiate them in code (addresses?). Sorry, I'm a beginner and I only
dream with the Handyboard.

I'm currently writing supervisory software for pc in Visual Basic 5, it's
not bad. You can make an ActiveX exe for communication, and that gives you a
good multithreading and a separate process. If someone makes supervisory
software we can talk.

Thank you a lot for the attention,
Cesar Mello
