dear readers and fred martin

my DC motor comes with a 10 pin optical encoder(supply current-10mA)
how do i connect my encoder part to the handy board?
can i ignore the encoder?
my robot only needs to sense retroreflective white tape, can i just
use suitable sensors instead of using encoders?   ( The pins I listed
are just for details)
hope to hear from u soon
thankx
   pin 1- GND
   pin 2- Vcc
   pin 3- dir
   pin 4-standyby
   pin 5 and 6  - A1 and A2
   pin 7 &8     - B1 and B2
   pin 9 and 10 - Z1 and Z2

from jeremy
