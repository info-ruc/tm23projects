You don't need to put that code into eeprom=2E  Just put the code inside a
main() function block like this:
void main(void)
{
  YOUR CODE
}
Be sure and include the start button logic at the start of your code=2E  The
handyboard with start and automaticly execute the main function=2E  The
battery will keep the code in RAM when the board is switched "off"=2E

Hi
I have an IC program (c text format), and I want to download this
program to the eeprom of the handyboard and run it without having
connection with the host PC (remove the phone cable) and use the start
button to run=2E How I can convert my c file to an s19 file so I can
download it into the eeprom???
Thanx

Baraki
