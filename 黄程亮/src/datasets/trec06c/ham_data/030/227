Since the System 3000 servos appear to be made by Futaba, and they specify a
standard Futaba "J" connector, my guess is that they would plug right in.
Futaba practice is as you state: red=5V, black=common, white=signal.

Hello again,

I am using a Tower Hobbies System 3000 servo motor on my expansion
board.  Does anyone know if the black, red, and white wire match up with
ground, 5 volts, and control respectively for that particular brand of
servo motor?
