Subject: expansion board - servo control


Hi,

I stopped working with the handyboard for a while but just started back up
again.  I put the expansion board onto my handyboard and began testing it.
After testing the general tests done before with just the handyboard I
started testing the servo ports.

I am having some trouble with controlling the ports though.  When I enter
init_expbd_servos(int action); from the computer via IC, the motor turns
completely clockwise.  It does not matter what my integer is as long as it
is not zero.  I am not sure what the action variable should be in any case.
I also am unable to change the direction of the servo no matter what action
value is given or what value I give servo0, the port that the motor is
plugged into.

Can anyone give me any suggestions as to how to control the servo?

Thanks,

AhHa!

The expansion board lives!  I hope that now we all have winter break we'll
start to hear from the other beta testers again.
I know I've been slacking due to other commitments and an unrelated comm
problem with my HB, but I'm anxious to get with it again as soon as I finish
my ^#&@( shopping.
Anyhoo, though I left it home (I'm at work, and didn't want the temptation)
I'll try to help from my somewhat rusty memory of my servo experiments:
1. The servo control function does not load by default, make sure you load
it.
2. Not all servo pinouts match the Futaba standard used on the board; I had
to swap leads on my Airtronics servos.

Hope this helps!
