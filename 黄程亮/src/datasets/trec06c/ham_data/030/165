How about lifting pint 8 of the L293 chip and running a wire from it to a 7805
regulator (not the one used for logic).  You could also run the wire to a
separate battery pack.  4 NiCds in series gets you real close to 5V with no
regulator.  In motor circuits, it is important to reduce loss.  See page 49 of
the technical Reference for a schematic of the motor outptu section.
