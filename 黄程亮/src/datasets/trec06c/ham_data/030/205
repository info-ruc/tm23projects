Subject: dc motor output control? Please help!

hi everyone,

i need some help on controling the output voltage of the dc motor ports. the
o/p of the motor port is 12V. but my motor required voltage is only 3V.

i like to know if there is any way to clamp down
the voltage to 5V or lesser. 

i try using a enternal resistor of 8 ohms 5 watts to reduced the voltage
across the motor and also write a sample program to on the motor for 1 sec.
but the motor is always stalled. the HB will be in the reset mode causing
the motor port to be on continuously. however after toggling the on/off
switch for about 5 times, there are 2 kinds of situation forming up.

situation 1:
the o/p of the port is very unstable. it on/off for 1 to 2 time then allow
HB to end the sample program i write.

situation 2:
motor port 0: green led on
motor port 1: red led on
motor port 2: red led on
motor port 3: red led on
the HB is in the reset mode again.

please help!!!

Thanks

Michael
