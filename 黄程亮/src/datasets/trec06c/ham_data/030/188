	I am doing something very similar, but instead I am trying to follow a
black line on a white background.  Either way, I am using IR detectors an=
d
emitters.  They are readily available and work very well.  I'm sorry I ha=
ve
never used an encoder to know how to hook it up, but IR works pretty well
once fine tuned a little bit.  If you have questions how the IR works giv=
e
me a email and I'll explain it to you.
