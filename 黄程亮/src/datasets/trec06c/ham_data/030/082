On a lark, I'll suggest that perhaps U6 is damaged.  If you have another 
74HC138 around, try swapping it for the one on your HB.  I had a 
"similar" problem (although not identical) and was able to diagnose the 
74HC138 as the problem.

I too was seeing occassional failures to come up and often saw instead 
the 16 black elements across the LCD display.

I also saw that when I removed the LCD while the board was running and 
re-inserted it, I often also go the 16 black elements.  I don't know if 
this helps shed any light.

I have now 3 Handy Boards and one was not working correctly.  I was able 
to narrow it down to U5 or U6 and with a simple chip swap with one of the 
good HB's found it to be the 74HC138.  BTW, everytime I pulled the chip, 
all the p_code had to be re-downloaded again - pulling the chip seems to 
do a complete brain drain.

If you have an extra 74HC138 lying around, it's certainly worth a try.
