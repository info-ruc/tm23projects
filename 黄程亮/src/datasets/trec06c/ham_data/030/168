Hi everybody,
When the one end of the RJ11 cable plug into the RJ12 side entry(J10), it
supposed the red LED on the charger board will light up. However, it failed
to light up. Hence, this made the booststrap failed and I unable to
download the P_code.

When I plug in the adapter into the Power Jack J11 on the charger board,
the red LED light up but NOT  the yellow LED.  In this case, I able to
download the P_code successfully. 

When I plug in the adapter into the HD instead the charger board, I unable
to download the P_code. There is no yellow and red LED light up.

I did a measurement on the voltage drop on the voltage regulator (U17) on
the charger board. From Pin 1, the voltage drop is 1.2V only as it is
supposed to be 9.6v . The voltage measured from pin 3 is also 1.2 voltage
as is should be 5v. 

please advice.

rgds,
phillip
