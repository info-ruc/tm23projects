please download these files from the HB web site and put them in the
ic-libraries folder.  then use resedit to modify IC to have lib_hb.lis
as its default library file.

testmotors() is defined in hbtest.c.  you must specifically get
hbtest.c from teh HB web site, put it in your ic-libraries fiolder,
and then tyope "load hbtest.c" from the IC cmd line.
