I've never hot HBDL to work, and I've tried it on a 386 (laptop), 486 and
Pentium. Don't know why: just won't work under win3.11 win95 or win98. The
DOS one I've used with quite a bit of success. Make sure you are
restarting the computer (ie, turning it physically of  and physically
back on) in MS-DOS. If you go to start-->shut down-->restart in MS-DOS
mode you'll still have resident Windows drivers (don't believe me? Try
typing in 'win'. It will boot up faster than when you load it under a cold
boot.  Also, don't load config.sys and autoexec.bat (IE, go straight to
DOS prompt) You'll need to type

path=c:\;c:\ic\libs

etc. but you should no longer have conflicts. Also, check to see the COM1
setting in the BIOS. Best bet is to have it on ? 278H ?
