Richard,

	Thanks for the help. I finally got the board to accept the pcode.
I acquired a PS/2 mouse to free up my COM1 port. I used the HBDL.exe program
that came with the board. After several unsuccessfully attempts to program
the board, for some reason it finally worked. I found that it really helped
to let the serial interface board cool off before trying to use it. It is
also still very inconsistent. Sometimes I can get IC to recognize the board,
most of the time not. Windows or DOS doesn't matter, (I tried creating a
basic boot disk as recommended by one of the other responses, but that does
not seem to help.)
So here's my question. Does your serial interface board run hot, i.e.
noticeably hot to the touch. On my serial interface board (version 1.1 as
printed on the board) the white ceramic block gets very hot along with the
power chip? in the middle. If I had a bad power chip, would it cause these
symptoms, especially inconsistent performance!!!
BTW, how much was the power chips from Newark? Thanks for the help!!!

Bill:
I had a defective DS1233 power monitor chip which kept resetting the board
about the same time as your's aborts. Watch the LEDs on the HB and see if
both go on and you hear a beep when the D/L aborts. If that's the case,
replace the DS1233 (I think that I may have spares, having ordered 5 from
Newark Electronics).
