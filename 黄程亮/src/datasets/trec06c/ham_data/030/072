Hi FThompson, Fred and other,
I encountered some problem in the downloading. I was successfully able to
 download the p_code into the HD. However, When the instruction proned me
to reset the board,it always appears on the LCD without any lettering like
"version 3.1...."on it . It is just blank with '16 dark squares' printing
on the LCD.

Besides, the computer showed synchronised with board, retrying ......After
several try, occassionally the lettering of the version 3.1 appear on  LCD
after reset the board. However, the computer showed synchronised with
board...., retrying .....
The situation is that it cannot initiatize the interrupt for standard lib
to down load into the   HB. Please help. Is it batteries problem ?is it any
chips damaged? We are using NIcad 9.6 v currently.
