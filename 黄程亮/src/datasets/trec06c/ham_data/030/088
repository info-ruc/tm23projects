Hi Fred and others,
I very desperate to debug the problem that took place in my HD.  When I
download the P_code, it is successfully downloaded. However, when the next
instruction ask to reset the board, no words of sentence appear on the LCD.
Only 16 dark squares appear on the LCD.  I have tried many times, it is
still in vain . 

Moreover, I have even tried to changed almost all the IC chips and it is
still no result. Except the 68HC11 and 74hc373 (U3) I did not change. I
have test out each signal is going fine. Besides, I have changed the DS1233
,it is still in vain .

I got this problem since last week. I have been working well with the HD
very well all the while. Suddenly, when the next morning I switch on the
board, such thing happen.

Please help me asap. I really very desperate and do not know what to do . I
have to submit the project 3 weeks times.

rgds,
chia
