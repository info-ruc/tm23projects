we are developing a small rover here at V.E.S. Institute of technology,
India and we are using DC motors made by a manufacturer here in
Bombay,India. They make all kinds of DC motors and special internally geared
motors having the ratings that we require. These motors are available in the
range of RS. 960-1100 ($25 only) .
And are available at student discount rates of about 650-700 ($15). But then
shipment would be a problem for you :: In case you are still interested I
will try to get a mailing address of the dealers or would pass on their
phone numbers to you.
