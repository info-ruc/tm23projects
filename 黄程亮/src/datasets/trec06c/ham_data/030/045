Watch the critical angle for the sonar too.  If the sonar doesn't hit
almost straight on, some of the energy will be reflected off at an
angle, and may provide false longer distances.  Smooth surfaces will
have a lower critical angle then coarse surfaces.

   Angle reflection longer measurement.


Good mapping will take a combination of sensors, and actual wandering
of the room to detect all obstacles and make an accurate map.  Decide
your grid size, and program the robot to get to each size area, and
mark the grid as open or filled.
