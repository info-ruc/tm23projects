Hi friends!

Thank you for the replies about this topic. Now I could get a Reference
Manual too...

The a/d range is determined by the references given to the VrefH and VrefL
pins. But be careful about this:

"There should be at least 2.5V between VREFL and VREFH for full A/D
accuracy. Lower values will result in more inaccuracy, but the converter
will continue to operate. The A/D system is tested at 4.5 and 5.5V across
the reference supply pins."

See you,
Cesar
