     Thanks for your reply. 

     To answer your question about position control, let me describe my 
application. I have an Handyboard, stepper motor, and a linear system 
(ball-screw), and I would like to control the position of the part 
mounted on the nut of the ball-screw (x). 
     
     Hence, I will be using only one stepper motor, and I will very 
appreciate it if you can tell me what type of stepper motor is more 
suitable (single pole or dual), and is there any programs already ready 
to control those motors. 

     I am also wondering about the position error of the stepper motor, 
is it repeatable or how good is its position accuracy.
