So here's my question. Does your serial interface board run hot, i.e.
noticeably hot to the touch. On my serial interface board (version 1.1 as
printed on the board) the white ceramic block gets very hot along with the
power chip? in the middle. If I had a bad power chip, would it cause these
symptoms, especially inconsistent performance!!!
BTW, how much was the power chips from Newark? Thanks for the help!!!

Your MAX232 chip may be bad, but you should also check or proactively
replace the four 10uF caps (C10, 11, 12, 13) which the '232 uses to generate
the 10V needed for serial comm.  If one of these is flakey it could
interfere with serial comm and possibly fry the '232.
