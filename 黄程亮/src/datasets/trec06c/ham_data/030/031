Dear Mr. David Teretski,
It has come to my attention that you are fraudulently using my
Personal Pin #xx on your web site  in your attempt to slander
21st Century Global Network.  If you do not CEASE AND DESIST and remove =
this immediately I will forward your html document to the proper
authorities in your state for prosecution of " Theft of Services".
I own that pin # , and all legal rights to it by paying for that number =
through my voice mail system. I find it hard to believe
that your school pays for you to publicly slander other companies
and to spend your time for such garbage.  I guess it goes to show what =
little men with little minds have to do all day.
I sincerely hope you are not spending tuition money on your little =
venture.
This will be your last warning, If it is not removed asap I will turn =
this over to the proper authorties at once.
Sincerely,
Bernard R. Johnson
1-248-332-6526
P. S. thank you for the leads it did generate, but CEASE and DESIST!
P.S.S. this is being forwarded to your entire falculty along with the =
web site address!
