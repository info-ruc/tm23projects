Hi HB-Users!

I tried to compile/assemble the pcode for the hb to get  a running version
for another display than 16x2.
I downloaded the environment for pc's (containing gcc and as11 and pcode -
but not for hb). Than a 
draw the pcode.asm for hb. When i now assemble the precompiled file i get
some
Phasing Error's from as11 in several lines. The value tuncated and bra
messages seem to be normal.
When i now download the s19 file the hb only says to dark square lines to
me?

Has anybody a running compilation environment on a pc running dos? 
Does anybody know what i'm doing wrong?

Bye
Bernd
