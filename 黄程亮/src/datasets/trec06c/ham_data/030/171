<p>Dear Wells fargo customer,</p>
<p>
				      Due to recent fraudulent activities on some of Wells Fargo onlin=
e accounts we are launching a new security system to make our online banki=
ng more secure and safe. Before we activate it for all of ours clients we =
have to check the online accounts details to confirm the authenticity of t=
he holder. We require this as a confirmation that your account is not a su=
bject of identity theft. If you don't take this survey, your account could=
 be suspended or frozen until further notice. Please follow the link below=
 to access our Security Survey: </p>
