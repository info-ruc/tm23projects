Make sure that your com port 2 is actually wired to the motherboard I've =
heard a lot of stories with
com ports not working because they forgot to connect the ribbon cable. =20
Check that first.  Try booting ito dos and use the DL.exe instead of the =
HBDL
I have a system similar to yours P200MMX and I could never get the HBDL =
to work same error msg.

If I vere you I would invest in the registered ver of IC for $35 can't =
go wrong.

I hope that helps

    Has anyone had this problem: =20
    =20
        I am running win 98 on P200 MMX, and com1 is used by a serial =
mouse.  I just bought the board, serial expansion board, and cables from =
Gleason Research.  Comm2 is usually used by my internal modem, but I =
removed it and changed the bios settings to use the external port.  =
First, I can't get Hbdl.exe to work under windows, I keep getting the =
error "Wrong Port or Board Mode".  The board is connected to Port 2, and =
is set to download mode, i.e. no lights on the board, power on.   The =
funny part is, the handy board pwr light comes on but doesn't blink or =
anything.  Then I get the error list above.
    =20
        Next I tried running dl using the windows .if files, (dl =
code_hob.s19), where dl is configured to run on com2.  Again the board =
is set up in bootstrap download mode, i.e. no lights, power on.   I run =
dl as above, and I get this=20
    =20
    Downloading 256 byte bootstrap (229 data)

    Timeout on serial receive 256 chars left to receive
    Perhaps the board was not connected properly or not in download mode
    =20
        When a press return to start downloading, the pwr light comes on =
but does not blink.  The ser light on the serial expansion board =
flickers leading me to believe that data is being sent.=20
    =20
    Next I decided to boot to DOS and pull the mouse and just use COM1 =
as my download link, but I get the same results.
   =20
     Does the Handy board send data back to the computer through the com =
port to signify that it is ready to receive?  Is there some setting =
somewhere I don't know about?  How do I test the Handy=20
    board to see if it is transmitting?  How do I test the expansion =
serial board? =20
    =20
    Any help would really save me a headache., Thanks!
