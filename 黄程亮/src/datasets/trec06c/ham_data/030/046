Has anyone had this problem:

    I am running win 98 on P200 MMX, and com1 is used by a serial mouse.  I
just bought the board, serial expansion board, and cables from Gleason
Research.  Comm2 is usually used by my internal modem, but I removed it and
changed the bios settings to use the external port.  First, I can't get
Hbdl.exe to work under windows, I keep getting the error "Wrong Port or
Board Mode".  The board is connected to Port 2, and is set to download mode,
i.e. no lights on the board, power on.   The funny part is, the handy board
pwr light comes on but doesn't blink or anything.  Then I get the error list
above.

    Next I tried running dl using the windows .if files, (dl code_hob.s19),
where dl is configured to run on com2.  Again the board is set up in
bootstrap download mode, i.e. no lights, power on.   I run dl as above, and
I get this

Downloading 256 byte bootstrap (229 data)
................................................................
................................................................
................................................................
.....................................___________________________

Timeout on serial receive 256 chars left to receive
Perhaps the board was not connected properly or not in download mode

    When a press return to start downloading, the pwr light comes on but
does not blink.  The ser light on the serial expansion board flickers
leading me to believe that data is being sent.

Next I decided to boot to DOS and pull the mouse and just use COM1 as my
download link, but I get the same results.

 Does the Handy board send data back to the computer through the com port to
signify that it is ready to receive?  Is there some setting somewhere I
don't know about?  How do I test the Handy
board to see if it is transmitting?  How do I test the expansion serial
board?

Any help would really save me a headache., Thanks!
