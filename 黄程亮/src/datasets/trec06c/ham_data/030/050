I built two more Handyboards and I've noticed something odd.  When I 
download a program with a main() function, and reset the board, main() 
does not get executed.  I thought it was supposed to.

I'm using IC v3.1 (for the Mac) and Handyboard version 1.2.  IC says 
pcode version 3.10 is on the board.  Am I missing something here or could 
I have a hardware problem?
