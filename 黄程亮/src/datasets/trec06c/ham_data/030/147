I'm not sure my previous mail came through but I have gone high-speed by
cable (150 Mbit) and had a change of address. Can you please be so kind to
change my Handyboard mailing list subscriber address from jaron@cybercomm.nl
to j.paludanus@cable.a2000.nl. I still appreciate your list very much
although I haven't had time to do something with my HB for a while now.
