I've had a similar problem, make sure your servo power is fully charged.  An
undercharged system will sometimes drive all the way one way.

	Hello,

	I emailed this to the handy board list and got one response. I am
mailing
	it back hoping that I can get some more responses from those on the
list
	and perhaps fred.
