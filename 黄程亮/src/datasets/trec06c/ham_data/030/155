Try this link.
http://incolor.inetnebr.com/bill_r/polaroid%20sonar%20mod.htm.  It shows
modifications for interfacing the one step board to a microcontroller.
I also have an old one step ($1 at a garage sale) but I have not tried
the modifications shown for use with the handyboard.  I have taken the
camera apart and it seems to match the photos and diagrams shown at this
site but that was as far as I got.  I would be interested to hear how
you or anyone else may get it to work with the handyboard.  Good luck.

John
