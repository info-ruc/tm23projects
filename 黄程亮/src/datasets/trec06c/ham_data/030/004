Hi folks!

Here is my current shop list, as soon as I have my Handyboard here I'll try
to make a complete shop list.

1) First option: buy the unassembled kit from Pattrick Hui's Robot Store in
Hong Kong. Order by mail huip@hkstar.com. The standard unassembled price is
US$ 170.00, I bought the kit with a registered Interactive C that costs US$
190.00. Very nice option for who has the money.  Mr. Hui is very cool. PS: I
think it comes without the batteries, take a look at the site.

2) Build it yourself: I'll place the components I'm importing from USA here.
I'm not including the motor drivers because I plan to use the handyboard for
data acquisition and maybe to replace a Siemens S7 315 PLC! This is a
Handyboard option for poor people as me, so I'm including only the
essentials. The capacitors and resistors aren't included too, because this I
can buy here in Brazil.

PS: I'm researching this from Brazil only through the Internet, so maybe you
can find something wrong. If someone wants me to send news please tell me.
