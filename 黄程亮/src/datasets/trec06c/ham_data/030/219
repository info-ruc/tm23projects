hI FRed, anothony and others,
I just plug in the RJ11 in the HD and charger board. It supposed that the
red LED on the charger board should light up. It failed to light up. When I
plug in the adaptor onto the charger board, the red LED light up but NOT
the yellow LED. However, it still cannot download the P_code.
Hence, I still encounter the booststrap download failed. I have changed the
rectifier and voltage regulator . There is no result of it. I have tried to
use the RJ11 on a good charger  board which from my friend. It has no
problem. Hence, this deduce that the RJ11 has no fault. I've also changed
the MAX232 chip. The booststrap still failed. 

You have mentioned thatthe capactors may be the fault. WHY ??? I did not
try that to change. 

Besides the changing the capacitor, it there any other possibility that the
booststrap failed ? Please advice.

thank you .


Rgds,
phillip chia
