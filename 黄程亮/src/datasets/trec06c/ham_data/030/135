Hi
I have an IC program (c text format), and I want to download this 
program to the eeprom of the handyboard and run it without having 
connection with the host PC (remove the phone cable) and use the start 
button to run. How I can convert my c file to an s19 file so I can 
download it into the eeprom???
Thanx

Baraki
