<Serving DNS>

The paper proposes an alternative secure DNS using the hashtable
interface provided by a p2p overlay in a straightforward way. The system
takes advantage of Chord's fault tolerance and load balancing
properties, and eliminates the administrative issues faced by the
current DNS deployment. The namespace authority entities are thus
decoupled from where the data entries are stored. Although resolved
lookups are cached along the return path, the latency incurred by the
system is considerable compared with the default DNS (median response
time of 350ms as opposed to 43ms in favor of the conventional system).

Replicating entries only to six sites to begin with might not be enough,
and data could be lost before request replies store cached copies. Also
network partitions may yield unexpected scenarios when nodes are unable
to lookup names that are part of the same organization because they have
been hashed on the other edge of the Internet, while a hierarchical DNS
would only sever the connection to the outer world and allow lookup
resolves to names in a common subtree.

<CoDoNS>

The paper presents the implementation of a backward - compatible
alternative DNS system that, like the previous paper is build on top of
a structured DHT. Aside the fact that it takes advantage of the same
properties  given by a p2p underlying overlay (like load ballancing ,
failure resilience and authority - location decoupling), CoDoNS also
addresses the low latency problem using proactive replication. The
Beehive replication framework provides an analytical solution to optimal
replica placement when the popularity of the items obey a power law
distribution, and it is well known that DNS lookups do obey such a model.

At the moment, if a lookup is routed towards a home node that does not
have the record, another DNS query is issued towards the legacy DNS
system. In such a scenario, the latency of a cold start could be
significant.
