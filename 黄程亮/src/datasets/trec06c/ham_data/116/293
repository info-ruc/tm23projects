DFG Passes Open Access Guidelines

Information for Researchers No. 04 30 January 2006

In 2003 the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research 
Foundation) signed the Berlin Declaration on Open Access to Knowledge in 
the Sciences and Humanities. The DFG supports the culture of open access. 
Unhindered access to publications increases the distribution of scientific 
knowledge, thereby enhancing the authors' visibility and contributing to 
their reputations.

The DFG has now tied open access into its funding policy. During their 
meetings in January 2006, the DFG's Senate and Joint Committee recommended 
encouraging funded scientists to also digitally publish their results and 
make them available via open access.

In order to put secondary publications (i.e. self-archived publications by 
which the authors provide their scientific work on the internet for free 
following conventional publication) on the proper legal footing, scientists 
involved in DFG-funded projects are also requested to reserve the 
exploitation rights.

Recommendations are currently being integrated into the usage guidelines, 
which form an integral part of every approval. They are worded as follows:

"The DFG expects the research results funded by it to be published and to 
be made available, where possible, digitally and on the internet via open 
access. To achieve this, the contributions involved should either be 
published in discipline-specific or institutional electronic archives 
(repositories), or directly in referenced or recognised open access 
journals, in addition to conventional publishing.

When entering into publishing contracts scientists participating in 
DFG-funded projects should, as far as possible, permanently reserve a 
non-exclusive right of exploitation for electronic publication of their 
research results for the purpose of open access. Here, discipline-specific 
delay periods of generally 6-12 months can be agreed upon, before which 
publication of previously published research results in discipline-specific 
or institutional electronic archives may be prohibited.

Please ensure that a note indicating support of the project by the DFG is 
included in the publication."

The revised usage guidelines are expected to be available in April 2006.
