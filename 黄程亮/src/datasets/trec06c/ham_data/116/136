ACM Bulletin - March 2, 2006 
Today's Topic: ACM Announces 2005 A.M. Turing Award Winner
 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
ACM has named Peter Naur the winner of the 2005 A.M. Turing Award, 
recognizing his pioneering work on defining the Algol 60 programming 
language. Algol 60 is the model for many later programming languages, 
including those that are indispensable software engineering tools today.  

The Turing Award, widely considered the "Nobel Prize of Computing," is 
named for British mathematician Alan M. Turing. First awarded in 1966, 
it carries a $100,000 prize, with financial support provided by 
Intel Corporation.

http://www.acm.org/2005_turing_award

Dr. Naur was instrumental in establishing software engineering as a 
discipline. In 1960, Dr. Naur was editor of the hugely influential "Report 
on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60."  He is recognized for the report's 
elegance, uniformity and coherence, and credited as an important contributor

to the language's power and simplicity. The report made pioneering use of 
what later became known as Backus-Naur Form (BNF) to define the syntax of 
programs. BNF is now the standard way to define a computer language. 
Dr. Naur is also cited for his contribution to compiler design and to the 
art and practice of computer programming.

ACM will present the Turing Award at the annual ACM Awards Banquet on 
May 20, 2006, in San Francisco, CA.
