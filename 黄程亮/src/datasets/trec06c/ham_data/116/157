Thank you, Jonathan, for your help again.
Although I had tried the <svp start> parameter at one stage, I had 
confounded it by an incorrect setting of another parameter.  Thanks to your 
advice, the script now works as needed.

In case it might be useful to anyone else, a summary and example follows:

Task: Auditory lexical decision with  a fixed interval between onsets of 
wav files and wav files of various lengths.

! Refresh rate = 16.59ms.
! Inter-onset interval of 2600 ms set by frame duration of %140 ticks + 
delay of 15 ticks between items + 1 tick for empty frame "/ ;".
! Inter-onset interval constant regardless of participants response.
! Minimum <delay> value set to be greater than longest "Preparation time" 
in ms diagnostics output.
! RTs measured from the onset of the wav files by inclusion of <svp start>.
! RT time out 2300 ms.  Value of  <time out> required to be less than 
duration of frame.
! In example, the wavs "1500ms" and "500ms" would be words and wav "1000ms" 
would be a nonword
! For illustration, the items are not yet scrambled

<ep> <n 7> <azk> <cr> <NoFeedback> <d 15> <t 2300> <id "QPIO12"> <id 
"keyboard"> <dbc 0>
<dwc 255255255> <vm 1024,768,768,8,0> </ep>

0 "Press spacebar to begin"/;
9999 <ms% 1000> "Fingers on the buttons please"/<ms% 2000>/;

+101 * <svp start><wav 2>"1500ms" %140 /;
-201 * <svp start><wav 2>"1000ms" %140 /;
+102 * <svp start><wav 2>"500ms" %140 /;

+103  * <svp start><wav 2>"1500ms" %140 /;
-202  * <svp start><wav 2>"1000ms" %140 /;
+104  * <svp start><wav 2>"500ms" %140 /;
+105  * <svp start><wav 2>"1500ms" %140 /;

0 <ms% 1000>/<ms% 1000> "The End.  Thank you!"/;

Your help is much appreciated,
Sally Butterfield
