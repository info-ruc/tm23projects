Industrial action still going ahead - 'employers must make an offer' says AUT  	

* 	The AUT confirmed today that next week's industrial action is going ahead as planned after the employers' group, the Universities and Colleges Employers' Association (UCEA), revealed yesterday that it would not meet with the unions until later this month. 	

* 	In a letter to the AUT, the chair of UCEA Geoffrey Copland, wrote 'we are making arrangements for meetings on the afternoon of Tuesday 28 March and on Tuesday 25 April, and will arrange such further dates as may prove necessary? I can confirm that it is the employers' intention to make an offer at an early stage in these negotiations.'

AUT general secretary, Sally Hunt, said she was 'baffled' by the letter, which appears to promise a pay offer, but not until the end of the month. Members of the AUT, along with sister union NATFHE, will strike on Tuesday (7 March) and begin an assessment boycott the following day (8 March).

The unions have been asking the employers to settle the pay claim since the autumn. The employers have yet to make any kind of pay offer at all and until they do so the industrial action will continue as planned.

AUT general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: 'Our position is quite clear and the employers are fully aware of it. The industrial action starts next week and will continue until the employers make us an acceptable offer that we can put to our members.

'If the employers know they are going to make an offer at these meetings why don’t they do it now so that millions of students do not have to suffer? I am baffled by their approach, which can only harm students and staff. The pay dispute could have been settled by now if they had spent the last couple of months holding talks and making pay offers, instead of trying to sabotage our industrial action ballot.

'Our members have endured enough false dawns and broken promises from the employers and our action will be called off when we have a proper offer and not before. We will meet them of course but the time for them to act on pay is now, not in a month’s time.'
