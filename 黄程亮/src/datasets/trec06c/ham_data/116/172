CS352-ers,

I wanted to let you know about an interesting upcoming presentation:

AMD Opteron Microarchitecture
March 28, 2006 - 2-3pm
ACES 2.402

The speaker is Michael Clark. Mike is an AMD Fellow and one of the key 
designers
of the current (and future) line of AMD microprocessors.

You should take the opportunity to see a talk like this.  While you may 
not understand everything, you should be prepared to understand the 
basic ideas of the microarchitecture.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
