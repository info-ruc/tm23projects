These papers make attempts to introduce fairness and accountability in 
p2p networks. They challenge the assumption that all peers willingly 
contribute a decent share of resourses to the global pool. Fairness is 
achieved by using cryptographic receipts/signatures about 
resources/services consumed.

Karma

Instead of explaining how it works, I will try to challenge the 
assumptions it makes about the economics of such a system. The implicit 
assumption made is that for a typical object in the system, there exist 
an equilibrium of supply/demand that is for a non-zero price (i.e. 
different from "free"). However, when two suppliers offer completely 
identical products/services, the differentiation that the customer makes 
is solely on price. Therefore, the "market" price of the object will 
converge towards the marginal cost of producing it, which in the case of 
digital goods, such as multimedia files, is zero. Supplier can try to 
offer slightly different "services" by charging more because of their 
higher bandwidth, but as we noticed in the previous papers, file sharing 
is a batch-mode system.

Once an object is introduced in the system, its price will reach zero or 
close to zero very quickly. The smallness of the price will depend 
probably on the size of the object, so the system will converge in a 
"per megabyte" contribution scheme. If peers really wants to make Karma, 
they need to insert new objects, ideally popular ones. The price of a 
high-demand object will initially be very high, probably more than most 
peers can afford. Once a number of peers download it, the price will 
quickly spiral to zero. That is fine for most users, again, judging from 
the "batch-mode" usage pattern.

This "market" will be segmented into a very small number of peers who 
introduce the new and popular objects and have very high Karma, and the 
rest who have little or no Karma and practically run on the same old 
"free" p2p network.

Sharp and PPay

The two systems are quite similar. They use crypto signatures to create 
and verify "tickets" or "coins". The signature scheme allows for 
non-repudiation to be introduced, that is, a consumer may deny the 
consumption of a resource and is not liable for purchases that cannot be 
proven. The archiecture uses a scheme of layered signatures so that 
faulty peers can be identified along the path. Unlike Karma, Sharp and 
PPay require super peers to do the job of centralized brokers.

One problems with such approach is that a user may join under a 
different identity every time they want to download a certain file, 
similar to downloading the trial version of a product every time it 
expires. Since there can be guards against that, a user may 
alternatively simulate a number of identities and exchange dummy files 
between the controlled peers so that the Karma is accumulated in a 
single node. This Sybil attack can be made more successful if 
(ironically) the abusing peer pays Karma to correct peers to solve the 
crypto puzzles given upon system entry.
