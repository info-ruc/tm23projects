This is a particularly timely email from Justine Stephens, as I have already received an enquiry from someone whose head of department has asked if they are going on strike.  You are not obliged to tell them.

Dear All,



A (relatively!) brief but important email!

Guidance on Strike and Action Short of a Strike (ASOS):


A large number of members have contacted us asking if they should respond
to management enquiries regarding participation in industrial action.
Please note and pass on to all your colleagues that if you receive any such
communication from management that you are under *NO* obligation to inform
management (HR/HoD etc) in *ADVANCE* as to whether you will be taking part
in strike action or action short of a strike. If members are approached
*AFTER* the strike date we do advise you to indicate that you did partake
in strike action.

In terms of Action Short Of a Strike (ASOS) the advice is again, you do NOT
need to notify you HoD/line manager etc in advance. Once ASOS has begun and
if you are approached, you are advised to indicate that yes, you are
participating in the action. You do NOT need to inform which SPECIFIC
duties that means you as an individual will not be doing. You SHOULD rather
reply that you are taking part in ASOS as outlined by the formal
notification received from AUT nationally.



For full, comprehensive guidance please refer members to:
http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/1/c/aut_guidetoaction.pdf (general
guidance) http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/1/n/aut_lapicketingguidance.pdf
(strike guidance) http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1523 (ASOS
guidance). Please direct any specific enquiries to Paul Cottrell:
paul.cottrell@aut.org.uk



A number of LAs have requested detailed advice regarding the possible
implications on pensions. Please find the guidance here (thanks to Bill!):
http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/1/c/industrialactionandpensions.pdf



A few institutions have issued threats to withhold pay from members
participating in the student assessment boycott. Some have said that a
proportion of pay will be withheld; one or two have even threatened to stop
all pay until members agree to resume their full duties. We will examine
the legality of all such threats and respond accordingly.  But the best
response to employers who want to escalate the dispute in this way is to
strengthen the action.



Punitive employers should remember that if pay is docked for work not done,
that work may never be carried out.  Employers will then be responsible for
clearing the "backlog" when the action is over and may find themselves
vulnerable to litigation from students.  IF there is to be ANY work by our
members following the resolution of the dispute to avoid lasting damage to
students, arrangements for carrying out that work will have to be
negotiated with us.  We won't even contemplate entering into negotiations
until the pay withheld from our members has been restored to them. Watch
the website for more information.



Local Offers?

If you are approached by your management about the possibility of a local
offer thank them for recognising the need for a substantial increase,
inform them that the pay claim is a national claim and ask that they
channel their efforts into persuading UCEA to make a national offer.



Strike materials:

The majority of LAs have now received the materials (all Welsh materials
ARE on their way due to arrive tomorrow/Friday!). If you have not received
them, please contact Justine.stephens@aut.org.uk



Strike day details:

..........are now available on the web here:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1542 If you note that your event
is missing, or you have additional details, please email
Justine.stephens@aut.org.uk



All the best, Justine
