Subject: [DMDX] fixed inter-onset interval for wavs of various lengths

Hello

I'd like to use DMDX for an auditory lexical decision task.  My wav files vary 
in length, but I want their  inter-onset interval (i.e. from start of one wav 
to wav in the next item) to be a fixed interval.   Is this possible in DMDX 
somehow or will I need to make my wav files all the same length?

The following is just given as a skeleton: it -- i.e. the frame duration 
parameter doesn't now do what I want, but could it or some other combination of 
parameters?  Apologies if I've overlooked relevant info in the list or help 
files. 

! Refresh rate = 16.59 ms
! Inter-onset interval needs to be 2600 ms

+101 * <wav 2> "balustrade"/;
-201 * <wav 2> "blen"/;

Thank you for advice,
