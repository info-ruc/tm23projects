SEMINAR -- Department of Computer and Information Science

Interfacing Massively Parallel Associative Computers for Database Applicati=
ons

Michael Scherger, Ph.D.
Department of Computer Science
Kent State University

Monday, 6 March, 10:00 a.m.
235 Weir Hall

Associative processing is the use and extension of associative memories int=
o a
more general computational environment, in which special purpose hardware is
used to search and process large memories and databases.  As an application=
 of
data parallel and associative computing, this presentation will discuss the
design and development of a parallel database server for a prototype SIMD
parallel processor.  The database server stores all data in the parallel
memory space of the computer (parallel memory-resident database).  The SIMD
parallel processor has the capability to dynamically address the parallel
memory space using parallel pointers; however the number of processing
elements is fixed during program execution.  A coalescing parallel memory
manger was designed and developed to create =E2=80=9Ctable folds=E2=80=9D (=
a form of virtual
parallel processing) when the number of data elements exceeded a multiple of
the number processing elements.  Using a database server toolkit, the paral=
lel
memory API was interfaced with an SQL engine to create a parallel database
server that is capable of performing parallel searches, updates, insertions,
and deletions.  The toolkit also provided a mechanism to create a custom OD=
BC
compliant database client-server driver for Microsoft Windows and UNIX
platforms to interface with existing applications.  The design of a second
parallel memory manager will also be introduced using multiple instruction
streams access to the parallel memory space and allowing several database
transactions to occur in parallel.

Michael Scherger received a B.S. in Electronic Technology in 1991 and a
B.S. degree in Computer Science in 1992 from the University of Akron.  He
received a M.S. in Computer Science in 1995 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science=
 in
2005 from Kent State University.  His dissertation is titled =E2=80=9CAn Ob=
ject Model
=46ramework, Runtime Environment Support, and Database System Software for a
Multiple Instruction Stream Associative Model of Computation=E2=80=9D.  His=
 research
interests are in parallel, distributed, high performance, and associative
computing systems, parallel runtime environment systems, massively parallel
and associative database systems, artificial intelligence, software
engineering, image processing and computer vision, and computational
chemistry.  Presently he is an instructor of Computer Science at Kent State
University.

Scherger is a candidate for a faculty position in the CIS Department.
