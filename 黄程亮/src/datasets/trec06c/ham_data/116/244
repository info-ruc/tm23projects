Hello Alfredo
I've seen your tutorial video clips about CmapTools. Great !=20
I'm now teaching CmapTools in Cambodia and those clips would be helpful.
Unfortunatly the internet connections are very poor and very expansive =
for Cambodians. Is there anyway to download your video clips ?
Thank you very much

CmapTools,=20

  These videos are made with "captivate" in italian, spanish and =

help you to find other potential partners for such collaboration.=20

    Hi everyone,

    I am thinking of making some screen video tutorials for Cmaptools to
    assist graduate medical students getting started with mapping.  I'd
    like to cover the basics of concept mapping, sharing maps through=20
    places, and some advanced topics like collaborating on maps.

    I would be interested in suggestions from the group as to the areas
    that should be covered.   Comments from educators with experience in
    teaching concept mapping would be greatly appreciated. The videos=20
    will have audio, so the text that accompanies the tutorials will
    provide an opportunity not only to highlight how to use the software
    features, but provide some basic starting points for building
    effective maps.=20

    I have some experience using Camtasia studio for making maps (on PC)
    and SnapZ Pro (OSX), and I think these approaches will prove an
    effective way for creating the tutorials.  You can see some examples
    under video tutorials at http://oceanbrowser.com/support/index.html

    One approach might be to make a tutorial video map, where each
    concept has an attached audio or video commentary.=20

    Ideas, suggestions or comments from the group would be appreciated.

    If anyone would be interested in collaborating on this, email me off
    list.

    Regards,

    Rodney
