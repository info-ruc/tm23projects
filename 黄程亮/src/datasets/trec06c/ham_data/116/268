Yeah, not going to happen, sorry.  The \u and a number of other unicode 
control words were added to the RTF specification after or during DMDX's 
design and they're real unicode.  It's interesting looking at your file 
because there are constructs like this:

" \f2\u20776?\f1  \f2\'97\'44\f1  \f2\u20772?\f1  "

It switches back to the 8 bit codes that DMDX can handle (\'97\'44) in the 
middle of two 16 bit codes (\u20776 and \u20772).  I tried replacing 
\u20776 with two 8 bit codes that would be binarily equivalent to it 
however that's not how unicode kludges work apparently.  Word and Wordpad 
can display the characters because they are unicode applications (or at the 
very least unicode aware applications), DMDX isn't and won't be any time soon.
