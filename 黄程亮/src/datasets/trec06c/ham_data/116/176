Hello 

  

As part of the drive to make sure we are setting the agenda next week we need to try and secure as much positive press coverage as possible. The employers press team will be analaysing all the regional cuttings next week and busy picket lines and good local coverage will send them a very strong message. Please find pasted below and attached a template that can be adapted and sent to your local press. Please send this out as early as you can on Monday. If you need contact details for any local paper, radio or TV station then drop Dan an email at dan.ashley@aut.org.uk 

  

The aim of this release is to encourage the local papers, TV and radio to attend your picket line and get some good shots of people outside, so give them details of the one that is likely to be the busiest. Also include full details of the rally or other key events that your local AUT will be attending throughout the day. Make sure you include set times of when everything is happening (nothing is more likely to take the gloss of coverage than making the reporters hang around). 

  

ASSOCIATION OF UNIVERSITY TEACHERS 

  

PRESS RELEASE 

  

date: Monday 6 March 2006 

embargo: Tuesday 7 March 

  

University strike kicks in 

  

Students at YOUR University have no lectures or seminars today (Tuesday) as their lecturers, researchers and administrative, computing and library staff stage a 24 hour walkout as part of their fight for decent pay. YOUR TOWN?CITY's students could face months of uncertainty when an assessment boycott begins on Wednesday. 

  

The assessment boycott will leave YOUR TOWN?CITY's students with coursework unmarked and their exam programmes thrown into chaos if a pay deal cannot be reached. If this becomes a protracted dispute local students could even be prevented from graduating in the summer. 

  

Lecturers will be manning picket lines at GIVE DETAILS AND TIMES HERE WHERE AND WHEN IT WILL BE BUSY IN CASE PHOTOGRAPHERS TURN UP. ALSO GIVE VCLEAR DETAILS AND TIMES OF ANY RALLIES INCLUDING SPEAKERS (SEE BELOW FOR EXAMPLE). The press are welcome to attend. 

  

Example paragraph -- Striking staff will be manning a picket line at the South Gate entrance to Anytown's City Campus on High Street YOUR TOWN/CITY postcode. The press are invited to attend from 8.30-11am. In the afternoon lecturers from Anytown University will be joining colleagues from Nearby University and Regional University for a rally at Anytown Square off Market Road at 2.00pm. Speakers include local MP Joe Bloggs and Anytown AUT President Jo Blurgs. 

  

Members of the Association of University Teachers (AUT) and Natfhe trade unions are taking the action because they say promises to use new money coming into the higher education sector to improve staff pay have been broken. 

  

The unions' pay claim centres around the promise from university vice-chancellors to use the extra money they will receive from top-up fees and government grants to sort out staff pay. When lobbying the government for the introduction of the controversial top-up fees vice-chancellors promised the then higher education minister, Alan Johnson, that a substantial proportion of the new money would be spent on staff pay. 

  

YOUR University AUT President/Secretary/Spokesperson said: "We have no desire whatsoever to put the futures of YOUR TOWN/CITY'S students at risk, but we have had enough of the employers procrastinating on this issue. They must not underestimate our anger or our determination to guarantee a fair settlement. If they do not make a decent pay offer in the next few weeks then we will continue with our action and they are fully aware of consequences for the students." 

  

AUT general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: For too long university staff have had to accept the tired old excuses from vice-chancellors of wanting to pay more, but not having the money. That money is here now. They promised it to us when lobbying for top-up fees. The employers could have stopped this disruption, but they chose not to. I still do not understand why they feel they should wait until the end of the month before making us an offer and hopefully settling the dispute. I would have hoped they did not want to put their students' studies at risk, sadly it appears they value them as poorly as they do their members of staff."
