Jonathan,

I've been having trouble running item files using the USB PIO24
outputs under XP. When I switched to Windows 98, the file ran much
better (i.e. running it didn't cause the machine to lock up). Do you
have any idea why this may have occurred?

Rich

PS: Thanks for the help with outputs. I was able to use them to drive
a 74HCL374 to mimic the function of the handswitch to use as a marker.
