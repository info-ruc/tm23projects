CoDoNS

This paper describes the CoDoNS system that is a peer to peer network for
Domain Name Systems used on the Internet for address translations to
increase performance and resilience to Denial of Service Attacks and
faster propagation of updates. This network is based on the Beehive system
that implements an effective replication policy based on choosing
different levels of replication based on different objects and their
usage. Thus by placing cached copies one level up in the lookup the number
of hops required can be reduced by one at each level. Thus choosing
different levels for different objects based on certain criteria helps in
reducing the latency for a query. AS can be seen from the graphs initially
as the system starts up the latency is high compared to traditional DNS
systems but then as more and more objects are replicated with each request
the latency of the system decreases as more cached copies are returned at
higher levels in the system and thus reducing the number of hops and
latency. The gain in latency is very high and the median latency is around
2 milliseconds compared to around 39 milliseconds for conventional DNS
systems. This system uses public key cryptography to ensure security of
the resources and the certificates are used for data verification between
servers.

Serving DNS using a Peer-to-Peer Lookup Service

This paper also discusses the implementation of a DNS system that is based
on an underlying peer to peer system though the underlying system in this
case is based on Chord unlike beehive in the other paper. The authors
states that their systems performance for DNS lookup is worse than the
conventional lookup by about 10 times they claim that their lookup is
better for searches with high latency and that all their queries would
succeed. This approach seems to suggest a very underperformed system that
is good for only the worst cases.
