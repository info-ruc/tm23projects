   The most common thing to do is to be asking for a response when none are 
mapped.  However any machine where DMDX works the second time and not the 
first has to have some serious problems to begin with.  As with all 
malfunctioning scripts that are locking a machine up turning <Safemode 1> 
on will make DMDX poll for and ESC all the time and you'll at least be able 
gain control again without using the three finger salute.
