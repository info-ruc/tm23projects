  You can always read the help, you'll probably find that I needed to add 
<svp start> in those <wav> frames.

   You will of course be setting the timeout less than the duration of the 
display, <t 2080> or so.

   <svp start> will more than likely fix it.

   Depends what you want the time for, in setting a timeout you want to 
round down.
