Hi fine-grained seminar,

I've looked at the calendar again, and decided that the project proposals
will be due the Thursday after spring break, by email.  The date for this
is March 23.  If you're going away spring break, this means you'll
probably want to do some serious thinking about your project before
leaving for spring break.

I've also updated the other due dates on the web page.

Bill
