PRESS RELEASE							
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE	

Wireless IT-based Teaching Goes Mobile!

SANAKO has introduced a fully mobile IT-based cross-curricular teaching solution
- the Wireless IT-Classroom, consisting of a laptop cart complete with wireless
access point and SANAKO Study 500 teaching software available for installation.
Optional laptop PCs can be purchased from a preferred supplier. This ingenious
Wireless IT-Classroom allows teachers to quickly and easily set up a modern
IT-based learning environment in any space, even in ordinary classrooms with no
IT facilities. In institutions with wireless environments, the laptop cart with
PCs pre-programmed with Study 500 software can expand the reach of
technology-based learning even further!

The cart itself can accommodate up to 24 laptops, and is compatible with nearly
all of the products from leading laptop manufacturers. It comes equipped with
power supply and security features and laptops must be outfitted with wireless
network cards (WLAN 11g) to offer the optimal wireless connectivity for use with
Study 500.

Teachers can simply wheel the trolley into the desired teaching area, distribute
laptops to students and IT-based teaching can begin - with no need to wait for
expensive and time-consuming furniture and hardware installation.

The wireless cart and teaching software allow Sanako and its partners to give
educational institutions access to a complete solution for technology-based
teaching, including cart,  teaching software, wireless network (where necessary)
and laptops, or any combination of elements as needed.

This is the ideal solution for institutions that want to maximize their IT
investments - the mobile laptop classroom can be readily shared among many
teachers and learning groups in an easy and convenient fashion. Customers get an
important bonus in being able to fully secure their mobile teaching environment
with doors that lock independently. 

SANAKO Study 500 is an inexpensive entry-level solution that creates a
stimulating and interactive teaching environment, which makes use of Internet
and IT resources to bring any lesson to life! It can be easily modified to meet
specific teaching needs, simply by installing additional software modules
(available during 2006) that introduce supplementary learning or teaching
activities. Because Study 500 and its extension modules are all-software,
creating an exciting interactive teaching environment is easy - any teacher or
Lab Manager can get the media-enriched classroom up and running in no time!
