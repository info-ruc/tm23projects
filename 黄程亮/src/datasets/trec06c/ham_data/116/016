Plotting and looking is just fine.

One student has asked about ways to approach problem 3.  Here is a
suggestion to those of you who are stuck.  Take a function of your
own chosing and make a correct table of values.  Then twiddle a
couple digits of that table.  Now you have an example of the problem
where you actually know where the mistake is.  Do some experiments
to see what sorts of evidence there is of the corruption.  Working
with a similar problem with a known answer can help inspire you.




A student was asking questions about problem 4.  I want to
emphasize that what you get out at the end will not look like
Muller's method.  It helps to turn the x-y axes sideways and
think about what the function g(y) is and how it is relevant to
where the 0 of f(x) is.



For the error bounds on problem 1, don't go to extreme effort
to compute an exact expression for either the derivative of f
term of the product of (x-x_i) term.  Just pick reasonable upper
bounds on both.



I added a bit more to the walkthrough for problem 4, after helping
a student in office hours today.




I received an email asking if it was ok to raid the programs/
directory for raw materials for your solutions.  As long as you all
understand that what's in that directory comes with no implied or
expressed warrantees (i.e. if there's a bug in there, its your bug)
then that's fine with me.  If you aren't very confident with either
matlab or the material, this can be a good way to tinker around with
both.
Be aware though, that you should be able do such computations
yourself, at least by hand, since the exam (a week from wednesday)
will be closed book and closed computer.  I'll post something this
week about the nature of the exam.
