I'd say you've got shonky video drivers, the item file is straight forward 
and even without PIO12 output DMDX doesn't do the same thing twice -- and 
it should absolutely always repeat the same thing twice.  Try using the 
shortcuts for GeForce and or Rally Bad video drivers and see if the problem 
goes away.
