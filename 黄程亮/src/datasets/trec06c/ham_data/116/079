Each year, the Division of Outreach sponsors the University of Mississippi
Academic Invitational Tournament (UMAIT), a quiz bowl competition for high
school students. This year, UMAIT will be held on Saturday, April 1, 2006,
from 8:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. in Bishop, Conner, and Holman Halls.
Sixty-four teams representing high schools from the southeast area will
compete in a double elimination tournament.

Our past tournaments would not have been successful were it not for the
faculty and staff who have volunteered to serve as judges or as moderators
for the tournaments.

There are three time slots for service. They are as follows:
1.	morning session (8:00 a.m. until 12:00 p.m.), 
2.	afternoon session (1:00 p.m. until 4:30 p.m.), and
3.	day session (8:00 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.).

Duties for the moderators include reading the questions during the round
of competition and recognizing the school and contestant before an answer
is given.

Duties for the judges include determining correct answers to quiz bowl
questions when needed and monitoring teams during competition to ensure
the compliance of the tournament rules.

Complete information will be sent to you upon your volunteering, and a
training session will be held before the competition.

If you would like to help with UMAIT (April 1st) by serving as judge or
moderator, please e-mail Alan Rice by March 21st at oreach12@olemiss.edu.
Please specify your desired time slot and whether you would like to serve
as judge or  moderator.
