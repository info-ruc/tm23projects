Jonathan,
Thank you for your speedy reply and helpful suggestions: I've tried to 
incorporate them and have done a few rough & ready measurements of outputs 
and RTs.  I have a few questions.

I'm aiming to have  a fixed interval of 2600ms from wav onset to wav onset 
and to record RTs from wav onset.

Using the parameters below and three wav files of various lengths, it seems 
that the interval between an item *offset* and the following item's onset 
is ~2600 ms.  For our purposes, I need the wav onset- wav onset interval to 
be 2600 ms.

Also, the duration of the interval seems to depend on whether a response is 
made before or after the wav offset -- i.e. if the response occurs after 
wav offset, then the RT is recorded and the interval is ~2600 ms.  So right 
interval, albeit not intended starting point. However, if the button press 
occurs before wav offset, then no RT recorded and the interval increases to 
~3000 ms.  Of course, we hope that the participants will wait until wav 
offset to respond, but we can't depend on it and we do want to keep the 
inter-onset interval constant. So I need to measure RTs from wav onset and 
I wonder if there's a way to avoid possible interaction between when 
response occurs and the inter wav onset interval?

Finally, a general question ... it's tick talk time:  Is it generally best 
to round *down* to the nearest tick - e.g. in this instance, for 2600 ms / 
16.59 ms per tick = 156.7 so 156 or should I add in another?

! DMDX 3.0.4.8
! Dell Latitude
! Refresh rate = 16.59
! Max Prep A time for this range of wav length < 133 ms so <d 30> seems 
ample, if I understood correctly.
! DQ adjusted by 31, 61, 91 ticks for wavs of 500, 1000, and 1500 ms, 
respectively.
! I believe that the <fd> parameter is a default; so it was redundant under 
these circumstances and I removed it - correct?
