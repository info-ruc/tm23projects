Dear all,

I realised that the script I sent wasn't very helpful.  Here's the problem 
in words.

I have an rt file in which i ask for a series of special characters from 
Arial Unicode to be presented instead of normal fonts.  They show up in 
word and in wordpad, but then many of them become ???? in the task 
itself.  The character set is there to be drawn upon, but for some reason 
DMDX can't do it.

Does anybody have any clues as to how to fix this?  This will save me many 
hours, as one alternative is to make them into image files and call them up 
in this form.  I'm having trouble making the timing work with a test run of 
this anyway.

Virginia Holmes
