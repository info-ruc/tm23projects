Hello,

I have subscribed to the COE mailing list, but I have not been able to =
find the correct e-mail adress for the list. Could perhaps somebody =
indicate that to me?

So, although this might be the wrong place, I will try my luck anyway. I =
have installed CMapTools v4.01 with COE on a German Windows XP. Although =
there is a warning that there are some issues in the Debug list with =
non-English OS, the program starts ok, and the CMapTools work. However, =
when I click on the Semantic Web Templates icon, the Semantic Web =
templates area is empty (I have not found any "templates" folder =
either). Where are these templates, how can I make use of them?

Also, on the File menu, New Ontology is grayed out.

Is there anything I still have to do to get the Semantic Web Templates =
and the New Ontology going on COE?

Thanks for help,
David
