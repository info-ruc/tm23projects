Hi,

I've received several emails in the last few months asking how to =20
export a Cmap as an image so that it will look good when importing =20
into a document and/or presentation. The issue comes up mainly when =20
importing into Word, where the Cmaps look fuzzy when printing. In =20
contrast, printing directly from CmapTools produced a much better =20
quality image.

Here are some tips on how to get better quality exported images.

When exporting an image from CmapTools to be imported in a Word =20
document, on the dialogue box that comes up click on the "Options" =20
button. A new dialogue box comes up that gives you the option to set =20
the Image Scale and Quality.

The Image Scale at 100% refers to 100% of the screen resolution, =20
which is not very good (72 dpi) and so the exported image, if this =20
setting is left unchanged, is a low quality image. Change this =20
setting to 300% to get 210 dpi, close to the 200 dpi used for images =20
in publications. (When printing directly from CmapTools, the software =20=

gets the resolution from the printer and so the image is scaled =20
accordingly, that is why the resulting printout with the default =20
settings is of better quality).

The Quality setting can stay at 90% (default) or better change it to =20
100%.

The exported image will be much larger than needed, but when rescaled =20=

when imported into Word should produce a good quality image for =20
printing.

Hope this helps,

Alberto
