Hi all

A few people asked if there was any information they could give to their students about the strike, it is at:
<http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1528>

Below is a letter from Sally Hunt with details of what action short of a strike consists of.  This dispute is really crucial, so please support it to the full.

Also we need more volunteers for the picket line, I think, so if people could email m.j.carley@bath.ac.uk with their availability that would be great.  I did it last time, it was great fun!  Go on, you know you want to...

Subject: Urgent message to AUT members from Sally Hunt, AUT general secretary

Dear colleague,

Most of you will know by now that the union is asking you to take strike
action on Tuesday 7 March, and to begin action short of a strike on
Wednesday 8 March.  This instruction applies to members who are covered by
the notice here: http://www.aut.org.uk/payaction
I sincerely wish that we did not have to take this action to secure better
pay. The employers have been saying for years that they would like to pay
you more if only funding was higher.  Yet, now that there is more money
they are refusing to make you any offer at all.
I know that many individual vice chancellors are unhappy with the public
stance of the national employers.  They tell me that they recognise the
need to invest in staff and want UCEA to make a good offer. I hope they now
get off the fence and tell UCEA to start negotiating before this damaging
dispute deepens.
Following the overwhelming vote by you to support industrial action the
employers have, at last, agreed to further talks but not for another month!
They also say that they may be able to make an offer shortly after that.
This is progress of sorts after four months of procrastination but I have
told the employers today that we need talks NOW not in a month's time, and
that they need to finally come up with a pay offer that reflects your
worth.  See our press release here:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1546
The employers also need to focus more on resolving the dispute, and less on
seeking to intimidate hard working academic and related staff members.  I
have heard from many members for example that the employers are now telling
staff that if they die when they are on strike their next of kin will not
receive some pension benefits.  Hardly an indication of the value they
place on long serving staff is it? Whatever tactics the employers try, you
will have the full support of your union.
My message to you is a simple one.  How well we do at the negotiating table
will depend on how strongly you support the action and in particular the
boycott of assessment.  I know this will be difficult, and that you will
come under severe pressure but we have to make the boycott effective if we
are to deliver better pay.
Incidentally, I wish to reiterate that you should not mark or set assessed
or examined work.  Our legal advice is that if you do mark scripts and then
withhold them, then they become the property of the university and you may
be asked to surrender them thereby undermining the industrial action.
Please follow the guidelines set out at
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1523 in order to protect both
yourself and the union’s position.
Please also get involved in this campaign. Help your local association by
lending a hand with picketing, handing out leaflets and speaking to your
students.
Support your union.  Your future pay and pension will depend on it.

Thank you for taking the time to read this letter.

Sally Hunt
AUT general secretary
