Hi all,

I am investigating the usage of cmaptools for our IT management department 
as we need to consolidate our knowledge and insight into 1 shared system 
for better distribution.  My main unclarity at the moment is the approach 
to take in defining the levels of information:  e.g. documenting an 
interface can be done on different levels of depth, depending on the 
audience.  I need my cmaps to be readable by both novice and expert users 
and would like to build a 'layered' knowledge model.

On the technical cmaptools-level, I have no issues (yet).  I can build the 
layered structure etc. but can anyone show me examples or approaches on 
how to define the layers? Does anyone have a "best practice" on the 
matter?  Any documentation, url's, ... available for me to check and 
learn?

I appreciate the feedback!

cheers,
Erwin Vervacke
