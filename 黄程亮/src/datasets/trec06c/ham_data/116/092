   Display them in a frame that has the longest duration desired and with a 
an appropriate <Delay> parameter (it'll have to be big to allow for reading 
the wave files) you'll have a constant start to start time.

   So you'll have to look in the diagnostics.txt file generated after this 
file has run and see how long the Preparation times are and pick a delay 
parameter that's suitably longer, say 30 ticks if it's never taking close 
to 500ms.  Then you'll want to fix the duration of the frames with the 
remainder of 125 ticks (less one for the blank frame at the end of the item).
