Hello,

thanks Tom for the reply on the CMapTools mailing list. I have tried the =
steps on the COEStartup.htm (I overlooked that file somehow, sorry), and =
got the templates going, but the procedure was a little bit different.

First, the primary view is not as the one depicted in the above =
htm-file: it is the same as on the CmapTools, i.e. the left hand tabs =
read "Cmaps in My Computer" and "Share CMaps in Places" instead of =
"Ontologies in My Cmputer" and "Shared Ontologies in Places" (by the =
way, I have checked the version number on the startup screen, it reads =
correctly "Version 4.01 COE"). Also, when trying to set up the Place =
Preferences, there is no edit box for "places that belong to" (instead, =
there is a fixed text: "places that belong to the "cmapdp.public" =
group).

Anyway, adding the place IHMC Public Ontologies (in the "Shared CMaps =
..." tab with the "Add Place") did the trick, and the templates are =
there now as described in the Overview.pdf.

I was just wondering about these differences; are they due just to the =
new version 4.01, or am I still missing something?

Best thanks again for the quick help, eager to get into Ontology =
building,
David
