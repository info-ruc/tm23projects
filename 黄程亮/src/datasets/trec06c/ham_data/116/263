Yeah, your file is using an RTF control word DMDX doesn't know, \u.  I'll 
see if I can't decipher how to use it but given that it looks like a 
unicode specific control word and DMDX is most specifically not a unicode 
aware application and any support it does have for it is strictly smoke and 
mirrors that Microsoft has built into the OS I don't hold much hope of 
getting it to work any time soon.  That and I'm pretty busy for the next 
day or two...
