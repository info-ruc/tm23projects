Following the adoption of the Minho university=20
policy on open access, according to the second=20
paragraph of that policy, in 2005 the Rector=20
established a financial supplement for=20
departments and research centers, as a reward for=20
their implementation of the policy, and=20
established criteria for awarding the financial supplement.

The financial supplement was devised as a way to=20
reinforce the self-archiving mandate. The reward=20
was distributed through the research=20
centers/departments, and not directly to the individual researchers.

To stimulate the early adoption of the=20
self-archiving practice, the reward was=20
distributed according to the number of documents=20
archived in three phases: 42 % of the reward=20
according with the number of self-archived=20
documents till April 2005, 33% according with the=20
number of documents archived between May and=20
August, 25% according with the number of=20
documents archived from September to December.

In each of the phases, the total amount that each=20
research center/department received was calculated as a function of:

1 =96 Type of documents self-archived=20
(peer-reviewed journal articles =3D 1;=20
peer-reviewed/accepted conference papers  =3D 0,5; other documents =3D 0,1);

2 =96 Date of publication (2004 and 2005 =3D 1; previous to 2004 =3D 0,3);

3 =96 Research Center/Department self-archiving=20
policy. Departments that adopted a self-archiving=20
policy based in the model of university policy=20
(basically, self-archive and make available OA=20
whenever is possible, restrict access or add only=20
metadata if needed, and consider the IR as the=20
official registry of the research output, from=20
where all the lists should be extracted) =3D 1;=20
Departments without that policy =3D 0,3.

The results of this policy was that, from January=20
1 to December 31 2005, 2.813 documents were=20
deposited in our IR: nearly 41% and 40% were,=20
respectively, journal articles and conference=20
papers, and more than 19% were other type of=20
documents (book chapters, books, working papers, etc.) .
