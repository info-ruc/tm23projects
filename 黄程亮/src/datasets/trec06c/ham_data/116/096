Jonathan,

I tried running DMDX on safemode, but the machine still misbehaves.
Here's what seems to be the relevant portion item file:

<ep> <fd 1> <nfb> <SafeMode 1> <VideoMode 1024,768,768,16,60> <id
PIO12> <ro 1, 0> <cr> <dbc 180180180> <eop>
10101 <o 1> <jpg> "img0018"/ <jpg> "grey2" <% 4>/ <% 30>/ <o 1> <jpg>
"img0025"/ <jpg> "grey2" <% 4>/ <% 30>/<o 1> <jpg> "img0030"/ <jpg>
"grey2" <% 4>/ <% 30>/ <o 1> <jpg> "img0038"/ <jpg> "grey2" <% 4>/;

Appreciate the help,

Rich
