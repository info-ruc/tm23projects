To all students and faculty:
The deadline for submission of abstracts for the 2006 Sigma Xi Student
Research Symposium Poster Competition has been extended to March 20th at
5:00 P.M.
Sigma Xi, the Scientific Honor Society, is hosting its annual Student
Research Symposium Poster Competition and Awards Ceremony on April 4th.
This symposium represents an opportunity for all students to present their
scientific achievements, and to participate in the diverse research
community that is the Ole Miss chapter of Sigma Xi. The posters will be
presented between 1:30 and 3:30 pm in the Yerby Auditorium, and I urge
everyone to participate in this event and/or come out to see the breadth
of science, and the excellence of our students, at Ole Miss. 
An awards ceremony for "best of" categories, including a best poster by an
undergraduate offered by the Sally McDonnell Barksdale Honors College,
will follow the poster competition. The awards ceremony will be open to
all presenters and their faculty advisors, and will take place from 6-8:30
pm in the Brandt Memory House. 

We strongly encourage all graduate and undergraduate students to
participate in this event. Abstracts will be due on March 20. This year,
only one presentation per student will be accepted. Please visit our
website for submission guidelines and further
information:

We look forward to seeing you there!
