Hi Rodney, Epifanio, everyone
in WWMAPS support pages
http://www.2wmaps.com/public/base_cmaptools.htm#Videoclisp_eng
we are publishing a similar collection of videos (six of ten ready by now)
These are only the basics to asynchronous collaboration with CmapTools,
because the synchronous one is still uncommon in our collaboration project.
These videos are made with "captivate" in italian, spanish and english, but
they have no audio.
A member of our community from Lima was interested to collaborate among his
and other students of medicine from other countries, sharing concept maps. =
I
could try to re-contact him if you are interested, or help you to find othe=
r
potential partners for such collaboration.

regards

Alfredo
