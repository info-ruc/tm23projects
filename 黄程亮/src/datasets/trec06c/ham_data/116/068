Jonathan,

I have two sample item files I am running, one with PIO12 outputs and
one without them. When I run the item file without the outputs, DMDX
runs fine and terminates normally (although I have to run the script
twice, one time fails, the next works). When I run the item file with
the outputs, DMDX will run the file through to the end, but then stops
responding. At that point, I have to execute the control+alt=delete
command to free up the machine. Any ideas? Thanks,

Rich
