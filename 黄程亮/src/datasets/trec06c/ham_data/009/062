I am looking for BinHex 4.0 mail decoding program too. However, all
references that I could find on Internet are for Unix and Mac users
only. So what am I to do if I'm using Windows 95  and just received
an e-mail  that starts with  a line  that looks like that "Must  be
converted through BinHex 4.0". Thank you in advance.
