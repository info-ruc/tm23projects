This is, what I've found in the tech-notes:

character-set
         This sets the character set used by the terminal. Currently
     appropriate values are US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 through ISO-8859-9 and
     ISO-2022-JP. See the section on international character sets for more
     details. The default is US-ASCII.

Since US-ASCII is a subset of ISO-88590-1 (is it?), you should have no
troubles in setting the variable 

s(etup) c(onfig) ctrl-w(here-is) "character-set" enter 
[?(help) ... enjoy ... e(xit)]
c(hange) "ISO-8895-1" enter e(xit) y(es)

Provided your terminal is able to display the character set, you're
done.  

hth, norbert.
