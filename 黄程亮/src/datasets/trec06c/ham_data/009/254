Hi Scott (& everyone),

Yes, two days ago the LEGO company officially launched "LEGO
Mindstorms," which is a new brand and product line inspired by the MIT
Programmable Brick research.

Scott -- thanks for noticing, and digging up the URL
<http://www.legomindstorms.com/>.

I am very excited about LEGO's deep commitment to the educational and
entertainment value of kids building their own robots.  The LEGO
Mindstorms brand, and its flagship "RCX" programmable brick, is a
breakthrough in bringing these ideas into the home.

Fred
