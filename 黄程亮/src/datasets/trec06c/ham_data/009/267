LittleFuse makes an identical replacement for the PolyFuse one.  Don't =
have a name of a distributor on hand except for Sterling Electronics.  =
Do a web search on LittleFuse and you should be able to get something.  =
Hope this helps.

I'm no authority, but you might get away with a 3 amp fuse in a pinch.
However, the Polyswitch fuse is actually a PTC Thermistor designed to =
work
as a sort of solid state circuit breaker.  These have a variety of =
names;
look for "PTC fuse", "PTC current limiter", PTC resettable", or the =
like,
listed either under "fuse" or "thermistor".  You need one which will =
carry=20
a
current of 2.5 amps, but will shut off at a maximum of 5 amps, with a =
0.2
inch lead spacing.

I know of no reason why you cannot substitute for the ZTX614.
