Hi Fred

There was a short article on the news last night about a new Lego robotics
product that looked alot like the "lego intelligent brick" concept you were
working on last year...

A bit of searching revealed the site http://www.legomindstorms.com/ which
mentions the MIT Media Lab.

Is this the project that grew out of the HandyBoard (or was it the other way
around) ?

Scott
