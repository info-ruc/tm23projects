if you mean you want them saved automatically, then listen to what robin
said about procmail 

if you want to save them by hand (ie. read one and then save it to
whichever folder you feel is pertanent) then while reading the message
type <s> <the name of the folder> <enter>

the foldernames are case sensitive
