Hello ,
     I've subscribed to this list for about 2 months now and I have
learned quite a bit from it and am grateful for your technical
expertise.
     I would, however, like to voice a pet peeve.
     When you include the original message in your posts, would you
please put it after your message?  I am blind and use speech for
access and having the quote first is time consuming and a bit
annoying.
     If I am reading your post, I am usually familiar with the
thread and can silence my machine and go on to another post.
     I realize this takes some extra work, but it would help insure
your posts are read and make the time on the Internet more
productive for those of us using access devices.
     Thank you,
     Margaret
