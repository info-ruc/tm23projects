Hmmm.  Okay.  I'm also looking into the sendmail end of things, to see if
I can correct the problem after Pine sends it but before it leaves the
machine.

Anyway, any guesses on what may be causing my re-compile problem?  I don't
mind going in and making some changes if I have to, but I don't want to
start
blidly groping through code I've never looked at before.  The only error
message I get is "cc internal compiler error" and "received signal 6".  Is
this a known problem with either my libc or gcc verions?  (5.4.33 and
2.7.2.2
respectively.)

I'll also take a look at qmail.  Personally my mailer of choice was emacs
at work until someone decided that Lotus Notes for Solaris looked pretty
neat.  *ack hack hack*  Tragically this person seemed to be a policy
maker.

Believe me, you have my sincerest sympathies.  :)
