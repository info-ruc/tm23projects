Can you please help me in my quest for answers ? All of my E-mail has what
looks like typos scattered though out each message, sometimes a couple of
words will be repeated.
I have yet to find anyone including the servers people who can explain
what is wrong.
I am using MS DOS and Pine 3.95, no problems with reception and the DOS
does fine, I have WINDOWS 3.11 but as yet have not mastered any of this so
I stay with DOS until I can find someone to help me with it.
The phone company tells me that the line from the central office is clean
so I am not sure what the next move is.
Thankyou for any advice you can give to resolve this problem.
No one else has this typo problem. Computer illiterate, yes I admit it.
Best Regards, fae@diamond.sunset.net
