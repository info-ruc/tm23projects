The target for the final observations of this filament campaign
are to continue observing the filament observed on the 22nd and 23rd.
The VLA will be targeting two segments which will be located
at S07W61 and S23W42 at 19:00 UT on Jan. 26, 1997. Since at the
highest frequencies, the VLA cannot see both at once, it will
alternate pointing each minute.  The SOONSPOT observatories
will continuously target the segment at S07W61 and that should
be the target of observatories with limited fields of view.
VLA observations will occur from 15:47-21:47 UT on Jan.26.

Thank you for your cooperation.  The campaign leader of these
observations, Dr. Gopalswamy, would like to hear about
collaborative observations that have been obtained.
