Subject: SPI routine for EEPROM, corrected web link
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Some of you have had problems loading the app note. We found out a little late
that Netscape doesn't like directory names that have a space in it. This has 
now been corrected.

Application note on hooking up a EEPROM to the Finger Board SPI port.
EAS-AN001
This also applies to the Handy Board SPI port. Very useful for datalogging
and 
data table lookups without having to use up core memory.
