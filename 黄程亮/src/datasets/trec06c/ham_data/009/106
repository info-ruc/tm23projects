Does anyone have a procmail formula that will allow flags to be set for
pine?  I'd like to flag certain messages as important in pine for mailing
lists.  In my case I'm going to be doing it based on the From address.

[I know this isn't purely a pine question, but it isn't purely a procmail
question either.]
