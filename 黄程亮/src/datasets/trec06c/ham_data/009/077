Robin,
Few can dispute the fact that this place is increasingly inhabited by
morons. Your puzzlement is noted, but your exquisite command of the
English language is not called into question.
I think this falls into the category of "RTFPM" (Read the fearsome printer
manual) and also learn the lingua franca of the Internet....ENGLISH!!!
(and I freely confess that it's not an ideal standard) Let's face it,
Gerald is linguistically challenged, and has little interest in the
printed material which was supplied to him (in his own language, no less)
which would cause him to be able to operate his machinery!
Auf Wiedersehn Mein Freund!
-Colin.
