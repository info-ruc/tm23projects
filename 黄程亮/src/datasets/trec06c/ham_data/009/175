Does anyone have a good source for getting the E2 chip and other parts that
are used to build the handyboard and miniboard. In my search for a good
price on the E2 I found that Newark has the chip for $27.00. Newark also
has many of the other parts like the TI motor chips. I have found the
Arrrow has the E2 for $7.84. Arrow also sells the TI chip and the L293D.
The problem with them was they a  $25 minimum per line item. Arrow has just
about everything that I had a hard time finding except for the ds1233-10.

Thanks
