From The Office Of Mr.Dale Samson


Organization For Petroleum Exporting Countries - OPEC.



Plot #123cbB/Pbv, main city 


Sao Tome and principle of West Africa. 


Dear Sir/Madam 


I want you to patiently read this offer. I am Mr.abdul

mohammad, the 


Head of Delegation to the World Bank in West Africa. I

am the linkman 


between the Organization For Petroleum Exporting

Countries - OPEC and the 


petroleum sector in a West African country. I also

attend OPEC meetings 


constantly in Geneva on the auspices of World Bank. 


Through the sale of our allocated oil quota in OPEC, I

was able to make 


US$20Million, which is currently deposited in a

Security company in 


Europe. I want you to assist me to claim this money as

I cannotclaim it 


directly because I am still a civil servant, and the

code ofconduct bureau 


forbids me to acquire such amount of money. It is on

this basis that I am 


contacting you for assistance, if you will be

interested; claim documents 


have been processed and will be sent to you. The

documents with which the 


fund is deposited will be changed to reflect you as

the new beneficiary so 


that you will be eligible to collect the fund on my

behalf. 


I will give you 25% of the fund for this assistance

while 65% will be 


for me and 10% will be for expenses that may be

incurred on both sides. I am 


aware of the international monitoring of all

large-scale financialmovements 


after the September 11th 2001 terrorist attack on

America ad to avoid any 


state of financial investigation I will provide a

classified clearance paper 


from the relevant body, which will exonerate the money

from drug, money 


laundered or terrorist related proceed. 


I want to assure you that there is no risk attached in

this 


transaction. You should also provide me with your

private telephone and fax 


numbers for easier communication. 


I await your prompt response. 


Best regards,


Mr Dale Samson
