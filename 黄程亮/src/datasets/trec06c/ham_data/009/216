Not sure it's the best way, but you should be able to use the string of 
commands ";" "a" "a" "s" etc to save all messages in a read only folder to
another folder which will be a read and write folder. YOu may then delete
the original folder and then rename the new folder to the old name if you
wish. This worked for me in PC-Pine - I assume it will work in a Unix
Pine. 

Or a really hard way (it's been a long time and I don't really remember
correctly perhaps) is to open the folder file from outside Pine with Pico
or some other editor like vi and (globally) change the "Status:" argument
of EACH message to contain nothing (it will typically read "Status:RO").

Are there other ways (anybody)?
