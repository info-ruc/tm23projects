While composing a message, put the cursor in the headers and hit ^j and enter
the filename. It's that simple. You are, of course, positive, that the
receipient can read Word, right?

With respect to "unharmed", there's nothing pine can do about that. pine
doesn't handle mail transport. Each of the machines along the path to the final
machine must be properly configured to handle MIME attachments. All you can do
is hope for the best.
