Hello all,

I would like to be able to 'drive' my robot using the Handy Board via a radio 
link. For this purpose I have bought two transceivers, the Radiometrix BiM 418 
F.

How can I connect it to my Handy Board? The wiring is as follows (leaving out 
+5V and Ground):


Aerial

|     ________ Tx select
|    |
_____/|_______ Tx data
  |  \|
  |
  |    _______ Rx select
  |   |
  |__|\_______ Rx data
     |/
      |_______ Carrier detect


Which pins of the RJ11 connector, digital inputs and SPI do I need for this?

I'm not very good at electronics, so any help would be very much appreciated. 
Thanks in advance.

Greetings,
Jan Sipke van der Veen
