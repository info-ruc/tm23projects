Dear Amit, 

I'm going to London for a month, which is why I'm in a fairly good
mood... otherwise my answer would have been a bit shorter and would
have contained language unsuitable for children, because your question
is a VFAQ. }:->

The answer to your question is in the Pine FAQ, which can be found on
the Pine website, and should also be on your system. You will find a
pointer to Nancy McGough's filtering mail FAQ, which is a brilliant
document and will answer all your questions. The short answer is "man
procmail", "man procmailex".

Cheers,
Robin
