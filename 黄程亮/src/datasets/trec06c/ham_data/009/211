All,

I know this cannot be a new question, but I couldn't find it in the FAQ,
manpages, tech-notes or mailing list archive.  Here is my situation.

I have an account on a POP3 server, mailserv.nbnet.nb.ca.  The account name
is fade.  I'm trying to read my mail on my LINUX box locally and I want to
use Pine to do it.  The account I almost always log on as root to my
machine
(which has no domain name and no static IP, damned ppp connection.)

First off, can I do this?  On the assumption that I can, here is what I
have
tried.

I downloaded a POP3 client called getpop3.  All it does is open a
connection
to the server, sends it the username, password and the dynamic IP I have
been
assigned.  The server creates an SMTP connection (port 25) and sends the
mail.  Everything is fine that way.  I can read my mail okay.

Now, when I choose to reply (or send new mail) I can compose it and send it
without a hitch, but the message that the recipient gets is 'From'
root@nbnet.nb.ca, not fade@nbnet.nb.ca.  This is kind of interesting from
a security point of view, but pretty annoying for just simple
correspondance.

The only solutions I have come up with are:

1) Create an account 'fade' on my local machine for the purpose of reading
email.  This is what I've done and if that is the best I can do I'll live
with it.

2) Recompile Pine to allow setting the "From: " line in the custom headers.
I tried this last night and ran into a bigger can of worms.  While
compiling
mailindx.c the compiler received signal 6, internal compiler error it said.
If it helps, I'm using gcc 2.7.2.2 with libc 5.4.33.  Oh, and the Pine I'm
compiling is 3.96.

Personally, I'm hoping that there is some magical third option I haven't
seen.  Anybody have any suggestions?

Thanks.

Joe M.
