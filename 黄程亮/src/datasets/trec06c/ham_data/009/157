Hmm, READONLY is exactly what we would think of: you have only read
permission on your inbox file. This is why messages aren't
transferred, as I understand it, because this includes, afaik, a
delete operation on the inbox file.

Inbox is set READONLY by pine, if another process is locking the
file. Therefore, look whether another pine process (or any other mua
pointing to the same file) is still running (task manager ...) or
check lock files that might have been left because of an unwanted
(:-)) exit from pine.

And then, I don't know much about WinNT and it's early in the morning,
ie my answer might be a complete mess.

l8er, norbert.
