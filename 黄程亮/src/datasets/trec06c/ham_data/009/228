Yes, there is a limit, but it will vary depending on the path the mail
takes on its way from your friend to you.  Each mail transport agent (MTA)
along the path can impose a size limit per mail message processed. If the
mail from your friend is larger than that limit for any MTA in the path,
that MTA will reject the message.
