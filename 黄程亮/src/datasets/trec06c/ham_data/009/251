I realized I had two typos in my e-mail that listed the file name.  I had
the spelling correct when trying access the download.  I am trying to
access http://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine/pcp_w32.zip file and am
receiving the message "Internet explorer cannot access
http://ftp.cac.washington.edu/pine/pcpine/pcp_w32.zip."
