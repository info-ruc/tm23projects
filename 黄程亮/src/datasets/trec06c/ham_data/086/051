Kelley and other Linuxers.,

Forget about the Linux version supported by the CFHT. In fact, this version which is extremely compact was developped for laptop computers but it is not very handy for normal users. It is called Sidius.

In Europe, a lot of people use Mandrake Linux which is supposely more reliable and secure than Red Hat and easier to install. Mandrake is developped by a small company  which has an office in Pasadena. see http://www.mandrakelinux.com/en/
I did not find information about the support they provided.  Ypou may have a look on the web page

Cheers
Franck M.
