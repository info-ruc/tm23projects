Dear Jonathan

	I'm trying to make a file with zillion responses.  I'm having great 
problems, and I promise I've tried very hard to test many 
alternatives.  One preliminary problem is that DM is telling me when the 
subject has stopped pressing the button as well as the onset time.  How do 
I suppress that?

	The main question is this.  Each trial has two parts, and I've tried to do 
each trial as one as well as to split it into two.  the subject has to give 
a binary decision first on an image, and then type the image's name.

	I attach my embarassingly incorrect file for your perusal.  At the moment, 
I've got an item presenting the image and then a second grouped item asking 
"mot?" for the name.  I don't care here if there are no times at all, I 
just want to know what name the subject wants to give the image.  My file 
at present has a clock on indicator in the second part, because leaving it 
out didn't seem to work at all.

	 When I test out what I've done I can't get the image to go away when I 
respond.

	HELP!!!!
