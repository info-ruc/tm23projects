Certainly there are some machines that just plain can't handle DMDX and 
they're usually old machines. However that message means you need to 
time that video mode, if it was timed in the past then something has 
damaged the registry. Perhaps the hard disk is failing and you need to 
check it's integrity. Perhaps you just need to reformat it and install 
98 from scratch and see if it gets better.

----------------------------
How should I approach this problem if, Windows 98 and the hard drive 
have been cleared of the problem?  We have also attempted uninstall and 
reinstall DMDX.  Thank you.
