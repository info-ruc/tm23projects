CERT Advisory CA-2003-05 Multiple Vulnerabilities in Oracle Servers

   Original release date: February 19, 2003
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running Oracle9i Database (Release 1 and 2)
     * Systems running Oracle8i Database v 8.1.7
     * Systems running Oracle8 Database v 8.0.6
     * Systems  running  Oracle9i  Application  Server (Release 9.0.2 and 9.0.3)

Overview

   Multiple  vulnerabilities  exist  in  Oracle software that may lead to
   execution  of  arbitrary  code; the ability to read, modify, or delete
   information  stored  in  underlying  Oracle  databases;  or  denial of
   service.   All   of  these  vulnerabilites  were  discovered  by  Next
   Generation Security Software Ltd.

I. Description

   Multiple   vulnerabilities   exist  in  Oracle9i  Application  Server,
   Oracle9i  Database,  and  Oracle8i  Database.  The  majority  of these
   vulnerabilities are buffer overflows.

   Oracle has published Security Alerts describing these vulnerabilities.
   If you use Oracle products listed in the "Systems Affected" section of
   this  document,  we  strongly  encourage  you  to review the following
   Oracle Security Alerts and apply patches as appropriate:

     * Buffer Overflow in DIRECTORY parameter of Oracle9i Database Server
       http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2003alert48.pdf

     * Buffer Overflow in TZ_OFFSET function of Oracle9i Database Server
       http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2003alert49.pdf

     * Buffer  Overflow  in TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ function of Oracle9i Database Server
       http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2003alert50.pdf

     * Buffer Overflow in ORACLE.EXE binary of Oracle9i Database Server
       http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2003alert51.pdf

     * Two Vulnerabilities in Oracle9i Application Server
       http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/2003alert52.pdf

   NGSSoftware  Insight  Security  Research  Advisories  describing these
   issues are listed below:

     * Oracle9i Application Server Format String Vulnerability
       http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/ora-appservfmtst.txt

     * Oracle TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ Remote System Buffer Overrun
       http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/ora-tmstmpbo.txt

     * ORACLE bfilename function buffer overflow vulnerability
       http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/ora-bfilebo.txt

     * Oracle TZ_OFFSET Remote System Buffer Overrun
       http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/ora-tzofstbo.txt

     * Oracle unauthenticated remote system compromise
       http://www.nextgenss.com/advisories/ora-unauthrm.txt

   The CERT/CC has published vulnerability notes for each of these issues
   as  well. The vulnerability in Oracle's mod_dav module (VU#849993) has
   been as assigned CVE ID CAN-2002-0842.

II. Impact

   Depending  on  the  vulnerability  being exploited, an attacker may be
   able  to  execute  arbitrary code; read, modify, or delete information
   stored  in  underlying Oracle databases; or cause a denial of service.
   The vulnerabilities in "ORACLE.EXE" (VU#953746) and the WebDAV modules
   (VU#849993, VU#511194) may be exploited prior to authentication.

III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Solutions  for  specific  vulnerabilities  can  be  found in the above
   referenced   Oracle  Security  Alerts,  NGSSoftware  Insight  Security
   Research Advisories, and individual CERT/CC Vulnerability Notes.

Mitigation Strategies

   Until  a  patch can be applied, the CERT/CC recommends that vulnerable
   sites

     * disable unnecessary Oracle services
     * run Oracle services with the least privilege
     * restrict network access to Oracle services
