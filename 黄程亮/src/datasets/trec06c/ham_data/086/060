Hi all.

I was wondering if anyone has encountered and figured out the solution to
the below problem.

Im running an experiment where the subject has to respond at the end of each
trail; they have to say "same" or "different". I've two versions of the
experiment. The first version (A) works fine and recordvocal records what
the subject says without any problems. The second version (B), which has
identical settings as the first however only records the 's' of same and the
'di' of different. To prevent the possibility of the wav file in (B) from
activating digitalvox, all heard stimuli are presented through headphones
(the wav file is 3 seconds long). I have a soundblaster live in the computer
and am wondering whether it could be a hardware problem with the sound card
and windows xp that im running the latest version of DMDX on. It could be
something to do with the soundcard playing a wav file and being expected to
record a response at the same time (only script B). I've tried altering the
order of <id “keyboard”> <id “RecordVocal” 1000> and have tried adding <id
“RecordVocal” 0, 1000> as suggesting in one of the emails on the user list
server but neither have had an effect.

Cheers for any help, Andy.
