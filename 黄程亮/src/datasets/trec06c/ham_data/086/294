CERT Advisory CA-2003-07 Remote Buffer Overflow in Sendmail

   Original release date: March 3, 2003
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Sendmail Pro (all versions)
     * Sendmail Switch 2.1 prior to 2.1.5
     * Sendmail Switch 2.2 prior to 2.2.5
     * Sendmail Switch 3.0 prior to 3.0.3
     * Sendmail for NT 2.X prior to 2.6.2
     * Sendmail for NT 3.0 prior to 3.0.3
     * Systems  running  open-source  sendmail  versions prior to 8.12.8,
       including UNIX and Linux systems

Overview

   There  is  a vulnerability in sendmail that may allow remote attackers
   to gain the privileges of the sendmail daemon, typically root.

I. Description

   Researchers  at  Internet  Security  Systems  (ISS)  have discovered a
   remotely  exploitable  vulnerability  in  sendmail. This vulnerability
   could  allow  an  intruder  to  gain  control of a vulnerable sendmail
   server.

   Most  organizations  have  a variety of mail transfer agents (MTAs) at
   various  locations  within their network, with at least one exposed to
   the   Internet.   Since   sendmail  is  the  most  popular  MTA,  most
   medium-sized  to  large  organizations are likely to have at least one
   vulnerable   sendmail   server.  In  addition,  many  UNIX  and  Linux
   workstations  provide  a  sendmail  implementation that is enabled and
   running by default.

   This    vulnerability    is    message-oriented    as    opposed    to
   connection-oriented. That means that the vulnerability is triggered by
   the  contents  of  a  specially-crafted  email  message rather than by
   lower-level  network  traffic.  This  is important because an MTA that
   does  not  contain  the  vulnerability will pass the malicious message
   along  to  other  MTAs  that may be protected at the network level. In
   other  words, vulnerable sendmail servers on the interior of a network
   are  still  at risk, even if the site's border MTA uses software other
   than sendmail. Also, messages capable of exploiting this vulnerability
   may pass undetected through many common packet filters or firewalls.

   Sendmail has indicated to the CERT/CC that this vulnerability has been
   successfully  exploited in a laboratory environment. We do not believe
   that   this   exploit  is  available  to  the  public.  However,  this
   vulnerability  is  likely  to  draw  significant  attention  from  the
   intruder community, so the probability of a public exploit is high.

   A  successful  attack  against  an  unpatched sendmail system will not
   leave any messages in the system log. However, on a patched system, an
   attempt  to  exploit  this  vulnerability will leave the following log
   message:

     Dropped invalid comments from header address

   Although  this does not represent conclusive evidence of an attack, it
   may be useful as an indicator.

   A  patched  sendmail server will drop invalid headers, thus preventing
   downstream servers from receiving them.

   The CERT/CC is tracking this issue as VU#398025. This reference number
   corresponds to CVE candidate CAN-2002-1337.

       http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/398025

II. Impact

   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to
   gain  the  privileges  of  the  sendmail  daemon, typically root. Even
   vulnerable  sendmail servers on the interior of a given network may be
   at  risk  since  the vulnerability is triggered from the contents of a
   malicious email message.

III. Solution

Apply a patch from Sendmail

   Sendmail  has produced patches for versions 8.9, 8.10, 8.11, and 8.12.
   However,  the  vulnerability  also  exists  in earlier versions of the
   code;  therefore,  site  administrators  using  an earlier version are
   encouraged to upgrade to 8.12.8. These patches are located at

       ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.12.security.cr.patch
       ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.11.6.security.cr.patch
       ftp://ftp.sendmail.org/pub/sendmail/sendmail.8.9.3.security.cr.patch

Apply a patch from your vendor

   Many  vendors  include  vulnerable  sendmail  servers as part of their
   software distributions. We have notified vendors of this vulnerability
   and  recorded  their  responses  in  the  systems  affected section of
   VU#398025.  Several  vendors  have  provided  a  statement  for direct
   inclusion in this advisory; these statements are available in Appendix
   A.

Enable the RunAsUser option

   There is no known workaround for this vulnerability. Until a patch can
   be  applied,  you  may  wish to set the RunAsUser option to reduce the
   impact  of this vulnerability. As a good general practice, the CERT/CC
   recommends  limiting  the  privileges  of  an  application  or service
   whenever possible.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
   comments.

Apple Computer, Inc.

   Security  Update  2003-03-03  is available to fix this issue. Packages
   are  available  for  Mac OS X 10.1.5 and Mac OS X 10.2.4. It should be
   noted  that  sendmail  is  not enabled by default on Mac OS X, so only
   those  systems which have explicitly enabled it are susceptible to the
   vulnerability.  All  customers of Mac OS X, however, are encouraged to
   apply this update to their systems.

Avaya, Inc.

   Avaya  is  aware  of the vulnerability and is investigating impact. As
   new information is available this statement will be updated.
