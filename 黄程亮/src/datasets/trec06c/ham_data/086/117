Dear Mr. Foster,
I have a problem with my psichological experiment using DMDX. My
experiment have 4 bloks ok 12 trials, each trial consists of 3 images,
and I have to evaluate the RT of each of these images. My problem is
that in 2 images I want to record the RT by voicekey, but in one image I
need to record the RT by keyboard response, and this is the point that I
don't know how do it.
Actually my experiment (only one trial ) is the next:

<ExtendedParameters>

<AzkiiResponses>
<ContinuousRun>
<InputDevice DigitalVOX>
<InputDevice "teclado">
 <MapPositiveResponse +DigitalVox>
<Timeout 5000>
<DefaultBackgroundColor 0>
<DefaultWritingColor 255255255>
<ClearFeedback>
<VideoMode 800,600,600,8,0>
<EndOfParameters>

+1 <ms% 800><bmp> "imagen1.bmp" / <ms% 500><bmp> "negro.bmp" / * <bmp>
"image1.bmp";  <ms% 2000><bmp> "imagen2.bmp" / <ms% 400><bmp>
+2 "negro.bmp" / <ms% 800><bmp> "español.bmp" / <ms% 500><bmp>
"negro.bmp"  / *<bmp> "ajedrez.bmp";
+3 <ms% 500><bmp> "negro.bmp" / <ms% 800><bmp> "catala.bmp" / <ms%
500><bmp> "negro.bmp" / *<bmp> "ancla.bmp";

I would Know how it has to be made to record the TR of the image1 by
presing the Keyboard (space), while recording of the other 2 images
would be by voicekey. If this isn't possible, I would like to know how
the first image could disappear by preming a key ( I don't care about
the recording of this image ) whithout modificate the other two images.

Thank you for all,
sincerely A. Caño
