PRINCE JENKINS ELEME

Plot 277 Mohtala mohammed way 
Ikeja Lagos.
 
INTRODUCTION: l am PRINCE JENKINE ELEME a Civil servant. l
know this proposal will come to you as a surprise
because we have not met before either physically or
through correspondence. 
I have no doubt in your ability to handle this proposal
involving huge sum of money.  
THE SUBJECT: MY FATHER CHIEF JOHN ELEME(Now Late) was
the Royal Head of my ommunity, ELEME (an oil rich town)
in Nigeria. My community produces 5.8%  of the total
crude oil production in Nigeria and 0.5%  of the Dollar
value of each barrel is paid to my father as royalty by
the Federal Government. My father was also the Chairman
of ELEME Special Oil Trust Fund. 
In his position as the Royal head and Chairman of the
Oil Trust Fund, he made some money which he left for me
as the only thing to inherit. The money is Ten Million
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars($10.5m). This Money
originated from the accumulation  between 1976-1998. 
Due to poor banking system in Nigeria and political
instability as a result of past Military rules
(1985-1999) , he deposited this Money in a  Strong
Room/"VAULTS" with an open beneficiary in Apex Bank of
Nigeria pending when he would finish arrangement to
transfer it abroad as a CONTRACT PAYMENT. He  was
planning this when he died late last year of Heart
Attack. 
 THE PROPOSAL: Just before my father died he  called my
attention to the money and charged me to look for a
foreigner who would assist me in the
transfer/investment of the funds abroad. So l 
would be very grateful if you could accept to help me
archieve this great objective. I promise to give you
20% of the total funds transferred to your vital bank
account as compensation for your assistance. Five
percent (5%)would be set aside to take care of all
expenses we may incure during the transaction. To
indicate your interest, contact me urgently and 
confidentially for more information and the roles you
will play in this business. All the legal information
concerning  this Money will be sent to you as soon as
we agree together. Send your reply through this mail 
box. 
 
May the almighty God bless you. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
PRINCE JENKINS ELEME.
