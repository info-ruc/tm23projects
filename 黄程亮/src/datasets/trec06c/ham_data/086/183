Dear David, 

I appreciate that you didn't have tome to talk on the phone today, and
apologize for interrupting you, but I received a copy of your e-mail and
didn't want it to go unanswered.

I apologize sincerely for the misunderstanding at the poolside cafe, we
certainly do care about our customers and want to serve them in the best
way possible. It was certainly not our intent to upset you or embarrass
you and your students in any way. I cannot apologize enough for the way
in which you were treated. The policy regarding&nbsp; class meetings in
the dining area is an AFC policy not a Dining Services policy. The AFC
considers the dining area their space and have required us to notify
them of class meetings in that space. To request to use that space you
would need to contact Mark Fletcher's office at the AFC as he is in
charge of the building. The way in which this message was delivered to
you was not acceptable and Mark did say that in future his people would
take a less confrontational approach to enforcing their
policy. 

What I would like to suggest to you is that in future you meet at the
Tree House as that space is under our control and we would be pleased to
have your class meet there. The only thing that I would ask is, if
possible, that you let our manager Ernie Raines know that you were
coming.

We do value our customers and do understand our place in the University
community. We want to be of service to you and to your students and hope
that we may help you in the future. Please let me know if there is
anything else I can do to help you provide a positive experience to your
students.

Thank you for your understanding,

Brent Beringer
Director of Dining Services
University of Virginia
