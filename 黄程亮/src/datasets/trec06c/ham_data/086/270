<DIV><FONT face=Arial size=2>I have DMDX installed on a computer running on Windows XP. However, when I try to run an item file, the screen freezes and a message appears stating that the video driver (NVIDIA GeForce2 MX/MX 400) may be the cause of the instability. Does that mean I need to change the driver? If so, would anyone be able to recommend a dual-head driver that runs smoothly with DMDX?</FONT></DIV>
