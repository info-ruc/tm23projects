"If we die, we want people to accept it. We're in a risky business,
and we hope that if anything happens to us it will not delay the
program. The conquest of space is worth the risk of life."
-Gus Grissom, before the first manned Apollo mission.

Subject: [announce@sims] CodeCon 2003


February 22-24 (Sat-Mon) CodeCon 2003 will be happening in San Francisco.
CodeCon (http://codecon.info) is a developer's conference with a strong
emphasis on open software and standards and community-based (as opposed to
commercial) development models.

Talks that may be interesting to members of the SIMS community include:

- Advogato - Good metadata, even when under attack, based on a trust
metric
- HOTorNOT - A working example of well-designed website user interface
- Neurogrid - Decentralized Fuzzy Meta-Data Search
- YouServ - A communal web-hosting system for the masses
- GNU radio - Hacking the RF Spectrum with Free Software and Hardware

They are strongly encouraging participation from non commercial sectors,
such as academia, and offer a student discount rate of $60.  For more
information on CodeCon you can visit http://codecon.info.  To get the
discount registration rate you should email student@codecon.org and ask
for a student "discount code".

Hope to see you all there,

pt.
