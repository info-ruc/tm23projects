   Added a few counter 'constants' to the <set> keyword to facilitate 
running DMDX for limited amounts of time:

ClockOnTime
The millisecond time that the clock was last turned on.  This has two 
possible values depending on whether <RecordClockOnTime> is turned on.  If 
<rcot> is on then loading a counter with clockontime will return the time 
the most recent clock on occurred since the first clock on in the item 
file, otherwise it is since the item file commenced execution.

MillisecTime
The millisecond time when the item is parsed since the item file commenced 
execution.

VideoTime
The current video retrace count when the item is parsed since the item file 
commenced execution.
