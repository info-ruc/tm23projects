I'd like to present different feedback for specific response errors, and I
can't work out how branch/set feedback for the following response errors:

1. more than one key pressed at once/within a certain timeframe
2. response occurred before timing started (e.g. before second stim in a
discrim trial)

It's easy to do late response feedback using <TooLongFeedback>; is it this
easy to do the two above?  Are they possible using branching?

Thanks in advance for any help,
Rua HM.
