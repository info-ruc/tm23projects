Dear Jonathan

	In trying to make the setup subject friendly I took out the continuous run 
option, so that the subject could press the space bar feeling that it was 
to indicate the termination of their spelling, but with the happy 
consequence of bringing on the next picture.  suddenly, however, this see;s 
to have mucked up dm's understanding of the dollar signs to keep what's 
inside in the same order and only scramble the rest.  I put below what I 
have made but taken out the wav indicators so that it shows a word.  if you 
wanted to try it you would only have to put keyboard instead of clavier and 
leave out mr.

	I'm sorry to keep troubling you but there is noone here to ask, and I 
don't think anyone I know has used zil anyway.

	virginia
