Hi Jonathan,

I've already tried adding and taking away quotes from both the key 
definitions and the branch conditions to no avail. I still can't get 
multi-way branching to recognise any conditions other than "branch if 
correct" or "branch if wrong", and yet the interpreter doesn't have any 
problem with the syntax (with or without quotes is fine) - which to me 
suggests that I'm at least formatting the script correctly.

Do you have an example script that uses a "mwb" based on which of several 
keys are pressed? Even a very small fragment that you used in debugging 
would help a lot.

Many thanks for your help with this.

Matt
