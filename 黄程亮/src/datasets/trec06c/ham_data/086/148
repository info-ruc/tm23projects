Electronic Medical Insurance Card

              --- by Dan YI

There are so many insurance companies in US. When a person go to see
doctor,the doctor need to know which insurance plan he has bought and also some
necessary information about that insurance company. There comes the
problem. If the insurance company is very famous, for example,Kaizer,the
doctor don't need to worry about anything. but, what if it's a small
company and doctor has no idea of it before? Then the doctor have to do
lots of search work before he can do anything for the patient. He has to
go to the internet and use google ,or whatever, to search that insurance
company and see how much the plan will cover, which would wastes time.
This kind of thing may happens quite often, specially when a person
travels outsides. Explain the detail of medical insurance to the doctor is
a big trouble,specially when you are in emergency.

So we may think of designing a electronic medical insurance card,which can
store necessary information about the medical insurance the patient
bought, also the medical insurance history, if possible.When the person go
to see doctor,he only need to show his electronic card to him, and the
doctor, who has a special card-read machine,slides the card in that
machine, then, all the information are showed on the computer.No
explainning, no surfing, saves time.

The electronic medical card looks just like a credit card. It's easy to
carry.To make it usable, it must have a unique medical insurance number on
it,which can be the SSN of the patient,or the number provided by the
insurance company.And the country or the state where the insurance company
locate can build a database for those companies. All the legal insurance
company are required to register on that database, provide their medical
insurance information and report the updation to the country/state medical
database every year. It's convenient for customer to choose his medical
plan in that way.Before customer buy any medical insurance, he is required
to take a medical check in any hospital he can find, which should provide
the medical check for free or with little fee.(Costomer are required to
take the mecidal check every year and report the result to his insurance
company).With that check result, a customer can talk to the insurance company he
favors about the insurance plan. Based on the customer's health condition,
the company may decide which plan is better for that customer. and with
agreement, the company can store the health information into the
electronic medical card. This can help the doctors a lot.
