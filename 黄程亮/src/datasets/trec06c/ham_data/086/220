Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for taking time to reply. Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to help.

The <bic> is the only condition that is treated correctly by the <mwb> 
keyword. Any time I try and use a specific response key in the multiway 
branch (using the <mwb +M,201> syntax) I get the "no conditions met" error. 
If add S,P and D to the multiway branch then these are also not recognised.

I'm running out of ideas for things to try here. This is particularly 
frustrating since this is the only thing that is keeping the script from 
working.

Here's a chunk of the script again:

<brdiags 1> <id keyboard> <zil> <zor> <cr> <ntl> <nfb> f2 d20 <vm 1024, 
768, 768, 16, 0> <vzk +s> <vzk +p> <vzk +d> <vzk +M> <vzk +K> <vzk +B> <mpr 
+s> <mpr +p> <mpr +d> <mnr +m> <mnr +m> <mnr +b> <dbc 0> <dwc 255255255>
0 "press SPACE to start";
+1 <ln +2> "respond same / perhaps / different" , <ln +4> "or matt / kadia 
/ both to repeat" / * <wav 2> "m_orchid" /! <% 20> "" / <wav 2> "k_orchid" ;
~101 <mwb bic,0, +M,201, +K,401, +B,-1>;
+201 <ln +2> "respond same / perhaps / different", <ln +4> "or matt / kadia 
/ both to repeat" / * <wav 2> "m_orchid";
~301 <mwb bic,0, +M,-201, +K,401, +B,-1>;
+401 <ln +2> "respond same / perhaps / different", <ln +4> "or matt / kadia 
/ both to repeat" / * <wav 2> "k_orchid";
~501 <mwb bic,0, +M,-201, +K,-401, +B,-1>;
0 <ln -1> "item 1 - orchid", <ln +2> "press SPACE to move on to the next item";
+2 <ln +2> "respond same / perhaps / different", <ln +4> "or matt / kadia / 
both to repeat" / * <wav 2> "m_cousket" /! <% 20> "" / <wav 2> "k_cousket" ;
etc.

and the resulting zil output:

**********************************************************************
Subject 1, 02/21/2003 10:24:32 on PC195, refresh 13.33ms
Item 1, -4000.00
  2593.33,+K
!  No conditions met in multi-way branch
Item 201, -2606.95
  2606.95,+B
!  No conditions met in multi-way branch
Item 401, 1504.79
  1504.79,+S
!  Response correct, multi-way branch to item 0
Item 2, 1803.36
  1803.36,+S
!  Response correct, multi-way branch to item 0

As you can see the script runs fine, recording responses as expected. 
However, the multiway branch only handles "correct responses" such as "S" 
using the "bic" condition. Responses such as +K or +B which are mapped as 
negative (and hence incorrect) are not recognised by the multiway branch.

I would be grateful for any other suggestions you can make.

Cheers,

Matt
