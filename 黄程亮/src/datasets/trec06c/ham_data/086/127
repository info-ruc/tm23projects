 Being bothered by the fact that the superimposed wedges in the Refresh
Rate test flickered severely non-stop, and the test could never get more
than 10 or 12 consecutive cycles to time, I decided to update to the
latest driver, verson 41.09. Having done that, the Refresh Rate test
worked remarkably better, getting 100 consecutive cycles quickly.
However, suddenly, TimeDX could not create findable registry keys, it
seems. Am I the first one to find that updating this driver has this
effect? I don't even know what version of the driver I replaced, or
whether that version would still available from their website (I doubt
it). Any other suggestions for getting TimeDX to create findable
registry keys with a new version of a video driver? Just wait around for
a new video driver version?
