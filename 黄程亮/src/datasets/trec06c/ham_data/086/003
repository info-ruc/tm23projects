hi,

I want to do a reading experiment for single words
with my dyslexic patient. everything went very well so
far, the voice key works and records the RTs wich is
perfect. 
But how do I achieve that the written stimulus
disappears from the screen as soon as the subjects
responds (so that the voice onset triggers a blank
screen)?
For a key press response I added 'c' and that worked
(as in +1 *"Mensch"c;) but this does not work for the
voice key response.

Does anyone have experience with this or a similar
design? All help is very appreciated!
Thanks!

Christiane Bohn
