Dear Jonathan

         I'm extremely sorry to have sent attachments and buggered=20
everything.  It's a while since I spoke to the list and I completely forgot=
=20
about not sending attachments.  In your anger, I doubt whether you read my=
=20
message.  Would you be prepared to forgive me and read the message now?

         I'm trying to make a file with zillion responses.  I'm having=20
great problems, and I promise I've tried very hard to test many=20
alternatives.  One preliminary problem is that DM is telling me when the=20
subject has stopped pressing the button as well as the onset time.  How do=
=20
I suppress that?

         The main question is this.  Each trial has two parts, and I've=20
tried to do each trial as one as well as to split it into two.  the subject=
=20
has to give a binary decision first on an image, and then type the image's=
=20
name.

         I place BELOW my embarassingly incorrect file for your perusal.

         At the moment, I've got an item presenting the image and then a=20
second grouped item asking "mot?" for the name.  I don't care here if there=
=20
are no times at all, I just want to know what name the subject wants to=20
give the image.  My file at present has a clock on indicator in the second=
=20
part, because leaving it out didn't seem to work at all.

         When I test out what I've done I can't get the image to go away=20
when I respond.

         Many thanks for your help.

         Virginia
