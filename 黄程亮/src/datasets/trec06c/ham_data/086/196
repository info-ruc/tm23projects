   It's actually not a new card, originally it was a PCMCIA card but when 
PCMCIA got renamed to PCCARD they renamed the card too.  Laptops have never 
taken the normal interface cards with a DB37 on them, there's no way they 
could physically fit in the machine.  We've used the PCMCIA/PCCARD 
interface card in a laptop running windows ME but don't see any reason they 
wouldn't work in XP given all the TLC I put in getting XP drivers to work.
