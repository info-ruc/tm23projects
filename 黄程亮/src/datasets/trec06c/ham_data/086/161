Hi, I am trying to have DMDX search in multiple folders for a single jpg
file. I know that you can use "folder/stimulus" to look inside a folder
that is in the current directory to get a stimulus, but I have so many
stimuli that dmdx can't find them all in a single folder (and I can't have
certain <jpg> going to certain folders). Is there a way of having DMDX
look in multiple folders for a jpg that is only in one of them? I tried
setting a path to all of the folders in the autoexec.bat but that didn't
work. 
Thanks, Angelina
