My guess then, is that updating the video driver changed the name the 
"1 NVIDIA GeForce etc." option slightly (I have no way to tell), so 
that the registry key for the necessary video mode no longer worked, 
while it didn't change the name of the "0 pervychnyj videodrajver" 
option, and I must have in the dim dark past monkeyed with that 
option in TimeDX so that there was a registry key hanging around with 
the video mode called for by the item file. In that case, the mystery 
dissolves. The next time some ignoramus like me updates a video 
driver and suddenly an item file that was working fine leads to the 
registry key error message, you might guess that something similar 
has occurred.

I continue rereading it, understanding more each time. Certain things 
I will never understand until I find someone who knows what various 
terms mean (like "blit," etc.).

Thanks.

Warmly,
