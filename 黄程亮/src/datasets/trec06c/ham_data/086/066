Hi All,

I have figured out how to use VNC on my Windows XP laptop with SSH so
that I can log into a linux computer from outside the firewall and do
X-windows stuff.  Perhaps this is old news to some, but I had to
figure it out from scratch so here is a howto for those that care.
(In principle, I suppose you should be able to do this for windows
machines on the inside too).

1) Get the (free) VNC viewer for your laptop
   (http://www.uk.research.att.com/vnc/)

2) Get the (free) putty SSH client for your laptop 
   (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)

3) Work with putty and VNC within the firewall to gain some
   familiarity and make sure they're working

4) From outside the firewall, putty to your linux workstation, start
   the vncserver (use an 8 bit depth unless you've got lots of bandwidth
   or want the pictures to be pretty) and log out.

5) Restart putty and create a new session with:
   - Session/host name: ctioXX.ctio.noao.edu
   - Session/ssh: checked (this will make the port #22)
   - Connection/SSH/Enable compression: checked (unless the computers 
     concerned are very slow this makes a big difference to speed).
   - Connection/SSH/SSH protocol 2: checked
   - Connection/SSH/Tunnels/Enable X11 forwarding: checked
   - Connection/SSH/Tunnels/X display location: localhost:1
   - Connection/SSH/Tunnels/Port Forwarding: add a forwarded port with 
     source port 5901, destination ctioXX.ctio.noao.edu:5901, and "Local" 
     checked (please don't ask me why, I just know it works, and doesn't
     if you don't).
   Don't forget to save the putty session with a suitable name, or
   you'll have to do the setup every time.

6) Open this putty connection and log in to your workstation. You may be 
   asked to approve the encryption key.  This will actually look like 
   a normal putty connection and I think it can be used as such.  This
   window can be iconified to get it out of the way but don't kill it while
   you're running VNC.  (By the way, the VNC server must exist before this 
   connection is made so you can't use it to launch the server which is a 
   pity because it would mean one less step to the process.)

7) Start the VNC viewer, point it at port localhost:1, log into
   the VNC session and X to your heart's content.

This works fine with my setup and is quite useable via Entel Will.  I
imagine a modem might be somewhat less fun but workable in a pinch.
It is really very easy once set up and as long as you don't try and
wrap your brain around tunnelling.

Cheers,

	Tim
