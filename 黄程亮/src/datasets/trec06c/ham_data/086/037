Hello,

I had a problem with Dmdx and a Pent II, Windows 95, 64 RAM, ATI 3D 
PRO.  Well the problem was deduced to be Windows, so we upgraded to 
Widnows 98.  The problem persisted so then we assumed it was the 
display drivers (since Dmdx is running on two other computers that were 
exactly the same except for the monitor and display drivers).  Once the 
display drivers were upgraded dmdx appeared to work fine, albeit a bit 
slower when loading the program, but ran fine.  Well now the program is 
not running again.  I keep getting this error:

Could not find Registry key <SOFTWARE\TimeDX\0 Primary Display 
Drivers\640x480 (480)_8bpa_0Hz>

I have attempted to lower the resolution and refresh rates with no 
avail.  I also attempted to run older versions of Dmdx, again to no 
avail.  Does anybody have any other recourse we can follow through, as 
I feel the only explanation left is that this computer just does not 
like Dmdx!  Thank you.
