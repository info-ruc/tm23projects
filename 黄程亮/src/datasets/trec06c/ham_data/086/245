To the officers of the newly formed Gustavus Science Fiction and Fantasy Club:

CONGRATULATIONS!  After reviewing your application materials, I have found 
that not only have you completed the steps toward recognition and 
membership, but you did a thorough and impressive job of doing 
so.  Therefore, you are instated as a newly recognized student organization 
with all the benefits and privileges therein including use of the Den; a 
Den mailbox (which should be checked weekly if not more often); the ability 
to reserve space in Lund, the Union, JCC, and other areas; and the right to 
post stamped advertising in the Union and JCC.  Note that your mailbox will 
be before all other current boxes in the Den (and not in alpha 
order).  Further, this week I will send out an updated list of all the 
groups that are recognized (or "active") to Student Senate, the Lund Center 
(Larry Zelenz), the Dean of Students Office, and other areas on 
campus.  Should you have any questions about your recognition or status, 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Again, congratulations, and best of luck with your new group!

Ryan
