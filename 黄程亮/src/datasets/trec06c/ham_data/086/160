Jonathan,

If you were setting up a new DMDX system running under XP, what video 
card would be your first choice?

Also, I don't have a good sense of the demands that DMDX places on the 
computer (except that running some protocols on a 133Mhz pentium with 64 
MB RAM can be dicey at times).  Are processor speeds < 150 Mhz or < 64Mb 
RAM, for example, generally considered serious performance limiting 
factors?

Thank you,

Derek
