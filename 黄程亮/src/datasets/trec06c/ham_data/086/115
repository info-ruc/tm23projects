   You've got <clfb> in the parameter line for clear feedback, feedback has 
a delay before it's displayed and a duration.  You probably want <nfb> for 
no feedback.

   You probably also want to read the timing notes if you haven't already, 
you're going to have at least one extra tick on your ISI for the last blank 
frame.  Plus using <msfd> is not exactly recommended for exact timing as it 
divides the time you wanted by the refresh rate, who knows what the exact 
frame duration will be.

There's a fine line between courage and foolishness.  Too bad it's not
a fence.
