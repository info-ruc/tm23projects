Hi,
     I'm a Post grauduat student in China. When I use DMDX3.0 to write a
psychological experimental procedure, I meet a problem, please help me.
     This is a 2-back experiment, I must display 7-10 digitals or Chinese
characters continuesly, subjects have to press J or K continuesly to judge whether
the forth digitals or chinese characters is the same to first one, and whether the
fifth one is the same to the second one and so on.  The problem is: If I display
the 7-10 digitals or Chinese characters in only one item, I can't acquire 4-7
pieces of reaction time. I have try the <zil> keyword, but It gives me the
accumulated reaction time, not each one. So I display 7-10 digitals or Chinese
characters in 7-10 items, and I get 7-10 pieces of reaction time. But I still have
two problem:
    (1) I only need 4-7 pieces of reaction time, the first 1-3 pieces of reaction
time is not what I want, how to remove it without any influence?
    (2) I want to display each digital or Chinese character for 300 milliseconds,
every digital or Chinese character has 400 or 800 interval of black screen, and
subjects have to response during 300+400 or 300+800 milliseconds. But I found the
interval of each digital or Chinese character is not 400 milliseconds, although I
set the <d 0>, the interval time is apparently longer than 400 or 800
milliseconds.  Why it is longer? In addition, I set the <roct> keyword and check
the .azk file, I found the time between two clockon is not 700 or 1100
milliseconds, It's longer also although I set the <d 0>. I believe that DMDX is
excerlent, maybe I do the wrong thing, maybe I use the <t 700> or <t 1100>
inappropriatly, But I didn't know why it is longer. So I paste my item file to
you, Please tell me the answer.  Thank you!
