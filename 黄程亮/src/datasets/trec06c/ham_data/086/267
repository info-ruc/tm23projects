   You could probably even use your original bic solution: <mwb bic,0, 
+M,201, +K,401, +B,-1>;

   The philosophy of the clearing of the key code for <mwb> is in somewhat 
of a quandry.  It was done long before the enhanced branching to 
subroutines and <skipdisplay> items made checking branch conditions across 
items a meaningful thing to do.  I strongly suspect I'll stop clearing it 
unless I or one of you can think of a condition that would be broken by not 
clearing it.
