   Yeah, next version (which I won't release unless it's immediately useful 
to someone) will allow <mwb> use across items.  From the new <mwb> 
documentation:


     NOTE: Prior to version 3.0.1.2 of DMDX the <mwb> keyword had to occur 
in the item that gathered the response if you were branching on key 
names.  While the data used for bic and so forth persisted until the next 
RT was gathered the name of the key was cleared when a new <mwb> was parsed 
so that binr would behave correctly.  As of 3.0.1.2 the branching key name 
is cleared when the next clockon is parsed so <mwb> is now useful for 
extended processing.
