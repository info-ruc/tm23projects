Dear Jonathan

         Thanks so much for your advice.  I didn't understand about being=20
able to switch on and off the two modes.  Of course, something like you=20
suggested doesn't work yet.  I thought I had better get a simple zillion=20
typed response file going before I tried the switching.  So I made this.

  <ep> <n 3> <cr> <s 2> <clfb> <id =93clavier=94> <mr +espace> <zil> <ztr>=
=20
<zek> <zekn +entr=E9e> <vzk +supprimer> <vzk +retour arri=E8re> <t 10000>=
 <eop>

$0 "Items d'essai.  Quand pr=EAt, appuyez sur la barre espace.";

=3D250 %20 / <bmp> * "avion" ; $

0 "Items de test.  Quand pr=EAt, appuyez sur la barre espace." ;

=3D250 %20 / <bmp>  * "crocodile" ;
=3D250 %20 / <bmp>  * "accord=E9on" ;

$0 LB "Fin de cette partie, merci." ; $

         One problem is that the syntax test tells me that it can't find=20
+delete.  It tells me that early on and also just before it stops.  Is=20
there something built in that wants this english keyboard name?  if so,=20
that would mean zil could only be used with english keyboards.  (I tried=20
telling the computer that the keyboard was a default american one, and put=
=20
id =3D keyboard, but that didn't parse.)

         It also says that it can't find +entre and (+retour arrire)=20
(leaves out the accents).  But these are the button names for enter and for=
=20
backspace.  In other tests it has no trouble with maj gauche and maj=20
droit.  Are the accents in these names bothering it?  When one does the PIO=
=20
test, it gives numbers as well as french names for the buttons, so at one=20
point I tried putting for example #21, but it didn't like that.  When I try=
=20
to specify buttons which on the french keyboard are where american numbers=
=20
are, e.g., =E9 where 2 is, it doesn't find them either.

         Also, you told me that avoiding getting response off times was=20
done by specifying permissible buttons.  So I have to do that even though=20
the syntax test lists all the main buttons and says they are already mapped?

         Thanks very much for your patience.

         Virginia
