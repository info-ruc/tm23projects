Thanks for the idea. No, I'm using Windows 98. However, DMDX was looking
for a registry key that differed from the one chosen with the Select
Video Mode command (looking for one with 8 bits, when I'd selected 16).
I couldn't change that, and so I tried switching from the video driver
"1 NVIDIA GeForce 2 MX 100/200" which I had used with the previous
driver version, to the one called "0 pervychnyj videodrajver" and
presto. Up and running again. So upgrading the video driver led to a
change in terms of which of the three options offered by the Select
Video Command is the one that works. (Actually, with the previous driver
version, both "NVIDIA GeForce 2 MX 100/200" and "pervychnyj
videodrajver" worked, while with the updated driver, only the latter
works.)

These sudden glitches sure can eat up a lot of time. Does it ever get
better? Somebody tell me it gets better.

Greg
