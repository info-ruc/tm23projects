I just got this from Marshall Perrin about
the terms by which RedHat plans to support their
Linux OS with patches.

Please direct your web browsers to

https://www.redhat.com/apps/support/errata/

For more complete info.  I am not sure how to interpret
this, short of saying that unless there is great demand
for it, RedHat won't support any version of Linux past
the current release (or its more expensive counterparts)
for more than a year after its release.
