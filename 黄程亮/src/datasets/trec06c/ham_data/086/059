Hi all,

The refresh rate of my monitor is 16.57ms.   I set the items to be displayed 
at 300 ticks each.  Therefore, with the RT accuracy test, I should obtain a 
figure somewhere around 4971ms.  Nevertheless, I have obtained sth different.

Subject 2, 01/30/2003 16:58:41 on I8D0U9, refresh 16.68ms
  Item       RT       COT
     1  -1300.00      0.00
     2  -1300.00   6153.41
     3  -1300.00  12306.82
     4  -1300.00  18460.27
     5  -1300.00  24613.64

Even with the refresh rate 16.68ms, the COT should be about 5000ms, rather 
than 6153ms.

There may also be some problems with the ticks and display .  Since some of 
the items are visibly slower, in the output file, display error was stated.  
!  Display error at msec 225857.94, tick 12666 in item 115, frame ""
!    16.49ms of refused video flips occured
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)
!    -- possibly caused by another process taking 1 tick

As my stimuli are Chinese characters, there was a small dot appearing near the 
bottom left side of some characters (but not all) despite its absence in the 
input files.

Furthermore, after running several sessions, the program do not run on opening 
a new sessions, with the dialogue box noting that there was illegal operations 
and the program aborted immediately.

What could I do to solve the problems above?  
The configuration of my PC is Pentium III 700Mhz, Chinese Window 98, 32MB 
video memory.

Thank you very much.

Regards,
Mabel Wan
