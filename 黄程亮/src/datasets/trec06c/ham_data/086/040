Hello -

I have been working with DMDX and wish to use a GamePad to record response
time for a maze task. (Two words are presented, the subject needs to choose
the right or left word.)  The actual type is GamePad Pro USB by Gravis.
I cannot get DMDX to recognize the buttons. First question:
	
For this device what Input Device do I use?

After I have this I think I can get the buttons to map using the <mpr >
and <mnr > commands to chose the buttons for a yes and no response.

I have used TimeDX to see which buttons correspond to the button names (i.e.
"button 4").  There are buttons 0-9 and when in TimeDX I can press a button
and get the button name to highlight.  However, I cannot make this work
in DMDX.

I have searched the online tutorials, and FAQ's to see if this has been
addressed previously, however, I was unable to find just the right information.
