   <D 0> is not possible, it means schedule the items as rapidly as 
possible (and therefore inaccurately).  I'll have to update the docs I guess.

   If you had an infinitely fast computer you could have a D of 0, 
otherwise your machine has take some time to prepare the next item.  Look 
at the Preparation times in the errors you might encounter:

   Pick some positive value of D that is longer than the sum of the longest 
preparation times in your item file.

There's a fine line between courage and foolishness.  Too bad it's not
