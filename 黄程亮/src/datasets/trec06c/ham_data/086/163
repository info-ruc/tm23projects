   No.  Use specific paths, for instance:

  +1 * "c:\full\path\filanme.jpg";

   You can use relative paths if you need to.  Assuming you ran the item 
file our of c:\full the following should work:

  +1 * "path\filanme.jpg";
                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X
