Dear Jonathan

         Thanks very much for your comments.  yes, the timedx test lists=20
the button names with accents in them.

         I've now tried a zil file without the enter key option.  the=20
syntax check still tells me that it can't find +delete but fortunately=20
proceeds anyway.  So this little file at least works (hooray), and stores=20
what the subject typed, though i haven't got the please-go-away timing=20
right yet.

  <ep> <n 3> <cr> <s 2> <clfb> <id =93clavier=94> <mr +espace> <zil> <ztr>=
 <t=20
10000> <eop>

$0 "Items d'essai.  Quand pr=EAt, appuyez sur la barre espace.";

=3D250 %20 / <bmp> * "avion" ; $

0 "Items de test.  Quand pr=EAt, appuyez sur la barre espace." ;

=3D250 %20 / <bmp>  * "crocodile" ;
=3D250 %20 / <bmp>  * "accord=E9on" ;

$0 LB "Fin de cette partie, merci." ; $

         I found it interesting that one can switch between french and=20
english keyboards in word or in an email say, but having tried to leave the=
=20
keyboard switched to french, dm still reports for example the press of a=20
button marked q for the french version as an a.  So spelling avion gives=20
qvion.  It would be bad news if the times were of major importance, but as=
=20
they are not, I can paper over the keys which are different so that they=20
have english labels.  I will also instruct the poor subjects not to spell=20
with accents.  As you point out, they can't correct what they have written=
=20
either, but fortunately for this expt correct spelling is not important.

         So, we could say that it 'kindof' works.

         Many thanks once again,

         Virginia
