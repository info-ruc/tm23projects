   I suspect option 1 is not possible, I don't think I ever added anything 
that would allow parsing of zillion responses.  You could only do it after 
the fact with another program.  Option 2 is certainly possible, just start 
the clock at the beginning of the item, turn DMDX's feedback routines off 
with <nfb> and provide your own custom feedback routine (examples are in 
the <SetCounter> docs as I recall) and compare the XT (raw RT before 
correctness is determined) to the time the target would have been displayed 
after the start of the trial.
