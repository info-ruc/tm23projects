   You use <vzk> to validate the keys you want to record like it says in 
the documentation.

   You'll probably have to turn <ZillionTypedResponses> on and off through 
the item file.  Hopefully a french KB won't screw it up too much.  You'll 
probably have to tell DMDX the name of the enter key with 
<ZillionEnterKeyName>.  Note that using <ztr> is going to validate the 
normal typing keys but you'll need to add your response keys too.

   Because you specify <nfb>, no feedback, no clearing of the screen.  You 
might want to try <ClearFeedback>.  However feedback doesn't work well with 
<zil> anyway unless you turn on <ZillionOneResponse>, but you'll want to 
toggle that on and off too as typed responses are probably going to get 
blasted by <zor>.  Also <ztr> is best if there's feedback so the subject 
can see what they're typing.

   So you'll need something like this:

  <ep> <n 14> <clfb> <cr> <g 2> <s 2> <id “clavier”> <zil> <ztr> <vzk +maj 
droit> <vzk +maj gauche> <vzk +espace> <mpr +maj droit> <mnr +maj gauche> 
<mr +espace> <eop>

-250 <zor 1> <ztr 0> %15 / <bmp> *  "cerise" ;
=250 <zor 0> <ztr 1> %15 * “Mot?” ;
