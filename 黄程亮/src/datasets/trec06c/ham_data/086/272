I seem to recall having a similar problem.  If you open a DOS window (I think 
it's called command line in XP) and run DMDX using the -buffers N command, you 
can determine what N should be in order for the machine not to freeze.  Then 
you could edit the windows shortcut for DMDX and include the -buffers N 
command, which will avoid the problem recurring in the future.

Good luck,
Anna W.
