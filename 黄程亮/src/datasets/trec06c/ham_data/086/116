Hello Mr Jonathan,

    I read through your letter carefully and changed the <clfb> with the <nfb> in
my item file according to your advice, then my problem was solved. The time
between two clockon almost 700+delay or 1100+delay, and when I replace <ms% N>
with <fd N>, I received more exact time. Although I can't receive the very exact
time-700 or 1100, but I think it is enough to behavioral experiment. So I write
this letter to thank you! Thank you for your help once more!


Wang, G.M
