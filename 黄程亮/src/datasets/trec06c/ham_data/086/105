Does anyone know of a linux version of a program like this?  It's
intent is to take a graph/figure that's in JPG or GIF (or PNG or
whatever)  and allow you to output the datapoints on the graph (via
clicking or whatever)... which is a lot better and more accurate than
using a damn ruler.

Hey Everyone,

For future reference, and if you ever use a windows machine, the
image-to-data converter is called WinDig:

I'd be happy to hear of a linux version of this software but I haven't
done any searching.

Cheers,
