   Certainly there are some machines that just plain can't handle DMDX and 
they're usually old machines.  However that message means you need to time 
that video mode, if it was timed in the past then something has damaged the 
registry.  Perhaps the hard disk is failing and you need to check it's 
integrity.  Perhaps you just need to reformat it and install 98 from 
scratch and see if it gets better.
