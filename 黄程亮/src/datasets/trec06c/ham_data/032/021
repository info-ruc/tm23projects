i am sorry, but i have never readied that software.

to debug, use a logic probe and check all of the 28 pins of the RAM
chip.  address, data, and enable lines should be flashing when the HB
is turned on.  if you see a line stuck at 0 or 1 that might be an
indication of problems.

in my experience it is rarely a failed chip; usually bad wiring or
soldering on the PCB is to blame.
