I'm not familiar with the Wirz board, however the board I built used the
regular "motor output" of the handyboard with no modification required. The
trick was to use an opto-isolator to "recover" the forward and backward
logic states. That was done as follows:

<pre>
HB Motor out -----\/\/\/\/-------+---------------+
                    680          |               |
                                 |              _|_   
                                \ /  Opto1       ^    Opto2
                                _V_             / \   
                                 |               |
                                 |               |
HB Motor out --------------------+---------------+
</pre>

The NECP2502 works fine. Then on the output side of the optoisolator
connect the transistors as follows:
<pre>
           +5v
           |
         | /
         |/
         | Opto1
         |\
         | V
           |
           +-----o A
           |
           /
           \
           / 47K
           \
           |
           |
          Gnd
</pre>
And repeat this for the other half othe opto-isolator (opto2). Now you will
have two outputs A, B and the truth table for these outputs is
	A    B
       0    0     Do nothing (ie stop)
       1    0     Go Forward
       0    1     Go Backward
       1    1     Can't happen (unless you fry the opto isolators LEDs :-)

Alternatively you can hook up A & B to an OR gate and generate an "ENABLE"
line and a "DIRECTION" line (use either A or B for the direction value). 

Another advantage of this scheme is that since the adaptor circuit is built
out of an optotiolator there is no requirement that your motor subsystem
run off the same power as the handyboard, thus enabling either higher
voltage motors or lower voltage motors to be run from the h-bridge that is
"slaved" to the motor outputs on the Handyboard.
