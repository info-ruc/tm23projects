Dear Fred Martin/friends,
	We have put a total of 6 chips on the handy board-the 6811 ,two
chips placed side by side to the left of the 6811, the fat chip on the
upper side of the 6811, two ICs(chips) one on each side of the fat
chip.(component side) Please mind my language, I have not done the
soldering and hence I don't know the chip nos.
	The pcode_hb.s19 file downloads fine but when we reset the board
the speaker beeps continously and IC does not boot up.
	Please tell me what could be the problem and its solution?
Thanking you,						Yours Sincerely,
							    Nitin
