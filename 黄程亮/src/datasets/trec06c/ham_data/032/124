good beginner questions...

you can use either.  if you use the one on the interface, then power
goes through the phone cable to charge the HB.  if you use the one on
the HB, then power goes through the phone cable to operate the ckts on
the interface.

also, in a pinch, you can run the HB with *no* adapter, since the HB's
battery can power the ckts on the interface.

yes,

having the jack on the HB lets you put it somewhere and keep it
charged w/o using the interface.

the ideal motor is 9v.  hobby toy motors are typically 3v and
specifically do NOT work.  please see the FAQ for more info on motor
compatibility:

no, but why would you want to use anything else :-)?

seriously, IC is extremely beginner-friendly (once you get it
configured and working).  other options are assembly language and
traditional compile-debug-download-crash C compilers.  these do work;
see the "Commercial Software" page.
