sorry, send my msg before it was done.

right, this is a good answer.  you buy a device called an "electronic
speed controller".  this connects like a servo to the HB and has
outputs to drive high current DC motors.  you also connect a separate
power supply to the device.  so the configuration is:


				 +6v (four C cells)
    Handy Board			   |
  +----------------+	  +--------|-------+
  |                |      |      +Vin      |
  |       servo out+------+servo in     out|-------+
  |                |	  |                |	 DC motor
  |       motor gnd+--+---+gnd          out|-------+
  |                |  |   |	ESC        |
  +----------------+  |   +----------------+
		      |
		      +----- 0v (gnd of C cell pack)

please see the HB servo pages for info on servo drivers, 

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/software/libs.html

the motor gnd line is the right half of the 4x1 header immediately
above to the the right of the Stop button.

you can buy the ESC's in all sorts of current capacities.  try tower
hobbies as a supplier.  <http://www.towerhobbies.com/>.
