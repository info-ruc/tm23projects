I am new to the Handy board and Mine is  in the starting phases of 
construction.  I would like to ask the more experienced roboticist.

1. Why is there a power jack on both the Handy board and the charger?

does the Interface need power? and if there is a power jack on the 
Handy board what is the purpose of the charger?

 2. Do you need high voltage motors(12+volts) or can you use regular 
DC motors the kind that are used to operate childrens toys?

 3. Is Interactive C a nessecity?  A friend was telling me to check 
if you could use a language from other 6811 boards?
