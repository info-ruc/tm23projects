	I have nearly teared my hair out trying to get my HB to to DL on a my OS8
6500 Mac.
   I though there might be someting wrong with the HB and replaced 5 chips.
Today I took my HB over to a friends house who has a Performa 475 and hand had
no problems.
  It took an INit and then the Downloading of the HB librabries contained in
IC Verson 2.53.   I should add that the HB would take the download of the HB
IC 2.53 if the P-code had been loaded else where(i.e. not the Mac OS8
computer.

  To further compund things-I purchased IC student version and it won't
download off of System 7 or my own OS8   My particular computer? Possible but
if so wher would I look?  The serial drivers come on a CD-what would
reinstalling them acvcomplish?  I don't even think you can like on a PC.  The
computer works fine with everything else.  Shoot myself?  Possible solution.
Buy a PC?  Probably the most inteligent thing I've said so far.
   Fred-you know MACs-anyhelp appreciated.  Cappy Anderson, York, ME 03909
