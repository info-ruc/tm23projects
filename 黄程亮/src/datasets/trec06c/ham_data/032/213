I'm pretty good at software and may be able to help you.  But I need to see your
code: please send it to me privately and I'll see what I can do.

PS:  What kind of hardware/software platform are you on?  "Yacc" is typically a
Unix program that I thought had nothing to do with IC.  (And yes, the real Unix
"yacc" can stack overflow with excessively nested if/then/else quite easily...
I just fixed a problem like that for my employer).
