 Ummm, Hi all

     I'm looking for a circuit that will interface a photo transistor or a
photo diode to a digital input. I tried a photocell in an analog port but
it's too slow, I want to use a *visible* light pulse as an accurate
trigger: ie. input triggered when light goes on. I think a transistor or a
diode will be fast enough, but I have no idea how to hook up such a device.
Thresholding won't be a problem as the sensor will be in total darkness
until hit by very bright light. I'm sure this is pretty simple...?

Thanks, Duncan
