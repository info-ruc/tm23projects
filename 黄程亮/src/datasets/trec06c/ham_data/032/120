We have revised the Handy Board Expansion Board Kit documentation to refer
to the information on the Handy Board website.

Tom Brusehaver is correct in his post that the J11 flex cable connector is
not included in the kit as it is supplied with the Polaroid 6500 Sonar
Imaging System. J7 however, is not a part. J7 refers simply to an open hole
on the PCB that requires no part.

The Handy Board Expansion Board Kit (and Handy Boards and Serial/Interface
Boards) are available from:
