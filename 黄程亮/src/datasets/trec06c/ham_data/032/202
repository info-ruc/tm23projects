Firstly, it looks like the sensor board can be powered from the HB using the motor power header (J13).  This is good, because the two should share a common ground.

Based on the schematic and the web page description, it looks like this type of ultrasonic sensor will give a digital signal instead of an analog signal.  The LED lights up when an object gets close enough.

Apparently, the transistor T1 provides continuity to ground for the LED/R1 combination.  Try replacing the LED with a male header plug and plugging it into a digital port on the HB.

BE CAREFUL THOUGH:  The ultrasonic sensor runs on 9 to 12 V, so you will need to ensure that resistor R1 is at least a few kOhms to ensure that you don't fry your digital sensor port, which is designed for 5V MAXIMUM.

I don't know about this.  If you use an external battery, make sure it's compatible with the HB's charging circuitry.  Probably any 9.6V NiCd battery pack would suffice.

If you use a light sensor connected to analog port 0, you first need to calibrate it.  Put a candle in front of it and make a note of the sensor reading.  Suppose it's about 200.  The following sort of Interactive C code would probably work:

	int threshold = 190;

	while( 1 ) {	/* (this begins indefinite loop) */
		if( analog( 0 ) > threshold ) break;	/* (break out of loop) */
		/* search for candle for a moment */
	}
	/* snuff out the candle */

Good luck!
