Its a 50mm square HD about 20 grams. cap. 170 - 340 MB.
Uses CompactFlash type II interface. Low power 3.3V.
here a another link   http://www.storage.ibm.com/hardsoft/diskdrdl/micro/

You can get the spec's for CF @   
http://www.compactflash.org/cfspc1_3.pdf

I'm not too adept of a programmer, but I bet the little HD can be converted
to a serial interface...maybe some techies out there are up to the
challenge.

Perhapse the little HD can cache mapping, special prgms, video, event/fault
logging. . . .

I see that other vendors are on the microdrive path too.
