yes, memory wires should be oscillating, back and forth betw 0 and 5
volts.  this is not floating; floating implies not connected.

re: your other DL probs, usually, it is a bad connection on the PCB.
try continuity checks on the memory subsystem.  this is about 30 to 40
connections, a bit painstaking, but often it's not a bad chip, but a
bad connection on the PCB.
