i am unable to reproduce the problem.

perhaps comms between IC and your board are still unreliable. 

try writing a program that repeatedly prints to the LCD screen the
result of 123 * 2.  my guess is that it will work perfectly.

also, make sure you have retrieved pcode_hb.s19 directly from the
library web page, and downloaded it into your HB.
