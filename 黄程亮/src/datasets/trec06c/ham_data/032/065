A digital port can't have the capability of an analog port, since it has
only one bit of information with which to work.  (A 256-value analog
port has eight bits.)  You could perhaps hook an analog sensor up to a
digital port using some sort of thresholding circuit (a voltage
divider/transistor combination), but you would have to preset the
threshold to a constant value, and the HB would then see it as a digital
device.

Using an analog port as a digital, on the other hand, is easy.

The above will not work (although I don't know what sort of error you
will get).

The above would work ok, although it's a little more terse to say:

     else if( digital( 3 ) ) {...}

It's the same as "if( analog( 3 ) > 127 )".  It basically just throws
away the other seven bits of information.

Note that with an 8-bit D-A convertor circuit, one ought to be able to
use one analog port for up to eight digital inputs at a time.
