Hi John,

I am interested in your handyboard !

I'm curious, when you say your board only has one motor chip is that
something
you added on or does that mean it only has one of the four outputs for
DC
motors,
that usually comes with the board. Or does that refer to one of two
L293D on the
schematic? s I'm sorry I'm fairly new to this kind of thing so...

Did you put the board together yourself and how old is it?

Thanks for playing 20 questions!
