When I first got my HC11EVB I ran 12V straight into the E port (one of
the pins), and was sure I ruined the chip.  I called the tech support
person at motorola, and he said 12V on a A/D port should be no
problem.  Sure enough it all still worked.

I think somewhere in the "pink book", it does state that 200% of
reference voltage is ok.
