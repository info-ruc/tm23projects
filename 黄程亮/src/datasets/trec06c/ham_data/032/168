Sure, just hack your HB to use an external battery for the motors.  The
external battery can be whatever voltage the motors prefer (within
reason).  If the motors still draw too much current, try piggybacking
another set of motor driver chips on top of the ones you already have. 
See the FAQ for details.

With the cheaper motors and the modifications suggested above, the
bulldozer ought to run just fine.  The main difference remaining is that
the cheap motors are usually not as efficient as more expensive motors
would be, so you may have to recharge the motor battery more often.  No
big deal!  Good luck.
