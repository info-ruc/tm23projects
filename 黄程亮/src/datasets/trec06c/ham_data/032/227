IC is implemented using lex and yacc (tools originally on unix systems
for building parsers and compilers, which generate C code that be
compiled into apps on many platforms).

as someone pointed out, if yacc barfs, it's because you've got an
expression that is too heavily nested and thus requires too much stack
to parse.  so yes, it's a compile-time stack issue, having nothing to
do with IC process stack space.

i don't know if the commercial IC will do any better.  it depends if
more stack is allocated to yacc.  randy could answer this.

i think you already know your answer---break up your program into
smaller chunks.

I'm pretty good at software and may be able to help you.  But I need to see you
r
code: please send it to me privately and I'll see what I can do.

PS:  What kind of hardware/software platform are you on?  "Yacc" is typically a
Unix program that I thought had nothing to do with IC.  (And yes, the real Unix
"yacc" can stack overflow with excessively nested if/then/else quite easily...
I just fixed a problem like that for my employer).
