Hi everyone:

    I'm trying to download a rather large chunk of code to the HandyBoard,
and I'm having a problem when I exceed a certain number of instructions in a
procedure I'm running.  When I try to download the code, I get the error
"yacc stack overflow" pointing to a line in a procedure that I spawn to be
multitasked.

I tried to increase the stack size of the process I spawn, but the error
still exists.  I think I might be getting a compile-time stack overflow - or
something like that.  The procedure it crashes for is a leg controller, and
consists of many "if .. else if" statements.

It would be bad design to move some of the code to another procedure, and I
would like to avoid doing that.  Does anyone know exactly why I'm having
this problem, or what I could do to remedy the situation?

Thanks in advance.
