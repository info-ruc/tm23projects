Hi everyone,

Announcing this year's MIT LEGO Robot Design Competition!  As always,
the contest is open to the general public at no charge, with seating
available on a first-come, first-serve basis.

This year's contest is called "Raiders of the Lost Parts."  Lots of
information about the contest, including the full rule set, is
available at the course home page:
  
  http://web.mit.edu/6.270/www/home.html

The contest is held in MIT lecture hall 26-100.  This is accessible
either from Mass Ave or Vassar Street.  Please refer to the map at
  
  http://whereis.mit.edu/bin/map?locate=bldg_26

If coming from Mass Ave, enter at the dome (Building 7), and walk down
the "Infinite Corridor" (building 7 through 3, 10, 4, then 8), and
turn left and walk through building 16 to reach building 26.  

If coming from Vassar Street, enter through building 34 (which has a
polygonal glass atrium), exit at the left back door, and walk outside
with building 26 on your left and buildings 24 and 12 on your right,
and enter building 26 underneath an overhang.

Or, get in the vicinity and ask a student.

When to arrive:  the room is guaranteed to be filled to capacity, so
the only way to get seating is to arrive early and camp out.  My
advice is to come in a group, arriving by 4:15 (and certainly no later
than 4:45), sit down and send someone out for pizza.  The content
starts at 6 pm.  When seating runs out (usually, by 5:15), there will
be an overflow room with a video feed.

Parking:  street parking is available on Mass Ave, Vassar Street,
Amherst Street, and most side streets.  On the bigger roads it's
metered till 6pm.  In late afternoon, it shouldn't be hard to find a
spot and put enough coins in the meter to last till 6, when parking is
free.


Hope to see you there!

Fred
