Hi Jeremy,

Question:    Do you use 30V  for your Motor ? (external)

IF NO:

I=B4m testing several Motors from copier-machines (12V-24V) with my HB. S=
ome
motors didn=B4t work properly with PWM.

For example    Motor 24V    I=B4m using ist with for 12V Motor (0,100) th=
e
Motor works fine (100=3DFull speed =3D 12V)
                        IF i decrease the speed with PWM (Motor(0,0..100)
the motor didn=B4t have enough torque !!!!

The main problem is, i found out during my tests, a lot of motors with mo=
re
then 12V don=B4t work properly with PWM,
if you are using lower voltage


Tschau

Bernd
