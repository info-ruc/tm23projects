I tried to use the special RC motor drivers for RC race cars with good luck,
they simply connect to a servo output of the handy board and they work great
and you can get them in a thousand different configurations like fwd/rev and
brakes. They work with PWM so they won't really get very hot and they can
easily handle the high current for these motors.

Good luck,

Jan.
