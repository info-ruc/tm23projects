Dear Mr Fred Martin/friends,
	Thank you for giving the site of the new library files.We started 
IC properly today.It gave NO 'synchronizing with board' errors.
	We input 1 + 2; and it gave the proper result.However when 123 * 2;
was entered at the C> prompt we got the result as 123.We  tried again and 
at the next instance we got the result as 246. Repeated trying gave random 
results varying between 123 and 246.Once it even gave 492 as the result.
	We entered the computation as 123.0 * 2.0;, we got the proper 
answer.
	I want to know whether there is any bug in the software or is it a
hardware mistake?We have written a program to navigate a rover through 
obstacles and in that program we use multiplication of integers.
	Please reply as soon as possible.
							Yours sincerely,
							    Nitin
