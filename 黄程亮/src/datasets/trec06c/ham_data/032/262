Hi Everyone:

My handy boards were working fine all this time but suddenly 
they seem to have developed a problem. The boards do not show
the interactive C welcome message. I tried downloading the pcode 
file a number of times. That file downloads fine, but after that
the IC message does not come. And if i try to run ic after that,
Board not responding message comes. Any help would be welcome,
this is a critical time of my project.

Thanks,

raj
