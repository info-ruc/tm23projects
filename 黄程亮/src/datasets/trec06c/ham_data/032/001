By ground, I just meant the HB ground.  The important thing is just that
everything in an electronic system share the same ground; voltages are
relative, and the ground is just the shared reference point--the point
arbitrarily defined to be zero volts.  Unless your robot has spark plugs
and a CB radio, there is no need for an earth ground strap  ;-]
