That sounds like too much voltage for the HB.  I think I remember
reading that the HB runs on up to 12 V max.  Check the Handy Board
Technical Reference.  There are much better ways to run motors that
require higher voltages.  Try using a separate motor power source
(requires severing a trace on the HB--see the FAQ for details).
