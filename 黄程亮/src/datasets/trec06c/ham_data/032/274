in the business that im at (ok a tv station) sometimes we find chips 
(left  in boxes and such) that we have absolutely no idea what they are 
for, recently i found a chip "N82S100N K84" I suspect its from Signetics 
which i am told has merged with philips semi, but at their website 
theres no info on this particular chip.
If someone can tell me what this chip does i would be most grateful, 
also is there a reliable chip directory on the web?

thanks and regards

bernardo mendez
