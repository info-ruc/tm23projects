Hi there,

In my humble opinion, I suspect that the problem is with
Interactive C.. Try a newer or older version. What  version
are you using, by the way ?

To quote Levine et al, "lex & yacc",  2nd Ed, O'Rielly & Assoc
page 259:
"yacc stack overflow  ....The yacc generated grammar has
exhausted its stack space ... Solution: Shorten or reorder the
expressions in the lex specification; rebuild lex with a larger
yacc stack area."

Hope this helps.

Regards,
