Subject: Serial LCD on PA4?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am trying to send serial data to a 2-Line LCD which is connected to
Scott Edwards' 9600baud backpack. I have PA4 available. I came across
Fred Martin's  'Pa7_9600' serial files which included Pa7_9600.asm and
Pa7_9600.icb and am wondering if they can be modified for PA4.

I am new to the 68HC11 and am learning as I gather more and more info
from the web.


Thanks to Fred Martin, my analog ir proximity problem was solved by
removing the 47K pull-up resistors.
