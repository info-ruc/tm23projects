yes, you are having lib conflicts.  you should get the latest at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/software/base.html

the latest has _raw_analog in the .icb file and NOT in the lib_hb.c
file.

re: synchronizing probs, try running IC in a full screen DOS window,
or boot your computer in DOS mode. the freeware IC doesn't run very
well under win 95/98; it's an old DOS program.
