I was reading the FAQ (again), and unless I overlooked something, it seems that even with the H-bridge or piggybacking solutions, I would not be able to drive a high-end R/C car engine (20+ amps)...

So here are my questions:

1 - Could I lower the amount of current draw, by doing something like motor(1, 20); ? How much lower could I go by doing this ?

2 - Is there any hack that I could do on the motor (like yanking or adding some of the internal wiring), that would make it draw much less current ? I apologize if this is too stupid of an idea, but as you may have noticed from this (and previous) postings, I'm very new to eletronics... :(

3 - What else could I do ? Any other ideas ? I guess replacing the engine altogheter is not an option, because the engine has some specific (I don't know how standard that is...) mounting points...

4 - Has anyone used the HB to drive a high end R?C car ? What was your solution to the above problem, please ?

Best regards,

Andre Philippi.
