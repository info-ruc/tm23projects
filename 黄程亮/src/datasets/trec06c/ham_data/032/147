Hello, folks.

My first foray back onto the list in a few years.
 I checked the archives and didn't see an answer to this question,
 so here goes:

Until recently, I taught a freshmen robotics seminar using old
 6.270 boards, motors, and parts bought from past contestants.
 Recently I got some money to move over to 6 new Handy Boards, as the
 old 6.270 boards were unreliable (soldered in a hurry by students
 learning to solder, etc..). In general the Handy Boards are great,
 but I have one big problem:

The motor driver chips (the TI SN75 ones) burn out pretty easily
 when I use the 6.270 motors. I don't know anything about the 6.270
 motors except that they come from Polaroid, but maybe because they
 were originally selected to run off of the 6-volt 6.270 board
 batteries (and through the 1.6 amp 6.270 board motor drivers rather
 than the 1 amp handyboard motor drivers), they draw too much current 
 with the 9-volt handyboard batteries?

I notice that the motor driver chips on the Handyboard are not heat
 sinked in any way. Has anyone had experience heat sinking them?

Has anyone tried stacking TI SN75whatever chips to get a better
 current rating? Do you think this would work?

Does anyone have suggestions for a good place to get other 9-volt 
 motors (and cheaper than the lego motors)?

I'd rather not go to some much more expensive motor driver like the
 LMD18200 ($20 each, and a different pinout)... after buying the Handy
 Boards I don't have too much money left.

thanks for any and all suggestions,
--
