Still unable to load the expansion board files.
lib_hb.lis is in the libs.
How do I do ic _config in windows? do I need to?
System will run fine until I try to load the expansion board files.
I downloaded hbexplib.zip,unziped,put all expansion-libs inc:\ic\libs.

Synchronizing with board
Pcode version 3.10 present on board
Loading C:\IC\libs\lib_hb.lis.
Loading lib_hb.c.
Loading C:\IC\libs\lib_hb.icb.
Loading C:\IC\libs\libexpbd.icb.
Loading C:\IC\libs\expsens.c.
Loading C:\IC\libs\expservo.icb.
Loading C:\IC\libs\explego.icb.
C:\IC\libs\expsens.c(2): parse error close to token "<illegal>"
Errors, unloading files
Cannot find file lib_hb.lis or file lib_hb.lis
C:\IC\libs\expsens.c(2): parse error close to token "<illegal>"

				Thanks to All;
