check that the RxD line on the hc11 is properly pulled up to +5v
through R15.

also, make sure you are *HOLDING DOWN* the STOP button until the BATT
light goes off.  this wasn't clear from your msg.

finally, try getting the HB into boot mode with the serial adapter
board not connected.  apply power through the charge jack and leave
the RJ11 jack free.  

if you succeed in obtaining boot mode (PWR LED off but board is turned
on) with serial interface disconnected, you can be pretty certain that
problem is in your serial interface.
