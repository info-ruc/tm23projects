Hi everyone.  I'm running the HB 1.2 with the expansion board.  I've
installed the 6500 ranging system and use servo ports 1 through 3.  I now
have two wheel encoders functioning and desire to use the IC encoder
routines.

My problem is that I've got the 6500 ranging unit plugged into PA0 and TIC2.
This leaves PA1 and TIC3.  Is TIC1 available somewhere?  Can I assign it to
one of the other digital inputs?  I'm using IC 3.2 and the encoders will run
on PA0 and PA1.  Is there a way to use the Leggo inputs for this?  Has
anyone else done it?

Thanks for your help.
