cappy,

did you use my new "6811 Downloader MCL" version?  this has been
tested on a variety of Macs running system 8.5 and 8.1.

please download it from

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/software/6811_Downloader_MCL.sit.hqx

let me know if this works to download from your 6500.

have you ever used the serial port on this 6500 before?  i remember
a lot of 6500's shipped with internal geoport modems, is yours one of
these?  then try to use the printer port; make sure appletalk is
turned off in the chooser.

please start your debug afresh with the new 6811 Downloader MCL version,
which is tested on contemporary macs running the latest OS versions.
then we can tell if it's a hardware/driver problem with your Mac or not.

fred
