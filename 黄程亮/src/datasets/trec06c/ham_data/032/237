I have the MTJPRO11 board by Mekatronix as well as the MIT HandyBoard
both use the 68HC11A1FN mcu. I am using hacked Sharp GP1U58 'tin can'
detectors so that they output analog voltage from 1.5 to 2.5 ( effective

proximity range is approximately 4" to 16" when using a 5ma current on
an uncollimated IR Emitter). The units work quite well with the MTJPRO11

using any of the PE0-7 analog inputs. They yield A/D values between 88
and 130 based on the proximity of an object within  4" - 16".

However, when I try them out on the HandyBoard's analog inputs they do
not work, all I get is an A/D value of approx 210 which does not change.

The only difference that I can see between the analog ports on the two
units is that the HandyBoard uses a 47k pull-up resistor on the input
pins of the PE port.

Any suggestions as to how I can use them with the HandyBoard will be
appreciated.

Thanks,
Ranjit
