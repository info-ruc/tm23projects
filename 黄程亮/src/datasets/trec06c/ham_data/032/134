Han ,
    I think you have a slight misunderstanding of the command fd(motor).  This
command means START running the motors, not continue running the motors.
When you hit the switch you need off(motor).  So:
 void main (void)
    {
      fd (0);
      fd (1); 
      printf("Hey, you look for power station?!");
      while (digital(7)==0) {   /* digital(7) input: bumper switch
                             connection with normal open contact   */
 /* Do some steering here */
       }
       off(0);
       off(1);
    }
 
 or in place of off(0) and off(1) you could just call alloff(); which turns
off all motors.  I dont know what you have motors 3 and 4 doing.

hope this helps
Pherd
