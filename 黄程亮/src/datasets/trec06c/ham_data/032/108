1.  yes, you probably killed your analog 5.  the analog inputs are
very sensitive to over voltage.  if your ran more than +5v directly
into the input, you probably killed it.

next time you're playing with funky voltages, put a 5K resistor in
series with the funky voltage and the analog input.  that should
protect it.

2.  you can't tell if the robot is stuck by looking at the system
battery, because (as you discovered!) it doesn't drop by much when the
robot is stuck.  one of the properties of nicads is that they can
supply tons of current w/o difficulty.

3.  there is a method to measure the voltage drop across the motor
driver chips.  this is a reasonable way to see if the motor is
stalled.  

this was implemented on the MIT 6.270 board.  see page 200 of the
appendix B document listed at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/techdocs/

all you have to do is look at the voltage at the point between the
motor LEDs and their 1K drop resistor.  use a 1K resistor between that
point and the analog input.

btw, this only works when you're running the motors at full speed.  if
you are using speed control, the readings get messed up.
