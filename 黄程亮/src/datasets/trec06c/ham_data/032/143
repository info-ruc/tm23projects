I understand that you can't use normal toy motors I just have two 
questions:

1. Can you construct circuitry to limit current and voltage draw to 
operate these.

2. Can you purchase 9v motors in the same physical diamensions as 
normal toy motors?

I purchased a motorized bulldozer for my base and It is quite large 
and would make an excellent base and I want to use this for my base
could you please help I wouldn't want to think i wasted my money.
