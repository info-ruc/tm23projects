If your code looks something like this...

if (i == 1) do001(); else
if (i == 2) do002(); else
if (i == 3) do003(); else
.
.
.
if (i == 100) do100();

...then try changing it to this:

/* Not really a loop, just so we can break */

for (;;) {
    if (i == 1) {
        do001();
        break;
    }
    if (i == 2) {
        do002();
        break;
    }
    if (i == 3) {
        do003();
        break;
    }
    .
    .
    .
    if (i == 100) {
        do100();
        break;
    }

    break;  /* Always break... this isn't really a loop */
}


...this won't be any less efficient and should resolve your compile-time stack
overflow as it doesn't nest the IF statements.
