	Too much current (and voltage) for those original
Polaroid motors, which are 6-volt.

	I have done the 6.270 piggyback hack with the motor
driver chips from Handy Boards I got from Gleason Research.
This works fine.  In fact, piggybacked motor driver chips from
my 6.270 boards work fine in the Handy Board.  In fact, I
was about to suggest to Wanda Gleason that this "hack" be
made a purchasable option.  Of course, since the Handy Board
is designed to be a 1-battery system, if you have motors
which use too much current, the internal battery won't last
long...so in conjunction with this, I have started to
modify my Handy Boards to take an external motor battery
(there is an input jack, you have to cut a trace on the board,
see the Handy Board FAQ for details; I have put a switch
across the cut so I can go back to the all-in-one configuration
if needed).  In general, I prefer the 6.270 battery arrangement:
it's easier to swap in fresh cells and recharge later than have
to wait for the internal battery to recharge--the latter is not
an option in a contest situation where your operating time may
be an hour or more (as we do with our 6.270-based Egg Hunt).
Of course, your mileage may vary.

	If you do the modification to accept an external motor
battery, you can keep using the 6-volt Polaroid motors you have.
I may be looking in the wrong places, but I see more 3-6 V motors
around than 9 V motors.
