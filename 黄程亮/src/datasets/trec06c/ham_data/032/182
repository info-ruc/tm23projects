Hi,
Currently, I'm using a infra-sensor with supply by 12v external source
battery.The signal line wire is plug directly into the HD digital or analog
port. The positive and negative supply of this infra-sensor is connected to
the external supply 12V. There is no linking back of the ground  to the HD.

Question : Do I need to step down the voltage from 12v to 5V on the signal
line before plug directly into the HD analog or digital port ?

rgds,
phillip chia
