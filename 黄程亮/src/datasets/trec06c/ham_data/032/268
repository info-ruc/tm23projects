Is anyone using a compiler other than Interactive C? I like IC but want to =
get a bit closer to the metal. Being able to use a source level debugger =
would also be good.

I've tried the Introl C compiler demo, and the it looks really good, but =
it seems to make assumptions about the location of the interrupt vectors =
(such as reset).=20

Has anyone written libraries for the HB for use with any other compiler?
