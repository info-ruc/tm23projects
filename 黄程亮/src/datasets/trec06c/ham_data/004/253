SERTS Rocket Flight - set for launch on 18 Nov. 1997

Date: Wed, 12 Nov 1997 16:37:59 -0500
From: "Roger J. Thomas, NASA/GSFC" <THOMAS@jet.gsfc.nasa.gov>
Subject: SERTS-97 Flight

The SERTS rocket experiment will be flown again from White Sands Missile Range
on Tuesday, 1997 November 18, with a 15-minute launch window starting at 1935UT
(chosen to allow SERTS observations while Yohkoh was in sunlight, and within 1
hour of local solar noon at White Sands M.R.).  A primary objective for this flight will be
to provide radiometric and wavelength calibrations for several instruments
aboard the SOHO satellite mission, as described below. 


SERTS-97 OBJECTIVES FOR SOHO:
--------------------------
  1. CDS radiometric and wavelength cross-calibration using the SERTS rocket.
  2. EIT and CELIAS/SEM radiometric cross-calibration.
  3. Determination of EIT 304A channel spectral composition.


DESCRIPTION OF THE SERTS-97 EXPERIMENT:
---------------------------------------

The GSFC Solar EUV Rocket Telescope and Spectrograph (SERTS) is scheduled for
flight on 1997 November 18, with a principal objective of providing radiometric
and wavelength calibrations for several experiments on the Solar and
Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) satellite mission.  SERTS provides imaged EUV
spectra and spectroheliograms of selected areas on the sun.  For the '97
flight, it will be configured to observe the wavelength interval 298-355A with
an intensified CCD detector and multilayer-coated grating.  It will
simultaneously record high resolution spectra over a spatial area of
7x360arcsec, and spectroheliograms of two regions 3x8.5arcmin in size.  An
end-to-end radiometric calibration of the rocket instrument was carried out at
Rutherford-Appleton Lab in the same facility used to characterize the CDS
experiment on SOHO, and using the same EUV light source recently re-calibrated
by PTB against the BESSY synchrotron. 

The payload will also include a full-sun EUV monitor provided by the University
of Southern California.  This device was recently calibrated at the NIST
SURF-II synchrotron, and is equivalent to the middle channel of the CELIAS/SEM
instrument now flying aboard SOHO.  Its measurements will provide a direct
update to the radiometric calibration of CELIAS, and a check on the atmospheric
extinction models used for correcting the primary SERTS data. 


Operating Details:
------------------
Detailed observing plans are being developed.  Following are some preliminary
considerations for various instruments involved in this project.

  SERTS: Launch is scheduled for 1935UT on 1997 Nov 18, with a window of
15 min.  This allows SERTS observations within 1-hour of local solar noon at 
WSMR, while YOHKOH is also in sunlight.  Observations of Target 1 occur from 
T+102sec to T+165sec.  The rocket then slews to the second pointing position, 
and observations of Target 2 occur from T+170sec to T+500sec.  The baseline 
objective for Target 2 is an active region near disk center (if available), 
with Target 1 positioned so that this active region falls within one of the 
SERTS lobes.  The slit will most likely be aligned to the solar rotation axis
with a pointing accuracy of +-10arcsec in X,Y and +-5deg in roll.

  CDS: Sixteen 25-pixel windows will be observed with the NIS, using the 
4x240arcsec slit and 30s exposures.  The number of observed CDS windows is
limited by the telemetry rate and need to have measurements co-temporal with
the brief SERTS flight.  To assure FOV overlap, 30 raster steps of 4-arcsec
each will be made covering a total area of 120x240arcsec centered on Target 2. 
The observed lines include: He II 304, Mg VIII 315, Si VIII 316, Si VIII 320,
Fe XV 327, Cr XIII 328, Al X 332, Fe XIV 334, Fe XVI 335, Fe XII 338, Mg VIII
339, Fe XI 341, Si IX 342, Si IX 345, Si X 347, Si IX 350, Fe XII 352, Fe XI
353, and Fe XIV 354.  (He II 304 is seen by NIS2 in second order.) This full
sequence takes approximately 500sec; it will be run at least 3 times: before,
during, and after the SERTS flight. 

  EIT: Full disk images will be used before the SERTS flight for targeting, and
after the flight for context information.  During the flight, emphasis will be
on the target regions and in particular on Target 2. 

  MDI: Magnetograms will be made of the SERTS target fields during the flight. 
The high-resolution mode will be used if selected SERTS targets overlap the
MDI-HR field of view.

  CELIAS: Measurements will be made of the integrated 304A solar flux during
the flight with the Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor. 


We invite ALL observers to participate with collaborative observations. 
Spectroscopic data obtained during the SERTS flight will be provided for
collaborative work upon request.     Dr. Joseph Davila & Dr. Roger J. Thomas

   SPARTAN 201 EXPERIMENT ON SHUTTLE MISSION STS-87
   Launch date 19 November 1997

   Date: Thu, 13 Nov 1997 22:08:02 -0500
   From: Leonard Strachan <strachan@wuzza.harvard.edu>

         
SPARTAN 201 is making its fourth flight this time on the shuttle Columbia 
(Mission STS-87) which is scheduled to launch on 19 November 1997. The payload
for SPARTAN Mission 201-4 consists of a White Light Coronagraph (WLC) provided
by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and an Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer 
(UVCS) provided by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.  SPARTAN 201,
which is deployed and retrieved by the space shuttle is expected to carry
out 43 hours of solar coronal observations.  

The SPARTAN 201 will be carried into orbit by the space shuttle on Mission
STS-87 which has a launch date scheduled for 19 November 1997, 19:46 UT. SP201
will be deployed on 20 November 21:01 UT and retrieved on 22 November 15:15 UT.
The duration of the SPARTAN flight is almost two days (43.5 hours).
Deployment is planned to occur at 1 day, 1 hr., 15 min. after launch, 
or at 21:01 UT on 20 November, for an ontime launch.Primary
targets are the north polar hole and the streamer belt surrounding the polar
coronal holes.  

The primary goal of the SPARTAN 201-4 mission is to study the physical
properties of the corona and to update the absolute radiometric calibrations
for two of the coronagraphs on the current ESA/NASA Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft.  Intercalibration observations are planned
for SOHO/UVCS and SOHO/LASCO. The SPARTAN instruments are designed to
characterize the plasma conditions of the extended corona by determining 
values for electron densities; proton thermal and nonthermal random velocity
distributions, densities, and bulk flow velocities.  Densities and outflow
velocities of O5+ and Fe11+ can be determined as well.

The White Light Coronagraph determines the distributions of electron density
from polarized radiance and absolute radiance observations of closed and open
magnetic structures between 1.25 and 6 solar radii from sun center. The WLC is
the most recent version of the space-borne externally occulted Lyot
coronagraph, whose predecessors include experiments flown by HAO on balloons,
the Skylab Apollo Telescope Mount, sounding rockets, and the Solar Maximum
Mission.  WLC uses a rotating half-wave plate, a linear polarizer, a serrated
occulting disk for occulting the disk at 1.25 solar radius, and a linear, wide
dynamic range detector CCD camera to measure the intensity and polarization
of broad band visible coronal radiation.  Observations out to 6 solar radii from
sun-center will be obtained within a sector of 60 degrees in width centered
on the UVC radial scan capability.

The Ultraviolet Coronal Spectrometer will measure profiles and intensities of 
H I Ly-alpha and intensities of O VI 1032/1037 and Fe XII 1242 at heliocentric
heights from 1.25 to 3.5 solar radii from sun center.  

Coordinates for the targets will be announced 28 hours before deployment.  Updates of the
coordinates may be issued at 12 and possibly 8 hours prior to deployment.
Once deployed, SPARTAN automatically executes the pre-programmed maneuvers on
each target.  The current primary targets for this flight are the
north polar hole and streamers on the east and west limbs.  The location of
the fourth target will probably be in the south coronal hole.  Space-based
observations from instruments on SOHO and Yohkoh will be used to identify
transient activity as late as 8 hours prior to deployment.

Additional supporting observations:
 
Prominence monitors, coronagraphs, and interplanetary scintillation arrays
can provide useful correlative measurements of temperature, density and
velocity diagnostics of the lower and upper corona.  In particular, synoptic
observations of coronal and photospheric/chromospheric features  FOR ONE WEEK
BEFORE AND AFTER the flight will be very useful in determining the three
dimensional structure of the coronal features.  Magnetic and
H-alpha observations are useful in determining large-scale magnetic field
patterns. During the first flight, the WLC observed several 
polar plumes/rays in both the south and the north polar
coronal holes extending all the way to 6 solar radii.  Disk or limb
observations that aid in identifying the origins of such rays would be
extremely useful.  Ca K-line observations of network features are valuable as
well. For the first three flights, collaborative observations 
included those from Yohkoh, Mauna Loa Solar Observatory, the
National Solar Observatories, the Very Large Array radio telescope, the
EISCAT observatory, and other ground based observatories.  Now that SOHO is
in operation, coordinated observations are planned for several of the solar
and coronal instruments.  World-wide participation will help provide 24 hour/day
collaborative observations for the upcoming mission.  With simultaneous,
multiwavelength observations, we hope to obtain as complete as possible a
description of the coronal regions where coronal heating and acceleration of
the solar wind is believed to take place. 


A tentative timeline showing actual times and true position angles will be
made available on 18 November 1997, two days prior to the SPARTAN deployment.
A FINAL timeline of the SPARTAN observations will be sent out with minor
changes on the day of SPARTAN deployment.
