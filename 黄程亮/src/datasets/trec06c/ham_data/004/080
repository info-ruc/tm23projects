                        Preliminary Call for Papers
                                WAIT'97
        First Argentine Workshop on Theoretical Informatics
                        Buenos Aires, Argentina
                             August 11,1997

The workshop will take place as part of a bigger event, JAIIO'97, the 26th
International Conference of the Argentine Computer Science and Operational
Research Society (SADIO), and jointly with other symposia and tutorials
organized by the VLDB Foundation.

The aim of the workshop is to bring together academic and industrial researchers
>From Argentina, South-America and the rest of the world to discuss theoretical,
empirical and experimental results in the field of Theoretical Computer Science.

The workshop will include invited talks and submitted works.
Typical areas include (but are not limited to): Automata, Algorithms and Data
Structures (sequential, parallel, distributed, on-line, probabilistic, etc.),
Computational Complexity, Graphs, Symbolic and Algebraic Computation,
Combinatorial and Algebraic Aspects of Computer Science and in general all
subjects related to Computational Models.

We invite to submit papers on any topic of Theoretical Computer Science. We
solicit different classes of contributions, ranging from research papers to
ongoing R+D projects from either academic or industrial organizations.

Submissions will be reviewed by an International Program Committee for the
criteria appropriate to their category:

* Research/Experience Papers: Submissions on these categories will be reviewed
for significance and originality. Extended abstracts or full long papers are
required for submission deadline. Extended abstracts up to 4 pages
long, giving enough detail to allow reviewers an understanding of the
final paper, are requested. Full papers up to 12 pages long (including
abstract, figures and references) can also be submitted.

* Research Projects: With the goal of stimulating the knowledge and
cooperation between national and regional research groups, we solicit
short papers describing ongoing research projects. Originality is not
required for this category (in this case, an explicit reference to where the
work has been previously published or submitted must be given).

* Industrial/Commercial Paper: WAIT'97 focuses also on experiences applying
theoretical tools to real-life situations. We then encourage submission of short
papers describing significant results for the industry by using novel and
challenging applications of theoretical results.


SUBMISSION INFORMATION:

In order to enable a wide distribution of the papers, authors are encouraged to
submit extended abstracts or short papers in English, although submissions in
Spanish or Portuguese will also be considered.

Papers must be submitted before May 16, 1997 in ghostview-readable
PostScript format by e-mail to:
                                wait97@dc.uba.ar.

In addition, please send an ASCII file to the same address including the
following information: work title, complete affiliation, e-mail address,
telephone and FAX number of each author, abstract of the paper (up to 10
lines), a list of keywords describing the work, and the most likely category to
be considered.

Other forms of submission may be also considered, please contact the workshop
co-chairs by e-mail for further information.

The complete format for the camera-ready copy will be informed together with
the acceptance letter.
