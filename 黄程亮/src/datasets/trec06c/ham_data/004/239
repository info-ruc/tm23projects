Dear AFS Contacts --

I am writing to update you regarding several AFS problems that are
being worked jointly by Transarc and HP.  There are currently three
outstanding issues that are related to the "kload" program which HP
has distributed in the past.

The issues are:

1) HP discontinued support for "kload" in Q1 '97.  The HP-UX DFS 1.5.1
release does not include a "kload" program.  However, the HP-UX DFS
1.5.1 Release Notes state that customers who need to dynamically load
AFS with DFS 1.5.1 should contact Transarc to obtain a new version of
"kload".

This information is unfortunately incorrect.  Transarc does not
support or maintain a new version of HP's "kload" program and there
are no plans to do so.

2) AFS 3.4a (patch level 5.28 and lower) and DFS (all versions) cannot
be built into the kernel simultaneously because of symbol conflicts.

Transarc has fixed the symbol conflict problem and a patch will be
included in the upcoming patches release (Q4 '97 - official date to be
announced).  For your reference, the corresponding defect number for
this patch is 8824 and it was imported into the 5.33 build of AFS
3.4a.

3) HP-UX 10.20 patches PHKL_9273 and PHKL_9274 for HP700 and HP800
systems (and any HP patches that would supercede these) are
incompatible with dynamic loading of AFS using "kload".

IMPORTANT NOTICE FOLLOWS:
=========================

We regret we must announce that effective immediately, dynamic loading
of AFS on HP-UX 10.x will no longer be supported by Transarc.  This is
a result of HP's decision to no longer distribute and support "kload"
and Transarc's determination that there is not a suitable workaround
other than to discontinue support for dynamic loading on HP-UX 10.x.
Therefore, Transarc will only support AFS on HP-UX 10.x systems if AFS
has been statically built into the kernel.

For customers who currently need to install HP DFS 1.5.1 (before the
AFS patch release is available), please contact AFS Customer Support
for an early release of the patch which resolves the symbol conflicts.

As always, please contact AFS Customer Support at
<afshelp@transarc.com> or 412-281-5852 if there are questions.
