               SECOND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON

                    COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

                           (RECOMB 98)



                      March 22 - 25, 1998
                         New York City



                           Sponsored by

                 Association for Computing Machinery

                              SIGACT

                         with support from

                         SLOAN Foundation
                      US Department of Energy

          http://www.mssm.edu/biomath/recomb98.html

The Second Annual Conference on Research in Computational Molecular Biology
(RECOMB 98),sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery Special
Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (ACM-SIGACT) with
support from the SLOAN Foundation, and US Department of Energy will be held in
New York City,  March 22 - 25, 1998. Papers reporting on original
research (both theoretical and experimental) in all areas of computational
molecular biology are sought, including surveys of important recent
results/directions. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest include:

- Genomics
- Molecular sequence analysis
- Recognition of  genes and regulatory elements
- Molecular evolution
- Protein structure
- Combinatorial libraries and drug design


ABSTRACT SUBMISSION: Authors are requested to send 10 copies
(preferably two sided copies) of a detailed extended abstract (5-10 pages) to:


                        Professor Pavel Pevzner
                        RECOMB 98 Program Chair
                        University of Southern California
                        Department of Mathematics, DRB 155
                        Los Angeles, CA 90089-1113


An abstract must be received by October 20, 1997.
This is a firm deadline. Simultaneous submission to another conference or
journal is allowed.

CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS:
The extended abstracts for the Conference will be published by ACM Press
and will be available at the Conference.
A selection of the accepted extended abstracts in their final journal
versions will be invited to appear in a special issue of the Journal of
Computational Biology devoted to RECOMB 98.


NOTIFICATION:
The conference submissions will be refereed by the program committee.
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by a letter mailed on
or before December 15, 1997.  A final copy of each accepted paper is
required by January 10, 1997. An author of each accepted paper is expected
to attend the Symposium and present the paper; otherwise alternative
arrangements should be made to have the paper presented.



ABSTRACT PREPARATION:
An abstract should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the
results achieved, their significance and a comparison with previous
work. This material should be understandable to nonspecialists. A
technical exposition directed to the specialist should follow. The
length, excluding cover page and bibliography, should not exceed 10
pages.  The manuscript should be easy to read, preferably using 11 point
font size on U.S. standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper.  If authors believe
that more details are necessary to substantiate the claims of the
paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix.
An E-mail address for the contact author should be included.


              Conference Events

RECOMB 98 will feature 8 invited lectures (to be announced later) by prominent
biologists including the following conference events:


THE  STANISLAW ULAM MEMORIAL COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY ADDRESS.
The  Stanislaw Ulam Memorial Lecture awarded by RECOMB to
a scientist who has made major contributions in the
computational aspects of the field.

THE DISTINGUISHED CONFERENCE LECTURE.
The conference will start with the Distinguished Conference Lecture
awarded by RECOMB to a scientist who has made major contributions in the
biological aspects of the field.

THE DISTINGUISHED NEW TECHNOLOGIES LECTURE.
A lecture describing emerging, new technologies.

BEST PAPER BY A YOUNG SCIENTIST AWARD.
This award will be given to the best paper
written solely by one or more recent graduates or students.
An abstract is eligible if all
authors are recent graduates (within 2 years from Ph.D.) or
full-time students at the time of submission. This should
be indicated in the submission letter. The program committee may
decline to make the award or may split it among several papers.
