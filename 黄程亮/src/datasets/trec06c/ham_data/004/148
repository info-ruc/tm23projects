          DIMACS Workshop on Massive Data Sets in Telecommunications

                         CoRE Building, Busch Campus
                             Rutgers University
                               Piscataway, NJ

                             October 13-15, 1997



The emergence of the computer as an essential tool in scientific
research and as an essential ingredient in commercial systems has led
to the generation of massive amounts of data.  These data sets are of
critical importance for a broad variety of scientific and
technological applications, including but not limited to astronomy,
biology, medicine, ecological monitoring and weather prediction,
information retrieval, and telecommunications.  To help focus research
activity on the daunting computational and mathematical problems of
organizing and using these data, DIMACS is conducting a Special Year
on Massive Data Sets in 1997-98.

Telecommunications systems pose some of the most challenging massive
data set problems and present many opportunities for researchers in
the mathematical sciences.  Sources of data include switch-generated
call-detail records, customer billing records, customer service-call
records, IP headers, and WWW ``click streams.''  Uses and potential
uses of data include network operations and management, billing, fraud
detection, quality control, marketing, information retrieval, and law
enforcement.  Many classical algorithmic and mathematical problems are
relevant, including clustering, compression, error-detection and -correction,
nearest-neighbor searching, and shortest-path and connectivity computations.
Note that some types of data are obviously proprietary and sensitive and
that the ``privacy status'' and ``ownership status'' of others is currently
the subject of policy debate.  Thus there is a pressing need for both
technical mechanisms and social policies that support privacy protection
without destroying the usefulness of data sets.

DIMACS will hold a Special Year workshop on all aspects of massive
data sets in telecommunications systems on October 13-15, 1997.  If
you would like to attend the workshop, please contact Pat Pravato at
the DIMACS center: pravato@dimacs.rutgers.edu, 732-445-5930.

Presentations are solicited on all aspects of massive data sets that
are relevant to telecommunications systems, including but not limited
to the mathematical, algorithmic, infrastructural, application, and
policy aspects mentioned above.  If you would like to give a talk or
a demo, please send an abstract of your proposed presentation (at most
one page in length) to the workshop chair:

                             Joan Feigenbaum
                             jf@research.att.com
                             973-360-8442 (phone)
                             973-360-8178 (fax)
                             http://www.research.att.com/~jf

The deadline for submissions is August 15, 1997.

The workshop will be informal, and there will be no published proceedings.
You are encouraged to submit an abstract on any material that you think would
be of interest to the participants, including material that has been or will
be published elsewhere.  A limited amount of travel support is available for
participants who can demonstrate need and who apply early.  Please contact the
workshop chair if you would like to apply for travel money.

The Special Year program is made possible by long term funding from the
National Science Foundation, the New Jersey Commission on Science and
Technology and DIMACS university and industry partners.
