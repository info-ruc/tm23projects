This directory contains the templates of Kinney, Calzetti, Bohlin, McQuade, 
Storchi-Bergmann and Schmitt (1996, ApJ, in press), as well as the individual
galaxies spectra. 

The 12 templates are contained in 12 separate ASCII files, and each file 
contains 3 columns: 
1) the wavelength in angstroms,
2) the average flux in units of erg cm^-2 s^-1 A^-1 
3) the standard deviation on the flux, also in units of erg cm^-2 s^-1 A^-1.

The name of the file identifies the template as follows:

SB1 = Starbursts with E(B-V) < 0.10
SB2 = Starbursts with  0.11 < E(B-V) < 0.21
SB3 = Starbursts with  0.25 < E(B-V) < 0.35
SB4 = Starbursts with  0.39 < E(B-V) < 0.50
SB5 = Starbursts with  0.51 < E(B-V) < 0.60
SB6 = Starbursts with  0.61 < E(B-V) < 0.70
S0  = S0 galaxies template
Sa  = Sa galaxies template
Sb  = Sb galaxies template
Sc  = Sc galaxies template
bulge = bulges template
ellipticals = ellipticals template

For the individual galaxies spectra, the files begin with the name of the
galaxy followed by the extension .txt. These spectra are in units of
erg cm^-2 s^-1 A^-1, have initial wavelength 1100A and wavelength bin 1.5A.
Note that the individual spectra are in the observed frame, while the
templates are in the rest frame.
