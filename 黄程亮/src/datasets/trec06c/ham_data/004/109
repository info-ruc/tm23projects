hi all,
here are the minutes for the projects sub-commitee meeting held at
anuraag's place on june 10, 1996. i  am sending this to asha-tamasha so
that everyone is aware of the discussions that are going on related to the
projects.

attendees: anuraag, ravi, meera, ashwin, rajaram, mita, niranjan, srinivas,
shailaja, guruvinder.

1. it was decided that since asha has almost $8000 lying unallocated
presently, new projects must be picked for funding, or alternatively
funding for our current projects must be increased.

2. in this regard, it decided that asha-rtp can support at the most 4
projects, including the ones we currently fund. this would mean that asha's
annual commitment to projects would be of the order of $4,000-5,000.

3. asha will keep about $2000 as working capital for expenses such as
fundraisers.

4. a semi annual report prepared for asha-rtp by khajurdaha nabankur united
club in west bengal was tabled. we decided that semi-annual project reports
are a must and will be a part of our requirements for future funding.

5. projects where we have contacts or which can be easily visited will be
given preference for future funding. in addition, an effort will be made
towards supporting grass-roots projects especially in smaller cities and
villages.

6. in this regard, some of the projects which were suggested are:
(A) an orphanage/ashram based in trivandrum- meera and ravi visited this
place on their last trip to india and were sufficiently impressed by the
work being undertaken with underpriveledged children.
(B) udavam karangal, based in madras- suggested by rajaram, who has visited
this site.
(C) a school to be set up in vir village in konkan district of maharashtra-
suggested by anu, who recently visited the site.
(D) greater funding to rishi valley foundation, for some new projects that
are planning to embark upon.

more information is being requested on all these projects. upon receiving
this information, another meeting will be called and the projects to be
funded will be finalised. if anyone elsi knows of other projects, please
let me know and we will try and get in touch with them to find out more
information.

thanks

anuraag
