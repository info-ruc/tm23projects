                            January 17-18, 1998

DEADLINES

    Submissions:        September 28, 1997
    Notifications:      November 10, 1997
    Final versions:     December 8, 1997


The search for sound foundations for object-oriented languages has driven a
variety of work in the theory of programming languages during the past decade,
leading to a better understanding of the key concepts of object-oriented
languages and to important developments in type theory, semantics, and
program verification.  The FOOL workshops bring together researchers to
share new ideas and results.

The next workshop, FOOL 5, will be held in January, 1998, in San Diego, the
two days preceding POPL98.

Submissions for this event are invited in the general area of theoretical
foundations of object-oriented languages, including semantics, calculi, type
theory, and program verification.  We also welcome contributions on
foundational issues related to concurrent and distributed object-oriented
languages and database languages with object-oriented features.  Since the
main focus in selecting workshop contributions will be the intrinsic
interest and timeliness of the work, authors are encouraged to submit
(polished) descriptions of work in progress as well as papers describing
completed projects.

A world-wide web page will be created and made available as an informal
electronic conference proceedings.  Notification of the acceptance or
rejection of papers will be given by Monday, November 10, 1997.  Final
copies of accepted papers for the electronic proceedings will be due on
December 8, 1997.

Correspondence and questions should be sent to Didier.Remy@inria.fr


SUBMISSION PROCEDURE

We solicit submissions on original research not previously published or
currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  Extended abstracts not to
exceed 2500 words (approximately 5 pages) should be submitted to the program
chair by Sunday, September 28, 1997.  Due to the relatively tight schedule
for refereeing we will not be able to consider late submissions.  Receipt of
the submissions will be acknowledged by e-mail.  The authors should inquire in
case a prompt acknowledgment is not received.

Electronic submission is preferred: documents in postscript format
(US-letter size) should be e-mailed to fool5@pauillac.inria.fr (If
electronic submission is impossible, please contact the program chair to
make special arrangements.)  The cover page should include a return postal
address, a telephone number, and an electronic mail address if possible.
