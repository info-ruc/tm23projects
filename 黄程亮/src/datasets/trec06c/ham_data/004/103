             Foundations of Artificial Intelligence

                         Focusing on
                        Intelligent Agents

                       June 16-18, 1997
            Bar-Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel

                      in cooperation with

To BISFAI'97 Prospective Participants
-------------------------------------

The focus of BISFAI'97 is on Intelligent Agents. The Symposium will,
however, retain its broad scope. It includes high quality research
papers in various areas of Artificial Intelligence, including machine
learning, automated reasoning, knowledge representation, neural nets,
and natural language processing, among others.

The Symposium is part of the new Israeli Federated Computing
Conference (IFCC). The IFCC also includes the Eighth Israeli
Conference on Computer-Based Systems and Software Engineering (CBSE),
sponsored by the "IEEE Computer Society, Israel Section", which will
be held June 18-19, and the Fifth Israeli Symposium on Theory of
Computing and Systems (ISTCS'97), which will be held June 17-19.
For details on this conference, see the Web page located at:
http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~mansour/istcs97/


BISFAI'97 Schedule Outline
--------------------------

The scientific program includes six invited speakers and 21
contributed papers reviewed and selected by the program committee.
Each one of the invited speakers has chosen a topic which is central
to his scientific work and interests over the years. With these
invited speakers and the mix of contributed papers, we expect to have
a highly interesting symposium.

The outline of the conference schedule is as follows:

Monday June 16:  Morning and afternoon sessions at Bar-Ilan University.

Monday evening:  Conference dinner in Jaffa.

Tuesday June 17: Morning and afternoon sessions at Bar-Ilan University.
                 (lunch and afternoon invited speaker shared with ISTCS.)
