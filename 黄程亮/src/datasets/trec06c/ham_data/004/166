There will be a three-week program on cryptology and security at
DIMACS, from July 27 through August 15.  In addition to typical
research talks, the schedule features many ``plenary'' talks aimed at
a general audience and many ``expository'' talks aimed at computer
scientists and mathematicians who are not specialists in cryptology
and security.  All members of the scientific community are welcome to
attend.  See

                http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/drei/1997

for more information.

This program is made possible with funding from the National Science
Foundation.
