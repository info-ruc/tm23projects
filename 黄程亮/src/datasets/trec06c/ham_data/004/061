In John Carmack's .plan (for March 18), the following snippet can be found.


Plan9
I spent a few months running Plan9.  It has an achingly elegent internal structure, but a user interface that has been asleep for the past decade.  I had an older version of quake dedicated server running on it (don't ask me for it -- I lost it somewhere) and I was writing a civilized window manager for it in my spare time, but my spare time turned out to be only a couple hours a month, and it just got prioritized out of existance.
