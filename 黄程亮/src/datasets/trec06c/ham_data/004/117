Subject: Line Separator Character

What is the deal with unicode line separator?  Why would I want to use it,
as opposed to using, say, LF or CRLF?  Microsoft's CF_UNICODETEXT clipboard
format apparently requires CRLF, and their notepad application displays
black blob characters when you feed it the Unicode line separator.  I've
heard reports that Java similarly misdisplays this character, prefering LF
only.  What was the idea behind Unicode line separator.  Is there any
advantage to using it?  It seems to be different just to be different.  If I
chose to use LF or CRLF, at least I'd be compatible with many things.  This
way I'm compatible with just about nothing.  Can anyone provide any further
information or insights?

I suppose that as the one who proposed the Unicode line separator, I should
speak to this one.  The following are statements from, or paraphrased from,
the Unicode standard:

 . Unicode encodes plain text;
 . Plain text should contain enough information to permit the text to be
   rendered legibly and nothing more;
 . The appearance of the text depends on an upper level protocol and not
   on ASCII or ISO control characters, which are retained only for
   compatibility.
 . Unicode does not prescribe specific semantics for U+000D (CR) and
   U+000A (LF); it is left the application to interpret these codes.

In other words, without Line Separator U+2028, there would be no canonical
way to represent line breaks, as in (e.g.) poetry, in Unicode plain text.
Why?  Because the semantics of CR, LF, CRLF, and other control characters
vary from platform to platform (e.g. Macintosh, UNIX, DOS).

Furthermore, the conventions for separating paragraphs are also platform
and application-specific.  Thus the Paragraph Separator, U+2029.

Does this mean that new applications should refrain from using LF and CR
and use the two new control characters instead? How many Unicode
applications currently understand the Unicode line and paragraph
separators? 

As for future Unicode apps what about Unicode supporting e-mail apps?
Will the upcoming Netscape Communicator (most popular commercial Unicode
capable e-mail client I can think of) send e-mail (and understand) with
the new markers (providing they're Unicode encoded, of course).
(targeted towards the Netscape/Unicode group)

Why should we use a new Unicode special character for line separator
when there is a line separator control character: NL (Next Line) defined
in the 0200-0237 range. It would be better to to use that instead of CR/LF and
U+2028. It can also be used in 8-bit byte text.

I'm aware of this. Allow me to clarify: encode the Unicode line and
paragraph separators in UTF-7 and transmit no CR and LFs. Some
protocols, such as SMTP, have a line limit (998 octets in the case of
SMTP).

However, as the behavior of CR and LF is system dependent, an e-mail
client could theoretically ignore CR LF, etc and go by the UTF-7 encoded
Unicode line and paragraph breaks, when 

RFC2046 says '[i]t should not be necessary to add any line breaks to
display "text/plain" correctly....' So why not NOT use them and go with
the Unicode ones? I admit, I am not clear as to whether this phrase was
referring specifically to the ASCII CR and LF control characters, or was
referring to all types of line breaks in general. Is "plain text"
Unicode with Unicode line breaks considered to be "text/plain" or
"text/enriched" (which requires line breaks)?

As there are few legacy Unicode-capable e-mail clients, is it not
possible to push to get this functionality added now?

Many e-mail clients today have an option which enables them to
wrap/not-wrap long lines. Why not add a similar feature for Unicode
capable clients, which allows a selection (under the "Unicode section"
between "interpret CR and LF codes only", "interpret Unicode line and
paragraph breaks only", "interpret both Unicode line and paragraph
breaks AND CR and LF codes." (I'd also like a feature in future e-mail
clients that says "display Unrenderable Unicode as...")

Or am I overlooking something painfully obvious and being obtuse? If so,
my apologies for wasting everybody's time. ;-)

I can see how adding this kind of functionality might confuse the
average end-user. But the current end-user which now has to deal with
such cryptic functions such as "encode using MIME quoted-printable" or
"8-bit", so I don't see how this functionality could make e-mail clients
any more complicated, especially if the defaults are set for them for
Unicode.

Yet another reason why books like "The Complete Moron's Guide to E-Mail"
continue to sell, I guess. (^_^)

Well, general use i octal if leading zero, hex if leading 0x, U+ is not hex, also
octal is nicer.

Yes, but neither the lower nor the upper range of control chaarcters is defined
in ISO 10646, but both places are reserved for them, and there is a standard for
both the upper and lower range. If we are going to extend the use of
control characters it is better to use the control codes in the 8-bit range, especially
if it is something as important as line separator. Then it can be used in
many 8-bit character sets too. If is unfortunate that Mac, MS Win and UTF-8 have
decided to use the upper control space for other things.

U+ most assuredly is hex. Not only de facto, but now de jure. I
cite from DAM No. 9 to ISO/IEC 10646-1:1:

"The full syntax of the notation of a short identifier, in Backus-Naur form,
is:
	{U|u}[{+}xxxx|{-}xxxxxxxx]
where "x" represents one hexadecimal digit (0 to 9, A to F, or a to f),..."

And I concur with the respondent. Some may agree with you that "octal is
nicer", but on this list, octal will generally only confuse instead
of communicating.

By the way, octal 0200-0237, for those of you following this issue,
corresponds to U+0080 - U+009F, also known in ISO documents as the
C1 range, and referred to below as the "CR area". So what Dan is
suggesting is making use of C1 controls for linebreak control, instead
of U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR.

Use of C1 controls for 8-bit character sets is a logically separate
issue from use of U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR (and U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR)
in Unicode. You may consider it unfortunate, but it is reality that in a
world dominated by IBM, Microsoft, Apple, and even Hewlett-Packard
8-bit character encodings, most 8-bit data makes use of the 0x80..0x9F range
for graphic characters. Implementations of the ISO 8859 series are the
most notable exceptions.

And if you want to talk unfortunate, we wouldn't be having nearly
so many problems with the ISO 8-bit character sets if they had been
built in the first place with graphic characters in 0x80..0x9F (an
extra 32) instead of following an ill-conceived ISO 6937 attempt to
extend control functions through character encodings in that space.
For example, 8859-1 would have the French characters that are
currently missing in it, and 8859-2 would not have had to make the
ill-starred compromise between Romanian and Turkish letters!

The discription of LINE SEPARATOR and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR should be
clear from the discussions on page 6-72 in The Unicode Standard, Version
2.0.

Anyone using The Unicode Standard, Version 1.0 should "upgrade" to
Version 2.0. The full current state of the standard is established by
that document, supplemented by the Errata information on the Unicode web
site (http://unicode.org).

(By the way, there is also a listing of the table of contents on the web

>From the Unicode Standard, Version 2.0, p 6-72:

"[discussion of paragraph separator...]
A line separator indicates that a line-break should occur at this
point; although the text continues on the next line, it does not
start a new paragraph: no interparagraph line spacing nor paragraphic
indentation is applied. Since these are separator codes, it is not 
necessary to start the first line or paragraph, nor end the last line

In other words, a U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR is to Unicode plain text
formatting approximately as ";" is to Pascal statement syntax.

No mechanical background is intended or implied. This is one reason
to depart from the CR/LF/NL control code legacy. The Unicode
LINE SEPARATOR implies a GUI model of text layout and formatting
(although it is possible to implement on a terminal or virtual
terminal).

It is the minimum information to encode in plain text to make it
possible for a formatter (which is at a higher level abstraction,
and which, indeed, has notions of margins, line advance, etc.)
requires to render lines and paragraph breaks at appropriate
places.

While no one wants to encode all kinds of formatting details
in plain text (it belongs in rich or fancy text protocols),
neither does anyone want "plain text" to just be a completely
unstructured stream of characters with no expressed or expressable
chunking into lines and paragraphs.

Yes. But implementation pressure to keep using CR, LF, or CRLF in their
Unicode forms in plain text may result in other outcomes. Cf. Murray's

Although such usage has long been archaic, replaced by clean communication
protocols that transmit arbitrary binary data, or by full-blown device
control languages implemented in plain text (e.g. PostScript). But of
course "archaic" does not mean obsolete, since no computer communication
protocol ever seems to go away. ...Well, maybe paper tape punchcodes.

Yep. Note that the only C0 control character with an assumed and
required semantics in Unicode 2.0 is U+0009 TAB. Nobody implements
a TAB *character* with other than 0x09, and it seemed superfluous
to clone one. U+0009 TAB is referenced in the normative Unicode
bidi algorithm.

Exactly. The C1 control set is largely ignored, as far as I can tell.

I disagree with the implication of this. Unicode is emphatically intended
as an interchange code (as well as an internal encoding, or processing
code). It is just not designed to be consistent with
C0/byte-oriented transmission protocols. It is an interchange code for
plain text, in much the same way that GIF is an interchange code for
graphics. I don't much care what layers of other transmission and
communication protocols are involved in packing it up and delivering
it down the wire, as long as it arrives with the same content that
it left with.

Yes, but could this list be used to get practical advice on implementation
and on interpreting what the spec means in the real world?

OK, so Unicode recommends LINE SEPARATOR (LS) with the clear description
alluded to above.

And let's say Java AWT does not handle LS.  (That's more or less the report
I'm getting, but let's consider this hypothetical for now.)  

Can we then conclude that Java AWT is actually not Unicode compliant?  

That is, it does handle line separation, but does not assign this semantics
to the appropriate character.  

I.e., if Java AWT printed black blobs for LF and for LS, meaning that it
just can't understand the concept of line breaking, that would be
technically Unicode compliant, I guess.  

But if it actually can do line breaking, but but doesn't do it for LS, then
that's non-compliant.   Is that correct?

   No, but U+2029 PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR ("PS") is.  I.e., the PS character
should be the normally occurring character to indicate a new paragraph.
The LINE SEPARATOR is intended only for *rare* occasions where a new
line
is strongly(?) advised, such as within a poetic verse, or saying "it is
good place to break the line here, but don't start a new paragraph".
(This is similar to a soft hyphen.)  I don't know how strong the advice
is, since it says "line-break should...", not "line-break shall...".

   If in an HTML-document, I would guess that a U+2029 PARAGRAPH
SEPARATOR
should be interpreted *exactly* as a <p>, and a U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR
should be interpreted as a <br>.  Maybe the strength of the advice
to break should differ between <br> (always break) and LS (perhaps:
break here, if a break is needed and no better place is found),
I don't know.

   I make no argument as to the good- or ill-advisedness of having
these characters.  I just note that they are there, and may (or
should) be used.  Also, Unicode is going to be used with "higher level
'protocols'" (such as HTML), and a clarification of the interpretation
of the PS and LS characters in such contexts is needed, perhaps
exemplified with HTML.  (Note that HTML does NOT interpret NL or CR
as indicating any kind of line break, except in special circumstances
(<pre>).)

One can argue the merits and tradeoffs of older and newer protocols, but many
of the older ones were quite successful and continue to be by virtue of the
fact that they were unleashed only after a great deal of thought, and often
only after compromise and concensus among diverse groups with conflicting
interests.

I would be very happy if words like "archaic" and "legacy" were dropped from
the lexicon of serious people for use in describing existing practice, and
especially existing practice that conforms to hard-fought and hard-won
national and international standards such as ISO 2022, 8859, or even the early
ANSI standards specifying the use of control characters in communications
protocols, which forms the basis for many of our modern protocols.

These are emotionally-toned marketing terms used by greedy corporations that
want to shame you into discarding systems that work perfectly well and buy new
replacements from them.  Maybe new stuff has its advantages, but personally I
don't think that applying epithets to old stuff is the right way to point that
out.  (This is not directed at Ken -- I'm just airing one of my pet peeves.)

Speaking of which, on the other end of the spectrum is the profligate use of
the word "comply", which once carried some weight because it was used in
connection with the aforementioned hard-won standards, but now is used with
any three-letter acronym that any company can dream up on its own without any
sort of review, quality control, or concensus.

My goodness, nowadays we even have to "comply" with a year!

RFC 2070 has some explanation on some of the "control"-like
characters in Unicode. The main aim when working on RFC 2070
was to assure that some basic quality of display could be
achieved for a wide range of languages, and that where possible,
things could be brought in alignement with Unicode.

Because HTML is not plain text, but plain text with markup,
there are two layers. The first is what you see in a raw text
editor (you see the markup). There are line breaks there,
but to be consistent with the rest of HTML around (according
to the reference processing model explained in RFC 2070),
these have to be CR, LF, or CRLF. As explained above,
<p> and <br> are already here for the second level (what
you see in a browser). So the above two characters never
actually came into play. If there is a need for specification,
it would only be preemptive (avoid that different people
start to use it for different purposes). There is no place
where they currently would be needed.

That was different for other things, such as SHY (where we
made a recommendation in a Note) and all the "control"
characters needed for BIDI and joining (which are very
instrumental for certain languages and scripts).

Any comments wellcome.

Actually, the description of LINE SEPARATOR doesn't seem to state
explicitly whether it means "just advance to the next line" or "both
advance to the next line *and* return to the beginning of the line":

>From p. 6-72:
"A line separator indicates that a line-break should occur at this
point; although the text continues on the next line, it does not start a
new paragraph: no inter-paragraph line spacing nor paragraphic
indentation is applied."

I assume that "continues on the next line," implies "continues at the
beginning of the next line". That's what the expression "line-break"
means to me, but I'm not completely sure that it *has* to have that
meaning, and that everyone knows that it has that meaning and no other.

It probably ought to be stated explicitly since the question of implied
CR is answered differently by unix (LF implies CR) and DOS/Win (LF has a
CR welded to it, at least implying that LF by itself wouldn't return to
the beginning of the following line.) On old line printers, I had no
trouble linefeeding without returning to the beginning of the line,
though I've long since forgotten the char used to do so (I was but a
child.) ;-)

This may just be a nit, but while I'm at it, the definition of the PS
includes "this *could* cause, *for example*,..." [emphasis mine.]

That sounds as though the PS could just as easily "cause, for example"
something else, so maybe the specific behavior of the LS is also "left
as an exercise for the reader." Perhaps it *could* include an implied CR
in one implementation and not in another, both conforming to the
standard.

What was the actual intent?

I'll try one more time.

U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR indicates the separation of lines.

A formatter of Unicode plain text then does with the
separated lines what it will do with separated lines.

It is not intended to be abstruse.

And it should not be considered in the same context as
the complexity caused by the intermingling of device
control semantics of CR and LF (which after all came from
the world of *physical* TTY platen and print head control)
and the text formatting semantics of CR, LF, and/or CRLF in
Mac, Unix, and/or the DOS/Win worlds as EOL, EOP, newline,
and/or line separators. It is precisely because CR and LF
are such a mess that Unicode has a LINE SEPARATOR and
a PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR distinctly encoded.

Line Separator and Paragraph Separator are essential for
BIDI.  Paragraph Separator delimits the maximum scope
of text that the BIDI algorithm must consider all at once
(roughly stated: even if the line width is infinite, paragraphs
are still stacked top to bottom, so there is no need to reverse
any text across a paragraph mark).  Line Separator also
significantly affects BIDI behavior.

That said, I think that the suggestion that LS = <BR> and PS = <P>
is very sensible, and BIDI HTML renderers should be licensed to
treat <P> as PS and <BR> as LS for BIDI purposes.  (This would be
a "higher-level protocol" within the meaning of Unicode 2.0.)

Subject: Re: Line Separator Character


Context: plain text unicode file.

Assuming we use LS to separate lines (I guess there's no answer to the
question "what should I use"), then doesn't that interact negatively
with bidi markup, in particular embedding markups? Ie. I have to
reestablish the proper embedding level at each line.

Say I have two lines, some English with embedded Yiddish (levels shown
here, in logical order):
    000 0000 00 00000 RLE 11 1111 NL    |    English RLE Yiddish NL
    11 11111 1 11111 PDF 00 0000 ...    |    Yiddish PDF English ...

Now if the newline (NL in above) is indicated by a LS (\u2028), the
bidi state is reset between the lines. If I now start the second line
with RLE (so as to say I'm reestablishing an embedding level), I can no
longer tell whether I have one embedded segment or two (with a 0-level
space between, where the LS is). Could be an issue if I later reformat
(reflow) this text (as I might want to do in an editor).

As a matter of fact, if the second line (after LS) starts with a strong
R2L character and I don't reissue RLE, won't the base level be set to 1?
This would put the following English at level 2 (not intended as the
English isn't embedded in the Yiddish here, but the other way around).

These problems go away if I use any combinations of CR/LF to indicate
newline.

Another question: does PS imply LS? Or would I end a paragraph with LS PS?
I presume it does.

Thanks in advance for any clarifications.

Pierre,

I'll let the bidi experts respond re the first part of your
query.

> Another question: does PS imply LS?

Presence of a paragraph separator would imply a line break.
It does not imply a LS character.
 
> Or would I end a paragraph with LS PS?

No. You could, but it would imply presence of a blank line
before the end of the paragraph.

And keep in mind these are *separators". You don't end a
paragraph with anything. You separate two paragraphs by
use of a PS.

Pierre,

===========================================

All,

I've been trying to get a clear picture of what a "plain-text unicode
file" should look like (wrt control chars, bidi markup, &c.).

By "plain-text unicode file" I mean something that would be output by a
plain-text editor, eg. a Unicode-capable vi (Unix) or brief (DOS). No
HTML
or Web implications (altho such an editor could certainly be used to
prepare multi-lingual Web pages).

I have prepared a short text (not semantically very meaningful) with
mixed
directionalites so I can ask some concrete questions. I took the liberty
to attach the GIF to this message (about same size as the text).
Postscript and GIF versions of this text can also be seen at URL
   http://www.centrcn.umontreal.ca/~lewis/LJL/uniplain.html

Below, the text is shown in logical order (and all in English), with an
indication of the language in the postscript page (A=Arabic, E=English,
F=French, G=German, Y=Yiddish), and what I believe the levels should be.

  Some examples of dates. In Yiddish, "Monday, the 24th February 1997".
1 E................................E   Y............................Y

  In German, "Monday, the 24th Febrary 1997".
2 E.......E   G...........................G
  0000000000002222222222222222222222222222200

  In Arabic, "Saturday March 90\3\10" (March 10, 1990)

Notes:

o  Translations are fairly literal (and not always very accurate): just
   for general orientation. And there are surely imperfections in all
   but the French (with just my name, I'm pretty safe here).

o  line 3: I'm not too sure what the logical order of the date in Arabic
   is. Could be 10\3\90 (levels 2212122 -- three level-2 numbers
separated by
   level-1 backslashes) or 90\3\10 (all at level 2). Not too sure of the
   exact translation of words either.

** The logical order is, in general, the spoken order.  The fields of
the date
** would probably appear in the order the putative speaker would say
them,
** however this is one place where writing and speaking can diverge. 
Here
** it depends on the order in which the putative speaker would type
them.
** My description of what follows assumes the order you present is
correct,
** and the desired appearance is what you present on your web site.
**
** Now as to the levels: This is very long, bear with me.
**
** Solidus (Slash) U+002F is a European Number Separator (ES).
** Reverse Solidus (Backslash) U+005C is Other Neutral (ON).  You use
** reverse solidus but I'm not sure if this is to represent mirroring
(neither
** character is mirrored).  Either way, neither is a strong directional
** character.
**
** If the digits are Roman, by rule P0 all these numbers are treated as 
** Arabic Numerals because the preceeding strong directional character 
** is Arabic text (the 'h' in March).  You may have intended them to be 
** Arabic-Indic digits from the start.  Either way, the digits are AN.
**
** If you intended Solidus (ES) this is converted to ON by rule P3.  So
** either solidus or reverse solidus is ON.
**
** ON between AN is converted to R by rule N3(c).
**
** The quoted string on line 3 is thus "L R... AN AN R AN R AN AN L"
where 
** the L characters are the quote marks surrounding the text.  The
** base line direction is LTR because of the initial L (Roman 'I'), so
** the base level is 0.  In rule I1 the levels thus become
** "0 1... 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 0".  By application of rule L2 this first
becomes
** "Saturday March 09\3\01" as the level 2 runs are reversed, then
** "10\3\90 hcraM yadrutaS" as the levels 1&2 run is reversed.
**
** This is not consistent with the output on your web page.  To force
the
** date to be formatted left to right assuming this logical order, you'd
** need to force all date characters to L.  This can be done either
using an
LRM
** before the first Roman digit, if the digits are roman, or by
surrounding
** the date with LRO..PDF, if the digits are arabic-indic.  Note that
LRE
** won't work because the reverse solidus, being between two AN, would
** still convert to R, instead of L as desired.
**
** For example, using "Saturday March [LRE]90\3\10[PDF]", 
** assuming Arabic-indic digits, would resolve the levels to
** 01111111111111112443434420, progressively resulting in
** "Saturday March 09\3\01" -- level 4 reversed
** "Saturday March 10\3\90" -- levels 3 and above reversed
** "Saturday March 09\3\01" -- levels 2 and above reversed
** "10\3\90 hcraM yadrutaS" -- levels 1 and above reversed
** This is a direct result of the fact that the date is not a
** solid run of left-to-right text, because the solidus is still R.
**
** "Saturday March [LRO]90\3\10[PDF]" however would resolve to
** 01111111111111112222222220, progressively resulting in
** "Saturday March 01\3\09" -- level 2 reversed
** "90\3\10 hcraM yadretaS" -- level 1 reversed.

o  Quotes aren't the right ones (some should be low quotes, ...).

Questions

1) Do the levels in the above make sense (plus/minus some punctuation)?
   It may be that I've totally misunderstood levels.

** Generally, they make sense, see my discussion above.  Text does not
** necessarily change level simply because of a quotation, or because of
** a change in language.  So in line 2, the level wouldn't change simply
** because of a switch from English to German, since the German
** characters would be L.  Only LRE or LRO would do that.  Since you
** don't indicate strong formatting characters, I'd have to assume they
** were present to force the levels you indicate.

2) When embedding L2R in L2R (eg German in English, line 2) or R2L in
R2L
   (eg. Arabic in Yiddish, line 9, or Hebrew in Yiddish, line 5), should
   I use LRE/PDF and RLE/PDF (even though the direction doesn't change)?

** Generally, you wouldn't need to.

3) The second and third paragraphs are right-aligned (R2L main
direction).
   How do I indicate this? I thought of making each paragraph a block
   (separating them with PS, paragraph separator), and starting each
block
   with a strong char of the appropriate directionality. In the second
   paragraph, this would mean starting the block with RLM (since the
first
   letters are English). Ie. if base level is odd, main directionality
is R2L
   and the text is right aligned.

   Or, other possibility, starting a right-adjusted paragraph with RLE?
   But then what about a left-adjusted paragraph that starts with R2L
text.

** Either way would work.  Alignment depends on the base line direction,
** which is determined by the first strong character in the block.  The
** explicit directional formatting codes LRE, RLE, LRO, RLO as well as
** RLM and LRM are all strong directional characters.  LTR text within
** a RLE embedding will still format LTR, but the overall run of text
** within the embedding will be RTL.

4) What should I use to separate lines? LS or CR or LF or CR/LF? If I
use
   LS, which is a block separator, doesn't that interact negatively with
bidi
   markup (control chars), in particular embedding markups? Ie. I have
to
   reestablish the proper level at each line. And what happens with
right
   alignment?

   Couldn't this cause confusion. If I have two lines (in logical order)
       000 0000 00 00000 RLE 11 1111 LS    |    English RLE Yiddish LS
       11 11111 1 11111 00 0000 ...        |    Yiddish English ...
   and reissue an RLE at start of second, I can no longer tell whether
   I have one embedded segment or two (with a 0-level space between,
where
   the LS is). Could be an issue if I later reformat (reflow) this text
(as
   I might want to do in an editor).

   As a matter of fact, if the second line (after LS) starts with a
strong
   R2L character and I don't reissue RLE, won't the base level be set to
1?
   This would put the following English at level 2 (not intended as the
   English isn't embedded in the Yiddish here, but the other way
around).

   (I haven't read the recent thread on LS very carefully yet, but it's
   not too reassuring: lots of opinions)

@@ The standard is pretty clear. Most of those opinions are from people
@@ who have not read it. Think of these characters in terms of what you

** This is a good observation!  We believe the current standard is in

5) Does PS imply LS? Or would I end a paragraph with LS PS?

7) Any specific bidi markup required around the numerals?

8) What is the intent (as opposed to the effect which the algo surely

1).

** Quoted text where the text itself contains mixed directions is a

There are basically two models of plain text. The first is line-oriented,
the second is paragraph-oriented. Email or programm code is the traditional
example of line-oriented plain text. Descriptive text as it appears in
word processors, minus formatting, is the typical example of paragraph-
oriented plain text.

In traditional encoding (using CR/LF/CRLF) and in "official" Unicode
encoding (using PS), the two models are made compatible by treating
each line in the line-oriented plain text as a paragraph. On the other
hand, the paragraph-oriented model can be reduced to the line-oriented
model by splitting lines in a particular layout of the paragraph.
This splitting is again done by paragraph separators (CR/LF/CRLF/PS),
and not by LS.

LS is only used for certain effects in the paragraph-oriented model
that occur inside a paragraph. For example, I use it in some wordprocessors
to start an new line without having the last line aligned left in a
justified paragraph and/or without having the new line alligning
indented like a first line of a paragraph. The use to avoid paragraph
interspacing has also been mentionned. In summary, LS is an advanced
device for paragraph-oriented plain text, and not to be used for
line-oriented plain text.

That said, let's now look at BIDI:

LS is defined as a block separator, so you are right. When you
insert an LS to split the lines, your application could insert
arbitrary additional codepoints such as RLE. What it does insert
(or not) is outside of the Unicode BIDI spec, which only describes
static behaviour (what has to happen when the insertions are done),
and not dynamic interactive behaviour (which can be a lot more
complex if you want it to follow user's expectations, and given
that static BIDI is already difficult, I hope you get the point :-).

But when you edit BIDI text, you really should work with
paragraph-oriented plain text, without additional LSs. Then
everything will run more or less smoothly. Reformatting (reflow)
is done automatically and correctly. In those cases where you
indeed insert LSs, they will in most cases not be in the middle
of text, but at some logical interruption point, without the
need for frequent reflow.

This might be a solution for some very special cases. But in general,
for BIDI you should use paragraph-oriented plain text, with CR/LF/
CRLF/PS as paragraph separators. I'm pretty sure that when Microsoft
implements BIDI (or the way they already do it), they will treat
CR (what they use internally) as a block separator in the BIDI
algorithm.

SMTP email requires that line breaks be encoded as CRLF for all
things that are text (i.e. Content-Type: text/*). The user
(or the user agent) is also asked to limit line length to
something like 80 characters (actually 80 bytes).

CR and LF are system dependent, but in mail, it's always CRLF, and
mail user agents do the conversion.

That's because text/plain (and all of text/*) is already defined
to have these as CRLF, at 'short' intervals.

Because that may (or actually will) break some mail software.
I know many people don't like that (I don't either), but some
things in Internet mail are braindead, and will stay braindead.
Too many influential people are too used to the way things are,
and too many people are affraid of some software failing to work.

Of course, what you can do is to have your local user agent
change from CRLF to whatever line breaking convention you
use locally, which might very well be the "true" Unicode codes.

The problem is not the clients. The problem is all the software
that the mail passes from one client to the other.

There are actually several other models for files of 7-bit or 8-bit
character codes, commonly, but misleadingly, known as ASCII text files.

The original model was control of a Teletype machine, where several control
characters called for physical movement of the mechanism. Many of the bad
habits used in text files are survivals of this model. Others, fortunately,
have died out. (I am thinking of some of the uses of control characters in
editors meant for hard copy terminals.)

CRLF was *required* to initiate a new line, but CR by itself was sometimes
used for overstriking (if BS was not available), including underlining and
composition of APL characters, and also for imitating typewriter
overstrikes such as c| for the cent sign and some accented letters such as
u" or e`. HT and FF were very commonly used, and some others, such as SI
and SO, less so, but each of these specified a mechanical action. SI and SO
allowed a fairly standard way to control some dual-script devices including
ASCII/Arabic, ASCII/Cyrillic, APL/ASCII, and other combinations.

Many devices used ASCII control characters for new purposes, so that an
ASCII character string could specify the hardware behavior needed for bold
facing and so on. The actual process of printing might call for translation
from a 'text file' to an ASCII command string file which would produce the
same printed image by other means. For example, a printer driver for a
bidirectional printer could save time by printing alternate lines in
reverse order, with LF and some spacing commands between lines.

We then had the glass Teletype, or dumb terminal, model, which might treat
CR and LF as on mechanical devices, or might treat them both as new line
characters, or might do something else. At the same time, 'text files'
could still be used to control electronic printers, with varying
interpretations of some of the control characters.

Now, on computers with GUIs, we have different systems that expect CR, or
LF, or CRLF, as the new line signal, and have other interpretations of
other control characters. System software vendors are going off in all
directions inventing new misinterpretations of Unicode characters and
constructing yet other file designs.

We want to have a uniform, portable definition of the meaning of a file of
16-bit character codes interpreted as Unicode, or "Unicode text file" for
short. At the same time, we have several uses for such files, where
different interpretations may be desired. If we want to do this right, I
think we have to find the appropriate organization for defining such file
formats and uses, and get down to some serious and at times difficult
standard making. The Unicode character code standard does not seem to be
the right place to do this.

I wouldn't call them bad habits necessarily.  The primary bone of contention
here is the distinction between LF and CR...

Right.  And LF was used by itself to go down one row.

Actually I think that practically all CRTs treat CR and LF just as the TTY
did.  CR positions the cursor to the left of the current row, LF moves it
down one row.

Really the problem started when the UNIX designers decided that it was good
idea to have a storage model that was different than the tranmsission model.
This allowed some space to be saved on disk, and it made text processing
software a bit easier to write.  However, it complicated the tty driver by
requiring it to substitute CRLF for LF when displaying text files, which in
turn has led to all sorts of confusion about "raw" vs "cooked" mode, etc,
and the related distinction between NVT vs binary mode in Telnet protocol.

(It is a simplification that UNIX was the first disk operating system to store
textual files differently than it transmitted them, but it may have been the
first *stream-oriented* one to do so -- or at least the one we remember.)

Thus CRLF has always been the line terminator in ASCII (in the broad sense of
"not EBCDIC") text transmission.  Systems that chose to use different internal
representations have had the obligation to convert back and forth during
transmission.

It's interesting to speculate how different the world (of computing) might be
today if only a few arbitrary and perhaps whimsical decisions had been made
differently decades ago: if UNIX and several other popular platforms had used
CRLF rather than LF (or CR) as the line terminator; if DOS had used "forward
slash" (/) rather than "backward slash" (\) as the directory separator...  How
many person-eons of effort have gone into addressing the consequences of these
decisions...

> HT and FF were very commonly used...
>
(And still are...)  Now there's an interesting point.  Unicode has addressed
the CR/LF/CRLF confusion with LS and PS, but what about formfeed?  Isn't it
sometimes just as necessary to specify a hard page break as it is to specify a
hard line or paragraph break?  I suppose there must be a boundary somewhere
between "Trust your rendering engine" and "Mother, Please! I'd rather do it
myself!"  I don't have a copy handy, and I might be entirely wrong about this,
but isn't the Holy Koran a document that must be paginated in a specific way?

In any case, the strong Use-A-GUI thrust of Unicode will make it increasingly
difficult for certain kinds of people to operate in the ways to which they
have become accustomed over the past decades in which plain text was "good
enough" save that one could not put lots of languages into it.  For example,
today I can write a letter that spills over to one or more "second sheets" in
plain text and print it on a plain-text printer without a second thought,
using any software at all on any platform, embedding hard line, paragraph, and
page breaks in it, just as most of us still do with email (except for the page
breaks).  No "templates", "wizards", "profiles", "preferences", or
"Buzzword-1.0 Compliance" involved.  I can move this letter to practically any
other platform and it will still be perfectly legible and printable -- no
export or import or conversion or version skew to worry about.  I think a lot
of people would be perfectly happy to do the same in a plain-text Unicode
world using plain-text Unicode terminals and printers, if there were such
things.  But there's a bigger issue...

The idea that one must embed Unicode in a higher level wrapper (e.g. a
Microsoft Word document, or even HTML) to make it useful has a certain
frightening consequence: the loss of any expectancy of longevity for our new
breed of documents.  These higher-level systems will be overwhelmingly
proprietary due to the vast amount of coding that must go into them, the
voracious nature of the marketplace, etc, and so formats will become obsolete
with ever-increasing frequency, and it will become ever harder to extract the
plain-text characters -- the substance -- from them.  That which is perceived
at a critical moment in time to be worthy of preservation will be converted to
the new format, the rest discarded or left for decipherment by future
generations of information archaeologists.  (If you don't believe this is a
problem, think about what is happening to our (physical) libraries all over
the world at this moment -- get ready to say goodbye forever to five millenia
of history that was not worth digitizing.)  (And then to do it all over again
when the digital formats and media need conversion in another ten years.)
(And then again five years after that, etc...)

So let's do our part and make some effort to accommodate traditional
plain-text applications in Unicode, rather than discourage them :-)

It isn't.  My Egyptian Qur'an is one continuous text flow; the heading

such documents; the example of legal documents was brought up recently
wrt SGML style sheets.

In SGML I can't see using LS or PS.

I'm not sure what you're after.  I'm mainly concerned about the continued
viability of files containing only graphic characters, spaces, line breaks,
paragraph breaks, and formfeeds.  Plain, literal text that can contain
poetry, tables, source code, you name it, and stays like it is.

Pretty much what we have today with 7- and 8-bit plain text, except without
the confusion over CRLF/CR/LF, etc.  I think that what's really valuable about
these files is their self-contained and independent expressiveness -- they
don't need a rendering engine, they don't need any special transport protocol
-- they contain the text and the minimal control information to be transported
and understood universally.

You can still use U+000C FORM FEED in Unicode plain text, and a renderer that
knows about page breaks can do the "right thing", namely whatever it did with
^L for an ASCII text. FORM FEED, like HORIZONTAL TAB, was not considered to
be ambiguous enough in usage (unlike CR/LF) to require any separate encoding
in Unicode.

The goal of Unicode plain text is to recapture that portability in the
encoding, but also allow you to put lots of languages into it. The "Use-A-GUI
thrust" of Unicode acknowledges the fact that rendering of complex scripts
(including the Latin script with generative use of combining marks) requires
logic that is much more amenable to implementation in a GUI framework than in
a terminal model. However, appropriate (and very large and useful) subsets of
Unicode *can* be implemented with simple rendering models. (Cf. Windows NT
until very recently. :-) )

That is exactly what Unicode plain text is all about. And, by the way,
Notepad on Windows NT was pretty close to being a "plain-text Unicode terminal".

There is absolutely nothing new about this. I was warning my linguistic
colleagues about the longevity of their documents when they started using
WordStar back around 82/83. 7-bit ASCII is the only encoding that stayed
stable enough and was widely enough implemented to retain easy transmissibility
across the computer generations without the intervention of information
archaeologists. Well, 16-bit Unicode plain text is aimed at no less a
goal than being the universal wide-ASCII plain text of the 21st century.

Grumpy aside: This goal is not helped by people who treat Unicode as
a standards dumping ground for assigning numbers to everybody's favorite
collection of junk vaguely related to text, or who try to infiltrate
mechanisms (such as language tags) that do not belong in plain text.

I agree completely. An excellent example of the appropriate place for
a Unicode plain-text editor would be a Java IDE. If someone writes
a good Unicode plain-text editor for such an application, it would
have wider applicability. (I know I often use the editors of C++
IDE's to create (ASCII) plain text when I don't want it all gummed up
as a Word or Frame document.)

I disagree about the last point. A Unicode plain text file consists of
a stream of Unicode characters (and nothing else), interpreted according
to the Unicode standard. It should be marked with an initial U+FEFF (though
technically that is optional). This much is already clear from the standard,
as is the usage of LINE SEPARATOR and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR for minimal,
unambiguous, plain text formatting consistent with the bidi algorithm.

The situation is complicated by the two possible byte orders (which is one
reason for the U+FEFF) and by the fact that the most widely implemented
variant, namely that in Windows NT, chose LSB order instead of MSB order.

But other than that, there is not much more to be said about a Unicode
plain text file. The usefulness of the concept lies in its simplicity.

I can tell you don't know what table building in Sanskrit is like, and you
don't understand BIDI direction marking.

and the utter incompatibility of the extra 128 characters in the 8-bit sets
between PC DOS, PC Windows, Mac, various Unix definitions, and all the
other extended ASCII code sets such as PC code pages and the ISO 8859
series. Files of 8-bit characters are extremely non-portable.

Having lived in Korea and Japan, and been a mathematician and APL
programmer, I lost all faith in ASCII long ago. It is horribly inadequate
for English, and more so for almost any other language, except for various
computer programming languages and constructed languages like Lojban, which
were deliberately built within the limits of ASCII, or in the old days
EBCDIC.

I agree on the transport protocol in principle, although today we need
UTF-7, UTF-8, and other encodings, but the idea of full Unicode text
without a rendering engine won't fly.

That's fine for simple alphabetic scripts, and even for Chinese and
Japanese. It doesn't work right for RTL scripts (Arabic and Hebrew),
especially for mixtures of RTL and LTR, and for scripts that combine
characters into larger groups, usually syllables. This includes Korean, all
of the Indic scripts, Tibetan, and Ethiopic. Arabic script has a very large
dependence on ligatures, some of them quite complex. There are also
problems for rendering math expressions in plain text. Then there are
various deprecated characters, the private use areas, and the surrogate
character mechanism.

Anyone who thought the CRLF business was bad should consider how many
incompatible choices can be made in Unicode. Yes, it is true that the Unix
file model of a sequence of uninterpreted bytes is very general, and so is
a file of uninterpreted 16-bit codes, but files have to be interpreted to
be useful. We gloss over the amount of interpretation we do on ASCII text
files, but we cannot do that with Unicode.

I disagree about the simplicity of the problem. Some of the leading issues are:

byte order in storage and transmission
line, paragraph, and page breaks
BIDI (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.)
non-linear scripts (Indic, Korean, Mongolian, Ethiopian, etc.)
multiply accented characters (IPA, math, several human languages)
math
compatibility characters
private use characters
control codes
other deprecated characters
surrogates, especially unpaired surrogate codes
non-character values
text processing algorithms (sorting, upper and lower case, pattern matching)

Full portability of data requires some rules. If there is no standard,
users of "Unicode text files" will make every possible choice about each of
these issues. CRLF will be nothing in comparison. We have begun to see
programs that can handle CRLF, CR alone, and LF alone, either line-by-line
or in paragraph format, reading and writing in any option. The range of
choices for Unicode is far greater, and I don't want to think about how
long it would take to achieve unity if we don't do it now.

The process for dealing with byte order is fairly simple in itself, and the
standard gives clear conformance requirements. Most of the other issues I
listed have thorns, few in some cases, and many in others.

When I was in Korea in the 1960s, telegrams were printed linearly, so
Koreans can read this form of their script if they have to. Indic scripts,
Ethiopic, and a few others, would require special training to read as
separate elements in a straight line. Do we wish to say that users of these
scripts can't have text files? Do we say we have to come up with a suitable
rendering method for Unicode text files including full BIDI and full
character-->glyph composition? Do we say that there should be
implementation levels? None of these alternatives is quite satisfactory at
present.

Not Sanskrit, certainly, but I know a little about Hebrew by virtue of having
devoted some time to issues of Hebrew terminal emulation in the plain-text
world, and our Kermit terminal emulators (the software we make here) are quite
popular in Israel.  But yes, one must go through more than a few contortions
on one end or the other (or both) to handle BIDI issues in the terminal/host
setting, to the extent that Hebrew is (according to my sources) hardly used at
all in email.  The contortions involve generation and interpretation of
terminal-specific escape sequences for cursor positioning, reversal of writing
direction, character insertion, etc, and of course character-set invocation
and designation, all of which obviously add up to something more than plain
text.

So sure, of course I agree that plain streams of text are not adequate for
writing systems that are intrinsically bidirectional (like Hebrew) or for
which correct rendering is variable and context-dependent (Indic scripts,
etc).

(So where, you might ask, is Hebrew terminal emulation used?  As far as I
know, the major application by far is in library information systems like
ALEPH; there are some others, like a Hebrew version of the "vi" editor and
more recently, Mule (Multilingual EMACS).  At one point some years ago I
thought (naively) that the very same mechanisms could be used for Arabic
(after all, PCs have an Arabic code page), but in practice, as far as I can
tell, no speaker of Arabic would be satisfied with a character-cell
representation of Arabic text, because of the way characters must change
shape depending on their context (as you point out), which is evidently not
an issue in Hebrew (although it might be in Yiddish).)

Right -- I wasn't suggesting we all revert to ASCII -- the ability to write
text in as many languages as possible is why we're here!  I am looking for the
option to extend the simplicity (and success) of ASCII to Unicode -- or at
least to the large subset of it (as Ken said) that can be used "like ASCII".
To me this means the ability to compose a plain-text message containing a
certain amount of formatting controls like line breaks, paragraph breaks, and
page breaks, that are part of the same code, and without application-specific
metacodes (SGML tags, Microsoft Word codes, etc).  Let Unicode be able to
stand on its own!  (Of course, also let it be used in other applications --
but that's not the issue.)

If additional considerations need to be applied to the world's more complex
scripts in order to have a standard universal representation for plain text,
to whatever extent the Unicode 2.0 standard does not already suffice, I'm all
for it.  Let's not repeat the confusing aspects of ASCII -- particularly
CRLF/CR/LF semantics, and, as Ed suggests, let's not leave room for this kind
of confusion in areas that are new to Unicode.

And Ed Cherlin responded:

And now I think I understand where we were miscommunicating. I was
speaking of a Unicode plain text *file*, which I thought was the
issue. And for that the issue is simple. A Unicode plain text *file*
is Unicode plain text in a file (preferably marked with U+FEFF
and in MSB byte order).

But what Ed is addressing here is the standardization of the meaning
of Unicode *plain text*--an issue which should be considered outside
instantiation of that plain text in transmissible computer files.
On that point I agree that there are a vast number of issues which
require specification and standardization. And I do believe that the
Unicode Standard is the correct place to address many of them. I've
made the point before that one of the big differences between ISO/IEC
10646 and the Unicode Standard is that 10646 standardizes the encodings
and names of the characters, but that the Unicode Standard goes way
beyond that and attempts to provide enough information (some
normative and some informative) to enable meaningful and transmissible
implementations of Unicode plain text.

Below is Ed's list of leading issues. I've interspersed my comments
indicating what I think the current Unicode Standard's take is on
many of them. (Others may disagree, or may feel that things which
are not covered should be.)

> Some of the leading issues are:
> 
> byte order in storage and transmission

Byte order is addressed by the Unicode Standard.

> line, paragraph, and page breaks

The Unicode Standard specifies LINE SEPARATOR and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR,
but considers page break to be out of scope.

> BIDI (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.)

The normative bidi algorithm is specified in great detail in
the Unicode Standard.

> non-linear scripts (Indic, Korean, Mongolian, Ethiopian, etc.)

The Unicode Standard considers specification of script behavior to
be part of the desired content of the standard. It doesn't do an
equally detailed accounting of all cases, mostly due to resource
and information constraints. But Devanagari and Tamil script
handling are provided in significant detail as a guide to Indian
script behavior, and there is an extensive discussion of Arabic
script shaping behavior. There is a specification
of normative behavior for Hangul combining jamo. If we could get
equally detailed expert contributions for each complex script,
I expect the inclination of the UTC and the editors would be to
include them in the standard, for everybody's benefit.

> multiply accented characters (IPA, math, several human languages)

This is considered an integral part of the Unicode Standard, and
is detailed with both normative and informative sections.

> math

There is a definite gap here, though the topic has been a continuing
one for the UTC. The consensus seems to be that we would like to
get a consistent model of plain text math formula construction
stated, to make such information exchangeable in Unicode plain text.

> compatibility characters

These are now completely specified in the Unicode Standard names list.

> private use characters

Also specified by the standard, although the interpretation of
particular usages of private use characters is, by definition, out
of scope for the standard. But there has been some effort by people
to make available specifications of their particular private or
corporate private usage repertoires of private use characters.

> control codes

If you mean by this, U+0000 .. U+001F, U+0080..U+009F and the
control chimera U+007F, then the Unicode Standard does provide
a answer. It doesn't try to reinvent control function standards,
but it says those characters should be interpreted as if they
were 16-bit analogues of the 8-bit encodings of the corresponding
control functions. Maybe unsatisfying, but probably the best we
can expect, given existing control code usage.

> other deprecated characters

There may be room for improvement here, but the Unicode Standard
has had to tread a little carefully here. There are political
consequences in crying out too loudly that xyz are *deprecated*
when xyz may be somebody else's favorite set they lobbied hard
to get in!

> surrogates, especially unpaired surrogate codes

Surrogate usage (in general, as opposed to particular encodings
for surrogate pairs, none of which exist yet) is fully specified
by the Unicode Standard.

> non-character values

As opposed to unassigned character values, there are only two
non-character values in Unicode: 0xFFFE and 0xFFFF. The standard
specifies that 0xFFFE is the illegal byte-swapped version of
U+FEFF. The use of 0xFFFF is deliberately unspecified and is
untransmissible by design.

> text processing algorithms (sorting, upper and lower case, pattern matching)

Default case mapping is provided as an informative part of the
Unicode Standard. Language-specific casing is effectively also
a part of the standard, since everybody knows the few instances
in question: Turkish i, the debatable French accents, German , etc.,
and they are discussed in the standard.

Beyond that, sorting, pattern matching, etc. are out of scope of
the Unicode Standard (though some implementation guidelines are
provided), and, in my opinion, appropriately belong to other standards
under development.

Yes, but... The goal is interchangeable plain text that is legible
when interpreted and rendered in accord with the standard. The goal
is not to force everyone to "spell" multilingual text exactly the
same way. The drafters of the Unicode Standard tried to place normative
requirements on plain text where failure to do so would lead to
complete chaos. Obvious examples are specification that combining
marks must follow (not precede) their base character, and specification
of the complete bidi algorithm. Failure to specify either of these
would clearly have led to uninterpretable gibberish if everyone
made up their own rules, and that was clearly understood by the
members of the Unicode Technical Committee.

But one draws the line somewhere. No one wants to legislate against
people, for example, making cross-linguistic puns in text by
spelling out Russian words with Latin letters, or any other
"inappropriate" or creative usage of the characters at
their disposal, once Unicode implementations become more widely
available. Half the joy of having universal multilingual text
implemented on computers will be seeing what creative and fantastic
new inventions millions of users put it to.

Subject: Unicode Plain Text
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by watsun.cc.columbia.edu id VAA24596

I'm a little confused by this recent thread.  I get the feeling that some 
people think Unicode needs additional features to be useable, whereas I 
think that the necessary features need to be present in Unicode-supporting 
applications and fonts.  Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but I'll continue 
anyway.

I think maybe the problem is that the definition of "plain text" needs some 
refining with respect to Unicode.  To me, a Unicode plain text file would 
contain ANY Unicode character.  It would be the writer's responsibility 
(together with an input editor, perhaps) to make sure the file contained the 
minimum necessary information to render correctly, eg. proper placement of 
directional indicators, etc., and it would in turn be the application's 
responsibility to render the file in a readable fashion, given the 
information contained in the file.  Keep in mind that even 7-bit ASCII text 
still must be "rendered" by an editor on the screen.  Also, keep in mind 
that, according to the Unicode Standard, compliance does not necessarily 
mean full support.  An application might not have bidirectional rendering 
capabilities, but that does not mean that a Unicode file with a mixture or 
English and Hebrew/Arabic with directional indicators is not a plain text 
file.

What makes a plain text file different from any other electronic document, 
in my opinion, is the lack vs. the presence of "style" information, such as 
font, font size, margins, etc., and additionally, in the case of SGML 
instances, procedural markup.

As for usage standards, such as CRLF vs. CR vs. LF vs. LS vs. PS, etc., we 
have two options:
1.  agree on definitive standards now, and support nothing but, or
2.  support everything
Now, I have done enough programming to know that supporting more means more 
headaches, but I still feel that the second option is the better one at this 
time.  Feedback?

I finally had a chance to chat with my Arab friend to whom I owe this
short fragment. It is visually correct (on GIF/PS), but my logical
ordering was worng. The logical order is 10\3\90. So it seems that
things should automatically fall into place with no extra markup.

It is a reverse solidus. The digits are arabic-indic (U+066x).
So the reverse solidus, an ON, stays R as needed by virtue of the ANs
being treated as Rs for the purpose of resolving neutrals. Not simple,
but effective. That section of the standard really requires careful
reading and exploring :-).

The levels as shown are what I believe(d) they should be. I didn't
include the required BIDI markup, but would assume that the application
that outputs the file for this text would include whatever is necessary
to achieve this result. So you assumed correctly.

Thinking in terms of a word processor is what I'm trying to get away
from, because it's not really open. (And I live on Unix :-))

When I open up a file using vi on Unix, I can't tell if this file was
created with vi, emacs, pine, ed, sed, awk or whatever. There are still
issues (CR/LF/CRLF, TAB, FF placement, top 128 codes) with plain-text
ASCII files, but still, it is a very useful concept. Imagine if I had
to open mail from user A with vi, from user B with emacs, from user C
with pine because that's what each used to write to me. It would be
chaos.

Unfortunately, if we can't agree on some conventions for plain-text
Unicode files, we're going to get into this situation to some extent.
Right now, if I want to be as flexible as possible (in an editor, say),
I have to deal with 4 new-line conventions (maybe 5): CR, LF, CRLF, LS,
maybe NL. I have to deal with various placements of FFs. And I may have
to deal with various uses and misuses of some of the new codes.

I'll consider it changed.

I wouldn't let a user directly input/modify BIDI markup! Rather I'd have
him/her tell the editor what a piece of text should look like, then let
the editor issue whatever markup is required to achieve this at the time
the file is written out.

That's one area where I'd love more guidance from Unicode. FF is, I think,
a reasonable requirement for plain-text files, so I would have liked
Unicode to tell me more about it, or provide a PAS -- page separator.

P.S.1. I was shocked, when I visited the IUC10 Web site, to find HTML
pages in Unicode, but no plain-text files. Yes, let Unicode be able to
stand on its own (as fdc@watsun.cc.columbia.edu writes)!

P.S.2. Btw, one thing I love about "plain-text" files is that they have
the best chances of surviving. If I write stuff today that my 3-year
old will want to read when he turns 33, my only choice is plain text.
To write for him in French, plain-text ASCII (with the Latin1
assumption) is just fine. But if I wanted to add some notes in Greek,
Russian or Yiddish, I need more than just the ASCII conventions and
Latin1 codepage.

P.S.3. Someone in this thread stated that LF was a paragraph separator
in Unix. I see it as a line separator.

No, no, please, no! Whitespace, please, or some new category. FF can come
in the middle of a paragraph, or a sentence, or even a word.

Another good example of the confusion we need to prevent.

I can tell you don't know what table building in Sanskrit is like, and you
don't understand BIDI direction marking.

and the utter incompatibility of the extra 128 characters in the 8-bit sets
between PC DOS, PC Windows, Mac, various Unix definitions, and all the
other extended ASCII code sets such as PC code pages and the ISO 8859
series. Files of 8-bit characters are extremely non-portable.

Having lived in Korea and Japan, and been a mathematician and APL
programmer, I lost all faith in ASCII long ago. It is horribly inadequate
for English, and more so for almost any other language, except for various
computer programming languages and constructed languages like Lojban, which
were deliberately built within the limits of ASCII, or in the old days
EBCDIC.

I agree on the transport protocol in principle, although today we need
UTF-7, UTF-8, and other encodings, but the idea of full Unicode text
without a rendering engine won't fly.

That's fine for simple alphabetic scripts, and even for Chinese and
Japanese. It doesn't work right for RTL scripts (Arabic and Hebrew),
especially for mixtures of RTL and LTR, and for scripts that combine
characters into larger groups, usually syllables. This includes Korean, all
of the Indic scripts, Tibetan, and Ethiopic. Arabic script has a very large
dependence on ligatures, some of them quite complex. There are also
problems for rendering math expressions in plain text. Then there are
various deprecated characters, the private use areas, and the surrogate
character mechanism.

Anyone who thought the CRLF business was bad should consider how many
incompatible choices can be made in Unicode. Yes, it is true that the Unix
file model of a sequence of uninterpreted bytes is very general, and so is
a file of uninterpreted 16-bit codes, but files have to be interpreted to
be useful. We gloss over the amount of interpretation we do on ASCII text
files, but we cannot do that with Unicode.

I disagree about the simplicity of the problem. Some of the leading issues are:

byte order in storage and transmission
line, paragraph, and page breaks
BIDI (Hebrew, Arabic, etc.)
non-linear scripts (Indic, Korean, Mongolian, Ethiopian, etc.)
multiply accented characters (IPA, math, several human languages)
math
compatibility characters
private use characters
control codes
other deprecated characters
surrogates, especially unpaired surrogate codes
non-character values
text processing algorithms (sorting, upper and lower case, pattern matching)

Full portability of data requires some rules. If there is no standard,
users of "Unicode text files" will make every possible choice about each of
these issues. CRLF will be nothing in comparison. We have begun to see
programs that can handle CRLF, CR alone, and LF alone, either line-by-line
or in paragraph format, reading and writing in any option. The range of
choices for Unicode is far greater, and I don't want to think about how
long it would take to achieve unity if we don't do it now.

The process for dealing with byte order is fairly simple in itself, and the
standard gives clear conformance requirements. Most of the other issues I
listed have thorns, few in some cases, and many in others.

When I was in Korea in the 1960s, telegrams were printed linearly, so
Koreans can read this form of their script if they have to. Indic scripts,
Ethiopic, and a few others, would require special training to read as
separate elements in a straight line. Do we wish to say that users of these
scripts can't have text files? Do we say we have to come up with a suitable
rendering method for Unicode text files including full BIDI and full
character-->glyph composition? Do we say that there should be
implementation levels? None of these alternatives is quite satisfactory at
present.

fact that a standard for use of such files must address many more issues. I

No problem there. We might want to go further and *require* a byte order mark.

I don't know of any particular behavior that could be required of software,

More precision is required, I think, at least for CR, LF, HT, and FF.

OK. Unpaired surrogate codes should be marked in some way in rendering

The question is to some degree whether there is or will be a standard
library of string functions, as there has been in C and C++. Of course I
recognize that there were many such libraries, and perhaps that is
unavoidable.

I think the best way to discuss this is over some sample texts.

I don't know how much time I can put into this, but if I can I will go

a problem.

How do record oriented file systems fit into this discussion ?  

(Remember those file systems that ruled the world before the UNIX 
idea of the byte stream came along...)

I imagine the short answer is "they don't", and the longer one is 
something about record oriented files being fine, as long as the 
semantics of the defined control characters are honoured.

What I'm getting at, though, is whether there is anything in the 
definition of Unicode plain text that disallows such files.  Is there 
a mapping between the out-of-band record markers and Unicode 
separators ?  It seems trivially obvious to map to/from <NL>.  Or is 
this something that no one thinks should even be addressed ?

I'm not sure I understand your reasoning. During rendering a page break can occur
anywhere in the same way that a new line may be started anywhere as a line becomes
too full. (I'm using anywhere rather loosely.) Wasn't the question about *forcing*
a page break - surely this wouldn't normally be done within a paragraph or smaller
part. (Or were you thinking of text streams that have already been formatted by
some other process but are now plain text with line breaks etc. added by where
the formatting process felt they ought to be.)

I feel that adding FF may be part of a slippery slope to pretty text. What about
starting a new column or keeping text together?

Someone else suggested that New Line should just be white space not a block
separator. I don't agree - surely a paragraph is (usully) a new line with
some extra white space added - this implies the semantics should be similar.

They are far from dead; IBM VM/CMS and Digital (Open)VMS, to name
two, are still widespread.  But VM/CMS and other IBM mainframe
and midrange operating systems use EBCDIC text encoding and I am
not aware of any movement to support Unicode in this setting,
at least not internally.

In VMS, most text files are record oriented -- usually variable
length records, with end of line *implied* for each record, but
not recorded in any particular format.  This is actually quite a
sensible approach, given the wide variety of text-stream formats
that abound for no good reason.

In principle, it should be just as possible to fill records with 
Unicode as it is to fill them with ASCII, Latin-1, or JIS X 0208.

The VMS file system also supports the notion of "carriage control",
of which there are many types (like the once-familiar Fortran
Hollerith style, in which the first character specified whether the
line was to overprint the previous line, appear on the next line,
appear 2 lines down, etc, or start on a new page).  The carriage
control information, again, is separate from the file's data.  So
again, in principle, there should be no clash with Unicode.

In fact, I think a VMS implementation of Unicode text might be an
interesting exercise.  But this too begs the question of how to
map Unicode plain text into this environment, which in turn calls
for a Unicode plain-text standard for such things as page breaks.

And no, I don't think this brings us anywhere near any slippery slopes.
Page breaks have been an integral part of plain text since the 1950s
when we were programming IBM 409 Electric Accounting Machines by
sticking little wires into plugboards.

Please be extra careful here. The suggestion specifically was that
U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR (not NL nor LF functioning as newline) should be
considered WS (a technical category of the bidi algorithm, not white space
as processed, for example in a C preprocessor, or white space meaning
unprinted area on a text page) rather than BS (another technical category
of the bidi algorithm which is used to determine the boundaries of directional
blocks).

Cf. pages 3-15 and 3-17 of the Unicode Standard.

I think page breaks given by <FF> (0xC) belong in the block separator
category and imply an end of paragraph.  Page breaks that come in the
middle of a paragraph or word should be called _soft_ page breaks much
as we have soft line breaks.  We could talk about adding an optional
page-break analogous to the optional hyphen (0xAD), but computer
folklore of the years clearly indicates that <FF> shouldn't be
overloaded for this purpose.  (Off hand, I don't think an optional
pagebreak would be a useful code to have, since you'd really like to
have the semantic "eject if within n lines of the page bottom."  Such a
semantic requires the number n, which doesn't fit into a single code
position.)

And in practice. The portable Unicode backend library I have
written merrily reads and writes Unicode plain text into MVS and
VMS filing systems through standard C file interfaces. No problem.
I just don't depend on MVS or VMS to provide any specific interpretations
of *anything* in those files, nor would I want to, to stay portable.

Only *interesting* in the sense you mean if you depended on VMS
for anything other than basic system services underneath a C
library. To be portable, everything else would be built on layers
of support libraries independent of VMS.

I agree with Tim that page breaks are on the slippery slope to pretty
text. Pagination is not necessary for legibility of plain text in
the same sense that line breaking (forced in some instances) or
paragraph breaking (required among other things for bidi directional
control) are. Furthermore, since pagination assumes much more
about actual rendering devices, forced pagination is as often a
source of illegibility. (Think of all those preformatted documents
you've seen at one time or another that on your device display or print
with one or two lines spilled over to the next page for each forced
page.) I suspect that the device dependency of pagination is one
of the reasons why HTML doesn't use a built-in concept of page-break
on display or FF.

Again, think device dependency here. FF used to literally be the
electronic control for the "Form Feed" on a particular device. It
moved a mechanical device that shoved paper out and new paper in.

In modern Page Description Languages such as PostScript, an operator
such as showpage is a high-level operation that dumps a frame buffer
to a smart raster device. Trying to control such operations by
embedding an FF control character in plain text is pretty klutzy.

Subject: RE: Unicode plain text

But back in the '60s and early '70s we had line printers (with
fixed-width characters) and would ship "plain-text" documents to them
preformatted with the desired line and page breaks.  Such breaks
consisted of hard CRLFs and FFs to control the line printer, and they
could appear in the middle of a paragraph or word.  Similarly these
codes create such breaks on most modern printers.  So in this sense, an
FF can come in the middle of a paragraph or even a word.  But this
should be something down at the printer device-driver level.  It would
be a bad choice for file storage (unless it's a printer file).

To date, Unicode has avoided defining control characters except for the
TAB and NULL, precisely because there were multiple uses for these
characters.  The Unicode Standard states that "the others may be
interpreted according to ISO/IEC 6429".  Nevertheless, Frank's
recommendation that Unicode fill in some of the other control-character
semantics seems compelling, if only on a recommendation basis.  We
could, for example, enumerate the most common usages of the control
characters CR, LF, VT, and FF in contemporary software.

This is GUI thinking.  Think "plain text", no rendering engines.  <FF> is a
hard, unconditional page break.  Think of running off monthly paychecks on
your lineprinter, or addressing envelopes (and spelling peoples' names
correctly in hundreds of languages -- imagine that!).

It's funny how the pendulum swings.  Back in the old days we didn't even
have file systems, just boxes of cards.  Then we developed complex file
systems based on punched-card ideas (look at your old OS/360 JCL manual).  
Then we reacted against all of that complexity and said "a file is just a 
stream of bytes" with imbedded control information.  Now the simplicity of 
the stream approach is coming back to bite us because of all the differing
interpretations of the imbedded controls, since no standard was ever set for
their use in files.

Now we see that there is something to be said for keeping the control
information out of band -- it makes it really simple to change coding systems.
But anybody who has ever done VMS Record Management System programming knows
that the price is complexity and loss of portability.  You can't just "copy"
a VMS file to DOS or UNIX, you have to "export" it from the file system and
convert its record information to the appropriate stream format.  Nor can you
run an RMS program on a non-VMS system.

If we had it all to do over again -- and we do -- we could retain the
simplicity of the stream model without the confusion by precisely defining
a set of controls that may be imbedded, as we have done for LS and PS.
This will allow for both portable data AND portable software.

This is all true, but that does not mean there should be no such thing as
a forced page break.  Paychecks.  Envelopes.  Like any tool, a hard page
break can be used for good or evil.  It's not the tool's fault.

Again, printer files are common practice, and they are not sent only to
printers.  They are also viewed on terminals, "straight no chaser" or in
a text editor, and they are shipped around among diverse platforms.  There
is no reason to try to stamp out this practice.  It has its legitimate uses.

I agree that ASCII and ISO 6429 control characters are mess, and that is
why it is important to precisely define a minimal set for use in Unicode
plain text.  This might be done by defining semantics for the existing C0
and C1 control characters, or by adding new ones.

This will not only make Unicode able to stand on its own, but it will
allow export and import of fancy text between incompatible GUI
applications.  And it will provide a Common Intermediate Representation
for plain text that can last for decades, while the corporations slug it
out in the marketplace over their three-letter acronyms du jour.

I have to agree. Don't RFCs all come with FFs in them?

This is exactly what I was trying to get at in earlier messages. I would
say that there are other requirements in other cases, and it would be worth
our while to make a stab at enumerating them so we have some idea of what
we are talking about.

Here are some of the common uses of "plain text", each having a different
purpose and different constraints:

E-mail
Printer command files--ASCII, PostScript
Source code--programming, SGML, HTML, TeX
Encoded binaries--UUencode, UTF-7
Transfer formats--RTF, APL Workspace Interchange
Archiving
Portability
Database
Application file formats

Constraints on line length vary widely. I have seen database files with
lines of nearly 1000 characters, and of course there is the theorem that
any computable function can be expressed in one line of APL. :-)

Other constraints will also vary widely. We must allow for this variation,
and only specify what we have to.

[snip]

The snipped analysis was quite good, although a few points might be argued.

One of the best points is that we can require a certain competence from a
Unicode renderer. The implementor can decide which character ranges to
support, but having done that must support certain features in the way
specified in the standard. This mechanism can be extended to cover some of
the requirements of various text file usages.

This first type (usually the result of "save as text" from some WP)
always causes me trouble and I usually have to reformat it before I can
do anything with it (such as printing it).

I think the second type is by far the most common and is what I
consider to be plain text:

o  It's the format of all RFCs, perhaps the most widely-read plain-text
   files around,

o  It's the format of the vast majority of email and Usenet posts I read
   (but I do see some type 1 stuff),

o  It's the format of much e-documentation that comes with many S/W
   (eg. linux, TeX (at least installation), X.11, ...),

o  It's the natural format of all a2ps (ascii-to-postscript) converters
   I've come across, and (last but not least)

o  It's the format chosen by project Gutenberg, the wonderful collection
   of English texts. I have a dream here, of a multi-lingual project
   Gutenberg with classics in various languages, and, of course, in
   plain-text Unicode....

   (URL: ftp://uiarchive.cso.uiuc.edu/pub/etext/ )

I'd be really curious to see how one would express RFC2070, on
"Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup Language", as a type 1
plain-text file (for those looking for a challenge: type 2 plain-text
file of this RFC is at: http://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc2070.txt).

Of course, type 2 means some assumptions.

>    * The author knows exactly how many characters fit on a line. (Often

True enough, and that may break down somewhat with ideograms (surely
one can't fit 80 of those on a line). But, in general, staying under 80
chars will give a plain-text file that most can print. I rarely have
trouble printing a plain-text file of this second type. And I think this
will work with a lot of scripts, eg. Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic.

>    * The author knows exactly how many lines fit on a page.

Most plain-text files have no FFs, but when they do (as RFCs do), it's
not too difficult to be conservative so that again most folks can print
them with no problem. I don't see FFs as being on the slippery slope to
pretty text. Besides their use in RFCs (so the TOC can be paginated),
they're also often used to separate "chapters". For example, I'll save
all the posts on the current threads, and I'll probably put an FF
between each one so that, if/when I print the whole thing, I'll get
each post to start on a new page.

>    * The author knows in which sequence the characters in a line will
>      be printed. (Usually assumes left to right without any reordering.)

That's where it gets interesting (and why I had a few questions a few
days ago). The only ordering possible within the plain-text Unicode
file is of course logical. So that means a bit more intelligence in the
a2ps conversion or in the display engines. Or, in despair, such a file
could be put thru a filter that would reorder it into visual ordering
for local consumption.

In summary, notwithstanding some difficulties, I still think a
plain-text Unicode file of the second type above makes perfect sense
and would be very useful. I'm still not too sure how exactly I would
encode it (wrt controls), but this thread has been quite helpful.

Btw, this type 1 vs type 2 is a very useful distinction, and I think
therein lies the source of much confusion in the current threads.

Most decent plain-text editors have facilities for that.

Of course, so does HTML today. But none of that is plain text, troff,
TeX and HTML require some processing intelligence that may no longer be
around in 30 years. That may not be available everywhere.

Is there a specification somewhere that tells me how type 1 plain text
(using Tim's terminology again for a moment) will be formatted for
display and printing? Will things such as the following be dealt with
properly?

   This is a recursive bulleted list.

   o  Bullet one, a very long line.....
      that folds:
      - subbullet one a, another long line....
        that folds;
      - a second subbullet

   o  Bullet two.

Can I rely on this intelligence to always yield something that reflects
my intentions? With recursive bullet lists? With tables. Etc.

Ah, maybe that's what some folks mean when they ask for a standard for
plain text in Unicode?!

Or am I not more likely to see things such as what your email software
did to my original post:

> > o  It's the format of all RFCs, perhaps the most widely-read

> >    files around,

The middle line got folded, but the software didn't realize it was a
bulleted list :-)

> Within the Microsoft email system, we use rich text ...

Well I hope you won't send me such, as I won't know what to do with it.
Is it HTML-like markup? Of course rich text can be nice, but only if
everyone has it. The nice thing about plain text *is* that everyone has
it by default. But I think that applies only to type 2, ie. plain text
with hard line breaks, ie. preformatted.

The big advantage I see of the type 2 plain text (with hard line
breaks) is that it requires *no* intelligence to render correctly. Well
Unicode requires BIDI I guess (and let's hope that won't change in the
next 30 years). But otherwise, just adjust to line length convention
(by chosing a decent point size) and you're in business. No reliance on
some S/W to do some undefined reformatting and hope it won't
misrepresent your intentions.

The example you give doesn't apply. Independently of whether
LS is a block separator or treated as whitespace, there will
never be any text part B a line higher than a text part A
when logically, text part A is before text part B. This is
the very basic principle of the BIDI algorithm.

What is affected by the decision whether LS is a block separator
or treated as whitespace is whether bidirectional embeding and
overwrite codes are terminated (at the block boundary) or not.
As long as you don't have any of these, the only effect may be
that in the absence of any other convention, the first character
of a block defines the block's base directionality. Thus if LS
is a block separator, you risk that the second part of the
paragraph has a different base directionality than the first.

I suppose this is, indeed, a form of plain text, but I would call it "input
for a text formatter", not text to be used and viewed on its own as it stands.
It is a degenerate case of a larger class, e.g. input for TeX, Scribe, Troff,
IPFC, SGML, or HTML (for text formatting).  It is only in the last few years
that I began to receive "long-line" text in email, and I can only suppose that
it was generated by some sort of editor that does its own word wrapping during
input, but does not send the line breaks on the mistaken assumption that every
email client in the world is (or should be) also a text formatter.

Right -- this is the kind people have been using for more decades than many of
us have been alive.  It does not deserve the bad rap.  Of course we all find
it irritating when the composer of such text assumes wider or longer pages
than we have, but that is not a reason to abolish this, the most common form
of plain text -- in fact, it is all the more reason to set standards for its
use.  "Standard lines are so wide; standard pages are so long", etc.  Such
standards tend to be set of their own volution, e.g. among e-mail and netnews
users, where recipients of badly formatted messages tend to take it on
themselves to educate the senders as to common practice.

Ideally, preformatted plain text can also be fed into your favorite rendering
engine to produce the effect that most pleases your eye, and indeed we have
been doing this sort of thing for decades with many formatters.  I grant that
automatic recognition of nested bullet lists or meticulously formatted tables
might be a stretch, but it is certainly not difficult to treat blank lines as
paragraph separators, and otherwise to ignore line breaks when reformatting
prose such as this.  But once any kind of markup ("this is a table", "this is
a bullet list", "this is a section of preformatted text") is introduced, our
plain text becomes "input for a text formatter".

Incidentally, another form of plain text is "output from a text formatter",
which often has been hyphenated.  Such text is an end result, not intended for
further processing.

I think that living in a world of email has demonstrated the value of plain
text, at least to most people.  The lesson is that this is the only text form
that can be sent without prior prearrangement with any reasonable expectation
that it will be readable at its destination.

Some scripts are neither left-to-right, nor right-to-left.

1.

Mongolian is written top-to-bottom; Japanese and Chinese used
to be written this way, the lines were stacked right-to-left.

Recently, somebody (sorry, I haven't kept that note) has said that
mixing Latin with Japanese was impossible, hence modern Japanese is
written left-to-right. However, there is a way to mix top-to-bottom
with horizontally written scripts: about twenty years ago I have seen
a book in Japanese, written top-to-bottom, with German proper, and
place, names imbedded. These were also written top-to-bottom, with
the glyphs rotated by 90 degrees; so you could turn the book counter-
clockwise to read these names, in the usual way. This imebedding
method would also work with left-to-right phrases in Mongolian text.
For righ-to-left scripts, you would have to turn the glyphs the other
way.

I think, it would be useful to have this method described in a
forthcoming Unicode standard.

2.

Some old scripts (Greek, Latin, Hethitic, Runes) were used to write
boustropheda. A boustrophedon runs back and forth like a ploughing
ox (thence the name), i.e. the lines are written, alternatingly,
left-to-right and right-to-left.

As Unicode will adopt the Runes alphabet (or rather: fuark), it
would propbably be useful to have boustrophedon-markers akin to the
existing LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK and its siblings, U+200E .. U+200F and
U+202A .. U+202E. These markers could be used to mark plain, logically
formatted, Unicode text. (To mark physically formatted text, you could
probably use the OVERRIDE characters, U+202D and U+202E.)

Also a normative boustrophedon algorithm, akin to the existing bidi
algorithm would probably be nice to have. I guess, this algorithm
could be much simpler than the bidi algorithm, as the boustrophedon
feature will apply only to whole paragraphs (it is more like a layout
style, which does not have to allow for intrinsic character features).


Opinions? Am I wrong, again?

Thanks for the pointer, I don't think I had it. Well done (just had a

HTML certainly is an interesting alternative to plain text because it
is so universal (and, hopefully, with a stable foundation). And it
allows to include illustrations, annotations, &c.

There is an infinite number of alternatives to plain text.  Anybody, anywhere
can make up whatever such alternatives they like -- and they do.  HTML is
controlled by Netscape and Microsoft, and changes every five minutes as each
attempts to outdo and undercut the other.

Plain text is an interesting alternative to HTML because nobody controls it
but "just us chickens", and it alone stands a chance of surviving year after
year, decade after decade, as the corporate giants pull the rug out from each
other (and us) on a weekly basis, with their proclamations of ever more
complex proprietary "standards" with which we all must "comply".

This is not to say that a simple and stable form of HTML -- say 1.0, but
augmented by some minimally adequate method of coping with character sets --
is not a suitable method for publishing literary classics on the Web -- after
all, this is the sort of thing the Web was originally designed for, lest we
forget...

But this is not to say that even a stable form of HTML could be thought of as
a replacement for plain text.  My printer does not render HTML; my email
client is not a Web browser.  My text editor is not an HTML authoring system.
My C compiler does not compile HTML.  My Telnet client does not interpret
HTML.  And perhaps most important, the incomprehensibly enormous corpus of
existing plain-text information does not need to be converted to HTML or
anything else (except perhaps Unicode plain text), especially since any such
requirement would leave most of it behind, and even that which was deemed
worthy of conversion would become obsolete as soon as HTML is replaced by the
next thing.

I thought at least some baseline HTML came from more neutral bodies
than these two corporations?! Of course, HTML is an acceptable
alternative to plain text *only* if it is corporation-neutral,
widespread, and reasonably stable.

I certainly wouldn't agree to any MSIE-or NN-specific extensions being
used in the texts offered by these projects, but this specific site is
quite legible with lynx, so I assume it doesn't use too many fancy
features.

Well put.

Since the German Gutenberg project uses latin 1 (the HTML default),
they don't even need any extensions over HTML 1.0.

Same here. Still, browsers are getting pretty common, so for a project
Gutenberg, it's probably a reasonable choice.

In my opinion a Unicode renderer should cope with this automatically
and divide paragraphs up into lines for you. This is mostly because
of the intelligence of the BiDi algorithm. What you won't get is
page headers and footers and page numbers since there is no way to
specify them in Unicode plain text. Is there general agreement that
text that is only split into paragraphs should be rendered properly
by a Unicode engine? I.e. it is acceptable as plain text.

Can I have the original source please! I suspect that documents like this

I'm not so sure that fixed width Arabic will look good but the general point
holds. But should I need to fiddle with point sizes if Unicode renderers will
accept type 1 text.

Type 2 text is very common. And it is the published form. In some cases the
original marked up text will have been lost. Where it hasn't a Unicode type 1
style plain text file could be produced from the original.

I dug out some troff documentation and it says that the plain text output is
a representation that is an approximation to the printed page. I suggest
that much of the type 2 text is in this form, i.e. Formatting *including* BiDi
has already been carried out. Does anyone have examples of mixed direction
text in RFC style format that could confirm this?

I think that for type 2 physical format files Unicode rendering is *too*
intelligent and would scramble the preformatted lines if they contained BiDi
text. (As well as getting horribly confused by the NLs which presumably have
been converted to Line Separator.)

I would propose a new control code - Disable BiDirectional Processing which
would switch off BiDi altogether. It could be used with physical format files
so that they come out as intended. (There needs to be an Enable code as well.)

I'll also allow you a Page Separator. This would be treated as a block
separator by BiDi and would cause a new page to be started.

The introduction of a new control code would mean that existing text that uses
the current standard would work in the same way, but additional control could
be given to text that needs it.

Both HTML and XML rest on a very stable foundation: SGML.  The
unicode standard defers quite a number of things to "higher level
protocols".  SGML just such a protocol, XML represents a profile
of the SGML standard that makes writing processing applications a
lot easier.

If you invest a lot of energy building a document system around
HTML, you will be SOL when HTML falls out of fashion.  If you
spend the same energy building a document system on the SGML
foundation, you can automatically deal with HTML and all its
variants, XML, or whatever the next fad is.  Real SGML tools are
polymorphic.

> Es lebe plain text!  (long live ~)

I find this a tragic position.  Before unicode, the common
denominator for cross-platform data transfer was 7 bit ASCII. 
Unicode charged ahead to raise the common denominator but
statements like this essentially say that the common denominator
should go no further.  This is counter to the spirit that
inspired Unicode and counter to the standard itself which
explicitly defers a number of important dimensions of text
processing to higher level protocols.

Plain text is simply not an option for most anyone serious about
their documents.

But that is to say that Unicode is useless except in combination
with a higher level protocol over which it has no control.  I
have absolutely no faith in any higher level protocol.  They come
into fashion and then exit ignominiously with astounding speed.

So perhaps the need for plain text is "tragic" (so too would be the
fact that many citizens of earth do not possess high-end bit-mapped
rendering engines, let alone sufficient food to eat), but it is
nonetheless real.

I think a lot of Unicoders have little idea what the real world is
like.  They know it is populated by people who speak many languages
written in diverse writing systems, which is a step forward.  But
they don't pay much attention to the "low tech" computer-related
components of everyday life -- not only in the less "developed"
countries, but even in the rich ones.  They seem to believe that the
only use for computers any more is Web browsing and composition of
glossy (multilingual) sales brochures.

Try to remember all the real work that computers are doing every
day in hidden places: medical and laboratory equipment, manufacturing
equipment, telecommunications equipment, traffic control, POS, EDI, etc.

Case in point: the imbedded microprocessors and microcontrollers
whose interface to the outside world is a lowly serial port, and
which have only a few K available for their control program.
Countless millions of them, chosen precisely for their low cost.

Now, isn't it our goal for Unicode to become, eventually, the world's
one-and-only character set?  Good!  Then let's not lock out the low
end.  Let's see if we can't separate the concept of character set
from the *necessity* for higher (and lower) level protocols and the
need for a high-end rendering engine.  (Sure, use them if you want,
but that's a totally separate issue.)

I never said and most certainly did not mean to imply that
Unicode is "useless" without higher level protocols.  That
proposition is absurd.

Your opinion does not change the fact that a great many
applications would be impossible without higher level protocols,
transient or otherwise.  (I'd hardly describe SGML as transient
though--it dates back into the 1960s and has continuously gained
in pouplarity ever since with no sign of fading in the future.)

...but I never said anything about a monolithic standard
including low and high level protocols!  I'd be the first to say
it would be a Bad Idea for exactly the reasons you cite.  I would
also add that separation is critical because different
applications may need different high level protocols.  SGML works
great for publishing type applications, but it certainly is not
an answer to every text processing applications.

Sun has been actively involved in the development of XML, so
their position is no surprise.  Lately Microsoft has been jumping
on the "standards" bandwagon (witness the ditching of WINS for
DNS, adoption of Kerberos, etc.) and a move to XML in particular
represents taking a distinctly different direction than Netscape,
whose founder has publicly stated that SGML is stupid--a position
I firmly believe will only hasten Netscape's death if it
persists.

This is nonsensical.

In the world of HTML, you have a fixed set of tags you can use in
your documents, and you must assume that the browser knows how to
do something sensible with them (not always safe).  With XML, or
SGML for that matter, your document gets marked up using tags
appropriate for the data being marked up.  The document gets sent
to the browser along with a style sheet so that the browser can
do something sensible when it encounters the markup.  This allows
for (a) more concise and precise markup of the document and (b) 
more precise control over the ultimate rendering by the browser. 

The push for XML represents a "back to the roots" movement.  The
basic premise of SGML is that it is impossible to define a markup
language that is both general and precise.  Thus, SGML is a
meta-language; a language for defining markup languages.  At a
technical level, SGML standardizes parsing--how to distinguish
markup from data.  HTML is just a single markup language defined
in terms of SGML.  However, the promotion of HTML as a universal
exchange format is fundamentally at odds with the spirit of SGML.

A problem with using SGML in a web environment is the complexity
of the software required to implement the parsing rules.  Enter
XML.  XML basically does away with numerous non-essential
features of SGML that complicate parsing, things like tag
omission and minimization, shortrefs and the like.  XML also
raises the compliance bar on character encoding from 7 bit ASCII
to Unicode.

First, don't take anything I write too literally. I make available most
of my project documentation in HTML. So I'm not religious about these
things. The above is not an exclusive statement. HTML serves a most
useful purpose and I'm not saying to ban it!

Second, Unicode is something more or less orthogonal to the notion of
plain text. So I don't really understand your comment above. Plain text
does not mean 7-bit ASCII. It could just as well mean UTF-8 Unicode.

Third, for all the great things that can be said for SGML, HTML, XML,
and <whatever>ML, it still remains that plain text is the most portable
format, the simplest to deal with (on all platforms), and the only one
that is likely to be legible in 30 years. For some things, it's still
the best solution.

That depends on the purpose. For example, I'm writing some biographical
notes on myself (how pretentious can one get :-)?) so my son will know
a bit about me should I leave early. I can't think of a better medium
for that than plain text (Latin 1 here). Surely not some WP that will
be so badly out of style by the time he gets to read the stuff (he
doesn't talk yet)...

And look at a typical novel. Plain text is all that's required to
capture it. Marketing glossies are another matter of course. And so is
most technical documentation.

Anyway, getting off topic again!

And what about the Standard Generalised Markup Language (SGML)? This has been
around for ages. It lets you define a set of markup tags and then use them.
HTML is a particular set of SGML tags and the SGML definition of HTML (the DTD)
is available from W3. If you are writing text in HTML I would strongly recommend
that you put a DTD version declaration at the top. e.g. 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"> which is English with HTML 3.2
markup. Then syntax check the HTML with a SGML parser to make sure it conforms.
Finally keep a copy of the DTD somewhere safe along with a copy of the matching
HTML standard so that future generations can always understand your text. (The
copy of 3.2 that I have is about 12K in size.)
You might want a copy of the SGML standard too - I don't know where to get a
machine readable copy from.

It is no accident that Silicon Valley thrives in Earthquake country.

But while everything seems to be in constant turmoil, and yesterday's
hot new item is today's trash -- try to take the long view.

1. The Information Technology industry is still in its adolescent
phase (no longer its infancy, certainly), but maturing rapidly. As
industrial technology matures, it tends to stabilize into well-
understood, efficient patterns, with competition for innovations just
fizzing around the edges. Handling of multilingual text as part of
the general problem of automated information technology is still
in ferment, but we can see the beginnings of the crystallizations
of well-understood, accepted ways of dealing with the issues on
computers.

2. Unicode is laying the (firm, we hope) foundation for plain text
representation through the next century--perhaps longer. In any
case, like ASCII, it should last long enough to gain the lustrous,
comfortable patina of trusted age. Just as my nieces now find it hard
to conceive of a political age before Ronald Reagan, people just
being introduced to computer science and programming in Java will
find it hard to conceive of character sets before Unicode.

--Ken (Color me rosy) Whistler

P.S. For those who, like me, worry that all electronic data
not in plain text (and ASCII plain text at that) is in constant
danger of disappearing into the enormous historical bit bucket
of undecipherable formats using undecipherable encodings on
obsolete media, consider the following: Perhaps the greatest source
of information loss in the longrun was the shift by the publishing
industry to use of cheap high-acid papers early in this century.
Ask librarians about the conditions of their pre-War collections
(my nieces just asked, "The Gulf war?") of books. Or how about
all the nitrate movie film stock collapsing into dust?

It's getting a little off-topic, but ... .  Arguably the single 
event causing the greatest information loss was the destruction of the 
library at Alexandria, which broke countless links in chains of 
transmission of unique manuscripts.  Acid paper and nitrate film have 
destroyed lots of copies, but most information of any signnificance 
produced in this era has been reproduced in lots of copies, and 
procographically recopied at a trivial cost compared to the cost of 
copying a manuscript by hand (which is why there were so many unique 
copies in Alexandria).

>From other replies I've received I guess I wasn't clear about my
point.  Within the domain of "plain text" Unicode is doing a lot
to raise the common denominator.  This is great, but a sentiment
has been expressed in this thread that higher level protocols are
a hopeless mess and if you want portability, stick with plain
text.  In the near term that may be a reality but Unicode was
born out of frustration with the existing mess of character
encoding standards and a determination to make things better.

I was simply making the observation that swearing off high level
protocols because they are messy now seems very out of character
with the spirit of Unicode.

To clarify another posting, I did not say or mean to imply that
higher level protocols should be addressed by the Unicode
standard.  That would be a Bad Thing for numerous reasons I'm
sure you can all figure out.

Explain to me how SGML is less portable than plain text?  If you
don't have something that understand the tags, any reasonable
text editor can strip them out leaving you with plain text.  You
don't need anything fancier than a text editor to create and view
SGML documents. You are no *worse* off using SGML than you would
be using plain text, but chances are good that you will be better
off.  In 30 years, SGML will still be legible because, unlike
other markup schemes, it is a public standard not bound to a
particular transient software product.  This is why you find SGML
in places like the aircraft industry where documents have active
lifespans longer than most software companies.

No need to worry about electronic data disappearing in the
future, it has been disappearing for quite some time now thanks
to being stored on flakey or obsolete media, or in undocumented
data formats of long extinct software.  In a former life as a
librarian, I spent quite a bit of time dealing with electronic
data sneaking into the library inside the back covers of books
and in other ways. 

Librarians have been fretting over digital data for some time
now.  Unlike computer scientists, we have been through the
preservation thing many times.  It is true, a book published in
the 1700 is as good as new (okay, I exagerate a bit...) while
relatively recent publications turn to dust thanks to cheap
paper.  Most of the computer science literature has been
published after the "acid incident" so as a discipline, they tend
to be are blissfully ignorant of the event. 

The problem is not really that data isn't in plain text format,
although that is sometimes helpful, but that the formats are (a) 
not documented and (b) there are way too many of them.  Even if
they were documented, condition (b) makes it too expensive to
deal with unless it is *really* important data.  SGML makes a
serious attack on both problems.  I just hope the marriage of
SGML and Unicode in the form of XML is successful in bringing
portable, durable documents to the masses.  Then continue ironing
out the storage media qirks and librarians will be happy.  :)

I don't see them as messy, just as short-lived. I don't perceive
HTML as messy, quite the opposite (notwithstanding frequent abuse by
authors such as using <Hn> tags to get bold/bigger), but I don't expect
to still use it in 30 years. For my part, I'm not swearing off high
level protocols, but I think a very good point can be made for plain
text, and I had a few questions I wished clarified wrt Unicode. That's
all.

Hi!

Sorry for asking a maybe trivial question (and for
getting a bit off-track):

>  <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN"> 
>  which is English with HTML 3.2 markup

What "in English"?  English markup or English
"proper text"?

I could imagine (though there is none now)
HTML 3.2 markup in, say, Swedish.

But are you saying that if the "proper text"
of the document is in, say, Swedish, I should write
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//SV">
at the top, even if the markup is "in English"?
(I thought that the "EN" meant that the
**markup** is based on English words.)

And language attributes are to become a part
of HTML, suitable also for multilingual
"proper texts"...

	(Sorry, I don't know SGML.)

Nobody advocates stamping out higher level protocols, even if that were
possible.  We all use them all the time.  I, for one, use them with my
eyes open -- i.e. with full knowledge that all the work I put into
creating a "rich" document will need to be done again at some point when
the current "standard" for richness has been replaced by a new one if I
want the document to survive.  And again.  And again.

I remember the excitement when it first became possible to produce
typeset-quality documents with Troff, R, DSR, Scribe, TeX, and their
relatives.  But I also continued to produce plain-text "documents" on a
daily basis: email; netnews; computer programs in assembly language,
Sail, Simula, C, Fortran, Pascal, PL/I, etc; online documentation that
had to be portable to hundreds of platforms; plain-text record-oriented
databases -- mailing lists for example.  There is no reason for most of
this sort of information to be "rich" and that this type of work should
not continue in Unicode.

What is needed is emphatic allowance and support for Unicode plain text
in the Unicode standard, i.e. a precise and thorough definition of what
constitutes a self-contained preformatted plain-text document.  This is
primarily a matter of adopting a small but complete set of control codes
needed for line breaks, paragraph breaks, page breaks, and direction
control (most of these are already there), and a clear statement of the
role of the "traditional" control characters at U+0000 - U+001F, U+007F,
and U+0100 - U+011F.

And outside the scope of the Unicode standard is the problem of properly
tagging files in the file system.  This has never been done right, on
any operating system.  The use of the "extension" (the part of the name
after the dot, e.g. "DOC") is just plain silly, especially now that
GUI-based operating systems are using this to associate applications
with files -- click on a data file, launch the associated application on
that file.  What's silly about it is that anybody can name a file any
way they please and there is no registration authority for extensions;
conflicts inevitably arise -- sometimes with disastrous consequences.
Even sillier is the idea the each file must belong to one and only one
application.

Plain text files can be used by many applications, but how do we mark
them as being written in Unicode?  Or Latin-1?  Or JIS X 0208, etc.
Ideally there should be information in the directory entry to specify
the file type and encoding.  That's an issue for each OS maker, but one
whose resolution is long overdue.

The transient nature of these markup languages is not a trait of
markup languages, but a product of having a one-to-one
relationship between the markup language and a specific piece of
application software.  TeX files go with TeX, troff files go with
troff, Scribe files go with Scribe, WordPerfect files go with
WordPerfect, MS-Word files go with MS-Word.  If the application
falls out of favor, it takes its markup language and data with
it. 

Exactly the same thing happens if you depend on software that
uses its own unique character encoding, or the glyph encoding of
some oddball font.

It is percicely this fatal one-to-one markup/application
relationship that SGML is targeted at.  SGML is very different
beast and it is a mistake to throw it in with the rest.  Claiming
that SGML is just another transient markup language that doesn't
address document portability is similar to saying that Unicode is
just another transient character encoding scheme that doesn't
address multilingual computing.   Absurd?  Of course.

I think we differ on the notion of "plain text" and "markup". 
Lets see. In email for example, what is the difference between
this markup: 

  From: jfieber@indiana.edu
  To: Whoever@somewhere
  Subject: la de da

  blah blah blah blah...

and this markup:

  <from>jfieber@indiana.edu</from>
  <to>Whoever@somewhere</to>
  <subject>la de da</subject>

  <body>blah blah blah blah...</body>

Semantically identical. Furthermore, the correct delivery of mail
and news depends critically on markup as does netnews.  However
you delimit it, it is still markup.  Same for the computer
languages. What are braces, semicolons, parentheses, and comment
delimiters in C if not markup to guide the compiler in parsing
the program?  Incidentally, most computer languages could be
expressed in SGML markup (although the utility would be dubious).

Unlike other markup languages, SGML makes no assumptions about
the processing application.  SGML merely provides a standard way
for an application to distinguish markup from data.  This allows
SGML to be used as a foundation for a much broader range of
applications and helps ensure a long life.  On the other hand, as
you may guess, SGML is not a complete solution--if typesetting is
your domain, for example, you will still need some software to do
the layout of your data (TeX works quite well)--but SGML serves
to protect your data from dependencies on specific applications.

That protection facilitates exchange between applications.  In
one case you feed your document to a typesetter, in another case
you feed it to a database, in a third case, an on-line document
viewer.  Portability between applications extrapolates to
portability across time.  HTML may be out of fashion in 20 years,
but any SGML compliant application can still process it even if
the degigners never heard of HTML.  (You might have to make up a
style sheet, but that is orders of magnitude easier than the
digital archaeology required to re-invent, say troff, from a
couple sample document.  SGML documents come with their own
rosetta stone--the DTD, or document type definition.)

In an SGML world, the data drives the application, not the other
way around as is the status quo currently.  That is the
fundamental shift that sets SGML apart from the other markup
languages cited here as examples of why markup languages are to
be avoided when document portability is a concern.

I think the notion of "plain text" is a little muddy as these
sorts of codes represent markup that is conceptually no different
than, say, SGML.  I fully agree, however, that there is room and
a historical precedent for a small set of control (markup) codes
in Unicode, but getting people to agree on what constitues
"complete" is another matter.  :) 

I would propose that "complete" be defined as a minimal set of
markup codes necessary to make a document understandable by a
human without resorting to anything outside the Unicode standard.
Machine processing, beyond doing the Right Thing with whitespace
should not be a criteria. Except for directional control, most of
the necessary markup should be covered by addressing
compatibility with ASCII, although clarification would be
helpful.

SGML offers some options here by hiding file system (or any
storage mechanism) behind an entity manager which provides for
such tagging.  The details are not currently covered by the
standard (which treats the entity manager pretty much as a black
box), but the entity manager in James Clark's SP system offers a
good example of how it might be done.

Except that it can parse SGML.  I'm not arguing against SGML --
quite the opposite: I'm heavily in favor of (almost) anything that
has survived the international standards process AND sees use in
the real world, as opposed to schemes that companies make up and
unilaterally proclaim to be standards.

But SGML is to mark up text for later formatting to fit the
requirements of some output device or application that understands
this kind of markup.  As distinguished from plain text as we have
known it since the 1960s, in which a repertoire of graphic
characters is mixed with a small number of control codes (call
them markup if you wish) for simple actions like line breaks and
so on, in order to achieve the *final* result, not (necessarily) to
be input for a higher-level reformatter.

Right.  Something like the following (ignoring BIDI for the moment):

 . LS is a hard line break.  The next graphic character appears
   at the left margin of the following line.  Equivalent to CR and
   LF on a Teletype.

 . Two LSs result in a blank line.

 . Three LSs result in two blank lines, and so on.

 . PS is a hard paragraph break (more about this below).

 . <FS> (form separator), whatever its instantiation (a new
   Unicode character, or ASCII Formfeed with a well-defined use in
   Unicode), starts a new page.  The next graphic character
   appears on the top line, leftmost position of the new page.

 . Two FSs result in a blank page, and so on.

Plus whatever is needed for specifying writing direction,
including expanding on what is meant by "left", "top", etc, in the
preceding items.

That should do it.  Personally, I find text to be most portable
when it is displayed in fixed-width font, and spaces are used to
line things up, rather than tabs (because tabs require external
agreement about the tab settings).  I don't think Vertical Tab or
other obscure formatting controls (such as Line Feed taken
literally) are of any use; in my experience they have always been
treated as "synonyms" for the controls listed above.

Then what to do about ASCII controls in Unicode text?  I'd say
that since ASCII (and Latin-x, etc) must be converted to Unicode,
then it is the responsibility of the conversion agent to
understand the local conventions for line breaks (etc) in the
source text, and to convert to the well-defined Unicode controls.

About Paragraph Separator...  It seems to me that this one was
designed with the "export from word processor" type of file in
mind (those files we were discussing earlier in which each
paragraph is a long line, terminated by a "paragraph separator"
such as CR).  I would not call this type of file plain text --
I would call it "input for a text formatter"; it needs further
processing to be readable.  (For example, if I print such a file
on the local Laserwriter, the long lines are truncated -- thus
I only see the first 80 characters of each paragraph.)

Clearly we can become increasingly epistemological about what
constitutes plain text (yes, C source code is input for a C
compiler, but it is also text to be read, understood, and edited
by people, sent by email without being reformatted, etc).

And obviously some details still need working out: treatment of
soft hyphens and such.  But I think we're on the right track.

No, but its useful range of applications is quite a bit wider
than any other markup scheme I know of.  That helps a lot in
building a solid foundation that won't fade away.

> But SGML is to mark up text for later formatting to fit the

SGML is explicitly *not* about text formatting.  It is about
marking up documents describing what content *is*, not what to do
with it. If markup represents typesetting instructions, that
markup is good for little else.  If your markup describes what
the content is, you have far more options.

For example, the introduction of a new term in a technical manual
may be rendered in italics.  You could mark it up like: <it>new
term</it> which would be fine if the end target is a typesetter,
but if you mark it up with: <firstterm>new term</firstterm>, you
can still render it as italic, but you can also automatically add
it to the index as the defining location of the term, or in an
on-line environment if you encounter a unfamiliar term, the
search engine can seek out the defining occurence if it exists.

But back to your point:

Yes, though I would argue at length why SGML markup is well worth
the extra effort, I'll also agree that this minimalist approach
to document portability deserves support.

The only hitch for 7-bit ASCII is utf-8, which can be seen as a
convenient way to avoid the explicit conversion process of legacy
data.  If your external storage is utf-8, how can you reliably
tell what has been converted and what has not?

After pondering it for awhile, I cut that section out of my last
post. :)  One sentence summary: some markup scheme cater to human
processing, others to machine processing, and yet others, most
notably programming languages, work hard to satisfy both needs.

BIDI is what I think makes it difficult. Without BIDI, I would be tempted
to stick to local Unix/MAC/DOS conventions for C0 chars, add maybe BOM and
ISS (or whatever).

But BIDI works in blocks. Currently both LS and PS are block separators.
It's been said here that probably LS shouldn't be a BIDI block separator.
That leaves PS. And I have to use it (in partic. if I have both right-
and left-aligned sections). So can I mix PS with LS (or LF) and FF? Looks
funny.

Maybe it is an error to have PS function as both a paragraph separator
(whatever that is -- I too feel it probably comes from WP context) *and*
a BIDI block separator.

Maybe it would have been better to have a BIDI block separator as a
separate Unicode control char, independant of any formatting intents.

Just a thought,

Pierre

Ugh. The relatively few escape sequences at the character level is what
makes Unicode so ATTRACTIVE, esp. to those that currently use escape
sequence based character sets. (Tools to repair broken escape codes in
JIS are almost standard equipment with most Japanese computer systems)
Not to mention the complexity they add to simple and elegant string
manipulation functions... processing escape codes can sometimes bump the
algorithm efficiency up by one O() level.

Put in escape codes at the character level, and Unicode begins to lose
the simplicity factor, and becomes just another mammoth character set
that nobody can or will implement--there are plenty out there. If I
wanted escape sequences, I could choose from a lot of other character
sets that are already out there. 

If you want a complicated character system that does tags and
everything, there are plenty to choose from-- Unicode basher Prof. Ken
Sakamura (U. of Tokyo) and Co. would be more than happy to tout the
virtues of TRON, which is loaded with escape sequences galore. The TRON
project has made a religion out of bad-mouthing Unicode, much like the
computer industry has made a religion out of bad-mouthing a certain
software firm in Redmond, Washington (who make a darn fine Unicode based
OS, I might add). They have to-- they have to justify that the years of
blood, sweat, tears (and most importantly, money) they've used making
-their- worldwide standard character set has not repeated work that's
already here and in use and better.

(see
<URL:http://www.personal-media.co.jp/vs/mltp96/keynote/keynote_e.html>
and
<URL:http://www.super-nova.co.jp/tronshow96/html_e/multi.html>)

Granted, Unicode is complicated. It will get more complicated. This is a
fact of life as representing languages is complicated. But I'd hope the
character level stays as simple as possible, for those that need
simplicity.

I do NOT agree that tags should be at the character level.

Thanks, very useful (esp. for one who didn't have the time to read
all the posts carefully).

I haven't read the MLSF yet (will do this weekend), but I'm sure I
still won't agree with putting this tagging in UTF-8. UTF-8 is nothing
more than one of many possible transformation formats, and it must
always be possible to move between it and UCS-2 and other UTFs. Filters
surely will (and almost certainly already do) exist to transform
between these various CESs. What would they do with language tagging?

Sounds to me like the only possible approach, assuming language tagging
is needed at the plain-text level (I don't have the knowledge to comment
on that).

P.S. What happened to the "unicode plain-text file" thread? Seems it
died very suddenly (with no closure)! Maybe it was displaced by this

It seems as if this is trying to become a plain-text issue.  I hope not.
Plain text is supposed to be a simple sequence of *characters* and minimal
formatting information (hard spaces, line breaks, page breaks, and in the
case of Unicode, directionality indicators), irrespective of language,
containing no mysterious metacodes.  (Let's agree that hard line and page
breaks are not mysterious metacodes.)

In view of the temperature surrounding the language-tagging issue, the
solution is not going to be simple or stable or soon to come, and therefore
I believe it falls outside the scope of plain text, which by definition
should be simple and stable and long-lasting.  Language tags will be
constantly changing and surrounded by politics and emotion.

There are still such things as terminals that use C1 control codes such as

Unicode and terminal-to-host communication will become mutually exclusive

Frank - I understand your concerns. But one way of looking at what we
need is some tagging format possibly used in ACAP and IMAP, which
MUST not leak to other places. And what you probably worry about
is the C1 area in terms of octets (which is already gone with UTF-8)
and not the C1 character space in Unicode, which turns up as two bytes
in UTF-8.

Subject: Re: Comments on <draft-ietf-acap-mlsf-00.txt>

Finally got around to reading the MLSF Internet Draft.
Couple of comments:

1) One thing really made me jump: the first sentence in the Abstract.

      "While UTF-8 solves most internationalization (I18N) problems, ..."

   That makes as much sense to me as saying that QuotedPrintable solves
   most I18N problems for Western Europe. It's not QP which does that,
   it's ISO 8859-1. QP is just one way to encode 8859-1 text so it can
   past most mail relays without corruption. But Base64 is another
   way to do the same thing (which can make statistical sense for some
   languages).

   Similarly, it's not UTF-8 which solves the wider problem of
   world-wide I18N, it's Unicode (and/or ISO 10646). The canonical
   representation of Unicode is 16-bit quantities (UCS-2). UTF-8 is
   nothing more than one of many possible transformations (UTF-7 is
   another that's already defined: RFC 2152). If I understood right,
   UTF-8 was created mainly to make Unicode coexist reasonably well
   with existing OSs that use 8-bit characters, for example Unix.

   Not that I agree with the proposal, but the MLSF Internet Draft
   should make clear what the implications are of trying to put
   language tags into UTF-8 (for example, assumption that UTF-8 becomes
   the canonical representation of Unicode, loss of tagging when
   converting to other CESs). I guess the pros and cons have been
   discussed at length here.

2) It would have been nice to put a few examples of actual UTF-8 strings
   with language tags (in hex of course) in the document.

As to the fundamental issue of whether language tagging belongs in
plain-text Unicode, I must say I'm pretty neutral at this point. I
think they could be useful. But, as Frank was saying, if it's going
to take 10 years to converge to an acceptable solution, then it
doesn't belong in plain text, but at a higher level.

The Unicode standard is clear that escape sequences and controls in
canonical Unicode are encoded using 16-bit codes.  Of course another encoding
system which employs Unicode may choose a different tack.

Subject: UTF-8 in SNMPv3

Hi - 

The SNMPv3 working group of the IETF is hoping to make use of UTF-8
for some human-readable information in the MIBs used to manage SNMPv3.

The convention currently used for this kind of information is described
on page 4 of RFC 1903.  (For easy reference, I've appended the text
to the end of this message.)  We would like to define a new convention
formulated in terms of UTF-8 for use in new MIBs.

What we've not yet reached agreement on is the question of "non-printable
stuff".  Some believe that NVT ASCII's control characters are somehow
less problematic than those of 10646, others find the problems equivalent.
The questions that come to my mind are:

	1) Is there any merit to the argument that the "non-printable
	   stuff" in 10646 is any better or worse than the NVT ASVII
	   definition?

	2) Can we use standard character properties to identify a
	   "printable" subset that would not break for any language?
           (The folks that want these also want to have CRLF...)

Background information:
	In the SNMP protocol notions of equality and ordering have no
	"locale" component.  There is no notion of character equivalence.
	It is very much a "bits is bits" environment.

	The concerns of working group members appear to be arising from:
		1) what does it mean to "support 10646"
		2) how to display "wierd stuff"
		3) how to input "wierd stuff"
		4) the old CR/LF problem

Is there a nice, concise, convincing answer I can take back to the
working group?

 ========== Excerpt from RFC 1903, DisplayString Textual convention ==========
            "Represents textual information taken from the NVT ASCII
            character set, as defined in pages 4, 10-11 of RFC 854.

            To summarize RFC 854, the NVT ASCII repertoire specifies:

              - the use of character codes 0-127 (decimal)

              - the graphics characters (32-126) are interpreted as
                US ASCII

              - NUL, LF, CR, BEL, BS, HT, VT and FF have the special
                meanings specified in RFC 854

              - the other 25 codes have no standard interpretation

              - the sequence 'CR LF' means newline

              - the sequence 'CR NUL' means carriage-return

              - an 'LF' not preceded by a 'CR' means moving to the
                same column on the next line.

              - the sequence 'CR x' for any x other than LF or NUL is
                illegal.  (Note that this also means that a string may
                end with either 'CR LF' or 'CR NUL', but not with CR.)

            Any object defined using this syntax may not exceed 255
            characters in length."

I hope so!  The word "legacy" is emotionally toned and value-laden.
It denigrates 30+ years of computing practice and standards activities,
and it implies that plain text is a relic of the past to be discarded
with all possible haste, and those who haven't done so yet have some
sort of "character" defect.

In fact, plain text is the only immutable format in computing.  GUI
and WYSIWYG formats change faster than anybody can keep up with them,
and information encoded in these formats rapidly becomes inaccessible
(or accessible only by utilities (like UNIX "strings") that extract
the plain text from them, if there is any).

> Does anyone have a better name?

C0 and C1 control characters.  These are ISO standard character sets
and ISO-standard terminology is available to refer to them.

Finally, please remember that Unicode is a plain-text standard.  The
control characters are there for a reason: you need them in plain text.

Agreed.  And the only reason it is not portable is the poor
standardisation of the C0 and C1 control characters.

I've seen the following forms of plain text:

  NL is a line break, there's no paragraphs: Unix
  NL is a line break, NL NL is a paragraph separator: Unix
  NL is a paragraph separator, line breaks are implicit: ports of
    MS-DOS applications to Unix.
  CR LF is a line break: MS-DOS
  CR LF is a paragraph separator, line breaks are implicit: MS-DOS.
  CR LF is a paragraph separator, CR (or was it LF?) is a line break:
    MS-DOS.
  CR is a line break: MacOS.
  CR is a paragraph separator: MacOS.

without counting, of course, systems on which record information is
kept out-of-band (such as VMS).

You need a paragraph separator and possibly a line break (and perhaps
a page break).  Unicode defines well-standardised codepoints for
those.  If you use other control characters, such as SO/SI for
controlling boldface or italics, or BS (or CR) for overstriking, or
terminal control sequences, it ain't plain text no more.

Subject: Re: Superscript asterisk

Being able to do "plain text" math is one of the goals of the Unicode
Technical Committee now. Since the publication of Unicode 2.0, three years
ago, we have had a lot of expert input on what plain text math capabilities
are needed, and also, where our existing repertoire of math operators is
insufficient. (We are, incidentally, also interested in evaluating and
improving our other technical symbol collections, but so far have not had
the long and sustained input from experts in other fields, as we had for
mathematics).

Full layout of mathematical expressions will need some form of markup,
although many formulas that do not need the full generality can be laid out
correctly if the mathematical operator characters in Unicode are
interpreted semantically.

Semantics for formatting that one needs to distinguish e.g. between
summation sign and sigma. They look the same, but summation sign can take
limit expressions etc.

Another aspect of semantics is the mathematical semantics. Here it's
necessary to make enough distinctions so that, if a small and large form of
an operator can occur in the same text, that they can be distinguished by
their character code without recourse to font information. Doing so, allows
plain text searches for math formula.

Caveat: If and where mathematicians have used 'operator overloading', to
borrow a C++ term, and deliberately used the same operator with different
mathemtical meaning in another sub-discipline, we would not sub-divide the
character, as the larger context would be enough to determine its meaning.

Our foremost goal has therefore been to complete our repertoire and where
necessary introduce additional distinctions for the two reasons I mentioned.

In the case of ASTERISK, the analysis that is needed, and that, as far as I
have seen, has not been made, is to present evidence that cases exist (or
are easily conceivable) where *both* the ASCII asterisk and yet another
asterisk are needed in the same text, and with consistent distinction in
use or formatting.

Ricardo has said that one could use the proposed asterisk in conjunction with
the ASCII asterisk do denote a regular expression of zero or more asterisks.
This is the one example that cannot serve, since by extension, it would
require an infinite series of asterisks (suppose I wanted to define a
regular expression consisting of zero or more instances of the proposed
asterisk!).

Typographically, asterisk may indeed show a variation betweem full-size and
superscript forms. For standard text fonts, the full-size form of asterisk
occurs only occasionally.

In the vast majority of fonts on my system, as well as in the Unicode
Standard, and ISO/IEC10646-1, ASTERISK is clearly depicted as a
superscripted symbol (i.e. it's 1/2 height and extends upwards from the
centerline of the font, which is just slightly below the x height). The
asterisk and superscript 2 have the same location and dimension. Therefore,
unless Ricardo is proposing a character that has the same dimension as a
*superscripted* SUPERSCRIPT TWO, my conclusion would be that we already
_have_ the character he wants, and that he is using a poor font for his
purpose.

Actually they served us all rather well considering how few of them
there are and how long they lasted (and continue to last).  We've
covered this ground before...  But (to cite only one example) do you
know how many terminals and terminal emulators are "still" in use?
I would venture to say the number has not declined significantly since
the 1980s.  It might well have increased.  It's just that they are no
longer the *only* form of online access, and they work well, so we
ignore them.

The CR/LF/CRLF confusion is annoying of course, but we've lived with
it all these years, and continue to live with it.  But you're talking
about file formats.  The use of control characters in data communications
is fairly well standardized, pretty much along the lines of a Teletype:
CR moves the print head to the left margin, LF moves it down one line,
and ESC introduces a device-dependent escape or control sequence, etc.

But Unicode and the terminal acess model are not mutually exclusive.
There can be (and are) Unicode-based terminal emulators, capable of
handling (e.g.) UTF-8 on the wire.  And when you have terminal 
communications, you have control characters.  (When you emulate, say,
a VT320, you have LOTS of control characters :-)

The only thing that is clear about "plain text" is that it is not well
defined at all. There is certainly no ISO standard that gives you any
indication of what "plain text" is. The Unix community feels somewhat
confident about the notion of plain text, just because they have editors
such as ed, vi, emacs, etc. that agree on a common text format that is
so simple that it has become customary to refer to it as plaintext.

Many aspects of "plain text" are ill-defined these days:

  a) how do you terminate lines and paragraphs
  b) is there a terminator after the last line/paragraph
  c) is the line formatting the task of the sending or the receiving
     process?

For Unix the answers used to be

  a) LF and no paragraph concept
  b) yes
  c) the sender has to insert line breaks

but thanks to the heterogenity of the Internet, these strict rules have
for some years been weakened significantly in common practice. Some
aspects of the classical Unix plaintext definition (which came
originally from tty output hardware interfaces) do not make sense any
more. For example, the insertation of LFs in the middle of paragraphs,
causes these LFs to move around whenever a few words are changed, which
seriously disrupts revision control systems (e.g., diff and RCS) and it
is not adequate anymore at all today with reformatting web browsers now
being a dominating output device and not 1960s ttys.

I think the Unix community should slowly get used to the idea of
abandoning LFs in the middle of paragraphs in plain text documents and
let the editor and display tool perform the reformatting at display
time.

What a pity.  Perhaps there should be one (no :-)).

The notion of plain text long predates Unix: it was exactly the same,
for example, on the PDP-8, which is where I first learned computing.
(Terminator was CR/LF, and the character code was 7-bit-ASCII-with-8th-bit-
set, for uniformity with Model 33 Teletypes).

AFAIK, the "reformatting web browsers" you refer to do not reformat
plain text at all, which means that infinite-line-length alleged
plain text can be read only with difficulty and much scrolling, and
printing is impossible.

Actually, it tends to be well-defined for each platform.  And then the
interchange methods among platforms tend to converge on a few simple
conventions: ASCII (or the appropriate ISO character set, or now UTF-8 or
other form of Unicode), as opposed to EBCDIC (or Baudot, or Sixbit); CRLFs
separating lines, and paragraphs separated by blank lines.  Somewhat less
well defined, but nevertheless in common use, are bare Carriage Return or
Backspace for overstriking, Formfeed for "new page", and Tab for tabbing
(with several different conventions about tabstops).

Lines are terminated at somewhere between 72 and 80 characters by
convention, because that's how wide terminal screens are, and before them
the Teletype carriage, and before that the most common kind of punchcard.
Or for that matter, typewriters and sheets of paper (A4 or US, take your
pick :-)

To this day, we follow these conventions in newsgroups and email, although
now it might be more a matter of "netiquette" than necessity (as in the
BITNET days, when e-mail was, quite literally, 80-column card images).

These simple conventions let us format our text exactly the way we want to.
We can indent or not, we can put line breaks where we want them, we can have
columns of numbers or other tabular presentations, mathematical expressions,
and idiosyncratic forms of emphasis.  Many people want their text to stay
the way they wrote it.  And many people also are not fond of receiving email
in every kind of bizarre format than any application developer can dream up
when it contains, in fact, nothing but words (but I stray).

But what IS plain text?  Maybe some people might like to have their email
reformatted, but I don't think they want their C or Fortran or PostScript
programs to receive the same treatment.  Nor, for that matter poetry or any
other forms of text where line breaks, indentation, and blank lines serve a
purpose.  As in, for example, the preceding paragraph.

No more plain-text bashing!  No more "legacy" saying!  Our focus should be
not on stamping out plain text, but on promoting international multilingual
communication through a universal character set that does not impose a
a particular modus vivendi upon its users.

When/if it means pararaph separator it's not plain text.  Plain text is
what you TYPE at the DOS prompt.  In such files (e.g. a READ.ME file)
CRLF means Carriage Return (move the cursor to the left margin) and
Line Feed (move the cursor down one row).

That's not a plain-text issue, it's a character encoding and file format
issue.  Ctrl-Z as an EOF indicator is a relic of CP/M, carried forward into
DOS for compatibility, used by some apps and ignored by others.

Two years ago I suggested that we come up with a standard for Unicode plain
text that can be used as a baseline when converting files from DOS, UNIX, the
Macintosh, etc, to Unicode, and that says what control characters (C0, C1,
as well as Line Separator, Paragraph Separator, etc) mean in a plain-text
file or data stream.  We made some good progress but eventually the discussion
fizzled out.  If I can summarize it briefly:

 . Yes, but plain text in this sense is inadequate for representing
   (list of writing systems that need higher-level formatting assistance,
   rendering engines, etc.)

 . Fine, but they need that anyway.  For many other languages, plain text
   is possible, and there should be no reason not to settle on a standard
   representation for it in those cases where it can be used.

If anybody would like to revisit that discussion, I've uploaded it to:

  ftp://kermit.columbia.edu/kermit/e/plain.txt

(about 300K of plain text :-)

My experience is that ASCII plain text is sufficiently well defined but has
been incredibly badly implemented, due in part to the requirement in the
1960s and 1970s for keeping programs as small as possible, and in part to
the rarity of cross-platform file transfer until the 1990s.

The original definition, as John Cowan has pointed out, was anything a
Teletype could reliably render, including overstrikes. Thinking of ASCII as
printer commands rather than text makes it easier to understand the origins
of its problems. (I have used printing terminals and video terminals that
permitted overstrikes, designed for APL in particular and for what you will
in general. Overstriking used to be taught in typing textbooks for creating
signs like cent,  c BS /.

The problems we have with ASCII plain text come mainly from a small set of
common variant practices.

Using CR, LF, or CR/LF as a line or paragraph end
Different tab spacings
Optional line wrap
Formfeed codes vs. computed page breaks
BS = DEL or BS-overstrike

In the past, editors on one platform, or written for one purpose, ignored
all other practices. I use two text editors, Alpha for Macintosh and
Notespad (note extra 's') for Windows, which can handle all of these
variations according to my preferences, including the ability to read and
write text files with Mac, Windows, or Unix line break codes. Notespad even
maintains an extensible list of file types where line breaking is never to
be changed by the editor (mostly programming language source code). Alpha
asks whether to wrap paragraphs when opening files.

That is, we agree on everything except our variant usages.

     As long as e-mail readers cannot correctly reformat messages with bad
line breaks
     (like this), it will be a matter of real necessity.

When I want my text to stay as I wrote it, I put it into a PDF, not a text
file. Others prefer TeX for this purpose, or PostScript.

Yes, it's that old Devil cross-cultural ignorance again. It wouldn't

We raised the question of defining a Unicode plain text format about two
years ago, but nothing seemed to come of it. We also discussed the
possibility of actually *using* Unicode text in this discussion, but
nothing came of that either. Does anyone else here feel excessively
constrained by our lack of glyphs for the characters we talk about? Would
anyone else like to get UTF-8-capable mailers and extensive sets of Unicode
fonts and see what effect they have on our deliberations?

I have made the suggestion before, but here goes again--Alis Technologies
offers a 30-day free trial period of its Tango Browser with Tango E-mail,
downloadable from http://www.alis.com/internet_products/try_form.html. It
runs on Windows 95, 98, and NT. Would anyone care to try it with me?

We all have dealt with these annoyances throughout our careers.  They are
indeed annoying, but not impassible impediments.  Also, let's not mix up:

 . File storage format
 . Interchange format
 . Data entry format

> Using CR, LF, or CR/LF as a line or paragraph end
>
As a line end:
  This is a file storage issue.

As a paragraph end:
  There is no such thing as a paragraph end or paragraph separator in
  traditional plain text.

Here I am sitting at my VT100 terminal, which is plugged in to my UNIX
computer.  I type:

  This is a line

Then I push the Return key (sometimes marked Enter), which sends a Carriage
Return.  I would enter a line in exactly the same way no matter what
computer was on the far end of the wire.  Now:

 . The UNIX terminal driver turns the CR into a LF before giving it
   to the application.  If the application is storing the line into a
   file, the file gets "This is a line<LF>".  Ditto for some other
   operating systems, like AOS/VS.

 . If I had OS-9 on the far end, it would store "This is a line<CR>".

 . If I had TOPS-10, TOPS-20, RT-11, etc, on the far end, it would
   store "This is a line<CR><LF>".

 . If I had VMS, VOS, VM/CMS, MVS/TSO or other complex file system on
   the far end, who knows how the line would be stored -- it depends on
   chosen the file organization and record format.

The point is, it doesn't matter.  Each platform has its own format for
internal use, but a standardized interface to the outside world.  To further
demonstrate this fact, if I then tell the computer on the far end to "type"
or "cat" the file, it will, invariably, send:

  This is a line<CR><LF>

So who cares what the file format is -- except of course when we want to
transfer the file to another platform.  In that case, it is the
responsibility of each file-transfer agent to convert between its peculiar
local format and the common one.  And that is exactly what they do, just
as is done at the terminal/terminal-driver/data-entry level.  FTP and Kermit
are two examples that show it is not that hard to convert plain-text file
record formats from one platform to another.  (And in Kermit's case, the
character set too.)

Of course life would have been simpler if there had been only ONE standard
text-file format used on all platforms.  But the early days of computing
was a time of "Let the Hundred Flowers Bloom", and they did.  Now, however,
we are in a position to start over, and it is an opportunity we are not
likely to have again.

> Different tab spacings
>
I used to say this too, but the last platform I know about that did not
assume tabstops at 1,9,17,25,... was MULTICS.  Of course tabs are variable
in word processors, etc, but that is not plain text.

> Optional line wrap
>
This is a feature of the terminal or the application, not of "plain text".
Files that do not contain line breaks and must rely on some form of
postprocessing to insert line breaks at appropriate points is not really
plain text, it is "input for a text formatter".  Prior to the advent of
word processors, the idea of "long line as paragraph" never came up.

> Formfeed codes vs. computed page breaks
>
Page breaks are an issue worth discussing, and we discussed them at some
length two years ago.  Basically, you can let your "rendering engine" or
printer driver insert them for you, or you can insert them yourself.  One
should be allowed the choice.  (Why would anybody want "hard" page breaks?
Because they are printing paychecks, invoices, envelopes, etc.)

> BS = DEL or BS-overstrike
>
This is a data entry issue, unless you mean including BS in a file for
overstriking.  But in that case, there is never any confusion between BS and
DEL, since DEL is never used for that purpose.  In other words, the only
confusion is at data entry, and this is entirely irrelevant to the
definition of plain text.

What does "correctly reformat messages" mean?  How can your mail client read
my mind?  How does it know that the message I sent you was not already
formatted exactly the way I wanted it?

Notice that to illustrate my point, I need your original formatting (above)
preserved, with the "> " quote indicators added at the left margin, and with
my emphasis added under the appropriate words.  What is a "correct" mail
client supposed to do with this?  Something like this?:

    > As long as e-mail readers cannot correctly
    reformat messages with bad > line breaks
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > (like this),
    it will be a matter of real necessity.

No, a correct email client will leave it alone.  Whether I want my email
reformatted by your client should be my choice, since only I know what my
intentions are in sending it.

Granted, plain text requires some minimal level of agreement, for example
that your screen is 72 (or 76, or 79) columns wide.  I maintain that this
convention is universal, except for Kanji, etc, which are displayed in two
character cells each.  People who use email, netnews, and other forms of
open, interplatform communication have learned these conventions.  We use
them ourselves on this mailing list.  Those of us who do not are often
excoriated for our antisocial behavior.

Especially when we send email or netnews in some application-specific
format, assuming that everybody else uses the same platform and applications
we do.

Yes, that's what I meant, thanks.  (All of us here recognize the
shortcomings of ASCII -- that's why we're here!  But let's not forget that
ASCII can be used to write, say, Fortran programs that can handle far more
in the way of mathematics than the repertoire of ASCII might suggest, and
that people send Fortran-like expressions back and forth in email, etc,
which could easily lose their meaning when reformatted.)

My point exactly.  And how do I read your PDF if I don't have a PDF reader?
(Don't say "get one" -- I'm reading your mail on a DOS PC or a PDP-11, or a
Cray supercomputer.)  How do I read TeX if I don't have the software?  How
do I read PostScript if I don't have a PostScript printer or rendering
engine.  But the crucial point is:

      How will I read your PDF file 200 years from now, when
      PDF itself has been consigned to the "legacy" trashheap
      for the past 195 years?

Then let's try again.  Let me get the ball rolling with the following simple
suggestion for Unicode Plain-Text File and Interchange Format:

A monospaced character-cell display device is assumed for the purposes of
line breaking.  Characters that are too wide for a character cell (such as
Kanjis) occupy a double-width cell.  Of course, Unicode Plain Text can also
be displayed on any other kind of device, in any font, monospaced or not, in
which case "all bets are off", just as they are now with traditional plain
text when displayed in a proportional font.

Conversely, it is recognized that a monospaced (or duospaced) character-cell
device might be inadequate for display of certain writing systems, such as
Arabic or Indic scripts, and in this case intelligent rendering engines
might very well be required.  This should, nevertheless, be possible with
plain text, without the aid of any particular markup scheme.

Plain text is composed only of Unicode characters, with no meta-level
of formatting information, presentation hints, etc, except:

 1. Spaces, such as U+0020 and U+00A0, which are are "kept" (e.g. 
    adjacent spaces are not collapsed).

 2. Horizontal Tabs are indicated by the HT character, U+0009.  Tab
    stops shall be assumed every 8 columns, starting at the first.  (This
    provision is primarily to facilitate conversion of ASCII and 8-bit
    text to Unicode.  Alternatively, it would be OK to force all
    horizontal alignment to be accomplished by spaces.)

 3. Line breaks are indicated by Line Separator, U+2028.  Preformatted
    text must break lines at column 79 or less to avoid unwanted
    reformatting.  Column numbers are 1-based, relative to the left or
    right margin, according to the previaling directionality, with
    single-width characters as the counting unit.  A line break is
    required at the end of the final line if it is to be considered a
    line.  (This is to allow append operations to work in the expected
    fashion.)

 4. Paragraph breaks are indicated by two successive Line Separators
    or by Paragraph Separator, U+2029.

 5. Hard page breaks are indicated by FF, U+000C.

C0 and C1 control characters other than HT and FF have no function
whatsoever in Unicode Plain Text.  (If there were Unicode Horizontal Tab and
Page Break characters, we wouldn't need C0 at all; however, the UTC -- or at
least members of it, in previous discussions -- indicated that there is no
good reason to duplicate the C0 characters that are already in Unicode.)

A Unicode plain-text "rendering engine" shall not mess with the format of a
plain-text file except, optionally, at the user's discretion, to wrap lines
that are longer than the display or printing device.  Higher-level rendering
engines, of course, can do whatever they want.

Why are you specifying font characteristics for plain text?

And then saying that you don't really need a monospace font and it is
still plain text even when you have to do a proper job of rendering it?

I don't see how barring all the other spacing and presentation codes
(e.g. ZWNJ) improves plain text.

I don't see how specifying the maximum text width is in the purview of
"plain text."  That is suggesting that running my terminal in 132 column
mode (or printing on wide paper/with narrow fonts,) involves something
special.  I suspect that all the attention to cell widths, column
counting and what not is to make tab processing map nicely to the
character cell terminal model.  That model is responsible for some
horrible hacks when it migrated to other countries and I believe the
difficulties in adapting software that depends on it to writing systems
it does not work for has been a serious drag on more advanced Unicode
implementations.

If we are supporting Unicode and have a notion of Paragraph it seems
reasonable to specify it is denoted with U+2029.

Only for purposes of getting across the idea that "long line = paragraph,
break where you please" should not be considered well-formed plain text.
Or, to look at it the other way, that plain text must allow for hard line
breaks, and there should be a convention as to how long we might reasonably
expect lines to be.  "Columns" are the only measurement that makes sense
(surely not picas, inches, millimeters, pixels, ...) and this presupposes 
fixed spacing. 

This might be a farfetched notion except that it is completely consonent
with current practice.

The fact that monospaced fonts have fallen out of fashion should not cloud
our judgement.  Naturally they present some difficulties for multilingual
text, but they also provide numerous benefits.  They let me compose a text
document that anybody can read in -- barring "rendering engine" interference
-- the same form in which I composed it.  Tables line up, columns of numbers
add up, comments in my C program are aligned, etc.  All this without our
having to agree in advance on which rendering engine or markup language to
use.

Parenthetically, look at the mess the craze for the typeset appearance has
gotten us into.  If I want to make a table on a Web page or in a typeset
document, I have to use some kind of markup language or "table" package,
rather than just spacing or tabbing the items appropriately.  Which is fine
until you consider that any markup language or tables package you are using
today will be long forgotten a few years from now, and so your laboriously
constructed document will either require conversion or be lost forever (or
humans will need to read the markup language directly).

As noted, I grant that the monospace-font model does not apply equally well
to all writing systems, but for the many to which it does apply -- Roman,
Hebrew, Cyrillic, Armenian, Greek, Georgian, etc, and to some extent CJK
since, at least in Japan, they have been using mono- and duospaced fonts on
terminals and PCs for decades, and care as much about things lining up as
anybody else -- should guidelines not be stated up front?

They aren't barred -- they are Unicode characters that are not C0 or C1

I suppose you're right about the intention.  That's what the discussion is
for -- to find suitable language for expressing a model for "text that is
already formatted and stands on its own without additional formatting from
any higher intelligence and that can displayed by the most minimalistic
plain-text viewer", like this email message.

You might be right about specifying a maximum line length.  And yet,
if there is to be such a thing as preformatted plain text, and none of us
can deny that there already is such a thing since this is how we commicate,
should there not be some form of guideline as to what is a safe default
line-length, in the absence of any prior agreement to set a different one?
That's what we do now, implicitly.  Why not make it explicit?  So how should
the guideline be expressed?

Let's assume you are composing some plain text, and you don't care how it's
rendered.  Then don't include Line Separators and let the viewer "flow" the
text.  That's fine for ordinary prose, but it assumes a viewer that knows
how to flow text, and I'm not sure that a text-flowing viewer should be
assumed or required.  As somebody mentioned earlier, most printers will
truncate long lines, as will many terminals and other display devices.

If you do care how the text is rendered, include Line Separators.

The problem I am having with Frank's suggestions boil down
essentially this:

The Unicode concept of plain text is of a text stream consisting
only of Unicode characters, interpreted according to the rules
of the standard, and not including (or not interpreting the
inclusion of) higher-level markup, however expressed. It does
not involve specification of particular font behavior (including
monospacing), details of terminal interaction, or line length.

It is that concept of Unicode plain text that we intend and
hope will be stable for the next century. Given the text stream
itself, basic textual content should be derivable, although not
necessarily any detailed layout information.

The intended invariant is textual content, rather than document
form including textual content.

To specify invariant document form, it is clear that a higher-level
protocol must be specified. And I see Frank's Unicode plain text
proposal as just the bare-bottom, minimal common denominator for
a document description standard. In that respect it is no different
from PDF, except in complexity and faithfulness to original appearance
of a document in all details.

Some of the difficulty of this discussion, of course, derives from
the fact that the Unicode Standard unavoidably had to contain some
bare minimum of format control characters. We have had to specify
format semantics for CR, LF, TAB, VT, FF because there was no way
we were going to get from the past to the future without people
converting existing documents using these (or carrying analogous
practice into new documents); and LS and PS were added to provide
a minimum, unambiguous set of format controls to organize plain
text. Bidi format controls were added because they had to be: otherwise,
you run into situations where intended content is inexpressible, or
existing content is uninterpretable in plain text.

And on the other hand, the situation is muddied by plain text markup
conventions where the markup is carried around in the plain text:

<TR>
<TD>9/23/98</TD>
<TD>38 widgets sold</TD>
<TD align=right>65,416</TD>
<TD align=center>---</TD>
<TD align=right>65,416</TD>
</TR>

Where the "plain text" is:

"<TR>NLF<TD>9/23/98</TD>NLF<TD>38 widgets sold</TD>NLF<TD ali
gn=right>65,416</TD>NLF<TD align=center>---</TD>NLF<TD align=
right>65,416</TD>NLF</TR>"

But the plain text of the content is 5 strings:

"9/23/98"  "38 widgets sold"  "65,416"  "---"  "65,416"

And the full document desription is, of course, not just these
5 strings, but includes the fact that they constitute a row embedded in 
a table, and are aligned in specified ways within the cells in that row.

The Unicode vision is that the character encoding standard itself
should be as robust and useful in its larger domain as the 7-bit ASCII
standard was in its own contrained textual domain.

But given the enormous complexities that are inherent in trying to
deal with *all* of the writing systems of the world, it is inevitable
that plain text *layout* conventions involving Unicode are going to
be considerably more complex than plain text *layout* conventions
involving ASCII only. At the bare minimum, for example, plain text
in Unicode *must* take bidirectional layout into account--otherwise,
you would be saying that you could express Unicode content in plain
text, as long as you avoided Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac characters.

In some respects, the entire content of the Unicode Standard beyond
just the code charts and names lists is an elaborate attempt to
describe what it means to deal with plain text layout and interpretation
for all of the Unicode characters. It cannot be encapsulated in
the kind of constraints that Frank has suggested, in my opinion.

See below for comments on maximum line length.  When considering why other
measurements were inappropriate I realized it is because "preformatted"
plain text has no control over font size and thus cannot do position
based formatting as someone would do on a sheet of paper.  The cell
model allows people to position text without recourse to a markup system
but at the sacrafice of which scripts can be properly rendered.  It
happens that many of the commercially significant languages can cope
with the cell model which is part of the reason it has survived so long.
Unfortunately it just helps keep the hard writing systems in the ghetto
because it isn't nearly as profitable and requires dealing with many
cans of worms when trying to fit them to a system that depends on
implicit positioning.

Presumably the markup language specifies the semantics well enough to be
rendering engine independent - if the rendering engine is capable of
displaying the text as described.  For text that is being sent without
any markup, then monospace for the bulk of the text is probably what
the reader should use (at least if they believe the text to have
horizontal structure.)  I just don't think that it should be enforced.

As for the concerns about the ephemeral nature of markup languages,
hopefully we will someday reach some stability for systems that
don't require a proprietary encoder, do not require extensive
computer training to grok and do not have flavour of the week
problems.  These difficulties are not inherent in the design of
markup languages but an artifact of the political and economic
forces driving them.

Because if it is made explicit, software writers will feel free to take
such a limit as a hard one and do silly things for text that exceeds it.
Right now most software will handle long lines albeit sometimes awkwardly.
If someone preformats their text for 200 columns, then that is what they
should get if the output device can cope.  If it cannot, they need to
consider why they think it has to be 200 columns.  In the case of Usenet
and public mailing lists people have to curtail their lines if they don't
want them mangled.

OK, then perhaps the idea of "recommended maximum line length" is an
unnecessary complication.  Perhaps it is enough to say that Line
Separator means what it says.  If I put one in my text, then it means
to start a new line.  If I make sure that there are no more than 79
characters between line separators (or whatever else is appropriate
to my writing system), I'll get the desired effect.

Right, of course.  But we can we trust the market to settle on a simple
standard for plain text?  Of course not; there's no money in it.

Does the market want an immutable standard for plain-text documents that
can last for a century or an eon?  Of course not.  The market wants
everything to change all the time, so everybody will have to "upgrade"
constantly.

That's great for business but bad for preservation of history and 
culture.  And it shortens the productive lives of "content providers".
There are ways to make money that don't require artificially induced
instability.

Furthermore, I would not like to think that in the Unicode world of
the future, that it will not be possible to send preformatted email
or netnews without the assistance of some specific markup language
or embedded proprietary word-processor codes.  Email has already
deteriorated significantly from its original openness thanks to MIME's
blessing of any kind of proprietary gewgaw any vendor wants to add
to their GUI email clients.  Thus a perfect application for Unicode
plain text would be as a MIME type, specifically intended to proclaim
and promote the adherence to a simple, universal, vendor-independent,
self-contained standard.  Hopefully the IETF would have the sense to
see the value of a Unicode successor to RFC822.

So I'd like to see a definition for plain text in the Unicode standard,
that is totally independent of any external product, that allows a
file or stream of Unicode text to stand on its own, for all time, and
retain a minimum level of formatting, in those cases where the author
of the text feels formatting is important.  (In fact, all of us do,
otherwise we wouldn't care so much about fonts and rendering engines
and markup languages).  I think email and netnews are two areas where
the need for such a standard is evident.

This would be a fine standard.  However, it doesn't have to be part of the
_Unicode_ standard, and I don't think it belongs as a normative part of
Unicode.  As minimal as it may be, it still falls into the domain of file
formats and "higher-level protocol".

It's a tribute to the success of Unicode that people want to piggyback on
it's success to solve closely related problems.

Hehe, not even that, since when you pull the "carriage return lever" to return 
the carriage to the left margin, the ratchet setting (for single space
or double space) automatically feeds the line (or lines) on the platen to the
ratchet stop before the lever locks and allows you to drag the
carriage back.

So nice try, but CRLF was already mechanically automated decades ago.

The Teletypes did, up through at least the KSR 33 and ASR 35, at least.
That's why CR and LF were made part of the control character set...

[much snippage]

There cannot be an enforceable line length limit on plain text. One of the
uses of plain text is for database interchange, where any number of fields
of any length, plus separators, may constitute a line.

On looking through the remainder of this message, I conclude that I
disagree with Frank's attempts to make his own limited experience
normative, but I heartily agree that his proposal for a bottom-level plain
text Unicode format is on the right track, and that it allows us to deal
with some of the issues listed above as file format issues, specifically
line and paragraph ends and other control codes. Tab stops, wrapping, and
page breaking must be left to the user's choice when rendering, since they
are not file format issues.

Here *I* am, sitting at my Mac, and recalling what I have been doing on an
NT system and Silicon Graphics Indy and O2 computers running Irix for the
last year and a half, when I was shuttling files back and forth between
them. (The Indy is used as an embedded controller in a 750 kg laser
microscope system for semiconductor wafer inspection, and the O2 to run the
microscope software without the hardware for demos and simulations, none of
which matters to this discussion.)

Whereas my VT100 simulator used to get its CR from the keyboard buffer,
where it was deposited after the keyboard driver translated from the
keyboard scan codes. Anyway, input technology is not at issue here.

Your cultural ignorance/sheltered life-experience is showing. *You* may
live in an environment where these changes are made automatically, but a
lot of us don't.

And since I don't use a VT100 simulator anymore, I only encounter this
issue when transfering files to another platform, and as a result I care
all the time.

Yes, yes, everything *could* have been made to work, except for the parts
that couldn't, you see, because management wouldn't allow the extra time
and space required to make things portable, or worse still, was trying to
lock customers into proprietary data formats.

Your limited experience again. I have rarely used an editor with fixed tab
stops since about 1982 (EDLIN, IIRC). I once knew the escape sequences for
IBM, Diablo, and Qume *printing* terminal tab settings by heart.

>> Optional line wrap
>>
>This is a feature of the terminal or the application, not of "plain text".

This is a feature found in ASCII *files* which were written either with or
without explicit line breaks, requiring a choice for appropriate
rendering--a choice which the editor should be able to make, but which the
user should actually make.

But the text editor is frequently the chosen text reformatter. You are
still claiming that text files as they occur in your computer subculture
are for some reason normative for the rest of us.

Word processing began in the 1960s. I gather you had a later date in mind.
Did you mean specifically WYSIWYG word processors, invented at Xerox in the
late 1970s?

If we can establish that general principle and apply it to the previous
cases, the problem will be solved in short order. The application
determines the requirements for tab stops, page breaks, and paragraph or
line formatting.

I mean that it should have the ability to reformat such badly broken text,
to use when I decide. Right now I have to reformat such text by hand, or
leave it severely broken. Well, maybe I should learn Perl, but I prefer
that someone else learn Perl and write the routines I and many others need.
If any reader is interested, the spec is as follows.

1) Reflow paragraphs, removing extra white space, while preserving quoting
marks '>' in the left margin. Don't get confused by angle brackets in the
text.

2) Realign tables with "tab damage". Tables that are too wide should be
broken into pages, rather than having lines folded.

If you can manage those two, you're good, and I have some more little jobs
for you. E-mail users will be eternally grateful (for a week or two,
anyway, on Net time).

However, it actually is the recipient's choice, and you can't stop us. The
"correct" reformatting I had in mind would look like this.

Universal, of course, except where it isn't, you know. No matter where we
set the right margin, text quoted from e-mails will break against it if it
can't be reflowed.

How do you express a vector inner product in FORTRAN? In TeX it's something
like $\Sigma_(i=0)^n a_i \times b_i$, and in APL it's nearly "A+.xB", but
with a real times symbol.

No, your point was that ASCII text files stay formatted the way you write
them. That would be true, I suppose, if we agreed with you that we could
outlaw differences in tab stops, line breaking, and other options on
different platforms, because your subworld is normative and there aren't
any variant practices worthy of consideration.

Yes, we had the same problem with SGI Irix 5.2, which doesn't support a PDF
reader. But the field engineers have Windows on their laptops, so it's only
a problem for the user manual, not the service manual, and only becomes
vitally important in paperless fabs.

along with ASCII, 8859, and 2022, and all of our removable storage media.
Do you know someone with a functioning Teletype paper tape reader who can
read legacy ASCII files from 1970? What would you suggest I archive my
life's work on for the ages to come (if anyone cares)?

>Then let's try again.  Let me get the ball rolling with the following simple
>suggestion for Unicode Plain-Text File and Interchange Format:
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following discusses a file format and a number of rendering options,
but fails to address interchange. UTF-8 is usually recommended for
interchange, since it avoids the Endianness question, but transfer of files
in other encodings will occur, and must be provided for.

The file format must define permitted character codes and code sequences. I
suggest that we permit any character code that can represent a character,
even if no character is defined for that code, but that we not permit
unmatched surrogate characters or codes which are defined not to have the
possibility of representing a character. Error behavior for the rendering
process when there are illegal codes or code sequences can be undefined, or
we could specify error messages and continuation policies.

The display rendering process does not change the file, so any display
options such as word wrap, tab stops, character width, ligatures, combining
characters, and so on are orthogonal to the file format. The user can
change the text and save in the new form, but the software isn't allowed to
on its own.

Rendering behavior of control codes and other non-printing characters must
be defined.

>A monospaced character-cell display device is assumed for the purposes of

>Kanjis) occupy a double-width cell.

Users may choose to display all characters in cells of the same width, or
to mix single- and double-cell display. Note that this is not the same as
half-width and full-width CJK characters, which have been defined as
separate characters.

Specifically, we will permit rendering in ATSUI on the Mac, in Java, on
NT2K, in Plan 9, and on other platforms, all with whatever level of Unicode
rendering and fonts happen to be available, and we will specify what should
happen for missing characters, lack of BIDI capability, lack of ligatures,
etc.

For some purposes a monospaced LTR rendering of these characters may be
useful, and is permitted as a user option and as a fallback.

But with the use of Unicode markup characters, such as explicit ordering
and joining characters.

As on a typewriter, we have no control of the user's tab stop settings. I
recommend that we legislate alignment of monospaced text using spaces only,
and forget HT. That's what I have taught people to do for tabular e-mail
such as resumes.

At present software is free to truncate long lines, wrap at the last
column, or word wrap. I would recommend that we forbid truncation and allow
the user to choose wrapping style.

The following non-printing characters may occur in the file, but will be
treated as unavailable characters.
     U+206A INHIBIT SYMMETRIC SWAPPING
     U+206B ACTIVATE SYMMETRIC SWAPPING
     U+206C INHIBIT ARABIC SHAPING
     U+206D ACTIVATE ARABIC SHAPING
     U+206E NATIONAL DIGIT SHAPES
     U+206F NOMINAL DIGIT SHAPES
Unicode Standard 2.0 describes them as "Alternate format characters (usage
strongly discouraged)"

Behavior for unavailable characters should be defined. Options include a
single glyph for any unavailable character, glyphs indicating the code
block of unavailable characters, and numeric rendering.

Behavior for non-printing characters with no semantic significance in plain
text should be defined. Should they be treated as unavailable characters,
or as though they aren't there?

A growing number of standards specify the use of Unicode text files,
without explicitly defining them. If we get anywhere with this, we will
have to run our proposal past these other groups, including the IETF, the
POSIX committee, programming language standards committees, etc.

Are you berating me? You didn't ask me for "clues for berating Frank", just
who I am. Do you mean that my experience is irrelevant in discussing his
experience?

Frank? Am I being mean to you? Is my criticism too harsh? If so, I

Frank's "limited experience" is not youth but insularity. He cites
practices current on UNIX systems as though they applied universally.

I have used UNIX, DOS, Windows, CP/M, Apple ][, IBM mainframes via
timesharing, and several other kinds of computers, dealing with character
set problems well outside Frank's range of experience. I forgot to mention
that I instigated and managed a software development project for a highly
portable APL that came out in English, French, German, Finnish, Russian,
and Japanese, on a variety of computer architectures.

hmm (though the nearest dictionary does not convey this, my sense of
'berating' is related to the repetition of the "limited experience".

There are indeed degrees here - but then we can argue about shades of meaning.

It doesn't make a good argument - and most of your listeners stop at that
point.  (If you wish to be convincing, leave that out and point out the
places where his posting leaves out information - and _why_ that is more
important than than what he's presenting).

I wouldn't be surprised if many people on this list have also used
a variety of systems (otherwise they'd not be reading this list ;-).

I suppose so - but APL itself has little to do with the natural language
aspect (perhaps you managed the message library - that would be relevant
to your statement).

I'm puzzled by this:

1. Precomposed accented characters, I have read, are included in support of
legacy character sets; the ideal is to use a combining accent with a
non-accented character.

2. There are issues with combining accents needing to account for the
height of the base letter, dots, as well, no doubt, as ascenders and
descenders. These are semantic issues, which should be handled by the
software.

3. Unicode, it is said, is a plain text standard.

(2) and (3) seem to be at odds, unless programs that display plain text
become a lot more sophisticated.

Just so.

I don't know what you mean by "semantic".  They are *rendering* issues,
which must be handled by displaying-and-printing software.   Much
other software doesn't care a bit.  For example, you can write
Java code with comments and identifier names in Yoruba, using combining
characters as needed.

So it is.

So they must, if they are to handle all of Unicode: BIDI, conjoining
Hangul jamo, etc. etc.  This is the escape from your dilemma.

Yes! Don't consider simple scripts like Latin only. If one likes to have
plain text Arabic, what should he do?  He needs sofisticated software to
do that.  Unicode is there for all scripts.  When it sees that some
processing is needed for scripts like Arabic or Devanagari, it allows some
processing for scripts like Latin, to solve ambiguities etc.

I'm not sure why my experience has become an issue in this discussion but
I can assure you I have a fair amount.  My first programming experience
was with plugboards and little wires on IBM EAM equipment.  My current
project, now in its 18th year, is precisely the interchange of text among
divergent platforms, with full conversion of both record format and
character set.  I have written software to do this that has run, at one
time or another, on more than 700 different hardware-and-OS platforms,
many long dead, and at present on more than 150.  This project, which I
manage, also produces (and/or collects and distributes, and supports)
similar software written by other people both here and abroad, and the
entire collection spans practically every computer and operating system
that has existed over the past 25-30 years with just a few exceptions.

Part of the project is the definition of a protocol for meaningful text
transfer.  The protocol requires conversion of local formats and character
sets to standard ones when sending, and the reverse procedure when
receiving.  Only international standard character sets are used on the
wire, and are tagged using standard ISO-registered identifiers.  This
protocol has been in production for more than 10 years and is used in many
parts parts of the world, especially Eastern and Western Europe, Isreal,
Greece, the former USSR, Japan, and the Americas.

One of the key questions in designing and implementing such a protocol is
"what is a text file?"  What distinguishes it from a non-text, or "binary"
file?  Constant day-to-day experience with a worldwide user base helps me
to form what I hope is an adequate grasp of the issues.

Of course.  One of the biggest problems facing any of us who wishes to live
in a world of computing diversity is the failure of file system designers to
develop a rational method for tagging files, and indeed, for developing
standard interchange formats.  That's what we're trying to do here.

Consider a minimal platform like DOS.  You can set up your DOS system to
load different code pages, such as CP850 for West European languages, CP866
for Cyrillic, and so on.  Then you can use standard DOS utilities to create
and edit text files in many languages (but only one per file).  However, no
record is kept of the encoding (character set) of each file.  This presents
rather significant problems even when we stay on the PC, before we ever
think about interchanging files.

So at minimum, a text file should be tagged according to character set.  To
my knowledge, this has never been done at the file-system level.

What about file type and record format?  Data interchange can be done in
various ways.  One way involves cooperating agents at each end -- e.g. FTP
client and server.  They can use their own application-specific protocol
to control the process.  For example, one can say "I'm DOS" and the other
"I'm UNIX" and then apply the appropriate conversions.  Of course as
platforms multiply, we have an n x n problem.  Therefore we settle upon
standard formats to be used on the wire.  Each transfer partner converts to
and from these standard formats.

Moving files by magnetic media present numerous problems, but only because
we have forgotten how to do it.  Back in the 1970s, ANSI developed standards
for data interchange by magnetic media (e.g. ANSI X3.26-1978) that worked
perfectly well until the personal computer revolution came along and
standards went out of style.  A DOS (or Macintosh or IRIX or any other)
diskette is simply not intended for export to other platforms.

This is the kind of situation we would like to avoid in the future.  Hence
this discussion.

Actually I am attempting to achieve an agreement a precise definition of
Unicode plain text that allows the text to be already formatted, one that
gives us the same capability that we have always had with ASCII (and Latin-x
etc) of encoding and presenting information without *requiring* the use of
any higher intelligence beyond what is needed to interpret Space, LS, PS,
HT, and FF characters, plus whatever else is needed to accommodate bidi,
etc.

And, before it, NLS, used at government research institutes in the 1960s.
But again, that's not plain text.  It's "input for a text formatter".  It
does not stand on its own.

This sounds like quibbling but it's an important point.  If I have the
capability to compose and format a plain-text message exactly as I want you
to see it, the mail system should allow me to mark it as "preformatted plain
text" and then you would have to go out of your way to reformat it.  Whereas
if my mail client sends long lines with no formatting, it should mark it as
"plain text to be flowed".

Email issues, especially MIME, are a whole new topic, and a controversial
one, best avoided here.  But a clear statement from the Unicode Consortium
on plain text that addresses the issue of formatting might motivate the
"email community" to deal with these issues in a productive way.

Good.  Let's try to keep making progress.

We all have an intuitive grasp of the meaning of preformatted plain text.
You'll find it in many places:

 . READ.ME files on your software disks.

 . Program source code.

 . Traditional (not "legacy") email and netnews.

 . Voluminous full-text information already online.

and so on.  We should find a way to carry this notion forward for Unicode
in a way that:

 . Avoids the pitfalls of platform-dependent formatting conventions.

 . Allows straightforward and unambiguous conversion of 8-bit data to
   Unicode (and, to the extent possible, vice-versa).

 . Is independent of any higher-level protocol, markup language,
   product, or even standard.  In other words, the Unicode definition
   should stand entirely on its own so that files encoded (or transmitted)
   in this format will be universally understood for years, decades,
   centuries to come, no matter what else might change, as long as Unicode
   itself lives on.

Just for the record, let me quickly introduce your discussion partners:

Frank da Cruz <fdc@watsun.cc.columbia.edu>, whom you attested "limited
experience" in the field of inter-platform plaintext exchange, is the
author of KERMIT. KERMIT is a widely ported classic terminal emulator
with build-in file transmission software. It is most likely available on
*all* the platforms that you have ever used, and as the implementor of
KERMIT's text-file transmission mechanism, Frank certainly had to worry
about the plain text file conventions used on all these systems. He his
probably one of the most qualified experts on matters related to the
emulation of historic data-entry terminals and inter-platform plain-text
format convention. (In case you have never used or heard about KERMIT,
please draw the appropriate conclusions regarding the scope of your own
experience.)

Thomas Dickey <dickey@clark.net> is the maintainer of xterm, probably
the currently most widely used VT100 terminal emulator on this planet,
and the application that primarily has to process all plaintext on Unix
workstations in the end. (If you have never heard of xterm, same
conclusion.)

Indeed.  The GNU utilities go to great lengths to process all 256 bytes
even in purely text utilities, but none of them (except specific conversion
programs) handle multibyte text.

Either that, or there needs to be only one character set!

We'll have to deal with multiple untagged codepages/encodings/charsets for a
long time yet. It's unlikely we'll get file systems to carry any
meta-information beyond the filename in any portable way and certainly not
retroactively. 

What we CAN do is use encoding signatures for all Unicode files. The various
forms of Unicode are still relatively new and we still have a chance to
establish the conventions.

The Unicode standard lists signatures for _some_ Unicode encodings, in
section 13.6 Specials, Encoding Form Signature:

UCS-2(UTF-16)  FE FF
UCS-4          00 00  FE FF

However, this is incomplete. The most important thing we're missing from the
standard is:

UTF-8		   EF BB BF

These are all the ZERO WIDTH NO BREAK SPACE (a.k.a BYTE ORDER MARK) in the
corresponding representation.

Without a signature for UTF-8, you can't reliably assume you're working with
UTF-8 and not some other MBCS. A number of Microsoft programs (Notepad,
Visual Studio, richedit) are using this signature for UTF-8.

For the rest of what constitutes "plain text", the Unicode standard covers
most of the issues, but not  explicitly in one place. The grayer part of
this discussion is about what constitutes "preformatted plain text". I don't
think this can be standardized to practical effect. That is, you could write
a standard, but would anyone use it? This quickly gets into the domain of
presentation and document structure, which is beyond the scope of the
Unicode standard proper. It is still worthwhile to capture the common
conventions and make recommendations.

And I most emphatically recommend against using filenames for this
purpose for at least the following reasons:

 . Different platforms have different filename formats and restrictions
   as to what can be in a filename, how long it can be, etc.

 . There is no central registry for filename associations.  Horrible
   confusion arises when different software vendors choose the same
   association for two different products or, worse, when files are
   transferred across platforms that have different associations.

Those who needed a guaranteed way to record preformatted plain text in
documents that can persist over long periods of time and across all
applications and platforms would use it.

Even now, there exists such a standard, albeit unwritten, for 8-bit text.
For example, almost every word processor and web browser has a "Save as"
option for "plain text with line breaks" which, in the general case, is the
only reliable interchange format.  What will be the Unicode equivalent?

I emphatically agree. I meant to say that the name is the only information
you can expect a file system to maintain apart the data in the file. I did
not mean to imply that the name should be used to encode any other
information. If I did, I would have proposed a notation. 

Without a reliable means to capture the encoding external to the bits in the
file itself, I suggest the standardization of Unicode file signatures. These
are already in common use except for UTF-8, and it's useful to extend the
practice to UTF-8.

Exactly the same, except Unicode data intead of 8-bit MBCS data. 

So let's write down the unwritten!

could one not use C0 or C1 characters for these, so that the conventions
could equally apply to say 8859 character sets? 

3) could be something like one out of 3:

1. CR
2. LF
3. CR LF


4) could we use something like one of the C0 characers for that?

They could be, but I think we want to standardize on true Unicode characters
whenever we can, since we have the power to define their semantics.  The C0
and C1 sets are included for compatibility with existing sets over which the
Unicode Consortium has no control, and over which we have been haggling the
past few days ("the Mac does this, the PC does that, UNIX does something
else"...)

Anyway, we can't go back and change existing Latin-Alphabet or PC Code Page
files to use consistent record formats -- that's an operating system and
programming language issue, not to mention a conversion task that not even
Hercules (or Xena) could handle.

This is exactly why we should use LS rather than any of the above in
Unicode text.  Then converting existing 8-bit text to Unicode will have
the happy by-product of erasing these differences.

As noted previously, I would not object to adding two more "control
characters" to Unicode to remove our dependence on C0 and C1 completely:

 1. UHT "Unicode Horizontal Tab", which is just like C0 HT except that
    the tabstops are well-defined (should the tabbing concept be
    carried forward into Unicode Plain Text, rather than using only
    spaces).  How to define them is, of course, another question.

 2. UFF "Unicode Form Feed", like C0 Formfeed, except not in C0.

I can't think of any applications for C0 Form Feed other than page feed
or page eject, or the analogous action on video terminals, namely clear
screen.  But I'm sure that C0 FF has been misused in ways I never heard
of and therefore a more clearly defined Unicode version might be warranted.

However, I'm perfectly happy to stick with C0 HT and FF as long as they
are given precise definitions for Unicode Plain Text, and nobody says
"legacy" when referring to them :-)

Whatever is chosen, let's keep it simple.

I agree with John. The interchange standard should be UTF-8 or UTF-16. The
sending and receiving systems should handle conversions. If the receiving
system does not tag files, and uses just one encoding, it should convert
the file as best it can.

This way, the receiving system does not need to recognize a large number of
character sets, only those it wishes to support.

Since the meaning of CR, LF, CRLF, FF cannot be agreed, I agree additional
Unicode characters look like a good solution. And again, the sending and
receiving systems should handle conversions.

I don't think tabs are needed. Spaces are sufficient.

I have to say it surprises me. I wasn't trying to flame Frank, and we
haven't had anyone take exception to the tone of the discussion in the
several years I've been here. We do tell each other quite plainly when an
opinion seems ill-founded, as in Michael's comments on my notion of
encoding IPA extensions using XML.

Subject: Frank & Ed

Evidently my diagnosis, that Frank da Cruz had insufficient experience in a
cross-platform environment, was completely wrong, so I apologize for
writing it.

It puzzles me even more, then, that Frank writes in his Unicode text file
proposal as if Unix practice, or more particularly his own practice
(including practice in file format conversions in cross-platform data
transfers), is normative, not just for other software, but for file formats
on other platforms, without saying how this norm is to be implemented so
that file format conversion ceases to be a problem for all applications.

Also:

How do we get agreement on such a standard from, e.g., Microsoft?

How do we get users to stop using current methods?

How do we deal with delimited database transfer files with a fixed limit on
line length?

How do we deal with legacy data?

I find myself dealing with Unicode text created by Windows and Windows
applications quite frequently now, with line ends marked in little-endian
fashion as

0D 00 0A 00

What do we do about that?

I entirely agree that cross-platform protocols should be defined so that we
stop having conversion problems (such as translating text file formats upon
transfer, as ftp does), but it can't be done within a character set
standard, nor by defining a text file format without file format handling
for applications on different platforms.

I have had to collect or in some cases write conversion routines for text
file transfer, including text files in ASCII, 8-bit character sets, and
Unicode. I would much rather have the operating systems do it. If someone
can explain to me how Frank's proposal will lead to that desired goal
better than Frank's proposal with my suggested amendments, I'll be happy to
go along. So can we discuss the issues now?

This is the key point for me. You acknowledge the need for flavors of text
other than your preformatted plain text. I thought you were holding out for
one flavor only. Now we can discuss the flavors, such as delimited database
interchange files with lines of arbitrary length. Presumably we can define
them using some of the apparatus that is becoming available in XML or as
MIME data types. Would it make sense, then, to create a formal XML
definition of plain text files, with a leading BOM, no interpretations for
any tags, the minimum set of control characters, and the appropriate set of
transformation formats? That would get around my earlier objection, about
how to make an implementation available on all platforms. What about
corresponding MIME types?

Hear, hear.

>- Frank

To summarize your answer to my objections, we are defining a new format
independent of previous conventions, in which we can specify usage of the
minimal set of formatting characters regardless of usage in text files of
7-bit ASCII and 8-bit character sets of any kind, while allowing for a few
variant flavors of text, such as preformatted, reflowable, and database. To
which I add, that we can specify a portable implementation, too, and not
have to wait for computer and OS vendors to get on board.

Well, apparently there are no hard feelings from Frank over my earlier
harsh words, so perhaps nobody else need be offended on his behalf. In case
anybody missed it elsewhere, I apologize for misunderstanding Frank, and
for giving the impression that I was attacking him personally.

I find myself in agreement with Ken W's comments a few messages back. I'm also
inclined to say that you are wanting to define (in effect) a MIME type, and that
part of the confusion / disagreement that has arisen in this thread comes about
by calling this type "plain text".

You want a file that is tagged with null markup to be interpreted in a specific
way (as a text document as opposed, e.g. to a database) and with specific layout
formatting. As was pointed out in an earlier message, and as we are all familiar
with, sometime files that contain only text characters and no tagging are used
for purposes other than this, such as the CSV database. Also, there are times
when I've had such text files in which I intend all of the text that exists
between instances of { BOF, EOF, NLF } to appear on a single line, regardless of
length (e.g. in source code), and other times when I expect it to wrap to
whatever width is appropriate for the window in which it is viewed.

All of these are legitimate things to want to be able to do with a file in this
format that we have always known as "plain text". Neither the intended meaning
of the content, nor the intended appearance have ever been part of the
definition of plain text. Thus, I think you should expect some objection to any
suggestion that "plain text" should refer to a file that is intended to be
interpreted in a specific way, i.e. as a text document with specific layout
formatting. Plain text can be neither more nor less than what is has always
been. As we apply plain text to the Unicode context, Ken's comments were on the
mark.

That is not to say that it isn't reasonable, or desireable, to specify a file
format to be used for text documents with specific layout formatting such that
it will always appear as the author intended, and such that no markup is used
beyond a standard interpretation of the characters (separating this file format
from others such as PDF). We'd all benefit from it, if an agreement can be made.
I just think that we may need to call it something else. And this is what Frank

I'll try to be more explicit.

Whether we know it or not, text interchange methods are well-established in
the pre-Unicode world, at least at the record-format level (character sets
are another matter, but we know that).

When I sit at my { terminal, terminal emulator, xterm window } and tell the
host to "type" or "cat" a file, the internal text format is translated to
the de facto canonical one, primarily that the local convention for line
separation/termination is translated to CRLF.  When I transfer a text file
with FTP or any other file transfer protocol I know about, the same thing
happens (see, e.g. RFC959).

However, many of us are confused by the fact that local conventions differ,
and perceive this as an obstacle to interchange because, for example, it is
difficult to read a PC diskette on a UNIX workstation or a Macintosh, or
because of the increasing amounts of email we get that uses some encoding or
format we don't understand.

These are problems that we have an opportunity to solve in the conversion of
8-bit text to Unicode.

We don't have to.  If the Unicode Standard defines what plain text is,
then conversion of 8-bit text to Unicode will put all the divergent
platform-specific formats into the same Unicode format.

How do convert existing 7-bit and 8-bit plain-text files to Unicode plain
text?  The straightforward conversion is:

 . Source line -> Destination line terminated by LS.

This is according to whatever the local definition of "line" is (UNIX,
Macintosh, DOS, VMS, MVS, ...).  And of course:

 . Source character set converted to Unicode.

This seems obvious.  C0 control characters are kept, including Horizontal
Tab and Form Feed.  C1 control characters are kept if the source character
set has them (e.g. a Latin Alphabet) and translated otherwise (e.g. CP850).

Additional wrinkles (options) might include:

 . Tabs expanded to spaces based on the desired tab stops, which should 
   be 1,9,17,35,... BY DEFAULT (meaning you can supply your own tab stops).

 . Heuristics might be used to identify paragraphs and to separate them
   by Paragraph Separator.  For example, a blank line is replaced by PS.
   Obviously there are pitfalls.

 . Any conversion program would probably need an option to deal with
   files with "word processor" record format, in which a line is really
   a paragraph.

I would say that this practice should be discouraged ("be conservative in
what you 'send'") in any application that creates or saves Unicode text
files.  But it should be allowed for ("be liberal in what you 'receive'") in
any conversion/import program.

I don't think anybody can presume to offer a panacea for differing
application formats, other than to define a text-file format that can be
used for export/import/interchange, as we have now with most popular
applications.  We simply need to extend this idea to Unicode.

The operating system doesn't know what format or encoding is used in a
file.  It would be nice if this information was saved along with the file,
but it usually isn't.  If, in the transition to an all-Unicode computing
environment, we specify not only the encoding but also a standard record
format for interchange of plain text -- including (but not requiring)
preformatted plain text -- we won't have to worry about operating systems,
file systems, or presentation-layer issues in text-file transfer ever
again.

Obviously we will always have to worry about format conversions between
applications that do NOT use plain text data files.  But by defining a
low-level baseline format for plain text, there will always be a method for
recording and transmitting textual information that rises above ("sinks
below") those differences, and that can always be used across platforms,
distance, and time.

No, thase are higher-level protocols that will go out of fashion some day,
probably sooner than you think.  Of course you can define or use all the
higher level protocols you want, but you should bear in mind they are
ephemeral.  If you want something that lasts forever, do it in Unicode
without reference to MIME, *ML, or anything else, and keep it extremely 
simple.

All of that is fine.  I'm only proposing that we codify existing practice.
If Unicode has a Line Separator (and it does), then if I put it in a file,
it should serve its purpose.  Ditto for Paragraph Separator.  Ditto for
C0 HT and FF (even though those purposes might be ill-defined), in the
absence of "native" Unicode replacements for them.

I agree that marking a "plain-text" stream as "preformatted" or "to be
flowed" is a higher-level issue.  However, we must also agree that plain text 
CAN be preformatted and not ALWAYS flowed, and that Unicode already contains
the mechanisms to do it.

Yes, "fractured plain text" comes from a flawed conversion algorithm, e.g.
when pasting from a web page into an email window (a "double-ended break"
in this case: misinterpretation of the left margin as leading spaces by the
copier and gratuitous word wrapping by the paster).  Obviously that's an
application issue.  However, I do believe that if we can establish a
baseline for preformatted plain text, makers of such applications will have
a better idea of how to interchange text.

   My thoughts on this indicate that explicit tab widths are not 
appropriate: the only real requirement for plain text is that the 
columns line up. So we could have a character

      COLUMN SEPARATOR

(CSEP) to go with LINE SEPARATOR (LSEP) and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR (PSEP). 
It should interact with these as follows.

   "Within a paragraph that contains a CSEP, each LSEP-delimited 
line represents a row of a table. The table has as many columns as the 
maximum number of CSEP characters in any line. Each column should be 
wide enough to accommodate the longest column-contents in any line in 
that column. No inter-column spacing is provided: if there is to be 
space between columns, one column or the other must contain explicit 
space chatacters."

   So the general form of a table would be

      PSEP ... CSEP ... CSEP ... LSEP
      ...      CSEP ... LSEP
      ...      CSEP ... CSEP ...
      PSEP

   An unsophisticated renderer may choose to render CSEP as a tab to 
an 8-column tab stop, and this may often give acceptable results.

 | Whatever is chosen, let's keep it simple.

   This is simple to define, but not to render. Also, it doesn't give 
control over left/right/centre justifying each column. If this is 
important, I suppose the solution would be a SPACE FILL character, like 
\hfil in TeX, which (when occuring in a table, i e, a paragraph with 
at least one CSEP character) provides enough space to pad the entry it 
appears in to the full width available. This would allow a column to be 
right-justified (start all entries with SPACE FILL), centre-justified 
(put a SPACE FILL character before and after the entries), or even 
justified on a particular character, e g, the decimal point FULL STOP 
(break it into 2 columns, by writing CSEP, FULL STOP instead of FULL 
STOP, and right-justify the first, left-justify the second).

To clarify: I think "line break" could follow the conventions
currently in use on the Internet: Accept all of the three above forms,
but only generate one form, preferably the CR LF sequence.

It seems like the Internet is going to standardize on UTF-8,
and as UTF-8 encodes C0 as a single octet, I think there would be
much sense in chosing a C0 sequence for the "line break" function.

I think the paragraph break could then be chosen as one of
the C0 Information separators, possibly the Record Separator
aka control-^ .

I think the problem with this idea is that if we look at a Unicode
text file and see CR and/or LF in it, we don't know if those
characters came from the private text format of a 7- or 8-bit file
that was converted to Unicode without any record-format conversion,
or if they are the "Unicode" CR and LF.  Therefore this would only
move the problem of incompatible record formats from the old world
(of DOS, Windows, UNIX, Macintosh) to the new one.

It's better to have Unicode characters LS and PS (and I think also
Tab/Column-Separator and Page Separator) than to recycle the C0
controls.  This ensures round-trip integrity without having to know
the history of the data ("it came originally from DOS so to convert
it from Unicode to UNIX we need to...")

I am no more sure about the HT used as a line-break in plain text.
It is indeed used in an internal Word-format (Word 2.0 for DOS, and
perhaps in later versions) for this purpose, but I haven't kept an
old Word implementation, so I cannot check Word's input conversion
from plain text to this format.

Current Word for Windows input conversions from plain text
interpret some C0 characters thus (checked with Word 97):
  '09'x   (TAB)       tabulator
  '0A'x   (LF)        paragraph break
  '0B'x   (VT)        line break
  '0C'x   (FF)        page break
  '0D'x   (CR)        ignored
  '0E'x   (SO) [sic!] column break

Still, my main point holds: In MS-DOS, plain text is not well defined,
as there are wide variations in the usage and meaning of several controll
characters.

I think I can partially answer this from experience on our (non-MS)
environment. Our system continues to use our native line-ending type (LF
only) when dealing with Unicode data, for compatibility. In particular, when
converted to UTF-8, which is how Unicode is normally passed around our OS,
the data will have standard looking line endings - if PS or LS were used,
many non-UTF-8 aware parts of the system would get confused.

Also, a lot of Unicode data is converted from non-Unicode sources -
conversion will almost always leave C0 and C1 characters untouched. Changing
to PS and LS would need knowledge of the source data's line ending
conventions, which is hard to determine automatically. If you also need
round-trip conversion (eg Shift-JIS data in an HTML form -> Unicode browser
workings -> Shift-JIS submission to server), messing with line endings is
almost out of the question.

All other encodings use C0 controls for line endings - it's hard to
make a change for one particular encoding that does it differently.

Indeed, but "preformatted plain text" has traditionally been called
"plain text", or in MIME "text/plain", and this terminology ought not
to be revised unwarrantedly.  Other species of plain text should have
a distinguishing adjective.

We can, but I think we would do well to nail down preformatted
plain text (aka "plain text") first, as it is the most
stable.

No, at least for the XML part.  (You could create a full-SGML
definition, but I question the purpose of it, except perhaps
to help in defining a Unicode-preformatted-plain-text grove model.)

XML compels special interpretations for "<" and "&"
and requires matching enclosing tags; preformatted plain text
has no such requirements.

The corresponding MIME type is "text/plain; charset=utf-8" or
"... utf-16".

Anything else should have a different MIME type or at least
different parameters.

There is a widespread presumption for preformatted, although
sometimes the formatting is done by the creating software, not the user,
alas.  Rendering software usually has at least an option to
display as-is.

And of these, preformatted is the most important and stable, and
should be specified first.  The others can be specified ad libitum
later.

Technically, "MIME types" are called "media types", and what they
really are is named interchange formats.  You *are* trying to develop an
interchange format; making it a media type requires only finding a name
and filling out a short registration form.

As I said in an earlier message, MIME rules provide a strong case
for distinguishing between "text/plain" and "application/character-stream",
(where "application" here really means "other" i.e. "catchall".)
The former must be composed of lines with a maximum length of
(IIRC) 998 characters; the latter has no such restrictions.

Text/plain could still include both reflowable and preformatted
text, but I believe the weight of history is in favor of using that
term for preformatted text only.

Or some other widely accepted source of standardization, such as
Oasis or ECMA or ISO or even W3C (though the first three, IMHO,
have a better "fit" to the subject matter).

I take this to mean "Characters 0x80 to 0x9F are zero-bit-extended
if the source character set has C1 characters; if it does not
(like CP850, CP1252, or VISCII), they are translated to their
proper Unicode graphic equivalents."

Indeed.  For example, blank lines in source code, e.g., are not
necessarily paragraph marks.  This might be a reasonable QOI
issue.

Note that arbitrary-length lines do not meet the MIME definition
of "text" (and nor does UTF-16 text); such things should really
have a media type of "application/character-stream" or the like,
analogous to "application/octet-stream" but with a charset
parameter.

Does this Windows-Unicode text always have a proper little-endian BOM,
as I believe it does?

If so, then the only problem is the precise value of line
terminator.  In practice, much of the Unicode text (perhaps
all of it) in the world today uses old line terminators, and
I think they must be explicitly allowed in a flexible definition of
preformatted Unicode plain text, even if tagged with SHOULD NOT.

SGML is almost as old, as computer things go, as plain text.  Though it
was not standardized until 1986, it was devised in 1974; ASCII itself
only dates to 1963 or so.

Moreover, unlike most file formats, SGML is character-based,
not octet-based, and does not depend on any specific processing
application, so whatever process refreshes Unicode data will
refresh SGML data too.  (XML is merely a special case of SGML.)
I agree that preformatted plain text should not depend on SGML,
though; that is putting Cart before Horse.

My suggestions:

1) The NEL character in the C1 set (0x85) is the ISO equivalent of
EBCDIC NL (0x15) and this mapping is duly given in the EBCDIC code page
mappings on the Unicode FTP site.  The text should therefore advise
applications to treat U+0085 (NL/NEL) as a newline, not U+0015 (NAK).

2) There should be a warning that some old documents use bare
CR (0x0D) to do underlining or other overstriking; an application
that converts such text should do a more complex conversion, though
treating bare CR as a NLF is marginally acceptable even for these
documents (which may then wind up containing occasional lines
with only spaces and underscores).

The semantics of CR and LF in Unicode 2.x *are* the ambiguous
ones inherited from the 7-bit controls; there are no other semantics.
But this has been changed in Unicode 3.0: see UTR #13
(http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr13/), which will be a
normative part of Unicode 3.0.  Note well that UTR #13 does not
solely prescribe the semantics of CR and LF during conversion to and
from Unicode, but also the semantics of CR and LF *in* Unicode.

XML, a major Unicode application, takes almost the same point of view.
(IMHO, XML should be modified to accept LS as a line-end character.)

Indeed.  But the only real problem there is that some people and
applications (notably nroff output) use bare CR in plain text
to produce physical or notional overprinting.  Otherwise, it
is perfectly fine to take the UTR #13 viewpoint.

As for HT and FF, nobody uses them incompatibly, and
introducing new characters for them is supererogation at best.

The Internet and MIME will evolve but I don't see them vanish any
earlier than Unicode.  MIME has been integrated into the majority of
platforms, browsers and mailreaders worldwide.  Without MIME we
wouldn't be able to properly send multilingual text anywhere.

Actually the question of HT and FF is the most bothersome one, for 
me.  There are (at least) two problems:

HT and FF both depend in some sense on the user's environment, e.g. 
page length (paper size if the "rendering engine" is a printer or 
hardcopy terminal), and tab stop settings.

HT has ambiguous semantics when the HT occurs when the cursor is 
already at a tab stop.  If the cursor got to a tab stop because of an 
HT, then there is no argument - another HT moves to the next tab 
stop.  But if the cursor got there because of ordinary, implicit 
movement, then some systems ignore an HT (i.e. stay in the same 
place), while others move on to the next stop.  Granted, this is 
mainly a problem of input methods rather than data storage or 
interchange, but I don't think it's quite fair to say that no one 
uses HT incompatibly.

Whoa! Wait a minute. How do we get from here to there?

If it's tagged, it's not a *plain* text file, but something else.

The way ahead out of the character set identity morass for "text files"
is to use the Universal Character Set -- that way, once again, we
will know how to interpret plain text files.

The rest of this discussion is about something else other than what
the Unicode Standard means by "plain text", and has, as far as I can
tell, more to do with devising a kind of a lowest common denominator
document format standard for interoperability. While people on this list
may find that interesting to discuss, it is rather orthogonal to the
intended scope of the Unicode Standard.

The unfortunate horse is already out of the burning barn on this one.

This isn't going to happen. Column alignment in tables is clearly a
higher-level document formatting issue -- not a problem to be solved
by attributing complex layout attributes to yet another format control
character in the character encoding standard.

No, a table is an object defined at a higher level.

Frank got that one right. We already got TAB's, ineluctably. So define
some interoperable behavior on them, as is already done for the kind
of preformatted plain text Frank is talking about. Otherwise, use
spaces. Any other attempts to push more complex formatting down to the
bare minimum preformatted plain text format is bound to fail, IMO.

This is not the case. UTR #13 *is* to be considered part of the Unicode
Standard, Version 3.0:

http://www.unicode.org/unicode/standard/versions/Unicode3.0-beta.html

However, UTR #13 constitutes "Unicode Newline *Guidelines*" [emphasis
added]. There is no conformance specification and there are no
normative implications. The scope constitutes: "a set of
recommendations for handling these characters so as to minimize the
effects on users." Think of UTR #13 as a late addition to Chapter 5,
Implementation Guidelines, that did not make it into the actual printed
text of The Unicode Standard, Version 3.0, forthcoming.

It makes suggestions. It does not normatively prescribe.

I would agree with this.

This was a typo/oversight in the text of UTR #13 and will be corrected.

This is a good suggestion to add to the text of UTR #13.

Sorry, I meant externally tagged, e.g. in the directory entry, along
with the size, date, etc.  (The lack of this kind of external tagging
is a pet peeve of long duration, but is not exactly relevant to this
discussion.)

Agreed!  Well...  At least if we are successful, and some new consortium
doesn't come along xx years from now and declare Unicode to be "legacy"
and its own new-and-improved universal encoding to be the only one to
use from now on.  At which point, we might need to differentiate
"legacy" Unicode data from the new code, just as we now need to
distinguish Unicode from Macintosh Quickdraw, Latin-1, etc.  (Saying
there will be only one character set in the future is like saying a
network address can be 8 bits because there will never be more than 256
computers on a network :-)

If it is, it shouldn't be.  If we rely on some other organization to
worry about this (which one has the authority?) and Unicode outlives
the standards and products of that organization, then we're back to "all
bets are off".

On the other hand, if we can back up the statement that Unicode is a
plain-text standard with a definition of plain text that incorporates
"lowest common denominator document format standard for interoperability"
I think we will have added significant value and endurance to Unicode.

The discussion seems to be trailing off -- I suppose I'll wait a few
days to see what else comes up and then attempt to write something up
(with full consideration of TR13).

Ah, I missed that point.  But my point was that whereas Unicode 2.0
had nothing to say about CR and LF and N(E)L, Unicode 3.0 does.

I believe the reference was to file metadata like the application

Just so.  Historically, such document have been called "plain text"
documents.  What Unicode means by "plain text" is simply a
stream of characters.

Subject: Re: Plain text: Tab stops
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

HT has even more ambiguous semantics than you indicate. We did a survey a
few years ago of word processors and desktop publishing programs, and
found a wide range of different behaviors. Suppose you have a set of tab
stops, e.g. at 12pt, 36pt, 72pt, etc. You also have a string of text
containing tabs. The tabs in the text divide up the text into a list of
tab fields (the text between tabs). There are four problematic
situations.

1. A tab field would touch or overlap a previous tab field if placed at
the tab stop.* Possible behaviors we observed here were:
- go to the next tab stop
- go to the next line, at that tab stop.
- go to the next line, at the start
- ignore the tab, treat it as a space, and merge with the next tab field.

2. There are more tab fields than tab stops. Possible behaviors we
observed here were:
- go to the next line, at that tab stop.
- go to the next line, at the start
- ignore the tab, treat it as a space, and merge with the next tab field.

- manufacture implicit tab stops past the end, e.g. at every 36 points,
or at every 8 em.

3. A tab field would exceed the paragraph margin. Possible behaviors we
observed here were:
- go to the next line, at the start
- go to the next line, at the first tab stop.

4. Tabs are used in non-left flush lines (e.g. with centered or
right-flush lines). Possible behaviors we observed here were:
- ignore the flush setting on the line.
- apply the flush to just the first tab field.
- apply the flush to just the last tab field.
- lay out the tab fields as if the text were left-flush, then shift the
entire line to center or right-flush it. (This comes up with pretty
random looking tabulation.)

Some DTP programs, despite our best efforts to figure out the rules they
were using, appeared to be pretty random in their behavior. This is
especially the case with #4.

* Overlap (#1) does not only mean that the tab field is too big for the
tab stop; it also happens with mixtures of left, right and center tabs.
Look at the following example, where '[' means left tab stop, and '|'
means centered tab stop, and '~' means tab (and use monospaced font to
see properly):
[             |
aaaaaaaaaaaa~bbbbbbb
The bbbbbbb text can't be placed at the centered tab stop properly
without overlapping the aaaaaaaaaaaa. Overlap can also happen when the
second tab field is centered or right flush and is so large that it
overlaps with the left margin.

   Couldn't the same once have been said of "advance to next line"? 
Originally derived from 2 hardware control commands, but now made 
abstract as LSEP? 

   There various ways to express the semantic "advance to next column" 
in plain text, chiefly:

         ---insert enough spaces to make the lines line up;

         ---insert an HT character;

         ---insert a number of HT characters.

   The descriptions for LSEP and PSEP say "may be used to express this 
semantic unambiguously". Confronted by a requirement that the concept 
of vertically-aligned columns might be an important part of plain text, 
the consistent option seems to be a character whose only purpose is to 
separate columns. This has 2 almost-immediate corollaries: (1) LSEP 
should separate rows; (2) the scope of the columns should be limited in 
some way, with PSEP being the obvious choice.

   As I noted, it has exactly the same minimum implementation 
requirements as HT, but it also gives the renderer the *option* of 
doing nicer alignment, if it wants. So it needn't be complex.

   It is certainly possible that the foundation on which this rests 
("the concept of vertically-aligned columns is an important part of 
plain text") is just not true---in which case trying to nail down the 
semantics of HT seems like a logically impossible task, as it shares 
that foundation.

Doesn't this assume fixed, or at least known width, glyphs? 
And do you take into account non spacing glyphs?

What about scripts that can be written vertically or horizontally?

Scripts where the glyph form representing a character(and thus its width)
is dependant on context? 

Making columns line up by inserting spaces is not a good idea.

How is "text/plain" defined? What does it specify about line lengths, word
wrap, fixed vs. proportional fonts, line end characters, and line and

  Can I propose that everyone on this mailing list stop sending messages
in "pre-Unicode" encodings(like ISO-8859-1) and begin sending her/his
messages with non-US-ASCII characters in UTF-8(well, US-ASCII only
message also qualifies for UTF-8 as everybody knows)? Isn't it funny
that people on the Unicode mailing list send messages in "legacy"
encodings like ISO-8859-1(by far the most frequently used encoding in
the list which is not UTF-8 other than US-ASCII which can be labelled as
UTF-8)? I know this will for sure lead to some inconveniences for some
people(perhaps quite many of us), but aren't we suppose to be an exampla
case in promoting as rapid and wide adoption of Unicode as possible?

RFC 2046, section 4.1 ff., is authoritative:

# Plain text does not provide for or allow
# formatting commands, font attribute specifications, processing
# instructions, interpretation directives, or content markup.  Plain
# text is seen simply as a linear sequence of characters, possibly
# interrupted by line breaks or page breaks.  Plain text may allow the
# stacking of several characters in the same position in the text.
# Plain text in scripts like Arabic and Hebrew may also include
# facilities that allow the arbitrary mixing of text segments with
# opposite writing directions.
#
# [...]
# 
# The canonical form of any MIME "text" subtype MUST always represent a
# line break as a CRLF sequence.  Similarly, any occurrence of CRLF in
# MIME "text" MUST represent a line break.  Use of CR and LF outside of
# line break sequences is also forbidden.
#
# This rule applies regardless of format or character set or sets
# involved.
#
# NOTE: The proper interpretation of line breaks when a body is
# displayed depends on the media type. In particular, [...] it is
# appropriate to treat a line break as a transition to a new line when
# displaying a "text/plain" body [...]. It should not be
#  necessary to add any line breaks to display "text/plain" correctly
# [...].

There is no talk of fonts or paragraphs, and the "NOTE:" paragraph
suggests that word (or non-word) wrapping is inappropriate.

It's not that I scorn legacy software; that would be like scorning gravity
(or God, where a certain software maker is concerned).  I just think the
natual language, and not legacy software ("encoding designs" would be a
better term here) should be the yardstick.

Yes; I should have said "unfinished" or the like instead of loose; I don't

One request: please let's not resort to such labels.  "Ism-ism" in my
opinion almost always obscures more than it enlightens.  As to the specifics
of your comment, I am emphatically not making the case that Arabic has some
sort of mystical essence that deserves some kind of special treatment.  On
the contrary my point is precisely that it and many other languages that do
not share the linguistic features that make e.g. English amenable to digital
representations already receive a kind of special treatment, in that they
must be encoded using a strategy designed for one class of languages.  I
think this situation could be remedied to a certain extent without breaking
unicode.

But this begs the question.  They don't encounter particular morphologies;
they encounter particular encodings.  Encodings, natural and artificial,
always reflect some theory of language.  Change the encoding and you change
the problem.

On the contrary, you cannot *not* build morphological structure into an
encoding.  Unicode already does: lexemes are built by concatenating text
atoms.  Works great for English, not so great for e.g. Arabic.  How else can
one explain the space "character" as a positive element?  Even for Arabic
Unicode accomodates some level of morphological intelligence: "contextual
shaping" encodes morphology (prosodic word boundary).  Every "natural"
encoding of language into visual form does the same to some extent.  It's
not a question of whether, but of how much.

Understood, but my view is that this is where Unicode itself gets a little
confused.  Does it or does it not encode presentational (visual) form?
Arabic presentational forms (by which I mean all letterforms used in
writing) are indeed used in many languages from different families, but do
these presentational forms share the same character semantics across
languages?  I sincerely doubt it.  So an encoding that works across
languages must sharply distinguish between character semantics and
presentational form.  Which gets us back to grammatical encoding.  BTW, in
one of your earlier notes you pointed out that handwriting sequence is the
preferable guide to implementing input methods.  This is the alternative:
grammatical sequence.

I'll put together some examples of what I mean this weekend.

Not to be provocative, but isn't it interesting how "plain text" just seems
to work for some languages and not for others?

I don't want you to misconstrue my remarks as a mere whine about the woeful
state of the world; I've actually got some concrete suggestions that I'll
post this weekend along with some more background info.  I think they're
technically feasable, which probably dooms them ;.)

Thanks again,

I personally am not convinced that higher layer protocols should be used
to handle punctuation. This completely violates by concept of plain
text, and the existing practice of using higher layer protocols here
clearly just derives from the limitations of ASCII, an artifact of an
era that we are hopefully about to leave behind us. Higher layer
protocols such as SGML are fine for things like font selection and other
formatting and logical structuring, but quotation marks and other
punctuation are too much part of the raw text than that I would like to
see them handled via hacks such as <Q>. Higher layer protocols should in
my opinion not represent the actual textual content of the text, but
give only auxiliary structuring and representation hints. Therefore I
don't like to see markup for quotation marks, just as I don't like the
idea to have to markup conditional clauses, sentences, and perhaps even
paragraphs (not sure about the last one though).

> 2. The situation for Hyphen-Minus is quite similar. 

Agreed, it is equally confusing and keyboard entry conventions should be
carefully standardized here as well.

Excellent! I missed that 2.1 correction, and I am delighted to see that
this was already fixed nicely. So U+02BC is one thing less to worry
about and the Microsoft Word practice actually does conform to the
standard. Thanks for the reply.

So the rest is really up to the keyboard standards community to fix.

Ada95 is even younger than Java and it is the first ISO standardized
programming language that was designed after the publication of ISO
10646-1. Of course, Ada95 - like Java - also uses UCS as its internal
character set. However, the Ada95 revision team has explicitly decided
not to follow the path of Java and they only allowed the Latin-1 letters
in identifiers. The Ada community is very concerned about safety issues
and about the readability of source code, because Ada is widely deployed
today in safety critical environments (most avionics software is written
in Ada for instance). Unicode contains a quite large number of
characters that are difficult - if not impossible - to distinguish
visually. A safety requirement for Ada identifiers is that it must be
easy for human readers to decide whether two identifiers are different
or equal. The presence of Unicode characters such as U+00D0, U+0110 and
U+0189 introduces a lot of potential hazards that are best avoided by
not allowing a too rich repertoires of characters in object identifiers.
Note however that the Ada95 standard does allow implementations to offer
"non-standard" optional modes that do allow additional UCS characters in
identifiers.

Have a look at:

  Ada95 Reference Manual, ISO/IEC 8652:1995(E), Section 2.1: Character Set,
  http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/languages/ada/userdocs/docadalt/rm95/02.htm

  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/ada.html

(who decided to use Ada95 for his PhD implementation project, because
the language is at least as nice and modern as Java, but its compilers
produce far more efficient native machine code.)

Subject: RE: The future of UTF-8



The issue I have with BOM's is that if I have 2 "plain text"
files and I do this kind of operation:

type appendfile >> oldfile

It's not guarenteed to work unless the consuming application
processes multiple BOMS which in that case it renders utf-16
and ucs4 fully stateful from a consumer application's p.o.v. 
albeit with only two states since it needs to filter all incoming
characters.  The above operation works with all other "plain text" files
including utf-8 without any "stateful" transitions.

This kind of operation is really not uncommon.  Take log files.
If I have two co-operating applications of different endianness 
machines writing to the same log where one machine is big endian 
and one little endian, then the application needs to care about
endianness when it's writing utf-16 but not so with utf-8.

I can probably come up with some more examples.

When utf-16 became born, there was no real reason to go with it
because at that point, you have all the problems with multibyte
encodings and most of the programming community still like using
8 bit chars, we still fight this inside MS with libs ported to CE.
As you can tell, these are my opinions and not necessarily that of my
employer.

Anyhow, the other issue is that many applications that process
wide chars are not utf-16 aware, while any internationalized 8 bit
application that multibyte aware is a whole lot easier to port
to Unicode using utf-8.  Where time is money, it's virtually 
impossible to justify spending the sort of time that's required to
go to utf-16 when utf-8 can be just as effective.

It's also relativly easy to write a string class that has both
a utf-16 and utf-8 "view" of a string making it virtually unnessasary
to do an either-or decision so you get to pick the best of both
worlds.

So, apologies for my earlier snappy comments, it wasn't intended
that way, although the MS stock price may have had somthing to do 
with it :))

As always, highest Regards
G

Gianni,

> If you need to process BOM's (10646 signatures) it is then stateful.

How so?

The Unicode character encoding itself is not stateful.

The UTF-16 encoding form is not stateful.

The UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE UTF's (serializations) are not stateful.

UTF-16 as a UTF (serialization) is ambiguous as to the byte order
of the serialization. That ambiguity is resolved in one of several
ways:
   1. A higher order protocol. At which point, the data processing
          is not stateful.
   2. By detection of a BOM. When the BOM is detected and interpreted,
          the data processing of the textual content is not stateful.
   3. By heuristics. And while the heuristic processing itself might
          be stateful, once the outcome of the heuristic provides
          an answer for the byte order, subsequent processing is
          not stateful. And this is in effect no different that any
          heuristic applied to detect character set, whether that
          character set itself is a stateful encoding or not.

The term "stateful", as applied to character encodings, usually
is referring to architectures like ISO 2022, where the state
induced by an escape sequence must be retained to interpret all
subsequent bytes, until encountering another escape sequences changes
the state, and thus the interpretation of the next run of bytes.
That is quite different from determination of the byte polarity "state"
on a data type before processing it. If that were the case, then you
could equally well claim that processing of any integral datatype
larger than a byte is "stateful" in a cross-platform environment.
But that is diluting the term "stateful" in the character encoding
context down to the point where it has nothing in common with
its intended applicability.

The reason this is not guaranteed to work is because the command processor
that's doing "type" with redirection doesn't know about the file formats.
It's the command processor that's defective, NOT the use of BOM/file
signature. 

It is a trivial matter to write a process that correctly concatenates files
with BOMs. I'm sure that someone on this list can promptly cough up a few
lines of perl that does it.

Your argument is not much different than expecting to be able to do a
byte-wise concatenation of a Shift+JIS file with a codepage 1252 (Windows
Western) file. These are both "plain text" files, but it fails miserably.

I think that transparent byte-wise concatenation of files is a minor
consideration when designing the file format.

And if oldfile happens to be a sequential access file, a tape for
example, the command processor rewinds to the beginning of the
file, reads the BOM if it exists, seeks back to the end of the
file, then somehow arranges to signal to the application the
format that it should write its standard output should be? Even
if you can avoid changing the individual applications by sticking
a byte-flipper downstream of the "write" system call, determining
the file format via a BOM is not always going to be a reasonable
thing to do.

I did the conversion of the Adobe fonts to ISO 10646-1 based on the
Adobe glyph names found in the fonts (because this catches also
unencoded glyphs that are hidden in many of the X11 BDF files but
unavailable under any ISO 8859-1 code), based on the following Adobe
table, which maps Postscript glyph names to UCS:

  http://partners.adobe.com/supportservice/devrelations/typeforum/glyphlist.txt

I dropped all characters from the font which are neither in the above
list nor have already a uniXXXX name. This includes the above bracket
fragment characters, for which there exists no Unicode equivalent.

By the way, the bracket fragments were in Frank da Cruz's terminal
symbol proposal, for which I completely forgot to scan and publish a
number of exhibits that Frank has sent me as a basis for further
discussion. Will be on the web next week. Sorry for the delay.

I could probably put the Adobe Symbol bracket fragments into the private
use section, as suggested by the Adobe mapping tables found on the
Unicode ftp server. However, I do not like these particular characters
anyway. I believe that variable size parentheses, braces and brackets
should really be drawn using graphics primitives (spline and line
terminates areas) from a simple algorithmic description in the style
sheet language. Putting them together from font pieces is highly
non-portable and also does not give you the same quality that an
algorithmic specification could provide. If you really want to have
these bracket parts for MathML, I do urge you to reconsider this entire
approach of relying on the font here. The use of special math building
blocks in TeX was *THE* primary reason of why TeX is hardly ever used
with any other fonts than Knuth's Computer Modern, because all others
lack the bracket parts is exactly the alignment in which TeX requires
them.

If TeX had used graphics primitives to draw variable sized parentheses
and square roots, we could much more easily use any arbitrary commercial
of the shelf font with TeX in mathematical texts. Please do not repeat
the same mistake again and lock the math layout functionality to a
single specific font. Please take the variable shapes from the style
sheet and not from the font!

As I said, the Adobe Symbol font is *very* small and will lead to more
frustration than satisfaction among MathML users. It is so small that it
is not necessarily better than nothing. Potential MathML users are today
TeX users. They will have the expectation that at least all TeX symbols
are available, so a real ISO 10646-1 font is clearly the way to go
here.

Oh yes, we have at least one Japanese member in the XFree86 team who is
quite vocal about these issues. :) I have started to use the convention
that ADD_STYLE_NAME is set to "ja" in the XLFD of Japanese UCS fonts,
such that we could indeed restrict the set of fonts that we advertise as
being available under a JIS encoding.

Better late than never :-)  I also promised to send a Unicode plain text
proposal, but then real life intruded.  It's not forgotten.

Meanwhile, there might be some hope for the bracket pieces in the
math plain-text work.

Again, the rationale is to be able to construct mathematical expressions
on character-cell devices where we don't have GUI fonts and rendering
engines (primarily when emulating terminals and printers that do this in
applications that are Unicode-based).  In this case we don't have to
worry too much about alignment since these devices are monospaced.

Obviously bracket pieces are not the preferred method for rendering math
in the GUI environment.

I don't think this violates the idea of "plain text". Plain text is an
interchange concept, while we are talking about input methods. Once you
wish to allow plain text to include more than the small number of
characters that can be conveniently provided by the keyboard you have to
provide more sophisticated input methods.

Quotation marks are just one case, Unicode contains many more characters an
author may wish to use that are not in his keyboard. Hexadecimal is not a
solution for the general public.

I suggest we take a look at how things used to be done before computers. In
those ancient times, one would give a printer a manuscript (= hand written
paper), which was marked up either by the author or by an editor, and the
printer would set the text in print. This was the grandfather of mark-up
languages, later standardized in SGML. 

In those manuscripts, the text could not indicate precisely various
typographic distinctions, such as quotation marks, and in those cases
markup was used.

It is much more user friendly to have to write <Q>text</Q>, or to select
the text and click on a "quotation" menu item, indicating intent, rather
than <&lsqm>text<&rsqm> or something similar, or some fancy keyboard
combination, in which the author has to specify the precise implications of
his intent.

How will mathematical symbols be entered in plain text?

Text-Only is the format of most newsgroups.

To make things perfectly clear, MIME and it's friends are not wanted in
newsgroups for the following reasons.  And it has nothing to do with
OpenVMS.  It is for them to be of the most use, and that includes
accommodating those users with "backward" technology.

Posters that violate this Netiquette will either be politely reminded of the
conventions or will be ignored.  This is not a moderated newsgroup/mailing
list, so that is the only means of enforcing the convention.

In the past, most posters have taken the hint from one polite reminder, and
a few needed to learn how to adjust their mail/news sending program.

And as typical in most societies, many people will ignore RUDE behavior,
hoping that the person will realize their gaffe, or that someone else will
explain things.


1. The contents of the newsgroups are automatically collected and archived
for later searches.  In many cases the archiver simply collects the data and
jams it into one file based on a size limit or an age limit.
There are multiple archives, some public ones, and some private ones that
force you to view advertisements.

Most of these were put in place before MIME messages were considered, or any
type of attachment for that matter.  Some of these archivers ignore ALL
attachments, but most of the ones I have seen simply jam the attachment to
the end of the message.

Since it is good Netiquette to search these archives before posting a
question, it becomes a royal pain to open a archive to get the information
the search engine says is in it, and find the pages of hexdumps that
typically follow some filename xxxxxx.VCF in it.

The HTML formatted stuff is also hard to read.  Since it is stuffed between
the normal plain text stuff, even a MIME enabled reader will not translate
it.

And there is another format that puts "=20" at the ends of all the lines
along with some other random stuff.


2.  Many users of Usenet do not have access to a newsreader.  Many times
because this access is blocked at the corporate firewall.  They also do not
want to filter out their important messages from the volume of messages that
a newsgroup can generate.  So they set their mail delivery to DIGEST mode.
In DIGEST mode, all MIME stuff gets delivered as described in point 1.


3.  Many Corporate E-Mail systems still can not handle MIME.  The system
that I use at work just got the capability early this year.  Prior to that,
a MIME message was treated as follows.  First I would receive a message with
a title and a blank body.  Then I would receive a message with no title that
a MIME encoded message had been received.  A bit latter, each attachment
would show up in a separate message with no title.  Other messages can be
randomly interposed between them.


4. After the Melissa adventure, many corporate sites are putting in E-mail
filters that will block bad messages.  The first pass was to stop all
messages with the indicated title.  That of course is not sufficient for
long term.  There are reports in the trade press, that some companies are
returning to sender any HTML formatted document as a precaution.  The
intended receiver may get a notice of the rejection just in case the E-Mail
is important.


5. Given the state that E-Mail is in today, especially in a corporate
environment, it would not look good to send MIME stuff to a person you want
to be in a business relationship with, if you do not absolutely know that
their mail software can handle it.  There are still many users of IBM
OFFICE-VISION getting their mail on 3270 terminals.  This type of behavior
can damage a business relationship.

Especially if the customer is running OUTLOOK and a sales / marketing
critter mails a HTML document that contains a virus.


The bottom line is that it is RUDE of the sender to assume that the
recipient can receive anything but plain text.  The mime stuff is great,
once you have established that the recipient can handle it.

The VCF stuff to verify a sender's identity should be reserved for those
receivers that request it.  The ones that do not request it can not use it,
and it is useless garbage to them.  It is just wasting bandwidth and storage
space on mail and news servers.

-John
By the way, MIME can include PostScript, REGIS, and SIXEL.  My OpenVMS
systems can handle these but I know that most M$soft can not, and most UN*X
can not handle all three.

       (JM) That's a matter of opinion!


       JoAnne, how can you say that this is a matter of opinion? As
       soon as a generation grows up learning to read and write
       English using only CC, the majority Kwill only have access to
       recent documents; documents in the old orthography won't
       spontaneously transform themselves. Humanity has a *very, very,
       very huge* investment in published and unpublished documents in
       English using the existing orthograhy, and there is a
       probability of 0.00 +/- 0% that we want to throw that away, or
       that we want to limit access to that information to a minority
       that chose to learn the old orthography in addition to the new
       CC-based standard. I don't think even you can disagree with
       that. And if we will want to continue to teach our children to
       read the old orthography, why would we ever consider putting
       ourselves through the trauma of replacing bad, old Roman
       script-based English orthography with CC?

       There is a recent case of a language community changing their
       orthography from one script to an unrelated script: Turkish was
       written in Arabic until the early part of this century, and
       since then in Roman. This was possible because:

       - the language community was pretty well limited to one nation,
       - the literacy rate was not that high,
       - the old script was not that well suited for representing the
       phonology of the language,
       - the new script was much better suited to represent the
       phonology of the language,
       - there was not a really large corpus of books existing that
       used the old script, and
       - there was an authoritarian government that was able to impose
       the reform on the entire language community.

       *None* of these are true of English.

       I have now contributed comments that relate to semiotic issues,
       to issues of the psychology and physiology of reading and
       writing, and to sociolinguistic issues of attitude and usage. I
       also threw in various comments on historical linguistic issues
       along the way. So, there shouldn't be any doubt of my opinion
       of introducing CC as a replacement for existing English
       orthography.

       While some of us may want to pursue the idea of writing English
       using CC as one of personal interest, we should not for a
       moment fool ourselves into thinking that CC could possibly
       become the conventional way of writing English, or even a
       conventional way of writing English.

       End of diatribe.

       Peter

As I understand it, Markus was speaking about the interchange formats,
including, but not limited to, file formats and IPC formats.  It is
expected that simple applications will only be able to accept
precomposed forms, while enlightened ones (I like the term) will
accept anything.  Therefore, requesting that applications *write*
precomposed forms in preference to combining characters maximises the
chances of interchange between simple and complex applications.
Complex applications are still expected to accept arbitrary combining
characters; they just should avoid producing them whenever possible.

(The question of unification of compatibility forms -- C vs. KC -- is
a different issue altogether; not one I would dare to claim that I am
even vaguely not totally incompetent to have an opinion on.)

I'd have to ask Why?

Why?  That's about the opposite of what I'd argue.  In my experience most of  
the drudgery and complexity of display processing for Unicode is in dealing  
with the multiple spellings; not with just decomposed or composed sequences.

I guess maybe I should just shut up because my argument is really about  
something different than normalization itself, it's about architectures that  
require applications to care about particular details of data normalization.

What really appears to be going on in the world of Unix is that generally in  
these systems the "legacy" or existing methods of string & character  
handling are being bolstered to deal with this new kind of data for which  
they are an inappropriate level of API.  Instead of architecting them to  
remove the need for application programmers to worry about all this detail,  
the detail is being exported to the programmer in the same way that it was  
when the encodings were "simpler".  I think it's the wrong way to go about  
the architecture.

As I see it, systems that require "all" applications to mess around with the  
low-level details of what is or is not stored as a combining sequence in  
some string that's passing through some process is mis-architected from the  
start.  Only the lowest level of data-streaming and I/O of file formats  
should be dealing with that.

GUI & UI systems that sit on top of Unix foundations appear in general to be  
architected in ways that expose details, like composition/decomposition  
normalization of the data, excruciating details of codesets and data formats,  
that should be of no concern to "applications" written on theose platforms   
Unfortunately, the architects tend to get hung up on how to expose these  
details by  extensive APIs, and argue a lot about details that should be of  
as little concern to "application programs" as assembly language is to Java  
programs.

If one is going to re-write the set of typical Unix foundation-level tools,  
I think there are better ways to write them and different kinds of API that  
are more appropriate for better abstraction away from the minutiae of  
character encodings and normalization.  That would free the application  
programmer from such details, instead of causing the application programmer  
to be acutely concerned with such details.

So when I see something like this:

> One day, combining characters will surely be supported under Linux,
>...
>> More formally, the preferred way of encoding text in Unicode under

>> Technical Report #15

It makes me cringe.  <rant> This is saying that for everything written on  
this entire OS -- all the UI, the tools, protocols, applications, etc. that  
should be the "preferred" way of encoding simply because the display model is  
broken and the architects have been going in the wrong direction for years  
and wish to continue down that path because of the overwhelming weight of  
their legacy code. </rant>

I think it's more appropriate to leave the specification of normalization  
requirements up to particular protocols or functional groups, not "Unicode  
under Linux" as a whole.  In the long run, Linux would be much better off  
going the opposite direction for most string & display handling.  In my  
opinion.

Enough ranting for the day...

I think this is reflective of the overall situation with computing today.
You can only change what you can control.  In a monolithic environment like
Windows or the Macintosh, a single company has control and can do what it
likes, but perhaps more to point, these are closed boxes in which the
application has more or less direct access to the keyboard, screen, fonts,
and font info -- all the pieces of the puzzle.

Contrast this with Unix.  First of all (obviously) there is not just one
Unix, but many of them (the UNIX C-Kermit makefile alone currently contains
about 500 targets).  Nobody controls all this.  Each vendor goes their own
way at their own pace.  The many well-known utilities (command-line or
"video") have long since "forked".  The existing code base is staggering,
and most of it is nondisclosed (Linux, *BSD, etc, are the exception (to
"nondisclosed", if not to "forked")).

Makers of third-party applications for Unix (and VMS, etc), if they want to
move forward, can't (in most cases) depend on the underlying platforms for
assistance.  Even when they can, such assistance is inconsistent, forcing
them to develop their own portable tools and libraries, which tend to meet
their immediate needs but fall short of Nirvana.

Perhaps more to the point, however, is the fact that Unix (and VMS and other
"traditional" platforms) are open to many kinds of access: the workstation
console, usually some sort of GUI (also on the console), X (on the console
or from a remote X server), and then plain old character-mode remote access
via modem, Telnet, Rlogin, X.25 PAD, and the like.  The latter mode, which
is branded "legacy" as if it had no value or place in the modern world, is
(I like to maintain, and I think with good reason) seeing wider use now than
ever before and although many wish it would go away, others would like to
stay active in this area and serve the people who depend on it, not only for
old time's sake, but also because it is a legitimate, viable, and open form
of access that everybody should be able to fall back upon as the the more
advanced and "interesting" forms change out from under them with bewildering
speed.

When access is this open -- which is a *good* thing -- no particular entity
has control over the user interface.  It is a matter of coordinating the
behavior of intrinsically unrelated processes.  So questions come up here
that never bother us when we are writing (say) a word processor.  Which
end handles bidirectionality of Hebrew?  Which end is responsible for the
detailed appearance of the screen?  And now the questions of pre- and de-
composition.

Makers of third party applications only control one piece.  The underlying
platform is likely not to have any Unicode support at all (VMS, most UNIXes,
IBM mainframes, etc), so the extent to which we support Unicode in our
applications depends on the hosts that we access with them.  In the case of
terminal emulation (xterm, Kermit, etc), if the host is not executing any
form of BIDI algorithm, or ensuring some canonical form for composed
characters, etc (since it is totally ignorant of such matters), it does not
necessarily follow that the terminal must compensate, since for applications
where the screen is treated as a matrix of boxes in which the location of
different items must be known and fixed (and this can include dumb scrolling
applications that display text in columns), the host and terminal must
cooperate.

ISO 10646 includes the concepts of levels of compliance, including
Implementation Level 1 in which combining characters are not allowed.
Unicode Normalization Form C tends to amount to the same thing.  If these
"subsets" were not to be used, they shouldn't have been defined.  But in
fact, I believe they are useful in open-access environments where control is
distributed among "loosely cooperating" processes.  Perhaps there is indeed
a tradeoff between open access and the ability to support complex scripts --
if not in theory, then almost certainly in practice.

Of course, we do have one example of Unix taken to the next level: Plan 9.
But even there -- where all text, even internally, is UTF-8 -- we still see
no provision for BIDI or combining sequences: Implementation Level 1 in
action.  Everyone agrees it would be better to have no restrictions, but so
far I don't think anybody has considered the plain-text terminal-host
access model sufficiently to find a way around them.

       contain every Unicode character in high quality. Unicode should
       be more seen as a scheme to encode characters, not as a
       repertoire that from now on every font has to cover entirely.

       I agree that we probably don't want every font to be used for
       IPA. But there still is an issue of encoding ambiguity when
       dealing with plain text. Perhaps the answer, though, is that,
       strictly speaking, plain text is effectively meaningless.
       Knowing the encoding tells you how to get one level of
       semantics, i.e. how to translate the bytes into abstract
       characters, but you still don't know what the sequence of
       characters mean in terms of any human language until the
       language is identified. If you get a plaintext file and it
       contains

       "See Dick run."

       Then you'll make an assumption about the intended language, and
       that assumption will probably be valid. But it's an assumtion
       nontheless. When there is real potential ambiguity, there is no
       recourse but to provide some markup:

       <blahurg>See Dick run.</blahurg>

       (undoubtedly means something derogatory about the listener's
       grandmother). If the plaintext happens to mix text in IPA and
       text a language that uses U+0061, then if there is confusion it
       may be necessary to have markup along the lines of

       <eng>The Blahurg word for ...  pronounced, "<ipa> ...a...
       </ipa>", and means ... upset.</eng>

       Of course, I probably wouldn't complain if there was a separate
       character LATIN IPA SMALL LETTER A that disambiguated this for
       plain text. (Nobody should be confused about the purpose of a
       character with such a name.) Ditto for other cases.


       >For every font style, there are Unicode characters that will

This is true.  The reason Vim doesn't support automatic paragraph formatting
is that there is no "soft" line separator.  I'm glad there is something we can
agree on!

You can work with single-line paragraphs in Vim by setting the 'linebreak'
option.  This might be the mode you are looking for.  See ":help 'linebreak'"
for more information.

One disadvantage is that the width of the wrapped lines depends on the width
of the terminal.  If you view the file on a different terminal it may look
different.  It might be different again when you print it.  That might not
always be what you want.  Wordstar (do you remember that?) had a soft
linebreak character for this (CR with the 8th bit set).  But only Wordstar
supported it, thus it wasn't very useful.  You always had to print the file
from Wordstar.

Just using NL should work fine.  As far as I know LF is just another name for
NL, it's the same character (hex 0x0A).  A paragraph could be ended by an
empty line (in the file that's a double NL).  We could even recommend this.
Perhaps we should add a note about this in appropriate places?

I don't see why that would create any problem. The kernel knows what a  
modifier key is, right? IIRC, it already has a bitmap-type interface via  
IOCTLs.

You could define a key sequence that restores the keyboard to normal mode.  
Something like Alt-SysReq-R ... uh, we already have that one.

> I wonder, is UCS-4 the maximum that is in use today?

More than that.

The UCS-2 range is the maximum in use today. There are no characters yet
defined outside the range U+0000 to U+FFFD, which is known as "Plane 0"
(except the so-called Plane-14 tags, which are not really part of
Unicode). A plane is a 16-bit range with 2**16 code points. However,
there do exist plans to fill Plane 1 with scripts that are of historic,
cultural, hobbyist and scientific interest (Hierglyphics, Tengwar,
Klingon, Blissymbolics, very exotic mathematical symbols, etc.). These
are characters that are not urgently needed (there exists very little
practice in encoding them on computers today if any at all), but it is
nice to have them covered at least in theory as well. There are also
plans to fill Plane 2 with thousands of historic CJK characters, to
cover all characters found in some very comprehensive Asian dictionaries
(again, also character not used on computers today). So it is good to be
prepared for more than UCS-2.

UTF-16 is an extension of UCS-2 that uses a pair of 16-bit characters
from a high and low surrogate area in UCS-2 to represent characters in
planes 1 to 16 (U+010000 to U+10FFFF). UTF-16 can cover a bit over 1
million characters. It has been agreed between the Unicode consortium
and ISO that they will never standardize a character with a code >
U+10FFFF. So UTF-16 will be able to encode everything that will come in
the future. A code range of 1 million is commonly considered to be more
then good enough. Plenty of room for contact with
extraterrestrials ... ;-)

4-bytes per character is *more* then enough per character. UCS is just a
31-bit character set after all, so a signed 32-bit int (that is what
glibc's wchar_t is) will more then do. Even 3 bytes will last forever
and 2-bytes would be OK so far if you are prepared to handle pairs of
UTF-16 surrogate values as single characters.

> The UTF-8 encoding might be longer, of course.

No. Better have another careful look at how UTF-8 really works:

  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html

UTF-8 has no way of encoding characters more than 31-bit long.
A 32-bit integer will be able to hold the value of any legal
UTF-8 sequence.

XFree86 xterm is restricted to the UCS-2 range by the way, as is the X11
font mechanism.

My advice would be to try and keep UTF-8 as the in-memory encoding. Do
not convert to a fixed-width encoding unless really necessary for
table-lookups, etc. The self-synchronizing properties of UTF-8 make this
very feasible. You can even preserve illegal UTF-8 sequences this way
such that you loose no information if you load and save a binary file
accidentally in UTF-8 mode. Mined98 is doing this nicely, as are a
number of other existing UTF-8 editors. The plan for emacs is also to
keep UTF-8 as the in-memory representation, in the interest of binary
transparency.

> Are you saying that it's not possible to detect UTF-8 encoding reliably?

LC_CTYPE is the best detector you will ever get. It allows us so far to
distinguish ISO_8859-15 from JISX0208, and I see no reason why it should
suddenly fail on UTF-8. Everything else is just a heuristic. The
self-synchronizing properties of UTF-8 make it more feasible to write a
> 95% heuristic for UTF-8 then for other encodings, but you should be
careful to apply such autodetection ONLY when the user didn't tell you
explicitely via LC_CTYPE what the intended encoding is. The user must be
able to reliably enforce interpretation of the file as UTF-8 for
mission-critical applications, where the remaining risk of autodetection
or tagging is not acceptable.

I assure you, that UTF-8 files will not be tagged in any special way on
POSIX systems. Just like ASCII and ISO 646-Swedish files were never
tagged in any special way. Typed files are simply not the Unix way, for
very good reasons. There will be no BOM or ESC 2022 announcer, and if
there is one occasionally, it will either cause trouble or be lost after
the next cut & paste, grep, tail, conversion, etc. This stuff is not
robust in general. It might work in special restricted applications, but
not more. The world is already full of UTF-8 files. Search for UTF-8 on
dejanews, and you'll hit a hundred thousand postings, because Asian
versions of Netscape and IE have been sending out UTF-8 files for years.

Exactly, by offering them an option to leave the error-prone toggling
and character-set guessing domain.

The files are really not the problem. Files are very easily converted
without loss of information. The problem are applications that can
structurally not yet deal with files that can contain a million
different characters. Most applications believe that there exist not
more than 256 characters. That is the real problem.

I really think, they are the same, they were intended to be the same and
in my opinion they really should be the same. I like

  cat <file.txt

and

  cat >file.txt

to continue to work in our notion of plaintext also in the future,
therefore we should always aim towards keeping the content of plain-text
something that can be sent directly byte-for-byte to the terminal. Much
of the current simplicity, elegance and power of the Unix plaintext
world fundamentally depends on this. It won't be Unix any more if we
start to introduce plaintext file types. (By the way, we had this exact
same discussion already back in 1995 on comp.std.internat, should still
be in dejanews.)

How far do you want to implement autodetection? Do you want "ls" to
autodetect, whether a filename is in Latin-2, Latin-15, JIS X0208 or
UTF-8 and convert automatically accordingly? Character set
autodetection, if it really became common-place under Unix, would mean
that practically every application would have to be equipped with a
full-fledged any-to-any conversion package. Horrible prospect. No, I
really really think that separating the plain-text and terminal encoding
is a rather dangerous route, that I most certainly will not support in
any way. All this also has nothing to do with UTF-8, which is just yet
another encoding and should be treated just as such. The entire
autodetection or tagging business sounds to me very much like
reinventing ISO 2022 with all its consequences.

In interactive telecommunications, we have the following situation:

 1. Host sends "login:" (or any other prompt).
 2. User is supposed to type her ID (or any other response).

When using Unicode, the terminal emulator may not print the final character
of the prompt because it doesn't know yet whether any combining characters
will follow.  So the user doesn't know whether the host is ready to receive
a response and therefore should not reply since in some cases (e.g. at the
UNIX "Password:" prompt) an early response is discarded.

If the process is being executed by a script, the script sits and waits;
"waitfor 'login:'" will not succeed, since it can not be known whether
'login:' has arrived until the next base character after ':' comes, but no
such character is coming (I realize it is silly to expect a colon to have an
accent but those are the rules -- and not all prompts end with colon).

There is no escape from this situation other than introduction of a "higher
level protocol" to signal "ok, I'm finished transmitting, now it's your
turn", just like in the old half-duplex days.

This is the kind of reason that telecommunications-oriented applications
seem to be steering away from the Normalization Form D model, however
appropriate it might be in other areas, and embracing Normalization Form C
(ISO 10646 Level 1) and, by extension, precomposed characters, as we have
seen in Plan 9 and now, it seems, Linux.  I don't think this indicates
recalcitrance or West European bias in UNIX culture as much as a desire to
preserve telecommunications and the terminal/host model as a viable
interface between human and machine in the Unicode age, as it has been since
beginning of the computer age.  I also think it's no accident that Unicode
is best supported on those platforms that have eschewed the terminal/host
access model.

That's how terminals work.  If the host sends a character, the user should
see it on the screen immediately.  As any maker of terminal emulation
software can tell you, users are surprisingly intolerant of delays, even
very small ones.  The acid test is echoing in the full-duplex environment.
I press the 'A' key, the code for 'A' goes to the host and then comes back
to be displayed on the screen as an 'A'.  This must be instantaneous.

Or, to put it another way, a terminal is not a Web browser.

True, but the fact remains that a very large number of scripting applications
exist and are used every day in the real world, and they are used in
"mission-critical" applications too.  It is "a way of doing business" in a
world where platforms such as UNIX, VMS, VOS, VM/CMS, MVS/TSO, and OS/400
still exist and may be accessed openly.  Modems themselves are controlled
almost exclusively by scripts (how do you think your PPP dialer works?).

The business of Unicode is not to promote certain styles of computing and
obliterate others; it is to provide a universal character set that can be
used in any application.

Of course many people believe the answer is to modernize everything.  But
today this means replacement of simple, proven, and open means of access 
with proprietary and unstable ones.

But then is the application "Unicode compliant"?  But more to the point
(bearing in mind that we are speaking not just of logging in, but any prompt
and response), if we ignore the possibility that combining characters might
follow the trigger string, then we can have "false positives", or for that
matter also false negatives.

Yes, this is spelled out very clearly in the technical report.  In this way
Unicode Normalization Form C differs from ISO 10646 Implementation Level 1,
in which "a CC element shall not contain coded representations of combining
characters".  I think this more accurately represents the position taken by
the authors of Plan 9 and (correct me if I'm wrong) those working on the
Linux console and UTF-8 xterm.

The real problem comes in scripting.  Scripts are a method of forcing
intrinsically noncooperating processes to cooperate.  Suppose a script is
looking for "ABC", and ABC comes.  If the next character will be a combining
cedilla, this would not be a match.  But if no more characters are coming
(e.g. until there is some kind of response) then it would be, but how can
the script know?  The best we can do is set a timeout period that is long
enough to allow for the longest possible intercharacter spacing on the
busiest day of the Internet and hope we haven't guessed wrong.  And even if
we haven't, this technique would cause every match to consume the entire 
timeout interval.

Of course it is. If the application is waiting for "login:", it is not
waiting for "login:" with an acute accent on the colon. It is interpreting
what it is supposed to, given the characters encoded at the code
values they have. If the communicator then sends a combining acute accent,
that is a *protocol* error, not a Unicode compliance problem.

Once again, this would be a *protocol* error. If the communication protocol
is waiting for "xxxx", then it should act when it receives the final
"" as a unit, or if it has received an "a", then it should act when it
receives the final combining acute accent. And ordinarily the communication
protocol should specify a normalized form, so it doesn't have to deal
with alternative forms as equivalent for these purposes.

And many of these call/response protocols wait for a control code as the
trigger anyway, right? Very often the EOL. Otherwise they are rather
badly behaved, for interactive work anyway, since a host would then always
be sending bad typists irrelevant error messages without letting them
backspace and correct their errors before committing to send a chunk for
interpretation as a response/command/whatever.

And as the Unicoders have continually pointed out, Implementation Level 1
is a crutch for brain-damaged implementations that cannot handle anything
complex. It rules out support for all of the complex scripts of the world.
It does, however, do a reasonable job of covering Europe and East Asia,
aside from some minority languages. Hmmm. Sound like a recipe for maintaining
the computing access status quo to anyone?

By the EOL or other end-of-content marking built into the protocol.

How many of these script protocols can you point to that really are
sitting posed hair-triggered forever waiting for the right (character)
byte to come down the wire? Or if they are, isn't the triggering character
usually a control delimiter of some sort? If you are worried about
false positives for some string followed by a combining character,
why not that same string followed by *ANY* character. You would have
to guarantee that no long response has any prefix that could be
misinterpreted (before the response was completely received) as a
shorter response.

Why isn't this exactly the same problem for any prefix of any response,
even without combining characters?

Sounds like a purty flimsy strawman to me.

But there is no protocol.  Most prompts do not end with an EOL.

A script is by nature an attempt to codify human behavior in a
stimulus-response situation.  The stimuli are designed for people, not
protocols, and in any case are usually not changeable (maybe you can change
them, but as soon as you do be prepared for screams of agony to go up from
the masses who, unbeknownst to you, depend for the livelihood on the prompts
not changing).  Thus the script must adapt to whatever is on the other end
of the connection.

If the prompt is "login:" with no EOL, we can't force an EOL to come; ditto
for other dialog situations in which the prompt more likely to end with some
character that might reasonably be followed by a combining character (or not).

I believe this is what telecommunications-oriented platforms and/or
applications are doing when they avoid the issue of combining forms by saying
they don't support them.

Meaning Indic, Arabic, etc...  Of course this is true, and yet Level 1 exists
and developers will use it.  We have in UTF-8 a vigorous attempt to embrace
the "legacy" terminal/host world and existing applications to promote easy
migration from ASCII to Unicode (and somewhat less easy from 8-bit character
sets).  But these very platforms are accessed in a simple and open manner
which does not mesh well with complex scripts.

We might wish to wipe away the legacy of fifty years of computing and start
over (in more ways than one!) but I fear there will never be a replacement
for the simple and open terminal/host access method that will support
complex scripts and still be as open and vendor-neutral as the terminal/host
model.  We are suffering already from the lack of open (e.g. Telnet) access
to Macintosh and Windows platforms.

I'm not saying I know what to do, only that "throw away your medieval tools
and enter the modern age" is as likely to result in a new Tower of Babel as
it is to promote universal communication.  But this time the Babel is not in
character sets but in the profusion of ever-changing and incompatible
vendor- and application-specific protocols and data formats.

Perhaps it's all a tempest in a teapot.  For some time to come we will have
all possible combinations of "legacy" and Unicode-aware hosts and clients,
and we have to allow for each combination.  Different problems will come up
in each configuation, and we'll see how to deal with them.  My hope is that
it will not be by inventing a neverending stream of Three-Letter Acronyms to
"comply" with, on top of Unicode itself, just to get text from point A to
point B.  If you thought you hated ISO 2022, just think of the standards
nightmare that will grow out of that!

This is a topic that was discussed at great length in May-July 1997 and
then again in July-August 1999.  The upshot is, I need to write a draft
Unicode technical report to clarify what is meant by "plain text", and
to propose guidelines for vendor- and application-independent
self-contained preformatted Unicode plain text that can endure into the
distant future and remain useful even as fads and fancies change.

Anybody who would like to review the discussion so far should be able to
find it in the Unicode mail archive:

It's definitely a higher-level protocol.  It's just like music notation:
two-dimensional layout, uses symbols not otherwise found in plain text,
and relies heavily on the relative positioning of these symbols.

A computer encoding of baseball scoring notation would be cool, but it's
not within the scope of Unicode.

       >Really? What is plain text then?

       It is a fallacy to think that plain text *by itself* is ever
       fully semantically specified. If you receive a plain text
       document that consists of

       <file>I seem to be having problems with my lifestyle.</file>

       You might assume you know what the intended meaning is, i.e.
       that it is an English sentence, but you may be wrong. E.g., it
       could be a curse in the Blahurg language. The likelihood is
       that you'll be safe with your assumption in this case, but the
       possibility does exist that you'll be wrong. This is a rather
       contrived example, but it need not be:

       <file>chat</file>

       What is the meaning of this text? Is it the English word with a
       meaning related to 'discuss', is it a French word with the
       meaning 'cat', or is it something else?

       Plain text is defined, essentially, as a string of unadorned,
       abstract characters. There is nothing in the definition of
       plain text that says anything about the interpretation of the
       text being unambiguous.

       In the general case, plain text requires several items of
       additional information in order for it to be correctly
       interpreted, including at least the following:

       - encoding
       - character set
       - language

       You might say that the presence of xFE xFF in the first two
       bytes is sufficient to identify the encoding and character set,
       but it is not strictly sufficient. It's possible that this is a
       non-text binary file that happened to start with these two
       bytes. Likewise, language cannot in *any* case be determined
       from plain text with *100%* certainty.

       Now, it may be that in a lot of situations, one can in practice
       manage to correctly determine the intended interpretation of
       plain text without this additional information; e.g. if you get
       a file from a colleague, they probably don't have to identify
       this information for you explicitly for you to know what
       they're meaning to convey in the plain text file. But as a
       general principle, Ken's point is entirely correct.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit



       >THEREFORE, I propose that all such math symbols be encoded in
       the BMP, not in plane 1, even if it is necessary to split them
       between blocks to squeeze them in. Can we find 2000-odd code
       points in BMP? Math symbols are *too important* to be relegated
       to plane 1. They are more important than CJKV extensions (only
       about 5000 han characters are in common use), and more
       important than the scripts mentioned above and more important
       than Mongolian or Tibetan. [I am not advocating removal of
       these scripts or han characters.] All of expanding human
       knowledge is developed by writing and discussing scientific
       papers, and this is done internationally, and as more
       discoveries are made, it is urgent and necessary to encode
       these papers in a manner in which they can be indexed,
       accessed, and read on computer.

       >Do you know what a mess it would be to have to sign every math
       symbol character as a surrogate? Surrogates are OK for an
       occasional character, but not for numerous equations. That
       would significantly bloat text files of scientific papers with
       mathematical content. And think of what it would do towards the
       goal of putting mathematical texts on the Internet.


       Math symbols in the BMP? Please, no. I don't disagree that Math
       is important. (Having a B. Math degree, I'm also certainly a
       fan.) I'm just more concerned for living scripts that might be
       bumped as a result.

       The scripts you mentioned may not be important to a lot of
       people, but they're extremely important to those who use them.
       (By the way, just wanted to clarify that Thaana and Runic are
       *not at all* in the same category: Thaana is very much a living
       script: phone books, newspapers, etc.) And there are more like
       them that really should go into the precious few spots
       remaining in the BMP.

       Why these in the BMP rather than math?

       - Math requires specialized software to handle it regardless of
       where it's located. If the software is only interpreting the
       semantics of a math string, the fact that plane 1 characters or
       surrogates pairs are involved is not a problem. If the software
       is presenting math strings, then it needs specialised code for
       layout of formulas anyway, so it isn't a huge burden to add the
       need to handle plane 1 characters. (The developers/user
       community in question appear to already be in agreement to
       using plane 1.)

       - Other living scripts that are potential candidates for the
       BMP do not require specialized software; in general, it should
       be possible to work with these scripts using *any* app that is
       designed to support BMP text, including your favourite simple,
       Unicode-enabled, plain text editor. Putting a living script
       into plane 1 introduces the likelihood that that script will be
       place at a significant disadvantage for some time since it
       can't be used by *any* Unicode-enabled tool, but must be used
       with a smaller set of software. This will have a far worse
       impact on those language communities affected than would the
       math community be affected by putting the math stuff in plane
       1.

       As for text size, this is really a non-issue. In terms of
       storage, there is no real concern (I doubt anybody has a
       database with millions of records of math formulas), and in
       terms of transmission, it is very likely that the majority of
       text in a file containing math symbols will be prose text and
       not math formulas. The impact on the size of the math stings
       will likely be minimal.

       As for putting mathematical texts on the internet, the use of
       surrogates shouldn't be an issue; at least, any current
       concerns will be temporary limitations only. Eventually,
       browsers will all be able to handle surrogates, proably sooner
       than later. (In a browser, the main concern is the ability to
       render. An extension to the TrueType spec has already been made
       to allow for rendering of surrogates. I'll be somewhat
       surprised if the next version of IE doesn't have the ability to
       render surrogates.)

       If we could fit math on the BMP without any risk to living
       scripts for spoken languages, I'd be entirely for it. I'm not
       sure that's a safe assumption at this point, however.

Oh, what a good idea. Never mind the rest of us, who don't have that
particular product, eh? You know, if Microsoft didn't ship stuff that
screws up everything for others, I would be happy to sing its praises. I
would love to be able to say "This is a really good thing, enhancing
interoperability for everyone".

Instead, every time Microsoft comes out with a new product or document
format it seems like it chokes everyone who "lags behind" the "cutting
edge". If you think this isn't true, try using a nice reliable platform
with trusty software and then live in a world where people are (regularly)
forced to (pay money to upgrade) to the cutting edge just to _read_ a
simple document.

It crashed Netscape 4.05 for the Macintosh, which I am using and have been
using for some time.

"Down level browsers"? That's rather arrogant. There was nothing wrong with
my browser, until suddenly Microsoft's new product started spouting all
kinds of junk into HTML documents which those browsers (which use standard
HTML) were not designed to read. I am sure that Arnold, expert user as he
is, will be comforted to know that he can produce documents formatted in a
way acceptable to most of us.

Netscape 4.05 for the Macintosh. And apparently other people had problems
as well.

I will look at this site, and am curious to know whether it supplies a
Macintosh version. However, here is the logic. Arnold sends out a document.
I don't know what it is about. I look at it. It crashes Netscape. I fire up
this new tool to strip out the crap from it. Finally I can read the
document and find out (as I have in this case) that it is irrelevant to me.
What a colossal time-waster.

I was always satisfied with "Helvetica" but note in passing that Ariel is a

something else.

The more you overtick the plumbing, the easier it is to stop up the drain.
Here, dear colleagues, is an analysis of what Word 2000 is doing in this
instance. Statistics are taken from ClarisWorks' word-count feature.

                      Plain text         HTML     Crap ratio
Number of characters:       1279        19772     6% content, 94% crap
Number of words:             192         1085    18% content, 82% crap
Number of lines:              53          636     8% content, 92% crap
Number of paragraphs:         48          572    17% content, 83% crap
Number of pages:               2           15    13% content, 87% crap

In order to be fair to Word 2000, and considering for the sake of argument
_all_ markup to be crap, I set Arnold's document as an ordinary HTML
document with PageSpinner in the way I normally do. Compare the results
with the above.

                      Plain text         HTML     Crap ratio
Number of characters:       1279         1667    77% content, 23% crap
Number of words:             192          217    88% content, 18% crap
Number of lines:              53           75    71% content, 29% crap
Number of paragraphs:         48           67    72% content, 28% crap
Number of pages:               2            2   100% content,  0% crap

Gosh, Word 2000 does seem to add an awful lot of crap.

Consider some mere mortals like my mother and my brother, as opposed to us
highly-motivated experts. If we have these problems, what hope have the
teeming millions? The "unbelievability" of Arial being described as
"mso-bidi-font-family:Arial" is an indication of the total waste to be
incurred on my poor mother's hard disk, on the bandwidth carrying the
message, and on my poor brother's hard disk, when all that my mother was
trying to send was a 192-word message about visiting at Christmas. What is
unbelievability is the crudeness of the hack. This 26-character string
"mso-bidi-font-family:Arial" is repeated _45_ times in Arnold's document!
That's 1170 characters, a mere 6% of the 94% of the crap in that document.
And bidirectionality is totally irrelevant to my mother and my brother,
isn't it? It took me about an hour and a half to deal with this situation
including writing this e-mail.

I'm of a mind to send this to the Unicode list, but I suppose I won't.

Am I Microsoft bashing? I don't think I am. I think they've done something
they should quickly undo, and with an apology besides.

So you think plain text should be replaced by HTML?  And then all the software
on earth should be changed to be "HTML-compliant"?  Which HTML?  How often
must all the software in the world be changed to keep up with it?  What
happens when HTML itself is overtaken by some new buzzword?

>>HTML mail really is better than plain text mail.

>Why?

Just to take a simple example, italic and bold carry important distinctions
which make meaning clearer. Both are missing from plain text email unless
you consider ***bold*** to be a substitute. Or more importantly to me HTML
mail reformats paragraphs to fit the available screen width. Most mail
programs just wrap plain text in stupid ways or force you to scroll
horizontally. I think I can read HTML mail at least 50% faster. Don't forget
that we got at least that much speedup of reading when most people finally
gave up all uppercase plain text mail. I don't have any proof but I think I
understand written material better if I can read it as fast as I think
without being slowed down for some artificial reason.

You've got to be kidding!  Of the thousands of web sites I have browsed, I can
count the number I find legible on one hand.  It is so bad now that I don't
even bother reading web pages; I just look for URL's.

And don't blame the systems and mail handlers for not dealing with markup
because most of them do so in one way or another.  The point is that those of
us working in plain text are doing so by choice, not necessity.  And why do we
choose plain text?  In my case, I find that text with markup noticeably slows
my reading speed and comprehension.  In short, if the text isn't "designed"
well enough, I can't read it and usually just delete it.

I am one of those people who find most of the "rich text" out there in
presentation form too distracting to really be useful.  Call it "attention
deficit disorder," "aesthetic elitism," "Luddism," or whatever, I just find
the majority of documents on the web as seen through a browser unpalatable to
the point of being unreadable.

I agree with it wholeheartedly and greatly enjoyed your rant.  I appreciate
it especially because I use a plain-text non-MIME email client, so when
people send *me* html, I see html.  When they send me anything encoded in
base64, I see base64.  Now I can understand why they might want do this for
pictures or a sound clip, but for a few lines of text???

Why would I use a plain-text, non-MIME email client in this day and age?
Because it does everything I want it to, it's stable, it doesn't infect my
my computer with viruses, and I have the source code and can fix it if I
have to.  And because I'm a fast touch-typer -- in the time it takes me to
reach for the mouse and hunt for some tiny widget to click on, I can whiz
through 20 email messages, deleting the 15 of them that are junk-mail
(which, by the way, is almost always filled with Michael's famous "crap" :-)

With email, I have the same feeling about plain text as I do about
handwriting in postal mail.  If a hand-addressed letter arrives, it gets top
priority.  If a glossy multicolored item with glaring headlines arrives, it
goes directly into the trash.

I think the Universal Character Set is best understood -- and in fact should
ONLY be understood -- with reference to plain text.  Of course it CAN be used
in all kinds of GUI Web browsers, office suites, etc, but it must not depend
on notions that only apply to GUIs, because all such notions are ephemeral.
Plain text is forever.

Hmmm.  Speaking stylistically, "ephemeral" has too many syllables to be good  
poetry.  If you're going to make a hummable tune for the refrain, try:

	All such notions be conceit,
	but Plain Text is for-e-ver...

Kind of an "Ein feste Burg" for the Unicodification Church...

Hummed to Ein feste Burg, these lines require the addition of
phantom syllables for the extra notes:

     All such no(uh)tions be(ee) conceit,
     but Plai(ai)n Text is for(or)-e-ver..

Whereas, Frank's text scans as a perfect iambic pentameter blank verse
couplet:

     But all such notions are ephemeral,
      -   '   -    '  -    '  -  ' - '
     And plain text is forever -- Frank da Cruz.
      -   '     -   '   - ' -       '    -   '

A suitable contribution to "The Unic Ode".

Ah, sorry to put you off the track... I was merely *comparing* this couplet  
to the grandeur of "Ein feste Burg" as an expression of lofty, noble, and

Whereas, without the addition of "Frank da Cruz"himself into the couplet,

But it's not. It seems simple: mathematicians want to represent their data
in plain text, and have shown that they can do so with this solution, and
that they can't with other solutions. The question is, should they be
facilitated in this, or should they not?

It appears that you are a new-comer to the history of Han characters in
Unicode.

The point here is that Unicode is unwilling to treat Han characters the same
way that some mathematicians (my mathematician friend who uses serif /
sans-serif was actually trying to point out that the distinctions
mathematicians want are open-ended) want their characters treated. I am not
trying to belittle mathematical usage.

A Japanese user would like to see the actual Japanese forms of Han
characters in plain text and sometimes be able to mix in other Han
languages. They would like to search on Japanese text and not hit Chinese
han characters. They believe their characters to be as different from
Chinese as some of the mathematicians believe that bold forms of the Roman
alphabet are different from plain forms. 

Unicode does not provide an architecture to support Han characters the way
that most users of Han characters want them supported. Despite the many
attempts to revise its history, Unicode in fact was never meant to support
plain or simple (no layout required) text. If it had been meant to support
plain text, we would have started thinking in terms of a full 32 bit
encoding since even in 1988 it was clear that 16 bits would not be
sufficient for a plain-text model. The solutions offered to Han characters
users were always couched in terms of some form of attributed text. Over the
years, Unicode has given in to smaller, more aggressive constituencies who
argued the need for handling their favorite set of characters in plain text
and who managed to find a champion in the UTC. The result is that some areas
might be capable of being handled in plain text, but not the largest and
most controversial sub-range, the Han.

Good questions, for which I think we can come up with workable (if not
theologically and cosmically "true") answers.   By workable I mean something
along the lines of "a system of terms, definitions, etc. that serves to
closely model the 'real' semiotics of written language (and thus answer to
the expectations of literate communities) for the purposes of formal
language design and software specification (thus answering to the
expectations of software vendors)".  I think it is possible to agree on a
fairly precise set of formal definitions for modeling written language by
drawing on linguistics, semiotics, mathematical logic, etc.  Stuff that's
been around for quite some time, actually.

The first thing I would note is that our ordinary means of discourse is
incredibly impoverished when it comes to talking about written language.  We
have quote marks and and various typographic conventions and that's about
it.  Very flexible, but not very precise.  So take for example your question
"is 'f' a semiotic unit": you could be referring to the graphical thingee,
or the phonological thingee, or a third thingee, or maybe even the
sign-function thingee that ties some or all of these other thingees
together.  Etc.  (I would answer yes in each case.)  Great fun, actually.
And I'm not picking on your usage; examine almost any piece of writing by
any specialist that discusses grammatology, and you'll find it shot through
with informal usage that relies on the reader to figure out which register
to use in interpreting things like 'f' (or should that be "'f'"?).  Watch
how often it happens on this list.

In any case, to answer your questions, I would start by positing that we
need to model two things at least, one being the visual aspect of written
language (graphemes, visual syntax, etc.) (i.e. the signifiers), and the
other being the things denoted by such forms.  I think Unicode works on the
former, not the latter.  I don't have a good term for the latter yet, but
for now let's call them "grammemes".  ("Cultural unit" is a tad too general
and would cover just about everything.  I guess we could go for the TLA:
GCU = grammatical cultural unit.  Wheee!)

Grammemes are not phonemes.  Research has shown that reading does not
necessarily involve phonological activity in the brain.  (If you're
interested I can supply the references).  The set of grammemes associated
with a particular written language amounts to a theory of language.  They
represent the cognitive categories literates use to think about language,
and don't necessarily follow modern linguistic analyis.  "Grammeme" because
the line between basic units such as "letters" in the traditional sense and
higher-level grammatical concepts is blurry in some languages.  Arabic
provides several examples, ta marbuta being the most obvious.  Either a
medial ta form or a final dotted heh form may represent ta marbuta in
Arabic, but the name "ta marbuta" itself denotes a complex packaging of
rules relating phonology, morphology, and syntax.  It is not considered an
element of the traditional Arabic alphabet, but it is definitely part of
basic Arabic orthography and literacy - one should be able to search on it,
for example.  So it's a grammeme.

I seem to have slipped into dissertation mode again.  Sorry 'bout that.  To
get back to your questions, I would say that by 'f' we designate a pairing
of graphic form and grammeme - a sign-function, in semiotic terms.  'I' is
another; the fact that it can enter into other semiotic (lexical) relations
can be disregarded, since our guide is the set of 'letter' grammemes
associated with (pick your language.)  'if' is not encoded because the
community of literates doesn't think of the graphic form as denoting a
single irreducable grammeme - if it did, then it would merit a code point,
as 'ch' in some languages surely does.  

This does not mean that the graphical form used to represent it cannot be
analyzed into consituent parts that are themselves encoded.  It would not be
problematic to say that the grammeme 'if' may be represented visually by the
sequence of two _graphemes_ 'i' and 'f'.  But "grammeme i" plus "grammeme f"
does not equal "grammeme if" though they might equal "lexeme if" - that
would be for higher level protocols to decide.  U+0BCA TAMIL VOWEL SIGN O, I
am willing to bet, is considered by Tamil literates a single form denoting a
single grammeme.  But it would be entirely reasonable to analyze the form
used to denote that grammeme into its constituent parts and encode them
separately _qua graphic forms_ without a corresponding grammeme denotatum.

I think so.  Also of its notion of plain text, and the whole underlying
notion of "script without language".  It's not the worst idea in the world,
but it comes at a cost, and I've never seen a real careful analysis of what
we (well, not me and my pals but certainly others) give up by adopting
Unicode's modeling strategy.

Must have had a lot to do with it.  But on the other hand, I don't think a
more balanced approach would necessarily mean software designs incompatible
with today's software.

If it were a question of standardizing widget interfaces it wouldn't matter
much, but we're talking about standardizing a model of language, which is
pretty close to home for everybody.

Add another possible cause:  specialization.  Very few people are insane
enough to try to master the disparate fields (computer science, mathematical
logic, linguistics, textual theory, psycholinguistics, etc etc) that
converge here.  Most of the people in the humanities with whom I've
discussed Unicode have almost no clue as to what plain text is, let alone
how formal modeling works.  I don't mean that the people involved are not
qualified, only that the pool is pretty small.

Cheers,

Gregg

Why is the burden of proof on the users of the language?  I would turn the
question around:  is it really _necessary_ to leave slovak/czech "ch" out of
Unicode?

I don't see what plaintext, sorting and hyphenation have to do with it.
Slovak and Czech literates have this thing within their culture, and they
use "ch" denote it.  So if plaintext doesn't accomodate "ch", then it must
not be plain text for Slovaks and Czechs.  Why do we need more information
than that?

Utterly perplexed,

Gregg

Well, I just read through your list archive, and I think you are more
of an idealist than I can afford to be.  You keep saying, "If Plan 9
can do a complete conversion, so can we."  But you'll notice that
people aren't in fact using Plan 9, by and large.  Plan 9 is a research
project.  It doesn't have millions of installations or millions of
interconnections with other installations.

Don't get me wrong.  Perl will work fine in your idealized world.  But
I intend it to work okay in the other world too.  I simultaneously try
to keep my head in the clouds and my feet on the ground.  Sometimes
it's a stretch, though.

: They

: standard (BOM, line separator, etc.), and thereby completely forgot the
: big UTF-8 prime directive under Unix:
: 
:   UTF-8 is ASCII compatible

Sure, and Perl banks on that to a great extent, but much of the world is
not ASCII compatible.

: Not only the encoding, but also the use of it.

Er, only until you actually start trying to use it for anything both
useful and un-American, like sorting, or updating your screen...

: So don't change anything
: about how ASCII was used when introducing UTF-8, because only this means
: that UTF-8 can truly substitute ASCII in a realistic way:

To the extent possible, I agree with you.  :-)

: This means the following:
: 
:   - A UTF-8 Unix plain text file that contains only ASCII characters
:     (and this is the majority of files on Unix installations all over
:     the world) will *not* change a single bit.

That may be true, but I don't think it's true enough.  49% of the files
in the world could be in non-ASCII, and your statement would still be
strictly true.  But not terribly useful.  The problem is not so much
files as it is interfaces.  What percentage of the text you use comes
from the system you're on?  How is that percentage changing over time?
What about if you're running a Linux set-top box that doesn't even have
a disk?  Or closer to current reality, did that tar file you just
unpacked come from a UTF-8 only system?  Will your browser convert text
to UTF-8 when it saves it?  What's coming down that socket you just
opened?  What's coming out of the file descriptor my process just
inherited?  Was it a pipe to a process on my machine, or was it a
foreign port?

I'm not suggesting there is an easy answer to this.  In fact, I'm
suggesting there isn't.  And that any suggestion that there is isn't.

:   - This means that there is never a BOM at the start of a file. BOMs could

:     not ignored by the many existing ASCII programs. Adding a

:     prime directive, as BOMs are definitely not ASCII compatible.

I don't like BOMs either, in case you missed that.  Of course, I loathe
UTF-16 too, so that's not too terribly surprising.  Surrogate characters
are too pukey to contemplate.

:   - This means that lines in UTF-8 plaintext files are terminated
:     in one and only one way: 0x0a = LF. Neither U+2028 (line separator,
:     introduced for use inside *.doc-style word processing binary files)
:     nor overly long UTF-8 sequences for LF such as 0x80 0x8a must be accepted

:     moving from ASCII to UTF-8. U+2028 is treated just like any other
:     character and has no special meaning in a Unix plaintext file.

Fine by me, till someone asks to treat a file otherwise, in which case
they should be let.  What's more at issue is whether a *file* should be
able to request being treated otherwise, if we give the user the right
to request that files be given the right to request that they be so
treated.  Or some such.  :-)

: How do applications find out that files are now in UTF-8? Simple
: applications such as cat and echo do not have to. For them UTF-8 is
: just like ASCII.

You oversimplify again.  Even "cat -v" has to know how to treat bytes
with the high bit set.  And "echo -e" probably wants a way to interpolate
characters larger than can be interpolated by \nnn.

: However, programs which count characters, position
: cursors, determine character classes, use regexp, etc. have to know
: about the file encoding, and there are well-established mechanisms to do
: that: they are told, preferably via established POSIX mechanisms
: (LC_CTYPE, LANG), or via other command line switches.

You have a major showstopper here as far as us Perl folks are
concerned.  Neither the environment nor the command line can be trusted
in a setuid situation.  The Perl community is for this reason
particularly leary of anything having to do with locales.  I noticed
that you frequently invoke the name of POSIX on your mailing list, but
that won't work here.  Around here people will actually shudder if you
say "POSIX".

: Ideally, all that should be necessary to turn a Unix installation into a
: pure UTF-8 system is the addition of the line
: 
:   export LC_CTYPE=UTF-8
: 
: in /etc/profile, plus conversion of the existing ISO 8859, JIS, KOI8,
: etc. files and file names.

No.  It is not ideal.  If you're going to have a kernel-wide switch,
then ideally the kernel should tell the process.  The environment
simply cannot be trusted, any historical POSIX botches to the contrary
notwithstanding.  You've been arguing for LC_CTYPE for several months
now.  I hope you haven't argued for it for so long that you can't see
its problems anymore.

As for Perl, although it will ideally keep everything as UTF-8
internally, it'll still be assuming that it has to know on an
interface-by-interface basis whether to expect UTF-8 or something
else.  Even on your idealized Linux, we'll still have to know what to
do with the sockets connected to the real world.  It is not so much
more of a stretch for us to decide on a file-by-file basis, using the
best available information.  On your ideal system, the best available
information might be that we should always guess files to be UTF-8.
That's fine.  But please don't use the environment to convey such
important, system-wide information.

: Editors and terminal emulators will then
: activate their UTF-8 modes, email software will convert received
: messages from the indicated MIME character set into UTF-8 before saving
: them as a file, etc. We are not quite there yet, but that should be the
: long-term goal.

I would like that too.  But Perl has always been about getting from here
to there, and this is very much a getting-from-here-to-there problem.

Nevertheless, I do appreciate idealists--at least as long as they're
not collectivizing the peasants, some of whom were my third cousins
living in the Ukraine before they were starved to death.  So I feel I
owe it to them to be able to distinguish Unicode from Russian.

When the whole world joins your collective, I'll say I believed in it
all along.  :-)

That is not true.  "lines" in UTF-8 text files may be terminated by 
LINE FEED, CARRIAGE RETURN, CARRIAGE RETURN+LINE FEED, NEXT LINE,
or end-of-file, or be separated by LINE SEPARATOR or PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR
(which is in some sense 'stronger' than line separator).

(I don't know what originally came before the "This means that" in
Markus's message.)

That is not true.  LINE SEPARATOR and PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR were once
introduced in the hope that they would "clear up the line ending mess".
(Whether they are used in ".doc"-style documents is a separate issue.)
That hope has not come to fruition yet, and it will take time before
the "line ending mess" is overcome whatever way is used to overcome it.
Unicode Technical Report 13, Unicode Newline Guidelines
(http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr13/), gives some guidelines
on how to increase the interoperability with regard to "new line
function" (NLF) and LS/PS handling.  Basically the recommendation is
to accept all commonly occurring NLFs: CR, CR+LF, LF, the EBCDIC
originated NL (NEXT LINE; U+0085; admittedly rare), as well as
LS and PS (and allow EOF to 'terminate a line').  I think they
should be accepted in any mixture.

Most(?) C compilers already appear to handle at least both LF and CR+LF
(mixed) fairly well.  This makes it easier to handle C source files in a
"mixed environment".  Shell scripts, yacc/bison files, etc. are still
problematic since their lexers still expect only LF.


> :     nor overly long UTF-8 sequences for LF such as 0x80 0x8a must be
accepted

True, unduly long UTF-8 encodings in general should be considered malformed.

U+2028 and U+2029 should be handled as just another way of
indicating line separation/end (as should end-of-file) for the
purposes of perl/C/lex/bison/Ada/etc. Neither of these need to
distinguish between line and paragraph separation, and all of
these ways of terminating/separating lines should be treated
the same, for increased interoperability.

Of course, to be able to detect NL, LS, and PS one needs to know
the character encoding first, since they have different codes and
are indeed not possible to represent in all encodings.  But the
same goes for NL and CR too really, if UTF-16 is allowed, which
it should be in at least some circumstances. (No, I don't like
little endianism nor "BOM".)

Note that several programming languages, e.g. Java, Ada, and C,
allow non-ASCII in identifiers, with identifier identity defined
via the UCS. But they don't require a particular character
encoding for the source files, so compilers for these programming
languages MUST 'know' the character encoding of an individual
source file (via a compiler flag, system/individual/folder default,
or similar) in order to compile the source code correctly anyway.
Similarly for XML and its tag and attribute names, but each XML
file should self-declare which character encoding it is in.

Which way of ending/terminating lines should be prefered on output?
Might depend on a preference setting, or an editing change (like
"turn all NLFs into LS").

The crucial bit of my original message that you missed was:

  I have just read through the list archive, and noted that a few people
  might have some doubts about how UTF-8 is used under Unix. They
  apparently got confused by many of the features described in the Unicode
  standard (BOM, line separator, etc.), and thereby completely forgot the
  big UTF-8 prime directive under Unix:

    UTF-8 is ASCII compatible

  Not only the encoding, but also the use of it. So don't change anything
  about how ASCII was used when introducing UTF-8, because only this means
  that UTF-8 can truly substitute ASCII in a realistic way:

  This means the following:

    - A UTF-8 Unix plain text file that contains only ASCII characters
      (and this is the majority of files on Unix installations all over
      the world) will *not* change a single bit.

  [...]

There are many nice ideas written up in the Unicode standard and the
associated technical reports, however they are not a dogma and each idea
has to be critically reviewed before you even consider introducing them
into an existing environment. It should become very quickly clear to the
alert reader of these documents that many of the mechanisms described
there (most notably the byte-order-mark and the new-line semantics) are
irrelevant for the use of UTF-8 as a backwards compatible migration path
for ASCII plaintext files on Unix systems.

Unix never had any new line ambiguity. It was always LF and only LF. It
would be really foolish for us to introduce a brand new new-line
ambiguity (via say the line separator) on Unix systems just because we
read about shiny new alternative ways in a Unicode technical report.

The original AT&T Bell Labs developers of Unix have already studied back
in 1992, how ISO 10646 is best used on Unix-style systems. They
concluded to replace ASCII completely by UTF-8 on their experimental
Unix-successor system Plan9 and reported about the excellent practical
experiences that they made in this process in a now legendary USENIX
paper, which I am sure you all are well familiar with:

  ftp://ftp.informatik.uni-erlangen.de/pub/doc/ISO/charsets/UTF-8-Plan9-paper.ps.gz

If the outside world does something different (they always have, you
listed the three most popular other newline conventions CR, CRLF, and
NL, yourself), then we will continue to convert, either automatically or
manually, as appropriate.

The handling of newline ambiguity by C under Unix has always been a NOP.
C under Unix is to completely ignore the "b" mode option of fopen(). The
"b" option is a hack for the rest of the world to allow it to handle its
Unix incompatibilities.

I have nothing against introducing besides the normal "plain text" also
a new text file format that we could call "unformatted plain text". It
would be a stream of characters interrupted by Unicode paragraph
separator characters. The PS and LS characters would have exactly the
same role as a <P> and <BR> in HTML or a \par and \hfil\break in TeX.

Such an additional file type notion would indeed be interesting to have
available, but it would not be used for formatted plain text files such
as 

  - software source code
  - configuration files
  - shell scripts
  - everything sent to standard output

etc. for obvious reasons of backwards compatibility. An unformatted
text format (and a whole range of new tools or new modes of existing
tools to support handling it) would however be very convenient for
file types such as

  - HTML/SGML/XML
  - TeX
  - nroff

where the formatting of the plain-text file is discarded anyway. It
would save us having to press paragraph-reformat so frequently in
editors, and it would make diff files smaller, because paragraphs would
not contain any more any formatting indicators such as LF that have to
be rearranged throughout the entire paragraph is you change just a
single word. For normal "plain text" files, the process writing a
paragraph has fixed the positions of the line breaks, for "unformatted
plain text" files, the process reading the paragraphs is responsible to
think about placing line breaks. Just as in TeX, HTML, etc.

There is nothing wrong, with having these note-pad style unformatted
plain text files as well supported under Unix, but it is important to
make clear that this is an entirely new file type with no relationship
to the existing plaintext notion.

The distinction of the two file types is easy: If it contains at least
one LF character, it is a normal plain text file, if it does not contain
a single LF character (but zero or more PS and/or LS characters), then
is is a new/style unformatted plaintext file. Either way, you'll find
out soon enough when reading the file at the end of the first line
(formatted) or paragraph (unformatted).

I have one quibble with your hard and fast distinction between the two
file types here.  And that is that Perl scripts themselves might want
to be both types simultaneously!  It's considered good style to put the
documentation into the same file as the code it documents, and while
the code certainly wants to be newline delimited, the documentation is
in POD format, and it would be perfectly fine to treat POD text paragraphs
as a word processor would.  In fact, POD was specifically designed
so that filled paragraphs could be distinguished from non-filled text on
the basis of the first character of the paragraph.

The only problem I see offhand with allowing both styles in the same
file is that different tools might count lines differently.  If Perl
says there's a syntax error at line 582, it might mean it has seen 581
instances of /\012 | \015\012 | \015 | \X{2028} | \X{2029}/x before the
error.  (For folks listening in, that works out to Unix newline, Windows
newline, Mac newline (!), Unicode line separator and Unicode paragraph
separator.)  If your "normal plain text" editor then counts only \012
(Unix newline), the programmer isn't going to be able to find the error.

On the other hand, maybe Perl would just count newlines, and your
editor counts it the other way.  More likely, some editors count one
way, and other editors count another.  Maybe they count LS but not PS,
just as Perl currently counts \n but not \f as a line transition.
There are many possiblities.

All I'm really arguing here is that it would be good to establish a
line counting convention.  But if that convention pretends there won't
be files mixing the two line delimitation styles, that will have other
ramifications, including possibly an adverse impact on portability.
Counting line numbers right is already pretty complicated when you have
NFS mounts from foreign systems.  Adding in Unicode will only make
things more complicated.  There will be some pressure to use Unicode
LS/PS in portable code, and I'm not sure you want to spend the rest of
your life resisting that pressure.  A lot of the "fixes" in Perl are
only there because we got tired of people asking the same questions
over and over.

I think assuming that files will only be one style or the other will
put us into that sort of a situation, and it would be nice to head it
off early, for some definition of early.  Just telling people by fiat
that they can't mix the two styles is not likely to work in the absence
of universal education.  Unfortunately, the education of the illegitimi
tends to result in carborundum.

Hi!

	Larry is right in that there is (already, also under Unix)
other ways of separating lines: namely form feed, but also vertical
tab. I must admit that I have never used vertical tab, and very
rarely form feed... Anyway C9x says: "\v (vertical tab) Moves the
active position to the initial position of the next vertical tab
position." And there is a similar statement about form feed. I
assume that is not too far off from what other standards might say.  

	So, the interoperable line (or 'stronger') separators in
"plain text" are:

	\X{2028}|\X{2029}|\r\n|\n|\r|\f|\v|\X{85}

(I'm probably mixing Perl and C (and flex) syntax here.) Some
of them are "stronger" in some senses than line separation,
but for the purposes of counting logical lines, and deciding
logical line begin and logical line end, there should be no
difference.  A single logical line may be *dynamically* wrapped 
into several displayed lines, but that is a different matter.

	Note that there are some "legacy" encodings which do not
have any or all of \f|\v|\X{85}.

	(I still think the idea of having two different kinds
of "plain text" is a bad idea.  I haven't heard anyone else
entertain it either.)

		Kind regards

If the kernel is to look for a UTF-8 BOM, it might as well look for a
general encoding marker.  That seems to be what you are using the BOM for.
There is no byte order to be marked in UTF-8 texts, is there?

If the kernel is to be changed, why not go to the roots and introduce an
filetype field into the inode table, similar to the permissions field,
with commands like

	$ chft "text/plain; charset=utf-8" file1.txt 
	$ chft "text/plain; charset=iso-8859-1" file2.txt 
	$ chft "image/png" file.png

and a 

	/etc/filetypes

table that associates mime types to code numbers in a
tending-to-become-standardized way?

That could at least ensure that no BOMs are misplaced during 

	$ cat file1.txt file2.txt > file.txt

and might solve a lot of other problems.

Yes.  In MIME text a line end is CRLF, period.

These are required for minimal, understandable encoding of various languages
(mainly bidi scripts, but the ZWJ and ZWNJ are also necessary for the Indic
scripts, at least).  These are NOT gadgets introduced by the high-flying
Unicode folks solely for fancy GUI settings, they are there to meet plain
text requirements.  The legacy encodings for those languages that
10646/Unicode integrated (ASMO, ISCII, etc.) had similar controls, by
necessity.

These are crap.  The Unicode standard 2.0 says that their use is
"<em>strongly</em> discouraged".  Note however that at least the NATIONAL
DIGIT SHAPE stuff does come, AFAIK, from old encodings used in terminal
applications, not fancy GUI stuff.

Ah!  the infamous BOM!  It has a valid use in plain text in indicating a

These are specifically defined not to be used in plain text.  They are meant
to be used, for instance, in a word processor that keeps text and "markup"
(formatting info) in separate memory structures.  The markup can use those
beasties as place holders in the text, to indicate where the markup applies.

The scripts are new to 3.0.  I'm quite sure those guys were not introduced
lightly and have a real requirement in plain text for the relevant scripts.

Please note that if you "fix" the m4 program this way it'll break.  I
think the m4 style of quoting preceded any similar TeX, GNU or X Windows
usage by quite a long time, and quite possibly led to those other
usages.  At least, m4 is the first place I ever saw that style of
quoting used pervasively.

Also, please don't "fix" programs like Perl or the shells, which don't
use `quote' style, but rather `quote` style.  So any fix like

    perl -pi.bak -e "s/\`/'/g;" file1 file2 ...

is going to have extremely bad consequences in those programs.

Frankly, I think you're going to run into a lot of people who feel as
strongly about their quotes as you feel about newlines.  That is,
to paraphrase your newline article:

    While the POSIX world is in need of a new character encoding, it is
    definitely not in need of new quote semantics. The two are fully
    orthogonal issues, and the Unicode standard has nothing useful to
    offer for POSIX on the quote issue.

Mind you, that's not my opinion, exactly.  I'm considerably more easy
going on the subject.  But I think there will be others who are harder
going, and I'm playing devil's advocate here.  Standards aside, is
there any *actual* use of grave and acute accents in a symmetrical
`quote' fashion?  Or is it merely notional?  Surely under Unicode most
real accents will be combining or composed characters.  So why inflict a
most unused symmetry condition on people who are using an actual symmetry?

I don't think quoting standards is gonna cut it for the folks who feel
strongly about that.  You're likely to have a cultural war on your hands.

Me, I'm neutral, but I'll be glad to trade with both sides...

I can't speak about 'makeinfo', but for the run-time messages of
internationalized programs the following approach is possible:

  - Use a .po file in UTF-8 format, and use U+2018/U+2019 as left and
    right quote delimiters.

  - The GNU gettext library shall convert the messages from the .po file's
    encoding to the current locale's character set (i.e. ISO-8859-1 in
    many cases). This is already partially implemented.

  - GNU gettext uses iconv. If the U+2018/U+2019 quotes cannot be
    represented in the current locale's character set, iconv can choose
    appropriate replacement characters (acute and grave accent or, as a
    last fallback, the vertical apostrophe).
    This will be easily implemented in the free iconv implementations
    (glibc-iconv, libiconv, freebsd-iconv). The non-free iconv
    implementations are so low quality that they are unusable.

  - Programmers must use vertical apostrophe or double quotes in the
    english messages in the C source. (The standard way to put Unicode
    characters into a wide char string, \unnnn, is not yet implemented
    by most compilers.)

  - As a consequence, a message catalog for English must be introduced,
    in order to map
          "He said: 'Hello world!'"
    to
          "He said: \u2018Hello world!\u2019"

Throughout this whole discussion of ligatures in Latin and the proposed
(or at least bandied-about) ZERO-WIDTH LIGATOR characters, one issue
keeps bothering me.  I'm not sure how terrific it would be to allow (or
require) a ZWL and ZWNL to achieve ligation, and what new problems this
would create, but at the same time I'm uncomfortable with leaving this
issue up to the font vendors, and I think Marco Cimarosti summed it up
perfectly:

The idea that a particular font "technology" (where I use the word in
its marketing sense that is closer to "vendor's product" than "set of
capabilities") is necessary to render Unicode plain text properly is the
first step toward having that vendor claim that its products are the
only ones that support Unicode.

Obviously, some advanced font capabilities *are* necessary to render all
of Unicode properly.  (Note, BTW, the use of plain text to indicate
italics, obviating the need for a special Unicode character to indicate
this markup.)  For instance, you cannot render Arabic without choosing
the contextually appropriate glyph.  But this is a long way from saying
"You need AAT" or "You need OpenType."  The latter would send the
message that Unicode support requires specific vendors' products, and we
could be back where we started decades ago, with each vendor devising
its own character encoding solutions.

AAT, OpenType, or some equivalent technology is and always has been a
prerequisite for displaying Unicode.  The standard has been designed from
the beginning with the assumption that an intelligent rendering engine is
available which can implement the character-glyph model in some fashion and
display N characters using M glyphs with rearrangement and reshaping along
the way.  

Unicode has also made the assumption that out-of-band information is
required to provide the full range of "proper" display required by users --
e.g., in Unihan where it's acknowledged that Japanese readers won't want to
see characters written using Taiwanese glyphs.

"Plain text" in Unicode means (theoretically) the minimal amount of
information for legible display.

In this sense, using bitmapped fonts is conformant if and only if the bitmap
font technology can implement the character-glyph model and would be better
off if some kind of outside markup were available to finesse the display and
provide the not-plain-text information.

I think John's response is a bit overblown. It is true that the designers
of the Unicode Standard have always (meaning since 1988 at least) assumed
the availability of an "intelligent rendering engine" as part of the text
handling model for Unicode. But in so doing they were thinking, from the
outset, about the issues of combining marks, ligatures and conjuncts, bidirectional
text handling, and other complexities inherent to the full scope of written text.
It was obvious from the start that no character-cell terminal with bitmaps
was up to the general task, and that a several-layer abstraction between
characters in a text backing store and dots in a display raster was going
to be necessary to do justice to the general problem of rendering.

BUT... conformance to the Unicode Standard does *not* mean that you have
to implement a rendering engine that can handle Arabic, Khmer, *and*
Mongolian to professional typesetting specifications.

One could be implementing a Braille device driver that uses Unicode 3.0
Braille symbol character codes for transmission, and that does not use *any*
font at all for rendering, for example.

It is also conformant to make use of Unicode chart fonts, with fixed
glyph shapes associated with fixed character codes -- as long as the
process that is doing so is doing so intentionally and is not making
bogus claims about correct visual layout of Arabic, for example. The
production of the standard itself makes such *conformant* use of a chart
font to enable the printing of the code charts.

And since no Unicode implementation is forced to interpret all Unicode
characters, it is perfectly possible to constrain one's interpreted
repertoire to some fixed small set that *can* be implemented with a
simple one-to-one character-to-glyph representation model. As long as
the Unicode text content is rendered *legibly*, in accordance with the
intended semantics of the characters, and is not "garbaged" by a
misinterpretation of the intended values of the characters, that would
have to be considered conformant.

And finally, there are plenty of "backend" processing implementations
of the Unicode Standard that have no rendering -- and that therefore
do not have to worry about the complexities of visual display.

I don't think this "if and only if" statement can hold for Unicode
implementations in general. Bitmap fonts would be hard-pressed to
deal with the minimal display requirements for many complex scripts,
but it is not beyond the realm of engineering possibility to keep
extending existing approaches. For complex scripts it just isn't worth
the effort, basically, when better approaches using "smart" outline
fonts exist.

But in any case, the requirements for legible display of a given
piece of well-formed Unicode text vary from script to script -- and
not all require the same level of sophistication that Arabic or
Mongolian do, for example.

And Marco, you can put your mind at ease. You will search long and
hard -- and in vain -- in the Unicode Standard, Version 3.0 for any
formal conformance statement that would require an implementation
to make use of a *particular* font technology -- or indeed, of any
font technology at all -- in order to be conformant to the standard.

(I assume that by now Unicoders not interested in this topic will have 
stopped following this thread, so this can be considered "on topic").

As a further salvo in the "text vs markup" skirmish on this list, I suggest 
you point your browser to the surprisingly open-minded article at 
http://www.tidbits.com/tb-issues/TidBITS-522.html#lnk3.

The technical details should be understood to most of us.  But tThe key 
point in this article is that the battle of non-standard tags in the 
"browser wars" has not only flamed out, but is being trumped by -- get this 
-- _standards_.

The drive to non-PC devices is causing a resurgence of interest in text, 
and in the separation of presentation from markup.  I would have thought 
that computer scientists would get this intuitively, but this article, 
discussions on this list, and the marketplace all show that assumption to 
be naive.

Markus' screed on the use of "ANSI" might appear to be off topic, but the 
word "Unicode" can end up being equally debased (and thus equally useless) 
if care isn't taken now.

I think this is a fair comment, if one assumes so broad a sense of
'layout'. On the other hand, I wouldn't consider a paragraph break to be
necessarily 'layout', since it is primarily a textual convention that can
be represented in layout in a myriad of different ways: double spacing,
indentation, pilcrows, etc.. Now, we have interpreted a paragraph break in
a particular way in plain text code -- a hard break and a move to a new
line, i.e. the behaviour of a typewriter 'return' key -- and have further
muddied things by using this code to force layout by, for instance,
entering two paragraph breaks

to achieve this particular layout.

Personally, I think a truly plain text paragraph break would have no
particular layout behaviour associated with it; rather, it would indicate a
textual break that would be interpreted by applications according to user
defined layout preferences. In e-mail, it is handy to have paragraphs
separated by a 'double return', especially when several correspondents are
being quoted, but elsewhere I would prefer indented, single-spaced
paragraphs. Since it is the same textual break that is being indicated, I
don't think these two layout options should be differently encoded. I think
equating a digital paragraph break with the return key on a manual
typewriter is actually a failure to encode plain text.

That said, I realise that this might be an extremist view, and I certainly
don't expect anybody to change anything now. Although I have to add, as
someone who has typeset books, that having to remove all the double returns
in a document before I can properly control the paragraph breaks is almost
as annoying as replacing multiple tabs or word spaces when these have been
used to force layout in 'plain text'. Thank goodness for macros.

The problem with the phrase "plain text" is that it is a polite 
fiction. ASCII characters, printing and non-printing, originated as 
commands to printers. What we originally called plain text files are 
those that would give reasonable results when printed on an ASCII 
teleprinter used as a terminal. The mechanical functions of Teletypes 
defined the original semantics of the control characters used in text 
files, and since carried over to screen and laser printer output--

CR Carriage Return    Move printing point to beginning of current line.
LF Line Feed          Move printing point down one line.
BS Back Space         Move printing point one space left, unless at left limit.
HT Horizontal Tab     Move printing point right to next tab stop, unless at
                         right limit.
FF Form Feed          Move printing point to top of next page.

and is the reason why many of us call CR-LF either a line or 
paragraph break today. Explicit line breaks were, of course, 
essential on the original devices. Both CR and BS were routinely used 
for overstriking.

The semantics of these and other ASCII control characters have been 
changing with technology. *Some* computer system designers, noticing 
that the demands of printing terminals were not requirements on 
system file internals, chose to use either CR alone or LF alone for 
line or paragraph ends, all without coordination. Line breaks in 
files became optional on systems that provided word wrap on output or 
display. Users were given options for setting tab stops, margins, and 
page lengths. Character 7F, DEL, originally meant "not a character; 
deleted" on punched paper tape, but began turning into destructive 
backspace even before tape died. ESC has undoubtedly mutated the 
most. The use of 1A SUB for end of file in several operating systems 
including PCDOS is a violation of the ASCII standard, which provides 
both 03 ETX (End of Text) and 04 EOT (End of Transmission), but who 
cared?

There are now numerous incompatible formats bearing the name "plain 
text". Some are distinguished by the choice of line end string. In 
some cases, line ends are required, especially if there is a maximum 
line length. Lines of unlimited length may represent paragraphs or 
database records. Character sets other than ASCII may be used, 
especially 8859-1 or Windows code page 1252. These days, people want 
to be able to use any coded character set and still call it plain 
text. In fact, people want to introduce all kinds of markup, 
including furigana/rubi, language tags, ligature marking, and even 
character set shift sequences (not just the poky SI and SO), and 
still call the result plain text.

The use of tabs, spaces, CR, and LF to lay out "plain text" is 
necessary in mail and news, and a total pain in documents that will 
need to be converted to anything else.

It is too late for such simple solutions. If we want to have a 
standard for plain text, we have to provide for each of the common 
usages. We have tried to start such a project twice on this list, and 
have failed utterly both times.

Hear, hear. I have wasted a remarkable amount of time over the years 
on reformatting Word documents into FrameMaker. The "pain text" [sic] 
markup habits of engineers are responsible for most of the work in 
those conversions. Thank goodness for book-wide search and replace in 
FM 6.

Definitely not true of the model 33; it interpreted 0A as a line-feed,
and if it received one not preceded by 0D
                                          it would do this.

How so?  The LF behavior is different from the NL behavior.

Definitely not true of any DEC OS; control characters were echoed as ^A, ^B,

Again, not true of any DEC OS; characters were interpreted one by one
and selectively echoed by the CPU only.
There were no buffering serial-line controllers for the PDP-8, and they
weren't introduced for the PDP-11 until later -- and even then, the typical
mode was to stop buffering on *any* control character.

Please do not refer to MS Word. If Unicode Consortium had not
listened to the industrial push of Micsrosoft to support
their existing  and broken  standard, we would have a much
better and  cleaner character  standard now.

I don't think a character standard should go in the arena of
typesetting  to the extent Unicode does. I think it should
provide  clean and easy character standard with presentation
forms that can  be  unambiguously put on a character based
text terminal with no fancy typesetting features. Then if
you want to typeset, go to the next level.

As for cut & paste, it might work among Microsoft Apps
but if one  wants to interface an app  with a disclosed
clipboard  format he will realize that he can not paste
unicode text that  contains '\u0000'  characters. Impossible.
And how about UCS-4 ? Forget it. As a text format it is not
even  existent.

I think it would be much better to look for another
benchmark engine. If I were Unicode Consortium I would
build one. Just to  prove that the  standard works.
Wait... maybe it does not?

Thanks for your attention, I am really bad I know :)

I am surprised and puzzled by the "Unicode 1.0 Name" changes for some of the 
ASCII and Latin-1 control characters that were introduced in the latest beta 
version of the Unicode 3.2 data file (UnicodeData-3.2.0d5.txt):

U+0009  HORIZONTAL TABULATION  ==>  CHARACTER TABULATION
U+000B  VERTICAL TABULATION  ==>  LINE TABULATION
U+001C  FILE SEPARATOR  ==>  INFORMATION SEPARATOR FOUR
U+001D  GROUP SEPARATOR  ==>  INFORMATION SEPARATOR THREE
U+001E  RECORD SEPARATOR  ==>  INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO
U+001F  UNIT SEPARATOR  ==>  INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE
U+008B  PARTIAL LINE DOWN  ==>  PARTIAL LINE FORWARD
U+008C  PARTIAL LINE UP  ==>  PARTIAL LINE BACKWARD

Were these "new" names (e.g. CHARACTER TABULATION) really the original 
Unicode 1.0 names?  I don't have my 1.0 book close at hand, but I know that 
they were *not* the names used in 1.1, according to the file "namesall.lst" 
from that version.  (Aha, didn't think anyone still had that dusty old thing 
lying around?)

IMHO, the new names CHARACTER TABULATION and LINE TABULATION are much less 
intuitive than HORIZONTAL TABULATION and VERTICAL TABULATION.  Sometimes you 
even see the abbrevations HT and VT for these two characters.  The new names 
appear to have been invented by someone who imagined a lack of clarity in the 
old names.

I have seen the names IS4, IS3, IS2, and IS1 before, but they do not convey 
the same information as FS, GS, RS, and US.  The latter names are more 
specific.

The "old" names for these six control characters were used as far back as the 
original 1963 version of ASCII, according to Mackenzie (pp. 245-247).

I don't know about the history of U+008B and U+008C, but again it seems 
strange that the "Unicode 1.0 name" for these characters is being changed at 
this late date.

I know this 1.0 name field is not subject to the same rule of "no changes, 
ever" that applies to the regular Character Name field, but why should these 
names be changed at all?

On this same topic, parenthesized abbreviations have been added to the 1.0 
names for U+000A LIFE FEED (LF), U+000C FORM FEED (FF), U+000D CARRIAGE 
RETURN (CR), and U+0085 NEXT LINE (NEL).  Does the addition of these 
abbreviations mean that they are now part of the official 1.0 name, and if 
so, why?  Other characters typically don't have abbreviations as part of 
their names, even if they are as meaningful and as commonly used as these, 
and again it is a change from the 1.0 name we have seen for a decade.

Perhaps I've been checking the beta files a bit TOO carefully.

None of the C0 and in particular C1 names are really from Unicode 1.0.
They are from ISO/IEC 6429.  Now from ISO/IEC 6429:1992 (Third edition),
rather than the second edition.  Technically the same standard is available
as Fifth edition of ECMA-48, 1991; ftp://ftp.ecma.ch/ecma-st/Ecma-048.pdf.
The earlier editions are as far as I can see no longer available. Most
of the name changes (in 1991!) were apparently done in an attempt to
internationalise that (those) standard(s). "HORIZONTAL TABULATION" would
be vertical if the lines are vertical, etc.  So these name changes DO add
clarity.  The old abbreviations were retained, however.  The mismatch
between ISO/IEC 6429:1992 and Unicode 2.x "names" for these has caused a
bit of a stir when someone was translating the names.

For the ISn-s it appears that a generalisation was desired (I don't know
if this was new in the 1991/1992 editions), with US, RS, GS, FS being
suitable only if such a hierarchy was used.  My reading is that the ISn-s
are not necessarily hierarchical.

Well, *someone* is clearly paying close attention! And the editors haven't even
officially announced the Unicode 3.2 beta period yet.

> 
> Were these "new" names (e.g. CHARACTER TABULATION) really the original 
> Unicode 1.0 names?  

No, they were not. The older names were the Unicode 1.0 names for
U+0009, U+000B, U+001C..U+001F. Unicode 1.0 didn't have *any* names
for C1 control codes.

The official UTC doctrine now is that C0/C1 control characters do not
have Unicode names, formally. But what we do is print ISO 6429 control
function names as aliases in the names list for the charts. (This
was an official decision by the UTC for Unicode 3.0, so is not just
an editorial whim.)

The mechanism that the names list generation tool currently uses for that 
is to print "<control>" in the name area and to grab the Unicode 1.0
name field for the alias (if one exists). This is special-cased code 
just for the control characters. The simplest fix for updating the
ISO 6429 names to match the actual, current 6429 standard, was simply to
update the Unicode 1.0 name field for the 8 instances you cite above.

Incidentally, in case you are worried about historic accuracy here,
the "Unicode 1.0 name" field was already fully suborned for the
Unicode 3.0 publication, since the ISO 6429 C1 function names were
inserted into that field, even though Unicode 1.0 had *no* names
at all for C1 control characters.

Kent explained the standards rationale for updating these. It is a matter
of actually using the names from the published version
of the standard we are nominally referring to.

Incidentally, take a look also at NamesList-3.2.0d3.txt in the same BETA
directory. It shows that all the older C0 names have been retained as
further aliases, since they are actually more familiar to most people,
as you are pointing out.

Yep. Venerable names. Honored names. Useful names.

Aliases, actually, from the Unicode point of view, not formal names.

And Kent explained why update the aliases.

Off and on, I work at a project to backrev from UnicodeData-1.1.5.txt
to produce a Unicode 1.0 version of UnicodeData.txt, as it would
have been defined if such a data file had been defined at the
time. (It wasn't.) If I get around to posting that, then people can
use the Unicode name field itself as the documentation of what the
Unicode 1.0 name was!

In the meantime, if you want the old time religion for the Unicode 1.0
names, you can extract them from UnicodeData-2.0.14.txt (the version
officially released with Unicode 2.0), before the field was repurposed
for the Unicode 3.0 publication.

> Perhaps I've been checking the beta files a bit TOO carefully.

I suppose we should add a note to UnicodeData.html, clarifying the
special status of the Unicode 1.0 name field for the control
characters.

Personally, I find it counter-productive to add a hodge-podge of dingbats and miscellaneous symbols to Unicode, or any coded character set.
They had practical uses when user interfaces and display systems could not handle icons and arbitrary images, but those times are long over.
Witness the demise of the DOS codepages with block graphics when graphical UIs became available.

In my personal opinion, I find that the inclusion of such symbols dimishes the credibility of Unicode as a standard and of the UTC as following reasonable principles and guidelines.

Postings on this list has recently touched the topic of using various
languages in web pages. Comments has been made of the use of embedded fonts
(eot and pfr), as well as the lack of support for these font formats in
popular browsers. This is a topic which I am very enthusiastic about, so I
can not help but to add a few comments myself. 

Let me start by posing a question: 
	"Can modern browsers show text?"
Specifically, can they show text of any language and formatting on all
platforms? I have to say; No they can not (possibly with the exception of
the browser Nophus). 

The problem with browsers today is that although they may support Unicode
encoding schemes (e.g. UTF8), they typically rely on the platform/OS they
run on to show text. Platform without complete Unicode 3.x support will thus
not be able to show text correctly. For example, IE6 (or any other modern
browser) supports UTF8 but Win98 does not support Unicode 3.x. IE6 is thus
not able to show Unicode text on Win98. You may of course be able to show
some Unicode text on some platforms. This is far from claiming that a
browser support Unicode though. At most, you may claim that a browser on a
particular platform support some part of Unicode. 

Further more, even if a browser knew how to rendered text (e.g. know about
the nitty-gritty details of glyph ordering, positioning and shaping that are
language specific), you need something called a font to show text. Fonts can
be provided as web resources through CSS 2, through a construct known as
@font-family rules. However, there are no browser that fully support CSS 2
today, and in particular @font-family rules. There are browser that support
@font-family on some platforms (e.g. for eot files on Windows). Again, this
is far from claiming that a browser support fonts on the web.

Modern browsers know how to show the characters 'A'-'Z' and a few other
characters as long as you don't expect to format the text with a specific
font. You will get into trouble as soon as you want to use a font or
characters from other languages. You may find a solution for some languages
and some fonts on some platforms. Yet again, this is far from claiming that
modern browsers can show text. (I do not consider solutions where you have
to download a 10MB+ language package to see a page in a foreign language.
It's not a viable solution.)

So what we have today are applications called "web browsers" that are very
good at showing images, and animations. They are not very good at showing
text, other than unformatted English text.

Fortunately, there are third party solutions to work around some of the
problems I mention above. Bitstreams "FontPlayer" (for pfr fonts for IE 5.x
and Nav 4.x on Windows), MS Typography's WEFT tools (for eot fonts in IE 5.x
on Windows), and our own FAIRY server solution (for eot fonts and language
support in IE 5.x, Nav 4.x, Nav 6.x and Opera 5.x on Mac and Win). 

I do admire the work that people have done in creating quite outstanding web
browsers through the years, sometimes with no other reward than peoples
appreciation. I only wish that time were spent on supporting text, and not
just flashy content.

Well, technically conformant, but not wise. If commonly available
display and rendering mechanisms are not rendering them as interlinear
annotations, then you aren't really providing much assistance here
by using a mechanism designed for internal anchors and trying to
turn it into something it isn't really up to snuff for.

Frankly, you would be much better off making use of the Ruby annotation
schemes available in markup languages, which will give you better
scoping and attribute mechanisms.

Stop worrying a moment about "Why are these characters standardized,
and why the hedoublehockeysticks can't I use them?!" and think about
the problem that furigana or any other interlinear annotation rendering
system has to address:

  a. How are the annotations adjusted? Left-adjusted, centered,
     something else? And what point(s) are they synched on?

  b. If the annotated text or the annotation itself consist of
     multiple units, are there subalignments? E.g.

           note note note          note    
           text text textextextext text

    or

           note note      note     note    
           text text textextextext text

  c. Can an annotation itself be stacked into a multiline form?

           note note note
             nononononote
           text

  d. Can the text of the annotation itself in turn be annotated?

  e. Can the text have two or more coequal annotations? And if so,
     how are they aligned?

  e. If the annotation is in a distinct style from the text it
     annotates, how is that indicated and controlled?

  f. How is line-break controlled on a line which also has an
     annotation?

And so on. This is all the kind of stuff that clearly smacks to me
of document formatting concerns and rich text. Why anyone would consider
such things to be plain text rather escapes me.

Of the hundreds of little utility programs I've written over the past 10
years or so, one of the ones I still use most often is FIXCRLF, which
(as you might expect) converts files between different CR/LF
conventions.  I have to; most text files downloaded from the Internet
are LF, but most DOS/Windows tools demand CRLF.  It's a shame, but
hardly a surprise, that the industry could never standardize on one or
the other.

The invention of U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR was supposed to relieve us of all
this misery -- but ironically, the success of UTF-8 has probably killed
LS for good.  Not only do people now expect Unicode text files to be
backward-compatible with ASCII, which favors CR and/or LF instead of LS,
but the single character LS requires more bytes in UTF-8 than the two
characters CR and LF.

You might find it very un-nice in practice, since plain text 
editors/viewers are notorious for not supporting tagging of any kind. In 
fact, all you are likely to get are a series of uninterpreted black boxes 
for the tags.

As a result of being monofont plain text viewers/editors are also notorious 
for not supporting much beyond a limited repertoire of characters [a few 
noble exceptions to this rule notwithstanding].

Unless a widely used plain-text protocol requires or supports these 
characters, they remain a solution in search of a problem. I still haven't 
seen evidence of such a protocol.

Remember, just because something's in the standard doesn't mean that it's 
magically supported everywhere. If it can't be added to existing systems by 
simple font extension (or similar updates) it may not be supported for a 
long time: Until it's widely supported, it's de-facto not available to 
end-users.

We're doing our best.  Kermit software supports Unicode in plain text
terminal sessions:

  http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/glass.html

and Linux is moving in that direction too (e.g. the Linux console in the
latest Red Hat release, as well as many Linux / GNU plain-text utilities,
now including EMACS 21.1):

  http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html

Plain-text interactive shell and application access is still a widely
used protocol, and is becoming more internationalized every day thanks to
Unicode.

We place so much demand on plain text because we use plain text.

We continue to advance from the days when plain text meant ASCII only
rendered in bitmapped monospaced monochrome.

We dont rely on mark-up or higher protocols to distinguish between different
European styles of quotation marks.  We no longer need proprietary rich-text
formats and font switching abilities to be able to display Greek and Latin
text from the same file.

Is legibility the only requirement of plain text?  Might additional 
requirements
include appropriate, correct encoding and correct display?

To illustrate a legible plain text run which displays as intended (all things 
being
equal) yet is not appropriately encoded (this e-mail is being sent as plain 
text
UTF-8):

     ...
     * 


(*   )

Clearly, correct and appropriate encoding (as well as legibility) should be a 
requirement of plain text.  Is correct display also a valid requirement for 
plain text?

It is for some...

Respectfully,
