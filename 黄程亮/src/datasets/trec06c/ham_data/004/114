Hi all:

Here's what happened at the general meeting on wed Nov6.

To start off Anuraag went over the proposed allocation of money
to the different projects.

The next topic was getting our web page updated. Niranjan volunteered
to get this done. 

Next was brochure. There was discussion about whether we need one 
and if we do what kind of a brochure would it be. The general feeling
was  we need a brochure that is cheap enough so we can hand it
people at ICMD cocerts, movies that we organize etc. This will also
be something we can give to people who want to know what asha is.
Anu will research more on how/when/what of this. Ram and Prakash will
help Anu.

POBox: We need to get a permanent address that we can advertise. Rajaram
volunteered to setting up a po box.

Recruitment and Community presence: There were some ideas thrown around
as to how we can get new volunteers.
	1. Organize a mixer. 
	2. Arrange pickups from airport for new students.
	3. Make a 'students survival guide in the triangle' or
	   some such thing which is useful to the students and which
	   mentions asha and gives some contact numbers. This insert can
	   be added to the ISO mailer to new students.
	4. Apart from the students we need to make an effort to interest
	   the professionals who work in this area.
	5. We need to get Asha-RTP registered with UNC and Duke and general
	   meetings could be rotated among the three schools. Its also better to
	   hold regular meetings at public places rather that peoples houses.
	6. Get free ads (about meetings, events) in News & Observer, Spectator,
	   Independent etc.
	7. Put posters in public places - like wellspring, restaurants etc.
	8. Organize a walk for literacy?
	9. Continue our free movies program.
	10.Organize a general picnic.
Easwar will look into new student interaction. Ram will look into putting up
asha literature at restaurants, getting local businesses to contribute on a
regular basis etc. Rajaram will work at finding a public place to meet and
publicizing meeting times. 

Calendars: The new calendars look very good. We need to get a brochure/donation
slip done and include that with the calendars. We'll have a meeting some time
soon to distribute the calendars.

Asha name and Goals: What should Asha-RTP's response to the discussion about
asha name and goals? We talked about this a lot, but there was no resolution
as to what we as Asha-RTP should put forth.

Finis. End of meeting.

Folks who were there - please add to this if I missed something

Ram.

Easwar, I think this is a great idea. My only comment is that this should
probably be combined with our plan for organizing a regular meeting. In your
Email once again, you have given phone numbers for interested people to call.
I think putting a regular meeting time/place would be very effective. 
If we can work out a room in NCSU, this may not take that long to come up
with. I will talk to about this later.

Anyway go ahead and post this now. We can update this with the meeting
time/place and post this once again later.


Ram, Thanks for the detailed meeting minutes.

Let me add some more context information to the meeting minutes. Asha has
been having very good community support whenever there is some big fund-
raiser. But for day to day operations and planning we havent been able to
get committed members. Having 100 voluteers during fund-raisers would not
be of any use if there are not those core group of volunteers who decide to
have a fund-raiser and decide on what are all the things that are required
to be done for a fund-raiser. So our thrust needs to be to get this core
group of volunteers.

Many of the initiatives we came up with during our recent meeting was towards
this question, i.e., how do we get more people to regularly come for Asha
meetings and participate in its planning and day-to-day operations?
We came up with the following initiatives,

1. Come up with a good brochure for Asha which can be distributed at
community functions/events.

2. Bring our Web page upto date. Make sure this is refered to by other Web
pages like those for Sangam, Ektaa and DIA.

3. Arrange for regular meetings at a regular place. For instance it may be
something like Asha meetings every month first Thursday at --- building in
NCSU. I noticed that just doing this will improve our attendance.
	a. This meeting will not be in a persons home. So people who do not
	   know anyone in Asha will not feel uncomfortable about attending.
	b. This will be in a regular place and time. So someone who has not
	   been attending Asha meetings regularly would not have any problem
	   knowing when / where the next meeting will be.
	c. If someone asks you when/where they should come to the next Asha
	   meeting, you will be able to give a proper answer.
	d. We can put this meeting information also in our posters. So that
	   people know where to come to to meet will get os Asha members.

4. A poster/Email/news posting campaign leading up to our first meeting to
get as many people as possible to attend this meeting. We can also announce
these meetings in N&O, Spectator etc.

5. Try and attract new Indian students. For this do the following,
	a. Send Asha flyer with the International student organisation mail to
	   new Indian student.
	b. Offer Airport pickup / initial accomodation / other help to new
	   students.
	c. Arrange a Welcome party for the new comers.

6. Organize other events to attract members of the community like mixers,
free movies, general picnic etc.

7. Participate in the Walk for Literacy of all the Asha chapters decide to
go with that.


I believe that if we start doing these right now, we can be a stronger and
more effective group by the 1997 Fall. We should try to start our regular
meetings January. We should really push to get the new students for 1997 Fall
involved with Asha. These initiatives are certainly going to involve a lot
of effort. We would need all the help from the current Asha volunteers.

Thanks to Easwar, we now have a P.O.Box. Our address is,

	Asha-RTP
	P.O. Box 5464
	Raleigh, NC 27650-5464
