             THIRD WORKSHOP ON RANDOMIZED PARALLEL COMPUTING
            __________________________________________________

                         March 30 -- April 3, 1998
                                ORLANDO, FL

                 sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society
                           Technical Committee
                          on Parallel Processing


        Randomization has played a vital role in the domains of both
        sequential and parallel computing in the past two decades.
        This workshop is a forum for bringing together both theoreticians
        and practitioners who employ randomized techniques in parallel
        computing. Topics include but are not limted to:

                .Network Algorithms
                .PRAM Algorithms
                .Architectures
                .I/O Systems
                .Scheduling
                .Network Fault Tolerance
                .Reconfigurable Networks
                .Optical Networks
                .Various Applications
                .Programming models and languages
                .Implementation Experience

        Papers of an experimental nature (describing implementation results)
        are especially sought. Authors are invited to submit previously
        unpublished original papers (that will not be submitted elsewhere)
        reflecting their current research results. All submitted papers will
        be refereed for quality and originality.

        Accepted papers will appear in the workshop proceedings to be
        published by SPRINGER-VERLAG. We expect to have many
        internationally reputed invited speakers. Invited papers and
        selected contributed papers will appear in a book to be
        published by KLUWER ACADEMIC PRESS.

        CONFIRMED INVITED TALKS (this list will grow):

        Authors are requested to send their papers (in postscript format)
        electronically to raj@cise.ufl.edu. Those who are unable to send
        electronic versions can submit six copies of their manuscripts
        to S. Rajasekaran, Dept. of CISE, 301 CSE Building, Univ. of
        Florida, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA. The due date for submissions
        is December 20. Late submissions run the risk of rejection without
        consideration of merits. Each manuscript should be of length no
        more than 12 double-spaced single sided pages using 12 point type.

        The workshop will be held in conjunction with the International
        Parallel Processing Symposium to be held from March 30 through
        April 3, 1998 in Orlando, FL.
