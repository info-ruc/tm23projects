Subject: (bad) surprise with the C compiler
Summary: non-atomic operation on structures

I was somewhat surprised when I realised that
	delta = Pt(-delta.y, delta.x)
expanded as
	delta = (Point){-delta.y, delta.x}
was actually equivalent to
	delta.x = -delta.y, delta.y = delta.x
As you can suppose, it doesn't work as intended.
