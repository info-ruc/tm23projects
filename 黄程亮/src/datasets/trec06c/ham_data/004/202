               SECOND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON

                    COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

                           (RECOMB 98)


                      March 22 - 25, 1998

                           Sponsored by

                 Association for Computing Machinery

                              SIGACT

                         with support from

                         SLOAN Foundation
                      US Department of Energy

          http://www.mssm.edu/biomath/recomb98.html


The Second Annual Conference on Research in Computational Molecular
Biology (RECOMB 98), sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery
Special Interest Group on Algorithms and Computation Theory (ACM-SIGACT)
with support from the SLOAN Foundation, and US Department of Energy will
be held in New York City, March 22 - 25, 1998. Papers reporting on
original research (both theoretical and experimental) in all areas of
computational molecular biology are sought, including surveys of important
recent results/directions. Typical but not exclusive topics of interest
include:

- Genomics
- Molecular sequence analysis
- Recognition of  genes and regulatory elements
- Molecular evolution
- Protein structure
- Combinatorial libraries and drug design


ABSTRACT SUBMISSION:
Authors are requested to send 10 copies (preferably two sided copies) of a
detailed extended abstract (5-10 pages)  to:

                        Professor Pavel Pevzner
                        RECOMB 98 Program Chair
                        University of Southern California
                        Department of Mathematics, DRB 155
                        Los Angeles, CA 90089-1113

An abstract must be received by October 20, 1997. This is a firm deadline.
Simultaneous submission to another conference or journal is allowed.


CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS:
The extended abstracts for the Conference will be published by ACM Press
and will be available at the Conference. A selection of the accepted
extended abstracts in their final journal versions will be invited to
appear in a special issue of the Journal of Computational Biology devoted
to RECOMB 98.


NOTIFICATION:
The conference submissions will be refereed by the program committee.
Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by a letter mailed on
or before December 15, 1997. A final copy of each accepted paper is
required by January 10, 1997. An author of each accepted paper is expected
to attend the Symposium and present the paper; otherwise alternative
arrangements should be made to have the paper presented.


ABSTRACT PREPARATION:
An abstract should start with a succinct statement of the problem, the
results achieved, their significance and a comparison with previous work.
This material should be understandable to nonspecialists. A technical
exposition directed to the specialist should follow. The length, excluding
cover page and bibliography, should not exceed 10 pages. The manuscript
should be easy to read, preferably using 11 point font size on U.S.
standard 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper.  If authors believe that more details are
necessary to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a
clearly marked appendix. An E-mail address for the contact author should
be included.


INVITED SPEAKERS:

Charles Cantor (Boston University)
Thomas Caskey (Merck)
David Cox (Stanford University)
Ron Davis (Stanford University)
Klaus Gubernator (CombiChem)
Joshua Lederberg (Rockfeller University)
Michael Levitt (Stanford University)
David Schwartz (New York University)
John Yates (University of Washington)


CONFERENCE EVENTS

RECOMB 98 will feature 9 invited lectures including the following conference
events:

THE STANISLAW ULAM MEMORIAL COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY ADDRESS
awarded by RECOMB to a scientist who has made major contributions
in the computational aspects of the field. Professor Joshua Lederberg
of Rockfeller University will deliver the Statislav Ulam Memorial
Computational Biology Address.

THE DISTINGUISHED BIOLOGY LECTURE
awarded by RECOMB to a scientist who has made major contributions
in the biological aspects of the field. Professor Ron Davis
of Stanford University will deliver the Distinguished Biology Lecture.

THE DISTINGUISHED NEW TECHNOLOGIES LECTURE
describing emerging, new technologies. Professor David Cox
of Stanford University will deliver the Distinguished New Technologies Lecture.


BEST PAPER BY A YOUNG SCIENTIST AWARD.
This award will be given to the best paper written solely by one or more
recent graduates or students. An abstract is eligible if all authors are
recent graduates (within 2 years from Ph.D.) or full-time students at the
time of submission. This should be indicated in the submission letter. The
program committee may decline to make the award or may split it among
several papers.
