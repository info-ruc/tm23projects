Call for Papers

ENDINGS?

The Universities of Bristol and Exeter will host a two-day postgraduate
conference to be held at Bristol University, 7-8 July 1998. Papers are
invited from all areas of French Studies. Topics suggested include:
discourse and closure, the End of History, narrative endings, fictional
deaths, teleologies, and the art of death. This list is not exclusive, and
it is hoped that the conference will engage in a variety of ways with the
specifically Francophone development of cultural atitudes to the notion of
ending. Selected papers will be published. Please send abstracts of 400
words (papers will last approximately 20 minutes) with name, affiliation,
postal and e-mail addresses by 15 February 1998 to:

ENDINGS? Conference
Department of French
