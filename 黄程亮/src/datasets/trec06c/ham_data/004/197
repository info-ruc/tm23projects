Submission policy

  Some persons asked about our policy for "multiple submissions".
  Because there are no formal proceedings for ALEX98, the policy
  is to accept also multiple submissions. The fact that the paper
  is submitted to other events must be stated clearly on the title
  page. Of course, if the paper is already submitted to (published in)
  a journal, it will not be considered for the special issue of DAM
  dedicated to the workshop.

Submission deadline

  We strongly encourage electronic submissions to speed up the
  decision process.  The strict submission deadline is ** NOVEMBER 10 **.
  Notifications will be sent by email on Dec 20.


Information for the local hotel accommodation and a preliminary list of
the invited talks have been added to the workshop URL.

We have mailed a color POSTER of ALEX98 to the major departments.
Please send your snailmail address if you would like a copy.


Best regards,

  Roberto Battiti and Alan Bertossi
