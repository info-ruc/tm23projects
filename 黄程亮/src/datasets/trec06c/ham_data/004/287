                    (Preliminary) Call for Papers

                                PAPM'98
                   Sixth International Workshop on
              PROCESS ALGEBRA AND PERFORMANCE MODELLING
                    in conjunction with CONCUR'98
                        Nice, (11)-12 September
             http://www.arena.sci.univr.it/~priami/papm98
************************************************************************

The workshop, promoted by the University of Verona, exploits the
relationship between qualitative (functional, behavioural) and
quantitative (performance, reliability) analysis of systems via
process algebras. The amount of details to be considered when
designing and developing complex systems makes the above analyses
difficult and error-prone. The use of process algebras like CCS, CSP,
pi-calculus for qualitative analysis is well-established. Their
stochastic extensions (SPA) for quantitative analysis is a growing
field as shown by the five previous editions of this workshop. The goal
of PAPM is to bring together researchers in the field of process algebra
and performance evaluation to find useful and uniform integrated
environments for designing and developing complex (distributed) systems.

********
Topics   *  include, but are not limited to
********
-Process algebra extensions for quantitative analysis (stochastic,
         probabilistic, temporal);
-Other formal models of quantitative analysis and their relations to SPA;
-Quantitative analysis of mobile systems;
-Case studies;
-Tools supporting quantitative analysis based on process algebra.
