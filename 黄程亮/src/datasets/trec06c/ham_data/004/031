        5th International Workshop on Program Comprehension

                         The Dearborn Inn
                        Dearborn, Michigan
                         May  28-30, 1997


                     =========================
                        Preliminary Program
                     =========================

Theme

Comprehending programs written by others is at the heart of various
software engineering activities. Program comprehension is performed
when one reuses, reengineers, or enhances existing (or legacy) programs.
It is also performed during review or code walk-through of new programs.

The goal of this workshop is to bring together practitioners and
researchers from government, academia, and industry to review the
current state of the art and explore solutions to the program
comprehension problem.
