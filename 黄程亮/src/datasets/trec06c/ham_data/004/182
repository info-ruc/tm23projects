OBJECTIVES

CHARME 97 is the ninth in a series of working conferences devoted to 
the
development and use of formal techniques in digital hardware design 
and
verification.  Previous meetings were held in Darmstadt (1984), 
Edinburgh
(1985), Grenoble (1986), Glasgow (1988), Leuven (1989), Torino 
(1991),
Arles (1993), and Frankfurt (1995).  This conference series is 
sponsored
by IFIP, and is organized in cooperation with IFIP WG 10.5.

Formal verification is increasingly recognized as an appropriate tool 
for
design acceptance (i.e., establishing correctness), and for detecting
design errors and specification ambiguities.  The validation of 
functional
and timing behaviour is a major bottleneck in current VLSI design 
systems.
Once an academic area, formal design and verification techniques are 
now
beginning to attract serious attention from industry.  Given this 
general
increase in activity, our aim is to bring together researchers and 
users
>From both communities.

9:15 - 10:00  Session 1.1: Invited Presentation

 ASIC/System HW verification at Nortel: A view from the trenches,
 A. Silburt (Nortel Semiconductors)
 Abstract:
  The emergence of functional verification as the largest single
component of the ASIC development cycle has come as a bit of a
surprise to the design community.  At Nortel we have had a group
focusing on the methodologies used at this stage in the design for 4
years.  Our involvement with some of the largest Nortel HW designs
has provided us with first hand experience of the challenges in
establishing confidense that ASICs will first time in a system.  This
talk will describe the scope of the problems faced in ASIC intesive
telecom systems, the methodologies currently deployed and the
emerging technologies that we are looking towards in the future to
improve our ability to handle complex hardware systems.

15:00 - 16:30 Session 1.4: Model Checking

 Invited Presentation:  Model Checking without Hardware Drivers,
 Carlos M. Roman, Gary De Palma, Robert Kurshan (Lucent Technologies, 
Inc.)
 Abstract:
   Regardless of whether a simulator or a model checker is used for
functional verification, proper capture of the design environment is
probably one of the most important steps. This step is not just
limited to the proper definition of Clock and Reset pins but, it also
includes the specification of input constraints in order to establish
a reasonable habitat for the design. However, capturing the
environment for a model checker does differ from the conventional
approach used for simulators. In this paper, we address these
fundamental differences as they are applicable to FormalCheck[Tm], an
w-automata based, model checker being comerciallized by Bell-Labs
Design Automation, a divisions of Lucent Technologies Inc.  Drivers
(input conditioners/controllers) and Monitors (output
loggers/observers) are used in the simulation environment of
virtually every design.

These Drivers and Monitors, normally implemented with
hardware surrounding the design entity, can invariably restrict the
amount of non-determinism required to activate and detect a
corner-case bug. In contrast, the level of expressiveness in
FormalCheck's language containment constructs allows for accurate and
efficient capture of design environments while eliminating the need
for sophisticated Drivers and Monitors altogether.  These language
containment constructs cover the entire spectrum from assumptions and
exclusions to eventualities thus, making the generation of safety and
fairness constraints very simple.
