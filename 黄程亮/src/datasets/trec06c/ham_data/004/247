                            GRAPH DRAWING '98

                    McGill University, Montreal, Canada

Graph Drawing '98 (GD '98) will be held at McGill University, Montreal,
Canada, August 13 - 15, 1998. The symposium is a forum for researchers,
practitioners, developers and users working on all aspects of graph drawing.

Continuing the tradition of GD '97 (Rome), GD '96 (Berkeley), GD '95
(Passau), and GD '94 (Princeton), the proceedings of GD '98 will be
published in the Springer-Verlag Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

GD '98 follows the 10th Canadian Conference on Computational Geometry,
August 10-12, 1998, held at McGill University. See
http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/cccg98.

Scope: Graph drawing studies the construction of visualizations and layouts
of abstract graphs and networks. The automatic generation of drawings of
graphs has important applications in key areas such as databases, software
engineering, VLSI, networks, and visual interfaces as well as in fields
outside computer science. The range of issues considered in graph drawing
includes algorithms, graph theory, geometry, order theory, graphic
languages, perception, applications and practical systems.

Much research in graph drawing is motivated by applications to systems for
viewing and interacting with graphs. The interaction between theoretical
advances and implemented solutions is an important part of the graph drawing
field. Results on perception and visualization issues related to diagrams
are relevant.

Call for Papers: Papers describing original research and surveys are being
sought. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

   * Algorithms, models, and techniques for drawing graphs.
   * Applications of graph drawing to areas such as software visualization,
     user interface design and database query formulation.
   * Concepts for visualizations of structural information.
   * Research on perception issues related to diagram understanding.
   * Tools and systems for graph drawing.
   * Geometric and topological graph theory.

Call for Demos: Submissions of demos are solicited. Areas of interest
include, but are not limited to:

   * Visualization of graphs.
   * Novel graph-based software visualization and software engineering
     applications.
   * Database visualization with graphs and hypergraphs.
   * Programming environments for graphs and their layouts.
   * Algorithm animation with graphs.
   * User interfaces for viewing graphs, e.g., interactive exploration of
     large graphs, presentation of dynamic graphs.

Call for Posters: Submissions of posters in graph drawing and related areas
are solicited. The purpose is to provide a forum for the communication of
results (which may appear elsewhere) to the graph drawing community.

Graph Drawing Contest: Following the tradition of previous conferences, a
graph drawing contest will be held. Details will be given in a later call
for papers and at the web site.

Special Issue: A special issue of the electronic Journal of Graph Algorithms
and Applications will be devoted to papers presented at GD '98. Both
theoretical and applied papers that in electronic form contain interactive
appendices with running demos or proof animations or hyperlinks to useful
references are encouraged. Details will be given in a later call for papers
and at the web site.

dumps, a list of hardware needed, and optional 7 copies of VHS NTSC videos),
and posters (1 page abstract). Submissions by email (in postscript or plain

electronic submission process will be made available at the above web site.
