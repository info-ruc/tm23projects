following rsc, I did this:
aux/listen tcp il
result: could login as none , but not as a usr. Prompt was cpu%
above command was followed by:
aux/listen -t /bin/service
result: could login as none but not as a usr. Could read other usr files,
        but not write them. Prompt was cpu%

thanks to messrs Cox, Forsyth, and Hemminger
ps:
my p9 is cd version on 386
