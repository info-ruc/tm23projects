The fall issue of FEMINIST STUDIES (23.3) is in the mail!

This last issue of our twenty-fifth anniversary year
features two clusters of articles: NATION AND RACE,
SEX AND WORK and GENDER AND SEXUAL IDENTITY IN THE PUBLIC
SPHERE.

NATION AND RACE, SEX AND WORK includes studies which explore
Politics of Prostitution in Ponce, Puerto Rico, 1890-1900;
White Women and Colonialism in Nineteenth-Century British
Columbia; Gender, Family, and Working Class Politics in
India; and Gendered Meanings Under Production in Mexico's
Export Processing Industry.

Our second cluster of articles,  GENDER AND SEXUAL
IDENTITY IN THE PUBLIC SPHERE, explore the International
Women's Movement in the Early Twentieth Century; the
politics of the production of knowledge about breast
cancer; a review essay that exposes the myth of the rich
gay community; and an art essay that examines issues of
sexuality and identity in relation to aging.

And, as in every issue, FEMINIST STUDIES brings both new
and familiar creative voices to our readers.

Stop by our website for the complete table of content for
the issue. www.inform.umd.edu/FemStud

Our plans for the next publishing year promise to be
equally exciting. Our spring issue begins with a cluster of
articles that look at feminism, activism, and the recent
cuts to welfare; our summer issue is devoted exclusively to
issues-- theoretical, practical, and pedagogical--
surrounding doctoral programs in women's studies; and in
the fall, we end the year with a cluster of articles that
examine masculinities.

Subscriptions per volume year are $30.00 for individuals and
$85.00 for institutions. We also offer a student rate of
$20.00 per year (a photocopy of a dated proof of student
status is required in order to receive this rate.) Single
issues are $12.00 each.

It's wonderful to learn of the tools others of you have developed for
helping students to build critical thinking skills, a project I think
should stand at the heart of undergraduate education.  I use written
assignments I have variously called "Discussion Summaries" and, more
recently, "Argument Notes."  (The change in name reflects my attempt to get
students to focus more closely on analyzing arguments with minimal
descriptive summarizing.)  I've had increasingly good results using this
tool, even though students may, initially, be rather dismayed by the amount
of work involved.  Here are the guidelines I hand out the first day of
class along with the syllabus:

Guidelines for Argument Notes

    Argument Notes are short analytical summaries of the assigned
readings for one class meeting and are due each week the class meets.  They
should be typed, with 1" (or more) margins on all sides.  Students should
aim for making their Notes 350 words in length; the absolute upper limit on
word number is 500 words.  These analytical  summaries are not meant to be
exhaustive.  Students should aim in their Argument Notes to demonstrate
their understanding of the more important arguments the author(s) is (are)
making in the day's assigned readings.  Argument Notes are intended (1) to
help students prepare for in-class discussion of the readings assigned for
the day; (2) to help students develop critical thinking skills (by
identifying arguments, engaging with arguments, and integrating arguments
across readings); and (3) to help students improve their writing skills
(clarity of presentation, conciseness, etc.).

    Argument Notes consist of three sections, which should be clearly
identified on the Notes students hand in:
    (1) Summary:  Identify and summarize three to four of the key
arguments or main points of the day's assigned readings.  Ask yourself what
the author is trying to convince you of and how.  This section should not
be descriptive; it should be analytical.  It is also not meant to be
exhaustive:  pick out three or four of the more important key arguments or
main points of the readings, and briefly map them, i.e., elaborate their
supporting claims; detail how the argument(s) "work."  (The summary section
is the most important section of your Argument Notes and should be give the
most space and attention.)
    (2) Integration:  Pick one or two ways in which the author's
arguments or the assigned reading  more generally relate to other course
readings, films/videos, in-class discussions, or other cross-cultural
materials with which you are familiar, and elaborate on these connections.
How, for example, do the day's readings challenge, complement, complicate
or in some other way relate to other readings, in-class discussions or
extra-class materials?  Look for points of similarity or difference, and
generate connections, contrasts or comparisons between them.
    (3)  Questions/Reactions:  Identify questions the readings raise
for you that we could discuss in class or in study sections.  If you are
having difficulties with a particular reading assign=1Fment, this is the
place to put your specific questions about which parts of the reading did
not make sense.
    In addition, this is the section in which you can raise objections
(to content, style, politics, methods, etc.), agreement, accolades, or any
other reactions you have to a reading.  If you have strong reactions to the
reading(s), in other words, the Questions/Reactions section, and no other
section of the Argument Notes, is the appropriate place in which to voice
them.  (Note:  Students should not, then,  include your reactions to
readings in the Summary and/or Integration sections of the Argument Notes:
those sections are analytical places where students are expected to tease
out an author's arguments, a necessary step preliminary to and separable
from evaluating an author's arguments.)

    Argument Notes are due on the day the readings are slated for class
discussion (as listed on the Course Schedule) and will not be accepted
late.  Each student is responsible for handing in Argument Notes on one
day's readings per week (to be turned in during class the day the readings
are slated for discussion), although each student chooses the day, each
week, for which s/he wants to write and hand in Argument Notes.  Notes are
due once per week each week the class meets, except for the first and last
weeks of class when no Notes are due.
    Notes will be graded as either =88 or =88- for the first four weeks
students turn them on; from then on Argument Notes will be graded. A =88
indicates the Notes effectively analyze arguments; a =88- is a red flag
indicating the Notes do not adquately analyze arguments and students should
meet with the instructor or TAs for further guidance on what arguments are
and how one goes about mapping them.  Argument Notes are worth 40% of each
student's final grade for the course.

I am teaching a business communications class in an MBA program.  Each
time I comment on avoiding the generic "he" or changing words like
Chairman to Chair I get some flack from one or two.

Today, one man insisted that these tre;nds may be true in "my field" --
english humanities women's studies -- but in business writing it's just
not done.  He asserted you would not find attention to gender neutral
langauge in business journals. I find that hard to believe and will check
in the library for submission guidelines over the weekend.

Meanwhile,
anyone out there familiar with writers/submission guidlines used by
journals in business or technical fields?  Comments on trends?

See the classic OF WOMAN BORN by Adrienne Rich.
Also, THE WOMAN IN THE BODY by Emily Martin has a good section on
birthing and midwifery.

OK, thanks for clarifying.  Now I understand the nature of your concern,
which I did not from your earlier note.  You are recommending that
participants on WMST-L not describe people in terms of personality traits
but instead be behaviorally specific.  In a general sense (as a fellow
psychologist), I agree with you, but I suspect that many participants on
WMST-L, coming from other disciplines, are not convinced of the merits of
behaviorism.

Hmmm.  I suppose it might be true that many people (e.g., essentialists)
who make heavy use of trait descriptions are in fact assuming a biological
rather than a social or cultural cause.  And so if this is true, perhaps I
did "invite" that interpretation, by not warning against it.  [I tried to
warn against it, by saying in my first note that I didn't want to get into
a discussion of heredity vs. environment, nature vs. nurture.]  Just for
the record:  _I_ don't believe that a trait description necessarily
commits one to a biological interpretation.  An individual might display a
particular trait (if we are going to discuss traits rather than behaviors)
because he or she has been socialized to do so.  I'm sorry if my original
note invited an interpretation that I didn't intend, or permitted an
inference that I didn't intend.

Wow!  Beatrice, I do feel punished for trying to initiate and maintain a
diologue here.  You seem to be saying that because I "argued against
biologistic interpretations" therefore I am accepting the "position that
there is an inescapable biological program."  How could this be?  Are you
suggesting that even recognizing or acknowledging a position that one
disagrees with amounts to agreeing with the position?  And so the only
valid response is to ignore and not acknowledge a position that one
disagrees with?

True.  Mainstream psychologists believe this.  I also believe this.

True--the part about this being popular.

Not true, about the 20% being a constant.  As variability in the
environment decreases, the variance due to heredity will increase; as
variability in the environment increases, the variance due to heredity
will decrease.  So these percentages are, in most discussions, useless.

I'm not going to respond to this paragraph--I'm not quite sure what it
refers to.  That is, I would have to make some major inferences in order
to discuss it.

More important, I would like to make clear that I do not believe in the
20%/80% partialing out of variance.  I believe that this is an
inappropriate model for understanding heredity and environment,
incorporated into the social sciences from agricultural studies.  In
general, I do not participate in such discussions, because I do not buy
into any assumptions of the model (such as that the only two choices are
heredity and environment).  If forced to use the model, I would answer
that behaviors are caused 100% by heredity and 100% by environment.  And
so I don't want to be identified with "mainstream" psychologists.  Indeed,
Beatrice, you are likely more mainstream than I, in framing the discussion
in these terms.  (Yes, we've probably reached a new low in name-calling!)

For one of my recent attacks on mainstream psychology, see:  Meacham, J.
(1996).  Not MY developmental psychology!  Contemporary Psychology, 41(4),
334-336.

I've tried to say it clearly in three messages now.  I DO believe that
biology is important.  I don't believe that this makes me a biological
determinist.  I also believe that culture is important.  I also believe
that the choices and actions of individuals are important.  I don't like
the implication that I am merely a biological determinist.

OK.  Personally, I also need to balance that with respect for the students
as individuals.  I need to understand their perspective on the issues in
the course (and in society) and not assume that my perspective is
necessarily the correct one or the one that they should adopt.

 In recommending a program of study, I was indicating  that you

OK, I probably agree with this.  For more on the role of instructors with
respect to students' behavior and understanding in the classroom, see, for
example:

Meacham, J.  (1995).  Conflict in multicultural classes:  Too much heat or
too little?  Liberal Education, 81(4), 24-29.

Meacham, J. (1996).  Interdisciplinary and teaching perspectives on
multiculturalism and diversity.  American Behavioral Scientist, 40(2),
112-122.

I'd be willing to discuss and defend what I have written there.

Brigitte Jordan's book BIRTH IN FOUR CULTURES originally published in
1978 and reissued in 1993 (Waveland Press) offers an interesting
comparative study of midwifery and birth from an anthropological
perspective.  In addition, a recent issue of Medical Anthropology
Quarterly Vol. 10 no. 2 June 1996 has a number of articles on this issue.

        Only people whom the LISTSERV software recognizes as subscribers
can post messages on WMST-L.  To subscribe, send the following message to
LISTSERV@UMDD (Bitnet) or LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU (Internet): SUB WMST-L Your
Name  (e.g., SUB WMST-L Jane Smith).  You will receive a response asking
you to confirm your subscription request by replying to the response (use
the "reply" feature; do not "forward" or start a new message).  Your reply
should not include anything but the expression OK (caps or lower case--it
makes no difference).  After you send back the reply, you should quickly
receive a message welcoming you to WMST-L.

        If you've already subscribed to WMST-L and you run into problems,
chances are that you subscribed under a different address than the one from
which you sent your recent message--e.g., you subscribed under the address
jdoe@mail.ucla.edu and now your institution has shortened your address to
jdoe@ucla.edu .  The LISTSERV software recognizes subscribers by their
e-mail address.  If your address undergoes a change, Listserv will no
longer recognize you, even if you're still able to  receive mail sent to
your old address.  If the LISTSERV software doesn't recognize your address,
you will be unable to post messages, stop mail, unsubscribe, etc.  If you
can still send mail from the address under which you subscribed, please do
so.  If you can no longer do so, contact me PRIVATELY (not via a message to
WMST-L).

        B)  Postings from all new subscribers (and old subscribers with new
subscriptions) are now automatically sent to the listowner for approval.
This cuts down on inappropriate messages from newcomers who haven't had
time to read the welcome letter.   After a few weeks, most subscriptions
are quietly readjusted so that messages are no longer subject to prior
review.

Subject:      WOMEN'S STUDIES QUARTERLY AND WIRING PROBLEMS
Content-type: text/plain; charset=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7bit

I want to apologize to the list: I've been waiting for several months to
announce the 25th Anniversary issue of Women's Studies Quarterly, even though
I've known from the mail that comes and goes across this list, that it would
answer a great many questions that keep coming up.  I've waited because The
Feminist Press has been trying to get its WEB up and running since last
December.  We finally moved in late July, unfortunately into a landmark
building on the City College campus with very poor wiring.  We are still
having problems, but we hope to solve them by January (still more bad wires in
the building!).
    So I am simply going to say that the 25th Anniversary Issue of WSQ, edited
by the late Elaine Hedges and Dorothy Helly, recapitulates the history of
Women's Studies by printing 400 pages of material from the issues beginning in
1972, including early reports from Programs all over the country, as well as
the history of the NWSA, begun in the pages of WSQ, and then from WSQ's
subscriber base, as WSQ committed itself to helping the organization to get
established.
     In addition to this history, the issue includes a long essay by Judith
Allan that is critical of current trends; a shorter essay by Ann B. Shteir on
graduate programs; a long essay by Florence Howe on trends and problems
worldwide; and an Introduction by Hedges and Helly.  It's over 500 pages and
worth $18.00.  Or for $30.00 you can subscribe for 1997 and get the issue
about to appear: Teaching African Literatures in a Global Literary Economy,
edited by Tuzyline Jita Allan.
      Your other option is to take a three-year sub for $70.00.  Next year,
the two issues are: Working Class Studies, edited by Renny Christopher, Lisa
Orr, and Linda Strom; and Internationalizing the Curriculum, edited by Deborah
Rosenfelt.  Janet Zandy of the Rochester Institute of Technology is now the
Editor of the WSQ, and in 1999, the two issue scheduled are Women and the
Environment; and Women, Science, and Technology.  So the three-year sub is a
bargain. Institutional rates are $40 for one year; $100 for three years.
        When we get onto the Web, I'll let you know at once.  We will have a
special section devoted to THE WOMEN'S GUIDE TO THE WIRED WORLD, edited by
Shana Penn, also just out.

Hello All,
I am writing for a colleague who is not on the list.  Here is her inquiry:

>considering using it in my gender course next semester but I am curious to

Let me add that our students are predominantly upper-middle-class white
18-22 year olds.  Most of the students in this class (an Anthropology of
Gender course) will be women, and many of them will be sorority members.

Responses may be sent directly to my colleague, Debbie Fiedler, at
dfiedler@gettysburg.edu.  Or you may send them to me and I will forward them
to her; or you may post them to the list if you think they are of more
general interest.

Thanks for your help.

Does anyone know of a good article on Wilkie Collins The Law and the Lady.
I am particularly interested in articles that discuss gender codes and the
masculine gaze, identity, and subjectivity.

With reference to Ehrenreich and English's book on midwives and witches,
historians (including women's and gender historians) agree that the is
no firm evidence that midwives were singled out in the European witch
hunt, so its thesis needs to be nuanced.  There is a wealth of scholarship
on the witch hunt itself.
You might look at Jessica Mitford, The American Way of Birth (Penguin,
1992) for a recent history of midwifery in the US.

I don't know about the journals, but just about every tech-writing book
I've looked at in the past few years now has a section on gender-neutral
language.  They may not yet all believe it's important in and of itself,
but the threat of sexual harassment lawsuits is enough to have it included
in the advice to newly-professional writers.  If it's not changed yet (and
now you've got me itching to go open up a couple of business journals even
though they're not my field!), change seems to be coming along.

        I recently added a site called Under Shekhina's Wings: Cross-Cultural
Women's Spirituality (http://www.geocities.com/Athens/1501/ ) to my
Women's Studies/Women's Issues Resource Sites page
(http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/links.html ).  I think Under Shekhina's Wings may
be a good place to start--it offers a number of links to related sites.

As someone who's been in the business (specifically software) world for
the last two decades, I've been quite aware of gender neutral language
and find it generally accepted (though often awkward and unfamiliar)
among writers.

In technical writing I've tried to balance he's, she's, his/hers, etc.
while scrupulously avoiding "they/their" as a pronoun with any singular
antecedent.  Where possible I use plural subjects so as to avoid the
difficulty of singular pronouns.  In fact, so familiar is this practice
by now that the use of "he" or "men" in older writing distinctly calls
attention to itself.

Aside from my own practice, I find gender-neutral writing practically if
not actually a standard for technical documentation, and Microsoft's
style manual, a quasi-bible on writing for audiences in the computer
industry, has a long section on gender-neutral writing practices.

Relating to Shelley's message below, is Shelley saying that it is illegal
(as opposed to unpopular) to use gendered language? I can't quite
imagine how such a lawsuit could be framed. Would it be part of a
"hostile environment" claim? Do people on this list feel that's an
appropriate use of sexual harassment law?

Peggy Sanday has also written a book on societies that have no rape at
all; it's a very interesting and important book, and looking through a

AnnLouise, two sites that have sections on women's spirituality are yOni
(http://www.yoni.com/) and Wise Women of the Web
(http//www.neosoft.com/~acoustic/www.html).

Also, two sites I don't have the URLs for--SisterSite, which is concerned
with women's religious congregations (they're an outgrowth of sister-list:
sister-l@listserv.syr.edu) and COGWEB (Covenant of the Goddess), an
organization of Wicca congregations (the site owner's address is

Actually, "singular they and their" is a perfectly clear and valid
construction with a long historical tradition in English literature.
For examples and documentation, see, e.g., "The singular "their" in
Jane Austen and elsewhere: Anti-pedantry page" at:

Ditto for me.  I can't think of any authority that would support a sexual
harassment claim based on gendered language.  And I'm not sure I would
want it to.  Even cases involving sexualized language (some of it very
foul) can be problematic, and courts struggle with them and end up all
over the map.

One place where Sanday's cross-cultural rape can be found is:

Sanday, P. R. (1981). The socio-cultural context of rape: A cross-cultural
study.     Journal of Social Issues, 37, 5-27.

An important critique of Sanday can be found in:

Rozee, P. D. (1993) Forbidden or forgiven? Rape in cross-cultural
perspective. Psychology of Women Quarterly, 17, 499-514.

Today's monthly excerpt from the WMST-L User's Guide:

                    ******************

     5)  "I'M GOING ON VACATION FOR SEVERAL WEEKS.  CAN I STOP MAIL WHILE
I'M AWAY, OR DO I HAVE TO UNSUBSCRIBE?"

        You can stop mail temporarily (except for the edited digest) by
sending the following message to LISTSERV@UMDD (if you subscribed on
Bitnet) or LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU (if you subscribed on Internet):

               SET WMST-L NOMAIL        [NOTE: NOMAIL is one word]

     When you want mail to start arriving again, send the following
message to the same address:   SET WMST-L MAIL

        If you want to stop the edited DIGEST, even temporarily, you have
to send the message AFD DEL WMST-L PACKAGE WMST-L  .  To re-start it, send
the message  AFD ADD WMST-L PACKAGE  (and ignore the request that you
establish a password).

        Note:  BE SURE TO SEND THESE MESSAGES TO LISTSERV, NOT TO WMST-L!
Also, if you receive a message back telling you you're not a subscriber,
see section 4) [posted yesterday].

This is a message from the December 6 Fund of Toronto, slightly edited by

On December 6, 1989, 14 women were murdered in Montreal: Annie
St-Arneault, Maryse Laganiere, Genevieve Bergeron, Barbara Daigneault,
Helene Colgan, Maryse Leclair, Barbara Klucznik, Annie Turcotte,
Anne-Marie Edward, Nathalie Croteau, Maud Haviernick, Michele Richard,
Sonia Pelletier and Anne-Marie Lemay.
Women of every race and class are abused and killed.  We mourn, and work
and study for knowledge of the causes and effects of violence.

hello. i am seeking assistance...
    today is december sixth and i am at home instead of participating
in the planned events on my campus. i am doing so because i am angry. i am
writing to ask if my anger is valid in anyone elses eyes...
    this year, it was decided by someone at trent that the "white
ribbon campaign" was going to be "more inclusive." by this, it is meant
that women are buying and wearing white ribbons. i have always thought
that the purpose of the white ribbon campaign was for men to take
responsiblilty for men's violence against women. the white ribbon says to
me, "i am a man and i am against men's violence against women." for me to
see women wearing this ribbon, i am getting two messages:
    1. women are carrying the financial burden of paying out money
that they may not have thinking that they are making a positive political,
anti-violence statement.
    2. the responsibilty for ending violence is being placed back on
women.

    violence...ending violence is not the responsiblity of one sex,
but i am feeling really angry and ...discouraged that this has happened.
am i over reacting?
    i am planning to write a letter in the first edition of the school
paper after the holidays to respond to what has made me so upset. i was
wondering if i could have some feedback on this issue...
    first i mourn...now i want to DO something.
    thanks for your time,
    kira mccarthy, a woman who wont be silenced...

I have found it useful, during the first two or three weeks
to get students to write a short (500 - 1,000 word)
autobiography (not assessed) in which I ask them to reflect
upon the ways in which being female or male  has affected
their life choices so far, and to highlight the effect they
gender has had. They can choose to hand this in for comments
or not, whicheverthey prefer, and we then use it as a basis
for a discussion about gender expectations and as a way of
picking up on common gender biases etc. Of course, I have to
do it as well.

I find this works in a number of ways, not just in making
students think about various gender issues, but also it helps
for people to discover common ground, to build a kind of
group awareness and also helps in forming relationships with
and within the group. We can then use this material later
when talking about various aspects of WS and the difference
between theory and actuality.

Several 15th-century witch hunt tracts, including the very influential
_Malleus Maleficarum_, target midwives as likely witches. An earlier tract,
_Le Vauderie de Lyonais en Brief_, (1460) charges midwives with diabolist
murders:

"Vaudois [this term had come to mean 'witch'] midwives kill infants. They
gather herbs, at certain times and with certain conjurations, with which
they work evil; they also have ointments for this purpose..." [source:
Henry Charles Lea, Materials Toward A Study of Witchcraft]

These accusations were part of an attack on midwives and healers (vide St
Bernardino's accusations that folk healers killed babies) who still
practiced herbal magic and incantations. A concerted offensive by the
clergy in the 1400s sowed suspicion of midwives and witch healers among the
populace, and yielded a wave of accusations in the 1500s and beyond. (For
many centuries, the clergy had levelled the charge of infanticide at women
who used herbal contraceptives, abortifacients, knots and incantations for
birth control, in the early medieval penitential books.)

There are many documented cases in the 1500s of midwives tried for
witchcraft, and quite a bit of evidence that they were viewed as having
supernatural powers or connections (negatively, as in the Swiss hunts, or
positively, as recent Bulgarian folklore demonstrates for a region free of
witch hunting).

I discuss this subject in greater depth in my slide presentation, "Witch Hunts."

Max,
Thanks for this information. I have written a deviance text that deals
with historical theories of deviance, and I teach about the witchcraft
craze as moral panic. I suppose part of the problem with "who" the witches
were was that this changed over time and place to focus on different
issues.

Its my understanding that by the 1600s, midwives had been targetted for
more than two centuries , and other groups were added right up till the
1700s.

I'd like to know more about your slide show!

Let me clarify: I believe that the perceived threat of sexual harassment
lawsuits has wrought changes in the corporate world that, rightly or
wrongly, go way beyond response to the strict legal interpretations.  At
least that's what my students perceive, and what corporate-world friends
tell me.  I'm sad that simple changes such as using inclusive language have
had to come as a result of fear (and have had to come so reluctantly in
some places), sad that they get framed as a "PC-police" action.  But
there's no denying that concern over the fine legal lines of appropriate
mixed-gender interactions in the workplace has spurred a variety of policy
changes.  Perhaps an acceptance of gender-neutral language would have
proceeded as quickly even without the (over)generalized legal concerns; I'd
sure like to think so....

MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Today's monthly excerpt from the WMST-L User's Guide:

     6)  "DOES WMST-L EXIST IN A DIGEST FORMAT?"

        Yes.  If you choose the edited digest option, each day you will
receive anywhere from one to five files containing most of the WMST-L
messages of the past day (messages that should not have been sent to the
list to begin with are omitted).  Related messages will usually be put in
the same file, and each file will begin with a table of contents.  The
digest reduces both mail clutter and, usually, mail volume.  (Please note
that this is NOT the huge, unselective bundle of messages that many
listserv digest features provide.  Do NOT use their digest command.)

        If you would like to receive the edited digest rather than
individual mail messages, you should first subscribe to WMST-L (if you
don't already have a subscription) by sending the message SUBSCRIBE WMST-L
Your Name to LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU. You will be asked to confirm your
subscription request.  Once you've done that and have received the list's
welcome letter, you should send the following 2-line e-mail message to
LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU:

        AFD ADD WMST-L PACKAGE
         SET WMST-L NOMAIL ACK

        Note:  If your mail system also has a Bitnet connection, the digest
may arrive as a file rather than as an e-mail message.  If you don't know
how to receive a file, see section 11 of the WMST-L User's Guide or ask the
computer support people at your institution.  If you'd prefer to receive
the digest(s) inside mail message(s), alter the abovementioned AFD ADD
statement to read as follows:  AFD ADD WMST-L PACKAGE F=MAIL .  However,
even if you receive the digest(s) as mail messages, YOU CANNOT REPLY
AUTOMATICALLY!  If you wish to reply to a message in the digest, you must
start a new message and address it either to WMST-L or to the
individual.  Also, LISTSERV may ask you to set up an AFD password.
You're best off not doing so.

        If at some point you decide you want to stop the digest and switch
back to receiving individual messages, send the following two-line message
to LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU: AFD DEL WMST-L PACKAGE WMST-L [on line 1] and SET
WMST-L MAIL NOACK [on line 2].  To unsubscribe and stop the digest, put AFD
DEL WMST-L PACKAGE WMST-L on line 1 and UNSUB WMST-L on line 2.

The OERI Visiting Scholars Program To Choose Fellows

The Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI) is the office of
the U.S. Department of Education that provides national leadership for
educational research and statistics.  The office funds education research,
demonstration, and school improvement programs; collects and analyzes
statistics; reports on the condition of education; and disseminates
information about education programs.  OERI is pleased to announce the
first OERI Visiting Scholars Program since OERI's reorganization in 1994.

The OERI Visiting Scholars Program seeks Fellows to assume a 9 to 18-month
residency in Washington, D.C. at one of the five National Research
Institutes that are a part of OERI.

On behalf of OERI, the National Research Council (NRC) will conduct a
national competition to award fellowships for each of the five institutes
to scholars, researchers, policymakers, education practitioners,
librarians, or statisticians who are engaged in the use, collection, and
dissemination of information about education and educational research.
Application forms are available from the NRC.  Application forms must be
mailed to the NRC's Fellowship Office in an envelope postmarked no later
than January 5, 1998.  The awards will be made in April 1998 to those
individuals who show the greatest promise for contributing to the
designated institute and future achievement in educational research.
Fellows can begin their residency at OERI as early as June 1998 or as late
as January 1999.

It changed, and yet there were certain constants, not least of them the
accusation of  common women. (References to serf women being burned as
"mascae" are found in the 7th-century Lex Rotharii, north Italy, while
17th-century observers were still describing the primary victims of hunts
as poor old women.) Another constant would be the association of "witch"
and "whore," a pair of epithets that were being hurled at women as early as
the 9th century (see the laws of king Alfred) and still in use a thousand
years later.

There were many other variables, of course, and you're right, use of the
sorcery charge shifted in different times and regions. For example, from
about 1300 to 1460 French and English aristocrats retooled the charge for
use as a weapon in court intrigues and power struggles. But even in these
cases, it was often common women who were burned as witches (after being
tortured or threatened into testifying that the targeted
noble/bishop/courtier had hired her to perform sorcery on the king, or
whoever).

The targeting of old women began to increase dramatically around the
mid-1400s and was a major feature of nearly all hunts after that. During
the height of the craze, a cyclic pattern emerged: it began with trials of
(primarily) poor old women; the circle widened as they were tortured into
naming other "witches," gradually including people of other classes, ages,
including men; when the proportion of men and the propertied reached a
critical mass, the craze short-circuited, only to repeat itself a decade or
a generation later.

"Deviance" from the established order is definitely a big issue in the
hunts, whether it's a late 15th-century claim that witches were rebellious
peasants, or another charge (from the same era) that they were rebellious
women. A number of early modern witch judges who spared accused women set
conditions that they stay at home, under male supervision. Reacting to
verbal or other abuse in kind was one of the most common triggers of a
witch trial, as was female mouthing off in general. It was, after all, the
era of the "witch's bridle."

The trial records are loaded with sexual politics, including the fact that
a large number of accused _men_  were related to women who had been
accused/tried/burned. Trials in 14th century France and Italy show witches
tried for helping deserted or battered women, and in 17th century Italy, a
number of battered women were tried as witches, some denounced by their
batterers. Accusations of love magic, impotence magic, birth control magic
figure in witch trials generally. Spanish Inquisition records of witch
trials show women attempting to gain control in their relations with men,
which were, of course, heavily weighted against them by law and custom.
These inquisitors also persecuted women who passed as men, such as Elvira
de Cespedes in the late 1500s. Records show that gays and lesbians were
among those burned at the stake in western Europe.

Although assertions that witches acted as healers have been in bad odor
with orthodox scholars in this century, trial records (particularly in
Italy) show many instances of practicing herbalists denounced to the
Inquisition, or to secular courts in northern Europe. This is not to say
that they were the majority of those tried, but it is clear that one
function of the hunts was to criminalize a matrix of residual female
professions including herbalism, midwifery, incantation, blessing,
counseling, divination and protective magic.

Recent European scholarship has turned the corner on the controversy over
pagan elements in folk witchcraft (a taboo subject for most of this century
for anyone who wanted to be considered a serious scholar) and is busy
examining the rich lode of folklore references in the trial records
themselves. (Carlo Ginsburg, Gustav Henningsen, Giuseppe Bonomo, Carlo
Bondi, Gabor Klaniczay, Eva Pocs, Bengt Ankarloo, Tekla Domotor, Angel Gari
Lacruz, are among them; as well as the South Americans Laura de Mello e
Souza and Carlos Contramaestre)

Gina, Of course, I consider cultural ideology and social learning early and
later in life as part of context. I think it's also important to recognize
that many people get mixed messages along the way; hegemonies are not
perfect, how they work and don't work is interesting to study. I used
social context in opposition to biology trying to be brief in an email
message.  What you're suggesting seems to me an analysis of social context,
rightly so.

>You have  a right to be angry.  For the past ten years it has been almost
impossible to limit something to one sex, for whatever reason.  When I was
guest lecturing ten years ago, trying to get a class to talk about "Not a
Love Story, even though the class was overwhelmingly female, only males
spoke.  I said I wouldn't call another man until I heard from a woman.  The
class was furious with me.  It's what lawyers call Formal Equality or gender
neutrality, in a world where the genders are treated very differently, with
one subordinated, us.
I became so angry I couldn't study violence against women any more, and
recently decided I wouldn't teach undergraduates, tenchically wouldn't teach
college age students, the older women were fine, because it is so
discouraging.  And men can mess up women's studies classes at will.
Keep up the fight!

>While I very much admire Sanday's book on fraternity rape, grounded as it
is in the lived experience of a woman at her university, there are serious
questions about the validity of her analysis of rape cross culturally.  The
data of necessity or second hand and usually from male leaders.  I remeber
one society that she scored as not having rape was based on the statement of
a leader who said"There is no rape in our society.  our women never resist".
I would stake my reputation  that there is rape in that society.  I'm not
sure she says there is NO rape-I think she was talking about more and less
rape but perhaps I am forgetting how extreme her position is.  I would go
with Rae L. Blumbergs cross cultural material in which she speaks of women's
power, which is almost completely dependent on their economic power.  They
have to control the money they make (or the goods they receive for their
labor)  and not be easily replaceable.  Additionally matrilocal rsidence
helps.  These factors are assoicated with lack of wife beating, forced
marriage, abortion, rape, reproduction control etc.I'm not sure what the
best reference is but y ou can check her in the library, since she has
written extensively. In a study I conducted I found very few societies with
no rape, but my research was not as extensive as either Sanday or Blumberg.

Subject:      if mail stops unexpectedly (User's Guide)
MIME-version: 1.0
Content-type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

Today's monthly excerpt from the WMST-L User's Guide:

     7)  "WHAT SHOULD I DO IF MAIL FROM WMST-L SUDDENLY STOPS?"

        Note: if you've arranged to receive WMST-L in edited digest form,
skip to section C below.  Otherwise, read on.

        A) If you receive a message from LISTSERV informing you that your
WMST-L options have been set to NOMAIL, that means that mail from the list
was repeatedly returned as undeliverable, probably because of a mail
problem on your system.  The fact that LISTSERV's notification reached you
indicates that the problem was probably short-lived and is now resolved.
You can set yourself back to MAIL by sending the message SET WMST-L MAIL to
LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU (or LISTSERV@UMDD for the few people who are still
subscribed under a Bitnet address).

        B)  If you haven't received a notification, but you also haven't
received WMST-L mail for a day, send the following two-word message to
LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU (or LISTSERV@UMDD if you are still subscribed under a
Bitnet address):   QUERY WMST-L

        If your message is successful, you should get back a message from
LISTSERV telling you how your "options" are set.  The key part will look
something like this:

> > query wmst-l
> Subscription options for Jane Doe <JDOE@DOMAIN.EDU>, list WMST-L:
>
> MAIL           You are sent individual postings as they are received
> FULLHDR        Full (normal) mail headers (formerly "FULLBSMTP")
> REPRO          You receive a copy of your own postings
> NOACK          No acknowledgement of successfully processed postings

        Your options may vary; the important part is the first option, MAIL
or NOMAIL.   If the reply from LISTSERV says MAIL, contact your computer
support staff to find out whether they're aware of a mail problem.  If they
don't know of any problem, contact me privately at KORENMAN@UMBC2.UMBC.EDU
  If the reply from LISTSERV says NOMAIL, that means your subscription has
been set to NOMAIL.  The most likely explanation for its being set to
NOMAIL is that mail started to bounce and so I or my assistant set your
subscription to NOMAIL but the notification from LISTSERV bounced, too.  In
that case, contact your system's computer support staff to find out whether
the problem has been solved.  If it has, you can set yourself back to MAIL
(see section A above).  If they aren't aware of a problem, your best bet is
to contact me privately.  Contact me also if the response from
Listserv says you don't have a subscription: your address may have changed.

        If you have questions or encounter problems, please write to me
privately at KORENMAN@UMBC2.UMBC.EDU . However, PLEASE TRY THE ABOVE STEPS
FIRST!!   Under NO circumstances should you send messages about your
subscription to WMST-L.

        C) If you have arranged to get the WMST-L edited digest and you

Greetings,
    I have a student in my Women in Society class who is in dire need of
funding.  She has been so instrumental in helping to launch our
Women's Studies program. . . I'd hate to see her have to leave school
before she's done.

    She is a non-traditional student with three children, divorced, ran
for office, is a member of the Shinnecock Nation and AFrican
American.  She is a Welfare Warrior and is being wooed by Harvard and
Yale.  Right now, she is working four jobs so that she can feed and
clothe her family and is falling behiind in her school work and from
the newspaper delivery job from 2:00 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. is on the
point of collapse.

    Our program needs her.  Do any of you know funding sources that have
a quick turn around from application time to award time?  Please
contact me privately.  If I receive a number of responses, I will
post a list to the list.  She must not be the only one in Women's
Studies who is non-traditional and given the WElfare reform, in
financial need.

Thanks and Peace,
Barbara

My mother Peg Carr is a journals editor at the Ohio State
University Press, who publishes Journal of Money, Credit, and
Banking--as business oriented a journal as you can get!  She has
this to say about gender-neutral language.

>From Peg Carr
Good morning.  The policy throughout the Press is to use gender-neutral
language.  I find less and less masculine language in the papers
submitted
to me for publication, but if I do, I rewrite to change it to
gender-neutral.  Sometimes it's easy, such as changing "policymaker
.. he"
to "policymakers ... they" but often there are real challenges that
require
actual work!!  _The Bias-Free Word Finder_ by Rosalie Maggio is a good
source; subtitled "A dictionary of nondiscriminatory language," it covers
everything from "man: human" to "goody-two-shoes" and "maternity leave"
(parental/family leave) and "kingdom" (realm)  -- as well as language
discriminatory in ways other than gender.  It's fascinating to browse.

My authors are academic or research officers from the Federal
Reserve Banks,
and there is just no question: gender-free language is standard.

Help!!

Below is an ad for a women's studies/economics position for Keene State
College that I have posted to this list previously. So far we have received
applications mainly from economists with *very little to no* women's
studies background.  We would really like to get this ad out there to
interested and qualified women's studies folks as widely as possible.  I
would appreciate any suggestions for where the best places to post or
otherwise distribute the ad.  Where is the primary place (if any?) that
professionals in women's studies do their job searching?

Thanks! - Karen

It seems to me that, while you could put something in the NWSA journal,
anyone who is serious about a job search would look in the Chronicle of
Higher Ed.. Your difficulty may be in finding enough candidates with that
combination of experience??  Between this listserv and the Chronicle, you
should have a wide audience. Internationally, I don't know.

Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

A session on women, feminism, and firearms is being organized for the
November '98 Criminology meetings (which will be held in Washington D.C.).
Possible participants include: Carol Oyster, Mary Zeiss Stange, Kim Vogt,
and Martha McCaughey.  The organizer is looking for another feminist, but
one who will probably be more "anti-gun" than those already on the panel.
Participants needn't be criminologists to participate.

The fellow in charge of organizing the panel doesn't know many feminist
scholars in this area so I'm trying to help come up with one or two more
participants so that the session includes a variety of feminist
perspectives on the issue of women and firearms.  If any of you plan to
attend the Crim meetings in DC, or happen to live in the DC area and would
like to participate in this specific session, please contact me privately
at marth@vt.edu.

Dear Kathy:  The best source is Humboldt.  Surely the university is interested
in its own history.  Second best option is a rich alum, hopefully someone who
profited from educationally from the women's studies program.  Third: a local
foundation interested in women and the university.  Have you talked with the

Folks,
Wednesday Dec. 10 is the National Day of Action on Welfare/Workfare.  In
addition to the general abominations of welfare reform, the new law has
made it impossible for women to stay in school and utilize welfare support
plus financial aid to acquire real job skills that would enable them to
actually earn a living wage.  Already thousands of mothers attending
colleges around the country have been forced out of school or are barely
hanging on. (see Barbara Peters posting)
So I encourage all of you, wherever you are, to get out on Wednesday and
participate in some action.
In SAn FraNCISCO there will be a rally at CIty Hall at 4pm.  To find out
what's happening in other cities, contact Jobs with Justice at 202 434
1106; or 202 434 1477 (fax);  mmaxwell@cwa-union.org

                In solidarity

Thanks to all who responded, many with passion and eloquence, to my
request for information regarding gender neutral language in business and
technical writing.

My students seem to have enjoyed the handout I gave them comprised of
comments and suggestions.  I believe it added to the credibility of my
approach.  What puzzles me is that I've simply never had my word
questioned
before -- people KNOW that changes in language use in this regard have
occurred over the past 20 years.  Calling attention to those mistakes has
always been accepted by my students in the same way that other editorial
comments are accepted.

I wonder why so many of my MBA students fought so hard to believe that
change didn't affect them or apply to their work.

Now that they must concede, I'm taking much ribbing about it -- but as
good natured giving in.  As I told them today, it's a good thing I have a
sense of humor.  In all, this has been a great learning experience all the
way around.

Thanks to wmstl for being here for me.

Hello,

We are putting together a panel on second wave feminism, entitled "Generations
of Feminism: Perspectives from the 1960s and the 1970s," for the 1999
Berkshire Conference on the History of Women. We need someone to act
as a chair and someone to serve as a commentator.  Our papers focus on the
responses of students to second wave feminism and the responses of
traditional women's groups to second wave feminism.  If you are interested
in being a chair or a commentator, please contact one of us.

Cordially,

I am looking for resources/references to assist a counselor at the local
rape crisis center.  Does anyone know of any articles or chapters that
specifically address the issue of rape of lesbians by other lesbians?  I
am looking for acquaintance rape materials specfically, but at this point,
anything will do.  We already have all the lesbian battering resources we
need.

I have done searches with keywords lesbian and rape and have come up
short.  In my dissertation research on the anti-rape movement, I have
never come across anything that might be useful.

Other resources--such as videos, brochures, books, survivor stories, and
the like--would also be helpful.

An issue of concern in respect to gender-neutral language: it can obscure
relevant differences in experience, perhaps returning us to male
perspectives - in the case of plural pronouns as well as specific nouns.
For example, 'Employees received big bonuses this year' doesn't tell you
that the women working as clerks got nothing but the usual measly wages.
'They celebrated their victory over colonial rulers' hides the reality that
women who participated in the struggle were driven back to
gender-subordinate roles. 'Parental' and 'family leave' policies masks the
domestic ideology and practices (pay, hours, etc) as well as biological
differences, which translate into serving most poorly or not at all; e.g.,
the current family leave policy in the US (with no pay) means that women
lose income when they take time off from a job to give birth, a huge loss
if their are complications in the pregnancy and birth, care for a sick
child or other family member, or go to school to deal with a child's
problems there.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF FELLOWSHIPS AND INTERNSHIPS AT THE INSTITUTE FOR WOMEN'S
POLICY RESEARCH



FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:

The Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR) is a non-profit, scientific
research organization that works primarily on issues related to equal
opportunity and economic and social justice for women.  IWPR conducts
research on these issues and holds forums and other events to bring together
activists, advocates, researchers, and policy makers to advance women's agendas.

    IWPR established its fellowship program to assist in the professional
development of students and graduates interested in economic justice for
women.  The fellowships require a nine-month commitment.  The program is
designed to provide fellows with challenging work experiences under the
guidance of researchers with extensive knowledge of women's policy issues
and social science research.

    The Institute will offer three fellowships this year.

     We will hire two Research Fellows.  The research fellows will serve as
general research assistants on a variety of research projects and reports.
Research tasks may include reviewing literature; collecting, checking and
analyzing data; gathering information; and preparing reports and report
graphics.  Attending relevant Congressional briefings, policy seminars and
meetings, and monitoring congressional hearings is also an integral part of
the fellowship program.  One of the research fellows will also serve as a
Special Assistant to the Director of Research and Policy Analysis, Dr. Diana
Zuckerman. Please indicate if you have a preference for one of the two
positions.

Research areas for 1997-8 include:

*studying women's wages, political participation, access to health care, and
other indicators of the status of women on a state-by-state basis;

*studying the work and welfare experiences of low-income women;

*studying the impact of welfare reform on women at the state level;

*analyzing the use of unemployment insurance by low-wage and women workers; and

*analyzing the use of child care by single mothers.

     The Communications and Outreach Fellow works closely with the Director of
Communications on different aspects of IWPR's public relations and outreach
programs.  Tasks include the handling of special requests for public
information materials, including requests from print and electronic media;
planning special events (such as conferences, briefings, and receptions);
layout and design, editing and proofreading; and maintaining IWPR's web
page.  Candidates for this position must have excellent written and verbal
communication skills, the ability to manage varied and multiple
responsibilities at the same time, and have a knowledge of and interest in
policy issues affecting women.  Familiarity with desktop publishing software
and HTML is a plus, but is not required for consideration.

All fellows will also be responsible for a certain amount of general office
work, including such tasks as responding to information requests, assisting
in maintaining the library, and answering telephones.

Applicants should have at least a bachelor's degree in social science,
statistics, or women's policy issues.  Graduate work is desireable but not
required.  Applicants should have basic quantitative and library research
skills.  Knowledge of women's issues and familiarity with Word Perfect is
essential; familiarity with spreadsheets and graphics software a plus.

The stipend for the 1997-8 term is $1200 per month, and includes health
insurance.  The positions are full-time andgenerally  span the academic year
(September-May).  Some fellows may be asked to start as early as June, however.

Persons interested in applying should submit a letter of interest specifying
the fellowship for which they are applying, a resume, two (2) confidential
(sealed) letters of reference, and a writing sample of 3-7 pages to:

Fellowship Coordinator
Institute for Women's Policy Research
1400 20th St., N.W.  Suite 104
Washington, D.C.  20036

Applications are due by March 17.  Candidates will be selected by late
April.  Please note that only complete applications will receive consideration.





INTERNSHIP OPPORTUNITIES:

IWPR's internship program is designed to provide participants with
challenging work experiences under the guidance and supervision of
researchers with extensive knowledge of women's policy issues and social
science research. The Institute gives special emphasis to issues of race,
ethnicity, and class in its projects. There will be three types of
internships available,
as listed below:

Research Internship:

IWPR research interns work as research assistants on a variety of projects.
Research tasks may include reviewing literature, collecting data and
resources, gathering information from public officials and organization
representatives, and preparing reports and summaries. attendance of relevant
seminars, workshops, and meetings and monitoring congressional hearings is
also an integral part of the internship experience. All research interns are
expected to have basic research skills, and a background in the social
sciences and/or statistics is preferred.

Research areas for the summer of 1998 include:

     Studying women's wages and other indicators of their economic status on
        a state by state basis;
     Combining work and welfare to move low-income women and their families
        out of poverty;
     Monitoring welfare reform on the state level; and
     Educating Congress and the Clinton Administration on women's economic
        issues.

Conference Internship:

Conference interns will work in the final stages of planning and executing
IWPR's Fifth Women's Policy Research Conference, "Women's Progress:
Perspectives on the Past, Blueprint for the Future" to be held at the George
Washington University on June 12-13, 1998. Interns will also help with
follow-up from the conference, including coordinating the publication of
Conference Proceedings. The successful conference intern will have
experience with event planning, be detail-oriented, and able to manage a
number of tasks well. Conference interns will be expected to start in mid to
late May.

Development Internship:

Development interns will work with the Director of Development and the
Manager of Membership Services to coordinate fundraising efforts for the
Institute. Interns will have the opportunity to learn about
grant-writing, non-profit fundraising, and direct mail programs. IWPR
receives support from foundations and government agencies, as well as
individual and organizational supporters. Development interns should have an
interest in fundraising and prior experience with fundraising at any level
is desirable.

All IWPR interns must have good computer skills and excellent communication
skills, both oral and written. As about 20 percent of internship time is
taken up with supporting the office, including such vital tasks as
photocopying, answering the phone, faxing, filing, and general office
administration, prior office experience is highly desirable. An interest in
women's issues is essential. IWPR is an affirmative action employer and
people of color are encouraged to apply.

Internships begin in May or June and last a minimum of ten weeks, but
starting and ending dates are flexible. These are full-time positions with a
stipend of $100 per week and a local transportation subsidy.

Persons interested in applying for an internship should submit a letter of
interest, a resume, a letter of recommendation and a writing sample (3-5
pages). Application materials
should be sent to:

     Shannon Garrett
     Research Program Assistant
     Institute for Women's Policy Research
     1400 20th Street, NW, Suite 104
     Washington, DC 20036

Questions should be directed to Shannon Garrett at (202) 785-1921 or by
e-mail at <garrett@www.iwpr.org>

The deadline for receipt of all internship applications is March 16, 1998.
Please note that only complete applications will be considered. Candidates
will be selected by April 15, 1998.

The examples cited here may be gender-neutral, but they don't demonstrate the
problem, which is getting around unmarked male pronouns and assumptions (such
as "each employee received a bonus with his paycheck" becoming "employees
received bonuses with their paychecks").  In beatrice's examples, also, there's
no reason she couldn't refer to "male employees" in the first sentence.  The
second is more problematic because chances are that women were among the "they"
celebrating the victory.  It might take another sentence to bring out the
"hidden reality," but men and women do share many things, and the purpose of
gender neutrality is to include both sexes where both should be included, not
where only one is meant.

Subject:      film:  "Clotheslines"

Do any of you know how I can get a copy of the very fine film, "Clotheslines"?
It's a documentary, a kind of montage of interviews and clips of women doing
laundry, and explores the range of emotional responses to this kind of domestic
work, as drudgery, source of pride/identity, as sensual experience, as spiritual

connection to other women.  One eerie part has a woman's laughter turning into
sobs.  It's beautifully filmed, I think, and very good for WS classes.

thanks,
Jane

Today's monthly excerpt from the WMST-L User's Guide:

     10)  "I'VE BEEN AWAY FOR TWO WEEKS.  I'D LIKE TO SEE WHAT I'VE MISSED
ON WMST-L DURING THE TIME I'VE BEEN GONE.  IS IT POSSIBLE TO ACCESS
PREVIOUS MESSAGES?"   [also useful for new subscribers]

     Yes.  All WMST-L messages are automatically archived.  The 1991
archives are arranged in monthly logs; beginning in Jan., 1992, the logs
were changed to a weekly format.  To find out what logs are available, you
can send LISTSERV the following command: INDEX WMST-L .  You'll then
receive a list of the available logs.  To obtain the logs, send LISTSERV
the following command:     GET WMST-L [filename]

where [filename] is the name of the log file you want.  For example:

     GET WMST-L LOG9609a

will get you the log for the first week ("a") in September 1996
(9609 refers to the 9th month of 1996).  LOG9612b is the log for the second
week ("b") in Dec. 1996 (December is the 12th month).  (It's possible that
the wording of your request may take a slightly  different form, depending
on your mail system, but what you want is  WMST-L LOGnnnnl.)   Warning:
some of these logs are LARGE (> 300K).  As a result, you may not be
permitted to get more than a few logs on any given day (the current limit
is 20 files  or 2M - i.e., 2000K).  NOTE: Logfiles from before 1995 are no
longer available on UMDD.  To make room for newer logfiles, they were moved
to the Women's Studies archive on InforM
(http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Topic/WomensStudies/ ).  As time passes,
other old logfiles will also be moved to InforM.

        The WMST-L filelist contains instructions designed to teach you how
to search the UMDD logfiles for specific subjects.  The instructions I
recommend are contained in a file called SEARCH SIMPLE.  It explains the
new, simplified search procedures.  This file is available on the web or
via e-mail.  The web URL is http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/simplesearch.html .
To get it by e-mail, send the message GET SEARCH SIMPLE to
LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU.  These instructions apply only to logfiles on UMDD,
not those that have been moved to InforM.

                          *******************

        Each month, I post sections from the WMST-L User's Guide to remind
subscribers of the list's resources and procedures.  If changes have been
made since the last time a section was posted, the subject header will
begin "Revision:".  Also, you can now consult the User's Guide anytime
you'd like if you have access to the World Wide Web.  The URL is
http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/user-guide.html .  You can also get a copy of the
guide via e-mail by sending the message GET GUIDE WMST-L to

Hey, folks:

    I'm an adjunct at Georgetown and order books for my class through the
local women's bookstore downtown.  It's a great way to expose Women's
Studies majors to feminist community-based enterprise.

    Do other folks do this?  The superstores are killing the small bookstores,
and even my little course makes a big difference for the DC store.

I'm interested to know how this film is used in women's studies courses.
I love the film, saw it in a visual anthropology course years ago, and
have referred to it numerous times in conversations with colleagues, but
it is not well known.  I have thought about using the film to stimulate
discussion of issues around gender and generation and biography.  Any
other ideas?

I have no objection to the practice per se.  In fact I am opposed to any
attempt of university book stores' efforts to monopolize the market.  I
have some suspicion of doing so to support the book stores rather than
to seek lower prices for the students.  Part of your post raised that
suspicion.

We in the Women's Studies Institute at Georgia State University order our
books through Charis Books and More in Atlanta.  Some of our instructors
in introductory women's studies courses require students to visit Charis
and write about their visit.

A senior student majoring in women's studies and criminology is
looking for a graduate school.  She is looking for a graduate school
for an M.A. in women's studies.  Are there any programs out there that
have an emphasis on women in the Middle East and/or feminist
criminology?  She would appreciate any help with information.  Reply

Jaime and list,

I have been ordering books for my women's studies classes from the Atlanta
feminist bookstore, Charis, for 2 years now.  As you say, it is a great
way to bring the store business and expose students to a feminist
organization.

Regarding prices (Wm. Pendleton's concern): in my experience, the
university bookstores jack up book prices without having to explain
themselves, not to mention reselling used books at only 20% less than the
cover price (after buying them back from students for a tiny fraction of
what they paid).  I have no problem with ordering textbooks from a store
that charges the same prices when I know that the money will support a
feminist cause.  I mean, someone will profit off of these sales; why
not the feminists?  Since I keep book prices in mind when designing the
course (I'm sure most of you out there do), students will be no better off
at the campus bookstore than at the feminist one.

But is it the prof's responsibility to seek out *lower* prices for
the books they order, as Wm. Pendleton's post suggests?  Must I actually
consider ordering my students' books from a superstore in the hopes that I
can save them 10%?  These are not rhetorical questions.

Choosing to order books from the university bookstore (or anywhere else)
is just as political a decision as choosing to order them from the
feminist store.

Cheers,

Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I am making this request for an undergrad WS student who is writing a senior
thesis for our gov't & philosophy departments on the social justice and legal
 theories behind new legislation regarding sex offenders--for instance,
mandates that sex offenders register when released from prison.

She would like to investigate the claim that such men are "not insane but
are generally men who have 'normal' [for our culture, at least] sexual
personalities."

Can anyone direct her to studies or other publications that might illuminate
this claim? (which she has derived to a great extent from Susan Griffin's
"Rape:  The All-American Crime")

Unless significant demand for replies emerges on the list, PLEASE RESPOND
PRIVATELY.

I am an instructor at the University of Florida and always try to support
the local women's bookstore in Gainesville.  I have thought about ordering
books through them.  some problems that i have run into are 1) athletes
and other scholarship students may have book vouchers that are only
accepted at the University bookstore 2)students with disabilities have to
get theri books at teh University bookstore - I'm not sure if this has to
do with scholarships also.  I am not as well informed about some of these
issues as i probably should be, but i just wanted to share a few problems
i have encountered.  so, while i want to support the smaller bookstores, i
can't do that at the expense of my students.  i do usually announce in
class special events, speakers, and discussion groups taking place at the
local bookstores.  i also try to order books that are optional reading
through these stores.

The moral issue seems to me to be to what extent should we compel
students to by from one source, even when we regard the experience as
valuable.  I make my selections of texts available widely so that sources
can compete--perhaps by price--for the students' custom.  Even though I
thought it might be educational for them to visit a Christian or Right
Wing or Left Wing bookstore, I would make that a separate assignment, not
a necessary spending to support a cause.  There is here a slippery slope
into which faculty should not move.  If I pick a favorite cause and
compel students to support it, is not everyone free to do the same?
Would the result of such choices be good for the intellectual
development of the students?

The one time I used the film it was in an intro. to women's studies course.
The students didn't "get" it, to my dismay.  I think it's a fine, very fine,
film, but may need more setup than I gave it.  The women featured are of
my mother's generation, probably in their late 70's or early 80's by now.
For present students, this means it's their grandmothers' generation, but
the women featured are inner city women (Brooklyn?), and primarily Italian-
American.  Laundry was laundry(!) for them, but at the same time it was a
medium for their relationships to their husbands, to their neighbors/friends,
and at the same time it provided an opportunity to enjoy air, the earth, the
sun, the beauty of fabric.  One can use the film as a vehicle for the study
of work itself, women's work, class issues, social relations, and last but
not least, patriarchal oppression.

    I think it is important for everyone who cares about the
future of small presses, including feminist presses,
to support the stores that have carried their
books all along, and which are committed to doing so in the future.
I applaud instructors who use these stores as a site
for their course books.
By using the feminist bookstores, women's studies instructors
are also maintaining the connection to the community from which
women's studies emerged. The bookstores are settings for
community building and sustaining, and women's studies
within the academy would be diminished without them.
    Students are always free to shop around with book lists
in hand anyway, and now they can even order them
over the web -- they are never forced to buy them from
one place.

Today's monthly excerpt from the WMST-L User's Guide:

     11)  "HOW DO I FIND OUT WHAT FILES ARE AVAILABLE FROM WMST-L, AND HOW
DO I OBTAIN THE FILES I WANT?"

        To find out what files are available, send LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU
(or, on Bitnet, LISTSERV@UMDD) the same command mentioned in the previous
section: INDEX WMST-L.  The list you'll receive from LISTSERV includes
files as well as logs.  To obtain the file(s) you want, send LISTSERV the
following command:

     GET [filename] WMST-L

where [filename] is the two-word name of the file you want.  For
example, suppose you send for the filelist (INDEX WMST-L) and see the
following listing:

*   Policies for cross-listing courses with Women's Studies
  CROSSLST POLICIES   ALL OWN V      79   436 92/12/07 20:41:03

To get this file, you'd send the message GET CROSSLST POLICIES WMST-L
to LISTSERV@UMDD (Bitnet) or LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU (Internet).

Note that [filename] consists of two words separated by a space and
not a period.  (Adding WMST-L after the two-word filename is optional; it
simply makes sure that if two lists have a file with the same name, you'll
get the right one.)

        IMPORTANT NOTE: women's studies syllabi are contained in a
subdirectory called SYLLABI, while feminist film reviews are to be found
in a subdirectory called FILM, and reference book mini-reviews are in the
WMSTBOOK  subdirectory.  To find out what syllabi, film reviews, or
reference book mini-reviews a subdirectory contains, send LISTSERV the
command INDEX SYLLABI (or INDEX FILM or INDEX WMSTBOOK).  To obtain the
file(s) you want, send LISTSERV the following command:

GET [filename] SYLLABI  (or replace SYLLABI w/FILM or WMSTBOOK as needed)

        If you are requesting a film review, be aware that the
filename always takes the form FILM REVx (e.g., FILM REV25); the name
of the film is NOT the filename!  You can request more than one file
at once; just be sure to put each request on a separate line.
LISTSERV will then send the file(s) to you either in a mail message or
in Netdata format.  You can force LISTSERV to send them in a mail
message by adding F=MAIL at the end of each command.  For example, GET
[filename] FILM F=MAIL .  Or, to retrieve files sent by LISTSERV in
Netdata format, follow these instructions:

     If your e-mail address is on a VAX/VMS machine, when you get a message
that one or more files have arrived at your e-mail address, you should type
"RECEIVE *" (do not include the quotation marks) at the $ prompt.  This
command will put the file(s) into your main directory.  You can then type
"TYPE filename" (replace "filename" with the actual name of the file) to
read the file.  If it's a long file, you can read it more effectively by
typing "TYPE/PAGE filename."  If your e-mail address is on an IBM VM/CMS
machine, either use your mailer front end or type RLIST and RECEIVE the
file into your FLIST. Go into your FLIST to look at the file.

     If your e-mail address is on a different kind of machine OR you are
using Profs or some other kind of similar mailing system, go ahead and try
the above commands.  If they do not work, CALL YOUR COMPUTER SERVICES
OFFICE.  The people there should be able to help you and/or give you a
manual for your mailing system commands.

        NOTE:  Many WMST-L files (and a lot more!) are also available on
the Women's Studies archive on InforM, the University of Maryland's Online
Information Service.  The URL is
http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Topic/WomensStudies/ . If you don't have
access to the Web, you can telnet to inform.umd.edu . Select Educational

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; CHARSET=US-ASCII

I thought I'd say a few words about Jamie's comment on ordering books from
feminist, women-owned, and independent bookstores.  My partner and I own
(and she runs) an independent bookstore.  It is really helpful in the
struggle against the major chains, which are forcing more and more
independents to close down, to support your local bookstore.  However,
there are some limitations:

1.  Warn students that unless the bookstore sells used books, they cannot
return books to the independent bookstore at the end of the semester.

2.  If possible, get a show of hands of how many students plan on actually
purchasing the book.  If you tell the bookstore you need 30 copies and
only 15 students buy the book, the bookstore is stuck with extra inventory
(and this is expensive).

3.  Most independent bookstores cannot easily obtain textbooks.  The
distribution system for textbooks is different from that of other books.
However, if you assign novels, writers like bell hooks, Listen Up, etc..,
consider your feminist, woman-owned, or independent bookstore.

4.  When you call the bookstore, ask to speak to the owner or manager.
Tell that person which books you want to order (having the ISBN is handy
but not essential) and how many copies you'll need.  The owner will likely
call you back to let you know of the book's availability.

Wm. W. Pendleton asks:  ". . .to what extent should we compel students to
by from one source, even when we regard the experience as valuable."

I'm sorry, but don't a majority of professors indirectly *compel* their
students to buy from the campus bookstore and/or those close to the campus
by virtue of providing those stores with advance notice of what texts they
will be using for the coming semester?

He further adds: "If I pick a favorite cause and compel students to support
it, is not everyone free to do the same?"

The issue here, as I see it, is not about supporting a "cause", but about
supporting a community resource.

Subject:      Clotheslines

I've used the film once, in a course title Women, Race, and Class, and though
the film is limited in its analysis of how women of different racial groupings
feel about washing, it is very good on women's perspectives across class lines.


I'm not sure which course I would use it in now, either Intro or the feminist
thought course would work--both would work I think because they allow viewers to

think about this "universal" practice from so many different perspectives.
Those who are critical of laundering for others as "women's work" because it is
demeaning are challenged to recognize the beauty and sensual pleasure of clean
sheets on a clothesline (e.g.).  Those who see laundering uncritically as a
loving care for family are challenged to see how very hated and painful it is
for other women. . . . Basically it raises this convention, everyday practice as

an important topic for analysis and musing.  It allows young students a chance
to put their own experience into a context with other women's and to see things
"in a new light."  I'd be tempted to show it in the section I do on "Women and
Work" (currently I show the also excelled "Fastfood Women," by Appalshop).

Beyond these ideas, I'm sure there are many other ways to use this film (e.g.,
in a course on documentary or filmmaking!).

Thanks Jaime for bringing up this topic.

As a feminist bookstore worker (Amazon Bookstore in Minneapolis), it's
great to see y'all having this discussion. Though we've been trying to get
the profs at U of Minn Women's Studies to order from us over the past
several years (and a few individuals have -- thanks), we've only been
REALLY successful in just the past six-months. We are not close to the
university which is part of the problem. Here's what's made the difference
to us:

1) an ally among the faculty who has made it a priority to support us and
get the other profs in the department to do so as well

2) our willingness to take books TO THE CLASS! this is especially good for
undergraduate intro classes that have 100+ students -- no need to for them
to travel and alleviates issues of accessibility

3) with the assistance of the department chair and others at the
university, we've been able to work out the details for students with
vouchers

4) we've worked out a system for buying back used books -- similar to the
one used by the university bookstore and modeled on what other feminist
booktores (A Room of One's Own and Charis) have done

5) we don't jack up the prices - actually, I think our prices are
competitive with the univ. bookstore. Though we might sometimes have to
raise the prices slightly -- you probably don't realize that as soon as the
PUBLISHER smells that the books are for a course they give much less
discount to the retailer - I'm not sure why -- perhaps they think it's
guaranteed sales. but a book that might typically get a 40% discount will
only get a 20% discount if it's for a course, and we pay the freight which
can be quite costly (to the point of eating up any kind of profit!). In
general, most unversity presses give horrible discounts --it's almost as if
they don't care if they sell the books! and the effort to order the books,
receive them, get them organized for the courses is much more work than
what we normally have to do. so don't feel "ripped off" by the bookstore --
we have our overhead to pay as well.

6) the sales we made to the university last semester basically SAVED our
store from the downward spiral we've been experiencing. Without this
suport, we'd be in pretty bad shape. I hesitate to say "going to close" but
the reality is, that this shadow hangs over us every month. we won't say it
until we're desparate -- we won't cry wolf. Coursebook sales help us
considerably. We've been in business for 27+ years. We're well-managed and
fiscally responsible. Our financial difficulties are based in industry
trends where independents are suffering to the aggressiveness of the chains
NOT in poor business behavior. We are constantly trying new things to stay
fresh and interesting to a commmunity who'se support can sometimes be
inconsistent.

As teaching women's studies can be very political, so is it very political
at what bookstore you decide to buy your books. Any place where there's a
"marketplace" for ideas becomes threatened when those ideas are held in one
place -- e.g. Barnes & Noble.  It's a much larger issue than probably can
be discussed here but one that needs to happen (Perhaps a forum at the next
NWSA?).

Its not only about buying coursebooks -- but I know there are MANY feminist
profressors who don't shop for their books in feminist bookstores! even for
their own interest or research -- while we often make the effort to get
interesting academic stuff in the store. It's kind of like chicken and egg.
Bookstores may have to make financial decisions not to stock expensive
academic books because no one's buying them --  and then when profs finally
decide to come into the store they complain because the academic books are
not there! And there's LOTS of interesting books from small women's presses
that are generally not stocked in chain stores that we DO stock that never
get seen because profs don't come to find them. I suggest that profs in
community's where there are womens bookstores should have some kind of
living room conversation about how to approach these problems. unlike your
local B&N -- where book buying is done from a national office with little
respect for local commnuuity -- most women's bookstore ARE receptive and
responsive to their local communities and will be very interested in having
serious conversations with people about what to stock.

That's enough from me for now. I'm happy to answer questions and make
suggestions.

Mev

PS - I am forwarding this message to the feminist bookstores network list
so that women's bookstores can have these conversations with profs in their
local communities.

You might find the most recent issue of RADICAL HISTORY REVIEW, special
issue on "culture of poverty" of interest.  Like always, RHR has a section
on teaching that includes course outlines with all relevant readings (and
the original sources to make it accessible), as well as exposition on the
ways in which the course is conceived.

Given that we are talking, for the most part, about women's studies
courses it *is* sensible, and good for the
students' intellectual  development to send them to feminist bookstores
-if one was teaching a course on comparative religion, it might make sense
to send them to a Jewish and Christian bookstore (or whatever religions
one was teaching about). Still, I don't see any real difficulty with
ordering the books through the feminist bookstores, sending the students
to them, and also ordering a *few* from the regular bookstores, so that
those who need to go there for whatever personal reasons, can be directed
there when they come to the teacher to say so. I'd like to point out, that
in my graduate and undergraduate studies, I had several teachers who
ordered books through other bookstores than the University monopoly one,
and I only loved them for it. I also had professors who assumed that the
class was small enough (with small seminars of course) that they didn't
need to order the books at all, and recommended the library, local
bookstores and photocopying (for articles) or some combination thereof.
In any case, this isn't a matter of simply being someone's "pet cause,"
and to me, it seems trivializing to label it so.

1. "Sexual Violence" by Linda A. Fairstein (1993 Wm Morrow & Co New York)
2. "Boys Will Be Boys: Breaking the Link Between Masculinity and Violence" by

I don't know who began this "conversation," but I am thrilled to have it
appearing on this list, for I've been somewhat depressed about the male-
centered news in the daily paper, including the big feature reporting 35,000
or more polygamous Mormon families, as well as the smaller feature on the
importance of the Beats to the male young (and you know of course how sexist
that fifties movement was).  As if that were not enough, the annual contest re
most popular movie star was reported also in the today-s NYT, with the first
22 places going to MEN, and with the first woman mentioned as number 23.   So,
yes, it's heartening to me to hear these voices of women's studies faculty
calling for support for feminist bookstores.

And I know you are not forgetting feminist presses either.  One of our staff
members has written a short page that we are going to distribute at the
upcoming MLA conference in Toronto, urging faculty to consider small presses
and independent bookstores when thinking about texts for their courses, and
trying to order books rather than coursepacks for students.  As soon as I can
learn to download, I will try to put this on our list.  For now, thank you,
list readers and writers.

You might check out Our Guys by Lefkowitz. It is a documentary account of a
teenage girl with mental retardation who was gang raped by several high
school athletes. The author's research was guided by the question of how
such "normal" boys could commit such a crime. It is a well-written and
gripping, depressing and angering book.

Today's monthly excerpt from the WMST-L User's Guide:

        WMST-L welcomes the posting of job and conference announcements,
calls for papers, and the like, as long as the announcement has some
explicit connection to Women's Studies.  Announcements without such a
connection should NOT be sent to WMST-L.  The wish to reach more female
candidates, however laudable, is NOT adequate reason to post
non-Women's-Studies announcements.  Heavy mail volume is a persistent
problem on WMST-L; the list cannot accommodate the increased volume that a
more liberal posting policy would bring.  (Keep in mind that each year,
there are literally thousands of academic job openings.  Most institutions
wish to show that they have tried to reach female and minority applicants.
Whereas some commercial publications charge hundreds of dollars to carry
even a small ad, WMST-L is free.  Thus, unless we restrict postings, the
list is likely to be INUNDATED with job announcements.)

                          ************************

        Each month, I post sections from the WMST-L User's Guide to remind
subscribers of the list's resources and procedures.  If changes have been

Seconnd that recommendation.  It has a very good analysis of the culture of
jockery that meant that these ordinary boys could do not wrong and that they
were the icons of their school and their community.  Also good for looking
at emotional effects of marginalization.

I would also appreciate titles on these subjects.  I am currently
organizing two initiatives for which I need bibliographies.  The first is
the development of a resource centre at our mental health rights coaltion
and the second is the development of a bibliography for a new list for
Women Who (experience mood swings, fear, voices and visions).  The list is
called Madgrrls and can be found under the Madnation site at:

http://www.madnation.org/madness.htm

I'm looking for biography, autobiography, fiction, non-fiction, poetry.

Thanks so much for your help. You can e-mail me privately, if you wish, at:

I would add that independents are important to keeping a wide variety of
books available, and helping small publishers stay alive in the growing
climate of megamonopoly. Women's bookstores were the first base for
publishers of feminist books, which now have attained a much wider
base--but that could change again. It's crucial to keep that base alive, to
support it. If Mr. Pendleton dismisses that as ideological, so was the
previous situation, where feminist scholarship was effectively marginalized
and kept off the bookshelves.

The site was constructed by one of our students, Karen Jones.  We hired
her to learn how to construct a webpage and to construct the page.  Thus,
she gained a new skill and we gained a great webpage!

At the bottom of the homepage, you will find "constructed by Karen Jones
for Women's Studies Institute"  If you click on Women's Studies Institute,
you will get a form in which to send us a message.  We hope you will
visit, send students interested in studying women's studies at GSU

It's great to see this conversation going on on the list. Feminist
bookstores are indeed a great resource, and really do need your support.

We publish a catalog that lists the names, addresses (email and URL) and
phone numbers of all the feminist bookstores in the U.S. and Canada -- and
includes many titles from feminist presses -- which is available at no
charge at your local feminist bookstore. It is also on the web at

        I'm very pleased that Diane Fowlkes announced the new website for
Georgia State U's Women's Studies Institute.  I hope other people  will
also announce their program's new site on WMST-L.  However, please do not
write to WMST-L simply to ask people to look at your no-longer-new site
unless it contains resources relevant to a specific query.
There are more than 350 such sites that I know of....Just imagine what your
emailbox would look like if, say, half the sites decided to send
announcements of their existence to WMST-L.  If you want to see what the
websites of other Women's Studies programs look like, or whether a site
exists for a particular program, take a look at my Women's Studies
Programs, Departments, and Research Center page
(http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/programs.html ).  It lists more than 350 links
from all over the world.

    And, of course, if your program/department/research center has a
web site that I've missed, please let me know PRIVATELY.  I can be
reached at korenman@umbc2.umbc.edu .

    Many thanks.

Proposed panel for 1998 American Studies Association:

Invisible Men:   Interrogations of Ethnicity and Embodiment in American
Postwar Visual Culture

Despite some scholarly attention to the impact of race and gender on the
development and dissemination of visual and material culture in the United
States, its recent histories rarely interrogate the way in which ethnicity
affects all facets of the creation and reception of visual discourse in
American culture and society.  Our panel seeks to render visible the
particular ethnic identities of the producers and consumers of American
visual culture and criticism from the post-WWII period to the present
moment.  We wish to excavate and render problematic the manner in which
(re)markings of a white, Anglo-Saxon, and Protestant identity/body as
transparent and normative obscure or render invisible real relations of
power and domination operative in American institutional, intellectual and
social discourses.  What alternative histories of American visual culture
emerge when we attend to ethnicity as a salient category of analysis?  How
do criticism and pedagogy which posit white middle class heterosexual
masculinity as a privileged locus of cultural production construct
American national historical narratives and myths which silence and censor
competing creative identities which acquire definition within the context
of ethnicity?

     We invite papers which explore how the production and consumption
of forms of American visual and material culture (including, but not
limited to painting, sculpture, prints, film, photography, and television)
from 1945 to the present bear on the embodied--and culturally
constructed--ethnic identities of their creators and consumers.  Papers
addressing intersections between ethnicity and gender, race, class, and
their articulation as tensions between national and international,
figuration and abstraction, visual and discursive, memory and experience,
tradition and innovation, citizen/resident and exile, the neighborhood and
the city, are particularly welcomed.

Some questions which panelists may consider but to which they may no means
limit themselves include:

--what are the roles of institutions and patronage in establishing and
affirming ethnic identit(ies) in the United States in the period under
consideration?
--what is the status/role of the immigrant and the exile in the history of
American visual culture?
--how do we locate inscribed and performed signifiers of ethnicity on the
body, in the home and studio, and within the production of American
visual artists?
--what relationships and tensions obtain between gender, sexuality, race
and ethnicity in American visual production?
--does the affirming, or identification of ethnicity necessarily render
anxious or  place pressure on the notion of an "American" artist?
--how has the American and international press, newspapers, periodicals,
magazines, TV, film inscribed and marketed American visual producers for
different audiences?
--do certain ethnically marked artists produce different, or differently
inflected art for varying readerships or communities?

Subject:      is ABIGAILS-L alive?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

        Hi.  I've been updating my Gender-Related Electronic Forums
listing (http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/forums.html), and purely by accident
I've discovered that the feminist activist list ABIGAILS-L no longer
exists at the address I have for it.  Indeed, the netcom.com site now
runs a different software, and the site claims not to have heard of
ABIGAILS-L.  Does the list still exist?  If so, I'd appreciate updated
information.  If it has officially died, I'd also appreciate
confirmation of that.  Please reply privately.  I'll make whatever info
I get available at the Gender-Related Electronic Forums site, which
includes descriptions of more than 300 women- and gender-related e-mail
lists and which also lists the changes made in the past month.

        Also, if anyone knows of other women-related activist lists
that I don't already include on my Activist sub-section
(http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/f_actv.html), I'd be most grateful if you'd
let me know.

        Though I'm writing from my korenman@umbc.edu address, you can
reply either to that address or the more usual korenman@umbc2.umbc.edu .

        Many thanks.

    Joan

As to the request a while ago about birthing and midwivery, Robbie Kahn's
Bearing Meaning came out last year from U of Illinois Press and won a Jesse
Bernard award.   This would offer a review of the literature you need.  Also
see Mary O'Brien's Politics of Reproduction.  She was a Marxist midwife who
wrote a very feminist class analysis, discussed in Robbie's book.  Also my
Islands of Women and Amazons:  Representations and Realities has a chapter on
birthing with a Maya midwife that would include references you need.  it is
UMI Feb 1996, and forthcoming from University of Texas Press.  Batya

To all of you who answered the all about the new journal, here is an uptodate
posting, FYI. Also, if you want to meet in Toronto, you can leave e a message
at the Bond Place Hotel, 416-362-6061. If you leave a message by late the
night of the 27th, I will call you about dinner on the 28th.  I can't say
where as of yet.  You could also come to the organizational meeting of the
sf/fantasy/utopian section which is scheduled for Monday afternoon, and is in
the program in the 3:45 slot.  Cheers. Batya Weinbaum, VT batyawein@aol.com
Announcing FEMSPEC,
an interdisciplinary feminist journal
dedicated to
critical and creative works
in the realms of SF, fantasy, magical realism,
and other super-natural genres.

If you are interested in speculating, theorizing, creating and questioning
gender across the boundaries, we are recruiting editors and readers as well
as manuscripts. We are emphasizing interdisciplinary approaches, and
encourage work on teaching as well as literary and cultural criticism and
creative material.  We hope an approach to pedagogy will bring in work from a
wider area of disciplines.  We are interested in a variety of feminist
approaches, and aim to be inclusive of ethnic and cultural diversity in an
internationalist perspective.

Articles and abstracts submitted in triplicate by March 1.  Creative writing
is accepted:  short fiction, 15 pages or less; poetry, 3 poems per
submission.  Art and book reviews of 1000 words or less also welcome.  For
those interested in reviewing or being on the editorial or advisory boards,
please also send vitas and areas of interest.  We are at a formative stage,
and are seeking a journal to host our first issue so that we have a concrete
product with documented response to show publishers and institutions to
solicit support.  The impetus came from the collectively perceived lack of
attention to these works in feminist journals and audiences, the lack of
consistently evolving developed levels of feminism in sf criticism, and the
inadequacy of mr publishing outlets in the US.  The response from initial
postings has been large, international, appreciative and indicative of a
sustainable community of readers and contributors.

Possible upcoming articles and stories include: gender in Star Trek; women's
ghost stories of the nineteenth century; constructing feminism through
folklore; contemporary women's rewriting of folk and fairy tales generally
classified as fantasy; Marion Zimmer Bradley's Lady of Avalon; Octavia
Butler; Marge Piercy's Body of Glass; ecofeminism and menstrual reclamation;
afrocentric womanist sf; facing nightmares of previous victimization;
paranormal possibilities in women's sf; trickster aesthetic in women's ethnic
and world literature.

As a feminist and the mother of a 13 year old girl I have been having
dreams about her as a sexual being.  Most of them involve a man who is not
kind or doesn't use protection and in my dream I end up threatening
castration.  What my dreams have helped me realize is that I need to talk
to my daughter about sex in an uncensored manner - not just the "this is
your clitoris, this is your vagina" which I have done, but more about my
own experiences discovering my sexuality.  --  If you could say ANYTHING to
a young woman about sex -
if you could be totally uncensored, what would you say?  Is anyone
familiar with the literature on this subject?  Please respond privately
unless you believe it would benefit other readers.

Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

     Hi, again.  I want to thank everyone who responded to my query.  It
turns out that ABIGAILS-L **is** alive, but it's having some problems with
the majordomo program that it runs on (when I asked that majordomo for a
list of the lists it ran, it gave me a long list that did NOT include
ABIGAILS-L).

        While I'm passing along list info, I might add that I was told that
Irene Stuber's two lists, CATTS-CLAW and WOAH-HERSTORY are temporarily
suspended while Irene writes a book.  I haven't yet changed Gender-Related
Electronic Forums to reflect this, since I've been trying to get more info
first.  But I HAVE been making some other changes to Gender-Related
Electronic Forums, including adding a bunch of lists in the last few days
(most recently ES-MAMAS, also known as Eurosapphic Mamas, a list about
lesbian motherhood in Europe).  I've also added a new sub-section, the
16th, to deal with age-related lists for women and girls.  The overall
URL for Gender-Related Electronic Forums is
http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/forums.html  .

    Again, many thanks.

An obvious but important point is that while some small bookstores
cannot buy back the books they sell to your students, other stores in
the area may be able to. A few  years ago when I began ordering
their books at Charis Books here in Atlanta, some students expressed
resistance because they couldn't sell them back. A little digging soon
revealed a store right on the edge of the campus that would take them
back, and at much better prices than the university bookstore.

I don't compel my students to do any kind of outside-of-class
activities (other than screening films we'll be discussing), so I
don't make them actually go to Charis -- Charis is on campus one day
at the beginning of the semester selling books.

As someone else has already pointed out, ordering books from one
source does not compel students to purchase their books there -- they
are free to go elsewhere. However, I do explain that I am ordering
from Charis, when they will be on campus, and why I feel it is
important to order through them. Their resistance to the idea melts
away, though it still takes a lot of persuading to get other women's
studies instructors to join the program, sometimes.

Kate Millet's book is _The Loony Bin Trip_.  It's a compelling, though
sometimes frightening, account of her experiences.

I don't think I read the beginning of this thread, so forgive me if
someone else has already mentioned these books:

  _Girl, Interrupted_ (1993) by Susan Kaysen, an autobiographical account
ofKaysen's institutionalization for borderline personality disorder.

    _The Beast_ (1996)  by Tracy Thompson--account of the author's
battle with severe chronic depression.

    Of course---_The Bell Jar_ by Sylvia Plath.

    _Black Sun_ (_Soleil Noir_, c1987), a rather dense treatment of
depression by Frenchfeminist psychoanalyst Julia Kristeva.

    _The Broken Mirror_- (1997)-first book length account for a mass
audience of body dysmorphic disorder, written by a woman clinical
psychologist.

    Anne Sexton's poetry, including the short collection, _Poems for
Doctory Y_.

    Although you don't mention narratives of addiction, I'll throw in
a mention of _Drinking: A Love Story_ (1997), the female author of which
escapes me as well as the '70's classic, _I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can._

    Finally, the most well-represted "mental disorders" in recent
fiction and non-fiction remains anorexia, with bulemia following a cose
second.  For a wonderful bibliography, consult Susan Bordo's _Unbearable
Weight:  Feminism, Western Culture, and the Body_ (1994?).

    And of the course the standards, _Sybil_ and _I Never Promised You
a Rose Garden_.

    Films:

    _Angel at My Table_ (1995?), directed by Jane Campion, I
believe--senstive account of New Zealand author Jane Frame's
(mis)diagnosis with schizophrenia in the early '60's.

    _Agnes of God_(mid 1980's) --based on the play of the same name;
starring Meg Tilly and Jane Fonda; the story of a reporter who
investigates the story of nun who claimed to have been impregnanted by
Christ

    _Breaking the Waves_--winner of 1996 Cannes Film Festival;
visually stunning story of the fine line between divine inspiration, love,
and dementia set in the north of Scotland in the 1970's.

    These listings are all off the top of my head.  I'd be happy to
post full bibliographic info if enough people are interested.

I am trying to finish up something I am working on and find myself with two
questions (one much easier than the other) that I hope members of this very
helpful list can help me with.
1. What year was NOW founded?
2. I want to cite some of Mary Payer's early work in the philosophy of
science on the objectivity of scientific language and how it makes truth
claims hard to challenge, however, my only reference is a paper she gave in
1977 at one of the Barnard conferences on feminism and scholarship.  I seem
to remember she published a book or article sometime after this, but cannot
find anything about it in my notes.  Does anyone know about her later work in
this area?
Thanks and please reply privately unless you would like to discuss Payer's
work.  Rhoda Unger

I'm looking for writing on the emergence of women's studies courses,
programs, and departments in academia (U.S. specifically, but other
countries would be of interest as well).

In addition, if anyone knows of any published writing on the move to
change "women's studies" to "gender studies," that would be helpful as
well.

Thanks, and happy holidays!

WOMEN'S STUDIES QUARTERLY has been in business for 26 years.  Its pages
contain the history of women's studies.  If you don't have access to the first
20 years, then buy the 25th anniversary issue, which came out this past
summer, and which is orderable from The Feminist Press (Fax: 212-650-8966 for
direct ordering).  This issue selects from the 25 years, and includes a
generous portion of early reports from programs all over the country.  Two
other suggestions:  my own out of print book, MYTHS OF EDUCATION: Selected
Essays, 1965-1984 (Indiana U.P.) may be available in your library.  My essays
over those 20 years provide a kind of history. I also wrote a report for the
Department of Education in 1977 called SEVEN YEARS LATER.  They printed 10,000
copies which were distributed free.  I have a few of them still and can zerox
one of them for you if you would like to pay for that service. But you may be
able to find it in a library under my name. Finally, if you have access to a
good library, there was a series of monographs--FEMALE STUDIES 1-10, published
between 1970 and 1975 that also contain what are now "documents."  There were
also two Ford Foundation reports: one by Kate Stimpson, the other by Beverly
Guy-Sheftall.  And of course, way back in the early 1980s there was a SIGNS
piece by Marilyn Boxer.  I'm sure there are other sources, but this should do
for a start.
     And I should add: I am delighted that you are interested.  In another
year, we may see a book by Marilyn Boxer now in press.  Cheers.  Florence Howe

        I'm not sure about published work, but I do know that there have
been several discussions on WMST-L of the pros and cons of "women's
studies" vs. "gender studies".  Two rounds of the discussion have been
saved as WMST-L files.  To get them, send the following two-line message to
LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU:

        GET WOMEN_VS GENDER
        GET WOMEN_VS GENDER2

        Note that there's an underscore ( _ ) between WOMEN and VS, and
that VS is vs (as in versus).

'Gender-inclusive' is a great way to put it, Jacqueline! the term to

gender is in every aspect of reality. Putting it the way you do identifies
the risk of 'gender neutral' to obscure.     Why don't you post it to the

I am seeking ideas for novels written by women who live outside the U.S.
and who address issues of race, ethnicity, class, and/or sexual
identity--in addition to gender--in their work. I hope to assign such a
novel in an undergraduate course about global perspectives on women. My
hope is to provide students with more multi-dimensional understandings of
women's lived experiences than would be provided by other types of
textbooks.

If you have suggestions or have used novels of this type in your courses,
I'd appreciate hearing from you. Please respond privately to
LLP@cnsvax.albany.edu

In a recent interview, Ruth Brown, often referred to as a contemporary
"mother of the blues", stated that the blues are more than just an art
form.  From an historical standpoint, the blues have provided an avenue for
women to express anger within a social framework that defines women's anger
as mental illness, and a forum for men to express a range and depth of
emotions that otherwise would be considered "unmasculine".  In this
respect, blues artists could be considered gender outlaws.  (From the
context of the interview, it was clear that she was NOT referring to
contempory rock/blues fusion artists, but rather was referring to people
such as herself, Koko Taylor, Big Mama Thornton, Bobby "Blue" Bland, B.B.
King, Albert Collins, Buddy Guy, Albert King, Otis Clay, Muddy Waters,
Little Milton, Clarence "Gait-Mouth" Brown, etc.).

I know that students often struggle with the task of identifying research
topics and this struck me as an interesting one to pursue, particularly for
a student interested in music.  Issues surrounding race and class would
also intersect powerfully with this topic.  I have not checked, so I do not
know if the topic has already been explored.

I know that Mary Evans (at the University of Kent, at Canterbury, U.K.)
has written on the topic of changing women's studies to gender studies.

I can't find the reference on hand, perhaps someone else know where it
might be found?  It's a journal reference, so might be fouind through an

I would have him call Black feminist writer/activist Barbara Smith who is
working on the first history of African American queer communities in the
U.S.  518-437-1279.

I also think that Beverly-Guy Sheftall's book Words of Fire would be
helpful - and Beverly herself (she's at Spellman).  Darlene Clark Hine who
did the African American women's history book would be a great resource
(she's somewhere in the midwest - Michigan?)  And I think that George
Chauncey's Gay New York and Jonathan Ned Katz's books would be helpful.
 Liz Kennedy and Madeline Davis' Boots of Leather, Slipper of Gold, about
working-class dykes in Buffalo in the 40s and 50s includes African American
lesbians and talks about racial segregation and integration in that
community.

Good luck.

     Several years ago I saw a made-for-TV movie about Francis Farmer
(supposedly more or less accurate) that showed a brutal and totally
devastating lesbian rape in a mental hospital.  The rapist was the
complete stereotype of a "bull dyke" and depicted as crazy to boot.  The
rape was set-up/allowed to happen by a viscious staff person who wanted to
crush Farmer's resolve to not let the insane asylum get to her.

I dn't know if this qualifies as a text but I think Valerie Polokow's book,
Lives on the Edge, single Mothers and their Children in the Other America
is an extraordinary piece of work.  It's one of the few works on povety
that combines successfully structural analysis with an analysis of
discourse and a rich historical perspective.  I've used it in an
Introductory sociology course and in a women's studies class called Race,
Class and Sex.
Right now I'm doing research on the effects of devolution,. and we are in a
whole new and very much worse ball park, I don't know what's written yet.
Also,  look at katherine Egan's work and the Institute for Women's Policy
Research has a packet of readings on welfare.  I especially like the Egan
and Jencks article, "Do Poor Women Have the Right to Bear Children?" I hope
this helps.  If you want more ideas or discussion you can e-mail me
privately.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I'm teaching a course in the spring for the Women's Studies program called
"Growing Up Female".  I'm concentrating primarily on literary texts (e.g.,
Jane Eyre, The Bluest Eye, The Joy Luck Club and Floating in My Mother's
Palm), but I'd like also to do something from other disciplines such as
excerpts from Carol Gilligan's In a Different Voice, Nancy Chodorow,
Gilligan and Brown's (?) Meeting at the Crossroads and Mary Pipher's
Reviving Ophelia.  Since my background is in literature, however, I'm
wondering what on earth I can do with the last two texts, which are mostly
case studies.  Has anyone else worked with these or something like them?
What did you do?  How did students respond to them?  Are there any
pitfalls I should know about or particular excerpts you'd recommend?
Other texts I haven't thought of?
I'd really appreciate any suggestions!

The

 The film being referred to may be "Francis" - I've seen it many times and
don't remember a lesbian rape in the institution - rape by male
 "attendants", yes, but by women, no.

 Perhaps there is another one - specifically made for TV but there is no
lesbian bashing in the big screen version.

For a non-heteronormative take on growing up "female," i'd highly
recommend Lesley Feinberg's Stone Butch Blues.

Gilligan and her colleagues have just put out their new study,
Between Voice and Silence, Harvard University Press.

Also, you might find that using work from the field of Cultural
Studies.  Angela McRobbie is the most prominent scholar associated
with the Birmingham School, but her work is largely about British
girls.  She has done work on girls and girl's magazines like
"Jackie," for example. McRobbie recently edited the anthology _Back
To Reality_, Manchester University Press in which you'll find an
update of her earlier research as well as an article by Maria Pini,
"Women and the early British Rave Scene"  Routledge is the largest
publisher of cultural studies texts, so I'd search their website.
<http://www.thomson.com/routledge/default.html>

Cultural studies seems most suited to your discipline, but does draw
on emprirical research and case studies.  Still, the 'language' is
more in the mode of literary criticism, signification,
representation, etc.

Also, and I don't know if this is what you have
in mind, you might be interested in Susan Willis' _A Primer for Daily
Life_ which has some interested chapters.  Willis teach literature
and culture.

If I come across anything else, I'll be sure to send it on.

I hope someone on this list can help me with sources for the term
"gynogogy".  This past week-end while attending a friend's doctoral
committee meeting, I was introduced to the term, but no other information
was available.  I was told the term is being used to replace pedagogy
(education of children based on a passive-receptive model), and androgogy
(education of adults, which is grounded on earlier life experiences, but
not from a feminist perspective).

Is gynogogy different from feminist pedagogy?  It is a new term to me, and
was to others at the committee meeting.

Any information would be most appreciated.  Please reply privately.  If
there is much interest, I will forward infor to the list.
Thanks in advance.

This topic has begun to be explored by music scholars.  The Society for
Music Theory's Committee on the Status of Women has just completed a major
renovation of their online bibliography of sources related to women, gender
studies, and music.  Anyone interested in this and related topics might
want to check the bibliography for blues sources, as well as sources that
explore issues in music and gender in general.

I am just finishing up a similar course this semester.  I the PBS
documentary _Girls Like Us_ (which is great) to begin.  We read
Helena Viramontes' "Growing" and Jamaica Kincaid's "Girl" and then moved
to social science stuff, including selections from Margaret Mead,
_Nisa_, and all of Reviving Ophelia_. Students liked it
a lot, and our discussion of the text focused on what she sees as the
origin of the "crisis" that girls experience during adolescence
(illustrated, for example, in the drop in self-esteem documented in
_Shortchanging Girls, Shortchanging America_) and how she thinks it can be
averted.  About half of the semester was literature (including children's
literature) since I too am in English.

Just a thought --
I recently read a brandy new book by Joan Brumberg called "The Body
Project" which I feel very effectively places the control of
adolescent girls' bodies in a historical context.  I highly recommend
it and plan to use it next year in my Feminist Anthropology course.

Subject:      film for feminist theory
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I am looking for recommendations on a film--independent, NFB,
foreign, or hollywood--that I might incorporate into my undergraduate
course on feminist theory.  Films that are explicity feminist in some way,
and especially those that might be considered as "theory in another
medium" would be especially appreciated.

In this course, we are taking a rhetorical approach to feminist theory,
asking "what counts as feminist theory?"  "how and where is theory
produced?"  "what audience(s) do particular theories address?" "what
social goals do these theories work toward" and "what rhetorical
strategies do writers (and filmmakers?!) employ, within their specific
contexts, to achieve these effects?"

This is a 200-level course, of seminar-size, which should be primarly WS
majors and minors.

We will be reading Richardson, Taylor, & Whittier, eds.  FEMINIST
FRONTIERS IV; Lorde, SISTER OUTSIDER; and Spelman, INESSENTIAL WOMAN.

I imagine using the film toward the end of the course, after we have spent
time theorizing issues & topics such as "oppression," "socialization,"
"the body," and "resistance," and as we begin to attempt theorizing
"theory" itself.

Please post your responses to me personally (shughes@emory.edu) and I will
submit a compiled list of titles to the list if others express interest.
One or two lines of annotation--why/how it might offer a "theoretical"
perspective--would be especially useful.

Thanks in advance, for what I know will be a rich list of resources!

You may also want to investigate a book by Daphne Harrison (Afro-American
Studies Professor at the University of Maryland Baltimore County.); I
don't remember the title but think it was published in the late 1980s
about female blues singers.

There's a new book coming out by Angela Y. Davis in February: BLUES LEGACIES
AND BLACK FEMINISM: GERTRUDE "MA" RAILEY, BESSIE SMITH, AND BILLIE HOLIDAY.

I haven't seen the book yet, but it fascinating; this is from the
publisher's (Pantheon/Random House) catalog copy:

Angela Davis proposes that the tradition of popular music given voice by
"Ma" Rainey, Bessie Smith, and Billie Holiday represents a black
working-class, feminist ideology and historical consciousness that stood in
opposition to both the dominant white mainstream and the black middle class.
She uncovers within the tradition of Black women blues singers the
expression of an alternative culture and collective memory that allowed for
the musical assertion and celebration of non-middle-class, non-heterosexual
values....

        I second Lillie Ransom's suggestion.  The title of the book she's
referring to is Black Pearls: Blues Queens of the 1920s, by my colleague
Daphne Duval Harrison.  The book is available in paperback from Rutgers
University Press.

Subject:      call for papers, re:Jewish women raised by Black maids, fwd

I am forwarding this request from Judith Chalmer. Please reply to
her directly at jchalmer@norwich.edu.
Phyllis Holman Weisbard

From:    IN%"jchalmer@norwich.edu"   "Judith Chalmer"

Subject: call for papers, please post

I am interested in compiling an anthology of writing by Jewish women for
whom being raised by Black maids has become a factor in their political
awareness.  My feeling is that this is an unspoken tension for a
significant group of Jewish women, and, as all unspoken tensions are, a
dangerously unspoken tension.  I believe such a collection of thoughtfully
composed pieces, in a variety of literary genres including non-fiction,
poetry and fiction, would contribute to an appreciation of the complexities
of race, gender and class which affect all American Jews and all Americans.
 I'm hoping you can help me find ways to solicit such writing.

In particular I'm looking for recommendations to on-line newsgroups in
which I could post an announcement, word of mouth announcements and print
media in which I could place announcements.  Please feel free to forward
this message.

The experience which I bring to this project includes my own personal life
as a Jewish child in a holocaust survivor family who was brought up by a
single, professional mother and the Black maids she employed, as well as a
significant experience in dialogue among descendants of holocaust survivors
and descendants of Nazi perpetrators.  My current project has emerged in
part from listening to the ways the Germans I met discussed ways they
examine antisemitism.  I am a teacher of creative writing and women's
studies at New College of Norwich University.  My previous publications
include, most recently, a personal essay, "Violent Legacies:  Dialogues and
Possibilities" in which I explored the relevance of German-Jewish dialogue
to the ways in which women and men also live with legacies of past and
current violence.  That essay was published this fall by Haworth Press in
their anthology, CELEBRATING THE LIVES OF JEWISH WOMEN:  PATTERNS IN A
FEMINIST SAMPLER.  In addition, my own volume of poems, OUT OF HISTORY'S
JUNK JAR, was published in 1995 by Time Being Books.  My play, "Beasts,"
based on conversations with a woman who was active in the Dutch Resistance
during World War II, was given a staged reading by Lost Nation Theater in
Montpelier in 1996.  I am currently engaged in a project to create a
story-telling group for immigrants and refugees to Central Vermont.  I
would be happy to send a full resume upon request.

Since I had asked this question two years ago, let me share the info
received at the time:
Most preferrred "incoming student" instead of freshman BUT since not all
freshmen are incoming students (transfers, PT etc.) the name offered was
"frosh" or the British "fresher" OR "first-year student."
I mix and match...

Thank you for the information and discussion surrounding music & gender.  I
assumed that such an interesting topic could not have gone unnoticed
(*smile*).  However, I suspect that the male side of the issue has not been
explored in the same depth by the feminist/women's studies community, and I
believe that there is much to be learned from investigating this area as
well.

I think that it is interesting that the blues community has been far more
accepting and supportive of homosexuality and alternative gender expression
(long before Stonewall) than the mainstream music community, and society at
large.  This is particularly fascinating, given what has been written about
mainstream black community attitudes toward homosexuality.

In the interview to which I originally referred, Ruth Brown, indicated that
Little Richard had worshiped her -- tried to sound like her, right down to
trying to look like her.  Yet he wasn't merely Ruth Brown in drag.  Rather,
he took Ruth Brown in a direction that she never would have gone herself.

There used to be a very popular blues club in Chicago called the "Burning
Spear", owned and operated by Pervis Spann "the blues man", who was also a
disc jockey for WVON radio, and the brother of blues great, Otis Spann.  As
young teenagers, my friends and I regularly "snuck" (with Mr. Spann's
Knowledge) into this club, which featured all of the popular blues artists
of the time.  One of the local
artists, Wilbur "Hi-Fi" White, would periodically appear on stage wearing a
dress and make-up.  However, rather than being conceptualized by the
audience as drag or female impersonation, it was simply Wilbur "Hi-Fi"
White being himself,
decidedly male, proudly gay (before it was popular to be so).

On a visit to San Francisco a couple of years ago, a group of friends took
me out to one of the new wave, gender-bending night spots that they
described as "cutting edge".  What?  I found very little innovative about
it at all (*smile*).  These individuals obviously knew nothing about the
Chicago Blues scene, which by the way, was also connected fairly strongly
to the gay male "Ball" scene.  Much of what I saw in this San Francisco
club, I had seen 30 years before at the Burning Spear!

I used a bit of Mary Pipher's work this semester in a large (90+ students)
course on families.  I showed a video (from C-SPAN) of Pipher addressing
a group on "teenage girls and the media".  The video illustrates nicely the
perspective from which she comes.  It demonstrates her considerable skill
as a storyteller and also reveals her biases.  The video generated a lot of
discussion (more than I thought it would) as my students were not familiar
with her work and were excited to talk about it.

The video is available from C-SPAN ($19.95 ?) .  If you go to their web-site
you can actually listen to it before buying it.

I don't mean to start anything, here, but I am concerned about the use of
the term "lesbian" to name all female same-sex rapes.

The original post asked for examples of "rapes of lesbians by lesbians."
This, I think, might be a different category (with overlap, naturally)
than same-sex rape in a prison or even a hospital setting.

I don't know if this applies in women's prisons or not, but in the men's
prisons I have taught for, there seems to be a distinction drawn between
"gay" or "homosexual" men and men who are using sex with other men for
some power-related reasons.  Another example of the possible differences
between same-sex rape and homosexual/gay/lesbian rape might be the rape of
male children by self-identified heterosexual adult men.

I am not suggesting that the rape of lesbians by lesbians never happens; I
am, however, quite uncomfortable with the blending of this category with
other situations.

Take care, everyone,
Jeannie

Subject:      name that movie...
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hi everyone -- I'm trying to think of the name of the movie that came out
a year or two ago, foreign language film, a sort of cynical follow-up to
"A Question of Silence" (by the same film maker), about a woman who
returns, with her adult daughter, to her home village just as her mother
is dying.  I say it is a cynical follow-up because the woman who made the
both films said that the second one was basically an expression of her
giving up on the possibility of radical change.

So, can anybody out there name that movie?  I'm trying to give the title
to someone else to possibly include in a course, and it is driving me nuts.

Thanks for any help!

as "freshlings."  I'm not yet sure if this term is an endearment (!) that
the teachers use with each other in a closed discussion (such as the
list) or one they use with the first-year students themselves.

I think you're talking about Antonia's Line - but I didn't read it as cynical.

Subject:    name that movie...

Hi everyone -- I'm trying to think of the name of the movie that came out
a year or two ago, foreign language film, a sort of cynical follow-up to
"A Question of Silence" (by the same film maker), about a woman who
returns, with her adult daughter, to her home village just as her mother
is dying.  I say it is a cynical follow-up because the woman who made the
both films said that the second one was basically an expression of her
giving up on the possibility of radical change.

So, can anybody out there name that movie?  I'm trying to give the title
to someone else to possibly include in a course, and it is driving me nuts.

Thanks for any help!

For questions like "name that movie", a useful reference is the
Internet Movie Databse (IMDb)
http://us.imdb.com/

A quick search on the title ":Question of Silence" takes you to a
page on the film, plus links to the directors, then to the
filmography, or the actors, producers, etc.

Perhaps I'm misreading you, but in the above lines there seems to be
an implication that gay or homosexual men don't rape, and that the men
who use sex for "power-related reasons" are necessarily not gay or
homosexual, i.e., are necessarily heterosexual.  Is this what you
meant to say and, if so, I wonder what evidence there is for this in
the case of men in prison.

Re:  25th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade Satellite Teleconference

The Center for Reproductive Law and Policy would like to invite your school to
participate in an exciting teleconference that will mark our second annual
Blackmun Lecture on Privacy.

On Wednesday, January 21, 1998 the program "Roe Turns 25" will be broadcast
live via satellite from 3 - 4:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time on a "C" band
satellite.

The goal of Roe Turns 25 is to engage the next generation of legal advocates
in a conversation about the constitutional and American values embodied in
Roe v. Wade; to discuss the historical events that led to the decision; and
to analyze the Court's rulings since the decision.

Justice Harry Blackmun will be participating, making it a truly historical
event.

The broadcast will be interactive with four law schools -- New York
University School of Law, the University of Chicago Law School, Stanford Law
School, and Emory University School of Law, where participants will be able
to ask questions during the panel discussion.  In addition to these schools,
to date over 35 universities and law schools around the country will view the
program live via satellite.  (The progarm will also be broadcast on the
American Law Network.)

The program will feature Justice Harry Blackmun and a panel discussion with
experts including CRLP founder and president Janet Benshoof, Emory University
Professor of Law David Garrow, and American Public Heath Association
past-president Dr. Helen Rodriguez-Trias. The program will be moderated by
journalist and writer Anna Quindlen.

Following the broadcast, several schools are organizing panels featuring
local experts to respond to the points made in the program and to give
participants an opportunity to ask questions.

The first step in bringing this program to your campus is determining your
satellite downlinking capabilitiy.  Once you have confirmed that your school
is able to downlink the program, you need to reserve a room that can view
this feed (usually on a projection screen with audio).  After the room has
been
reserved, start promoting the event to professors and student groups that
would have an interest.  Another way to build turn-out is to organize a local
panel of experts to respond after the program.

If for some reason your school is able to receive the satellite feed but
cannot broadcast the feed live into a room that is available, you can request
permission from the Center to tape the program and show the tape later.

If you have any questions or would like more information, please call Amber
Khan at 202-530-2975 or email CLRPDC@aol.com

(Please forward to interested parties)

Subject:      seeking recommendation on civic women program series
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

I write to ask advice, especially for a possible kick-off speaker, for a
series of programs my university is planning for September 1998 here in
Topeka, Kansas. We are now in the process of writing a Humanities grant to
fund a series of 5 2-hour discussion programs, all focusing on the
changing roles of women in local civic activities. Basically, the idea is
to bring together the whole spectrum of women currently involved in any
kind of voluntary civic behavior, and talk about women's past, current,
and future roles in civic activities.

For our kickoff program, we would like to find a well-established academic
who studies American women's changing civic roles (preferably including a
sense of likely future directions), and who is also an effective public
speaker. As of now, we are thinking of about a $1500 speakers fee, plus
travel expenses, for the person brought in to kick off the series. If s/he
would also be willing to speak to some classes or community groups the day
of the presentation, we can probably add about $500 more from campus
lecture funds.

I will be grateful for all recommendations of possible speakers, either
sent to the list, or to me personally at:

    zztuck@washburn.edu

I also would very much like to hear any other recommendations or comments
any of you might make on this topic, especially from any one with
experience with this kind of program. I'm also looking for recommended
readings on the topic, particularly ones suitable for a list to be given
out to the general public (short, readable, etc).

I too have a problem with the idea of generalizing rape statistics from a
sample of violent offenders.  There is some good literature on female
same-sex battering out there.  Here ia a very good title.

 NAMING THE VIOLENCE: Speaking Out
                   About Lesbian Battering

Sorry - have forgotten the author, but there is also a reference section
in the back.

An Urgent Letter to the Academic Community:
How Coursepacks and Photocopying Affect Small Presses

Dear Faculty and Students:

We know from copy centers and custom coursepack providers that our texts
remain a vital and integral part of your courses--not only women's studies
courses but also courses on literature, teaching, history, cultural and
American studies. We thank you for using our work but feel compelled to
explain how using photocopied versions of our work impacts on us financially.
We are writing to urge you, whenever possible, to assign and buy books.

Small not-for-profit publishers like The Feminist Press struggle to make ends
meet. The last decade has seen an industry-wide decline in sales of books for
course use; among those who have been hit hardest by this decline have been
the small presses.  One of the factors that has contributed to declining book
sales is the increased prevalence of coursepacks. Over the past two years we
have seen a dramatic increase not only in photocopy permission requests but
also in the amount of material that is being copied. We have had to rethink
our permission and reprint policy to protect and to better serve the interests
of the press and its authors. We cannot allow substantial or central parts of
our texts to be copied. Such large grants of permission undercut sales of our
books. In the end they also do not seem in the students  best interests. When
copy charges are added to the royalty that publishers charge, purchasing the
book is nearly as affordable--or even more affordable. Purchasing also gives
students the added satisfaction of owning a nicely bound, durable book, with
all the context material that Feminist Press editions typically include. We
believe that if faculty members were to carefully consider these costs and
other factors, they might more often choose to assign complete texts whenever
possible.

What can you do to help?

Buy books! The best way to support and ensure the survival of small presses is
to buy our books and assign them in your courses. Such support will enable
presses like The Feminist Press to continue to publish less commercial books,
and, over the years, will also enable us to keep these books available and
affordable. The founding of The Feminist Press was inspired by the need for a
wider range of important books by women for use as classroom texts. We can
continue to survive and grow only as long as the market for our books endures.


Please share this news with your colleagues. If you're a teacher, impress upon
your students that, by buying books, they are supporting a small press, and
that the purchase of such books does have a direct effect on publishing--and
the future of independent presses and what we can publish.

And stay in touch. Let us know how you teach and with what supplements. Let us
know what materials might be added to help teach about our work. We welcome
your input, and rely on your support.

With thanks.

WOMEN'S STUDIES QUARTERLY
An Educational Project of The Feminist Press at The City University of New
York in Cooperation with Rochester Institute of Technology

Call for Papers

Women and the Environment
Edited by Diane Hope and Vandana Shiva

Since 1972 Women's Studies Quarterly has been the leading journal on teaching
in women's studies. Thematic issues feature vital material for specialists and
generalists alike, including the most recent scholarship available in
jargon-free language; classroom aids such as course syllabi; discussions of
strategies for teaching; and up-to-date, complete bibliographies as well as
hard-to-find or never-before-published documents and literary materials. The
intersections of race and class with gender are of special concern, as are
international perspectives.
    Women's Studies Quarterly is now inviting submissions for a special
spring/summer 2000 issue on Women and the Environment. Articles, syllabi,
pedagogical essays, bibliographies, biographies, fiction, poetry, and
black-and-white art are welcome. Suggested areas of focus include, but are not
limited to, feminist analysis of environmental issues; collective and
individual work by women on environmental problems and solutions; reports of
environmental issues with particular impact on women; biographical sketches;
personal stories; conference and organizational reports; and relevant artwork.
Manuscripts primarily focused on issues most pertinent to the United States
should be sent to Professor Diane Hope, Rochester Institute of Technology,

I find myself agreeing with Daphne Patai on this one: sloppy research does
nobody any good. Generalizations are deadly.
But while I believe that rape is a power&control, not a sex thing, and
this goes for rapists of any gender and orientation, I frankly have a hard
time extrapolating from prison rape to (for lack of a better term) in-the-
community rape.
And I have an even harder time accepting "rape" and "battering" as
synonymous--again, no matter what the gender and orientation of those
involved.
Once we get the terminology down, maybe we can proceed with the
methodology...

In response to Daphne Patai's question, I have no systematic evidence, but
can report anecdotally.  In 1970, as the result of an anti-war
demonstration, I got the chance to spend several months in prison and
observe the prison culture first-hand.  On the basis of that experience, I
can report that, among the veteran inmate population, at least, men who
raped other men did not consider _themselves_ gay, but considered those
whom they raped to be gay.  It seemed to me at the time that this was a
way of easing the cognitive dissonance between homophobia and sexual
desire in a same-sex environment.  (I doubt if 'desire' is the right word
there, but am too rushed to think of a better one).

I don't mean to single Stacey out, but I just wanted to let the entire
list know that my original query was for books, articles, videos,
brochures, etc. that addressed the issue of lesbians who are raped by other
lesbians.  The therapist at the local rape crisis center asked me for
materials that might help a client who has been in this situation, a
lesbian acquaintance rape.  I didn't mean for this to turn into a
discussion of statistics, samples, etc.  I also noted that the therapist
and I have all the resources on lesbian relationship violence that we
needed.  The rape in question did not take place in a relationship
context.

Moreover, (re: Daphne Patai's post) anyone who would suggest that lesbians
or gay men cannot/do not rape is just not in touch with the research and
the information gathered at rape crisis centers, etc.

I am gathering from the paucity of resources that lesbian-on-lesbian rape
(for lack of a better term) is an unexplored area of study/resource
building. This would be a fruitful area for new research. Am I wrong?

Thanks to everyone who has replied.

Exactly.
To add my two cents worth, I also think it is very dangerous to label rape
of men by men as "gay" rape. Rape, as is well documented, is a crime of
power, not of sexuality or desire. What I've read of prison rape often makes
the same distinction that John Berg makes, above. In prisons, as well as
other enforced sex-segregated situations (such as the military).

My father's descriptions of rape in the Navy (during WWII on ships in the
Pacific) also verifies this pattern. In the situations he described, neither
perpetrators nor victims were anything but avowedly heterosexual. It was
simply (sorry, now that's the wrong word!) a matter of horny men with power
getting their rocks off on anyone they could overpower. In non-sex
segregated situations, the chosen victim  is usually female. When there are
no women available (ie prisons, military) a man "of less power" (ie,
smaller, slender, less "masculine", or simply lacking membership in a gang
for protection) is used.  In both situations, the one who is raped is
despised and is then further victimized by the stigma of having been raped.
In women, that's the women who are then labeled whores, driven from homes or
villages, and/or punished by family and society. As John points out, male
victims of rape in the prison he experienced are "considered to be gay". But
this use of the word "gay" is a condemnation, an intended insult and a
further victimization, not a self-identification. It is inappropriate to
consider male  victims of rape to be "gay" unless they so self-identify.
(And, even if they do self-identify as gay in other situations, I would
question the motive or value in identifying the victims as gay. ie, is there
an implication that it's more "OK" to rape a gay man than a straight man or
that gays are somehow inclined to rape/be raped, etc..)

To call power-rape among men, or to label the victims of the same as "gay"
is totally inappropriate. Further, it contributes to the stereotyper that
gay people are rapists (and from there it's only a small step to the
stereotype that gay people are child-abusers.) All of which is very costly
to our society.

I would also add that the common-culture usage of "gay" to describe
male/male rape misplaces a tremendous amount of anger on gay men and on
lesbians. I would very much like to see some study of the effects of this
and if/when/how it results in "random" violence against gay men and
lesbians, for example

By the same token, I am also very concerned about the bandying about of the
concept "lesbian rape." I hope that the appropriate analysis of power (and
lack of) are being addressed by people looking at this subject. In fact, I'm
a bit confused by this discussion. Are we talking documented cases, looking
for research, or wondering if it happens? Again, my question is, are we
talking same-sex rape or something that occurs between two lesbians that
might appropriately be described as-rape in which "lesbian" is a descriptive
characteristic of perpetrators or victims, rather than as an adjective to
the crime?

I apologize if I'm going off inappropriate  on this whole topic. I don't
mean to suggest that gay men never rape other gay men, nor that sexual abuse
and power crimes cannot occur between lesbian or other women, or that this
research should not be discussed on the list.

But I do think that care must be taken not to contribute to anti-gay
stereotypes in the course of  researching and discussing male violence
against other men or violence among women.

To speak personally to this topic, my father's hatred of all things gay was
quite explicitly rooted in his experience in WWII on Navy ships either
seeing friends be raped or, quite possibly, of having been raped himself,
and learning to define this experience of male violence as "gay." It was an
anger and a prejudice that lasted for four decades and, to say the least, it
was not pretty. It was acted-out upon many, many gay people, probably
hundreds, as well as at least a few straight people, over those decades,
including immediate family. The long-term consequences of labeling male to
male rape as "gay", in at least this one situation, were very far-reaching
and significant. As I said earlier , I would very much like to see research
on the consequences generated by this mis-naming.

Well this has always been a concern of mine, this distinction between
sexuality/desire and power.  I hope someone can clear it up for me
or, at least, give me some thoughts to mull over.  Why, if rape is
not about sexuality/desire, is it that people rape others rather
than, say, beating them up?  I assume that the rapist wouldn't get
the same 'satisfaction' (can't think of a better word).  It just
seems to me that rape as a form over exercising power and domination
over another person is, at the very least, bound up with sexual
desire in some rather significant ways.  I don't know where I stand
on this issue and, certainly, for educative purposes, I'd rather make
a strategic distinction between sexuality and power.  I would also be
interested in the documentation you refer to--things to add to my
"I'll read this someday" list :-)

I understand what men and women mean when they say that rape is a crime of
power, but I don't understand how that rules out sexuality or desire?  Why
do so many feminists acknowledge the power issues and discount (can't think
of a better term at the moment) the sexual aspects?

Any book recommendations on feminists who hold the same views as me?  I
would guess Andrea Dworkin might not seperate out the power issues from the
sexual issues, but I'm not sure.

Hi all,
    I don't think we can so easily (nor do I think it is productive to)
separate "power&control" from the "sex thing" when talking about rape.
It is my understanding that when heterosexual men rape women, power and
control (even violence and the desire to humiliate and terrify) are
eroticized, that this is fundamental to the turn-on (and the reward of
rape), and therefore, in the case of heterosexual rape, cannot be
separated from the sex act, or the desire and eroticism the attacker
maybe "enjoying" by exercising power and control. (Diana Scully:
"Understanding Sexual Violence: a Study of Convicted Rapists. 1990")
    That "power" and "dominance" is also eroticized and often part of the
sexual "play" in consensual heterosexual relationsions helps to confuse
the line between date-rape and consensual sex. In some cases it may be a
case of inexcusably poor communication skills. In other cases it may be
the man is "pretending" to misunderstand, while "getting off" on
overpowering his "date."
    I haven't read any of the research on male on male prison rape, but it
seems like a fair guess that if cultural and personal misogyny feeds
into the erotization of male on female rape, then maybe cultural and
personal homophobia could feed into the erotization of male on male
rape. (After all, if the rapist claims to be an otherwise heterosexual
man, not turned on by men, how does he explain the erection with which
he raped his victim unless he is sexually aroused by raping? In this
case he is aroused by the raping, overpowering, hurting and humiliating
of a man he perceives to be "gay.")
    I originally became interested in this string of posts because I find
it so difficult to imagine a woman raping a woman (of any orientation.)
The erotization of power and control is pretty much monopolized by men
and masculinity in our culture. Lesbian butchness may look like
masculinity, but it is not masculinity. It just doesn't operate the
same.
    Jaime Grant mentioned the prevalence of heterosexually identified men
raping and sexually abusing boys, and I think two more things should be
clarified here. 1. Women rarely perpetrate sexualized violence against
children. In the rare cases that a woman is the perpetrator in incest
cases (2% - 4%), she is almost always very, very mentally disturbed. It
makes sense to me we could also expect to find a very low prevalence of
female adult sexual violence. 2. A homosexual act does not a homosexual
person make. :) A male raping a male may be a homo sexual violent act,
but that does not make either of the two men gay identified, nor does
the act implicate any "gay cultural problems." Woman on woman sexual
violence may happen, but we should be careful think about the how they
sexually identify. There _may_ be some "lesbian" rape in lesbian
domestic violence situations, but I wouldn't call a woman on woman
sexual assault in prison or "on the outside" lesbian rape if the
perpetrator was a heterosexually identified woman.

Yes, Andrea Dworkin and Catharine MacKinnon both argue that rape is about
sexuality as a form of violence.  I understand the strategic distinction
in a context where feminists were trying to argue that rape was not about
men's unbridled desire.  However, the separation of rape as power from
sexuality assumes that there is some "real" sexuality that exists apart
from various social forms, both good and bad.

Carol comments that it's "well documented" that rape is about "power,
not desire."  Of course we have all "known" this, and heard it
declared as axiomatic, for well over 20 years now.  But, nonetheless,
I wonder how an interpretation, an imputation of attitude
or psychological states, can be "documented" simply as if it were an
empirical fact.  That rape may sometimes be about power, especially in
situations such as prisons, I have no trouble believing. That it may
also be about revenge, hatred, fury, whatever, I also accept. But that
it is, by definition, always about power and never about desire, that
I can't help doubting.  I don't know of too many human actions that
can so simply and categorically be attributed to one and only one motivation,
especially when that motivation--in this case the word "power"--in
fact involves layers of complexity, as, indeed, does the word desire.
The interesting  question then becomes: what has this particular
interpretation, once it becomes an orthodoxy, do for the young women
who learn it through women's studies courses? What does it do for
feminism? What is its function? What does it help us accomplish?
And at what cost?--

I appreciate the distinction made here about the difference between
sexuality/rape and power/domination.  It seems important to call rape in
any situation a need to dominate, manipulate, and control, and to reclaim
the term power for what it really means -- to have ability, potential.
As long as we continue to interchange the terms power with control/
dominance/ and manipulation, we will never be able to claim fully our own
power or appreciate fully the potential of others.

Thanks for all the info on NOW although I still did not find out anything
about work by Mary Payer after 1977.  I have one more question which this
community might find easier to deal with.  I have read from time to time
papers and books about interracial "passing."  Does anyone know of an analysis
of this process from the perspective of how one identifies oneself versus
how others identify us?  Thanks in advance.  Rhoda Unger

On the issue of power and desire, Jessica Benjamin's *Bond of Love:
Psychoanalysis, Feminism, and the Problem of Domination* provides some
insights. While she interrogates the male/female domination/submission
paradigms, she also discusses how desire acts as a lubricant (so to speak)
in power relationships or expressions of power and submission.

Hi Daphne,
Of course, when I re-read this paragraph as an entity in itself, it might
seem to be saying what you suggest it might.  I was using the incidence of
male-male rape in prisons as an example of same-sex sexual violence that
is not necessarily the same thing as gay/homosexual rape.  Right before
the quoted section, I expressed my opinion that lesbian (or gay or
homosexual) rape would be a different category than rape in prisons or
hospitals.  At that time, I did express that I thought these two
categories would have overlap (read: situations which would fit into
both).  And immediately after the quoted section, I expressed that I was
not suggesting that lesbian-lesbian rape does not exist (and I do not
believe that homosexual male rape does not exist, either).  I am simply
uncomfortable with using prison- and hospital-setting rapes as examples of
lesbian (or gay) rapes.  I think subsequent postings from others have
helped clarify the distinctions I was seeing.  I'm sorry my original post
was not clearer.  It is final exam week here and my brain is tired.


And while I'm here, I think it is a sign of how uncomfortable we might be
with the idea of lesbian rape (a self-identifying lesbian raping another
woman/lesbian) that we want to discuss it in terms of extraordinary
contexts (prisons and hospitals).  The original poster has said to us that
a lesbian in her region was raped by another lesbian, not in an
incarceration setting, apparently not in the context of a violent
relationship (or a relationship at all).  This is what she wants to know
about.

I'll bet it _is_ a relatively ignored phenomenon for many reasons: because
social services are still administered in the context of a terribly
heterosexist society; because it is un(der)reported for many of the same
reasons that all rapes are underreported.  But I also suspect (and all
this is conjecture on my part) very strongly that lesbian rape is
understudied because of the fear that focusing on it would draw negative
stereotypes to all lesbians (even more that they put up with now).

This fear would add to the lack of reporting by lesbians (if I report
this, my entire community will be stigmatized) and to a lack of safe
venues in which to report.  It would also be one factor in the lack of
studies from a feminist perspective, I would guess.

Better stop rambling.  Sorry this is so long.
Jeannie

Subject:      Re: Rape and sexuality (was Re: rape and prison)

I would like to add to this discussion that I think it is incorrect for
feminists to assume that rape is divorced from sexuality. We live
in a society where women and men use the same word, sex, but construct them
in very different ways. As someone who studies pornogprahy, a manual for
the "modern" man, it is clear that sex and power for men are symbolically
and emotionally linked. In pornogprahy, there is no such thing as sex outside
of power. All representaions encode power as the element that makes sex sexy.
To assume that men can live in this culture, intenralize the images, and
define themsleves as male in relation to these representaions, and still
see sex as divorced from power, is to ignore the enormous impact
that images have on the social construction of masculine sexuality. Rape
is the best form of sex in pornogprahy, it is what distinguishes the
men from the boys, the guys from the whimps, the males from the females.
And what self-respecting man wants to be a woman? Gail Dines. Whe_Dines&flo.org

In September, I submitted a request to the list for placement
statistics for gender studies/women's studies graduates in order to
include them in a proposal to various state boards for a new gender
studies major at the University of Texas at Dallas.  I received
numerous requests to post a summary of results to the list.  This is it.

There are not a lot of programs that keep detailed records, although
many people offered examples of the kinds of placements graduates
typically choose (graduate and professional schools, law, activist
organizations and non-profits, corporate affirmative action programs,
personnel & human resources, artists, social work, teaching, women's
health, media)


Best published source:  Barbara Luebke and Mary Ellen Reilly, _Womens

This response is inspired in its subversion!  It's right up there with
Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson sending out queries to
heterosexually-identified feminists asking them to write a short essay on
how their heterosexuality contributes to their feminist politics and/or
their feminist psychology.  Because most had been indoctrinated with the
orthodoxy that heterosexuality is oppressive to feminism, they simply could
not envision heterosexuality having any positive role in, particularly
informing, their feminist politics and/or feminist psychology.  Of course,
this WAS the editors' point!  According to the two of them, who wrote me
very nice letters in response to my review of their book, I was the ONLY
academic so far to have gotten the point and publicly stated so.  I lament
that few will get your point below, and a majority will probably label you
divisive, as they did Kitzinger and Wilkinson.

Daphne, you and others have made similar comments about the term power in
in relationship to rape, sexual practices in various settings, and contol.
I appreciate the questions posed:

One cost/consequence that occurs to me is that if we continue to equate
terms like power with terms like control, dominance, domination, and
manipulation, we ourselves will never be fully free to embrace our own
power or fully honor expressions of empowerment by others.  That seems an
important question to address in a women's studies context, regardless of
the sexual dimensions of the situation.  Power is about claiming one's
ability, striving to reach one's potential, and providing conditions which
empower others to do the same.  Control, domination, and manipulation are
about restrictions on other's efforts to fulfill their potential.

Feminist theologians from diverse cultures and continents, among others,
have been at the forefront of challenging the equation of control and
domination with power, and calling for a fuller appreciation of the
potential within each of us to be power-full.

The Burke Library of Union Theological Seminary is currently planning the
"Archive of Women in Theological Scholarship (AWTS)."  The AWTS will preserve
the personal papers, records, correspondents, unpublished scholarly and
religious documentation of those women theologians who have shaped theological
and religious scholarship since the 1960s.  The Burke Library seeks to include
those scholars who have been faculty members, alumnae, and associated
colleagues of Union Theological Seminary, NY.  The AWTS will be the first
archive in the United States with an exclusive focus on women theologians.

Once established, the AWTS will be located in the Burke Library.  Each
collection will be arranged and described according to established archival
guidelines, with a finding aid for accessing each collection.  The collections
will be catalogued in the major bibliographic databases to make them
accessible for researchers.  A special stipend program for researchers may be
created.

During this initial planning phase we are seeking to identify women scholars
who are interested in participating in the AWTS.  Since the library does not
have an extra funding line for building the AWTS, we are depending on private
donations to fund the project.

Many of the women scholars whom we have in mind might contact your "Network."
Would you consider the possibility to forward this message to your members as
they might be interested in hearing about the planned AWTS?  We will
appreciate your support.

If anybody would like to receive further information about the AWTS or to
support the project, please contact the staff of the Burke Library: Andrew

An interesting project, to connect feminist theorizing texts with literary
text!
    It might be useful to read the books you mention in comparison to
Chodorow's thesis. She claims there's a universal phenomenon: gender
psyches are constructed by their mothers in very early childhood, such that
all mothers create their daughters' desire for intimate relationships and
impel sons to avoid intimacy as a feminine characteristic. Students might
be asked to consider whether and how the thesis is consistent with the
experience of the women in the novels read in the course, Jane Eyre, Bluest
Eye and so on - and if there's no correspondence, why not? Is the theory
wrong? different context, events emerging in the women's lives? What kind
of theory do the novelists seem to propose?

is a historical look at women in math/statistics/experimental as it applies
to psychology.  I want to find out what math achievements by women have
contributed--and in what way--to the scientific study of human behavior
(which may cross into several disciplines, including anthropology,
biological and other sciences), accomplishments of women in the actual
fields of experimental and statistical psychology, and what psychometric
prinicples in use today are directly tied to accomplishments by women.

My thesis work on test development has sparked an interest in the
psychometric end of psychology, but I am wholly ignorant of women's role in
this area.  To date, less than a handful of women's work have been quoted
in my stats/experimental text, but Bruni assures me that there is a
plethora of accomplishments to be found.

One of my mentors, Judy Long, used to have us do research on women
scholars who'd been marginalized or completely left out of the
'canon' in sociology.  It was a really terrific project, eye
opening even as a jaded grad student.  So I want to do a variation
of this in my Intro Women's Studies course.  Judy called these
women our 'feminist foremothers' even though they may not have
labeled themselves feminists or conceived of their work as feminist.
 I'm largely familiar with only names associated with sociology and
social theory.  So I was hoping that I could solicit names  of women
in other disciplines.

Thanks for your help.

As Joan so often reminds us, the list exists for issues relating to
teaching and research in women's studies, not for general feminist
discussion.  In any teaching or research about rape and sexuality, I would
question such sweeping generalizations as these made by Gail Dine:
[quote] We live in a society where women and men use the same word, sex,
but construct them in very different ways. As someone who studies
pornogprahy, a manual for
>the "modern" man, it is clear that sex and power for men are symbolically
>and emotionally linked. [end quote]
These statements deny both of the experience and practice of many men, who
do not use pornography as "a manual" or in any other way, and the
experience and practice of some women, who do symbolically link sex and
power---gross simplification of complex issues is not good theory and does
not lead to good pedagogy.

I agree with several of the postings (beginning, if I remember correctly,
with Daphne's) about the possible disservice we might be doing our
students if we teach the line that "rape is a crime of power, not
sexuality or desire."  It seems to me that the analyses of how power is
culturally associated with both desire and desirability, especially for
men (women are taught that powerful men are more desirable; we may not
maintain this belief throughout our lives, but many of us grow up to fight
with it), are right on in terms of explaining how the power/sex division
is untenable when we think about the rapist.

My primary concern, however, is with the victims/survivors.  When we talk
about rape in class, one of my students invariably brings up the power/sex
delineation.  This has always made me uncomfortable.  As a rape survivor,
I can tell you that being raped affected _both_ my sense of personal
empowerment _and_ my sexuality.  I have never met a rape survivor whose
sexual life has not been changed dramatically by her or his experience.

Now, when one of my students brings up that old line, I bring out the
examinations of the cultural constructions of desire and how "power" (or
perceived power) plays into our cultural notions (which are, of course,
much different than many of our personal notions) about what is "sexy" or
"desirable."  We talk about the "romantic stranger" and the cultural
notion that love begins with being "swept away" (or carried off).  And I
use Gail Dines research in this discussion.  It is my perception that she
is writing about the cultural constructions of these ideas and how they
influence individual lives.  Even men who never use pornography are
affected by its pull on our society, if only to the degree that they can
be stereotyped as "strange" or "uptight."  (And it certainly doesn't have
to be "porn"--the cultural construction of power [usually of _abuse_ of
power] as sexy is evident in porn, advertising, movies, TV shows, tabloid
stories, as well as in the lives of many people whom I know.)

Thanks to all who have referenced other sources which talk about rape as a
sexual crime.

V. Woolf Conf. Call for Papers

    The Eighth Annual Virginia Woolf Conference will be held at Saint
Louis University, June 4 - 7, 1988.  The conference theme will be Virginia
Woolf and Communities.  The definition of community is deliberately left
general.  Presentations may address communities of which Virginia Woolf
was a part--for example, FEmale Modernists, the Memoir Group, the
Bloomsbury community, the feminist commuity, communities of artists, the
pacifist community--or not a part--for example, the Apostles, the working
class.  Presenters may analyze communities that Woolf describesin her
writings.  Focus may be on texual communities inside or ouside the spheres
in which Woolf is generally explored--the Harlem Renaissance, Socialism.
Community may be interpreted as national, geographical, pedagogical,
sexual, gendered, ideological, economic, racial, cultural, colonial,
post-colonial.  Community need not be restricted to Woolf's own era; a
presentation of future, current, or past communities in terms of Woolf
would be appropriate--for example, evaluating current communities of
critics (Woolf and autobiography studies, Woolf and lesbian studies).

    Proposals for papers must include: one cover page, with name and
address, institutional affiliations (if any), phone numbers, title of
individual paper; and 15 copies of a one-page, 250-word abstract.
Envisioned papers should adhere to 15 minute reading time.

The argument that "gays/lesbians rape, too" is often used to reinforce
negative gay stereotypes, as Carol pointed out. It is also sometimes used
as evidence that rape is not caused by social conditioning but rather is
either 1) "just human nature" or 2) a deviant act that departs from the
norms of our society, whether the perp is gay or straight.

Does our society have a history of celebrating egalitarian sex,
sex between true social equals? Nope. Our society cries "vive la
difference" and gets homophobic when gender differences are minimized or
reversed. Does our society still celebrate sexual acts as a form of
conquest? Of course. Bedpost notches are not yet a thing of the past.

So I say, yes, rape is about power, not about sexual desire--as I
understand the latter concept. And society plays a role in promoting
rape-compatible definitions and forms of sexual desire and deglamorizing
or punishing other alternative definitions and forms of sexual desire. A
rape counselor explained a rapist's motives to me as follows: rape, like a
curse, is a way to release aggression. So is sex, alas, as some people
define it--though of course not everyone who defines sex in this way will
go so far as to engage in violent or coersive non-consensual sex. Rape is
like acting out the expression, "Fuck you." Again, so is sex, as some
people define it.

It's true that heterosexual non-rape still sometimes relies on
power differentials, coersion and artificially heightened sexual
differences as aphrodesiacs. I imagine this might have to do (at least in
some cases) with homophobic uneasiness about sex between similars/equals.
Role playing seems fine to me, as long as it's pleasurable and voluntary,
not forced upon one by society, one's partner, one's church, one's
parents, one's superego, one's therapist, etc. Finally, in my opinion, the
incorporation of stuff like conquest and dehumanization/objectification
into non-rape sex in our society doesn't mean that rape is a sexual act.
It means that sex--gay or straight--might be sexier (more fun, varied and
subtle) in rape-free, non-homophobic circles.

resource people and Site Coordiantors to set up visits and presentations.
Major travel arr angements will be made by the Antioch Education Abroad.

During the program, the Director's focus is on the students and their
assimilation and integration of the resources available to them.  Careful
attention is given to group dynamics at all stages of the program.
Interpersonal and cross-cultural skills are highly valued here as they

I'll be teaching an intro to Women's Studies course in the fall, the first for
our university, and the first for me.  I've found the online information,
including this list's archives, extremely helpful.  I've read through all of
the syllabi available in the archive, and I notice that having students keep
journals is common to Intro courses, as are papers and projects.  I'm used
to assigning papers, but I'd like more information about the projects some of
you may use in your Intro courses (since the syllabi don't specify what is
required in these projects).  I would love suggestions about projects that
have worked well for you experienced Women's Studies teachers.

Thanks so much for any help!

Barry M. Dank and Roberto Refinetti, eds., SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND
SEXUAL CONSENT, Transaction Publications, 1997.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND SEXUAL CONSENT  represents the premier volume of
SEXUALITY AND CULTURE.   This edited volume  contains two editorials,
five essays, three empirical articles and several book reviews/essays.
It is 309 pages.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND CONSENT focuses on sexual harassment/consent
issues in academia and represents a much needed alternative to the
literature on sexual harassment which is predominantly feminist based.
For example,  a number of articles critique the dominant feminist
perspective put forth in THE LECHEROUS PROFESSOR  which is that all
student-professor relationships cannot be consensual and therefore
represent harassment. This perspective has led to the implementation
of many fraternization bans on American  campuses.  The
following articles in this volume represent a major critique of the
banning position: Klaus de Alberquerque, "`Academia's Dirty Little
Secret': Deconstructing the Sexual Harassment Hysteria"; Barry M. Dank
and Joseph S Fulda, "Forbidden Love: Student-Professor Romances;" Peg
Tittle, "On Prohibiting Relationships Between Students and Professors,"
and  Daphne Patai, "The Making of a Social Problem: Sexual Harassment on
Campus."

Other articles focus on sexual harassment issues in a Canadian
university; in a South African university and on sexual harassment
issues in work settings in general. In addition, articles cover
such subjects as college drinking norms; feminist rape reform proposals;
and evolutionary psychology perspectives on mating strategies.  An
extensive annotated bibliography dealing with assault by women on their
spouses is also presented.

Many of the editors of SEXUALITY AND CULTURE and the contributors to
this volume are major critics in North America of political and sexual
correctness issues, e.g. Daphne Patai, Cathy Young, John Fekete, John
Furedy, Louis Marinoff and Warren Farrell.  Warren Farrell functions as
the SEXUALITY AND CULTURE film editor/critic. For a complete listing of
the editors and contents of volume 1, go to the SEXUALITY AND CULTURE

I am looking for suggestions for a film that would provide a vivid,
provocative representation of women's institutionalized oppression in its
"interlocking" layers, for an intro to ws class.  I plan to show Still
Killing Us Softly, to get the class rolling on discussing sexism, sexist
messages etc.  And I have films planned that cover specific issues:
dieting, violence, etc.  I have been racking my brain trying to find a
film that would present a more general view of the various layers of
institutionalized oppression.  I watched the Handmaid's Tale and Stepford
wives hoping for a good distopian film, but feel that these are too
limited, for various reasons...
any suggestions?

thanks,

Some fun projects that I use:
collect sexist ads/analyze; make collage with sexist ads/ write over
collage or underneath with some text that sums up message

analysis of housework/summary as practiced in home of family, past or present

I have a different question for list-makers regarding Intro to women's
studies:
What are your strategies for introducing the concept of power into
discussion?  In other words, students seem to accept the idea that ads,
the media etc, promote specific gender meanings/stereotypes.  they even
accept that these meanigns are damaging, to both women and men.  How do
you teach students that men, although damaged in some ways by gender
"roles" or "stereotypes" also benefit?  Do you have any effective
strategies?  I have a good selection of readings (for example, Frye),
although I always welcome more suggestions, but I am particularly
interested in strategies of discussion, projects, etc for getting across
the concept of power--the issue that is most contentious because it
implies that men will have to give something up, as well as "gain"
something (in terms of a more just world, more humane relationships, etc).
ditto, all of this, by the way, with respect to discussing white
privilege with white students.
(anybody have particular success using McIntosh?)

thanks in advance,

Hi Kathy. I agree with you that this point is crucial and tricky to get
across. I've found it helpful in discussion to be very up front about the
ways in which elite white males and their (witting or unwitting)
representatives (including, alas, some women) exploit and exercise
power over other less powerful men (who are then often represented and
coded as less masculine, sub-human, or otherwise deviant from the proper
male norm). (An Asian-American student of mine just did a paper on the
"demasculinization" of Asian-American men in American films--it was
eye-opening for me.) The painful, ugly hierarchy among men--and women's
place in that hierarchy as scapegoats, workhorses, decorations,
trophies, doormats, etc.--can be vividly illustrated in many ways (films,
anecdotes).

When I begin a discussion by talking about the (global, economic and
sexual)  hierarchy among men, a woman of color in the class will
frequently respond by pointing out that even disempowered men can and do
oppress their female counterparts in the familiar ways (unpaid or
underpaid female labor, domestic violence, sexual oppression). At that
point, the vast  proportions of the tragedy begin to dawn on the students:
the oppressed oppress each other while the real power structure remains
unchallenged. Once the discussion gets to this point, the door is opened
to discussions of coalitions. I have found it difficult and uncomfortable
but rewarding and honest to take discussions to this point. It forces you
and the students to define your politics more clearly and I have found
that students appreciate this.

If you want (and it's not easy), you can also broach another tricky
question: why does the power structure go unchallenged, despite the fact
that it is a pyramid with a few people (mostly white males and their
favored subordinates, pawns and trophies) at the top and large numbers of
unpaid or low-paid workers at the bottom? What assumptions make this
pyramid seem normal and acceptable? What kinds or aspects of feminism
challenge those assumptions? I do think it's important to show that
privilege is systemic and not just an individual phenomenon.

Suzanne Pharr's essay, "Homophobia: A Weapon of Sexism," has a phrase
in it that my students frequently returned to. Who do gender roles
serve, she asks. "Men and the women who seek power from them." This
straightforward expression has the advantage of acknowleging that women
(like subordinate men in some ways) can and do have access to patriarchal
power and status if they seek that power by working with or pleasing the
(elite white) males at the top--serving those men's interests personally
and/or professionally. This opens the door to discussion of the
compromises and relative merits of "working within the system" vs.the
advantages of operating from the margins.  It can also open the door to
discussion of whether women would seek male approval so much if their
security did not depend on it and what women might do in various realms
of life if male approval were less of a priority. In other words, what
would happen (to men, to women, to the world) if more women were
in a position to exercise their own autonomous power rather than seek
power through the chain of command that leads up to the men at the top?

 Pharr's essay is great because it gives students "the big picture" by
connecting economic exploitation, physical violence and rigidly enforced
gender codes (homophobia and sex role stereotyping both) as things that
the existing power structure can use to sustain itself. Pharr emphasizes
that economic greed is not only one of the primary motivations for
subordinating and devaluing women; it's also one of the motivations for
racism. Some men benefit materially from the exploitation of women; others
would probably benefit more from teaming up with women to topple the
pyramid, but they are prevented from seeing that by sexism...

So, to sum up: I talk a lot about the hierarchy among men while trying at
the same time not to forget the reality of male privilege...I hope I
haven't wandered too far from your basic question....I'm curious to hear
how others approach these issues. Perhaps one project/assignment might be
to have students interview men of various ages and ask those men how aware
they are of male hierachy, what factors they think determine their place
in it, and where, in their opinion, women fit in.

Those of you interested in the discussion on student projects for
Introduction to Women's Studies may also be interested in the following
Call for Papers, which asks specifically for classroom applications (this
would include student projects).

                         CALL FOR PAPERS
               TEACHING INTRODUCTION TO WOMEN'S STUDIES:

    This collection will address the institutional context and social
issues in which teaching the women's studies introductory course is
embedded and, most importantly, provide readers with practical classroom
strategies to meet the challenges raised.  The collection will, therefore,
serve as a resource and preparatory text for all teachers of Intro.
including experienced teachers, less experienced teachers, new faculty,
and graduate student teaching assistants.  The collection will also be of
interest to educational scholars of feminist and progressive pedagogies
and innovative practices.  Submissions should be centered around one or
more of the following topic areas.

                           STUDENT EXPECTATIONS
--Student Expectations (ex: degree of student interest, resistance, and
motivation; gen. ed. students vs. WS majors; different student knowledge
bases, such as engineering or political science or women's studies;
diversity issues; perceptions of teaching legitimacy, who can or can't
teach what to whom)

--Debate and Discussion (ex: public culture/mass media presentations of
"women's topics"; student awareness/experience; classroom civility issues;
how to respectfully differ; how to listen to others)

--Authority in the Introduction to Women's Studies classroom (ex:
ideologies of education; student-centered classroom; differences in
resistance and conflict)

                       CLASSROOM STRATEGIES
--Teaching Specific Topics (ex: new ways to teach core concepts; new topic
development; teaching controversial issues)

--Conceiving the Course: Topic Organization (ex: issues given more
breadth; issues given more depth; social science vs humanities emphasis;
the order in which topics are introduced; specifics such as racism,
heterosexism, poverty, class, health, spirituality, images, language,
etc.)

--Syllabus Creation and Sample Syllabi (ex: sample syllabi with
explanatory discussion)

All authors should address the particular institutional context and social
issues in which their course is located.

Submit TWO complete copies: 1) a one-page detailed abstract of your
article which describes the topic and your approach, indicates a classroom
application, and demonstrates the clarity of both your thinking and
writing; 2) a two-page curriculum vitae, including pertinent paper and

Hi all,

Thought I would use this topic as an excuse to share my encouraging
experience with women's studies projects and to thank those of you who
made suggestions earlier this semester.

I did projects for the first time this semester, and the results amazed
me. I put them in groups of about five. The instructions were very broad.
I allowed them to do projects based on any one of the topics of the class
(sexuality; women's rights movements; beauty, health, and fitness;
reproduction/abortion; domestic and sexual violence; tv & movies; and
work), and I encouraged them to be creative.  I told them they would be
graded on how well they addressed the issues of gender and power; how much
credible and well researched information they were able to convey; their
organization; and their presentation.  The project was worth 25% of their
total grade, and I divided that up a bit based on suggestions of WMST-L
people.  I made 15% my grade for the group, 5% their self evaluation, and
5% their peers' evaluation.  Their self evals and peer evals were
terrific. I think perhaps I should have joined both the peer and self
evals, however, and made it 10%.

Anyway, the projects were terrific.  There was no overlap in terms of the
topics they chose (amazingly).  Some of the topics included gender and TV
commercials; the image of Black women in the media; gender and horror
films; sexual violence; domestic violence; and eating disorders.  They did
video interviews with students, conducted surveys, and did lots of
research.  They structured their presentations creatively, including a TV
news format; dramatic readings; audience participation; etc.  The projects
tended to be both analytical and also personal.  I am convinced that they
not only learned a great deal from their projects, they really felt like
they were participating in the process of education--and it became more
meaningful to them.

Thanks to the people who offered specific suggestions about how to do peer
and self evals.  Best,

In any of my women's Studies classes, we discuss what it means to "male bash."
I generally give the example, ""If I say that 1 in 4 women will be raped by a
man, is that male bashing?"  Almost universal nos.  "If I say all men are
rapists, is that male bashing?"  Almost universal yeses.  Then we talk about
patriarchy,and male privilege.  We also discuss how patriarchal culture is one
big "female Bash" but few people seem to be complaining about that.  And how
saying that women's studies classes are a bunch of "male bashing sessions" is a
way of dismissing women's  studies and stigmatizing it.  And trivializing it.
Instead of recognizing the rigorous academic work we do, we are reduced to
bitching about men and talking about our periods.
A big problem I run into is that students will often agree that women are
oppressed, but that men are oppressed too (because they are stigmatized if they
cry, for example).  I refer to Marilyn Frye's article "oppression" for
this one.
I do find hate women often become very angry at men and can make some really
negative comments about men.  I validate their anger, but  discuss hating
patriarchy versus hating men.  And I encourage them to channel that anger into
something proactive.

Hey, amy as well too my own horn too!:)
I taught Intro to Women's Studies last semester.  I had them do 2 projects, both

of which were very well received.  The first was a "3 generations" project.
they had to interview 3 women from 3 different generations (I defined that as at

least 10 years apart).  They formulated the questions based on class materials.

 They could pick a theme (such as body image) or ask a
variety of questions.  Students LOVED this.  Many (not all) interviewed family
members) and really learned alot.  Most went well over the number of suggested
pages (6-8).
The final project was to create a zine.  A zine is a do-it-yourself magazine.  I

brought in examples for those who didn't know.  The could work in pairs or
individually.  I encouraged creativity and variety.  Again, they could do one
topic or be more general (as long as it related to women).  I was VERY impressed

with the results.  One student used heres as a way of coming out, a returning
monm struggling with the job market did here's on women's work, a pair did a
womenderful one on women's spirituality,...
Aside from projects, I tried to encourage them to be active in the class.  We
had women's poetry day, and everyone brought in a poem or 2 written by a woman
(some brought in poems they wrote).
I talked about 3rd wave feminism and why college women were perceived as
apathetic.  Students started doing all sorts of proactive things after that
(some joined NOW, worked on getting lighting on campus, wrote letters to the
editor of the campus newspaper).
After showing "Not a Love Story," women were really shaken.  They decided to
vent their anger on a local store that sold porn.  I don't necessarily condone
what they did, but I was very pleased that they reacted actively.

A couple of months ago I placed an article that I had written about
ways in which three feminist filmmakers depict violence against women in
their films.  It's FILM ART001 on the WMST-L's FILM FILELIST.

I've just added a second article titled "Women in Hollywood Films of the '90s:
The Age of Comeuppance."  This piece was written for a trinational conference
on The North American Woman in the 1990s held in Mexico City in October, 1996.
There were other papers on women in film in the 1990s by Canadian and Mexican
authors.  In this piece I try to extend Molly Haskell's practice of character-
izing each decade, as she did in From Reverence to Rape.  Since that book
ends with the late 1980s, I look back over the reviews I've done for "Women
and Film" on "The Women's Show" since 1990 and try to do the same for this
decade.

You may get a copy of this article just the same way you get a film review:

the MSW program at IUPUI (Indiana University-Purdue University,
Indianapolis) is quite feminist friendly.  At least one of their
faculty (Marion Wagner) is a long-time feminist activist.
Every year the
NOW chapter in Indy has an intern  from that program.
