                     Second Call For Papers---COCOON'98

     Fourth Annual International Computing and Combinatorics Conference

                 August 12-14, 1997, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC

                  http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/cocoon98

                          In cooperation with
   Institute of Information Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan, ROC


This conference is intended to provide a forum for researchers in
theoretical computer science, combinatorics related to computing, and
experimental analysis of algorithms.  Typical, but not exclusive,
topics of interest include:

- algorithms and data structures
- complexity, automata, languages, logic, and computability
- computational algebra, biology, geometry, learning theory, and number theory
- cryptography, fault-tolerance, parallel and distributed computing
- combinatorics related to algorithms and complexity
- graph theory and switching networks
- experimental analysis of algorithms

Submissions to the conference this year will ONLY be conducted electronically.
Authors should  submit a standard PostScript file containing an extended
abstract either by an e-mail to cocoon98@iis.sinica.edu.tw or
through our web pages at http://www.iis.sinica.edu.tw/cocoon98.

Instructions are in our web pages and can also be obtained
by sending an e-mail to cocoon98@iis.sinica.edu.tw with the subject HELP.

Original research papers are solicited.  In addition to theoretical results,
we are particularly interested in submissions which report on experimental
and applied research of theoretical interest.  Special consideration will
be given to work that is motivated by real-world problems. Experimental
and applied papers are expected to show convincingly the usefulness and
efficiency of the algorithms discussed in a practical setting.

A PostScript file of submission must be received by February 10, 1998.
A submission should start with the title of the paper, author(s)' name,
affiliation and e-mail address, and a short summary of the main results of
the paper. This should be followed by a scholarly exposition of the ideas,
techniques, and a full description of the results achieved.  A clear
indication of the motivation and comparison with prior or related work
should be presented. The paper should not exceed 10 pages using 11 point
or larger font. Submissions that deviate significantly from these guidelines
and PostScript submissions that are unprintable or formatted for paper size
other than 8.5 x 11 inch paper risk rejection without consideration of
their merits.

Authors will be notified of acceptance or rejection by April 10, 1998.
A camera-ready copy of each accepted paper is required by May 20, 1998.
The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag
in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science series, and will be available
for distribution at the conference.

The Hao Wang Award  will be given for the second time to the paper judged
by the program committee to have the best scientific merit.
The program committee may decline to make the award, or may split it
among several papers.
