Charlie and Larry,
I just got this alert from netfusion.  I don't know if you have seen this or not, but I thought I would send you a copy.  There is a url that has additional information on this.  
It is: http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1997_4/subject.html#start

If you have already heard of this, please ignore my message.

Here is a cut and past of the web page.  I would give you the URL of the page I got this off of, but you need a userid and password to get it.

Hackers out for blood with new Land Attack

               By Ellen Messmer
               Network World, 12/1/97

               The Internet underworld last week unsheathed a new weapon capable of knocking out
               IP-based routers and servers, sending vendors scrambling to find ways to safeguard
               their gear.

               Land Attack, offically known as land.c program code, was posted on the 'Net by
               someone called ''Meltman'' and used last week in attacks on Cisco Systems, Inc.
               routers and Unix and Windows NT servers. Some of the targeted machines were
               slowed to a crawl while others had to be rebooted.

               Land Attack represents a new twist on the dreaded ''TCP SYN flooding''
               denial-of-service attack in which a hacker ties up a port on a network device or causes
               it to crash by flooding it with unwanted synchronization packets.

               The SYN packets are used to establish network connections in a three-way
               synchronize-acknowledge (SYN-ACK) handshake needed to set up a Web, telnet, File
               Transfer Protocol or SMTP session.

               But unlike TCP SYN flooding, Land Attack sends out just one sinister SYN packet in
               which the sending device's IP address has been swapped out for the IP address of the
               destination machine. When the destination machine tries to acknowledge receipt of the
               transmission, it ends up using its own address, meaning it is sending the message back
               to itself, resulting in a potentially fatal loopback condition.

               ''If someone could find a way to use this Land Attack program to spread this across the
               Internet, it could cause major service disruptions,'' pointed out Chris Klaus, chief
               technology officer at Internet Security Systems, Inc., whose software is aimed at
               detecting network-based intrusions and attacks.

               After some quick testing with Land Attack, vendors rapidly issued a long and
               unofficial list of network gear determined to be ''not vulnerable'' or vulnerable to
               anything ranging from 60-second slowdowns to total collapse.

               While Proteon, Inc. network gear and Hewlett-Packard Co. Unix machines appeared
               on the clean list, the news was not as good for Cisco routers, which form the heart of
               the Internet.

               Cisco, which got multiple reports that its routers were targeted, issued a general alert
               informing users that land.c can be used to launch denial-of-service attacks against
               Classic IOS software used on Cisco routers with product numbers greater than 1000. It
               also listed software on its CGS/MGS/AGS+ and the CS-500 gear as vulnerable.

               The company said the effect on the Cisco IOS/700 software used on Cisco 7xx routers
               ''is more devastating than the Classic IOS software.'' But it went on to say that most
               customers use firewalls to separate 7xx routers from the Internet, minimizing the threat.

               Cisco said the Cisco Catalyst 5000 LAN switches also are vulnerable, but they can be
               safeguarded by removing their IP address. This, however, has the effect of disabling
               remote management, Cisco noted. The company added that the Cisco PIX firewall
               ''appears not to be affected.''

               As of deadline, Cisco had issued patches for some of its gear, but not all. It advised users to stay tuned to
               www.cisco.com to get field alerts on the TCP loopback attack.

               Microsoft Corp., whose Windows 95 and NT machines were on the ''vulnerable'' list, downplayed the
               extent of the damage caused by Land Attack.

               ''We tested NT 4.0 with our Service pack 3 and Land Attack just slows it down for 60 seconds and then
               resumes normal operations,'' said Karan Khanna, Microsoft product manager for NT. Microsoft planned to
               issue a patch by today.

               Sun Microsystems, Inc., whose Solaris boxes generally were listed as not vulnerable, did get an
               vulnerable rating for SunOS 1.4 and SunOs 1.4. A Sun spokesman said the company was not aware of the
               security uproar around Land Attack.
