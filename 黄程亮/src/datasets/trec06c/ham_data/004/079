ANNOUNCEMENT and CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


                        European Educational Forum

                School on COMPUTATIONAL and SYNTACTIC METHODS

                Mierlo, The Netherlands, August 11 -- 22, 1997


http://www.win.tue.nl/cs/ipa/activities/school.on.compsynmeth.0897.html



GENERAL INFORMATION

The School on Computational and Syntactic Methods is the second event
organised by the European Educational Forum (EEF), a joint initiative of
the three interuniversitary research schools BRICS (Basic Research In
Computer Science) from Denmark, IPA (Institute for Programming research
and Algorithmics) from the Netherlands, TUCS (TUrku centre for Computer
Science) from Finland. The first EEF-event was the School on Embedded
Systems, in November 1996; the third EEF-event will be the School on
Natural Computing to be held in Turku, Finland, August 25 --29, 1997.

The EEF organises a series of four `Summer Schools on Foundations of
Computing Science', each covering specific parts of the Handbook of
Logic in Computer Science (Eds. Abramsky, Gabbay and Maibaum, Oxford
University Press). The relevant Handbook chapters are part of the course
material. The first school in this series of four is this School on
Computational and Syntactic Methods, to be held in Mierlo, close to
Eindhoven in the south of the Netherlands. The school is sponsored by
the EC via the TMR network ``Synergos'', so young researchers (up to 35
years of age) from the EC can apply for a grant, covering for part of
the costs for travel and subsistance.

PROGRAM FOR THE SCHOOL

The program of the school consists of five courses. Each of the courses
consists of lectures and exercise hours.
Details of the precise schedule of the courses will be provided later.
The courses to be given are:

     Term Rewriting - Klop (Amsterdam NL), Zantema (Utrecht NL)
     Type Systems - Barendregt (Nijmegen NL), Geuvers (Eindhoven NL)
     Models of Concurrency - Winskel, Nielsen (Aarhus DK)
     Effective Algebras - Tucker (Swansea UK), Stoltenberg-Hansen
                                                (Uppsala SE)
     Process Algebra - Baeten (Eindhoven NL), Verhoef (Amsterdam NL)

COURSE MATERIAL
The material will be handed out at the beginning of the course. It
includes Volumes 2 and 4 of the Handbook of Logic in Computer Science
(Eds. Abramsky, Gabbay and Maibaum, Oxford University Press)and
furthermore some additional course notes and exercises.

LOCATION AND ACCOMODATION
Mierlo is a small city close to the city of Eindhoven, in the south of
the Netherlands. Eindhoven is 1 hour and 50 minutes by train from
Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Eindhoven has its own small airport and good
train connections with the rest of the Netherlands.
The event takes place in the Conference Centre `de Brug' in Mierlo. Here
you will find all facilities under one roof: hotel-rooms, restaurants,
bars and a wide range of sports- and recreation facilities (such as
bowling, squash and tennis courts, a swimming pool, sauna, fitnessroom,
etc.). De Brug also provides a nice environment for cycling
and hiking.
The prices are: Dfl 1669,- per person, from August 11 till August 22 on
a two-person bedroom. (Includes all meals and tea and coffee during the
breaks.) An extra night before or after the meeting costs Dfl 83,-. For

respectively. Only a limited number of one-person bedrooms is available.
The costs of your stay are to be paid to the Conferece Centre De Brug.
