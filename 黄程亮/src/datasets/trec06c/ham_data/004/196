                     First International Conference
                                 on


                         Tools and Algorithms

             for the Construction and Analysis of Systems


                       March 31 - April 2, 1998

                          Lisbon (Portugal)


SCOPE:
~~~~~


Many similar tools and algorithms have been independently developed
in various areas of computer science like automata and language theory,
verification and synthesis of hardware and software systems, construction
and analysis of real time systems, software engineering, type and proof
theory, logic and algebra.

TACAS is a 'community-independent' forum for discussion between the
researchers and developers interested in tools. In the focus are basic principles and application-independent features of algorithms and their implementation, with the aim to increase the reliability, flexibility and efficiency of current tools by highlighting common problems, heuristics, data structures, and solutions. In particular, theoretical papers with a clear link to tool construction and tool descriptions and applications with conceptual message are encouraged.

As TACAS addresses quite a heterogeneous audience, one of the major selection criteria for papers and tool demonstrations is a widely accessible presentation on a conceptual rather than technical level. This requires authors to think about their techniques in a wider context, which we believe is the key to a wider dissemination of more and more professional tools. Moreover it establishes a significant difference between TACAS contributions and typical publications in the various specialized communities, where a large common basis can be assumed.

REGULAR PAPERS AND REFEREED TOOL PRESENTATIONS ARE EQUALLY TREATED:

accepted contributions will receive the same space in the conference schedule and in the proceedings. In addition, there will be informal tool demonstrations during the breaks.

The topics of the workshop include:

- compositional verification and construction techniques;
- refinement-based methodologies;
- heterogeneous analysis;
- theorem-proving and model checking;
- analytical techniques for real-time, hybrid, probabilistic, and
  safety-critical systems;
- tool environments and tool architectures;
- applications and case studies

                      International  Workshop  on


                 Visualization Issues for Formal Methods


                            March 30, 1998
                          Lisbon  (Portugal)




Formal Methods are increasingly needed in  industrial practice. The great
challenge for the future is to fully integrate the  use of formal methods
into the development process. Development engineers are unlikely to adopt
the mathematical notations underlying formal methods; accordingly, formal methods  must be  presented and  encapsulated in an  application-oriented
fashion inorder to be easily understood and applied by their users.

Visualization and  user-friendly interfaces are key issues for this. This
one-day  workshop  intends to  bring   together people from  industry and
academia to discuss  ongoing work  in the field with  particular focus on
the transfer of research results into practical solutions.
Conversely, needs  arising  in  concrete  application  contexts  shall be
presented to provide feedback to the research arena. The workshop intends
to provide a forum for critical discussion for people who are  interested
in the various technical aspects of formal methods and visualization.

Topics:
~~~~~~

Original contributions are invited from both academia and industry on the following  (non-exclusive) list of topics.  All contributions should take
into account the integration of formal methods and visualization concepts.

   - Application of visualization and  representation concepts to support
     domain-specific instantiations of formal methods

   - System architectures for enhanced graphical support

   - Graphical or visual methods and tools supporting automatic analysis,
     synthesis and verification methods

   - Effects  of  visual information on  productivity and performance in
     formal methods

   - Case studies based on visually-oriented tools, or comparison studies
     between  visually  and  sententially  oriented  tools  and  their
     applications.

The contributors should keep in mind that the goals of the  workshop will
be best fulfilled if a lively and fruitful communication between research
and industry can be initiated.

Workshop Organization:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The workshop will be associated with  TACAS'98, the Intern. Conference on
Tools and Algorithms for the  Construction and Analysis of Systems, which
is part of ETAPS'98.  Its working language is English.
Besides technical talks of roughly 30 minutes each, including discussion,
also  invited talks by distinguished speakers and tool demonstrations are
planned.
