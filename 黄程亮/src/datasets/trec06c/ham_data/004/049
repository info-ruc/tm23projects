I have a plan9 system and a unix system connected by an ethernet.
I can telnet from the p9 to the unix (IRIX), but I can' telnet from
the unix to the p9., or from p9 to itself. In both cases that fail
I get "Connection Refused". I suppose this means the hardware is functional
but there is a permission of some kind missing in the p9 system.

I have tried quite a few  combinations of arguments with aux/listen;
it returns "giving up on ..".

Will some one please straighten me out?

tnx
