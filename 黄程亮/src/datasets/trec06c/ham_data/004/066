Russ Cox made it easier to add new keyboard sequences to
plan 9.  The pertinent files are:

ftp://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/update/cmd/aux/mklatinkbd.c
frp://plan9.bell-labs.com/plan9/update/9/port/858968110.rc

Here's his mail explaining it:

  Subject: /lib/keyboard and latin1.c

  A while ago, Rob and I exchanged the attached email.
  It's a shame that editing /lib/keyboard doesn't work, so
  I fixed that.  Take a look at ls /usr/rsc/kbd/mklatinkbd.c.
  The way I've installed it at home is to change latin1.c to read

	struct cvlist
	{
		char	*ld;		/* must be seen before using this conversion */
		char	*si;		/* options for last input characters */
		Rune	*so;		/* the corresponding Rune for each si entry */
	} latintab[] = {
	#include "latin1.h"
		0,	0,		0
	};

  and then have mkfile generate latin1.h with 
	aux/mklatinkbd /lib/keyboard >latin1.h

  As an aside, I found two ``bugs'' in the keyboard file
  as shipped on the CD.  The sequences <= and => are used
  for both ≤, ≥ and ⇐,⇒, according to /lib/keyboard.
  It looks like they've been fixed, at least on emelie
  (haven't checked elsewhere).  The program will catch
  duplicate sequences.

    how does one add more compose sequences
    in plan 9?  i tried editing /lib/keyboard
    and rebooting, but that did not work.

      unfortunately, it's not nearly that easy.  you need to edit
      /n/bootes/sys/src/9/port/latin1.c.  you just edited the
      documentation, a rarely successful method of change.
