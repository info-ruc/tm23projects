The url for some html file in the folder I created for you would be

http://rsvp.rpi.edu/iai/some_file.html

About the quizzes; sure, I can do that.  We can keep it simple for now, but
it the future I can automate the quizzes.  Instead of creating an html
document for each quiz, you can give me a specially formatted text file,
and my web server will generate the html page automatically.  I can also
have the quiz cgi script log student answers, so you can look at the
results too.
