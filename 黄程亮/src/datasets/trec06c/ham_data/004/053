Folks,
All ACIS-2C phase 2/F eventlists and related data are
on disk now. The disk is here at MIT on space.mit.edu

The data are in '/starburst/d2/aqlc1'  
for days 970218 to 970303
 
and  '/starburst/d2/aqlc2' 
for days 970304 to 970311

Since I did the backup on /bulk/aqlc on mashine AQLC2
on XRCF 2nd floor I also copied a lot of low byte trash
with it. I cleaned some, but not all of it. 
 
The data*.fits files in /starburst/d2/aqlc1 are 
example bias.files for all ccds and window modes.
File data_F-I2C-RC-72.002s5.0104.fits is something  
for everybody to take home and frame.
 
File fam_positions.dat in /starburst/d2/aqlc2 are 
the actual FAM positions during the sub-pixel tests. 

How to find data:
EXAMPLE:
'ls /starburst/d2/aqlc1/970221' lists 
"FOO             FOOBAR          R-I2C-PI-9.006  R-I2C-PI-9.006A catalog.gz      ftp.txt.gz"
Forget about everything that doesn't look like a TRW-ID, which leaves two directories,
" R-I2C-PI-9.006  R-I2C-PI-9.006A"
The one with an "A" is usually a repeat at a later time with different input parameters
'ls /starburst/d2/aqlc1/970221/R-I2C-PI-9.006' lists
an index_file, which cats all the event list names (used by the PSU quicklook)
the avarage bias file (R-I2C-PI-9.006s1_bias_avg.fits.gz),
and a data directories named after all the used sequence numbers, which in this
case are s1 and s2 and s101, *.1 to *.6 belong to a single run but were hacked during
processing. s2 and s101 are new data aquisitions after either aborting or extending s1
'ls /starburst/d2/aqlc1/970221/R-I2C-PI-9.006/s1.1' finally lists
"R-I2C-PI-9.006s1.1_evts.fits.gz         R-I2C-PI-9.006s1.1_hk.fits.gz           R-I2C-PI-9.006s1.1_oc_stat.dat.gz"
the actual data. The scientific data are in R-I2C-PI-9.006s1.1_evts.fits.

PLEASE:
If you don't use the PSU quicklook  software, copy the eventlists onto a disk
of your choice, it better not be one of mine, and THEN mess around as you wish, ok!

Have fun, Norbert
