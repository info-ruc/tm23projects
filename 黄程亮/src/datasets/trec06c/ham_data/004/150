General Information
-------------------

The 4th Colloquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity=
 will =

focus on the relationship between computing and communication, i.e., the =
study =

of those factors which are significant for the computability and the =

communication complexity of problems, and on the interplay between struct=
ure, =

knowledge and complexity in systems of communicating agents. The Colloqui=
um is =

designed to bring together researchers interested in the fundamental =

principles underlying all computing through communication. =


The colloquium will take place at the Centro Stefano Franscini on the Mon=
te =

Verita above Ascona, in the Italian speaking part of Switzerland. On the =

shores of Lake Maggiore, Ascona (Canton Ticino) enjoys a Mediterranean cl=
imate =

in an alpine setting. With over 2,300 hours of sunshine per year, Ascona =
is =

Switzerland's sunniest place; the average July temperature varies between=
 20=B0C =

and 30=B0C during the day. The average water temperature in July of Lake =

Maggiore is 23=B0C. =


Excellent train connections exist from Milano or Zurich to the area of th=
e =

meeting. It takes less than 2 hours (3 hours) to travel from Milano (from=
 =

Zurich) to Ascona/Locarno by train. We will provide a bus-service from th=
e =

station to the Centro Stefano Franscini. The Canton Ticino has a tiny air=
port =

of its own: Lugano-Agno. From Lugano-Agno Crossair (the Swiss regional ai=
rline) =

flights link business people to some European cities.
