Hi Everyone,

I would like to hold a meeting on Monday to meet with all people interested in
helping out with the Summer camp. As far as Yoga goes, we should not need
any preparations before the event. During the event we would need volunteers.
But Mrs. Yash Garg would be providing them. So if anything we would need one
extra person there from Asha. For the other two events, we would need to
work on the ideas and come up with interesting programs. We would certainly
need help there. So anyway we will talk about all this during our Monday
meeting.

All people who would be helping out with this event must attend this
meeting. And please everyone, we need all the help we can get. Particularly
students, because the events will be during the day on Weekdays.

Let me know if this time is not convenient. Today evening I will send a mail
confirming the time and give directions to my place.

For those who do not remember my last mail, we have decided to have the
following events.

1. Yoga -- Two one hour sessions of Yoga (actual Yoga class would be for
40 mins) from 9:00 to 10:00 on two days. Gurvinder would conduct this.

2. Message of Hope -- In order to spread the message of Asha, we will tell
the Summer camp children about Asha, about under-priviledged children in
India, about how Asha helps them etc. We will pick a school in India that
we are sponsoring that has about 40 kids. and then ask each one of the summer
camp children to write letters to one kid in that list. We will also ask them
to bring some small gift for the child in India. We havent decided who will
organise it. This will occupy another one hour session.

3. Potpourri -- Divide the children into teams. Alternately each team will
have to pick a task from a basket. These may be things like "sing an Indian
song", or "bray like a donkey" or "talk for a minute about what things you
find common between India and US" ... It may also be GK questions about India.

Rajaram
