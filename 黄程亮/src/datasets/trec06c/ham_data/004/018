Third and final attempt to get an answer. I have been informed that the
news-to-list gateway does not seem to work. Therefore I email directly
to the list. I'm not on the list myself, so please post news or email
me directly.


My plan to get Plan9 up and running was built upon the idea that I
could use a borrowed PC to construct a system disk (SCSI) and then use
that disk on my Sparc.
Is that possible?

I know Plan9 will handle endianess under normal circomstances (9P). But
how does the kfs server write to its local SCSI disks? Perhaps the disk
is written using local endianess (PC little-endian, Sparc big-endian).
Is there somebody that knows?
