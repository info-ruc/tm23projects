                              CALL FOR PAPERS

            Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures (WADS'97)

               August 6-8, 1997 Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada

The Workshop, which alternates with the Scandinavian Workshop on Algorithm
Theory, is intended as a forum for researchers in the area of design and
analysis of algorithms and data structures. We invite submissions of papers
presenting original research on algorithms and data structures in all areas,
including combinatorics, computational geometry, databases, graphics,
parallel and distributed computing.

For detailed conference information, please consult http://www.tuns.ca/~wads.

Contributors are invited to submit a full paper (not exceeding 12 pages) to

                 Workshop on Algorithms and Data Structures
                         School of Computer Science
                        Carleton University Ottawa,
                               Canada K1S 5B6
                           tel.: (613) 520-4333,
                            fax:(613) 520-4334,
                        e-mail: wads@scs.carleton.ca

Submissions must arrive before March 3, 1997 and can be in one of the
following two formats:

   * Electronic submission: A Postscript file sent by e-mail to
     wads@scs.carleton.ca. Details on the file format are given at the end
     of this call for papers.
OR
   * Hardcopy submission:Two paper copies AND a Postscript file on diskette
     (standard UNIX, PC, or MAC diskette; use the same file format as for
     electronic submissions). In case it is necessary to compress the file
     to fit it on a diskette, use only gzip or UNIX compress. Label the
     diskette with your name, the disk format used and, if necessary,
     instructions on how to uncompress.

It is the responsibility of the authors to ensure that the Postscript file
submitted is complete (containing all figures etc.) and that is prints under
UNIX on a standard laser-printer. The paper's front page should indicate the
contact author with e-mail, postal address and phone/fax numbers. Authors
will be notified of acceptance or rejection by April 30, 1997. Proceedings
will be published in the Springer Verlag series Lecture Notes in Computer
Science. The final versions of accepted papers must arrive in camera-ready
form before May 23, 1997 to ensure the availability of the proceedings at
the conference.
