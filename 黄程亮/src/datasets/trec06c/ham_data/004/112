We will have a meeting at my place on Sunday at 10:30 am. If people want to
make this a mini-potluck meeting, let me know. Otherwise it will be a 
non-potluck meeting.

We need the following things for the Potpourri.

1. Macaroni -- I will buy this.

2. A reasonably think string. Does anyone have the twine kind of string at
home? This is to string the Macaronis. Ordinary cloth thread is too flimsy.
If you have some thicker string let me know and bring it over to the meeting.
Otherwise if you have any idea where I can get such a string let me know.

3. Coins of all denominations -- Bring as many as you can to the meeting.

4. If anyone has 6-8 identical small boxes or small bags bring it over. This is
for the putting the coins in before giving to the teams.

5. Various things for the memory challenge puzzle. Ravi will you bring this
directly to the Hindu Samaj on Monday? Also let us know if you want us to
bring some stuff. We should try to have 50 or 75 different things.


The directions to my place are as follows:

Take the outer-beltline (I-440 with increasing exit numbers). Take exit 10 to
Old Wake forest road.

On the exit all the 3 lanes will turn left.  You also turn left and you will
be on Old Wake forest road.

Go past 3 or 4 traffic lights, keep to the left lane. You will come to a
traffic light for Hardimont road (On the left it is Hardimont road and
on the right it is New Hope Church Road). At that light, on the left you
will also see a Wendy's and a Crown Gas station.

Take a left on Hardimont road and then an immediate right on to Bland road.

On Bland road you will see Tree top apartments to your left. That is where
I live but dont enter from Bland road. Steinbeck Dr. will come on your left.
Turn left.

The first four left turns will lead into the apt complex. The second one
will have signs for the information center. Take the third one. You will
see signs for building 1316. In building 1316 my apartment (Apt F) is on
the first floor.  Note that there are two entrances to this building. You
will have to take the second one.

Once again my phone number is 878-3781.
