I find this a troubling question.  What do you mean by ethnic?  Marriage
between Irish and Italians?

Sharon:

Ada Maria Isasi-Diaz has a great article called "Toward an Understanding of
Feminismo Hispano in the USA" -- I found this in an anthology called
*Women's Consciousness, Women's Conscience," ed. Barbara Hilkert Andolsen,
et al.  Minneapolis: Winston Press, 1985.

She talks about what it means to be feminist and Hispanic in the USA, in
what I think is an accessible and theoretically useful way.  She pays
attention to problematic issues in relating to the broader Hispanic
community and to white feminists, and tasks everyone with contributing to
the fight for social justice.

Aside from the larger implications of this (and I have to wonder where,
say, we junior faculty members fit into such a paradigm), what then does
one recommend that the original post-er do now?

Faced (for whatever combination of controllable and uncontrollable reasons)
with a sizable group of students in her class who might justly complain
that her original syllabus leaves them out, but not yet an expert in the
literature/experiences that might best demonstrate or elucidate their
concerns, she'd like to take action.

So what do we recommend?

She should just teach what she already knows, and thus leave the students
once again unrepresented and convinced that "feminism doesn't want/see us"?
At least one reply has nixed that idea, and I agree.

She should admit ignorance and rely on the students to speak from their own
knowledge?  Replies that note the length of time it takes to realize one's
own complex oppression, that remind us that minority students shouldn't
have to be the ones who are always teaching the rest of us, and that
suggest that not all students are ready to translate experience into
concepts without guidance, move us away from this response, and I agree
there, too.

She should admit ignorance, noting that there *is* information out there if
the students are interested in going to find it, but that she's not going
to teach about it?  See above.

This is not about what she should *have* done (spend 6 years studying the
perspectives and lives of Chicana feminists? 10 years? hindsight is
easy...), but about what she can and should do *now*. I am interested in
replies, since my own classes not infrequently present me with such
pedagogical emergencies.  (I'd like to be prepared for everything, but
haven't managed it yet....)

I'm in full agreement with the well-stated arguments explaining why
studying other cultures is a complex, long-term project, and one likely to
yield an imperfect view to the outsider.  I guess I'm still a believer in
"Gotta Start Somewhere" (both personally and, as Jack Meacham pointed out,
systemically), at least for teachers of integrity, care, and caution.

The issue of "ethnicity" has already been problematized extensively in the
class and students have discussed the consequences of labeling certain
groups "ethnic" and other groups "races." In our class, ethnicity is used to
refer to people who identify with a specific group based on langauge,
culture, religon, custom, place of origin, etc.    The class, because we are
in Los Angeles, contains many students who are immigrants or children of
immigrants.  Some of the students expressed their parents' desire that they
marry a person of the same ethnic background.  I think part of the "answer"
to the question would be exactly the point you seem to be trying to make -
on what groups are statistics about "intermarriage" collected?

Subject:      Chicana feminism

This is a sticky one...

I think we are discussing several different issues.

I agree with most of the posters.  I agree with Daphne that throwing in
a book on the recommendation of an e-mail post is not necessarily the
best way to proceed BUT the women's studies list is not just any
e-mail list. One of the things I have come to depend upon in the
six or seven years that I have been on it is that the thoughtfulness
and erudition of most of the people who respond to questions such as these
give us a special edge.

It is difficult to acquire expertise in an area of study that is completely
unfamiliar. However, Chicana studies is still in its infancy.  There
are few books available that would stand up to the rigors of professional
criticism.  I realize people will be infuriated by my saying this, but I
have a fairly good acquaintance with the work in the field, and a lot of it
is wonderful but not yet scholarly. Much of it is impressionistic, touchy-
feely, and poetic, but undisciplined in the way that I would want. I think
that part of the reason for this is that there are so FEW Latinas who have the
academic credentials to do this work, and we are so burdened with teaching,
serving on every committee that they can get us on (it reminds me of scenes
from the Old Testament Book of Ezechiel), that we are not producing the
theoretical and scholarly books in the critical mass necessary to make an
impact.

In fact, the best book, in my opinion for understanding the Chicano
experience is George Sanchez' _Becoming a Mexican American_. I simply haven't
seen ANYTHING by a woman approaching the depth and breadth of this book.

As for the students knowing more than the teacher, well, I would take issue
with that idea as well. Students come in with raw experience that, unless
they are particularly acute and insightful, they may not have the words to
express. The books like Anzaldua's _Borderlands_ or _Haciendo Caras_
connect solidly with them because her books mirror their experiences. An
insightful teacher, even one who is not of the same ethnic/racial origins,
may also have expertise that will facilitate that connection. In a way,
it is like a therapist: She may not have direct experience with incest
or substance abuse but she may still be an excellent counselor because
of her training and empathy.

When I was a grad student teaching at UCLA, I had many students who were
from Guatemala.  Having come in prepubescence to Los Angeles, they had
certain memories of living in Guatemala, and more often than not, had been
inculcated with the apolitical views of their parents. They believed that
only people who looked for trouble got hurt in Guatemala; they did not believe
that there was censorship of the press there.  They didn't believe the horror
stories in the LA Times saying that it was just American propaganda.
Having lived in Guatemala as a child, albeit forty years ago, and being brought
up by a mother who argued exactly the same way as these young people's
parents, BUT also having read the reports not only in the press but in the
reports from Amnesty International and other human rights organizations,
I had a different and, I think, more valid point of view than they did
from their protected backgrounds.

I remember being in a markletplace one day, with my grandmother, when
we heard loud pops and the sound of horses.  She grabbed me and pulled me into
a store where we lay, face down in sawdust while there was much commotion
outside, screaming, lots of (what I realized later) was gunfire.  We went
out the back door, and I never saw what had happened.  Moreover, we never
spoke of it. Years later, when I asked my grandmother, she replied mildly
that she didn't remember anything like that, that I must have dreamed it.
My mother gave me the same reply.  I can feel the sawdust in my nostrils
to this day but I can get no one to confirm that it happened.  So when
these young people, whose experience was much more recent than mine,
tried to argue that the stories about the violence in Guatemala was
just U.S. propaganda, I could point to the Human Rights reports. The
sawdust didn't give me that authority.

These are very difficult issues.  I hope we can exercise patience with
each other as we hash them out.

Rosie

MEMBERS OF THE LIST

I'm here once again to ask for your help. My small liberal arts,
historically Baptist college, is on the verge of having a Women's
Studies minor.  I am chairing the task force that has brought that
effort about.  The proposal will go to the curriculum committee this
week and to the faculty in early spring.  Several voices have sprung
forth with last minute resistance, couching it in terms of the title,
Women's Studies.  they say that this title is too exclusive and
leaves our male students out.  We have taken care int he proposal to
make it clear that male students are not only welcomed but encouraged
to take these classes.  Our detractors suggest the title, Gender
Studies instead.  Most of us argue that Gender Studies is a different
area of study altogether, with a major focus on gay, lesbian, and
bi-sexual theory.  Our faculty doesn't have the expertise to offer
such classes, and I'm not at all certain that this college would be
ready for that.  Have any of you experience this reaction? And doyou
have any advice.  thanks.

    This issue has come up several times before on WMST-L.  Two of the
ensuing discussions have been made into files you can write for.  Send the
following two-line message to LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU:

        GET WOMEN_VS GENDER
        GET WOMEN_VS GENDER2

        Please note the underscore between WOMEN and VS, and please note
that that's a V in VS (as in victory), not a U.  If you want to see what
other files are available, add a third line that says INDEX WMST-L (just
those two words).

        Finally, please remember to send your message to LISTSERV, **not**
to WMST-L!

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

It might be useful at this point in our discussion to revisit Sharon
Snow's initial request regarding Chicana feminism.

First, she asked for an article, not a book (as many or most respondents
are claiming or assuming). Does this make a difference?

Second, she clearly stated that she is teaching an Intro to WS course.
This may involve lecturing to a large class.  Does this make a difference?
Do any of us teaching Intro to WS courses expect to be experts in every
area (cultural or disciplinary) to which we "introduce" our students?

Finally, she explained that she was planning a class session on
"feminist theory" (which doesn't necessarily comprise a major component of
every intro class).  Why assume (as a number of us seem to have done) that
material by and about Chicanas won't be included in other parts of the
course?

Let's remember, too, that many of those teaching introductory-level
courses are graduate students without the privilege of decades-long
careers and the luxury of teaching only (or perhaps ever!) in their fields
of specialty.  Does this make a difference?

Please, can we listen to each other a little more closely???

Just my two bits,

Sheila

Subject:      "Sass"

A faculty member asked for some help finding  information on
a movement among African-American women writers that he says is called
"sass".  I've looked so far at a variety of journal indexes including
the MLA, Humanities Index, Contemporary Womens Issues, as well as more
general ones, and have not found anything that fits his description.
Any knowledge, ideas, suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Betty, at LSU, after much debate, we decided to call ourselves "Women's

both Women's Studies and Gender Studies.  Good luck!

ACtually, you know what I would like to see, is to move
the discussion to the other end of the spectrum. I don't think
there's much else to be said about what the original
poster can do (there's been suggestions of articles, books,
ways to teach,  how to include the material, etc). seems
enough.

but I'd be interested to know what other people have done to
expand their boundaries of teaching "feminism."  One thing
I noticed is that no one mentioned two or more people
teaching a class for example. I think perhaps some
people may have some very interesting ideas to share.
I'd be specially interested in experiences where
teachers tried to change the structure of the class,
learning dynamics, that does not follow this ( IMO horrendously)
hierarchical rigid Western academic structure.

Rosa,
    What you say in terms of Chicana Studies in your posting hurts me
deeply because it reminds me of the many times that we, Latinas or
Chicanas have been treated as if our politics, our understanding of the
world was "uncivilized", "childish", "undeveloped". I may agree with you
that there are not enough Latina Proffessors, accademic or researchers
with the "appropriate" credentials to teach or writte on this issue in
terms estipulated by "accademic" texts. However, I would argue that has
more to do with the system than with our politics.
   I would like to say that although it is true that many younger people
may assimilate the messages pass on by their parents in regards to the
politics of Latin America, there are many more Latinas who are a lot more
clearer of their politcs because they were and are active and
revolutionaries in
their homelands. I do not want to forget that the struggle at a grassroot
level in many countries in Latin America has been carried on by women who
although may not posses the "accademic credentials", know a great deal
more than I would ever know here. I proudly count my mother among them.
Feminism, or women studies may not be in many Latina women's vocabulary, it
also true that many of our  testimonies speak more of experiences than
theories, but that does not mean that we are more "touchy feeling", or
infantile as you suggest. I believe all aspects are important and
necessary, the experiential learning and the thgeoretical learning. All
of those need to be included in the classroon.
   In terms of concrete ideas for the original posting, I believe there
are at least some Chicana professor, or accdemics who could contribute to
and understanding of Chicana issue and who may be available to attend a
shor lecture on the issue. A teacher needs to be able to recognize her
shortfalls and use the ressources available to her in the community.
Isn't that appropriate and sensitive teaching?

I am looking for research about the hypothesis that
a diverse workforce (academic, business or government)
yields increased productivity, lower turn-over, increased
creativity, etc.

In working with faculty to employ teaching methods in
introductory science/math/engineering courses which empower
all students to create knowledge, I am continually asked about
the long-term effectiveness of diversifying the workplace.

If you respond to me directly, I will compile the responses
and share them with the entire list.

    Although Ruth and I agree about many things, I don't see her concern about
adding a reading to a syllabus the way she does.
    Ruth, you seem to assume as Daphne does that the teachers will use the
reading as "the right" representation of Chicana women/feminists. Why not
assume instead that the teacher 1) has knowledge about Chicanas/os but
doesn't know of a reading appropriate for a intro WS course, which she
requested; 2) will use the reading to raise critical questions about the
contents; 3)understands that many representations of a group totalize that
group and knows to look for that and alert students to it if it's in a
text; 4)knows about authors' point of view and teaches students to look for
that; 5)will read as many of the books recommended on wmst as she can
(perhaps too quickly, given the short time mentioned) before she puts in on
the syllabus; and 6)will prepare reasonably well before that reading comes
up in the class.
    I also don't think you should assume, as you seem to, that the teacher is
"engulfed" in US perspectives - what is that, anyway? there are diverse
perspectives in the US - and needs an antidote in a student/s in class.
And, while I agree that a teacher should expect to be an informant with
ample background in a class and be respectful of authors, I also think that
she should be respectful of students as knowers and style discussions of
readings to invite their questions, additions, corrections, etc. The
teacher in question (I don't recall her name.) indicated that she has good
reason to expect Mexican Americans in her class. Does that put the burden
them to educate everyone else there about Mexican Americans? Not
necessarily at all.
    Suppose there are no Mexican Americans in the class? Shouldn't they be in
the course, as part of the students' reality? Recall the old saw that
students today didn't live 100 years ago but we try to help them 'get into
the period' and consider how it effects them. I believe, in fact, that it's
a mistake to confine a course in the US to consideration of people in the
US apart the reality of their relationship to people in other countries.
It's not possible to teach everything in one course but samplers from
post-colonized and continuing-to-be-colonized territories could give
students in the US a better understanding of how they are situated and how
they look from abroad. I'm expecting/hoping that the course wouldn't simply
be taking students on a cultural safari but would be working toward a
perspective on contexts.
    On student input. My experience with WS classes, undergrad and grad, made
up of students with a variety of backgrounds and mixtures of them (race,
ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, age, etc), has been that exchanges
of questions and comments informed everyone, raised sights about diversity
of experience, fired imaginations about how to read and inspired at least
some students to move on to learn more about a topic.

I am sorry that you are hurt by my words. I did not intend to hurt
anyone, but only to explain how I see the current development of this field.

I did not use, nor did I intend any of those characterizations.  To me,
there are various levels of knowledge and understanding. In the beginning,
there is the raw experience that is found in the direct recounting of
those who have experienced it. Then come the forms of telling that are more
sophisticated than the witness account.  Poetry, which speaks directly
to the heart; cuentos, and prose: each of which is  trying to make sense
the experience. Then comes the self-conscious development of theory: Looking
at the experience of others, and at the way others have theorized their lives.
Looking to see what makes us alike, and what is utterly unique to us.

If you look at the development of women's studies, there are notable
gaps in the seminal works. Germaine Greer's books, Susan Brownmiller on
rape, Betty Friedan's _Feminine Mystique_ reflect a certain stage of
development in the discipline. While they still have a certain historical
value, we have moved beyond that stage both in the movement, and in
women's studies programs. We are no longer simply discovering our
oppression.  To me, many of the books that are widely read in Chicana
studies are discovering our oppression. They are important for that
reason, but George Sanchez's book takes the study of Chicanos to the next
theoretical level.

And I would argue that it has more to do with the disparate development
of the various Chicano and Latino communities in America.  In Los Angeles,
where I lived for many years, there were Latina professionals whose families
had lived there for  generations and who were very well-off. There were also
new Mexican, Guatemalan and Salvadoran immigrants who worked in the sweat
shops and spoke no English.  Many of those Chicanas did not identify with
the new immigrants and had more in common with the Cuban emigre professionals
in Miami.

I don't know how you quantify  "more."  For one thing, the involvement
in revolutionary movements may have more to do with class than anything else.

and then a revolutionary.  The same was not true of the 18 and 19 year-old
Guatemalan women who sat in my classroom at UCLA.  Brought to the US by
parents who were well-off, they had been protected from the terrible
knowledge of the reality of life in Guatemala.   I taught the children
of diplomats, and in one instance, the son of the Consul General of Mexico.
Hardly a revolutionary bunch.

Revolution is one thing; academic learning is another. No one is suggesting

different kinds of knowledge.

Yes, but they teach different things and cannot be thrown together
as if they were all the same.

I strongly believe that CHICANA or LATINA studies, as a discipline, is
still in its infancy. Women's studies programs have been a part of the univer-
sity for at least the last fifteen years, but Chicana/Latina studies
classes and books have become available only very recently.

Subject:      Re: WHAT'S IN A NAME?

I wish I had more time to write to you about your problems, but, alas, I have
only a few minutes, and I usually don't answer questions from the list.  But
here goes, briefly.  In the beginning, we chose between "women's studies,"
"female studies," and "feminist studies," and chose the word that would
signify dignity, for we were still being called "girls."  In the beginning,
women's studies meant the study of "women and gender."  We all took this for
granted in the early 1970s, and people either laughed at us or ignored us.  A
few were hostile, but for the most part, we could at least get started
without having to fight about the words.  I think you are quite right about
insisting on "women's studies," since you are adding to the curriculum what
has been traditionally omitted: the study of women as a group, with all their
differences, and the study of women's relationships to men--a significant
aspect of gender.  Go to it: there is lots of material as well as 620 women's
studies programs in a list just coming out of Women's Studies Quarterly to
help you.  Florence Howe   (Florench@aol.com)

Thanks to everyone who sent lists of resources.  And thank you to Sheila Hughes
of Emory who sent the following message.  You accurately reflected the request
I made and the situation.

******************************************************************************

It might be useful at this point in our discussion to revisit Sharon
Snow's initial request regarding Chicana feminism.

First, she asked for an article, not a book (as many or most respondents
are claiming or assuming). Does this make a difference?

Second, she clearly stated that she is teaching an Intro to WS course.
This may involve lecturing to a large class.  Does this make a difference?
Do any of us teaching Intro to WS courses expect to be experts in every
area (cultural or disciplinary) to which we "introduce" our students?

Finally, she explained that she was planning a class session on
"feminist theory" (which doesn't necessarily comprise a major component of
every intro class).  Why assume (as a number of us seem to have done) that
material by and about Chicanas won't be included in other parts of the
course?

Let's remember, too, that many of those teaching introductory-level
courses are graduate students without the privilege of decades-long
careers and the luxury of teaching only (or perhaps ever!) in their fields
of specialty.  Does this make a difference?

Please, can we listen to each other a little more closely???

Just my two bits,

Sheila

I just read the chicana feminism thread from start to finish, and of
course I've got to throw in my two cents:

 I reproduced Sharon's post that started this thread above.  I think that
conversations on the list really go haywire when people half-read a
message, or forget the original message, letting replies like Daphne's
re-define the conversation.   Sharon says she's teaching an intro class,
is using a MULTICULTURAL perspective, and hasn't given any info specific
enough for anybody to infer her ideas about race or anything else.  Many
people simply assumed the worst--whatever the worst was from their
perspective.  Daphne's reply was really insulting, *assuming* that Sharon
wouldn't even *read* the material she was asking for suggestions on!
That's just plain mean.

Undergraduate Intro classes can't include everything, and people can't be
experts in everything.  Period.    And how does anyone know that other
feminisms wouldn't be surveyed in *lecture* or other books,  and that
Sharon was simply looking for an especially relevant ARTICLE to assign as
a supplement?  They didn't, and that's why the shape the conversation
took is troubling to me.   It's really insulting to just *assume* that
she hasn't thought about the racial politics of pedagogy issues you've
been bringing up, and the conversation is continuing as if a really
ignorant "straw professor" said  "I'm teaching an intro course, and just
because there are Mexican-Americans in there I think the ONLY time I will
deal with race will be to assign one ethnicity-appropriate article, IF
that group is present".  She DIDN'T say that.  But some people reacted
like she did.

Using the simple request for an article as a jumping off point for a
discussion about racial politics in feminist teaching is useful, and of
course we're all concerned with the quality of teaching-- but this has
really strayed from the original request.   Maybe change the subject line
and continue it as a separate discussion?


Cheers,
Chelsea

Subject:      black IQ test

Hello!

I will soon be discussing how gender, race, and class affect educational
placements with my graduate students. I would like to give the students the
chance to take the "Black IQ Test." Does anyone know where I can find the
test or any bibliographic info. such as who wrote it?

Interestingly, when IQ tests were first developed , girls did better on them
than boys. The tests were then "adjusted" to raise boys' scores (and these
tests are now often biased against girls). And of course the tests are
biased in favor of whites.

Thank you.

     FYI, the following is forwarded from another news list.
     Unbelievable.  (This will be a show-stopper in any

        ***  HALF-WITLESS NEWS . . . .    Of Newt Gingrich's
        two half-sisters, Candace -- his better lesbian half
        -- is also the better known.  However, Susan Gingrich
        -- Newt's conservative and heterosexual half-sister
        -- has announced plans for making a media splash of
        her own.

        To counter the "liberal bias of American women's
        magazines," Susan Gingrich intends to launch a new
        publication -- "Today's Lady."  "We will not have any
        male bashing,'' she explains.  "It will be a magazine
        that will always look at women as being victors,
        never victims; we're not going to have sad stories
        about women being abused and mistreated.''

        According to Reuters (Sept. 12), the first issue of
        "Today's Lady" is due out next Spring.  Gingrich is
        "considering story ideas on such topics as etiquette,
        children's health, women and guns, Christian diet
        programs and what it means to be a lady today."

Femme Talk!!! Sojourner--a national, feminist newpaper--is producing a
special issue on the underexplored and never-tired topic of femmes!!! We
are looking for submissions (about 1800 words or so, on average) by femmes
on the following topics or any others about femmes that grab your fancy.
Some ideas: femmes/femme relationships, stereotypes about femme
manipulation of butches, sexism within lesbian/bi/queer communities against
femmes, femme desire, femme identities as they intersect with race, class,
and age, differences between young women's conceptions of femmes and older
women's, femme fatales, femmes on TV (are those girly dykes really femmes
or straight women masquerading as lesbians--what are the advantages and
disadvantages of the visibility of less-butch women as dykes in the popular
media/film etc.?), what's it like to be a bi femme, a heterosexual femme,
and everything else. Articles can be fiction, journalistic, interviews,
reviews, whatever you like!!

Submissions are due to Sojourner by October 3. Call Stephanie at
617-524-0415 for more info. Write us at sojourn@tiac.net (put Stephanie in
the subject box so I get the message)--we like to get submissions by email
(just cut and paste article into the message box). We pay $15 per article
we print plus a one year sub to the paper and all that glory!!!!

Thanks and please pass the word!!!

anyone teach using personal narratives to illustrate practice issues,
skills, psychopathology, family problems, developmental issues, etc.?
How do you use them? Does anyone know if there is a book, a compilation of
narratives geared toward teaching students in the helping professions,
which would include questions for discussion, exercises based on
individual narratives, etc. Please respond privately to jessica heriot,

IQ tests are standardized so that men and women both have an average
score of 100.  How does this produce bias?  I go around with this when
I present the test score "adjustment" to students.  How do you know--
how does anybody know--whether the present day IQ test or the early
nonadjusted version of the test is more valid as a measure of
intelligence?  Terman adjusted the score because he thought there
was no good reason why the average score for men and women should be
different.  I'm just thankful that a true misogynist (say, Freud)
wasn't bringing his theoretical baggage to the revision of the test.

One thing that psychologists do not make clear is that they are
always tinkering around with these tests.  Items go in, come out,
get changed.  --And as with Terman, these revisions reflect
theoretical positions.

Here's a great question to ask in class: if it's appropriate to do
this test revision to equalize average scores for men and women,
why not do a similar revision to equalize scores across races?  I
for one know of no plausible reason why intelligence should be
distributed differently across races.  People who support the
idea of racial differences never really provide a theory--they
simply point to IQ test scores.  But assumptions are always
embedded in psychological tests.  Always.  And the fact that
racial differences are treated as meaningful differences rather
than as errors to be corrected on the test reflects a particular
theoretical position.

I am new to the list and have found this to be an excellent forum for some
issues that I am facing as a new teacher.  I am a graduate student in
Sociology, and have been assigned to teach a social problems course this
year.  I have already taught one session of the course (in the summer),
and, naturally, had my share of problems.  Our department gives us some
preparation before we are put in the classroom, but I really had the
feeling of being "thrown to the wolves", so to speak, once i got there.
No one can really teach you how to deal with problems like confrontational
students and issues of authority.

I have friends in other departments (mostly women) who are dealing with
similar problems.  We have talked about getting an organization started at
our university that would offer support to students who are also teachers.
I was wondering if any other universitieshad any group similar to what we
are thinking about.  If so, how is it run?  We were thinking of suggesting
readings, like hooks' "Teaching to Transgress", and maybe making each
meeting a place where people can bring up issues or problems and they can
be discussed by the group.

Anyway, any suggestions for organizing the group or for possible readings
would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

The best book I know for your purposes is Carol Franz and Abby Stewart, Eds.
(1994).  Women creating lives: Identities, resilience, and resistance.  San
Francisco: Westview.  You might also want to look at a new book that I edited
with Mary Crawford called In our own words published by McGraw Hill in 1997.
This is meant more as a set of narratives for a general psych of women class,
but it is probably easier to read than the Franz and Stewart book (we use two
of their pieces in our collection).  Hope this helps.  Rhoda Unger

I have been asked to do a talk on the relationship between activism and
academics. I teach irregularly in Women's Studies, and my field is law,
though my activism is primarily peace/anti-nuke.  I am acquainted with
bell hooks and some others who write about feminist and anti-racist
activism, and some of the controversery in conservation biology about
these issues.  I am wondering whether anyone could recommend any recent
articles that speak to combining/tensions between the two.

Thanks.

        Greetings:

        A student minoring in WS asked if I could request some information
from the esteemed readers (and writers) on this list regarding a paper she
is preparing for an Intro to WS course..

        She seeks information regarding wives of men in the military--in
particular, navy wives--and issues surrounding their emotional well-being.
She is also interested in the difficulties faced by military wives and couples.

        If you've any suggestions, could you please respond privately to me
and I will pass your ideas, comments, suggestions along.  Thanks much.

Hi,

>    Although Ruth and I agree about many things, I don't see her concern about
>adding a reading to a syllabus the way she does.

I probably posted my original note in too much haste, for I indeed had not
seen the request to which Daphne's post was a response, and therefore
did reply somewhat off-topic (or thus changing the topic), for which I
apologize.

>    Ruth, you seem to assume as Daphne does that the teachers will use the
>reading as "the right" representation of Chicana women/feminists.

Hmmm, not sure that I think the teacher will intend to use it this way,
but I do believe that no matter what the teacher intends, some number
of students will perceive it this way. (not all, but some - and I do
worry about those 'some'...)

 Why not
>assume instead that the teacher 1) has knowledge about Chicanas/os but
>doesn't know of a reading appropriate for a intro WS course, which she
>requested;

Again, I didn't mean to imply or assume this about the original poster
who requested the material;  I responded too quickly, because I did
not realize that Daphne's response was to a particular person, in response
to a particular request.  Again, my apologies.

OTOH, I think this might not be a good assumption to make, in general,
about many (most?) teachers of WS in the USA.  I wish that weren't true,
and hope we are collectively & individually each working toward the day
when it will not be true, but don't think we are there yet...

>2) will use the reading to raise critical questions about the
>contents;

I'm sure most of us DO try to do this ... but (again) not sure that
we actually succeed as grandly or as often as we try.  (I sure don't.)
And even when I, personally, DO try my very best to do this, I'm still
*very* hesitant to try to do it when the reading comes from a perspective
with which I am deeply umfamiliar (when that is the case).  What I
worry about (speaking only for myself here, but assuming that my own
experience is not unique to me alone) is that what I even perceive
to be "relevant" or "critical questions" or "the contents" might
themselves be off-the-mark just because of my own unfamiliarity with
the entire context of the reading and the perspective from which it
is written.  Even if I keep my own mouth shut, there is always the
possibility that I will (accidentally) "reinforce" the kinds of
questions, etc. that reverberate with my OWN perspective, knowledge,
experience, etc. (i.e., through interested looks, minor tilts of the
head at some questions & not at others, etc.) ... and because of the
power of the teacher in the classroom, those things still DO matter.
It makes it WORSE if I (as the teacher) am uninformed enough that I
(in these subtle ways) actually convey to students (somehow) that my
own biases are somehow "The Right" kind of perspective to take...  AAAAK!

3)understands that many representations of a group totalize that
>group and knows to look for that and alert students to it if it's in a
>text;

God, do I WISH!  (Again, speaking only for myself, but suspecting that I am
not totally unique in this respect) ... if this were true, then it would
not be necessary for one after another after another "group" to spell out
all the ways, times, places, etc. that they experience "invisible"
totalizing by totally un-conscious writers, theorists, etc. (including
WS authors & professors, etc.), nor would it be necessary for me to read
all of the works which do this.  I could simply for once and for all
come to that single understanding, and then "get it right" every time,
about everybody, in every text (& situation, & in my own speech, etc.).
Alas, history (including my personal history of having my own biases
pointed out, sometimes painfully, by people whom they have hurt) tells
me that I'd better not assume this -- I'd better make my own working
assumptions go in the other direction, as it (a) is far more likely
to be closer to the truth, and (b) would be far better to err in that
direction than in the other.  So I try always to start out with
the assumption that I am NOT AT ALL aware of ALL my own (internalized)
biases, prejudices, ignorances and "-isms" etc. ... and if I act (as a
teacher) in a way that presumes that I AM already so aware, then
I am probably doing more harm than good.

>4)knows about authors' point of view and teaches students to look for
>that;

Again, I think we ALL try to do this ... but see above...  And is this
enough?  Is that all we mean by a cultural perspective?

>5)will read as many of the books recommended on wmst as she can

>the syllabus;

Again, I do not doubt this; sorry if I gave that impression.

6)will prepare reasonably well before that reading comes

Ditto, above.

Again, I am not attributing that to the particular individual original
requester -- and certainly did not mean to give that impression, and
apologize if I did.  OTOH, is this not (alas, still) a reasonable
assumption to make about most teachers in the USA?  If you assumed
that about me, you would not be wrong.  (Am I the only such dinosaur
left?)  I *am* the product of my own personal intellectual and cultural
history; cannot escape that (probably don't even want to try).  And
no matter how "aware" I am of that, my perspective still *is* MINE
.. I cannot be elsewhere than within my own self.

Your other point (no monolithic "US perspective") I surely agree with.
There is something there that I am trying to say though, but I don't
know what exactly it is or how to say it.

Yes, of course I agree.

Yes, absolutely.  I really struggle with the problem of the "excluded
'others'" in courses like Intro WS.  I am fully aware that no matter
WHAT I teach, there will ALWAYS be significantly important groups of
excluded 'others' who don't make it into the syllabus, discourse, etc.
as fully as they should (or even at all).  I cannot imagine that there
is any solution such as talking only about "generic women" so that
"nobody" is excluded (or so that "everybody" is "included").  That
has HUGE problems of its own.  But then constructing a syllabus starts
to seem (to me) like an exercise in "deciding whom to exclude" -- and I
absolutely HATE getting into that "stuck" mindset either.
(Ideas/approaches/solutions re. this general issue welcomed by me,
anytime.  This really bothers me every single time I have to construct a
syllabus, and since I've been teaching full time for 10+ years now, that's
getting to be a lot of times.)

Hmmm ... I envy you the diversity of backgrounds & experience which
I suspect that you find in your classrooms (at CUNY?).  UNFORTUNATELY,
most of the classrooms in which I've found myself really *lack*
this diversity in a Big Way, which I take to be one of the most
difficult teaching challenges I face on a regular basis (i.e., how
to compensate for this unfortunate fact, until it is no longer true).

        Women Make Music in the Hills of Southeastern Ohio


Athens, OH--The Women's Studies Program and the School of Music at Ohio
University will be hosting a nationwide, interdisciplinary conference in
October featuring world-renown composers, musicologists, and women's
studies scholars.  "Women in Music:  A Celebration of the Last One Hundred
Years," an academic/performance conference, will be held Thursday, October
23, 1997, through Sunday, October, 26, 1997, in Athens, Ohio, and will
feature scholarly/musical presentations on a variety of themes and topics
in the area of women in music.

The conference will feature award-winning composer Joan Tower, whose bold,
energetic music has won her huge audiences, and composer Judith Lang
Zaimont, internationally recognized for her dramatic and vibrant works.
The conference will include papers on and presentations of the work of both
composers. Susan Cook, coauthor of Cecelia Reclaimed:  Feminist
Perspectives on Gender and Music, and now researching Billie Holliday, will
be speaking  as will noted musicologist and writer Elizabeth Wood,
biographer of suffragist and composer Ethel Smyth. All four women will be
present at the closing panel on Sunday.

There will also be evening entertainment by  Diva:  No Man's Band (a New
York City-based all-woman Big Band); Mexican American singer and songwriter
Tish Hinajosa; the highly acclaimed Lark String Quartet; and the Local
Girls, a vocal swing trio.  Some of these performers will also conduct
workshops during the conference.

Aileen Hall, director of the Ohio University Women's Stuides Program, noted
that registration data reflect the wide variety of people attending the
conference.  "Not only is the conference attracting women's studies and
music students, but it is also appealing to people interested in music
production, performance, and comparative arts. For example, we will have
papers on women in rock  n roll, the operatic efforts of Gertrude Stein,
band music by women, the work of Joan Tower, Dolly Parton, and women as
performers and consumers." She added that the conference will be looking at
the nature of women's impact on music and the difference, if any, that
gender makes.

Dr. Hall said  that "the range of compositions is impressive.  For example,
we will have piano music of American women composers; a session on extended
vocal techniques; poems set to music; and  lecture-recitals on the music of
Tania Leon, Rebecca Clarke, and many others.  Best of all, we will have
composers who will be present when their compositions are performed, many
for the first time."

"We also expect," she  noted, "that the conference offerings will showcase
the students and faculty at the School of Music and will contribute to
encouraging interdisciplinary scholarship, particularly between the
humanities and fine arts."

Richard Linn, a violinist-conductor, is serving as the conference
coordinator.  Dr. Linn said that "the conference is unique in that it will
bring together people with quite varied interests--all, in some way,
related to the status of women in music.  We are providing a forum for
performing artists and composers to meet those with scholarly interests,
thereby presenting a more complete picture of women and their role in the
past, present, and future of music."

Preregistration for the October conference is strongly encouraged.  Fees
include one-day rates, and a full conference package includes evening
entertainment. The fee for university faculty rate is $45.00 for the entire
conference (includes daytime events only), and students, who also must
register, will be admitted free to daytime events. To register, contact the
Women in Music Conference, Office of Continuing Education, Ohio University,
102 Haning Hall, Athens, OH 45701.

The entire conference program will be available on the women in music
conference web page:  http://ouvaxa.cats.ohiou.edu/~hudsonl/music.html. You

The Program on the Status and Education of Women at the Association of American
 Colleges and Universities, in collaboration with the American Council on
 Education*s Office of Women in Higher Education, NAWE: Advancing Women in
 Higher Education, and HERS, Mid-America, is pleased to announce the following
 conference:


Women*s Leadership:   Changing Concepts of Power
Washington, DC:    November 13-15, 1997

Description and Rationale:
Emerging in many different locales, women leaders are visible on every college
 campus.  As presidents, academic and student affairs leaders, and chairs of
 departments; as heads of faculty senates and unions and members of women*s
 commissions; as directors of women*s studies programs and of research
 institutes; in finance, admissions and athletics.  Their presence has been
 critical to higher education and its renewal.

How have academic women used power and how have they come to reconceptualize the
 meaning of leadership and power?  What difference has women*s leadership made
 in shaping how we do business on a campus or in the world at large?  What
 policies and practices are necessary to sustain women and their contributions
 to institutional development?  How have men been important allies in promoting
 women as leaders?  What new understandings about our interconnections across
 differences must all leaders in higher education cultivate if we are to create
 vibrant, robust communities in our increasingly diverse world?

We invite researchers, women in leadership positions, and those men and women
 interested in promoting, sustaining, and enlarging the role of women in
 leadership positions to join us in discussing these questions.  We also
 encourage institutions to bring a team of leaders from different positions
 within the academy and use the conference as an opportunity for strategic
 planning for your institution.  We welcome student participation and offer a
 special $50 student registration rate.

Designed to be conceptual, practical, and research-based, the conference is one
 of a series of events scheduled during Women*s Leadership Month (see below).

What you will gain from attending the conference:

*    How to think about leadership in a broader sense
*    How to maximize your personal potential
*    How to connect to national networks of women leaders
*    How to shape policies and practices to sustain women leaders in their work
*    How to develop a diverse network of supportive advocates and allies

We are in the process of instituting a gender studies major at the
University of Texas at Dallas.  In order to make a case for the major
to various state boards that must approve it, we are looking for
job placement statistics for women's/gender studies graduates.  We need
to make the case that such graduates are, in fact, employable to win
the votes we need to get the program approved.   NWSA does not keep
these statistics.  If your program keeps these kinds of records and you
would be willing to share them, please contact me off-list.

I am putting together an interdisciplinary course for advanced
undergraduates on gender and education in the spring.  I am looking for
a readable, one-volume history of women and education in America (if
such a thing exists!).  I am familiar with Barbara Solomon's _In the
Company of Educated Women_, Linda Gordon's work on higher education in
the progressive era, and Helen Horowitz' work on women's colleges.  Is
there good historical work on primary/secondary education for women?

I am also drowning in essay collections on this topic.  If you have
taught with one you thought worked particularly well, could you send
the title and the reasons you liked it my way off-list?  I'd be happy
to send a summary to the list if there's interest.

Thanks,

 The History Department and the Women's Studies Program of the University
of Central Florida is joining with the Orange Country Historical Museum to
sponsor a conference in October 1998.  The conference will be held at the
Museum, and is planned to begin on a Thursday evening and run through
Sunday morning.

    This interdisciplinary history conference will be entitled Florida
Women in Their Material Worlds.  The conference focuses on the experiences
of women in Florida, from pre-conquest to the present, and offers much of
interest to both scholars and practitioners throughout Florida.  We hope
to have a wide range of participants.  Those attending will not only
discuss cutting-edge work in scholarly and teaching fields, but will also
have time for networking and exchanging ideas within affinity groups.  We
offer a special invitation to teachers to attend on Saturday, a day on
which we plan to emphasize sessions relevant to teaching Florida history
and social studies.  We also hope to provide a free workbook for teachers.

    We welcome proposals that address themes such as the following:
        the place of women and gender in Florida history,
            including pre-contact and during Spanish rule
        the Florida/ southern home and the material worlds of
            women
        the Florida/ southern frontier, Native Americans and
            settlers, and the material worlds of women
        changing economic circumstances and roles of Florida women
            and men
        interacting with the Florida environment and geography
        photographs and poster displays as a means of capturing
            womens material worlds
        teaching women and gender in school Florida history
            courses
        gender, race, and ethnicity in Florida history
        race, ethnicity, class, and gender in the transformation
            of Florida/ South after World War II
        womens rights and civil rights
        women, literature, and their material worlds in Florida
            and the south.

    We welcome comparative papers and multi-media presentations,
including photo and poster displays and artifacts.  We welcome individual
submissions as well as suggestions for complete panels, and we welcome
nominations for panel chairs and discussants.  Except for multi-media
presentations, we expect each speaker to limit comments to 20 minutes (12
pp.).  Selected papers from the conference will be published.

    We urge all persons interested in participating to contact us.
For information or to submit a proposal, please contact Ms. Kerry Kennedy
at the Orange County Historical Museum, 812 E. Rollins St., Orlando, FL,
32803; telephone 407-897-6350.

    I am on an internal committee at my Health Department(at which I
am a community health nurse), called Together Against Oppression.  Last
year we put on a senior staff sanctioned mandatory workshop on homophobia
and heterosexism.  I could say alot about that, but the point of this
request for input is now we are planning to do antioppression/diversity
training ... sort of like oppression 101.  Has anyone done this kind of work?
What works best?  I'm stressing over the thought of a workshop, we all
know that this does little if anything to enable attitudinal shifts.  The
audience would be community health nurses, health inspectors, community
development workers, health promoters, supervisors, and support staff.
The primary audience is baccalaureate prepared nurses.

    Any guidance, insights , suggestions, and direction would be helpful.
Thankyou in advance, Cheryl.

The National Coalition Building Institute does good workshops and
train-the-trainer sessions that start from the ways in which each of us
feels different and, as a result, sometimes oppressed.  Their exercises are
non-threatening but powerful.  Theor phone # is (202) 785-9400.

ESTUDIOS QUEER EN BUENOS AIRES

    Comenzara a funcionar este mismo sabado el Area de Estudios
Culturales Queer y Multiculturalismo del Centro Cultural R.
Rojas de la Universidad de Buenos Aires.
     Como respuesta a una sociedad patriarcal que impone la
normativizacion de los individuos y a una politica gay lesbica que
propone la asimilacion e integracion a esa cultural a traves de un
reformismo conformista, surge la teoria politica/cultural queer.
Esta teoria propone la construccion de una nueva cultura a traves de
un discurso confrontativo que cuestiona al sistema patriarcal desde
sus axiomas.  Se~nala la necesidad de crear nuevas formas de relacion
basadas en  la libertad y la celebracion de las diferencias
originadas por el deseo erotico y la identidad sexual y generica,
entre otras.
De la misma manera, el multiculturalismo propone una sincera
valoracion igualitaria de las diferentes culturas raciales y Thetatnicas
que implique no solo el respeto de las mismas sino tambiThetan el festejo
por su rica diversidad.
    Abriremos este espacio con la presencia de David William
Foster, de la Universidad del Estado de Arizona (EEUU) quien nos
expondra su trabajo: "Homoeroticas: Teoria y Aplicaciones".

    "Si el patriarcado y su ideologia dominante, el heterosexismo
compulsivo, se fundamentan en esquemas promulgados como universales y
sempiternos, le incumbe a lo queer manejar una etica del conocimiento
que admita la mas amplia variedad posible de interpretaciones y de
elaborar modelos de conocimiento que puedan romper con el
autoritarismo, tanto el epistemologico como el sociopolitico (anverso
y reverso de la misma moneda en cuanto a como se sustentan
mutuamente). Conformarse con las limitaciones en cuanto a
lo que se puede conocer y prescindir de las tecnologias de control
que permite el sistema patriarcal, sin principios claros de lo queer.
    [...]
    La division social entre hombres y mujeres, entre cuerpos
masculinos y femeninos, responde indudablemente a caracteristicas
biologicas, las que, si no son siempre tan determinantes como se
quiciera pensar, sirven grosso modo para una clasificacion ajustada a
criterios de los cuerpos.  Esta division responde, tambien,
indudablemente, a las necesidades de la reproduccion biologica.
    Lo que no queda claro es por que esta division tiene que ser la
base de toda la organizacion social ..., lo queer se preocupa por las
razones por las cuales cada espera de la sociedad tiene que ser
organizada desde la optica de una diferenciacion que solo propicia la
reproduccion, por que cualquier desviacion de este sistema taxonomico
se considera una perversion, y como podrian ser las relaciones entre
los cuerpos si el rasgo distintivo de lo reproductivo no fuera basico
y se cediera ante otros posibles sistemas de clasificacion del cuerpo
o si se suspendiera estrategicamente el imperativo de las
clasificaciones.
    La division hegemonica entre hombres y mujeres es un hecho
ideologico que lo queer no puede dejar de tomar en cuenta.  Hace
falta incluso apoyar tal division respecto de ciertos dominios de la
teorizacion y de la praxis social.  Por ejemplo, es incuestionable
que los hombres gay y las mujeres lesbianas no comparten la misma
historia mas alla del punto de referencia basico de su opresion
sangrienta.  Se puede insistir en que "la lesbiana no es una mujer"
(Monique Wittig) a los efectos de recalcar como "hombre" y "mujer"
son constructos del patriarcado y como la definicion del patriarcado
de la lesbiana va siempre en su desmedro.  Pero la sociedad trata a
las lesbianas como mujeres, con toda la discriminacion a la que se
somete a estas.  Y, despues de todo, la sociedad trata a los hombres
gay como a hombres, con el poder relativo superior que tiene el
hombre.  Es util debatir en torno a quienes sufren mas represiones,
los hombres gay o las lesbianas, pero queda fuera de duda que la
mujer siempre ocupa una posicion de relativa inferioridad, y
una meditacion sobre como las arbitrariedades de la division sexual
no puede, con todo, hacer caso omiso a este hecho historico."   David
William Foster , "Produccion Cultural e Identidades Homoeroticas:
Teoria y Aplicaciones." (1995).

    Las y los esperamos este sabado a las 16 horas, en el Centro
Cultural R. Rojas,  para escuchar y debatir esta propuesta teorica .
    Festejaremos la inaguraci'on del Area el dia 27 de junio con una

Chelsea Starr is right on the money! I am increasingly disturbed by the
extent to which people demonstrate both a careless reading of a post, and a
willingness to use a few key phrases as a jumping-off point from which to
launch their own agendas. It's disrepectful to the original poster.
Chelsea's point about at least changing the heading to reflect an
essentially new thread is well-taken. And Daphne's skill at distorting the
meaning of a post never surprises me as much as does the fact that people
continue to fall for it. I can see it now, in a future book, something
along the lines of " Women's studies faculty routinely sacrifice scholarly
rigor in the interests of political correctness. Under intense pressure to
"teach inclusively", teachers prepare for "multi-cultural approaches" by
hastily adding articles culled from last-minute e-mail posts."

Or something along those lines.

Why are Claire'simagined lines not, in fact, an accurate description
of the problem I was attempting to call attention to? Are people
pretending this does not in fact happen?  As for reading carefully,
by now it seems to have become official that I did indeed suppose that the
original poster was not even going to READ the material suggested
to her by the list.  That thought never crossed my mind and was
definitely NOT in my original response.  Claire's posting has helped
the discussion descend further toward personal attacks.  Another
fine moment in the history of feminist debates about serious issues
such as the nature of women's studies pedagogy.

I want to put in my $.02 on the National Coalition Building Institute.
 I've been a part of their anti-oppression trainings and I find their
approach problematic.  Their exercises are non-threatening because they
fail to do a power analysis of oppression.  So the message is 'we are all
hurt by oppression and we're one big human family' rather than 'those of us
in positions of power have a special responsibility to end sexism, racism,
homophobia, etc.  I find their approach very undermining in settings where
an accountability process has begun with those in power -

Suzanne Pharr's book, Homophobia, A Weapon of Sexism offers good
consciousness-raising exercises on sexism, racism and homophobia.  Also
Margo Adair has a book out whose title I can't remember.

Good luck!

bonjour,

i'm trying to constitute a feminist filmography and having difficulty
locating the films themselves.
i was specifically interested in the work of Ulrike Ottinger.
does anyone know if these films are available through distribution in North
America?
the titles that most interest me at the moment are:
Bildnis einer Trinkerin (1979) (english title is Ticket of No Return)
Joanna D'Arc of Mongolia
=46reak Orlando
Madame X

I'm replying to the list, as I think others might be interested in
this also.
The Vanier Institute of the Family (a nonprofit organization in
Canada) developed the following "working definition" of a family in
1992:
Any combination of two or more persons who are bound together by ties
of mutual consent, birth, and/or adoption/placement and who,
together, assume responsibilities for variant combinations of some of
the following: physical maintenance and care of group members;
addition of new members through procreation or adoption;
socialization of children; social control of members; production,
consumption, and distribution of goods and services; and affective
nuturance.

Audre Lorde Legacy Awards Program
Expanding in its Third Year


The Union Institute Center for Women is accepting applications for its
third annual Audre Lorde Legacy Award and for the new Audre Lorde
Fellowship for Women of Color Writer/Activists.

This is the inaugural year for the Audre Lorde Fellowship which awards a
month-long residency at Norcroft: A Writing Retreat for Women and a $1,000
stipend.  Successful applicants will have a history of social change
activism and an ongoing commitment to writing fiction, non-fiction or
poetry.  In keeping with Audre Lorde's Legacy, we are looking for women of
color whose work breaks new ground and provides essential sustenance to
women working for justice in their communities.  This fellowship is made
possible by a gift from the Harmony Women's Fund (MN).

For the third consecutive year, the Center for Women will award its $3,000
Audre Lorde Legacy Award to an individual or organization doing exemplary
work which meshes scholarship and activism for the benefit of women and/or
girls.  Last year's legacy award winner, Mankuba Ramalepe, was recognized
for her outstanding research and organizing work with rural South African
women who are creating village-based health care centers.  In the program's
pilot year, the Hartford, Connecticut-based Institute for Community
Research was awarded the prize for its innovative mother-daughter substance
abuse prevention program created by women living in Hartford's inner-city
neighborhoods.

Last year, thirty applicants applied for the Legacy Award addressing such
issues as welfare rights organizing, fighting right-wing hate violence,
organizing women through the internet, advocating for women in the trades,
and developing cultural community through the arts.

I  find messages of this type to be of little use at best and destructive
of effective discussion.  Daphne raised and important issue about the role
of expertise and choices of materials that is especially important in
newer fields that seek greater academic respect.  That same issue was
raised in a post about 'Mean are from..." and it is one that deserves
serious attention.  I happen to believe that claims of expertise act more
as territorial protection than assurance of quality in many instances.  I
also believe that all of us, regardless of experience and credentials are
subject to using erroneous information or using information in a way
that is misleading. The issue of how we can employ self-correcting and
external correcting mechanisms to reduce the probability of misleading
students is worthy of serious attention. In the instance, I suggest
that posts that offend some sensibility be responded to substantively.
I also suggest that responses should not be confined to the specific
questions asked--that limits discussion too much. Finally, I do agree
that we often may too little heed to the subject line.

The question of whether teachers in colleges and universities
do our homework is not one for Women's Studies faculty alone.

This listserv involves people from a variety of places, all of whom are
concerned with Women's Studies teaching and scholarship.  Why must we honor
or even address the assumption that we are automatically going to do something
half-assed?

Yes, some people do, I am sure.
But why is that the *operative* assumption about Women's Studies faculty?
Women's Studies programs are not the world's repository for half-assed
scholars and teachers.  They are everywhere.

Impugning the competence of all Women's Studies faculty (who,
according to Daphne Patai, may be in thrall to some notion of diversity
and so chuck in politically appropriate readings at the drop of a hat) is not
exactly what I think of as a "feminist debate."

Thanks, Jaime. I was really upset by the description "the ways in which
each of us feels different and, as a result, sometimes oppressed" for the
reason you named -- a failure to do a power analysis. Each of us may
occasionally _feel_ "different" but some of us have to power to define,
enact and enforce "norm/normal" and the privilege to not have to live
inside "different" on an ongoing basis. So, yeah, what's to be
threatening about not challenging real privilege and the unacknowledged
power that goes with it? Some of us may _feel_ oppressed (like the white
males who occupy 90% of the leadership positions in the professions and
industry may feel put upon because they have to not harass their staffs),
but some folks really _are_ oppressed and many of us really do
participate (consciously or not) in and/or benefit from oppression of others.

So, that's my added $.02 (on a thread that Joan will soon tell us should
be continued elsewhere).

I've finally remembered a book I wanted to recommend in response to the
discussion of "....Women Are From Venus."  I have not read this one but
have read, and not appreciated, Deborah Tannen's earlier work on
male/female communication.

A less pop-psych book, and one with more political analysis, is Robin
Lakoff's Language and Woman's Place, published in 1975.   I think she has
some more recent work out on the subject as well.  I would feel very
comfortable using this in a course and, alas, it still seems fairly
contemporary.

And I'd like to add:

I was horrified when one of my famous, tenured, non-feminist
literature professors did precisely what we are decrying as the ultimate
in shoddy teaching: he handed his TAs an article and told us to
summarize it for the undergraduates JUST TO TAKE UP CLASS TIME while he
went off to a conference. He had a reputation to protect, and yet he
knew he could get away with this, and more. The article, believe it or
not, was not even about the novel the students were reading for class: it
was irrelevant to the course and completely inappropriate for freshmen.
Graduate students in our department were ROUTINELY told to spend as little
time on class prep as possible, lest we develop reputations as teachers
rather than scholars (supposedly the kiss of death). Somehow, it
was assumed that teaching and scholarship never go together! Finally, in
my experience, much non-feminist scholarship distorts its subject matter
by taking the prof's tiny, myopic research specialty as the focus and
never conveying "the big picture" to the students.

I have found feminist discussion of pedagogy refreshing because, unlike
the cynical careerists who are often rewarded by the system, the feminists
at least seem to CARE about the rigour, balance and effectiveness of
classroom presentation. My non-feminist profs were notorious for
neglecting undergraduate education altogether: they tended to believe it
was "beneath them" to CONNECT their advanced scholarship with the basic
questions vital for beginners (often the "so what?" "why is this
important?" questions). My point is that if we criticize
ourselves (multicultural feminists) for integrating new material too
quickly--and we integrate this new material not out of some compulsion
to be p.c. but in order to achieve a more accurate, less biased
presentation of the subject matter--we should also remember that
patriarchal scholarship is a very mixed bag with some useful models and
some very misleading models of what "solid scholarship" must be.
I agree with William's comment about the "territorial" nature of
expertise, ie. expertise does not equal quality control. Besides dealing
with new material (which throws our "authority" off balance) and
overcoming our own biases, we must constantly pick and choose our methods,
without clear-cut models OR institutional recognition when we do manage to
"get it right."

Why do some of us have to assimilate new material rapidly in order not to
pass on biases, distortions and omissions to our students? In my case,
it's because the material was excluded from the curriculum when I was
receiving my "higher education." The educator must be educated somehow,
and the risks of that involve both "growing pains" and the possible
loss of one's sense of authority, one's reputation for scholarly
rigour and sometimes one's faith in the university itself as a site of
real education. My experience has been that the university rewards the
reproduction of knowledge and disciplinary continuity. Its rituals and
stability are threatened by the production of genuinely new knowledge and
especially by the recognition of new (hitherto excluded), unauthorized
SOURCES of knowledge who may be outside its control and who may spoil its
control and monopoly on knowledge. (I am drawing on the ideas of one of
my favorite patriarchs, Walter Benjamin.) At the same time, the
university, as a liberal institution, must at least pay lip service to new
knowledge. So multicultural feminism is tolerated but devalued, so it can
be kept under control. Multicultural feminism is a work-in-progress. I,
too, am critical of hasty or superficial assimilation of new material, but
I also know it is not something of which feminists are uniquely guilty (as
Maria pointed  out). And for feminists, it is a result of the
"in-progress" nature of the beast. There must be a way to critique that
work-in-progress without participating in the devaluation of the work
itself.

Finally, I agree with Vera that we also need to look at the institutional,
social and personal conditions that might speed up or promote that
work-in-progress such as collaborative teaching and departments that
really DO have, for instance, a Chicana specialist. Many departments are
hopelessly backward in hiring practices, and many of us have no say in
hiring. So we have to invite outside speakers, which is not necessarily a
bad thing, because it means we can be innovative. In fact, one
constructive idea might be to compile a regional list of activists,
artists and other speakers with the time and desire to
visit our classrooms. Sometimes I'm lucky enough to have the name of a
good contact or potential speaker (in which case I usually have a great
class that really inspires the students); but sometimes I'm clueless
about where to find an outside speaker to visit my class. Any
suggestions? A databank of potential speakers might be very helpful. Does
such a thing exist?

Many apologies for this lengthy post...

GENDER/ WOMEN'S STUDIES PROGRAM ABROAD IN COSTA RICA - 1998

"Community Development and Social Change in Costa Rica - The Evolving Role
of Women in the Development of a Rural Costa Rican Region"

Second Annual Course Program
Instituto Monteverde (IMV)
Monteverde, Costa Rica

Dates for 1998:
Semester Course:  Feb. 1 - May 23
Summer Session:  June 25 - August 9

Application Deadlines:
Semester Course:  November 28, 1997
Summer Session:  April 15, 1998
Courses are limited to 12 students each session.

Academic Credit:
Semester Course:  14 Semester Credit Hours (Spanish 3; Fieldwork
Methodology 3; Area/Gender/Women's Studies 8)
Summer Session:  6 Semester Credit Hours (2Sp;  1Meth;  3A/G/WStd.)
Students may negotiate academic credit through their own university.


The Location
        Nestled high on the Pacific slope of the Tilaran Mountains in
Northwestern Costa Rica and surrounded by the tropical cloud forests of the
Bosque Eterno de los Ni=F1os and the Monteverde Reserve, the Instituto
Monteverde (IMV) is a non-profit educational association specializing in
socio-cultural and natural history immersion.  The IMV was initiated in
1986 by the people of Monteverde to administer cultural, scientific, and
educational programs and to share Monteverde's natural beauty and
biological richness with the rest of the world.  Our students are given the
opportunity to interact with local communities through homestays and field
research, and to evaluate the intricacies of balancing conservation and
development.  The IMV is a community leader in providing technical and
financial support to women's cooperatives, schools, and local programs
benefiting education and the arts.  The Institute also operates a Vida
=46amiliar (Family Life) Program designed to support local families in the
areas of integral health, prevention of domestic violence, and youth
development.
        We know little of the original indigenous Maleku population in this
region.  The area was first settled by Costa Rican subsistence farmers
during the 1920's and 1930's.  In 1951 a group of North American Quakers
came to Monteverde in search of a peaceful rural life, having chosen Costa
Rica because of its earlier abolition of the army.  The region now includes
three more densely populated neighboring communities (Santa Elena, Cerro
Plano, Monteverde) and about fifteen outlying villages that economically
depend upon the center.  The communities are enriched by their
multicultural character that is enhanced by scientists, artists, and
visitors who come to study or enjoy the natural splendor of the area.
Nowadays, local people live by coffee cultivation, dairy farming and work
in the cheese factory, arts and crafts, tourism, and participation in
grassroots organizations.


The Academic Program
        The courses are part of a 10-year project to create a data bank
that recuperates and collects the experiences of women in the development
of Costa Rica's Monte Verde region.  The 70 years since the initial
settlement in the region have brought profound changes to women's lives
that are illustrating the overall change that globalization has been
causing and continues to provoke.  Students will be immersed in this social
setting and, through their homestays and fieldwork, will observe and
collect women's experiences through oral history--some already written down
by the women themselves--considering the diverse agricultural,
technological (transportation, production, communications, household
equipment), political, economic, social, cultural, and psychological
aspects of this change.  Through their research, they will serve the
region's communities by documenting women's experiences in all these areas.
Over time, this documentation will take the form of women's life stories
for adults, school books for children, bi-lingual plays illustrating
conflictive issues in women's lives at different points in time, and of
contributions to the local historical collection.  The focus on women does
not mean that students will ignore men's experiences, as men's
recollections often provide additional insight into women's lives and the
development process.


Course Description
        Students will acquire theoretical knowledge on the above-mentioned
aspects of rural development in Costa Rica, assessed within the current
debate of what constitutes "development," and within the on-going
exploration of changes in gender roles.  They will participate in the
process as observers, recorders, and collectors, and with their insights
will also share in shaping future course format.  In addition to witnessing
women's experiences, students will develop an understanding of a culture
that is undergoing profound change under the impact of globalization.
        In turn, community members, women in particular, will benefit from
the students' interest and respect for their experiences and, more
tangibly, from the planned documentation suggested above.


Course Themes

The Debate about the Nature of Development
   * Changes in the context of development and of women's role in it,
        particularly with regard to gender analysis within rural development=

bonjour,

There are many sites devoted to Ulrike Ottinger on the World Wide Web, and
many include links to other sites where you can get the information you are
looking for.

One good place to start is PopcornQ, which lists distributor information,
including web addresses, for several Ottinger films.

An excellent critique of paradigms involving male/female differences in
communication can be found in a new book by Mary Crawford called "Talking
difference" published by London Sage in 1996.  She discusses Tannen's work
extensively and, by extension, the simplification of that work by writers
such as Gray.  I recommend the book highly for people in a variety of fields.
It is also simple and short enough to be used as a supplementary text in
various courses on women.  Rhoda Unger

    "Kiss Me Kate" is going to be staged here next month, and I'd
like to ask the list if they know of (or are themselves one) scholars
who address feminist issues in musical comedy.
    I usually just don't attend entertainments that involve hitting
and subduing ("A Funny Thing Happened . ." wasn't the least bit funny),
but this is being put on by a friend and will include discussions
afterward.  This is also, then, a request for suggestions about how to
approach issues raised by the play when folks gather afterwards (outrage
and boycotting aren't options for me this time).

A student would like information on subscribing to this list which she
thinks stands for feminists against violence, or to other lists about
violence against women and battered women's shelter.
You may reply to me privately and I can forward the information to her.
Many thanks.

Sandra,

If I remember correctly, only a portion of Lerner and Loewe's musical
comedy  _Kiss Me, Kate_ is based on Shakespeare's _The Taming of the
Shrew,_ which has been staged with or without hitting, although other
kinds of abuse are written into the script (e.g., cursing, verbal abuse,
public  humiliation, food and sleep deprivation, among others).

Although the Shakespeare's script has been pretty much sanitized for use
in _Kiss Me, Kate_ and some of the most obnoxious material omitted, it
might  be worthwhile to discuss both plays in the light of the
questions raised by Linda Bamber about the relationship between Katherine
and Petruchio  in _Comic Women, Tragic Men: A Study of Gender and Genre in
Shakespeare_ (Stanford UP, l982); Germaine Greer in _The Female Eunuch_;
 and Coppelia Kahn, "_The Taming of the Shrew_: Shakespeare's Mirror of
Marriage" in _Modern Language Studies_5, (1975), p. 98.

Discussion of the social/economic context of Shakespeare's play, and of
what the selection (and omissions or change in emphasis) of portions of it
for the 20th century musical might suggest about continued interest in the
issues that intrigued Shakespeare's audience, might make for a lively
post-play conversation. It would be nice if you could assume the group's
familiarity with _The Taming of the Shrew_, but if not, well-written
program notes might supply enough info for a basis of comparison.

One thing most people forget about Shakespeare's play is that it was, like
the _Taming of the Shrew_ performed in _Kiss Me, Kate_, a play within a
play.  Shakespeare's version has two initial Induction scenes (not often
performed) in which Christopher Sly, a drunken tinker, is presented with
the play as a joke, part of an effort to make him believe he is really a
"gentleman," and also to delay his efforts to  sleep with his
make-believe wife, who is really a page pretending to be his spouse.

Just how one might interpret the relationship of the Induction to play
within in the play (_Taming of the Shrew_) is hard to determine, partly
because in some versions of the play, Shakespeare did not return to the
Induction at the end, but let Kate's final speech on the husband-wife
relationship in V.ii. stand as the "last word" of the play.  In the same
way, the relationship between the very long frame narrative in Lerner and
Loewe and the almost peripheral _Taming_ story (aside from the great
songs!) might be discussed. What is being valued, or is at least focused
on here?  The career of the singer in the frame story playing Kate in the
performance story? Her relationship to the men in
her own life? What kind of relationship? and so on. Is _Kiss Me, Kate_
really about _The Taming of the Shrew_ after all, or primarily about a
performance of it as a vehicle for furthering a singer's career? and so
on.

Sorry to be so long winded.  Shakespeare's _Shrew_ is one of my
all-time favorite plays to teach in a feminist classroom.  Hope this all
works out for you.

Students may negotiate academic credit through their own university.


The Location
        Nestled high on the Pacific slope of the Tilaran Mountains in
Northwestern Costa Rica and surrounded by the tropical cloud forests of the
Bosque Eterno de los Ni=F1os and the Monteverde Reserve, the Instituto
Monteverde (IMV) is a non-profit educational association specializing in
socio-cultural and natural history immersion.  The IMV was initiated in
1986 by the people of Monteverde to administer cultural, scientific, and
educational programs and to share Monteverde's natural beauty and
biological richness with the rest of the world.  Our students are given the
opportunity to interact with local communities through homestays and field
research, and to evaluate the intricacies of balancing conservation and
development.  The IMV is a community leader in providing technical and
financial support to women's cooperatives, schools, and local programs
benefiting education and the arts.  The Institute also operates a Vida
=46amiliar (Family Life) Program designed to support local families in the
areas of integral health, prevention of domestic violence, and youth
development.
        We know little of the original indigenous Maleku population in this
region.  The area was first settled by Costa Rican subsistence farmers
during the 1920's and 1930's.  In 1951 a group of North American Quakers
came to Monteverde in search of a peaceful rural life, having chosen Costa
Rica because of its earlier abolition of the army.  The region now includes
three more densely populated neighboring communities (Santa Elena, Cerro
Plano, Monteverde) and about fifteen outlying villages that economically
depend upon the center.  The communities are enriched by their
multicultural character that is enhanced by scientists, artists, and
visitors who come to study or enjoy the natural splendor of the area.
Nowadays, local people live by coffee cultivation, dairy farming and work
in the cheese factory, arts and crafts, tourism, and participation in
grassroots organizations.


The Academic Program
        The courses are part of a 10-year project to create a data bank
that recuperates and collects the experiences of women in the development
of Costa Rica's Monte Verde region.  The 70 years since the initial
settlement in the region have brought profound changes to women's lives
that are illustrating the overall change that globalization has been
causing and continues to provoke.  Students will be immersed in this social
setting and, through their homestays and fieldwork, will observe and
collect women's experiences through oral history--some already written down
by the women themselves--considering the diverse agricultural,
technological (transportation, production, communications, household
equipment), political, economic, social, cultural, and psychological
aspects of this change.  Through their research, they will serve the
region's communities by documenting women's experiences in all these areas.
Over time, this documentation will take the form of women's life stories
for adults, school books for children, bi-lingual plays illustrating
conflictive issues in women's lives at different points in time, and of
contributions to the local historical collection.  The focus on women does
not mean that students will ignore men's experiences, as men's
recollections often provide additional insight into women's lives and the
development process.


Course Description
        Students will acquire theoretical knowledge on the above-mentioned
aspects of rural development in Costa Rica, assessed within the current
debate of what constitutes "development," and within the on-going
exploration of changes in gender roles.  They will participate in the
process as observers, recorders, and collectors, and with their insights
will also share in shaping future course format.  In addition to witnessing
women's experiences, students will develop an understanding of a culture
that is undergoing profound change under the impact of globalization.
        In turn, community members, women in particular, will benefit from
the students' interest and respect for their experiences and, more
tangibly, from the planned documentation suggested above.


Course Themes

The Debate about the Nature of Development
   * Changes in the context of development and of women's role in it,
        particularly with regard to gender analysis within rural development=

That post above illustrates Rhetoric 101:
Deny the facts; Accuse the person who has the temerity to say anything;
Make a sarcastic swipe at feminism.

Deconstruction 101:
Daphne's original post, in its entirety, the day after a request for
articles on Chicana feminism:

>>>Do people on this list really think it's a good form of teaching to
>>>have teachers "add" a book about an area they know nothing about, i

To know nothing about it means you can't have read it, am I right?  In
context as a reply to this thread, this is a swipe at the requestor, and
at the list in general as it is asked in a rhetorical way.  Also, since
the request was not for a book, but an article, it shows a subtle
re-defnition of the subject matter of the post.  The language used --
"really think" is typical of sarcastic usage.

>>>order to get the right racial/ethnic/etc. representation?  When I

You are putting words in Sharon's mouth.  She didn't mention the right
representation.  She said she was looking for a relevant supplement.

>>>consider the many years it's taken me to acquire competence in the
>>>area of Brazilian studies, the prospect of someone "diversifying"
>>>their teaching by a quick suggestion from an e-mail list makes me
>>>shudder.
This insult is so obvious I can't believe I have to point it out.  You
assume Sharon considers a quick post to the list the complete extent of
her committment to teaching diversity.  Also, the original post said the
request was for an undergraduate intro course.  You equate "competence"
with "years of study".  This is ageist.  In addition, the competence
required to use an article as a supplement in an undergrad introductory
course does not require years anyway.

>>>Good teaching requires a great deal more than this, I should
>>>think.
>>>======================
>>>Daphne.Patai@spanport.umass.edu

And once again, without knowing anything about her, you imply (plausible
deniability) that Sharon isn't a good teacher because she does the things
you assumed in the previous sentence.  If you wanted to speak in general
terms, you should start a separate thread, not play these games.  Nobody
said that good teaching consisted of taking quick responses from email to
add books with which one is not familiar.  What we see here is not a
reply to a post at all, but a rhetorical stragety designed to put list
members on the defensive by having to disprove the polemic you've assumed.

The reply (that Daphne said she didn't make), the day after Sharon's
original request, with the same subject line, makes it clear it *was* in
reply to the request for articles on Chicana feminism.  Daphne, if you
object, I think rather than insult Claire you need to look at how clear
(or not) your posts are.

There's a  pattern and rhetorical strategy that
you're using, and it doesn't contribute to clear communication on the
list.
I don't blame Jaime for saying "give it a rest".  Enough is enough, and
if we can't keep a level of debate that's somewhat civil and respectful,
or at least to the point, then what's the use?  The list becomes a wasted
resource.

I like the list; I like the people on the list; I think the list is
valuable, and I think Women's Studies is valuable.  I hate to see this
wonderful resource disrupted--and here's the pattern that keeps coming up.

List dynamics, chicana feminism thread:

1.  Simple request for article posted
2.  In response, concerns assuming the requestor isn't aware of
race/pedagogy issues
3.  Daphne's response, the day after the original request, reprinted in
its entirety above, assuming the requestor won't read the material, and
insulting her pedagogy.
4.  Objections (by me and others) to the validity of making these
assumptions; suggestions to be more accurate by re-labelling the subject
line if the conversation has indeed drifted from the original request
5.  Daphne replies to these requests denying the meaning of her reply;
says she's being personally attacked.
6.  New thread starts, defined by Daphne's "outrage".

This happens over and over and over and over and over.  Post.  Polemic
reply by Daphne.  Replies to re-defined conversation has words, but not
meaning, in common with original post.  Posts objecting to dynamic.
Daphne replies either "slander" or "I didn't say it".  Possible
variations: debate on silencing; flame wars; debate on p.c.ness.

 Daphne's use of email posts in past published work, out of context, in
order to make negative generalizations about Women's Studies *should* be
a red flag that this list *may* be being trolled for new material.   I
don't think it's fair to say that Claire has made a personal attack for
pointing this out.  To me, it feels like a power dynamic.  Normally, I
feel like everybody on the list is pretty supportive, and though we
challenge each other, it's because we care about issues deeply, not out
of grandstanding, hatefulness, or prejudice.

Because this dynamic is present, I feel afraid to post anything, fearing
it might appear out of context in Daphne's next book, and I feel that if
I point out the rhetorical and power dynamics present, Daphne will
threaten me (as she did earlier this year on the list) with the legal
charge of slander.  If there's anything wrong with women's studies it's
this! When I see these dynamics, my pesky conscience makes me post about
it.   Maybe I'm idealistic, but then again, that's why I'm on this list.

In conclusion, there are list dynamics present that make William's reply
that [paraphrased] --pedagogy is a valid point of discussion, and we
shouldn't tell Daphne to give it a rest-- worthy of deeper examination.
Of course the issue of pedagogy is important, and several people said so.
 The PROBLEM is the list dynamic, where we need to be kinder to ourselves
by being clearer in how we communicate.  For example, Daphne *could* have
said "the recent post requesting articles on Chicana feminism made me
wonder about how often Women's Studies professors find themselves having
to make last-minute syllabi additions.  Is there something about Women's
Studies that encourages our wanting to, or having to, do that?"  I think
THAT could have been a productive thread.

Instead, we get Daphne creating a misunderstanding and them complaining
with increasing nastiness that it's not her fault--and possibly (given
her past record) using the resulting posts in the future to argue about
how hopelessly divided Women's Studies is.  How free and productive can
list conversations be when this dynamic is present?

 So in conclusion--Daphne, hey Daphne--olive branch?  Be clearer with us
on the list, and then maybe you won't feel "attacked"; and if you choose
not to be clear and to the point then it will become obvious what you're
doing--trolling the list and looking for flamewars.


Cheers,

Chelsea

It might help to clarify that the title 'Women's Studies' of a program does
not denote or conote the exclusion of men as students any more than a title
such as  'Latin American Studies' or 'South Asian Studies' suggests that
students who weren't born in those areas or whose parents, etc. are not
welcome. Like those, Women's Studies is a scholarly field for intellectual
study, which can, adminstrators and students often want to be assured, lead
to professional specialization. Does experience as a woman count? Well,
does experience as a South Asian count in a South Asian Studies program?
Given the diversity of thought and practice to be studied, what's important
is the seriousness of intent in the courses.
    You're right, Betty, Gender Studies is something different from WS. I
often think it's too bad we didn't establish the precedent of 'Feminist
Studies' as the title.
    Hope this helps.    beatrice    bkachuck@cuny.campus.mci.net

    I'm replying publicly because the info I'm providing may be of
interest to many people looking for women- or gender-related lists.  I
maintain a frequently-updated, annotated listing of more than 300 such
email lists called Gender-Related Electronic Forums.  In addition to the
main listing, it contains 14 topical sub-sections to make it easier to
find lists in areas such as Activism, Arts & Humanities, Health,
Science & Technology, etc.  The overall URL is
http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/forums.html .  If you don't have access to the
web, you can get a version via e-mail by sending the message GET OTHER LISTS
to LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU .

    FAVNET is included in the main listing and in the Activism sub-
section.  Here's what the entry says:

FAVNET (Feminists Against Violence Network) is a women-run, moderated
list dedicated to ending domestic violence and violence against women
through networking and direct action in a feminist
environment. Counselors, legal advocates, survivors, feminists, and
profeminist women and men who seek to redress violence against women
are welcome. To subscribe, send the message SUBSCRIBE FAVNET <your
e-mail address> to MAJORDOMO@OTD.COM .

to your list you might add lee mun wah, a "diversity counsellor" who works
out of the l.a. area but does workshops of varying lengths, typically for
government organizations, schools, and corporations.  he was featured in
1995 on the "oprah" show, which served to boost his business wildly (his
company is called stir fry productions), and so you can book him or one of
his many counsellors.  typically he or his staff member shows one of his
films and then conducts a workshop asking participants to talk to each
other and to the group at large about their feelings regarding racism,
sexism, heterosexism, elitism, etc.  his first film, called "the color of
fear," is a tremendously moving work that documents a weekend-long
encounter session between men of diverse backgrounds.  last i heard, a film
specifically about women was in the works.

as folks have been suggesting -- yes, it was my experience that his visit,
which was very expensive for us, did not solve everything.  not even close.
but lee himself was a warm and very smart person, and it was a high-impact
experience no one there will forget.  used along with follow-up programs (i
would strongly encourage you to have these already in place -- we did not)
it could be a great start.

good luck,

I am not even sure why I am bothering posting this, but I am
growing increasingly frustrated with some of the comments that have
originated out of the Chicana Feminism discussion.
   The argument about the issue of the inclution of Chicana feminist
writing into WS introdutory course has degenerated into personal attacks
that remind me a great deal of another discussion that took place on this
list not even two month ago (I think it was regarding sexual harrasment).
It must be because the players are the same and the comments made are
extremelly reminicent.
   I find this typical of mainstream feminism to revolve around personal
attacks when an issue turns challenging. I do not want to attack or
support Daphne, Claire, Chasea or anybody else who had participated in
this discussion because I feel that everybody has lost the focus of the
original issue.
   When I responded to some of the commnets originally made in response
to the request for Chicana feminist literature  I did it because I thought
this was a
great opportunity to reflect on the content and pedagogy of WS in regards
to Chicanas and Latinas. I did not assume that the person making the
origibal request did not know anything about Chicana Issues, neither did
I support Daphne's response to the request because I felt both implied a
greater challenge in regards to Chicana and Latina Issues as well as, WS
in North America and its Eurocentric, colonial and imperial
implications.  The questions of whether or not Chicana Feminism should be
included within WS curricula, under what conditions should that inclution
take place and who would be better prepared to engage in this inclution
are still valid questions. Further, the fact that there are not enough
"full blown" Chicana and/or Latina accademics teaching in  WS even though
we have been recognized as a second mayority group in North America is
stiull an issue wothwhile to undertake.
   At this point I feel extremelly desillusioned because we have lost an
opprtunity to acquire a greater understanding of the complexities
surrouinding the issue of Chicana/Latina Stusies, "experiential" vs
"theoretical" feminist writing as well as, the complex interrelations of
gender, class and race that detrmine the uniqueness of the experince of
Latinas in a way that, as it became evident from some of the postings,
place us, Latinas,  at different sides in regards to issues concerning WS,
development, feminism, etc. Further, we have lost an opportunity to
reflect on the issue of WS teaching and pedagosy as well as on the
implications and complexities of teaching inclusivelly.
   I would like to call atention to this lost and to the fact that by
engaging in the kind of exchange that has been taking place many women of
color, not only Latinas, though I include myself, may feel silenced and
unable to bring our points of view into the discussion.

Well, yeah.

I think the turn of this whole, um, discussion, orbits around the question
of "expertise," the value of carefully vetted scholarly "authority," and
the importance of some "approved list" of readings in women's studies (or
any other field). A perceived lack of some combo of all three (i.e.,
"RIGOR") is what really concerns some people about WMST and other
interdisciplinary studies, fairly or not.  That's how I read Daphne's
remark re: "When I think of all the time I've spent becoming an expert on
Brazillian women, etc"  (paraphrase).

While getting/having "credit in the straight world" (to borrow a phrase
from a Hole song) that still sees women's studies as somehow illegit is a
real concern in what we'll just call "Academia Today,"  it's still
important for women's studies people to be evermindful of the border-y
nature of our project. We may not be "EXPERTS" on an article or topic the
first time we teach it, but making an honest and protracted effort to
widen the topical scope of our courses AND thereby widen the frame of
reference for making conceptual linkages is an important risk to take,
especially in women's studies, a site where we're supposed to (at least
the way I understand it) be upfront about the production and dissemination
of "knowledge" and "scholarship."

One of the hardest parts of this is avoiding the intellectual tourism
phemomenon of "This week, Chicana feminism -- next week, transsexual cat
fanciers..." (insert laugh here, you irony-impaired folks!) is a big
challege, and one which should be foregrounded in courses as a way of
pointing up how loathesomely hegemonic most curricula elsewhere in the
academy ARE. Think about how it always pisses you off when some fatcat guy
prof asks you for "an article or two that will allow me to include 'the
women's perspective' into my popular course on WWII diplomacy" and know
he'll use that "inclusion" to pat himself on the back in faculty meeting
or EVEN list himself as an "expert" on "WOmen's perspectives on WWII
diplomacy."


Of course one should not assign stuff w/o reading it first. I had a
self-styled "ALpha Academic Male REsearcher" music history prof once who,
in an act of what I will always regard as utter contempt for us grad
students in a pop musicology seminar, assigned a bunch of freakin' books
he'd never read but wanted to read "with us" ( A real love me, I'm "Mr.
Open" move)  b/c he suspected they (and the pickings of our active little
brains) might be valuable to him in his current "research" (and I use that
term lightly).  He did this with his undergrads, too. It was a disaster of
epic proportions and led to student revolt and nasty feelings on both
sides.


So, yeah. There are BAD IRRESPONSIBLE BAD BAD teachers out there.

On the other hand, I've had many good experiences reading brand spanking
new journal articles with/in classes inside and outside women's studies.
It just means that the "teacher" has to be open to "learning" naked in
front of her/his students.

OF *COURSE* IT's REALLY HOT TO EXPERIENCE (OR BE) A TEACHER PROFESSING
HER/HIS "THING," but even the most intoxicating rootbound houseplants get
yellow spots and DIE.

Just some rambly thoughts.

The CFP about the proposed book "MEN WHO ARE REALLY GOOD IN BED
                AND THE WOMEN WHO THINK THIS IS ENOUGH."
reminds me that I need urgently citations for this idea (which a male
editor is questioning about a soon-to-be-published paper of mine):
WOMEN SOMETIMES FAKE ORGASMS.
I've known this all my life and have talked with countless women about
this; I've seen it in books BUT a search for "faked orgasm" does not
result in any "hits" and even MEDLINE has only ONE article about this (a
recent German study) since 1985...
If this is not a private delusion, :-) please help me out. Thanks.

The recent messages about inclusion exclusion seclusion of Chicanas in
survey courses, like many others, involves both pedagogical and polemical
input. As someone who passes for mainstream but has forever been Others
(several) I try to be aware of such sensitivity and be honest in
constructing a syllabus. However, in any survey course on, say (what I
teach) World Literature by Women, one cannot do justice to all women
everywhere throughout herstory/history.
So it would be interesting perhaps to discuss criteria for bringing
cohesion to survey courses without getting into the "add XYZ and stir"
model.

I'm sorry to perhaps beat a dead horse here but perhaps reacting to
issues of minor importance to a pragmatic posting is important in
bringing up related issues of interest to all? Could we perhaps take the
personal "assumed" perspective out of these kinds of responses and try to
consider the issues generally?  I think many people have mentioned useful
things about feminism, pedagogy, cultural perspectives, inclusiveness etc.

It seems to me they're relevant unless we just encourage bantering
between a few people about misunderstanding and miscommunication?

Amen. I don't know Daphne and don't always agree with her perspectives
(whether in books, editorials in the Chronicle of Higher Education, or
messages on WMST-L). I do appreciate, however, her "listening to a
different drummer" voice. Her observations may be critical, but I find
them legitimate and worthy of discussion. As Ellen Gil-Gomez and a few
others note, for example, such issues as pedagogy and the ease (or
difficulty) of including myriad cultural perspectives in a WS or
WS-related course are important and ongoing (at least for me and I've been
teaching for almost 30 years).

In a similar vein, I was interested in the comments by the subscriber who
felt that much of the Chicana/Latina research is embryonic (experiential
and anecdotal rather than "empirical"). I agreed but didn't see the
comment, unlike some subscribers, as negative. Instead, I thought it was a
useful observation that might generate some grant-writing and (especially
quantitative) research. Like it or not, policy makers rarely pay attention
to qualitative research (except when conducted and disseminated by a
handful of PRIVILEGED male scholars--white, black, and Latino).

During the 3-4 years I've subscribed to WMST-L, there have been a number
of overt and implied "attacks" of perspectives, theories, pedagogical
approaches, and sundry messages. Usually, and especially if the attacks
seem to represent the majority of WMST-L opinions (expressed or assumed),
either the personal assaults were ignored by the targets or
someone on the list rephrased the volley and converted it to a larger
issue. It seems to me that the same should be done with Daphne's
messages--ignore what you think is personal but consider the larger
issues. Same with other seeming "contrarians" who might raise unpopular
but thoughtful, at least imho, questions.

Deborah:

You have probably thought already about *Listen Up: Voices of the Next
Generation* ed Barbara Findlen, and *To Be Real* ed. Rebecca Walker.  Lisa
Hogeland also had an article in Ms. a few years ago called "Fear of
Feminism" which speculated on the reasons that many young women are
disinclined to identify w/feminism.  Our local artsy paper *The Providence
Phoenix* had a recent article called "Lipstick Liberation" which poked holes

So many scholars, and all of us so wrong about so much .......

    Why are we wasting our time trying to have a reasoned conversation with an
ideologue?  This is exactly what Daphne wants - our time, our energy, our
engagement.

    I don't believe in censorship.  She has a right to her opinions.  Please,
she's got a HUGE forum for them; I don't want to cede this one.

    I suggest that we simply withdraw our energy; refuse to take the next bit
of rhetorical bait.  I, for one, have made a decision to delete any posting
that comes up on my list from her.  And I will also delete any discussion
that becomes a thread off of her posts.

I think some people are also smarter to see through a scapegoating
mechanism.  I read several smart articulate posts to this list
on the multifacted issues this embroilment has generated (with
Daphne being right "here"). It didn't stop any of them. It seems to me
smart articulate people  have no trouble articulating their ideas if they
want to on this list. That's one of the wonderful yields of the
combination smart + articulate. "Blame it on Daphne" is a shoddy request
at best.

So when other people do it it's "shoddy, flawed, and self-serving",
when fellow historians do it it's "mistakes, biases,  and naivete".
If that isn't a self-serving framing, I don't know what is.

It just has occurred to some of us that contributions (and certainly
that includes great contributions) can  include serious flaws as well.
Unless you are working from an infantile mind frame that can
only see reality in terms of dichotonies: black or white, good or evil,
perfect scholarship or trash, etc., these framings of
the stated of disciplines are quite shoddy
and self-serving. Great progress has been made, credit deserves to
be given, many halleluiahs, but denial about existing serious problems is
very shoddy and deserves to be criticized always.

It also occurs to me that the only reason Daphne gets
a response is because she is in a privileged position
to bring wider attention to these criticisms. Otherwise
they would be totally ignored by the very self-serving
and self-glorifying participants.  Exactly like when one
tries to bring about criticism to "men" in positions
of power, it is only *not* ignored if you can put it in
the spotlight.  Also, anyone who has done a good job
in studying history knows that progress in academia
and society doesn't come about by having tea-time pleasantry
conversations with people who need to be accountable
for their problematic actions.

In a message dated 97-09-12 07:53:57 EDT, you write:

<<  My work grew out of my own lived experience,
 attendance at workshops on the topic, courses, reading, and personal
 reflection.  Today, because I have a strong academic background, I know
 to cite research that informs my work.  However, that does not diminish
 the earlier work.

 So, my question is how do scholars decide "whose voice counts"?, when one
 can decide that only those who cite other experts have appropriate
 "credentials"?  My own experience is that the voice of those in less
 academic settings are often doing the ground-work, making the
 connections, that researchers only come to much later.  That has surely
 been the case in peace education. and most likely in the field of women's
 studies, itself.   >>


I have been looking forward to reading responses to Jacqueline's questions in
this post.  I think the discussion going on about Chicana perspectives,
inclusion, materials for teaching, etc. and this post raise many of the same
important questions/points/issues.  Perhaps if we set ourselves the task of
responding to Jacqueline's important questions, we get continue to address
the issues raised in the Chicana thread but without the personal vitriol that
has become attached to it.

Anyway, the whole issue of credentials is an important one for all of us.  I
know, for instance, that many job posts in women's studies include the job
requirement of a degree in women's studies.  Only a few of those posts say
"or equivalent experience."  So where does that leave the pioneers in the
field of academic women's studies who don't have degrees in women's studies
because they invented those degrees?  And where does that leave the pioneers
in feminism who don't have degrees, academic so-called professional
credentials because they found the heteropatriarchal academic institutions
too stiffling and took their revolutionary zeal elsewhere--and have at least
as muc to teach about feminist, women's studies, contemporary women's
history, literature, etc. as anyone with a degree in the field?

And how many people of color are excluded from teaching about, say, Black
history or racism or Chicana lit. or other subjects because they don't have
the credentials BECUUSE of racism?  What happens to the creators of knowledge
when the knowledge they have created becomes institutionalized and the only
way to be part of the institution is to have the institutional credentials?

This is a very crazy scenario.  I think that women's studies people, the
various ethnic and racial studies people, have to be the ones to figure out
what justice means in these situations and do something to implement it by
challenging and offering other ways to handle these realities to the
institutions that are so limited in what they can make available to students
by the institutions' own rules.

Though this work, too, focuses on the source text rather than _Kiss Me,
Kate_ per se, Penny Gay's book _As She Likes It_ devotes an entire chapter
to _The Taming of the Shrew_ in performance from a feminist critical
perspective.  Not only is he commentary useful and insightful, but the
synopses of performances that she provides is as well.

I had the opportunity last fall to see an all-female production of _Taming
of the Shrew_ at Footsteps Theatre in Chicago.  What was interesting to me
about that play was the fact that they went out of their way to leave the
violence IN.  With an all-female cast, what this threw into sharp relief
was the intense CLASS conflict that provides a strong undercurrent to the
surface narrative of the text.  Very interesting stuff.

Teresa, I hope you don't give up. Niki, the term "embyonic" does
imply that the "experiential" (aka "touchy-feely") is infantile,
primitive, something to be outgrown on the
path to maturity, which you equate with empiricism. Other people
might equate the intellectual maturity of a field like Chicana Studies
with precision, critical distance or theoretical sophistication
(Rosa, was that your position?--unfortunately I deleted your first post by
mistake--if you still have it, could you forward it to me?). Still others
might object to the idea that the "experiential" must be "outgrown"
because they equate intellectual maturity with activism or the nurturing
and passing on of a powerful "experientially-based"  political
consciousness to the next generation. (Teresa, was that more or less your
position?)   All of these kinds of "maturity" are interrelated and
complementary--no need to put ourselves or each other down (except that we
live in a hierarchical society that loves us to put ourselves and each
other down).

Personally, I'll always have a place for the experiential, and I
wouldn't call it "less developed" than more conventionally academic
work. (In fact, This Bridge Called My Back was exciting to me because
it embodies a kind of "theory in the flesh," lived theory.) But I'd be
interested to hear more from list members about what the
"maturation" of a discipline like Chicana studies might/should be, and
why.

Anyone interested in the literary side of this debate (the "maturation" of
an academic discipline *that is the scholarly wing of a living liberation
movement of an oppressed group*) might be interested in a debate
beteen Joyce Joyce, Henry Lewis Gates and Houston Baker about formalist
criticism (poststructuralism) and the future of African American literary
studies (New Literary History, 18 and 19, 1987). Joyce echos the position
taken by Barbara Christian in "The Race for Theory." Sometimes
the question come down to mixed allegiences: allegience to one's community
or political base vs allegience to the intellectually flawed, sometimes
co-opted BUT useful and sometimes admirable liberal truth-seeking
procedures of the university. (It's important to point out that much
feminist/multicultural "disloyalty" to the university exists NOT because
we don't care about scholarship but because the university fails in
systematic ways to live up to its truth-seeking mission.)

Summing up the Joyce-Gates-Baker debate, Harold Fromm writes: "This
ongoing debate derives most of its interest not from the rightness or
wrongness of its principals' positions so much as from its exhibition of
an evolving, conflicted consciousness...Though Professor Joyce's love and
loyalty with regard to her people can only command respect, and though her
conscience as a professor can only be admired, her conflicted roles as
black and as intellectual involve a psychic split that can never be healed
without an alteration of perspective and a transvaluation of values."

Isn't it interesting how Fromm believes it is a contradiction in terms to
be black-identified and an intellectual! Clearly it is his perspective
and values that need to be altered and transvalued.

He goes on: "This is, however, a very common dilemma, experienced by
everyone who has grown away from his family because of rejection of
ethnicity, change of social class, or increased education" (Fromm is
thinking here specifically of Richard Rodriguez.)

Fromm apparently believes there is a necessary connection between
education and "whiteness" and I think this is something that all
ethnic studies programs might need to combat. Based on this quote, I have
a bunch of questions:

1. Is it one mission of Chicana theory to demonstrate that increased
education and/or change of social class do NOT have to lead to rejection
of ethnicity or an intellectual psychic split? (I get this impression
sometimes from reading Gloria Anzaldua.)

2. The issues surrounding assimilation are important for the study of all
minorities. Should WS teachers stress the ways in which the assimilation
stresses are unique for each group or should we try to generalize?

3. Is it one mission of Chicana theory to effect an "alteration of
perspective and transvaluation of values" not in the mind of the
individual Chicana woman but in the collective mind of the American
society that needs her to be fragmented?

These are just intended as thoughts to get a discussion going...a
discussion that is definately not going on at my academic intsitution...
If anyone else out there read the Joyce Joyce debate in NLH, I'd also be
interested in more on- or off- line discussion of that.

A colleague not on this list is looking for information on when the
practice of referring to men by their surnames and to women by their first
names changed to using surnames for both genders. She remembers it
occuring sometime in the 1980s, but we haven't been able to verify this.
Does anyone know or have a citation?

Thanks in advance.

Our campus film series will show ' In the Company of men" and I plan to ask
my Soc of Gender Roles class, a good mix of men and women, to see the movie
and analyze it for changing gender roles. I have not seen the movie yet.
Any word of advise, warning, suggestion, etc?

The comment below about surnames seems to be at variance with my own
experience.  When I was in high school all students were addressed by their
first names and so addressed each other.  In college and at the
university, students addressed each other by their first names whether male
or female and faculty addressed students as Mr or Miss.  In the seventies
with the advent of the Ms convention some of us used only surnames for
males and females when calling the role.  In calling on students I
generally used and continue to use both names-Barbara Smythe or Tom Jones.
In some settings surnames alone have been used alone for a long
time--Jones, report to the Captain--Blanchard was and excellent golfer at
school.  Those settings were all male, but I heard in the fifties young
women at all female schools use the same convention in speaking of and
addressing other young women to whom they were not close.  In some
settings the use of a surname alone in addressing someone has been an
indication of class or authority as when a superior, say executive
officer, might call junior executives by their surname but be addressed by
them as Mr. Interestingly, he might address the night watchman by his
first name.  I would like to know about the settings in which men were
called by their surnames and women by their given names [assuming the men
and women had comparable roles] since I am not aware of ever having been
in one.

At first I was curious about this as well, but then it occured to me that I
have seen the difference *in writing*.  Men were referred to by surname
after the initial use of full name.  Women, however, were referred to by
first name after the first reference (or sometimes Miss Jones was used).
We all know where that led . . .

This must have been the case because I have students in my writing classes
who STILL refer to all men by surname and all women by first name.  It's a
bit jarring to come across: "Rodriguez writes about his experiences in
college in a different way than Joyce [Carol Oates]."

Rachel and her colleague may want to look at style manuals (MLA, APA,
Chicago) and when this heading "Sexist Language" first came to be
discussed.  I checked out our Guide to Freshman Writing, but they just say
"during the past 30 years . . ."

The "theory" of IQ tests and tests and mental ability tests that refer to
it, showing that they produce the same bell-shaped distribution of scores
(school reading tests, SAT, etc.), is that the test/s represent inherent
differences. This permits psychologists, educators and so on to tell the
world that there's a biological boundary that cannot be overcome by social
intervention. The "Black IQ Test" is a useful exercise to demonstrate that
social experience affects IQ test scores. But it doesn't, by itself, get at
the pernicious theory.

For the NWSA conference 6/10-14/98 embedded conference "Women's Rights
ARound the World: Past, Present, and Future" I am organizing a panel on
mediators of women's rights. Papers would address institutions that grant
or withhold rights, sources from which rights are assumed to be derived
(e.g., local custom, a divinity), the problematic of rights in legal
theories, or something else that seems relevant to the mediation of rights.
Papers should include evaluations of the possibility of achieving
improvements in material aspects of women's lives from the perspective of
the mediator discussed, as a guide to activism.
    My paper will focus on the state, mostly in respect to the US, India and a
few other postcolonized countries.
    If you are interested in participating in the panel, please let me know.
The deadline for submissions to NWSA is 11/1/97.

i have been following the discussion on the listserv about quoting people's

This interested me enough to do a little research.  i recommend everyone who
likewise finds this practice has drawn their attention to consult a web site
by a lawyer, Ivan Hoffman, who i believe specializes in publishing and
literary law.  He has posted a number of articles on the subject.  The
relevant one is called '"C" RIGHTS IN "E" MAIL.  his address is
http://home.earthlink.net/ivanlove/rights.html.  This is a discussion of how
copyright applies to email postings and how and why permission must be
sought if such email is quoted.
Not being a lawyer, i am not going to paraphase his discussion, but rather
recommend you consult him for your own protection if you have any interest
in protecting your email. Attaching a copyright slug is not necessary and
has no legal meaning in this context.  The copyright is automatic.

hello!

Several people have asked me for the citation for the "Black IQ Test." I
have not been able to get a copy of the BITCH (Black Intelligence Test to
Counterbalance Honkies, sometimes also called the Black Intelligence Test of
Cultural Homogeneity), but I have learned that it was developed by Robert L.
Williams and presented at the 1972 APA meeting in Hawaii.

I have, however, found the Dove test, upon which the BITCH test may have
been based. Here is the citation:
"The Dove Counterbalance Intelligence
Test," and the citation is Haskins, Jim. The Psychology of Black Language_.
New York: Barnes and Noble Books, 1980, pp. 47-50.

Thanks so much to all of you who helped with this question!

Beatrice,  30 yrs ago, I devised a simple fifty word vocabulary test for a
college course, and asked students to define the terms.  Included were
words like  "bread",  "rag",  and others that had multiple meanings,
depending upon one's racial/cultural/etc. experience.    This was useful
not only to  "demonstrate that social experience affects test scores", but
also to   raise consciousness and (hopefully) examine and change
attitudes.  It seems that this is what is most needed in order to " get at
pernicious theory" that supports racist or other-wise biased
interpretations of IQ or ohter testing results.

Subject: Re: credentials & research

Hi SUsan, I appreciate your efforts to raise up this question.  Just
today, I had a conversation about the use of a reference in a scholarly
paper, and that reference was rejected because it, itself, was not
"scholarly".  No matter that it was the first book in the entire field,
when there was not yet -- and still isn't -- an academic field.

I feel stymied, because the book in question, and others like it, was
written for parents (not academics, though some academics who are
parents appreciated it), and it has also been used for
classroom teaching.  Another thing about this particular book, is that
when it was written, the publisher explicityly requested that it be
written for adults with 6th grade reading level -- considered at the time
as norm in US. While that is a sad commentary on US literacy rates, it
does make the book accessible to a wider reading audience.

So, the question for me is both what is considered "scholarly research",
and by whom?, and what format must it be in to be considered such?

Perhaps this is the issue one person had in mind when asking about the
validity of her own work  (I am not remembering all of the post, but the
message mentioned  "hurt feelings" over an earlier message re Chicana
feminism.)  Sorry this is not clearer!

I think your questions about the ways that racism, sexism, ageism limit
whose voice makes it to the academy are important ones.

Subject:      1)Chicana feminism  2) Listening to each other  3) Daphne

I would like to point out, since several have made points about listening
to each other, that I wrote that many of the Chicana writers who
are used in classes are wonderful. It was the first thing I said in my
post.  Saying that the field of Chicana/Latina studies is in its infancy
is no more an insult than saying that my daughter (who is 17) is a teenager.
It is simply a fact of life. Only Minerva sprang forth full-grown from
the head of Zeus. The rest of us have to go through stages.

For me, as a historian, academic rigor has a precise meaning: It means
that we do deep research and try to compose as clear a picture as we can
given the limitations of working primarily from documents. It also means
that we ask questions about the documents: Whose document? where did it come
from? under what conditions was it produced? how was it preserved? is it
authentic? And if we have the answers to all of those questions, we look
at it in the context of history that has already been recorded, and consider
the theories about history in that particular time. We come to the study with
our own biases (EVERYBODY has biases) and usually a structure by which we
understand the world.  In other words, Karl Marx understands the world which
emphasizes materialism. bell hooks understands in a different way that empha-
sizes the relationships of race and gender.

Many of the writers who are used in Chicano studies classes are at the
level of recording their own experiences and giving their particular
understanding of why things are the way they are.

I understand that young people have to have a sense of identity and that
we are helping them to attain that.  But I am also teaching them a method
for analyzing the world, and in particular, the past. If they cannot move
beyond the discovery of identity, I believe that they are as handicapped as
if we sent our children out into the world without an understanding of
themselves as part of our society, not only part of the community.

I have refrained from telling you why I feel so strongly about this, but
now, I will. I started grad school with the primary purpose of serving
my community, i.e., working with Latino students to increase retention,
and generally to raise the level of education in the Latino communities
around the country (realizing, of course, that I would not being doing it
alone). The summer after my first year of grad school, I was picked to be one
of the TA's for a women's studies course to be taught as part of the
freshman summer program. The FSP was a specially enriched set of classes
taught with a strong intensive writing component.  The prof for my particular
class was a white woman, very progressive, who had a strong identity with the
Black students (this is rather a long, complicated story, so I will not
go into it.)  Anyway, I was the only Latina, and there were 5 black grad
student TA's and two whites.  The two whites were a couple, married to
each other. The FSA was very focussed on identity politics, and had forums
for the kids every night on all sorts of oppression. I can't tell you how un-
comfortable I was, not only for the sense that it was brain-washing people
with an identity of victimhood, but because it was very polarizing. When
the two white students (liberals & both very nice people) assigned the
film "Do the Right Thing" (the Spike Lee film came out during that summer),
the prof called a meeting and there was a very nasty discussion about whether
the two white students had the right, since they were white, to make such an
assignment.  The two of them did it innocently, thinking that since there
were so many black kids in the program, they would LIKE to have something
relevant to their lives to write about.  After that, the prof and the black
TAs stopped associating with the whites, and when I sat with the couple at
lunch, they stopped associating with me as well. This was 1989. It was the most
painful experience of my grad school life. Worse, because of the polarization
in the program, I could never again get a job with FSA or with the AAA
(Academic Advancement Program) despite stellar teaching ratings.
I will NEVER forgive the professor, who should have known better, from
allowing that polarization. She could have channeled the difficulties into
an learning opportunity for everyone. Instead, she allowed  identity
politics to control the situation. The students, thankfully, were unaware
of the tensions, but the experience for the grad students, who should have
been beyond the level of discovering identity, was a sour one.

What we teach in the classroom, and what we do with it, has an enormous
impact on people's lives. If we hope to have a society where people truly
get along, then we need not only to discover identity, but also to move
beyond to the next levels. We must rise above passion to understanding
and acceptance.


2)  Daphne and I seldom agree. We have different beliefs about many things
and different ways of expressing ourselves, but I have deep respect for
her, even though we differ    on many issues, including women's studies.
She is a fine scholar who has consciously and conscientiously stretched herself
from doing Brazilian literature (not the culture she was raised in)
to where she is now teaching a course on slavery in Brazil for which she
has done an enormous amount of thinking and study.  You may not agree with
her but to demonize her is simply wrong.   We have a professional friendship
that has evolved into a personal friendship and I am proud to call her
my friend.

2)   Listening to each other: This is an informal forum. People read questions
and comments and all sorts of interesting trains of thought--often
completely unrelated to the original--result.  To excoriate people for not
sticking to the original topic is incomprehensible to someone who has
been on this list for 6 or 7 years, as I have been.

have been singled out for not publishing scholarly work because our journals
were not on the approved list of many disciplinary departments.  One case
that I know particularly well involved someone who had published widely in
such venues as Sinister Wisdom, Lesbian Ethics, etc. and was turned down by
her department because her writings were only for a narrow audience--in her
case the unusual happened and a Dean overturned the department saying that he
thought that all academic writing was for a narrow audience  :)

I also remember in the very first women's studies course I was involved in as
a graduate student (and yes this was a first at my university)--that the
graduate students had to go to fight with some of the more established
faculty about what constituted feminist research.  We had one student that
wanted to do community activist work that was rejected by the faculty, a
decision that we were able to overturn.

In any case I applaud Susan and Jacqueline for getting us to think again
about what is feminist research and who are women's studies scholars.

I forget which German intellectual said that the university
has replaced the Church in the modern era as the main inculcation
institution.  What is considered scholarly research is what will
serve to maintain an elite in academia as the sole possessors of
knowledge, similar to the control clergy had always imposed
on knowlege for the maintenance of their power/status. Actually I
have not seen much evidence that  Women's Studies is in any way an
improvement in this  respect as other fields.

Russell Jacoby has an interesting article "The decline of
American Intellectuals" in which he reflects about the shift
of writers and intellectuals in the 1st half of hte century
and their incorporation in academia in the second. "Joining
institutions, they ceased to be marginal, bohemian, or
independent.  Eventually -- not immediately-- their thinking
and concerns reflected their new situations, usually academic
communities. As professors, academics no longer wrote for
a larger public, but devoted themselves to colleagues and
professionals. ... Professionalized, they also became
privatized."  This obviously is also reflected in the
language used and the war for academic publication as one
of the sole measures of competence/"knowledge".

Although he is generalizing and he doesn't address if the same happened
to feminist intellectuals in the last 30 years,
this shift has had
profound implications for the legitimization of certain
types of knowledge/experience versus others.

I was particularly disgusted in academia about the cultivation
of an arrogant mindset regarding who possesses knowledge.
Generalizing, of course, I noticed
an intense shift from the undergraduate population to the graduate
one and then to faculty. But it is already very apparent
at the grad student level.

there was this paternalistic (no less pervasive in womens studies)
"we can't be wrong, you're just too inferior to know who
possesses knowledge in the world". I remember women/feminist grad students
talking about their research subjects in a way that that is very
similar to how pimps talk about the women they exploit,
an arrogance to use people as they wish, because "they were
the researchers, they knew more than everyone else,  they had a thesis to
do". I remember mostly being surrounded by people who were extremely
privileged and who hollered day and night about the ways they were
oppressed  but who were so comfortable with all kinds of inequality and
violence they profited from. But most of all,
I remember the profound arrogance from people who were so flawed.
I imagine medieval clergy to be exactly like that.

One of the many contradictions in academia
is the  professors who teach
"radical" things, but who  usually do it within a reactionary/elitist
structure/process. What, in the end, are they teaching? Resistance is
futile, you will be assimilated? :)

I gained a lot in academia even though I was in
institutions which were by the privileged, of the privileged,
and for the privileged and that included some very
privileged women studies folks. I wish I had had
teachers who were less hypocritical and ignorant in that respect, that
were more aware of how the privileges they had/have
limits their own knowledge and awareness, but it's so very
rare to find people like that in academia/womens studies.
It makes you think either they don't make it or they don't
want to be in such an environment where there is such an attitude
problem.

So that's  some of my "non-scholarly," of course, but very real
experience.

Susan Koppleman mentions, "I know, for instance, that many job posts in
women's studies mention the requirement of a degree in women's studies."
As a student obtaining a PhD in women's studies, this gives me hope, if
it is true.  What constitutes many?  The majority?  Since when?  Are
these master's degrees, undergraduate degrees?  How are those of you
involved in WS hirings weighting the above-mentioned requirement?  Susan
also mention that the issue of credentials and research excludes a number
of pioneers.  I want to put in my .02 for another group that is
pioneering, though they/we may be conflated into other groups: graduates
with PhDs in women's studies.  Awarding such degrees is a relatively
recent phenomenon, or at least not a widespread one, is it not?  That
is to say there is no glut of such degreed persons.  The majority of
professors in WS programs have obtained degrees in other disciplines.
Would someone advise whether it continues to be the case that many, if
not most, hold their primary appointments in English, History, Soc.,
Pol.Sci., etc.  My understanding of the second most frequent scenario is
that of joint appointments.  As most folk, until relatively recently
would have been unable to obtain PhDs in traditional disciplines without
either a)already having a masters in the field, or b) doing masters work
as a part of the PhD process, where is this pool of WS PhDs?  Not only is
this a self-interest question, it also relates to a thread from last
academic year re: whether an advisor would recommend her student even
*consider* the PhD in WS.  Thoughts? Clarifications? Data?  Thanks.

high in these societies. Do you know what subincision is, and whether it
involves removal of parts of the vulva or simply frees the clitoris from
its hood? I would be grateful if you can shed any light on this.

This is a question close to my heart also, as an "uncredentialed"
researcher who has been toiling in the fields of independent (i.e.
unaffiliated) scholarship for nearly 30 years. It's no easy task. In the
early 80s, I found it difficult to break into (that is, present my work
within) the academic world of Women's Studies, where I was essentially a
nobody.

With hard work and persistence, I have been able to present my slide talks
at scores of colleges and universities, but the majority have been
sponsored by campus women's centers, not by the WS depts.  The response has
always been positive and enthusiastic. (More often than not my hosts
express surprise that I don't have a doctorate. Actually, I don't even have
a BA.) I feel compelled to point this out because there seems to be an
assumption that independents are not grounded in solid research and are all
out on some wacky fringe.

I know that WS scholars are themselves being accused of being less than
"rigorous,"  and sense a defensive reflex, a fear of being attacked by the
conservatives, which is realistic and understandable. (Why take a risk on
an unknown who might bring disgrace on us?) It's just that I'm really
wondering if WS has become a closed system (for professionals only). I will
always warmly remember the sisters at Northwestern University women's
center, who supported my work by inviting me back six or seven times.

I'm aware of the seige WS is under, and the funding cutbacks. But as hard
as conditions may be within academia, I can't underscore enough the
difficulty of carving out a path as a historian outside the academy,
without salary or grant funding. (In my own case, I work at a typically
female job, as caregiver to an elder, to make ends meet while maintaining a
somewhat flexible schedule for presentations.) Attending conferences is
unthinkable on my budget. So I've been pretty much off the radar screen.
But watch for the Suppressed Histories web site: it should be up in late
fall, and I'll announce the URL on this list.

Thanks to Jacqueline Haessly and Susan Koppelman for their astute remarks
calling attention to this issue and for a broader, more inclusive spectrum
for WS. By the way, I also think that Teresa Macias makes some excellent
points:

<The questions of whether or not Chicana Feminism should be
<included within WS curricula, under what conditions should that inclution
<take place and who would be better prepared to engage in this inclution
<are still valid questions. Further, the fact that there are not enough
<"full blown" Chicana and/or Latina academics teaching in  WS even though
<we have been recognized as a second mayority group in North America is
<still an issue wothwhile to undertake.

One idea: some proactive grant-writing to support a greater presence of
Chicana mujeristas teaching and presenting on campus. Not necessarily
academics either (not to down Chicana scholars, of course).  Women like
Elizabeth Martinez, who writes for Z magazine, have *a lot* to teach, a lot
of experience as well as knowledge and analysis. I bet she'd be a dynamite
speaker too.

Subject:      Cafe' WMST-L

When I was an undergraduate, I used to hang out at the cafes in Berkeley
and San Francisco. They were wonderful places with great coffee, wonderful
desserts, and yes, endless cigarettes. Each had its own rhythm: Some were did a
brisk business, and others had a slower more contemplative place.  We
met professors and students, non-students/professors with no visible
means of support who just sat all day reading or writing, drinking endless cups
of coffee. I remember the Cafe Trieste in North Beach   in San Francisco
circa 1968: some came to argue, and others to listen; some just came to drink
in the atmosphere.  With the pace of my work, I can't remember the last time
I could just hang out in a cafe. Nowadays, I run in on my way to class, or drag
in at the end of a long day. (More often, I just make coffee in my office, in-
spite of advice  from my doctor that cutting coffee would stop my hot flashes.)
Nowadays the cafes are smokeless (thank God), and the coffee, sadly, is not as
good.

For me, WMST-L serves a kind of cybercafe function--the Cafe at the end
of the Universe?  I keep in touch with people I know in the biz, some have
strong opinions, some offer tentative ones.  Some find something to object to
at every turn; others never speak up in public but murmur their comments
just out of earshot of the group. What we say here doesn't threaten the
future of women's studies anymore than the arguments in the cafes of my
youth threatened anything. But it does provide stimulation that we might
not find anywhere else.  I know that I tune into WMST-L every day while
the members of our women's studies program only meet once a month.
The opinions expressed here should be food for thought--or should I say,
cappuchinos for thought?  If people say provocative things, can we
accept it as characteristic of one of the  personalities of our cybercafe?
Our conversation here doesn't have to deteriorate into name-calling or
demonizing. We can go off and chew on it, and find holes in that person's
argument, so when we come back, we will have sharpened our minds in the
process of doing so. Some people are deliberately provovative, and others
timid.  That's just the way life is.

There are 4000+ people, mostly women, on this list. MOST of the 4000 never
write a word to the list. But people remain as subscribers largely due
to the quality of information that is being exchanged, to the lack of
flaming and the quality of discussion, and to Joan's firm hand in keeping
things from getting out of hand.

 To me, intellectual discourse means that people can discuss IDEAS with
passion and intensity without the recourse to violence that characterizes
so much of life. Cyberspace is a strange place; we are just learning how
to operate in it. WMST-L is a home to professors and grad students, independent
scholars, and others who may just be interested. We seem to have had a
rocky start to the fall semester but I hope things calm down as the
semester gets going.

You know your reply brought about so many associations.
First, the old civility and tyrants maxim.  But then I
remembered a course and book specifically written about
how the construction of civility was one of the fundamental ideological
and social control instruments in maintaining slavery
in the South. And then the works about the
construction of a lady like ideal (which is always very polite) and
control based on gender and class. then there was
control of women based on specific precepts of femininity (which is always
so  polite and never expresses legitimate anger at anything). I also
remembered Daisy Zamorra reflecting on power and  how many women who after
the Sandinista Revolution got into the old boys politics power
machine and became so much part of the machine, they
forgot (or never remembered) what transforming a hierarchical system
is all  about.   Elites aren't so bad once you're part of them,
isn't that true?

Expanding on the parallel of patriarchal and academic control,
did you notice that if someone writes to the list that they are hurt by
inequality in academia/women's studies, it's all very nice, but if someone
writes that they are angry, that's impolite?
women/subalterns can be hurt but not angry, is that the message?
This is very telling about how power dynamics
are lodged deep down in people's psyches and being
progressive is not as easy as writing about it.

I don't know if you realize that there are a variety of  people
who aren't so collusive/comfortable with academic power structures
but don't express themselves publicly like I did because there's a little
rope around their necks, and it's good-bye job, possibility
for a job, degree, etc., etc., if the kowtowing stops.

The result is a strategic, but no less hypocritical coerced politeness
(ranging from flattery to silence extremes) which I find problematic
most of the time.  Now if you took that rope off their necks, they would
speak, loud and clear, about their anger, frustration, and disgust
with a lot of the rotten stuff in the kingdom of academia.
And when "women" express their anger at "men" aren't they
always told they're out of line?

I can make people believe that I am powerful. I have also been known to
give the impression that I am tall when I am really only 5'4". I think it
is because I have always believed the words of Eleanor Roosevelt who said
that no one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

The "reality" however, is that I am as assistant professor who does not
 yet have tenure.  I have no particular power over anyone except the 120
undergraduates I teach every semester, and that is my power to help them
to think more clearly for themselves. If I could eschew grades, I would do so
but the Board of Governors won't let me. So much for power.

A little untenured professor at a state university is a person
who works in the trenches every day. There is little privilege, no
tower made of ivory, and barely enough in the way of comfort to do
my job. In the winter, my office is heated with a heater I bought with my own
money, and when it is too warm, it is ventilated with the fan I paid for;
my paycheck is so slender that I can barely keep my family afloat. Perhaps
you should rethink what "elites" are and who is in them.

And now I am weary of all this yelling going on around me, so I will
withdraw to lurker status for a while. As Peg Bracken used to say,
"I didn't come here to argue."

    I'd like to second the very sensible messages sent to the list
over the last few days urging both civility and respect for contrarian
views.  I urge this not because expressions of anger are unladylike or
possibly detrimental to someone's position in or out of the academy,
but rather because 6 1/2 years of running WMST-L have taught me that
the effective functioning of a large international e-mail list
requires civility.

    Yes, some of us might be perfectly happy to exchange flames
and insults.  But such behavior simply gives rise to more flames and
insults.  Mail volume soars, forcing many people with limited time,
limited disk space, and/or limited funds to sign off, thereby losing
the valuable information, discussion, networking, and community that
WMST-L provides, and depriving the list of what they can contribute.

    I do not want to see that happen.  Like many other people,
I value WMST-L very highly as a professional resource, and I want to
see it remain one.  It is not a playground, nor a boxing ring, nor
a group therapy session.  Those looking for playgrounds and the like
should consult Gender-Related Electronic Forums
(http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/forums.html) or Liszt (http://www.liszt.com)
for more suitable forums.

    Those who continue to wish to slug it out with other WMST-L
participants should do so privately or not at all.  Debate is welcome
on WMST-L, but flames, insults, and self-righteous proclamations
(all of which tend to trigger a deluge of mail characterized by more
heat than light) are not.

    I would like to see us move away from some of the topics that
have given rise to this message (the "chicana feminism" thread and its
development into "credentials and research").  I've found both subject
threads interesting, but recently they seem to have exhausted their
usefulness.

    Many thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

Frances was correct - there was a discussion about this last year on
WMST-L, and it can no doubt be retrieved from the archives.

If I remember correctly, it did start around the issue of advising a
student whether or not to do a Ph.D. in Women's Studies. I had
conversations with posters (on list and privately) and many (although not
a representative sampling) said they would not, as I remember.

Mary,

Enheduanna, high priestess of the goddess Inanna (predecessor of Astarte,
Aphrodite, etc.) in Uruk in Sumer, was the first poet and perhaps even the
first writer, whose name we know for sure.  The other candidate for "first
named writer" is her father, King Sargon of Agade, to whom some words
recorded in cuneiform on clay tablets have been attributed.  I've seen
dates ranging from 2750 B.C.E. to 2300 B.C.E. for K. Sargon and
Enheduanna. Maybe someone else on the list  can be more precise.=20

Her poems, written in first person, are addressed to Inanna.  Some of them
indicate that followers of a rival god, let by an unsavory character named=
=20
Lugalanne, temporarily stripped her of power and caused her to have to
flee, and tell of her restoration to her former position. =20

Some of her material is so sexual that it is not often anthologized, 'tis
more the pity. =20

one of my students has stumped me (which happens more often than i would

Good Provider first  come into discusion.  I have been able to find
references that suggest that as late as 1532 the concept of provider was
not yet male sex typed.  what i am trying to find out is approximately
when was the role of the good provider first sex-typed as male in the
literature?

Could you give a citation to the list about where to find her poems in

Subject:      info request--women as students

I am teaching a one-credit year-long Freshman Honors Colloquium this year for
our honors program students. Basically, they read a 10-15-page article each
week, meet to dicsuss it, and also discuss it electronically throughout the
week. Delightfully, all 12 of the students are bright and earnest women. This
semester, I have a full plate of readings about the liberal arts, how different
disciplines approach the world, and hgow technology helps or hinders. Since we
are a group of women, I'd like to do more gender-specific reading next
semester.
   Can you all suggest short accessible readings about how the education system
has served or failed women? I looked at REVIVING OPHELIA with the idea of
requiring the whole book as a text, but I think college freshmen feel
themselves to be beyond adolescence (all 12 are 18 years old). Something that
addresses how higher education serves bright women in different disciplines?
    Obviously, I don't really know what I'm looking for. If you had a group of
12 women in an honors program in all different majors, what might you give them
to read?
   Thanks for your help.

Hi Rosa,  I am part of a distant learner doctoral program.  Learners come
together on the Union Bulletin Board from 50 states and large number of
other countries.  We often refer to the opportunity for excahnge just as
you did about your experience with coffee houses and cafes.  It's rich,
(the coming together to exchange infor, as well as the coffee).  And well
worth the time we engage together.  Just as in those cafe's of yore, we
don't all have to agree with everyone or everything that is said there.
And more importantly, we can select whose table we will choose to sit at
(and hopefully be the ones others also  choose to sit at).  We each have a
role in making this a welcoming atmosphere, as well as a place where ideas
(not personalities) can be examined, chewed upon, turned about like a fine
gem to discover the multiple aspects.  And hopefully, we all grow in the
process.  Thanks for sharing that image.  It is a great one!

Peace,  Jacqueline Haessly   jacpeace@acs.stritch.edu   Image Peace!

shortly after the writing we call cuneiform was invented by the Sumerians,
and before Sumer became militaristic, this country had male and female
scribes. Then, when Sumer became militaristic and a ranking-class system
developed, women and men ceased to be egalitarian, and women were ousted
as scribes with the development of a system of education which was no
longer open to all, but confined to the children of the elites.  I believe
women were ousted from the educational syustem, and at this time caning
and the whip were   introduced as punishment for the students who were
now male.

I've spent my life thinking about the question of elites,
Rosie, and I can see so many privileges in the little information
you supply that you just seem to take so for granted. You have a job,
Rosie, do  you not? Has it ever occurred to you that millions
of people are denied that privilege?  You have a family, right?
You don't think that's privileged? You went to school, many,
many years?  You are teaching, isn't that a privilege? Never noticed that
many people are barred from the experience of even stepping into
a school? You have access to so much, including the Internet. How
many of your children did you watch starve to death? How many
years of your life did you spend at a maximum security prison? How many
times have you been battered, tortured, and raped?
How many years have you been mentally ill as a result of violence?
Are you a quadriplegic in a wheel chair, Rosie?

There are many types of privilege, and  I know of just a couple of
billions of people who do not have the privileges you do.
And it is sad that you're so oblivious to so many privileges that
enshroud people in academia.
Yes, you can retire to a little cafe any time someone
expresses anger at a structure of privilege in academia.
that's a prerogative of elites.

:/ shoot.  I had decided not to post anything to the list,
and wrote a reply back to rosie. but when i went to  save
my messages and drafts (which i have to do by sending them to myself
because of my caveman email program) i sent the draft to the
list accidentally.  :/. i know i've done this once
before some time ago, so i don't even know if you'll
believe me, but it's true. i can't simply save my drafts
and that's been causing me problems.

Jacqueline, I wasn't objecting to the Black IQ Test or, by implication, the
vocabulary test you give to show multiple meanings of words. I agree that
such tests can do what you say, "raise consciousness and (hopefully) change
attitudes."
    We have no dispute on intention. My concern is too give students tools to
understand for themselves and to make specific arguments. To do that, I was
I was suggesting that students understand how IQ tests operationalise the
theory that intelligence is a "thing" people are born with, some with more
of it and some with less - and tho there's no empirical evidence that the
"thing" exists, it's existence and the amount of it in people can be
inferred from scores on a test called an Intelligence Test. It's the
appearance of someting real that comes from the distribution of scores,
which students actually face not only in IQ tests but in spin-offs, e.g.
reading tests, SAT. I think it helps students to get a handle on specifics
in the tests themselves. I also think the assumed natural distribution
plays a role in distributing grades on class exams and course grades. Hard
to pin this down.
    I only mentioned distribution and related tests in my message, didn't go
into details because I discussed them some in connection with an earlier
thread in wmst, on GREs, didn't want to repeat that.
    A major worry, too, is test producers' claim they take cultural
differences into account. They do this by listing in their test
administration guides the groups on which the test was standardised (urban,
rural, etc.) and by tinkering with test items and administration
instructions. They seem to accommodate cultural differences, but don't
change the results.
    For instance, Educational Testing Service (ETS), the major producer of
standardized tests, recently added permissible time for taking a test. The
background explanation: women work better with less time pressure. A
feminist trying to help women, who is on the professional staff of ETS,
argued for this change.
    On the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) a couple of items
have been singled out to support charges of cultural bias. One asks what to
do if you cut your finger and it's bleeding. No credit is given for answers
such as 'suck on it,' described by critics as typical in Black children's
experience. (Note: I'm not saying it is.) The test producers COULD decide
to give one point or two (the maximum in this section of the test, as I
recall), defusing the charges. But changing an item or two doesn't change
the results, which come from the weight of all of them to get the results,
the desired distribution of total scores to confirm the hypothesis that the
distribution exists in reality and the inference of a biological base is
warranted.
    If I go into more specifics than others want to use, they won't. It may be
the bias of my background, a degree in Educational Psychology and a
professor of Education with a specialization in reading as well as a prof
in WS, emerita now. In both Ed and WS courses, the construction of
hierarchized sociality comes up, and goes differently in each course. In my
experience a a discussion of assumptions of what people can and cannot do
which includes a presentation of the structure of tests, with examples,
gives students something concrete to think about. Others likely have
different ways of doing that.

Thanks to those who pointed out that my first posting on this topic
referred to spoken use.  I searched my memory for cases in writing and
examined some old term papers but found no examples there, but a search of
an old English literature book, Snyder and Martin, A Book of English
Literature, MacMillan, 1927, prompted by an old memory, led me to the
following which might prove interesting. In a biographical section, the
authors state: "During the summer of the same year he eloped with
Harriet Westbrook...whom he married... His life with her came to an end
in the summer of 1814 when he left England withe Mary Godwin...In 1816
Harriet Westbrook Shelley drowned herself; shortly afterward Shelley
married Mary Godwin. By 1918 he was living in Italy...deprived by law of
the custody of Harriet's children." I remembered the use of the given name
here and on seeing it again, I remember the question arising long ago and
being explained by a reluctance to repeat a complete name once used, the
confusion of using the surname Shelley or using Westbrook alone. Since
her husband's and her father's surnames were confusing, brevity led to
the selection of her given name.  Interestingly, the authors used the
title Mr. for living persons and the surname alone for others. They also
refer to Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Mrs. Browning though she was not
living at the time.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

In "The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism," Heidi Hartman
discusses the rise of the family wage, tying it to the industrialized
west's need to expunge women from the labor force so that they could
contribute to the health of the laborer by working for him at home.

"Family wages [paying the man enough to permit him to support the rest of
the family, to be, then, a good provider] may be understood as
a resolution of the conflict which was occurring between patriarchal and
capitalist interests at that time."  In other words, tired, underfed
workers were not good for profit, a capitalist's problem, and the solution
in an already extant patriarchy was to exclude and thereby oppress women
(as opposed to any other group) by forcing them to stay at home and serve
the laborer for free by giving sex, child care, and the myriad other tasks
that we now call "women's work."  Union restrictions and exclusionary laws
sprang up to support this system by preventing women equal access to high
paying employment.

Previous to this early nineteenth-century shift, Hartman notes,
women were commonly in the labor force, "and in fact the first factories
used child and female labor almost exclusively."  The "family wage"
movement helped push women out of the factory and into the home,
contributing to their economic dependence and need for a good provider.

Hartman's essay, originally in _Women and Revolution_ (Boston: South End
Press, 1981), has been recently reprinted in _The Second Wave:  A Reader
in Feminist Theory_, ed. Linda Nicholson (Routledge 1997).

I am in the process of putting together a couple of grants for studying in
the areas of women and literacy. I am looking for conferences that will
address any or all of these issues:

barriers to women in education
adult literacy - esp. for women
education in relation to poverty
welfare and women
education/literacy or lack thereof in relation to poverty and welfare
educational opportunities for women with lower reading level skills
educational and literacy issues especially as they pertain to poor women, women
        of color, women in prison, women with disabilities, young mothers,
        immigrant women, and other disenfranchised groups of women

Also, if anyone is teaching in these areas (individual courses or a
"program") please let me know.

Thanks. I really appreciate it.

I believe that the first woman author whose name we know was Enheduanna, a
Sumerian priestess who wrote a hymn to the goddess Inanna. See "The
Exaltation of Inanna," ed. William Hallo and JJA van Dijk, Yale University
Press, 1968.

In her article "The Good Provider Role: Its Rise and Fall" (American
Psychologist 36:1-12, 1981), Jessie Bernard argued that the provider role
first emerged as a distinctively male responsibility in the United States in
the 1930s.  For a historical analysis of the emergence of providing as a
male responsibility in England and France,  see Louise A. Tilly and Joan W.
Scott, *Women, Work, and Family* (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1978).

    I don't know of one, but the UMBC Women's Studies home page links to
two sites that might be relevant:  InforM's job listings (mostly from
WMST-L) and the Feminist Majority's Career Center.  The UMBC link to these
is http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/jobsetc.html .

        I hope this helps.

Stories and Hymns from Sumer_.  New York:  Harper & Row, 1983.

   The fertility cult of Inanna thrived from ca. 3,500-500 B.C.E. at
Sumer, between the Tigris and the Euphrates rivers.

   As others have noted, the Sumerian poet/priestess Enkheduanna's poem
"The Exaltation of Inanna" has survived as the world's first poem by an
identifiable author.

1999 Berkshire Conference on the History of Women
Call for Papers
        The 11th Berkshire Conference on the History of Women, "Breaking
Boundaries," will be held on June 4-6, 1999 at the University of
Rochester, Rochester, New York, USA.  The Program Committee welcomes
proposals that transcend regional, disciplinary, and cultural
boundaries;
that break traditional boundaries of academic presentation and explore
innovative ways of presenting material and involving the audience.  The
Committee also seeks proposals that discuss pedagogy, public history,
collaborative research, and feminist activism.  The Committee encourages
international participation and panels that represent a diversity of
participants.

        The Gender-Related Electronic Forums listing
(http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/forums.html) has a listing for LEZBRIAN, which
includes a link to the LEZBRIAN web site.  On the web site is a link
providing address, phone, fax, email etc. info for Ellen Greenblatt and
the other LEZBRIAN listowner.

        Even if one doesn't know about Gender-Related Electronic Forums,
I would imagine that doing a search on lezbrian in a decent search engine
should also turn up the list's web page.  Finally, all lists running on
Listserv software (as opposed to Majordomo or others) have a provision for
reaching the listowner by the generic address [listname]-request@host
(in the case of Lezbrian, that's lezbrian-request@listserv.acsu.buffalo.edu
   I'm posting this on WMST-L as well as responding privately because this
kind of basic information may be useful to others as well.

Members of the List,
I have a student who is interested in doing her senior seminar paper
on the female hero and amazons.  she hasn't yet focused the topic,
but is wondering when the word "hero" was first applied to a female.
So far, what we find is the use of "heroine" rather than hero.  Also,
she's looking into the amazon figure and it metamorphosis in
literature.  Any hints on either/both of these?

Hi--I've got two questions I'm hoping someone can help me with:

1. Are there still states in which marital rape is not a crime? If so,
which states, and what action can a woman take in those states?

2. Is it true, as I've sometimes heard, that the Native Americans of the
Pacific Northwest had no incidence of rape until their first contact with
Europeans? If so, was this also true of other Native American peoples? And
are there other cultures that have or at one time had no rape as we know
it and if so, can anyone steer me to references? (I am guessing that an
anthropologist's definition of rape might be different from our legal
one.)  Finally, are there cultures in which rape is or was committed
predominantly by women? If so, are the victims women or men?

Thanks in advance. Please respond privately or to the list.

It is listed in the 1915 (first volume) of Best American Short Stories' Index

"The Good Provider" was reprinted twice that I have located so far.  First in

Allan Robinson, Houghton, Mifflin 1924 and in --Recent Short Stories-- ed. by
Margaret Pendleton & David S. Wilkins, Appleton, 1928.

The use of the term "Good Provider" is not explained, as if there is no need
for an explanation of something so commonly understood.  The story is filled
with the kind of ironies that Hurst does so well and that rely heavily on a
shared understanding with her readers, so it is obvious that the term, the
concept, was in common use well before 1914.

I hope this is useful.  Susan Koppelman <<huddis@aol.com>>

I am not sure if your student is focusing her attention on a particular
period or nation, but Simon J. Shepherd has a book that explores precisely
this issue in early modern British lit. (including plays and poetry)
called _Amazons and Warrior Women_.  Though I do not have the information
at ready recall, I believe he does do etymylogical work of the kind that
you mention here (i.e. -- first occurence of "hero" and "heroine")

I am in search of bibliographic help.  Has anyone read a review or essay
on Mary Pipher's _Reviving Ophelia_ that focuses either on her failure to
actually suggest the kind of cultural changes necessary to address the
problems  she discusses, or her final set of case studies "of
five strong young women?"  (I agree with the fact that they are strong.
What bothers me is that although she has dealt only with the problems of
white girls in the previous parts of the book, with the exception of two
American
Indians girls, in her final examples she points out that "two of the
young women are black, one is Hispanic and three are poor.  Properly
faced, adversity builds character."  It strikes me that if Pipher had
addressed the specificity of the issues faced by female adolescents of
color and of those who are poor, her calls for change would have to be
more thoroughgoing.)  I can't be the first person who has noticed this, and
I'd like to read any examples of such criticism.

Let me hasten to say that I have just finished teaching this book in a
course called "Stories of A Young Girl" and my students really liked it.
I think it would work well in an intro. class, especially paired with a
text like hooks _Feminist Theory from Margin to Center_ which provides a
coherent way of theorizing the issues Pipher raises in the book.  I would
be surprised if the 18 years olds in the group for whom an earlier poster
would think they "were beyond" the book.

The word "hero" was probably first applied to women at the same time as
the "ess" was dropped from authoress, actress, resulting in author, poet,
actor, hero, etc.. being used for women as well as for men.  This occurred
in the 1970s, I don't know the exact
date.  Ruby Rohrlich   rohrlich.gwis2.circ.gwu.edu

The cultures that have no rape, either in words or behavior, are discussed
by anthropologist Peggy Sanday.  I don't remember the name of the book but
if you look at a list of her works, the title of the book on rape will

    That the Good Provider is God, the single, male deity in the major Semitic
religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) seems clear from the capital
letters.  He provides nature, as Descartes explains it, gives and men the
minds  to comprehend its laws by right reasoning. The concept of the Good
Provider thus seems prior to the 16th century and may be the source from
which people who believe in that deity derive the understanding that men,
not women, provide the fundamentals for living.
    It may complicate matters for the student who asked about the  Good
Provider, but it would be useful, I think, to compare that belief with
others. At a feminist seminar in India, in a discussion of Indian
philosophy, the belief in one, male god was contrasted with a belief in
goddesses (included in the Hindu pantheon). Does it empower women, a
seminar participant asked, to have goddesses? A participant who is a
historian of ancient and recent India pointed out that deities come from
mythologies, which become associated with other systems of thought. The
politics of those systems in respect to gender relations came out in other
participants' calling attention to the difference between beliefs in the
attributes of goddesses and real women.
    A similarity of connections of religion to politics was striking to me in
my recent rereading of Elaine Pagels, a historian and admirer of
Christianity. She shows that religious insights and moral choices coincide
with practical ones and moral choices are often political choices; her
examples show how the Christian doctrine of original sin grounds the
acceptance of secular governance.
    The understanding of a link between religious beliefs and politics, made
explicit in relation to the politics of gender relations in India, is
unmistakable in the two very different cultural contexts.

I don't think you are "guilty" of the issue I want to raise.  I imagine you
are wanting something to use in class to balance the impact of the book
without being the one to do it in her own voice for pedagogical reasons, but
I would like to raise an issue about reviewing of books in general.

Does anyone think that a writer who, in a book that clearly analyzes
problems, is under an obligation to provide or to suggest solutions?  So
often I read reviews of books in which the writer is congratulated for a
clear analysis of problems but then chided much more vigorously than she has
been congratulated for not providing solutions.

I am VERY bothered by this.  First of all, someone who pays a lot of
attention to problems and how they work may not be the best person to provide
solutions because it mostly involves projecting models of health based on a
thorough going knowledge of illness, rather than on a study of health.
 Second, it takes tremendous energy and dedication and more often than not
courage to face the problems.  If someone has what it takes to do that, must
they also be required to conquor the additional task of figuring out how to
make things right before we take their analysis of what's wrong to heart and
set out as a community to look for solutions?  Third, what if the writer
provides a great analysis of the problems and suggests terrible solutions.
How is the value of the analysis of the problems affected by this?

Often, those who chide a writer for this kind of failure is only using the
chiding as a springboard to write about the reviewers' own ideas about
solutions.  It's not fair to the book or the writer, I don't think.

Any thoughts?

I agree entirely with Susan Koppelman's observations that writers are
often inappropriately discredited for not (also) providing solutions
to the problems they analyze.  This occurs on all political sides and
seems to show unreasonable expectations on the reviewer's (or
reader's) part that All Answers will come from one source. Susan is
obviously correct that the validity of the analysis is not affected by
the ability or inability to come up with solutions.

I've recently begun reading "Who  Can Speak: Authority and Critical
Identity" edited by Judith Roof and Robyn Wiegman (Urbana and Chicago:
University of Illinois Press, 1995).   There are a number of articles that
address not only the issues raised so eloquently by Max but also some of
the issues that have arisen in recent discussions of  Chicana feminism.

I've been thinking a lot about the discussions of chicana feminism.  My
experience at Cal State Northridge was the Chicana feminism was very well
established as a field before women's studies.  I As luck would have it,
last night I came upon my copy of  one of the early numbers of  Encuentro
Femenil --vol 1, no 2 published in 1974.  Anna Nieto-Gomez, one of the
editors, and also editor of curriculum guides "for the development of women
studies on La Mujer Chicana"  was a leader in establishing a Women's
Studies Minor at Cal State University, Northridge.  I recall that the
Chicano Studies program was already in place as we were developing the
Women's Studies program in 1974.

I think it is important to remember our (WS) history--to remember, for
example, that Chicana feminists were leaders on many fronts and that their
work has been foundational for women's studies.  This knowledge should
inform the way we think about Chicana feminism and its relationship to WS,
e.g.

Another book that may be relevant to recent discussions, and at which I'm
nibbling, is  "Feminist Genealogies, Colonial Legacies, Democratic Futures"
edited by M. Jacqui Alexander and Chandra Talpade Mohanty (New York and
London:  Routledge), 1997.   This is an exciting book in part because it
places the experience of women of color  (and especially immigrant WOC) in
the center, which makes for a very different conversation than if one takes
European-based women's studies as a basis and then asks about (e.g.)
Chicana feminism.

The woman who was looking for information on Chicana feminism might check
out Paula Moya's article in this book:  Postmodernism, "Realism," and the
Politics of  Identity:  Cherrie Moraga and Chicana Feminism."

Jackie

You can probably find the info you are looking for (about current stuff
anyway) in "A Guide to America's Sex Laws" by Richard A. Posner and
Katharine B. Silbaugh (Chicago and London:  University of Chicago Press),
1996.  Of course this info does change--though not *nearly* quickly
enough!--so you'd want to verify currency.

This film is currently showing in Chicago... and this film has created a
storm of controversy and debate... And for good reason.  This film is the
story of two men and their quest to destroy a woman for the fun of it.  "In
the Company of Men" doesn't portray misogyny and sexism in the cutesy
"boys-will-be-boys" style of television shows like "Men behaving Badly."
No, this film is blatant, angry, hateful, and spiteful... to say the least.
 The film draws a clear connection betwen the two main male character's
sexism and the cutthroat, competitive corporate culture where they work.

Hi,

I saw this in today's electronic version of the Chronicle of Higher
education, and would like to know more about it!  Is there anything that I
can give to my students to help teach them how to cite Internet info
properly?  Many of them use Internet sources, and I would sure like to see
them learning better methods of citing their sources!

*  THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PUBLISHERS on Monday introduced a
   new, voluntary system for electronically identifying material
   posted on the Internet. The association hopes that,
   eventually, publishers throughout the world will use the
   system on all books, articles, and scholarly journals to make
   it easier to obtain information about the origin and
   ownership of electronic material and about rights to and
   restrictions on its use.

i could be mis-speaking, but i think that the author is a therapist by
trade, and not to excuse any shortcomings on her part regarding race and
class issues, we therapists are not generally given *any* training on
these issues when in school. people are assumed to be *all* the same and
poorness or rage about racism is generally looked at as "poor adjustment."
it is shamful, this lack of addressing the these issues, but i have found
not all that unusal. i took a graduate class a few years ago, "readings in
feminist theory." most of the students were not in the AMS dept. and many
had great difficulty with the race/class issues. many were hostile and
defensive and really creamed the professor during feedback in the final
class. and these were "well" educated women, who already had 4 yr. degrees
in areas such as education, philosophy, social sciences, social work,
women;s studies and so forth. ophelia seems to have done a pretty good job
of pointing out to white, educated, middle class parents that their
daughters *are* affected by patriarchy, and they better start paying
attention to it and do something about it.

        what is the source of our first suffering?
        it lies in the fact that we hesitated to speak.
        it was born in the moment
        when we accumulated silent things within us.

Hello Betty:

Has your student looked at Camille Paglia's discussion of amazons in SEXUAL
PERSONAE--I know that CP is not everyone's cup o' tea.  However, she is
provocative and her discussion is a kick,

Hope all is well with you.

Many thanks to all who responded to my questions about support to students
who teach.  You'll be happy to know that I am now talking with our
university's Center for Teaching Excellence about getting a support group
for TAs started, and we are also getting a listsrev up and running for
those who cannot attend meetings.  Again, thanks so much--- your ideas
have not only hepled me, but will be helping many graduate students at
Ohio University.

Sincerely,

I refer students to "Electronic Styles: A Handbook for Citing
Electronic Information" by Xia Li and Nancy B. Crane, now in
its 2nd ed. (1996).  It's published in Medford, NJ by Information
Today, Inc.  (ISBN: 1-57387-027-7).  It's a paperback, around
$20 as I recall.

It is enormously detailed with lots of examples (http, ftp,
gopher, telnet, etc.) and runs about 200 pages.  The 1st ed
was based on APA (American Psychological Association) format.
This 2nd ed updates that (APA Embellished Style), plus adds a
second section that is based on MLA (Modern Langauge Association)
(MLA Embellished Style) format so that the handbook might serve
humanists as well as social scientists.

New editions of the APA Manual, Turabian, MLA, etc. have been
incorporating electronic citation formats, but none of them to
the extent of Li and Crane.

Friends,

I turn to this list as a community of friends who may be able to help me.
Joan, I hope it's OK that this message isn't about women's studies.
Anyone who replies, please do so privately, not to the list.

My younger daughter is currently involved in a college search.  She has
a diagnosed learning disability and we are looking primarily at colleges
with extensive academic support for same.  She prefers a small college
within a day's driving distance of Philadelphia.  A sort of counter-
cultural environment (not heavy Greek activity, liberal social attitudes)
would also be a plus.  She prefers a four-year program (and we are aware
that there are several excellent 2-year programs).  She is a good student
academically, got a good score on an (untimed) SAT, but has difficulty
with writing and spelling without the aid of word-processing.

Any suggestions?  Please reply privately.  Thanks.

(P.S. We already have an extensive list of colleges, but my reason for
posting here is trying to uncover programs we may be unaware of if they
are not widely advertised.)

Andrea,
    I am happy to report that in many counselor training programs, this is
changing.  My training did include intensive work in cultural diversity
and there is a growing body of work related to how culture interfaces
with therapeutic issues.  It's an exciting area!

The system announced by AAP has nothing to do with citations. For that, I
would suggest CITING ELECTRONIC MATERIALS WITH THE NEW MLA
GUIDELINES http://www-dept.usm.edu/~engdept/mla/rules.html


THe AAP system is for TRACKING access to digital information for purposes
of charging for each and every access and /or use. I did not see anything in
their announcement (and have not heard in their discussions of the Digital
Object Information) about educational use or "fair use."

While authors and publishers certainly have pecuniary interests to
protect (and a right to protect them), this is not an initiative that
educators and librarians should unreservedly support.

Ruth and anyone else who is interested:

I have an electronic document on citing electronic sources which I am almost
certain that I got from this list a couple of years ago.  I pass it on to any
student who asks me about this question.  I'm certain that it is among the
files that you can request from listserv.  I think the file is called CITING

Hope that helps.

This is a question for Women's Studies Programs.  How many of you

occur?

Also, if your program doesn't have such a thing, have you heard of Take

    The original "Hero" in Greek legend was a priestess of Aphrodite;
when her lover, Leander, died in the Hellespont while swimming to see her,
she drowned herself.

    The following should give you a good start; many focus on amazons
as historical figures as well as mythological image.

Take Back the Night Marches.  Here at West Virginia University the
Take Back the Night March is organized by the feminist student organization

appointment is solely within Women's Studies).  The event, however,
is co-sponsored by Women's Studies as well as other campus units.  I'm
not exactly sure when the first Take Back the Night was organized, but
it has been in existence for as long as I've been at WVU - since Jan.
1993.  It is the biggest event the Female Equality Movement (FEM)
puts on each spring and the students fund-raise and organize for it
starting in the Fall.  We are hoping that it will eventually be
a university rather than FEM organized event; the new head of the
Sexual Assault and Prevention Education office is interested in closer
participation.  Barbara Scott Winkler, WVU  BWINKLER@wvu.edu

Although I am not certain this was the first TBTN march, in 1978 Women
Against Violence Against Women (WAWAV) held a national conference in San
Francisco on "Feminist Perspectives on Pornography" and staged a Take Back
the Night March through San Francisco's porn district.  The conference led to
the publication of Take Back the Night (Laura Lederer, ed. 1980), a book of
readings by antipornography feminists.

I, too, may be using Ophelia in a course next summer. The course will be
for teachers.  I would appreciate suggestions for readings of research on
pre and adolescent girls of color, lower SES, bi/lesbian, physically
challenged... I've noted the lists of fiction recently, but
other suggestions for any related readings would be helpful.

Thanks,

Hello,
    I'm teaching gender in my family class right now.  Before I become
the professor teaching from the yellow notes. . . I need to update
some info and can't find where I got the information in the first
place.  Will I never learn to use cites in my lecture notes. . .

Anyway, I was giving the average height, weight, measurements, blood
supply, body fat %, hearing, etc. differences between men and women.

Can anyone tell me where I might find this info to update my notes??

Thank you.

Subject:      Re: Take Back the Night

I am curious about the evolution of Take Back The Night Marches. I know that
they began by including both men and women in most places (I marched in
Philadelphia very early in the 80s in such a march). At Colgate however there
is a battle every year about whether they should or should not include men.
In the past men have been excluded on the grounds that they make women
uncomfortable, or that women feel empowered when men are absent. Recently men
have been included, many more women and men have come out and they marches
have begun to have more of an impact on the campus.
I have been a strong advocate of getting as many people to march as possible
and linking the march to other education around violence on campus (rather
than having it be an isolated event).
I would welcome others' views and experiences on this issue of men on the
marches and how successful or unsucessful these events have been.

of the YWCA in Akron.  Other organizations are represented as well (Battered

I have not seen this film, nor do I care to.  However, from what
I have read, in fairness it is not precisely about a quest where
two men set out to destroy a woman.

Rather, the FIRST man, who is completely amoral and embodies
corporate competitiveness at its most rapacious, persuades
the SECOND man, who is fundamentally a decent man, to go along
with the game.  As the woman is destroyed, so is the second man.

One could therefore go with an interpretation that by passively
buying into the misogynous games of his charismatic, very male
companion -- by submitting to the worst of masculine culture --
the SECOND man loses his soul.

So it's not a clearcut line, where men are to dominate and
women are to be destroyed.  Rather, the vicious behavior of
the first man is enabled by the acquiescence of the second,
and the price he pays for his efforts to be admitted into this
culture of assaultive masculinity is to himself become the
final victim.

I think that it therefore could spark some very interesting
discussion about whether we are talking gender divisions or
the case of an apologist who goes against his own sense of
morality in his desire to be part of a culture that -- in
reality -- is NOT his genetic destination.  That is, just
because he is a man, does not mean he has to be rapacious.
And rapaciousness is not part of his natural self, but rather
is going AGAINST his natural self.  So he destroys himself
out of a misguided acceptance of what is male and what is
female.

OTOH -- I would be rather concerned with those who identify
with the FIRST character, the manipulator, the one who destroys
all around him for the sake of his own gain.  And I would
be concerned if, in viewing the movie (and this I woudln't
know because I haven't seen it -- besides, I'm not male!)
the men in the audience are drawn toward the FIRST character
and alienated from the weakness in the second character.

I personally can do without sadism and misogyny in fiction,
given that there is enough of it in real life ... but this
movie is NOT supposed to come down on the side of the
misogynist sadist -- whereas all too many action movies
automatically DO.

WMST members,

I have seen the movie, In the Company of Men, and although I found it to
be immensely disturbing, I thought it was a scathing critique of
corporate hegemonic masculinity.  I am thinking of R.W. Connell's
definition of hegemonic masculinity (hm) here.  Connell defines hm as
the dominant form of masculinity which is

"always constructed vis a vis other forms of marginalized and
subordinated masculinities as well as in relation to women.  The
interplay between different forms of masculinity is an important part of
how a patriarchal social order works."
R.W. Connell (1987: 183, 184).

To me, the movie illustrates how twisted and inhumane hegemonic
masculinity can be especially when placed in the context of corporate
america not only to women, but to "marginalized and subordinated
masculinities," and to anyone defined as "other."

Llike Karola I am pleased to report that my training program, at New
College of California, addressed specific components on dealing with
racial, cultural, and other  differences.  This is done through specific
course work, integration of diversity questions into all courses, and
having a diverse faculty.  It's not perfect, for sure.  But there is
awareness and commitment.

I would also add that lack of training by others does not excuse an
author's ignorance.  The author is responsible for the content.

The issue of whethger men should participate in TBTN marches is one that
comes up alot.  When I was teaching at Ball State, the TBTN march was
women-only, and the men did a separate vigil and did childcare.  at the
end was a rally and spekout that included both women and men.
To me, TBTN marches are about empowering women so that we can feel safe and
not need men to protect us (from...?).  I think the marches should be
women-only, symbolizing desire to feel safe as women without men.

There was a Take Back the Night march in October 1977 in Pittsburgh.
Presumably there were others at the same time on the coasts. Since 1978 I
have participated, on and off, in Take Back the Night marches in
Pittsburgh, Providence, and Ithaca, NY, sometimes as part of a university
contingent (the march always being a citywide effort) and sometimes
independently. For some of the earlier marches men were requested to march
towards the back of the line or at least not up front, to give women
visibility; in Ithaca men now hold a vigil and speak-out against violence
downtown while the women are marching, and are joined by the women for the
main rally. The point to be conveyed by trying not to have men in the march
is that it is WOMEN who are taking back the night, while at the same time
recognizing that there are men who reject all violence against women. I
compare this to women being requested not to participate in the black men's
Million Man march.

My personal opinion is that it is inspiring and uplifting to see men
committed to the causes typically referred to as "women's issues." I
think we, as a society, have more to gain by *including* others than we
do by exclusion of others.  I am tired of devisiveness.  I am tired of
the "us and them" mentality.  I know some wonderful human beings who
happen to be male who would enthusiastically march in support of women
to "Take Back the Night."  What is there to gain in saying "no, we don't
want or value your support because you have a penis"?

        Call for Participants:
Conference session on GOSSIP IN ACADEMIA
South Central Modern Language Association, November 12-14, 1998

I am seeking participants for a conference session/panel discussion on
gossip in academic life. Some possible topics: networking, background
checks, cronyism vs. meritocracy, academic urban legends, careers wounded or
enhanced, romantic and financial secrets, academic personages as subjects
and objects of gossip, lying and blurting, literary role models and
cautionary tales.

I'D PARTICULARLY LIKE PARTICIPANTS who might answer such women-related
questions as these: How is networking especially useful and enhancing for
women? Can secretaries and women faculty members form useful alliances? What
do we say to "this friend who has this problem" with sexual harassment from
a senior colleague in her department, one who'll vote on her tenure? What do
women know--and men don't--about academic men? How do we reveal
off-the-record information, such as about sexual harassers? How are women
portrayed in academic novels? What do academic women gossip about--and
should we?

I welcome inquiries, correspondence, whatever. The session proposal needs to
be completed by mid-late October, 1997. And please share this with anyone
else who might be interested.

Salmonson may be a poor historian, but she's a great storyteller.
I'm sure the books she has written and/or edited have incited an
interest in Amazons in many people.
I don't think there exists a netforum about historical Amazons
and female heroes (correct me if I'm wrong).  I'm wondering whether
it would be a good idea to get one started.  A forum with a focus
on the history and mythology of Amazons (including discerning the
one from the other!).

Another place to get information about books about Amazons and
female heroes, as well as actually getting copies of the books,
is the Feminist Science Fiction, Fantasy, & Utopia web pages at:

http://www.uic.edu/~lauramd/sf/femsf.html

I'll also have to recommend AMAZON.com(!) -- the name is most
fitting even if unintentional, their stock of Amazon-related
material seems to be bigger than even some specialized feminist
bookstores.  (http://www.amazon.com)

Subject:      in the company of men

I found this movie well-done as an accurate portrayal of  two prototypical
types of men in this culture.  However, it may be overly simplistic to see
the "less" patriarchal man as only a victim of the rapacious, evil one.
In some ways, this less overt violent evil man could be seen as even more
responsible for playing a role in victimizing the woman in the evil friend's
game, because he knew right from wrong supposedly, had some caring feelings/
capacity and should have known better--in other words, he should not be
excused as less responsible for simply going along and trying to be
accepted in the patriarchal society.  Men who are aware and have not been
"oversocialized" to patriarchal violent behavior and abuse may be the only
ones who are reachable and amenable to possibly choosing a different type
of way of living.

I also had the concern expressed by another poster on this topic that
men might identify with the evil, rapacious man and/or want to be like him
because he is the embodiment of patriarchal power and control and is "no
victim."  Of course feminists can see how the depth of his experience/
humanity is obviously limited by his abusive behavior, but it doesn't
appear that way in the movie and it may in fact not be that way in a
society that rewards those men the most highly as best meeting the standard
of traditional male socialization.

let the wonderful human beings who happen to have penises organize the rest
of their sex class and do whatever they need to do.  where is the
organized male outrage at the treatment of women and children?  off with
robert bly or john gray, or what?  denouncing (or joining) promise keepers or
the million man march or what?  what, in the name of all that's sweet and
holy, is so *damned* frightening about women declaring that they want a space
that they define?  why is every request at self-defined space denounced by
the term divisiveness?  i, along with karola alford, am sick of something.
i'm sick of having to explain over and over why defining my associations,
boundaries, affiliations, etc. is valuable and necessary.  why are such
attempts at maintaining my mental and spiritual health demonized as what's
wrong with this racist, sexist, heterosexist, male-supremacist, hypocritical,
necrophilic country?   as a korean-american woman said in one of my seminars
recently, why do the white folk get bent out of shape when the korean
students want to eat together in the cafeteria?  this may seem like a ramble
to some, but i am sick to death of reactionary double speak--whatever its
guises.  it may be helpful for listmembers to have a(nother?) look at a piece
of feminist history: "the woman identified woman", originally published in
1970, most recently in the anthology, _for lesbians only: a separatist
anthology_  [for whoever's keeping score, i am not now, nor have i ever in
the past been a separatist].  for another look at the ongoing refusal of men
to be traitors to male supremacy, see _refusing to be a man_, john
stoltenberg, (portland, or: breitenbush books, 1989) .
27 years after the declaration against lesbian-baiting: so much time; so
little change.

i don't see the equivalency betw. mmm and tbtn.  not all
gender-identified/defined space is created equal.
culturally- and/or religiosly-defined gender separations are not what's
at issue here.  moreover, voluntary sex/gender separatism is an
ahistorical construct in african*american* experience; we were forced
apart enough by circumstance. how have men-only spaces as they have been
undertaken in late twentieth century u.s. served to do anything other
than reassert allegiance to male supremacy, regardless of racial or
ethnic definition? any safe streets activity or re-defining masculine
mythologies that you know of, as a consequence of the mmm?  any women
reassured by promise keepers? what are the iron johns up to these days?
still blaming the mother?   oh, hell, are there any guys petitioning in
protest of women's disparate tee times at golf courses?

I'm going to step in on this because the discussion of men and TBTN has
changed shape so many times.  (Interesting, isn't it, how every year when
this issue returns we discuss the participation of men.)  Anyway, from my
point of view the women only marches were not remotely about exclusion of
anybody.  The idea was that women were going to TAKE BACK the night.  In
other words, the marches were a response to the carefully drilled messages
with which we grew up--a woman should never go out at night without the
protection of a man.  So the idea was that if women marched as a group
they could be out at night (in the street, in fact) all by themselves.
Kind of takes the "juice" out of it if men also march.  I haven't met a
man on this campus who claims to be supportive of women's rights who does
not understand this argument for a woman-only march.

Dear folks,

    interestingly, the two postings below (from Frances E. Woods and
Sarah Ullman) arrived back to back and have parallel messages that are
very dear to me.
    I absolutely agree with both of them.  Men have got to start
supporting feminist ideas and protests.  We have to support them publicly,
openly, loudly and endlessly.  We have to do so whether they originate
from women or men, and we have to do it in a way that respects women's
primacy in these issues.
    Too many men who are feminist have demonstrated absolutely no
spine when it comes to confronting other men's sexism/misogyny.  Those who
want to have my total support.  Please pass to them my e-mail address so
we can discuss this further.
    Thank you to all of the great, powerful, towering women, present
and past who have carried on the fight.
            Bill Oetjen

I knew when I posted my opinion of including men in TBTN that it would
generate debate.  Being new to this listserv, I guess I wasn't prepared
for the level of *anger* that would accompany the debate.  I have
received some off-list responses to my post that imply I am some sort of
demon, perhaps a man in disguise, or just plain stupid.  I am entitled
to my opinion on this issue and am saddened that we cannot discuss this
without personal attack.  While I understand, validate, and in some
cases, share the anger and outrage, I do *not* believe that war is a
very effective solution to the divisions in our society. I remain a
*female* feminist who stubbornly believes that violence against women is
not a "women's issue," but is a *society* issue that demands the
attention of all human beings.  I believe that excluding and judging
people solely on the basis of gender is wrong, whether it is done by men
or by women.

WISE DIVISION "CULTURAL PRACTICE AND COMMUNICATION" WORKSHOP AT THE THIRD
EUROPEAN FEMINIST RESEARCH CONFERENCE IN COIMBRA: LAUNCHING EUROPEAN WOMEN'=
S
BOOK REVIEW

        I am happy to inform WISE members that the workshop of the WISE Div=
ision "Cultural Practice and Communication", which I had the priviledge to
chair =in Coimbra during the workings of the Third European Feminist
Research Conference this past July, has successfully reached its goal by
providing a forum for an active dialogue among countries and across
disciplines on the work feminists do in the humanities.
        Presentations by Tobe Levin (Germany), Montserrat Palau (Spain), Li=
ana Borghi and Rita Svandrlik (Italy), Ailbhe Smith (Ireland), Hilda
Roemer Christensen
(Denmark) pointedly illustrated the state of the art of Women's Studies in their
specific countries by focusing on certain selected but crucial and examplary
theoretical issues that enliven the contemporary international feminist debate.
Speaking from their own areas of scholarly expertise (literature, the arts,
communication, history), the panelists in various ways pointed out the fruitful
exchange in their disciplines between their own national specificity and the
international discourse.
        The workshop's leading question was whether the English language which
 provides
a useful and unrenounceable international means of communication doesn't
too
often risk being passively employed by non-anglophone speakers as a vehicle
which translates through cooptation and appropriation all socio-cultural
realities into concepts and articulations which are only proper to anglophone
contexts, especially the U.S. and England. Consensus was reached on the need for
European feminists to create and make available internationally a discourse
which, although traveling in English, is less dependant on the influence of
anglo-saxon cultures=D1in other words, a discourse which enriches the English
language with multicultural figures, words, and ideas.
        To this purpose, the panelists enthusiastically welcomed and supported
 Tobe
Levin's well-articulated proposal to launch the publication, written in English,
of a European Women's Review of Books Published in Languages Other than English.
The review's main target groups are academics and publishers who may otherwise
remain unaware of important feminist work, simply because of a language barrier.
The review's existence will depend on the volunteer work offered by WISE members
who are willing to write reviews and translate publisher's catalogues as well as
reviews published on feminist journals interested in collaborating. This
service will enrich the international feminist scholarly community as a
whole.
        Tobe's initiative met the approval also of a number of women in the=
 audience
from other countries (among others, Biljana Djcinovic-Nesic from Belgrade's
Women's Studies Center offered her collaboration as editor and the translation
of a bibliography of Feminist Theory and Women's Studies she published in 1996,
 and Sara Goodman from the Center of Women's Studies in Lund, Sweden,
offered her steady collaboration). I had the pleasure to conclude a successful
workshop=
 by inviting those who had offered their committment to the birth of our
Review= to
contact me or Tobe in writing through the WISE-List. Now I would like to
encourage the largest possible participation in a discussion that hopefully=
 will soon lead us to define the list of the Review's editorial board. I
will never emphasize enough the importance that this list include the largest
possible number of countries and areas of expertise and expect to hearfrom an
enthusiastic group of possible collaborators soon.
  Please contact Tobe Levin or Giovanna Covi, if you are: 1)intersted in joining
the editorial group (which should be extensive and representative of our whole
constituency); 2) ready to suggest and translate prsentations/reviews of
feminist books in various fields not yet available in English; 3) willing to
 contribute short (2-3 page) reviews.

At the Michigan campus in Ann Arbor, there has been  a separate
rally for men, after the women as a group have departed to travel
a route through campus where women have been assaulted.  I like the
idea of men doing child care.

I think it usually controversial because at issue is what role
do men serve at a rally for and about women.  I think that support
from men may better be served at male gatherings where women aren't
welcome or well received.

the first take back the night marches antedated the San Francisco march by a
long time.  In fact, when I was asked to write something for the anthology
you mentoned, I had no idea it included an antiporgraphy slant to the whole
anthology, since none of the take back the nightmarches bgefrore that did,
to my knowledge.  I am more of a free speech advocate and felt burned by
contributing an introduction to an anthology i hadnot read first, and have
never done that again.

We had marches before that in Boston and on Cape Cod. The focus was against
violence against women and the issues we marched about and rallied about
were rape, sexual harassment on the streets and blaming the woman for
violence.  I would say that the first marches were in the early mid 70's.
Like maybe '75?

The idea was that women had been trained be afraid to go out at night
without male protection, and that together we would demand to have the right
to use the streets at night. We would no longer allow a woman alone at night
to need to have excuses or special pleading to defend her presence on the
streets.

Subject:      Re: take back the night

In the time I've been on WMST-L, it seems to me the debate about the
inclusion of men in TBTN marches has surfaced several times.  Though I'm
usually a proponent of including men in all things feminist, I've accepted
the reasoning for TBTN marches being a women's only event.  I don't really
want to rehash that issue.

However, in the course of reading these messages, suddenly the son Holly
Near and Ronnie Gilbert do, "Take Back the Night", popped into my head.
Does anyone know more about the context of this song?  I believe it was
written by a man, and on a tape I have Ronnie identifies it as such.  I
thought it was meant to describe the events that gave rise to the first
TBTN demo -- but I don't know that for sure.  One of the lines is, "Now
out in the street there's a vigil, with thousands of candles for light.
Arm-in-arm women are marching with men -- they sing `Take Back the Night'."

This seems to imply that men's participation marked the earliest TBTN
marches.  Does anyone know more about that song and how it came to be
written?  This would also throw light on the initial questions about the
origins of these marches.

I guess I'd say that exclusion of a group always requires some
justification and shouldn't be by default (much like the exercise of
authority by one person or group over another always requires
justification and shouldn't be exercised by default).  In the case of TBN
(and many other feminist activities from which men have been excluded),
I've never thought that the exclusion of men expressed some negative
judgment on the individual characters of all men, but factors relating to
the nature and political efficacy of the march.  Because the ability
of women to walk the streets at night *without* the company of men
is the point of the rally, and because that point is a politically
mportant one from a feminist perspective, the exclusion of men has a
justification that anyone supportive of feminist aims (woman or man) can
accept.  In that sense, the exclusion isn't comparable at all to the kinds
of exclusions from social practices and privileges that have historically
been imposed on women by men.

Having participated in support/child-care rallies for men at TBN marches
in Ann Arbor and Portland, I think these can be useful alternatives to
male accompaniment on the marches if some men feel they're too
"supportive" to be left out.

Hi folks. I'm interested in finding out whether you've used any recent
(documentary or feature) films in teaching about violence against women,
particularly domestic violence and rape including acquaintance rape. I'm
going to teach a January term class on violence against women where
we'll have plenty of time to watch lots of movies: The Accused, Bhaji on
the Beach and Question of Silence (also Calling the Ghosts, I hope) are
already on my list. I'd be particularly interested in movies that appear
to be "about" something else for the most part but also talk about these
kinds of violence to make a particular point. What's been particularly
good for classes? I'd be happy to compile a list of responses and post
to the list.

TBTN marches been able to raise enthusiastic support from women of color
and partiicularly from immigrant women? Were these in "women-only"
marches? In what ways were the communities involved?

Even though you mentioned it already in your post, let me put in a loud
second for the motion in favor of _Calling the Ghosts_.  Not only does the
film confront head-on an unfortunately current issue, but it also ends
with a very empowering message (the central women going to the Hague to
fight back with international legal assistance against their attackers).
The students in an international women course last year were positively
riveted by it and said as much in the course evaluation at the end of the
semester.

 WMST-L readers:

        I neglected to mention that this conference is in NEW ORLEANS. Come
gossip about gossip in New Orleans (what better place?)

       Call for Participants:
Conference session on GOSSIP IN ACADEMIA
South Central Modern Language Association, November 12-14, 1998

I am seeking participants for a conference session/panel discussion on
gossip in academic life. Some possible topics: networking, background
checks, cronyism vs. meritocracy, academic urban legends, careers wounded or
enhanced, romantic and financial secrets, academic personages as subjects
and objects of gossip, lying and blurting, literary role models and
cautionary tales.

I'D PARTICULARLY LIKE PARTICIPANTS who might answer such women-related
questions as these: How is networking especially useful and enhancing for
women? Can secretaries and women faculty members form useful alliances? What
do we say to "this friend who has this problem" with sexual harassment from
a senior colleague in her department, one who'll vote on her tenure? What do
women know--and men don't--about academic men? How do we reveal
off-the-record information, such as about sexual harassers? How are women
portrayed in academic novels? What do academic women gossip about--and
should we?

I welcome inquiries, correspondence, whatever. The session proposal needs to
be completed by mid-late October, 1997. And please share this with anyone
else who might be interested.

1) RE: Violence against women.  I am the former program director of the
Center for the Prevention of Sexual and Domestic Violence.  I have
spent years and worked with thousands of men (as well as women),
attempting to inform and persuade that knowledge about, and actions to
prevent and appropriately respond to violence against women, children,
and other vulnerable persons is a *societal* issue, an *ethical* issue, a
*theological* issue, an issue of *professional competency*, a *political
and public policy* issue, a *health* issue, an *international* issue, a
*legal*issue, and finally a justice issue--as opposed to a so-called
women's issue.  However, I still don't see men of good will rushing to
have bake sales, or tractor pulls or 10k walks or triathlons or golf
tournaments to support the local sexual assault center or battered
women's shelters.  I *have* seen religious congregations take those
actions, however; and the majority of at least mainline, Christian
congregations continue to have more active female than male participants.
I eagerly await evidence of *any* significantly organized movement or
activity (such as National Coalition Against Sexual Assault or the
National Coalition Against Domestic Violence) by those whom John
Stoltenberg refers to as "penised persons", not only denouncing, but
also acting to end violence in society--whether against other men,
children, gays, women, whomever. In the absence of same, my critique
stands.
2) RE: Anger.  See the excerpt below.  For full text, see "The Uses of
Anger: Women Responding to Racism", _Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches
by Audre Lorde_ (Trumansburg,NY: Crossing Press, 1984).  I never cease to
be amazed at the expectation that one who professes and lives out passion
for justice and right relationship is required to check anger (or, more
accurately, anything that is perceived as such), as a legitimate aspect
of said passion, at the door.  Several years ago, I wrote an essay on
"mandatory niceness" as an impediment to healing and justice-making.  I
see the mandate is alive and well. This thread may seem to some to have
veered far afield from WS issues.  However, I want to make the case that
issues of difference and the conflicts ensuing therefrom, whether
dichotomized as women/men, anger/nicety, divisiveness/inclusivity, or
addressed in their messier and more complex multiplicities, are the stuff
of which classes in women's studies, as well as other disciplines, are
made. Insofar as these remain the issues our students, colleagues,
and institutions encounter daily, they remain, in my understanding WMST-L
concerns.

Thanks to you, Jeff, and Bill Oetjen.  I appreciate your contributions of
political analysis, along with historically grounded, meaningful, and
creative alternatives to *me, too; me, too* forms of involvement by
feminist-supportive men.  One of the effects of this thread (and its
coincidence with the death anniversary of the former director of Men Stopping
Violence [MSV]) has been to prompt me to be in touch with my allies at MSV.
This, for me, has been what Martha Stewart might call, "a good thing."

Try the Women's Resource and Action Center (WRAC) at the University of
Iowa.  130 N Madison Iowa City, IA  52242  (319) 335-1486.  They have a
long and eventful history with the city and university.  I think they could

Dear Friends-

The gay students on my campus are planning a peaceful protest against a
speaker who is suggesting that the gay life style is both a choice and
an  evil choice.  This protest is Monday. They came to my office with
their needs late yesterday afternoon and I have a massive case of the flu
and can't do what i would like to help them.

However, this I can do. For their fliers we would like to use the quote
from the holocaust that generally refers to the idea that when the Nazi's
came for specifc groups no one helped until there was no one left.  It
goes roughly "when the Nazi's came for the Jews, I turned my back, when
they came for the ....when they cmae for me there was no one left."  Does
anyone have this quote accurately and the source.  If so, please post me
privately  at npearson@runet.edu

Thank you so much

As a follow up to the posting on the Battle Creek National Women's
Conference, which celebrates Sojourner Truth's 200th year, I wanted to
make list members aware of a wonderful woman who does performances at
colleges, universities, schools, and community organizations.

Alice McGill is a professional storyteller; she is currently lecturing and
performing at Battle Creek, MI as part of a month-long Kellogg fellowship.
Originally from North Carolina, McGill has received numerous awards for
her work, which also includes stage, TV, and movie appearances.

She performed at a leadership seminar I directed this past May, and
she is *fabulous.*  She not only brings Sojourner Triuth alive, she also
challenges her audience's assumptions and undermines historical cliches.
It is truly one of those experiences that leaves you awed.

She can be reached at P.O. Box 1607, Columbia, MD 21044, 410/799-0627.

The quote you're referring to is by the Protestant minister Martin
Niemoller [the o has an umlaut; my e-mail doesn't have int'l characters]
(First, they came for... .).  I don't have a citation source, but if your
students go to the library and look him up, it'll be there.  My caution
about its use, however, is that this same pastor--though eventually
coming to oppose *Nazism*, was nonetheless, as was true of other
Christian celebres of the Nazi era (e.g. Karl Barth), an antisemite.
Niemoller also made the following statement:
    "We speak of the 'eternal Jew' and conjure up
    the picture of a restless wanderer who has no
    home and cannot find peace.  We see a highly
    gifted people which produces idea after idea
    for the benefit of the world, but whatever
    it takes up becoms poisoned, and all that
    it ever reaps is contempt and hatred because
    ever and anon the world notices the deception
    and avenges itself in its own way."
                (Daniel Jonah Goldhagen.  _Hitler's
Willing Executioners_.  (NY:Knopf, 1996, 112)
Chilling, though neither isolated nor idiosyncratic anti-Jewish
commentary.  Despite Edward Said's conception of "traveling" theory, I am
cautious of the ways that de-contextualized quotations travel among both
proponents and opponents of ideas, such as the use of "essentialist"
versus "choice" arguments by both gay bashers and gay activists. See, for
example, the Annamarie Jagose's discussion of the multiple uses of pro
and con arguments in _Queer Theory: An Introduction_.
Just as many U.S. liberals hold conflicting, racist beliefs about African
Americans, many  so-called champions of Jews in modern, as well
as earlier periods of history, dating back centuries, held views such
that one might conclude, 'with friends like these, who needs enemies?'.
Thus, using Niemoller may result, in addition to reinscribing
decontextualized appropriation and forcing questionable equivalancies, in
backfiring.

May I suggest that anyone attending this conference, take time to visit
the grave of ST, it has become a tradition for all African American women
who are accepted into the Kellogg leadership program (I am a group 14
fellow) arrange some time during our stay in exciting Battle Creek to go
as a group to her grave and gave thanks to the doors she opened as well as
a group agreement to "keep on keeping on." as this woman's life is
celebrated let us not forget the recent battle fought by Black women's
group to have her bust place in Washington among other women leaders, as
she was not to be orginally placed in the group of "women" deemed to be
feminist.( and still has not, or a smaller stature will be placed
somewhere nearby I think, (maybe even lower, closer to the brooms?)
Ah well, she really knew what she was doing when she asked "Ain't I A
Woman." So celebrate the "performance" of this "sheros's" life by all
means, but let us not forget, three years until the 21th century, her
question has yet to be addressed.

I didn't know that.  My thanks for posting it.

I too am uneasy about the widespread use of "First, they came for the
Jews.... And when they came for me, there was no-one left to help me"
(this is from memory: the last bit is probably slightly wrong)
My reason is different.

This is an argument for solidarity that rests on prudence.
Tactically, that may make sense.  In principle, I do not
think we should help others--I do not like my
phrasing, I have to post in haste--because we too might
need help.
I shall give a trivial and individual-sounding example.
Many of the people of this City help me when they see
the braces on my hands.  They do not do that because
they might need that help some day--insofar as I can tell;
and I suspect if that _were_ the reason, more people
would help!  They act because they perceive a need.

I know that such conduct costs far far less than a stand
against Nazism in Hitler's Germany (e.g.).  And I do
not want to suggest I am capable of that kind of
courage: I do not know.  But let us not forget the
people who sheltered Jewish people, and others --
in Germany, Holland, Italy... -- at a possible massive
cost.

> Niemoller also made the following statement:

(etc.)

I did hear that the meaning of this piece was disputed--
I have seen it, I did not know it was Niemoller--
does anybody know?

I haven't seen this yet (and as I now work in rape crisis and have to
protect my affect a lot, I don't think I'll be ready to in a while), but
I have heard in various reviews that the woman "seduced and scorned" is
deaf. Apparently, the two men take advantage of this by disparaging her
in her presence. This, if true, could lead into a discussion of women's
awareness of male manipulation/violence/patriarchy. Also, it raises many
distrubing points about men's treatment of women and others with physical
challenges. While it sounds to me like this film could be a useful
pedagogical tool, I wonder whether it shouldn't be presented as optional
(like "The Accused" often is)--not for everyone, and then with some
preparation.

In the 1980's there were two feminist bookstores in NYC. Today there are
none that I know of--and I am writing to remind everyone on this list
that if you have a feminist bookstore in your town, SUPPORT IT!  Order
all your books there, buy books as gifts for friends and relatives
(birthday, ;holiday, you name it!), send your students there if you are a
teacher, make sure all your feminist friends know about the store and go
there.
 I volunteer at our local feminist bookstore--In Other
Words--here in Portland and I can tell you that keeping it alive is a
struggle....

We are developing a Women's Studies Major at a presently all female
college that is seriously considering becoming co-ed in the very near
future.  I am working with another faculty member on this project and
would like to hear from others who have undertaken this task.  I am
mostly looking for suggestions for core courses for a WS major at the
bachelor level.  I'd appreciate any suggestions you could give
us!!!!!!

Hard to believe that there are *no* feminist bookstores in NYC, isn't it?
I'd like to second everything Johanna said in her post! (copied below)

There are three feminist bookstores in NY state:

        My Sisters' Words
        304 N. McBride St.
        Syracuse NY  13203
        (315) 428-0227

        Silkwood Books
        633 Monroe Ave.
        Rochester NY  14607
        (716) 473-8110

        Panacea Books Ltd.
        39 N. Main St.
        Port Chester NY 10573
        (914) 939-4500

--the store in New Jersey might be closer, though:

        Pandora Book Peddlers
        9 Waverly Place
        Madison, NJ 07940
        (973) 822-8388

There will be a complete, updated list of feminist bookstores in both the
U.S. and Canada in the back of the 1997 Feminist Bookstores' Catalog (on
press now; available at the end of the month). You can pick this up for free
in your local feminist bookstore, or we can send it to you (although we have
to ask for $2 to cover postage and handling).

Dear Group,
    For a colleague who doesn't have access to the list, I am posting
this request. He is looking for poems about the uterus by women, and has
found two: One by Anne Sexton and another by Lucille Clifton. He is
wondering if there are more that we know of, and if so could you please
reply privately to me. He thanks all of you in advance for your help!

Sad to say, the only feminist bookstore closed down about 2 years ago. But
there's a fair-sized women's studies section in Barnes and Noble at 18th
Street and 5th Ave, also at the new one on Astor Place. Also at the St.
Marks Bookstore now at 9th St. and 3rd Ave. Also at Strand's on Broadway
and 12th; big collection of second hand books, reviewer copies there.

Happy to say that there's a terrific feminist bookstore called Beyond Words in
Park Slope, Brooklyn that's opened in the last year.  It's a real community
gathering place in what's affectionately called Dyke Slope (highest density of
lesbian households in the U.S. according to the 1990 census) for feminists,
queers, and activists of diverse progressive bents.  It's adjacent to Rising
Cafe, a lesbian run cafe, and music lounge where local feminists hang out and
where Manhattanites find a reason to expatriate to the outer boroughs.  If you
really want to make a weekend out of it, you can also visit other neighborhood
finds including the Lesbian Herstory Archives, Brooklyn Women's Martial Arts'
Center for Anti-Violence Education, The Brooklyn Center for Lesbian and Gay
Arts and Artists at the Gowanus Arts Exchange and OUTmedia.

There are NO feminist bookstores in NYC!! Judith's Room closed at least 2-3
years ago. As big as NYC is, there is just too much competition and too
high rents and too little community support for a feminist bookstore to
survive 9saddly on all accounts).

The only feminist bookstores in New York STATE are:
Panacea in Port Chester
Silkwood in Rochester
and
My Sisters' Words in Syracuse

sad but true.

I am using Rosewood, the recent video about a white woman who covers up
her victimization by her husband by allowing an African American man to
be confronted by the white community on a rape charge in 1920s Florida.
It is part of a section in my Women and Violence course that focuses not
only on how sexual assault allegations have been used against communities
of color, but also to begin to explore how women of color have been asked
to avoid accusing brothers.  I use an episode of Frontline called
Clarence Thomas, Anita Hill, Public Hearing, Private Pain.  It includes
interviews
with people like Paula Giddings.

I am supporting "Rosewood" with:
from P. Giddings _Where and When I Enter_, "To Sell My Life..."
from bell hooks' _Ain't I a Woman_, "Undeclared War: African American Women
    Writers"
from Michael Dyson "The Plight of the Black Man"

I am supporting "CT, AH..." with:
James Jones' "Whites Are from Mars, O.J. Is from Planet Hollywood..."
    in Off White
and I am considering looking at a chapter of Jill Nelson's book called
    _Straight, No Chaiser_

I would welcome hearing about other violence against women films,
or materials that have been particularly effective in connecting gender
and race/ethnicity/class for students.  I will track down "Calling the
Ghosts"
soon!

Talking Leaves, 716-837-8554, 3158 Main Street, Buffalo (near the south
campus of State University of New York at Buffalo) has many feminist
titles.  Yes, this may be a bit far from New York City (so are Rochester
and Syracuse); however, several years ago a friend from California
planning a visit asked if she stayed with us could she ride the subway to
Times Square.

I would appreciate knowing where to obtain the film 'Calling the Ghosts'.
It sounds like it could be useful for a class on women's health I'm
currently teaching. Thanks very much,

I thought Rosewood was an excellent movie.  Two caveats:

That there was no analysis of the white woman's point of view; she was
simply made to be the villain.   Why did she hide the abuse by the man (not
her husband as I recall) who beat her?  What were the forces that caused
her to place blame on an African American man?

On the other hand, the film gave a great deal of understanding attention to
the white male storeowner placing him more at the center than necessary and
pretty much excusing his exploitation of African American men and women and
his white wife.

A colleague in our WS program here at the University of Northern Colorado
has asked me to post this request to the list.  Does anyone know of or
have access to a "multiple choice"-type testing instrument that can be
used in an introductory WS course to assess knowledge level of students at
the outset of a course?  I know that multiple choice tests are really a
difficult way to assess this kind of thing, but she's looking for
something that could provide a sort of benchmark regarding students'
beliefs/attitudes/ideas, etc.

If anyone knows of such a thing, please reply to me privately at
samogfo@bentley.unco.edu.


Thank you in advance,

Jackie,
The motivation for hiding the abuse was to hide the fact that she was
having an affair.  She could not charge the man who beat her with assault
since as a married woman she was not supposed to be with him in the first
place.

Secondly, the forces that caused her to place the blame on an African
American male involve the stereotype of African American men as rapists and
the erroneous belief that all African American men lust after white women.
During the period in which the film takes place, lynching of African
American men (and women) was common - often based on false and imagined
assaults on white women.  Interesting note - it is still the cause today of
many abuses.  Remember the case aired on 911 in Massachusetts when a white
man, who killed his pregnant wife and was shot claimed the crime was
committed by an African American man and it was later brought out that he
had committed the crime himself?

ye-ah....those were rhetorical questions, questions that I think were
inadequately addressed by the film.  With the result that the portrayals
white woman, and many of the black characters were flattened.

Someone mentioned in passing that Park Slope, Brooklyn, has the highest
density lesbian population according to the 1990 census.  Since the census
does not ask for sexual preference, what proxy is being used to come up w/
a figure?  Dwellings shared by adult "unrelated" women?
BTW, I lived in the Slope for ten years and have no doubt that it IS the
most lesbian neighborhood in the U.S.  I just would like to know what the
data being cited are.
Thanks.

"emma" (now defunct feminist bookstore in buffalo, NY) and "silkwood" in

     The actual events of the 1923 Rosewood massacre still
     reverberate for the people of Florida.  I would caution
     against analysis of the film's portrayal of the people and
     events of Rosewood without comparison to what is actually
     known of them (not nearly enough, unfortunately).  For that,
     I recommend two sources (in addition to contemporary news
     accounts and recent legislative records):

     1)  D'Orso, Michael. Like judgment day: the ruin and redemption
     of a town called Rosewood. New York: Boulevard Books. 1996.

     2)  A documented history of the incident which occurred at
     Rosewood, Florida, in January 1923 : submitted to the Florida
     Board of Regents 22 December 1993 / principal investigator,
     Maxine D. Jones ; co-project director, Larry E. Rivers ;
     investigators, David R. Colburn, R. Tom Dye, William R. Rogers.
     PUBLISHED: [Tallahassee, Fla. : Board of Regents, 1993]

     What "actually happened" (in particular the events that
     precipitated the massacre and the destruction of Rosewood)
     is still disputed in Florida, and it was only three years
     ago that the Florida Legislature passed a bill providing for
     monetary compensation for surviving victims and their
     desendants.  In part the delay was typical of the
     conservative nature of Florida politics (the 19th amendment
     was not ratified until 1969!), and in part the result of the
     literally unspeakable trauma suffered by the residents of
     Rosewood, many of whom would not talk about the incident,
     even to family members, for decades after it occurred.

     (When the legislature held hearings in 1994 regarding the
     proposed "Rosewood claims bill," several survivors and
     descendants testified about the events.  Videotapes of these
     hearings show that their testimony is given in an almost
     matter-of-fact manner, yet is riveting.)

The current discussion about films--especially ROSEWOOD, which I admit not
yet having seen--brings to mind a Gwendolyn Brooks poem:  "A Bronzeville
Mother Loiters in Mississippi; Meanwhile a Mississippi Mother Burns
Bacon."  It frames the Emmett Till case from the white woman's perspective
(Brooks is, of course, Black)--contrasting the supposed sexual threat
posed by the adolescent black boy to the actual physical, sexual, and
social threat posed by the woman's white husband (one of the lynchers).
The poem hinges on a moment of potential re-identification for her.
It might provide an interesting accompaniment to class discussions on
"Rosewood"--leading into some of the analysis that one poster has
identified as lacking in the film.  (There is also a second poem, "The
Last Ballad of Emmett Till", I think its called, which i believe takes the
black mother's viewpoint).

A Different Light (gay/lesbian) 8853 Santa Monica Blvd, LA

Midnight Special (politics) 1318 3rd Street Promenade, Santa Monica

Los Angeles is pretty notorious for it's lack of bookstores.  In the yellow

Yes, Sisterhood Bookstore located near UCLA is a wonderful place that has
been around since the early 1970s and is still owned by two of the three
original founders.

Hi! I work at the Women's Center on campus and one of the things that we
offer faculty & students involved in the Women's Studies program is help
with research. Currently, I am working on a few projects and I would like
to know if anyone has information about the following topics which might
be useful: 1)information on "diversity minors" - do any exist, and if so
where can I find them?  2) analysis or critique of jokes that are
offensive/abusive to women, and 3)advice from mothers or grandmothers on
life and how to live it. I appreciate any help that you can give me.
Please respond privately. Thanks!

Subject:      Film on Violence Against Women

There are lots of films that contain lots of violence against women. There
are, however, very few feature films made by feminist filmmakers that try to
use the medium of film to oppose violence to women. A couple of years ago I
started to try to figure out why that was the case and to look for some
examples of feminist filmmakers who did seem to be doing this and analyze how
they did it. The filmmakers I looked at were Diane Kurys (France), Jutta
Brueckner (Germany) and Pratiba Parmar (UK).

The problem is, you don't want to just put the scenes of violence up there on
the big screen in a realistic manner, for that very act runs the risk of
inviting identification with the perpetrators of the violence--just what you
don't want to do. I'm sure you've all heard the horror stories of young male
moviegoers cheering on the rapists in "The Accused." And I long ago stopped
showing "Not a Love Story" to my classes because the guys in the a/v crew were
vying with one another to get that assignment so they could see the dirty
pictures.

I'm not exactly pleased the results of my thinking on this subject, but that
didn't stop me from giving a paper on it at a conference.  It's kind of a first
baby step in an interesting direction. It has recently appeared in a
collection of pieces from the conference. The paper is called, "Feminist
Cinematic Depictions of Violence Against Women: An Analysis of Three
Representational Strategies." It's in KRIEG/WAR, Munich: Wilhelm Fink Verlag,
1997. I have some reprints I'd be happy to send out as long as they last.

Subject:      A cautionary tale
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

This is not related to women's studies but I thought it would be valuable
information for members of this list.

I returned to my office after Labor Day to find that my computer wasn't working.
After some investigation, we found that a lightning and thunder storm had
hit four buildings on our campus leaving a trail of computer havoc: I lost my
motherboard, video card and modem. The chair of my department lost his whole
unit, and another colleague lost his printer as well as his entire unit.
One of the other buildings lost its entire Ethernet network. All of us had
our computers on surge protectors. I thought that my $20 surge protector was
enough.  It wasn't. Apparently, surge protectors are of little value when a
building takes a direct hit. As you can imagine, we are lucky to be
self-insured for this kind of a disaster.

Since I had, in the past, backed my files up on small floppy disks only to
find that they went bad after a while, I had not backed up most of my files
pending the purchase of a zip drive.  Luckily for me, my hard drive was not
affected but I need a new computer since it would cost too much to repair it
and taking the obsolesence factor into consideration, it would not be worth
it.  Since, however, we are a state institution, they are only putting out
the request for bids tomorrow, so I have been teaching without my files and
may not have a new computer until the new year.

The technician who diagnosed my computer made these suggestions and I pass
them on to you.
1) Back up all your files NOW.
2) Buy a GOOD surge protector (it may cost you $150) that has outlets for
the telephone wires.  My machine was damaged by a surge that came through
the phone wires.
3) During the lightning season (summer, autumn) disconnect the whole thing
when you leave the office.
4) Be particularly careful with your equipment at home. While the electrical
systems in more modern office buildings may be equipped to deal with such an
event, most homes are not. The tech told us he sees dozens of cases like
this every year, especially in homes.

Jennifer,

I am a graduate student at Iowa State University and a member of the
advisory board to our Women's Center.  The Center is fifteen years old.
I am not sure how it got started, but your question makes me wonder.  Our
next meet in October 9; I will ask other board members at the meeting,
and also ask for suggestions members may have about getting started.

I will keep your message on file and e-mail you back at that time.

Meanwhile, good luck getting started!

Hi there, in relation to recent postings on women's centers:

I am a graduate student in college student personnel w/ an assignment to
compare two campuses for their work in particular areas, and my areas are
women's centers and multicultural centers. I am just beginning to look for
women's centers/multicultural centers in the Maryland, DC, and Virginia
area, and would appreciate any information as to centers in this area.

Furthermore, I may not have much luck finding local centers, and would
also appreciate any information that could be provided about centers
around the country (ie, web sites, copies of proposals, fact sheets,
descriptions) I could pay for a small amount of postage, by sending
self-addressed stamped manila envelopes to folks w/info.

Thank you VERY MUCH for any help you could provide.

    Hi.  In response to those people interested in obtaining information
about women's centers, a more appropriate place to post such queries may be
WRAC-L, a list for women's resource and action centers.  To join, send the
message SUBSCRIBE WRAC-L Your Name (e.g., SUBSCRIBE WRAC-L Jane Doe) to
LISTSERV@DARTMOUTH.EDU .  Please hold discussions about women's centers
(and send queries about women's centers) there.  I'm not sure, but it's
possible that you can obtain more info about WRAC-L by sending the message
INFO WRAC-L to the above address.

        Many thanks.

I was wondering if other women's studies programs or schools had encountered
transport issues with disabled faculty, staff, students--and how transport
needs were met.  My university formerly provided disabled folks
transportation between buildings via security cars.  Now, because of a
reorganization, security is no longer responsible for such services, but no
one has provided a reasonable alternative.  (The Human Resources VP
suggested that I take a cab--for 3 blocks, in Chicago.)  How does your
school handle transport for the disabled?  Was your Women's Studies Program
involved?  I'd be most grateful for any information.

PLEASE reply privately; I know Joan won't want this cluttering up the list.

I have noticed discussion of TAke Back the Night.  The student feminist group
on our campus is organizing a forum on the history of TAke Back the Night and
needs help.  Does anyone know of anything written on the history, or does
anyone have that history to share?

Please post privately or to the list.

Thanks,

        Please, folks, we just finished a round of messages about Take Back
the Night, including some that addressed the question of its history.
Let's not start yet another round.  To make it easy for you to find some of
the many past discussions of this topic, I've added two files to the WMST-L
filelist: TAKEBACK NIGHT1 and TAKEBACK NIGHT2.  The first includes messages
from 1995; the second covers the very recent discussion (Sept. 1997).  To
get these files, send the following two-line message to
LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU:

        GET TAKEBACK NIGHT1
        GET TAKEBACK NIGHT2

        If you'd like to see what other files are available, add a third
line that includes just the two words INDEX WMST-L .  Be sure to send your
message to LISTSERV@UMDD.UMD.EDU, **not** to WMST-L.  More information
about the file collection can be found in the Source of All Wisdom, the
WMST-L User's Guide (http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/user-guide.html).

        And if you'd like to learn how to search the logfiles for yourself
(that's what I did to find the "Take Back the Night" messages), you can
send for instructions.  If you add the line GET SEARCH LOGFILES, you'll get
the instructions I learned from; if you'd prefer a simplified procedure,
you'll find it described at http://www.umbc.edu/wmst/simplesearch.html .
