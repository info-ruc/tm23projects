          CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

          CADE-14 WORKSHOP ON

          STRATEGIES IN AUTOMATED DEDUCTION
          =================================

          July 13, 1997
          Townsville, Australia
          http://www.loria.fr/~gramlich/cade14-ws-strategies.html



MOTIVATIONS

The concept of strategy allows describing and guiding
computations and deductions in automated theorem provers,
proof checkers, logical frameworks.

Strategies are used for various purposes, e.g.:
- proof search in  theorem proving,
- combination of different proof techniques and computation paradigms,
- program transformation,
- development of heuristics for playing games and finding proofs.

Deterministic computations or inference rule based deductions are not
sufficient to capture every computation or proof development.  A
mechanism is needed for instance to formalise the search for different
solutions, the check of context conditions, the request for user input
to instantiate variables, the processing of subgoals in a particular
order.  Strategies are used to guide application of rules, but may
also involve iteration, case analysis, deterministic and
non-deterministic choices. One may want to program strategies, to
transform them, to prove some property on the computations or the
proofs that they describe.


AIMS

The workshop aims at gathering different experiences on
the use of strategies, under various terminology
(tactic, tactical, method, heuristic, proof planning...),
and in various application domains
(first-order, higher-order, inductive theorem proving,
program transformation, operational semantics...).
Based on these experiments, we will address and discuss
several points:

- Strategy languages:
Which basic constructs are needed?
Expressiveness versus efficiency?
Meta-language versus reflexivity?
Higher-order versus first-order syntax?

- Computational models for proof systems with strategies:
Architecture, modularity of such systems?
How to deal with user-interaction, input-output?

- Verification of strategies:
Which properties are required for strategies?
Fairness, (partial) completeness, termination, etc.?
How to ensure and/or check them?


SUBMISSIONS

Participants interested in presenting their work are invited to send
an extended abstract (5-10 pages) by e-mail
submission of a postscript file to the organizers
(strategy@loria.fr) before April 21, 1997.

Participants interested in attending the workshop without giving
a presentation should send a position paper (1-2 pages)
mentioning interest in one or several aspects of the topics.

Additional information will be available through
http://www.loria.fr/~gramlich/cade14-ws-strategies.html

Attendance is by invitation only. Workshop registration is to be done
as part of registration of CADE-14. The early registration deadline
for CADE-14 is May 12, 1997.
