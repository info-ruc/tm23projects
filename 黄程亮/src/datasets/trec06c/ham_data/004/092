                          CALL FOR PAPERS

                 4th  International Colloquium on
        Structural Information and Communication Complexity

                           (SIROCCO '97)


                Monte Verita', Ascona, Switzerland
                         July  24-26, 1997



The 4th Colloquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity
will focus on the relationship between computing and communication, i.e.,
the study of those factors which are significant for the computability and
the communication complexity of problems, and on the interplay between
structure, knowledge and complexity in systems of communicating agents.

The Colloquium is designed to bring together researchers interested in
the fundamental principles underlying all computing through communication.
It will be held at the Centro Stefano Franscini on Monte Verita' in the
Italian-speaking part of Switzerland; Ascona is a lakeside resort in an
alpine setting.


Original papers are solicited on the interplay between structure
(e.g., topology), knowledge and complexity in:

- distributed computing
- parallel  computing
- mobile computing
- optical computing
- interconnection networks
- wireless  networks
- high-speed networks


Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

* sense of direction
* routing schemes
* topological awareness and metric information
* network topologies
* structural properties and computability
* topology-dependent communication, broadcasting and gossiping
* complexity of constructing and maintaining structural information
* communication complexity
* models of communication

The colloquium will comprise of position papers (outlining open problems,
research directions, etc.), tutorials, and research papers.

Electronic submissions consisting of a readable postscript file are strongly
encouraged and should be sent to sirocco@scs.carleton.ca.  (More information
on electronic submission is available at the colloquium's web site:
http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~sirocco.)

For paper submissions authors should send 12 copies of an extended abstract
of at most 15 pages, clearly indicating the type of submission (position,
tutorial, research), to:

                              SIROCCO '97
                          Carleton University
                       School of Computer Science
                        Ottawa, Ontario  K1S 5B6
                                Canada

The deadline for submission of papers is  April 25.

Authors will be notified regarding the acceptance of their papers by
electronic mail by  May 31.  Authors should include their electronic
address.

Accepted abstracts will be distributed as a collection of colloquium
papers available during the conference.  The official proceedings will
be published by Carleton Scientific  and will be mailed to the
participants afterwards.
