 ACCOMMODATION

Please note that the Canadian Olympic Training Regatta 
(CORK) will be held in Kingston from August 11 to 
August 24.  This event draws thousands of visitors to 
the city and hotel rooms are consequently in great 
demand at that time.  Reservations are STRONGLY 
ADVISED. CCCG '97 has arranged for a total of one 
hundred rooms in the conference hotels and residence, 
but these rooms will be released if not reserved by 
July 11.  Quoted rates are in Canadian funds and do not 
include taxes.

The principal residence for the Conference will be the 
Victoria Hall student residence (Queen's Crescent).  50 
rooms have been reserved.

For those who prefer hotel accommodation, 25 rooms have 
been reserved at the Ramada Inn.  As well, a few rooms 
have been reserved in two of Kingston's bed & breakfast 
inns.  These rooms will be released on July 12, if not 
taken up by then.  Please state that you are part of 
the CCCG'97 conference when reserving your rooms.  Some 
other hotels are also listed below for your 
convenience.

Quoted rates are in Canadian funds (currently a 
Canadian dollar is worth about 0.75 U.S. dollars) and 
do not include taxes unless otherwise stated.

Conference participants should contact residence or 
hotels directly, not through the Conference 
secretariat.  If parking is 
required, please specify with your Victoria Hall 
reservation.

Canadian dollars drawn on a Canadian bank
or by international money order or bank 
draft, which must be for Canadian dollars drawn on a 
Canadian bank.  Cheques in other currencies cannot be

during the currency conversion process.  Cheques and 
money orders should be made payable to Queen's 
University/CCCG'97.  Fees are refundable, minus a $30 
cancellation charge, provided a written request is 
received by the Conference Office no later than August 4,

After the workshop begins registration and information 
will be available at the technical session site in 
Walter Light Hall.

The full registration fee includes a copy of the workshop proceedings,
refreshments, the welcoming reception, admission to all invited talks
and technical sessions and the conference banquet. A student
registration fee is available which includes all items mentioned except
the banquet. (Student registrations must be signed by the student's
supervisor.) The one day registration fee includes neither a copy of
the proceedings, nor a banquet ticket. Accompanying persons are
welcome to attend all social functions. Additional banquet tickets may
be purchased in advance or at the conference. Refunds for banquet
tickets cannot be made after August 4, 1997.
