`Old Fashioned' Window Manager
- small executable
- synchronous, predictable behaviour
- user interface based on simple, consistent design rules
- responsive to user
- works `out of the box'

`Modern' Window Manager
- huge executable
- asynchronous, unpredictable behaviour
- user interface based on whims of marketing division
- machine thrashes every time user moves mouse
- billions of configuration options that need to be set before
   it is even remotely usable

There's no accounting for taste ;-)

P.S.  Curiously, this is just as true if we replace `Window Manager'
with `Web Browser'...
