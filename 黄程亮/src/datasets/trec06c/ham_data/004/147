implementation of databases are solicited. Papers emphasizing new topics or
foundations of emerging areas are especially welcomed.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

Suggested topics include the following: (this list is not exclusive)

access methods and physical design; active databases; complexity and
performance evaluation; concurrency control; constraint databases; data
integration and interoperability; data mining; data models; database
programming languages; database updates; databases on Internet and Intranet;
deductive databases and knowledge bases; distributed databases; heterogeneous
databases; integrity and security; logic in databases; multimedia databases;
object-oriented databases; OLAP; query languages; real-time databases;
semi-structured data; spatial and temporal databases; transaction management;

PAPER SUBMISSION

Submissions of extended abstracts can be sent, in twelve copies, to one of
the following two addresses, to be received before the deadline of
17 November 1997:

Fax: +32-3-8202421

No electronic submissions will be taken.

The address, telephone number, FAX number, and e-mail address of the contact
author should be given on the title page of the submission.  A limit of 10
pages is placed on submissions. Font size should be at least 10 points. The
abstract must provide sufficient detail to allow the program committee to
assess its merits and should include appropriate references to and
comparisons with the literature. Each submission should begin with a succinct
statement of the problem a summary of the main results, and a brief
explanation of their significance and relevance to the conference, all suited
for the non-specialist. Technical development of the work, directed to the
specialist, should follow. If the authors believe more details are necessary
to substantiate the main claims of the paper, they may include a clearly
marked appendix to be read at the discretion of the committee.

BEST NEWCOMER AWARD

An award will be given to the best submission, as judged by the program
committee, written solely by authors who have never published in earlier PODS
proceedings.

BEST PAPER AWARD

There will also be an award for the best of all papers submitted, as judged
by the program committee.

The program committee reserves the right to give both awards to the same
paper, not to give an award, or to split an award among several papers.
Papers authored or co-authored by program committee members are not eligible
for an award.
