Hi Folks,

I updated the xrcf data archive on /starburst for MIT/ASC:

all ACIS-2C and HST data are on /starburst/d2 

aqlc1 and aqlc2 are the ACIS-2C data that already existed before

PHASE_G         are all ACIS-2C data from the mid-April run

PHASE_H         are all ACIS HST data from the ACIS flight testing

PHASE_Hr        are the reprocessed phase H HST data (updated as
                reprocessing continues)

all ACIS flight telemetry data are on /starburst/d3

mcc1 - 4        currently contain erv-/arv-/.qdp formatted telemetry
                data of all the science runs in phase H. Currently
                the runs are NOT yet broken up into single test IDs.

During time I will try to break all the science runs into single
test IDs and have the arv-format converted into the L1-output format.
Since this is a short cut to overcome the tele-decom problems at SAO
for the time being, we may not do this conversion for all data sets
but the ones of immediate interest. I can't promise any time scale
to get the conversion done, but in case there is immediate need to
look at telemetry data, I will find a way to look at them at request.
Joel also knows, how to deal with arv-formats. 

have fun,
Norbert
