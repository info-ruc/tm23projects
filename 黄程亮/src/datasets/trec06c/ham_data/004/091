                            CALL FOR PAPERS

            CATS'98 - Computing: The Australasian Theory Symposium

                    University of Western Australia
                       Perth, Western Australia
                          2-3 February, 1998

CATS'98 will be held at the University of Western Australia as part of the
Australasian Computer Science Week (ACSW98) which also includes:
        .  the Australasian Computer Science Conference (ACSC'98)
        .  the Australasian Database Conference (ADC'98)
        .  the Australasian Computer Architecture Conference (ACAC'98)

Following on from CATS'94 in Sydney, CATS'96 in Melbourne, and CATS'97 in
Sydney, CATS'98 aims at providing a forum for researchers in theoretical
computer science. Typical, but not exclusive, topics of interest include:

- - Algorithms and data structure
- - Category theory
- - Complexity
- - Computational algebra, biology, geometry, logic, and number theory
- - Concurrency
- - Distributed and parallel computing
- - Formal semantics, specification, synthesis, and verification

Original research papers are solicited. Submissions to CATS'98 this year will
be again conducted electronically, and should be sent in standard Postscript
format to cats98@cs.uwa.edu.au by the submission deadline. Authors unable to
access e-mail may send 4 hard copies of their papers to

                Xuemin Lin -- CATS'98
                Department of Computer Science
                University of Western Australia
                Crawley, Western Australia 6907
                Australia
                E-mail: cats98@cs.uwa.edu.au
                http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au:80/~lxue/CATS98/index.html

In both cases, confirmation of receipt will be given, in the case of a
postscript submission, once the file has been successfully printed.

Submissions should include an abstract, 3-6 key words, and the fax number
and e-mail address of the corresponding author. The contribution of the paper
should be clearly explained in both general and technical terms, and authors
should make every effort to ensure the technical content of their papers is
understandable by a broad audience. The paper (an extended abstract or full
paper) should not exceed 15 A4 pages using 11 point or larger font.
Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the
paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the conference to
present the work.

Papers will be judged on originality, significance, correctness, and clarity.
Accepted papers will be published in the proceedings of the Symposium, which
will appear in the DMTCS series of Springer-Verlag.
