                             Call for Papers

                     24rd International Workshop on

           Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer Science (WG '98)

         Smolenice-Castle (close to Bratislava), June 18 - 20, 1998


The International Workshop on Graph-Theoretic Concepts in Computer
Science is one of the most traditional and high quality conferences
in Computer Science. Previous conferences were organized at various places
in Austria, Germany, Italy and in the Netherlands.
For the first time in its history WG is going to take place in one of the former
socialist countries in the Central Europe - Slovak Republic.
The workshop aims at uniting theory and practice by demonstrating how
graph-theoretic concepts can be applied to various areas in Computer
science, or by extracting new problems from applications.  The goal is
to present recent research results and to identify and explore
directions of future research.  The workshop is well-balanced
w.r.t. established researchers and young scientists. For many years
now, the proceedings have been published in the LNCS series of
Springer-Verlag.

TOPICS
======
Papers are solicited describing original results on all aspects of
graph-theoretic concepts in computer science, e.g. structural graph
theory, sequential, parallel, and distributed graph and network
algorithms and their complexity, graph grammars and graph rewriting
systems, graph-based modeling, graph-drawing and layout, diagram
methods, and support of these concepts by suitable implementations.
Prospective authors are encouraged to send papers from
various application areas like Internet, Web, ATM, mobile radio networks,
data structures, data bases, programming languages, tools for software
construction, communications, concurrency, computer architectures,
VLSI, artificial intelligence, graphics, CAD, operations research, or
pattern recognition.

FURTHER INFORMATION
===================

The WG'98 conference will take place at the Smolenice Castle, Slovakia.
Further information (a picture of Smolenice Castle too)
can be found at the URL: http://ifi.savba.sk/wg98.

Smolenice Castle lies approximately 50 km to the  north  from Bratislava.
Smolenice had been a Slavonic settlement from the 8 - 12th centuries.  A  large
settlement from the Halstadt period (6-7th centuries B.C.) has  been  found  at
the Mount Molpir. The Smolenice Castle has been originated as a stronghold near
the passes through the Small Carpathians. Only a ruin in the beginning  of  the
19th century, it was reconstructed by  Count  Palffy  in  this  century.  As  a
secessionist building, it was completed after the year  1945.  The  castle
serves to the purposes of Slovak Academy of Sciences nowadays.

Weather
June weather in Smolenice is usually nice, with temperatures about 15-20 degrees
centigrade.

Visa
No visa is required for citizens of most European countries. In case of  doubt,
information can be obtained from the Slovak embassy or consulate.

Travel
By car - Smolenice is 50 km to the north from Bratislava. From Bratislava take
direction Jur, Pezinok, Modra, Oresany, Smolenice.
By plane - you can take a plane to either Bratislava airport or to
Vienna (Schwechat) airport. There is a regular bus connection from Schwechat
