DMDX 3.1.5.0 adds the <bb2mr> keyword:

Branch Backwards to Most Recent Keyword

<BB2MR [N]>

     MDSP bit 10000000 modifier, backwards branches go to the most recent 
occurrence of an item number instead of the first.

    Without BB2MR branching backwards in DMDX is rather crude, you can only 
branch backwards to the first occurrence in the itemfile (as opposed to the 
most recent occurrence) of item number N because originally DMTG could not 
parse an item file backwards. The BB2MR option that overrides this.  When 
branching forwards if DMDX doesn't find an item number after a branch 
keyword item it will branch to the first occurrence of that item number in 
the item file unless BB2MR is on in which case it will branch to the most 
recent occurrence of the item number.  When a negative item number is used 
as a branch destination (and almost all times BB2MR is useful you'll be 
using a negative item destination) it will also branch backwards to the 
most recent occurrence of that item.  The is handy for repeating an item 
conditionally without having to code each item number in dozens of little 
branch items.  For instance we have a paradigm where the subject is allowed 
to check the time for instance as well as respond to the item.  After 
checking the time the item should be presented again.  This can either be 
done by putting the item number into the <multiwaybranch> or by sticking a 
stub item before the RT gathering item and branching back to it so every RT 
gathering group of items can have the same structure.  Here a, b and c are 
responses and F7 and F8 display auxiliary information and F10 displays the 
time (with a bit of futzing around to get a leading zero on the seconds 
when needed):

<s 8> <g 8> <zil> <zor> <cr>

~1;
+101 "First Question" * <mwb +a,9 +b,9 +c,9 +F7,7, +F8,8, +F10,4 binr,9> ;
~4 <set c1=millisectime/1000> <set c2=c1/60> <set c3=c1%60> <bi 6, c3 .lt. 10>;
5 <px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":" <apc 3> / <bu -1>;
6 <px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":0" <apc 3> / <bu -1>;
7 "F7 info" <bu -1>;
8 "F8 info" <bu -1>;
~9;

~1;
+102 "Second Question" * <mwb +a,9 +b,9 +c,9 +F7,7, +F8,8, +F10,4 binr,9> ;
~4 <set c1=millisectime/1000> <set c2=c1/60> <set c3=c1%60> <bi 6, c3 .lt. 10>;
5 <px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":" <apc 3> / <bu -1>;
6 <px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":0" <apc 3> / <bu -1>;
7 "F7 info" <bu -1>;
8 "F8 info" <bu -1>;
~9;
~1;
+103 "Third Question" * <mwb +a,9 +b,9 +c,9 +F7,7, +F8,8, +F10,4 binr,9> ;
~4 <set c1=millisectime/1000> <set c2=c1/60> <set c3=c1%60> <bi 6, c3 .lt. 10>;
5 <px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":" <apc 3> / <bu -1>;
6 <px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":0" <apc 3> / <bu -1>;
7 "F7 info" <bu -1>;
8 "F8 info" <bu -1>;
~9;

     Note that without the -1 destination it wouldn't work as it would go 
on to the next item and without BB2MR all the -1s would have to be the 
individual item number for that group, 101, 102 or 103 in our example.  And 
because we've now got uniform branched we could replace most of that text 
with macros:

<s 8> <g 8> <zil> <zor> <cr>
$~999 mu+* <mwb +a,9 +b,9 +c,9 +F7,7, +F8,8, +F10,4 binr,9>+
       mv+<set c1=millisectime/1000> <set c2=c1/60> <set c3=c1%60> <bi 6, 
c3 .lt. 10>+
       mw+<px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":" <apc 3> / <bu -1>+
       mx+<px .48> "" <apc 2>, ":0" <apc 3> / <bu -1>+
       mx+"F7 info" <bu -1>+
       mz+"F8 info" <bu -1>+;$
