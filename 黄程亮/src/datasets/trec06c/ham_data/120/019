               to          CX DG's               from    Lewis L Smith

Complexity has brought disparate sciences together and promoted a healthy=20=
=E2=80=9C
cross fertilization=E2=80=9D among disciplines. For example, concepts and me=
taphors from=20
biology are  beginning to influence economics, so that complexity economists=

ke=20
a collection of 19th Century steam engines with their self-regulating=20
devices, a metaphor which once inspired so many in my field, even when they=20=
didn=E2=80=99t=20
realize it. Among other consequences, this contact has encouraged some=20
economists to try to apply Darwinian notions of evolution to economics.=20

However, starting from my experience with malaria mosquitoes in 1959-61, I=20
have come to suspect that much of the evolution since WW II has been far fas=
ter=20
and =E2=80=9Csmarter=E2=80=9D than anything Darwin ever conceived of and tha=
t its process is=20
rather different from the one which he envisaged. There are many examples=20
which one could cite, but HIV is a classic one that surely clinches the poin=
t. C
uriously this =E2=80=9Cin your face=E2=80=9D type of evolution, which often=20=
kills or sickens=20
people, has been largely omitted from the Creation/Evolution debate, even th=
ough=20
it is a stunning repudiation of the Creationist nonsense.

Recently a new example came to my attention, and I pass it on for your=20
perusal. This sort of thing is puzzling because I cant recall anything analo=
gous in=20
Origins or in economics. What is going on here ?   Can economists learn=20
anything from it ?

A recent study in the Annals of Internal Medicine points to the sudden=20
appearance of aa new strain of treatment-resistant staph bacteria and sugges=
ts that=20
it may be =E2=80=9Cthe primary cause of skin infections outside the hospital=

study recommends that healthcare personnel switch their treatment regime fro=
m=20
penicillin to vancomycin . However, it also warns that strains of bacteria=20
resistant to vancomycin are already emerging in hospitals !   [Business Week=
, O3=20
Apr O6, p. 113.]

While [safely in the bosom of =E2=80=9Cthe family=E2=80=9D] we are daring to=
 question=20
Darwin, a recent issue of  Science, the weekly of the American Association f=

e=20
that NSA doesn=E2=80=99t pass this on to the Rev. Pat Robertson.]

Roughgarden et al [p. 965] have proposed a model of sexual selection based o=
n=20

alternative to Darwin=E2=80=99s explanation which the authors claim, contrad=

Their hypothesis is that groups which succeed in cooperating may have greate=
r=20
fitness than those which fail to do so.   [Science, 17 Feb 2006, p. 913. <=20
