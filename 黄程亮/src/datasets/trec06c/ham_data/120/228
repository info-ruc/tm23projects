Overcast builds an overlay network out of dedicated hosts placed at 
strategic locations. Hosts self-organize themselves into a distribution 
tree rooted at the source. Clients request content via a HTTP request to 
the root. The root selects the most appropriate leaf node and redirects 
the client to it.

Link choices are optimized for bandwidth. The tree is generated by 
maximizing the bandwidth from the candidate node to the root, placing it 
as deep as possible, without sacrificing bandwidth to the source. This 
is done by starting at the root and recursively  probing the available 
bandwidth to the current node directly and through each of its children. 
Bandwidth is measured by determining the download time of 10 Kbytes.     

Nodes periodically reevaluate their position in the tree by measuring 
bandwidth to its siblings, parent and grandparent and make decisions 
based on the same logic. This periodic check allow the tree to adapt to 
the changing network conditions and serves as a failure recovery 
mechanism for non-root nodes. In addition, each node periodically 
reports statistical information up to the root, to facilitate client 
redirection decisions.

The paper makes an interesting point about streaming content delivery. 
With an IP multicast infrastructure, clients can only receive packets in 
real time. However, in ALM nodes can leverage the availability of 
storage in the overlay by serving non-real time client requests .

Overcast is a simple protocol for ALM that is designed to will work well 
in a dedicate infrastructure environment (it is not designed to handle 
high churn, to quickly recover from failure, etc). If applied for as a 
peer-to-peer solutions, it will be unfair towards inner nodes in the 
tree compared to leaf nodes.

A deep tree may incur higher latencies, but in a video streaming 
environment a delay of several seconds is generally not considered an issue.
