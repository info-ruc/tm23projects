This paper presents a mathematical model for the behavior of a
BitTorrent network.  Their model explains several features of the
BitTorrent network.  In their model, the average downloading time is
independent of the request arrival rate, which explains why BitTorrent
can handle flash crowds.  The average downloading time is related to
both the effectiveness of the file sharing, and then rate at which
seeds leave the system.  They go on to present a model for the
effectiveness of filesharing in BitTorrent, and argue that it will
always be fairly close to 1.  Their analysis of the incentive
mechanism in BitTorrent suggests that in a reasonably large network, a
freeloading peer will get about 20% of the download bandwidth a
well-behaved peer receives.

The comparison of the predicted behavior of a BitTorrent network under
this model, and an actual BitTorrent network, is extremely limited.
Most of the comparison is done between their model and a simulated
BitTorrent network.  While the general trends in these simulations
match up with the model, the simulations have some large oscillations
which the model does not predict.  The lack of error bars for the
simulation data makes it difficult to determine if this is caused by
random variation within the simulations, or if the model is failing to
predict some behavior.  The larger the arrival rate of new requests
is, the more accurate the model appears to be.

At the end, there is a comparison to the behavior of an actual
BitTorrent network.  However, the limited popularity of this file
makes it difficult to draw any conclusions about the accuracy of the
model.  While the evolution of the number of seeds and number of
downloaders is within the 95% confidence interval, that interval is
rather large, especially for the number of downloaders.  While having
a model of the behavior of BitTorrent would be useful, I'm not
convinced that the model presented here will accurately predict the
behavior of real BitTorrent networks.
