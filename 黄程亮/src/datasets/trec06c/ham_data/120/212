Overcast: Reliable Multicasting with an Overlay Network
John Jannotti, David K. Gifford, Kirk L. Johnson, M. Frans Kaashoek, James
W. O'Toole Jr.

Slightly showing its age, Overcast is an unsophisticated system that belies
considerable power, allowing single transmitter broadcast of arbitrary
information through an overlay network. The insight is that it is quite
likely that transmitter bandwidth and later nodes' bandwidth are somewhat
unrelated; in specific, there exist optimal topologies to perform this
distribution. The additions are that it uses permanent storage to boost
existing network performance, a simple protocol for forming efficient and
scalable distribution trees that adapt to changes in the conditions of the
substrate network, a novel protocol for maintaining global status at the
root of a changing distribution tree, for quick joins, and to do it all
efficiently. Attention is given to deployability, with many choices for the
algorithm decided by the actual behavior of firewalls and NATs, using HTTP
TCP to perform its activities (for maximum applicability). Joining the
network consists of contacting a node already in the distribution tree and
then modifying to maintain maximal bandwidth to the root; starting at the
root, the node will try to locate itself further from the root based on
bandwidth through current and through each of current's children, for
current beginning at the root, and breaking ties with number of substrate
hops (via traceroute). To keep track of remote events, there are periodic
heartbeats sent, which include update information from the child to the
parent. To alleviate the burden on the root, some requests are redirected
via DNS name of the root resolving to multiple addresses and to improve
crash performance, there are multiple copies of the root maintained (linear
children).
The flaws of this paper are due to age, not the paper itself; it's clear
that the behavior of the multicast tree is passed by systems such as Bullet
and SplitStream, to name a few. However, as a first stab, the system is
quite scalable, though suffering from scalability problems at the root
itself, and reasonably efficient. The experimental data support the thesis
of the paper, but moreover, the attempts made at tree reassembly and
self-assembly are sufficiently advanced to be recognized as an acheivement.
The choice of protocol medium is ingenious, allowing easy integration of
existing technologies, and the attention to implementability, though
accompanying the reminder of lack of actual implementation, is well
appreciated.
