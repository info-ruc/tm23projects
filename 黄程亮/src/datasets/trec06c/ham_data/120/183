Qiu and Srikant present an analysis of BitTorrent like networks in
"Modeling and Performance Analysis of BitTorrent-Like Peer-to-Peer
Networks".  "BitTorrent like networks" means that files are divided into
chunks which are downloaded from seeds.  Additionally downloaders can
download chunks from each other even if they don't have the entire file.
Qiu and Srikant develop a model to explore peer evolution, scalability,
file sharing efficiency and incentives to participate.  This is a fluid
model which captures the number of seeds, downloaders, arrival rate of
downloaders, uploading and downloading bandwidth, rate at which
downloaders and seeds leave the system.

An important aspect of the system is the efficiency which is characterized
by eta ranging from 0 to 1.  At eta=0 downloaders do not upload.  At eta=1
all downloaders are uploading to each other.  This is an important aspect
because this is an important contribution of BitTorrent: that downloaders
are able to improve system performance because they can be uploaders as
they download the files.  Qiu and Srikant show that in BitTorrent, if all
peers follow the protocol, eta approaches 1 with N and the number of
uploading connections.  The model is also used to show that the uploading
bandwidth of the system grows with the number of downloaders and in fact
the download bandwidth of each peer is independent of the number of
downloaders and so the system is very scalable.  Another important
contribution of the paper is an analysis of the Nash equilibrium of agents
in such a system.  In fact, if optimistic unchoking is ignored, each peer
would upload as much as possible in order to maximize downloading (due to
incentives in the BitTorrent protocol).  However, optimistic unchoking
could lead to free-riders (since it allows peers to download without
uploading), but further analysis shows that this will only utilize a
fraction (small given BitTorrent parameters) of the bandwidth possible if
peers do upload.  This analysis suggests that BitTorrent is efficient,
scalable and provides good incentives for participation (if maximizing
download bandwidth is more important than minimizing upload bandwidth).

Simulation shows that in many cases the model accurately characterizes the
number of seeds and downloaders (for large downloader arrival rates).  An
analysis of a real trace shows that some significant deviation from the
model exists.  Qiu and Srikant argue that this deviation is within
expected 95% confidence intervals from the predicted values of number of
seeds and downloaders.  Further, they argue that the file they considered
was unpopular and therefore did not exhibit high enough downloder arrival
rates to fit the model well.  Qiu and Srikant also note that while they
characterized downloader arrival and seed departure by poisson processes,
a constant parameter for these distributions was not observed in a real
trace.
