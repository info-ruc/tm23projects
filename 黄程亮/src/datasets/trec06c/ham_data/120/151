>  Modeling and Performance Analysis of BitTorrent-Like Peer-to-Peer Networks
> This paper develop a simple fluid model to study the performance, scalability, performance and efficiency of Bit Torrent, a file-sharing mechanism of a second generation peer-to-peer (P2P) application. A numerical analysis is performed and numerical results based on both simulations and real traces obtained from the Internet are provided.  In more specificity the number of peers in the system and its effect in bit torrent along with the scalability, file sharing efficiency when upload and download speeds are different and the incentives for free riding. The authors develop a develop a simple deterministic model to obtain simple expressions for the average file-transfer time, thus providing insight into the performance of the P2P network with  realistic scenarios in the fluid model such as the abandonment of file transfers by peers and download bandwidth constraints and a simple stochastic fluid model which characterizes the variability of the number of peer around the equilibrium values predicted by the deterministic fluid model. This paper obtains expressions for the average number of seeds, the average number of downloader, and the average downloading time as functions of the peer arrival rate, downloader leaving rate, seed leaving rate, uploading bandwidth, etc, which explicitly give us insight on how the network performance is affected by different parameters. This paper also characterized the variability of the system by applying limit theorems to the stochastic model when the arrival rate is large. This paper also discusses the effect of optimistic unchoking on free-riding and how the simple fluid model can capture the behavior of the system even when the arrival rate is small.
