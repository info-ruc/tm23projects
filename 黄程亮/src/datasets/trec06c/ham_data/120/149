This paper presents a fluid model to study the scalability, performance and efficiency of BitTorrent-like systems and discusses the incentive mechanism in BitTorrent to discourage free-riders.

* The fluid model in this paper expresses the average number of seeds (nodes that have all pieces of files for others' downloads), average number of downloaders, and average download time as functions of downloader arrival/leaving rates, upload/download bandwidths and seed leaving rates.
* It shows that: (a) the download time is irrelevant to peer arrival rates, thus the system is scalable; (b) the download time increases if many seeds leave the system; (c) the download bandwidth is no longer the bottleneck of the download time if it's large enough.
* It then shows that the effectiveness (uploading files to others) of downloaders play an important role to keep the system alive. As long as downloaders upload/share files (even though only a few) with others, the system will eventually reach a steady state.
* It also shows that the effectiveness g (which takes values in [0, 1]) is very close to 1 in BitTorrent. Because the value of g is relevant to k, the number of peers a downloader connects to, which in turn is related to the peer arrival rates, this paper concludes that the performance of BitTorrent improves as the size of the system increases.
* It finally shows that, affected by the peer selection rules, each peer chooses its uploading bandwidth equal to the actual uploading bandwidth; that is, Nash equilibrium exists. 

<Issue> This paper shows the effect of optimistic choking on free-riders: free-riders gets an average download rate in inverse proportion to n+1, where n is the number of a peer's uploads (4 in current BitTorrent; in this case, download rate of a free-rider is about 20%). To decide an optimal n to balance system performance with deterrence of free-riders is an open issue.
