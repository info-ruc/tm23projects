Stan, thank you for your reply!

The firing intensity of nodes refers to a characteristic of the nodes. 
Now suppose we just look at a causal sequence of linked nodes. Is it 
possible for such a temporal sequence to be a hierarchy on basis of the 
causal sequence?

For example, a system consists of inputs, processes, and outputs. This 
is a temporal sequence since they are linked in a causal manner. On the 
one hand, you could argue that there is a hierarchy because you NEED 
inputs before processes and therefore processes are higher in hierarchy 
than inputs. On the other hand, it is not so obvious that one is higher 
in hierarchy than another, which suggests this sequence of events is not 
a hierarchy. Therefore, could you say that processes are higher in 
hierarchy than inputs and outputs are higher in hierarchy than 
processes? Or is this simply a temporal sequence that has nothing to do 
with a hierarchy?
