I have a new email address!You can now email me at: gbeale55@yahoo.co.uk

Good day


I am writing to seek your cooperation over a business deal. I am a top executive in one of the leading the banks in the United Kingdom. In my department, I discovered an unclaimed sum of £15,500,000 (Fifteen million, Five Hundred Thousand british Pounds), in an account that belongs to one of our poreign customers who died along with his entire family in a plane crash that took place in Kenya, East Africa. Thw late Dr. George Brumley, a citizen of Atlanta, United States of America but resident here in London, United Kingdom, until his death was my personal physician. See weblink (http://www.cnsnews.com/viewprint.asp?page=\nation\archive\200307\nat20030721d.html).


Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his "Next of Kin" to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately, all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the plane crash having nobody behind to claim the money.


The banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transferred into the Bank Treasury as unclaimed fund. The request for your assistance and maximum co-operation as a foreign citizen to stand as the Next of Kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner.Therefore,your utmost confidentiality in this deal is required.


If this interests you,kindly forward your tel,fax and email address to me for the way forward as regards the consumation of this deal.                                   

I await your immediate response.


Sincerely Yours,



- Graham Beale
