Overcast uses an overlay network to provide single-source multicast.
In Overcast, nodes which wish to subscribe to some multicast channel
self-organize into a content distribution tree, with node providing
the data source at the root.  Because it has a more limited focus than
Narada or yoid, Overcast can eliminate some of the overhead those
protocols require.

Overcast attempts to maximize the bandwidth between nodes.  Individual
nodes join as children of the root, and then attempt to move as far
down the tree as possible without sacrificing bandwidth.  Nodes
periodically re-evaluate their place in the network, and move around
as needed.  In Overcast, each node stores information about the status
of all nodes underneath it.  When a node fails, its children simply
re-join the tree as children of an ancestor.

This approach still has some potential issues.  Because all nodes
start out as direct children of the root node, a flash crowd could
overwhelm the link between the root node and the rest of the world,
reducing performance for everyone.  Because Overcast focuses on
bandwidth when creating trees, a large network could produce deep
trees, and a large latency between the root node and a leaf.  Using a
different metric when building the trees could improve this.  The
general structure of a tree-based system also puts more load on some
nodes than others; high-bandwidth nodes will be broadcasting out more
data than they are taking in, while leaf nodes use no outgoing
bandwidth.
