MODELING AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF BITTORRENT-LIKE PEER-TO-PEER  
NETWORKS

The paper provides an analysis of the BitTorrent network based on  
four critical factors: Peer Evolution, Scalability, File Sharing  
Efficiency, and Incentives to prevent free-riding.  Peer Evolution  
refers to arrival/departure and uploading/downloading bandwidth,  
etc., of peers over time.  File Sharing Efficiency refers to the  
system's ability to maximize bandwidth utilization across all peers.

The authors use a fluid model to analyze the system, and are able to  
draw several conclusions.  The first is that the time required to  
download a file is independent of the number of requests made for  
that file, indicating that BitTorrent has excellent scalability.  As  
expected, the greater the file sharing efficiency, the faster the  
download times, and the faster seeds leave the system, the longer the  
download times.  They find that it if users' download bandwidth is  
great enough, upload bandwidth becomes the limiting resource slowing  
down file transfer speeds.  However, if seeds leave the system  
slowly, then downloading bandwidth is the limiting resource of the  
system.

They provide an analysis of file sharing efficiency, and find that  
because files are typically broken up into several hundred chunks,  
efficiency is high even when nodes share between very few nodes.   
Sharing between more nodes increases efficiency, although slowly.

Their analysis of incentives leads to several findings.  The first is  
rational users of the system will in fact share files using all  
available bandwidth, as this will maximize their download speeds.   
However, due to optimistic unchoking, a free-riding peer will achieve  
20% of the maximum downloading rate.

The authors obtained experimental results by sharing one of their  
files.  It was downloaded less than 100 times.  Traces from this  
experiment did however match their model to some degree.  They also  
verified other aspects of their model by examining the log file from  
a BitTorrent tracker.

The degree to which the model actually matches the experimental data  
is somewhat questionable.  Visually, one can see that the only plot  
where model and data match closely is the evolution of the number of  
seeds.  BitTorrent yields a tremendously complex network, due the  
strong relationship between user behavior and sharing success rates.   
While the model follows intuition about the network, it does not  
capture any of the fine grained problems that occur in the network,  
such as when particular pieces of a file become particularly rare.   
Also, their data does not come from a popular file, as so may not be  
representative of a typical scenario.  They also seem to assume that  
users do not change the default settings for their client, without  
really justifying this.
