MODELING AND PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF BIT TORRENT..

the paper develops a simple fluid model to study the performance of Bit
Torrent.
the authors describes Bit Torrent briefly by introducing terminology such as
trackers,downloaders,seeders, and optimistic unchoking.


FLUID MODEL
a number of variables are used to model a number of system parameters.
Request arrival is assumed to follow Poisson distribution which is
justified by the fact that the number of requests in 2 disjoint intervals
is independent.

the authors derive mathematical expressions for the following:
1) the total uploading rate taken into account the case when the
downloading bandwidth is the constraint
2) rate of departures of downloaders

they calculate system parameters in steady state i.e. rate of change of
downloaders and seeders each equal to zero. Two cases arise here:
1) downloading bandwidth is the constraint
2) uploading bandwidth is the constraint

INSIGHTS:
1) the average downloading time is independent of the arrival rate of
requests -- indicating that the system will scale
2) initially when the downloading bandwidth of a peer increases, the
average downloading time decreases (obviously). however, after a certain
extent, increasing the download bandwidth does not decrease average
download time since the bottleneck shifts.


the authors also discuss the peer selection algorithm.
they conclude that there is not a Nash Equilibrium for a general network
setting but one exists when the network consists of groups of peers where
members of the group have the same upload and download bandwidths.

they  point out that optimistic unchoking has a side-effect of encouraging
free-riding.
