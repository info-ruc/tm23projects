I would say the other way around: Math is a part of logic.

   These all have roles to play in biology, both at the macroscopic and
microscopic levels, which would fit the Sympsonian thesis described
above.

If not all as fractals, just as simple programs involving repeated
application of select rules, leading to all kinds of structres an
dprocesses, including fractals on occasion.

As I understand it, these are all the results of applying continuous
mathematics to physcial processes.  As such they must apply to living
processes as necessary components (accoriding to the Simpson doctrine) but
are not sufficient to account for life (according to Elsassser).

This may be possible if we can transform quantum mechanical formalisms
into algorithmic ones using finite sets of if-then rules. This is how I
understand Wolfram's principle of computaitonal equivalence.
