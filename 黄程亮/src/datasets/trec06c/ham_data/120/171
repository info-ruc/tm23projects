Analysis of BitTorrent:

         The design of BitTorrent was very much ad-hoc.  Here, the authors 
seek to build a rigorous model of the network, using markov 
processes.  They are able to derive plausible estimates for probability of 
downloads succeeding, and for the population sizes. They demonstrate that 
under reasonable assumptions, the system converges to a Nash equilibrium 
where the optimum strategy for every node is to upload.  That is, the 
BitTorrent incentive system seems to work.
         Actual BitTorrent networks have a lot of short-term variation; the 
graphs of real networks are jagged, and the authors' predictions are 
smooth.  The model does not take short-term variation into account, and as 
a result, real BitTorrent networks can significantly deviate from 
optimum.  The proof that the system will converge to a Nash equilibrium 
seems predicated on global knowledge; there is no reason why a real 
BitTorrent like system will so converge.
