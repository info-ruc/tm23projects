 The scheduled outage of ar01-hill012-hill was unsuccessful and backed
out at 17:40.  Access to TD services including RADIUS, external DNS, and
Kerberos authentication were unavailable for approximately 40 minutes
between 17:00 and 17:40.  There were secondary interruptions in the
University LDAP and CAS services.  All services are now up and
available.  The maintenance will be rescheduled for a later date.

 If you have any questions or comments concerning this
announcement, please contact the TD-Network Operations Center at
