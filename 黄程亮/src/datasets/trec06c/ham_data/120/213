Modeling and Performance Analysis of BitTorrent-Like Peer-to-Peer Networks

This paper deals with the development of a model to analyze a variety of
performance related characteristics of a BitTorrent.  The main issues that
were considered are peer evolution, scalability, effectiveness of file
sharing, and incentives.  The authors based their approach on a fluid model=
.


Peers in the model are considered to not always "play by the rules" and
there are provisions for simulating peers that may leave the system without
completing a download and seeding.  The authors claim that scalability and
file sharing effectiveness are generally good in BitTorrent.  The download
rate did not seem to be adversely affected by the rate of incoming queries,
meaning that the system did not generally get bogged down as more peers
joined.  As the arrival rate of peers increases, performance should slowly
improve.  An interesting observation that was made is that although upload
speeds may often be much slower than download speeds for Internet
connections, the upload rate was not always the limiting factor in
BitTorrent swarms.  In cases where the seed departure rate was less than th=
e
joining rate, the downloding bandwidth ultimately determined the
performance.  The incentive mechanism was shown generally to incentivize
sharing files at a high rate.  However, it was also noted that BitTorrent
itself does not provide any incentives for nodes to seed files. Free riders
were shown to be able to get 20% of the possible maximum downloading rate
because of optimistic unchoking.  This was considered to be a problem, and
it is proposed that the system may be tuned to decrease it.

One of the biggest issues seen with this paper is that a "popular" file was
not inserted into the network.  The claim that introducing a popular file
into a BitTorrent network would necessarily infringe copyrights seems to be
a dubious claim that provided for a less than optimal simulation.  While
there is probably a legitimate debate as to the quantity of files
transferred with BitTorrent that may be infringing, there are certainly ver=
y
visible examples of legitimate, non infringing files and very popular
content that has been distributed via the network.
