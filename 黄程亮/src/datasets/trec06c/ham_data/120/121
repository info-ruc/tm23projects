A hierarchy can be viewed as a "tree" consisting of a set of bifurcations.
A bifurcation can be represented as a node connected to two other nodes. 
The simplest hierarchy is a set of n bifurcations, where n = 1 or greater.
When n=1, we have what may be called the 'unit bifurcation". A unit
bifurcation consists of three nodes connected thus: 1-2-3.  When 1 and 3
are events whose simultaneous occurrences (within a very short time range,
say, mseconds) leads to (or causes) event 2,  we may be dealing with what
may be called the "unit temporal bifurcation (UTB)".  This is equivalent
to viewing 2 as  a "coincidence detector" or a "coincidence detecting
event (CDE)".  We can easily imagine a system of two or more CDEs coupled
in such a manner as to form a tree, which may be identified with a
"temporal hierarchy":


                              1                                   2^0
                             / \
                            /   \
                           2     3                                2^1
                          / \   / \
                         /   \ /   \
                        4    5 6    7                             2^2
                       / \
                      /   \
                     8     9  10  11  12  13  14  15              2^3
                    / \
                   /   \
                  16   17  18  19  20  21  23  24  . . .          2^4

Figure 1.  A temporal hierarchy composed of  a set of coincidence-detecting
events (CDEs), each constructed from a set of three nodes, j-i-k, where
the simultaneous occurrence of events j and k leads to (or causes) event
i.

If a temporal hierarchy consists of n levels (e.g., level 1 containing
nodes 2 and 3; levels 2 containing nodes 4, 5, 6 & 7, etc.),  the nodes at
the highest level (e.g., 16, 17, 18, etc. at level 4 in Figure 1) may be
referred to as the zero^th order CDEs; the nodes at the (n – 1)^th level
as the 1st order-CDEs, etc.  The higher the order of a CDE, the smaller
would be the probability of its occurrence in nature in general, unless
promoted by some devices driven by dissipation of free energy.  Thus we
can recognize two kinds of CDEs – the passive and active CDEs.  The
temporal hierarchy (TH) built from passive CDEs may be called passive TH
and that build up of active CDEs as active TH.  It appears reasonable to
assume that living systems are examples of active THs and passive THs
belong to abiotic systems.

The idea that living systems embody active THs seems to be supported by
both theoretical and experimental evidences:

   (1)  Enzymes are active coincidence detectors in that the simultaneous
localization of four or more catalytic residues at the active site of
an enzyme at the transition state, driven by the free energy of
substrate binding, leads to catalysis (see Figure 10 in [1]).

   (2)  All molecular motors can be treated as coincidence detectors in
that the mechanical energy stored in them results from the coincidence
of  the nuclear rearrangements (also called conformation or noncovalent
changes) of proteins and the electronic transitions of bound ligands
(e.g., ATP hydrolysis to ADP and Pi, or oxidation of AH_2 to A); see
Figure 3 in [2]).

   (3)  Bacteria can act as coincidence detectors [3].

   (4)  Neurons of the visual cortex, auditory cortex, somatosensory
cortex, hippocampus, the frontal cortex, and odor sensors act as
coincidence detectors [4,5].

   (5)  The cerebral cortex responsible for consciousness may be a
coincidence detectors of neuronal firings [6].

The spatial structures of living systems (e.g., DNA double helix, 3D X-ray
structures of enzymes and biochemicals, etc.) that have been the focus of
research in molcula rbiology for over half a century may be considered as
a necessary condition but not sufficient one to give rise to life.  The
missing link may be what may be called “temporal structures” (in contrast
to "spatial structures"), which may act as the sufficient condition for
life.  In other words, spatial structures can lead to life if and only if
they can support temporal structures or active temporal hierarchies.  In
this context, the biological evolution may be viewed as the emergence of
active temporal hierarchies from passive temporal hierarchies through
dissipation of free energy:

                              Free Energy
Passive Temporal Hierarchies ------------> Active Temporal Hierarchies

Figure 2.  The biological evolution as the emergence of active temporal
hierarchies supported by spatial structures and free energy dissipation.

The root of a temporal hierarchy with n levels can be identified with an
n^th-order CDE, according to the defintions introduced above.  As can be
seen from Figure 1, an n^th-order CDE requires simultaneous occurrences
(or synchrony) of 2^n zero^th-order CDEs.  If the average probability of
occurence of a zero^th- order CDE is p, then the probability P of the
n^th-order CDE being realized passively (i.e., without any free energy
input) would be p^(2^n).  If p=0.01, then P = 1/10^(2^(n+1)), which would
be 1/10^33, a very small number.  If n = 2, then P = 1/10^8, which may be
increased close to unity (i.e., increased by a factor of 10^8), if free
energy can be utilized to promote coincidence events underlying the
n^th0order CDE.  Reducing uncertainty by a factor of 10^8 through free
energy dissipation is a common occurence in living systems.  Living
processes (e.g., enzymic catalysis, active transport, cell cycle events,
directed cell motions, etc.) appear highly improbable to us.  This may be
an illlusion arising from our ignorance about the precise mechanisms
available to living systems or their components, driven by free-energy
dissipation, that reduces uncertainty or increases the probability P to
close to unity.  If these conjectrues are valid, the following corollaries
may be deduced:

   "With appropriate spatial structures capable of utilizing free energy,
    there is no events that cannot be realized in nature with a probalilty
    close to unity."

   "Life is an inevitable consequence of some spontaneously
    occurring spatial structures capable of utilizing free energy."

   "Appropriate spatial structures and complementary free
    energy sources are necessary and sufficient to both
    originate and maintain temporal hierarchies otherwise
    known as living organisms."
