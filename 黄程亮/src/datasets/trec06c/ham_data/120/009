Thanks for that! Very comprehensive.

Sadly, I'm working from a couple of antistatic bags full of an
assortment of old DIMMs, so I generally don't know sizes &
capabilities.

I removed my 3 256s and tried what I had to hand - a PC100 256 and a
couple of 128s. The 128 didn't work - the Mac would not even "bong"
with them installed - but the 256 was OK and the machine was stable
with it. I've taken 2 128s from the other, stable machine and now have
a stable Mac with 512MB and two ATI cards, so that, at least, is a
result - but now I'm going to have to start stripping PCs and things
to get up to 640, which is about as high as I'll be able to go, and to
try to get the other Mac up to at least 512 if I can.

Thanks for the guidance!
