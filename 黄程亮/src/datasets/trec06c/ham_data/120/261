This reminds me of Ziman's distinction in science between  
consensibility (statements with the potential to create consensus)  
and consensuality (statements that have been tested and are  
"universally" accepted).  For Ziman the ideal language for effecting  
consensibility in science was mathematics.  Your issue appears to be  
with Nash working within mathematics in some purified way that is  
devoid of or uninterested in consensibility and I'm not sure that  
isn't throwing out the baby with the bathwater --particularly if a  
governing dynamic or some other "abstract" feature starts being  
observed elsewhere because of it.

Again, no real quibble -- except that the retreat into abstraction is  
never as pure as it purports or its agents would like it to be  
because abstraction per se can never be purified of the human  
entanglements giving rise to it in the first place.  A model always  
already brings forth a great deal of consensuality (agreement on what  
models are, their standard features and conventions, etc.) in an  
effort to generate consensibility around something putatively new.  I  
also think Simon's impatience needs also be contextualized historically.
