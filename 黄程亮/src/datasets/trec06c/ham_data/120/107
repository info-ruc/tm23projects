I'm reading tutorials on purify, and little comfortable using purify
and fix memory bugs.
Different to gdb, purify exactly point out the location of memory
problem.
However, memory problem came from many reasons.
They are due to mostly unintialized, beyond bounds problems.
I'm not much familar with making web pages.
And, I have something to do with purify.
I can do the tutorials on purify until 16th. April. 
This is because I'd like to have more time to understand memory
problems of C++ program.
Before that time, we can use online tutorials on purify.
I also attache extensive tutorial pages.

I'm thinking this should go under Speech->Tutorials->General.

It should not only explain how to build the IFCs with purify, but also
how to use purify to identify memory problems.  We should include an
example or two of an IFC program with memory problems, and one with
the
problems corrected.  The tutorial should include step-by-step
instructions with commands and output (similar to the IFC tutorials)
to
show how purify was used to locate the problem.

Seunchan, do you feel comfortable enough with Purify that you could
put
something like this together quickly?  This would be beneficial for
the
entire group.
