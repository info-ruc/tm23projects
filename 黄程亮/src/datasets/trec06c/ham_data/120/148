Having followed the links that George provided for Optics Express I found 
an interview with Editor-in-Chief Michael Duncan 
(<http://www.in-cites.com/journals/OpticsExpress.html>http://www.in-cites.com/journals/OpticsExpress.html) 
and was struck by this question and answer:

Is Optics Express profitable now?

We are profitable now. We have, of course, gotten more staff support from 
the Optical Society as we have grown, so our expenses have increased, but 
we are profitable. Although we are by no means at the same kind of level as 
the traditional subscription-based journals. We are a new model, but a 
successful model. And it took us a large volume of papers to get to that point.

So it would appear that for this journal at least an open access publishing 
model can work financially.

Subject: [SOAF] Optics Express - soaring citation rate


Optics Express <http://www.opticsexpress.org/>, the Open Access journal
of the Optical Society of America <http://www.osa.org/>, "... was
recognized by Essential Science Indicators
<http://scientific.thomson.com/products/esi/> as having the highest
percent increase in total citations in the field of Physics in both
September 2005 <http://www.in-cites.com/most_imp/september2005.html> and
January 2006 <http://www.in-cites.com/most_imp/january2006.html>.

A fairly obvious conclusion to be drawn from this information -- freely
available, high quality, peer-reviewed material, especially when grouped
in a topical manner (well focused journal), will be read and cited,
early and often.
