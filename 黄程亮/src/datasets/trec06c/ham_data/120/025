The emission of radiation by hydrogen atom upon absorption of light/EMF
quanta can be viewed as an instantiation of the input-state
transition-output, which is a form of computation in its widest sense.

I regard any cell as the smallest DNA-based molecular computer.  I
presented evidence in support of this notion [1].

Because we can reproduce the shapes of leaves and shells, etc. in nautre,
by executing simple programs on a computer. I think thre is something to
Wolfram's Principle of Computational Equivalence [2].

Enzymes can "switch" on or off a chemical reaction in microsends, not too
far from BOP of elementary operations in computers.  In addition, Enzymes
work in massively parallel manner, tens of thousands or more at a time.

Conformon-driven processes can be fast as indicatd above, and no charge is
required for controling conformons from outside.  Conformons are
generated, transmitted and utilized inside bipolymers mediated by Brownian
motions.

  I did not know that.

To understand life, according to Simpson, we need all the principles
operating in nature, including that of computation uncovered by computer
science.With all the best.
