OVERCAST

The primary purpose of the Overcast overlay network is to provide an  
efficient and better alternative to IP Multicast.  As it is  
implemented as an overlay, it does not require changes to network  
routers or other hardware, and thus can be deployed incrementally.   
Also, it is designed for the multicast of content which must be  
delivered in its entirety, rather than dynamically shaping content to  
ensure real time delivery like some other multicast schemes.   
Overcast also differs from IP multicast in that it allows only single- 
source multicast.

Overcast was implemented as a linux app with a single source and  
multiple clients, distributing video content.  The distribution tree  
is identified by a url, allowing clients to contact the root through  
the url, which then directs the requester to download from the  
nearest client machine with the content.  When a node joins the  
system, it must know the address of an overcast root, which it  
contacts to receive information indicating which nodes it should  
contact and what area of the internet it should serve.

Nodes attempt to organize themselves in as deep a distribution tree  
as possible which does not sacrifice their bandwidth connecting them  
to the source.  The root is eliminated as a single point of failure  
by replicating the root and using traditional DNS resolution  
techniques to spread request over the replicas.

The system has been implemented on 10s of nodes, and so is tested for  
larger networks (600 nodes) through simulation.  They find that if  
Overcast nodes are placed as if they are part of an IP Multicast  
backbone, the system is most effective, but achieves 80% of that  
bandwidth if nodes are randomly placed.  However, they have no  
simulation results to indicate how effective the system may actually  
seem to the end user.  Although the system is self configuring, they  
simulate nodes placed on relatively high speed links (T1, T3).  This  
indicates that care must be taken when deploying the system, and that  
it cannot be adopted by "standard users" of the internet who do not  
have multi-megabit connections.
