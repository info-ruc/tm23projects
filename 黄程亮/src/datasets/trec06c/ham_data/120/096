Okay, I will  do that.

Daniel, where do I put this instruction in web pages?

I resolved compilation problem with purify.
This is due to sphere utility in our system.
I also saw some memory problem in our IFC class. This need to be fixed
with purify.
So, if anyone who want to use puriry, it need to recompile repository
without sphere.
Here are instructions for compiling repository and compiling utility
program with purify.

First, instructions for compiling repository. Recently, we have many
changes in our IFC classes.
So, when doing this we will meet several problems.

cd $ISIP_DEVEL
cvs co -p -d tools .
cd tools

./configure --with-audiofile=/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/audiofile
--with-communicator=/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/communicator
--with-communicator-include=/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/communicator/include
--with-communicator-libdir=/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/communicator/lib/x86-linux
--with-sctk=/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/sctk

[ Do not include sphere utility. I removed it above configure command]
[ MAKE SURE THE SPACING AND ALL OTHER DETAILS ARE CORRECT]

MODIFY  ISIP_BASE_ENV.sh  file

[ copy and paste the followings and remove the existing  EXTRA_LIBS
and
EXTRA_INCLUDE in your ISIP_ENV_BASE.sh 
EXTRA_LIBS="-L/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/audiofile/lib
-laudiofile
 -L/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/communicator/lib/x86-linux -lGalaxy
-L -L/cavs/hse/ies/isip/users/wholland/research/expat-1.95.8/lib
-lexpat
";
EXTRA_INCLUDE="-I/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/audiofile/include
-I/cavs/hse/ies/isip/common/local/communicator/include 
-I/cavs/hse/ies/isip/users/wholland/research/expat-1.95.8/include -I ";

]

source ISIP_BASE_ENV.sh

make depend
make install [ if you want debug mode, make DEBUG=-g OPTIMIZE= install
, but it is recommanded this option in your /var/tmp  directory]

And, the following is for using purify.

export ISIP_CPLUS_COMPILER="purify -cache-dir=$HOME/cache g++"
make depend
make install  [ if you want using purity in debug mode, follow debug
mode compilation]

And, it takes about one hour to compile utility program with purify.
Until now, I summarized using purify.
If further questions or any problem with purify, please let me know.
