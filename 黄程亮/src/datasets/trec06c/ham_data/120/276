I have been surprised and interested in the comments criticizing the   
choice of John Nash for the Herbert A. Simon Award.  The contrasts  
between Nash's contributions to mathematical theory and Simon's  
desire to make theory less abstract than that seem appropriate, and  
correct as far as I know.   However, I see Nash as a reasonable  
recipient of this award from a more historical point of view.   In my  
view Nash's greatest contribution to theory development was to make  
the transition from narrowly deterministic models that yielded  
singular outcomes to ones that recognized the importance of  
contingent interactions among the agents of the process.   Nash  
opened the door to modeling dynamical systems in which outcomes are  
generated through the contingent interactions of the agents, which  
can take a variety of paths.  This approach provided a basis for  
understanding counter-intuitive outcomes that would not be expected  
from an understanding of the motivations of individuals alone.   In  
this respect, I think that Herbert A. Simon  would recognize this  
important step toward the effective modeling of complex systems and  
applaud the selection of John Nash for this award.
