The paper, "Modeling and Performance Anlysis of BitTorrent-Like
Peer-to-Peer Networks," presents a model to study the performance of
BitTorrent. These paper focuses on several issues in BitTorrent
including peer evolution, scalability, file sharing efficiency and
incentive to prevent free-riding. Peer evolution is the number of
peers in the system over time. Scalability focus on the download rate
as the size of the network grows. File sharing efficiency means the
efficiency in fully utilizing the bandwidth of all peers. Finally, it
looks at how BT uses optimistic unchoking to prevent free-riders in
the network.
       It uses a simple fluid model to capture the performance of =
BitTorrent
using parameters, such as arrival rate of new requests, uploading and
downloading bandwidth of peers, rate of downloader aborts, rate of
seeds leave the system and effectiveness of file sharing. It
analytical derives the average downloading time, the number of
downloaders and seeds in the system over time. Using this equation, it
gives some insights to BitTorrent network. One important insight is
that the download time is independent on the number of peers. However,
in this model it assumes that all peers have uniform upload and
download bandwidth. And download bandwidth is always larger than the
upload bandwidth.
       It also shows that rationale peer will share all the available
uploading bandwidth when each peer knows the uploading bandwidth of
all other peers. When there is limited information about the peers,
free-riders will only get 20% of possible maximum downloading rate.
Finally, it uses experiments to show the model reflects the behavior
of BitTorrent. However, we can see that the results in the experiments
are not accurate when the arrival rate is small (when lamda =3D 0.04.)
Second, when it compares the result with the real trace, one can tune
so many parameters to fit the curve with the real trace to fit the
oscillation in the real trace.
