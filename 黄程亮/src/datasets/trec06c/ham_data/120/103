   What I have in mind may be also considered a "temporal hierarchy",
which may be related to what Stan described above.
   A hierarchy to me means a kind of a "tree" consisting of a set of
bifurcations. A bifurcation can be represented as a node connected to
two other nodes.  The simplest hierarchy is a set of n bifurcations,
where n = 1 or greater. When n=1, we have what may be called the 'unit
bifurcation". A unit bifurcation consists of three nodes connected
thus: 1-2-3.  When 1 and 3 are events whose simultaneous occurrences
(within a very short time range, say, mseconds) leads to (or causes)
event 2,  we may be dealing with what may be called the "unit temporal
bifurcation (UTB)".  This is equivalent to viewing 2 as  a "coincidence
detector" or a "coincidence detecting event (CDE)".  We can easily
imagine a system of two or more CDEs coupled in such a manner as to
form a tree, which may be identified with a "temporal hierarchy":

                               2                            2^0
                              / \
                             /   \
                            1     3                         2^1
                           / \   / \
                          /   \ /   \
                         4    5 6   7                       2^2
                        /  \
                       /    \
                       8    9  10 11  12 13  14             2^3
                     /  \
                    /    \
                   15    16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23  . . .      2^4


Figure 1.  A temporal hierarchy consisting of  a set of
coincidence-detecting events (CDEs) (represented by nodes), each
constructed from a et of three nodes, 1-2-3, where the simultaneous
occurrence of events 1 and 3 leads to (or causes) events 2.

   If a temporal hierarchy consists of n levels (e.g., level 1  containing
nodes 1 and 3; levels 2 containing nodes 4, 5, 6 & 7; etc.),  the nodes
at the highest level (e.g., 16, 17, 18, etc at level 4 in Figure 1) may
be referred to as the zero^th order CDEs; the nodes at the (n – 1)^th
level as the 1st order-CDEs, etc.  The higher the order of a CDE, the
smaller would be the probability of its occurrence in nature in
general, unless promoted by some devices driven by dissipation of free
energy.  Thus we can recognize two kinds of CDEs – the passive and
active CDEs.  The temporal hierarchy (TH) built from passive CDEs may
be called passive TH and that build up of active CDEs as active TH.  It
seems reasonable to assume that living systems are examples of active
THs and passive THs belong to abiotic systems.
   The idea that living systems embody active THs seems to be supported by
both theoretical and experimental evidence:

(1)	Enzymes are active coincidence detectors in that the simultaneous
localization of four or more catalytic residues at the active site of an
enzyme at the transition state, driven by the free energy of substrate
binding, leads to catalysis (see Figure 10 in [1]).
(2)	Bacteria can act as coincidence detectors [2].
(3)	Neurons of the visual cortex, auditory cortex, somatosensory cortex,
hippocampus, the frontal cortex, and odor sensors act as coincidence
detectors [3,4].
(4)	The cerebral cortex responsible for consciousness may be a coincidence
detectors of neuronal firings [5].

   The spatial structures of living systems (e.g., DNA double helix, 3D
X-ray structures of enzymes and biochemicals, etc.) that have been the
focus of research for over a century now may be a necessary condition
but not sufficient one to account for life.  The missing link may be
what may be called “temporal structures”, which may act as the
sufficient condition for life.  In other words, spatial structures can
lead to life if and only if they can support temporal structures or
active temporal hierarchies.  In this context, the biological evolution
may be viewed as the emergence of active temporal hierarchies from
passive temporal hierarchies through the input of free energy:

                              Free Energy
 Passive Temporal Hierarchies ------------> Active Temporal Hierarchies

Figure 2.  The biological evolution as the emergence of active temporal
hierarchies from passive temporal hierarchies (supported by spatial
strcutures)driven by free energy dissipation.


With all the best.
