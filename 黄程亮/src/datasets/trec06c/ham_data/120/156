Class,

I have a couple of notes:

1) HW #7 is due on Thursday (as you know) and we intend to hand out 
solution sets to HW #6 and HW #7 on or before next Tuesday (April 11) 
so you can study for the midterm.  This means that no late assignments 
for HW #7 will be accepted after 9:30am on Tuesday the 11th.

2) There is some confusion on the AMAT equation, because I present it 
in a slightly different way than the book.  Here is the way to think 
about it - first the parameters for a single-level cache hierarchy:

T_hit = hit time in cache
P_miss = probability of miss in cache
T_miss = total miss time
T_penalty = miss penalty if you miss in cache

Note that T_miss = T_hit + T_penalty

In class, I presented the following equation:

   AMAT = (1-P_miss)*T_hit + P_miss*T_miss

The book present the following equation:

   AMAT = T_hit + P_miss*T_penalty

Note that these equations are actually the *same*!  Here's the proof:

     AMAT = (1-P_miss)*T_hit + P_miss*T_miss
                 =  T_hit + P_miss*(T_miss-T_hit)
                 =  T_hit + P_miss*T_penalty

At any rate - make sure to read the problem statements in the homework 
assignments carefully so that you understand exactly what is being 
asked.

Cheers,
