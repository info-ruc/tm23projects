Overcast:

Overcast is a tree-based multicast system.  Nodes connect to a root, and 
explore down the tree, along the path that yields the greatest 
bandwidth.  As a result, a node will (hopefully) come to rest at the bottom 
of the tree, with the property that the root-to-node bandwidth is 
large.  Each node keeps track of both ancestors and descendants, so failure 
recovery is straightforward.  The overall throughput is quite high, though 
not so high as mesh-based systems such as SplitStream and Bullet.
Overcast does put significant stress on the root node, requiring chain 
replication to ensure fault-tolerant behavior.  The time to reconnect if a 
node goes down may be substantial, with the system relying on caches at 
each node to replay lost content.  The high latency of deep trees may make 
Overcast unsuitable for applications other than streaming content or file 
distribution.  Since the system relies on nodes to execute the protocol 
properly, Overcast cannot be deployed on untrusted nodes.  Overcast is an 
effective system to run on dedicated multicast servers, but is not a 
general peer-to-peer multicast system.
