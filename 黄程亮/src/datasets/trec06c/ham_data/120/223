   This is a problem older versions of DMDX suffered from, I'd try the 
current version.  It's possible you have a new font class that DMDX needs 
to know about that can't ever have Word's insane 'smart' quotes, however 
the easy way to check is to try the current version.  If the problem 
persists you can send me (not the list) the RTF item file and a description 
of which frames are suffering from the problem and I'll look up the font's 
class in the RTF's headers and add it to the list of font classes that 
won't ever have smart quotes.
