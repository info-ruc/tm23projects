   My immediate suspicion would be the PIO drivers, particularly if it's 
got a Keithley card in it.  If it doesn't happen when the PIO isn't used 
then it's the PIO drivers.  If you aren't using the QPIO devices then try 
them, ie <id qpio12>.

   It's not too surprising to see DMDX peg the CPU at 100% on a syntax 
check as it's processing things as fast as it can and there are certain 
conditions that can whack a syntax check such as missing the last 
semi-colon in an item file.

   Other things include updating all the drivers you can, go to the ASUS 
page and download the latest system drivers, get new video drivers and so on.

   If it doesn't go away you'll have to start removing elements from the 
item file to determine which is tossing the machine for a loop.  I'd start 
commenting out all the PIO stuff, then the sound stuff if it's used, then 
digital video and so on.
