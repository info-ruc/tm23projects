SEMINAR -- Department of Computer and Information Science

Advanced Flow Visualization Techniques for Simulation Data

Robert Laramee, PhD
Research Center for Virtual Reality and Visualization
Vienna, Austria

2:00 p.m., Wednesday, 5 April
235 Weir Hall

As the size of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation data sets
expands, the job of the engineer to analyze, explore, and present the data
becomes more challenging.  The scientific visualization tools used by the
engineer should evolve to meet the growing demands presented by large
simulation data sets. Furthermore, no single visualization technique can meet
each users needs.

We present a detailed selection of recently developed direct, geometric, and
texture-based flow visualization techniques. These techniques address the
demand, set forth by engineers, for visualization solutions which provide
insight into CFD simulation data. Included are algorithms for (1) the
resampling of CFD simulation data, (2) fast, animated texture-based flow
visualization, and (3) geometric flow visualization including dashed,
animated-streamlines, oriented streamlines, streamlets, and streamcomets. Each
approach is targeted at the visual analysis of CFD simulation data. This
relatively new selection of techniques provides valuable tools that allow
engineers to gain insight into their CFD simulation results.

Dr. Robert Laramee is a senior researcher and software engineer at the
Research Center for Virtual Reality and Visualization (VRVis) in Vienna,
Austria.  His research interests are in scientific visualization, computer
graphics, and human-computer interaction, with an emphasis on flow
visualization.  He has a BS in Physics from the University of Massachusetts at
Amherst, an MSc in Computer Science from the University of New Hampshire, and
a PhD in computer science from the Vienna University of Technology in Austria.

Laramee is a candidate for a faculty position in the CIS Department.
