If Wolframs programs have nothing to do with reality, how can you explain
the fact that some of his programs can faithfully reproduce (within what I
recently called 'species-resemblance") the characteristic shapes of leaves
and shells?

Why not?  Just because chess playing was not regarded as science in the
past (i.e., in the era of old science), it does not mean that we should
exclude it from NKS.

I agree that Wolfram's programs are artificial and passive, while natural
processes are autonomous and self-organizing, dissipating requisite free
energy.

Perhaps we need both algorithmic and traditional mathematical approaches
to obtain "in-depth" understanding of nature. Can we call it the "hybrid"
approach?

I think Peirce would call it simply "semiotics": figres on TV screes are
iconic signs of real "meaty" humans.

Isn't it the case that certain parts of mathematics are also abstracted
from reality?

Again, I don't see why we cannot include these examples as a part of NKS.
Perhaps they were not recognized as such because the concept of NKS was
not avaialbe until 2004.

This is why I included Simpson and Elsasser in the expression, the
"Simpson-Elsasser-Wolfram framework" for modeling biological systems. 
Simpson and Elsasser emphasized the importance of the principles of
traditional science, while Wolfram focussed on the Principle of
Computational Equivalence.  We may say taht Simpson and Elsasser were
concerned about CONTENT while Wolfram was focussed on METHODS.

I think algorithmic approach coupled with powerful computation, as
distinct from traditional mathematical one, is the way to go in modeling
and simulating complex strcutres and processes in nature, including living
processes and systems.
