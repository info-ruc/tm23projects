I'm thinking this should go under Speech->Tutorials->General.

http://www.cavs.msstate.edu/hse/ies/projects/speech/software/tutorials/general/index.html


It should not only explain how to build the IFCs with purify, but also
how to use purify to identify memory problems.  We should include an
example or two of an IFC program with memory problems, and one with the
problems corrected.  The tutorial should include step-by-step
instructions with commands and output (similar to the IFC tutorials) to
show how purify was used to locate the problem.

Seunchan, do you feel comfortable enough with Purify that you could put
something like this together quickly?  This would be beneficial for the
entire group.
