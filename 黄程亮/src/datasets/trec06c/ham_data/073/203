   I have a library of code that might read .JPG bitmaps directly (I've yet 
to look at it), if I add it to DMDX large photographic images wont have to 
be converted .BMP files and will save enormous amounts of disk 
space.  Should I pursue this?  One of my original reasons for not 
supporting other file formats was that I figured anyone that wanted to 
present photographic images would want them presented with the highest 
degree of fidelity, but when you compare a 50k .JPG file to it's 4meg .BMP 
people with older systems are suddenly facing space crises if they are to 
present a large number of images.
