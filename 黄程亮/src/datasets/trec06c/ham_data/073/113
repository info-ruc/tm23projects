Dear All

I have been running primed picture naming experiments using DMDX 1.2.02 
installed on a laptop. I have recently encountered a problem whereby DMDX stopped 
asking whether I wanted to save data to disk. The response data 
consists of wav files. DMDX had been presenting the 
save data box and duly saving data but recently for no apparent 
reason it stopped presenting the dialogue box though it was still saving data to disk, 
irrespective of whether the experiment had run to completion or not. 

I fixed the problem by just deleting the copy of DMDX being used and replacing it with 
another. I wonder if anyone has any idea as to why this problem might 
have come up?

Thanks

Robert
