   Hmm, then the DX7 installation went awry.  The steps in increasing 
orders of severity I would try would be:

         1/ Get new video drivers for your video card and install them.
         2/ Install DX 7 again.
         3/ Delete the video device in the Device Manager and force it's 
re-detection.  You may have to use Safe Mode to do this.  New video drivers 
in disk so that you can use the "Have Disk" option when windows ask for 
drivers highly recommended for this step.
         4/ Install windows over the top of the existing installation.

   My bet is step number 1 is all that is necessary, put it this way, it 
has the highest chance of changing anything.
