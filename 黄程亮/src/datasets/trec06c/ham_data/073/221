   You would use the keywords (such as <mpr>) that map responses to 
different bits of the PIO-12.

   Use output switch:

0 "TTL Pulse 1" o1;
0 "TTL Pulse 2" o2;
0 "TTL Pulse 3" o3;

   You're obviously hopelessly out of your league here, you need a 
technician. o0 outputs the value 0 (low) to the 8 output pins of port C on 
the PIO12, o255 sets them all high.

   Only stuff we provide is in the TimeDX help file and what is in the 
original DMTG docs.

   Pass.
