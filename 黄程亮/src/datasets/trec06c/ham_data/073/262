Hi Jonathon,
I reinstalled the video drivers and dropped the delay from the parameter line, and
still have the same problem.  I'm trying to limit the # of back buffers that DMDX
creates by running the command line -display 3 in MS DOS, and receive the error
message "Invalid video driver name <0 Primary Driver> from Registry Key
<Software\TimeDX\2\Video-Driver>.  Is this the correct way to invoke the display n
command?  And if so, does the error message I receive when attempting to invoke the
display n command suggest that I have not alleviated the problem with my video
drivers?

Thanks,
Scott
