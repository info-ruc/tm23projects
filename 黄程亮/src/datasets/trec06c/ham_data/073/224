   Wrong, the diagram is for illustration purposes, it is not showing you 
connections.  Never saw anyone misinterpret that diagram before.  The input 
pins are 37, 36, 35, 34, and 33, of which you will more than likely only be 
interested in the first three.  A literal connection diagram would be:

                               +5v  <---------o---+
pin 37 --------------------+  pin 18         |   |

pin 35 -                |  +-------+   4.7k  /   /
pin 34 -                |          |         \   \
pin 33 -                +--+       |         |   |        \
pin 32 -                   |       |         |   |          \
pin 31 -                   |       +---------o----------o     o----+
pin 30 -                   |                     |                 |
                            |                     |        \        |
pin 10 -                   |                     |          \      |
pin 11 -                   +---------------------o------o     o----o

pin 17 - pb7: aux input Bit15                                      .

                                                                 ground
                                                                 pin 19
   The third button connects to pin 35.

   You will also have to change <mip> if you use other pins for input.
