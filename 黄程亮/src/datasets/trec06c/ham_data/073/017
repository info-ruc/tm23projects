Dear sir:

We tried this code you mailed us:

0 <wav> "file" <svp start> o0 / o255;

I believe the "o0" is supposed to read "%0". I assume the o255 is supposed
to represent the trigger that goes out to the EEG machine.  

We tried this code, but it still appears that the trigger occurs after the
sound is done playing, as indicated by the fact that are N100s appear to
occur about 50ms too early.

According to the help documentation, this code should work.  However, it
occurs to me that perhaps the mess up is due to the fact that the wave file
is 50ms in duration, whereas the default frame duration (near as I can
figure) is 1 tick.  I'm not sure of default frame duration, since I'm new
to DMDX, but I assume that in my parameter line the "f1" indicates the
default frame duration parameter.  It appears in my parameter line like this:

<ep> <azk> f1 (etc. etc.)

My thinking is that I can change this default to something higher, say f5,
and then my wav files will not exceed the default duration, and the wave
file should then be simultaneously presented with the trigger.

How does this sound?
