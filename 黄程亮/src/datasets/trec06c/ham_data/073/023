   Unless you've overridden the default delay after each item there will be 
a delay of something like 1/2 a second.  the blank frame the end also adds 
another tick but that's not the right order of magnitude for your 
error.  <ms%> relies on how well you have timed the display retrace rate, 
if that's wrong ms% will be wrong too.

>Thus what is the maximum for ms% to bet set ?

   No limit.

   See the help file under Errors you might encounter (not that they are 
errors).

   That's what DMDX does.  How about reading the help file, the bit about 
how DMDX operates?
