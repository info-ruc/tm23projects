   Your video drivers are broken.  If new video drivers don't fix the 
problem you may have to invoke DMDX with the -display N to limit the number 
of back buffers DMDX creates.  Values for N should be based on the number 
of screens that DMDX displays correctly before all hell breaks loose.

   Standard stuff, if these errors are occuring on the first frame of the 
items and if you are using a D parameter images can take longer than the 
default delay and will cause these errors.

   Yup, a D of 10, unless they're _way_ small images no machine on the face 
the planet can currently read two bitmaps in 10 ticks.  That preparation A 
time of 438.45 msecs above indicates you've got more like 1/2 a second read 
time, something like a <d 40> would be more appropriate (or 
larger).  Better yet, don't use delay parameters unless you have to.
