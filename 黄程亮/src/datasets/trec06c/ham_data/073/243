Dear Jonathon,

I am currently trying to simultaneously display 2 .bmp files.  The first 3
trials of the block run fine.  However, during the time that the 4th trial
should appear, DMDX sequentially redisplays the previous 3 trials (items are not
in their original locations--the images are off the screen,  cue words are in
different locations).  Next, it moves onto the 4th, 5th, and 6th trials, runs
them correctly, and then re-displays trials 4-6 in a similar manner to trials
1-3.  The .bmp files are 1555 kb; my computer has NVIDIA TNT 2 M64 4XAGP video
card, and 128 MB RAM, so I think this should be sufficient to run the block.  Or
are these files simply too large?

In the dialogue box, some messages I receive are:  Display error at Tick 15;
moved into VM 5 ticks late.  Prep A .05 msec, b 0.52 msec.  Display error at
tick 632, moved into VM 25 ticks late, Prep A 438.45 msec, B 30.55.

I've included my parameter line and 1st 4 trials below.

Any suggestions you can provide will be apreciated.

Thanks.
