Aside from the economics of web access to music and other materials as
cogently presented by John Chambers, _Waifs and Strays_ was published in
1922, and (if I understand the regulations correctly) is therefore no
longer protected by copyright under U.S. laws. See:

<http://www.loc.gov/copyright/circs/circ1.html#hlc>

It just squeaked under the copyright extension to 95 years from 75 passed
in 1998.
