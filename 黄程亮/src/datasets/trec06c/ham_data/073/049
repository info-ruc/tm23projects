Sorry about that eirlier post fokes ~ but I was useing what was posted from 
Fred, that said for us to use this e-mail address:

lugnet.robotics.handyboard@lugnet.com

when posting to the Handy Board list or by way of the Lugnet web page.

It seams that this is the correct e-mail address afterall:
handyboard@media.mit.edu

Anyway ~ I had a question and wanted to ask someone this:

Is there a program that will allow you to write and upload Basic programs to 
the HB ~ something Sim. to that used by the Basic Stamp???

I am new to "C" ~ and I still haven't mastered it enough to do all the things 
that I can using Basic and the Basic Stamp.

The Basic language I have used for 17 years now ~ and have used in projects 
with the PIC of the Basic Stamp many times for class projects.

I took the time and expense to build a HB ~ and it works very well.

Well done on the design Fred ~ and I love your work with the LEGOs mindstorm 
also ~ my son loves it ~ and so do I (40 years old ~ but always a kid at 
heart), but my problem is programming the HB to do all the things I want to 
do with it ~ Plus I have a robotics project that is coming up due for class 
very soon.

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated !!!!!!

Steve
