   I'm going to add another series of keywords to DMDX, the ability to call 
a  function, gosubs, subroutines, whatever you want to all them (I'm 
sticking to call).  Given the way I've restructured the branching code and 
the way it lends itself to calling functions and a couple of paradigms 
needed around here (custom feedback routines and automatic pausing for 
continuous jobs when there's no response) and the elegance of a simple call 
ability to solve them I'm going to stick calls in there.  It'll just be one 
level of calling though, I don't want to have to deal with recursive item 
files screwing up -- if someone really needs multiple levels it can be 
added later.
