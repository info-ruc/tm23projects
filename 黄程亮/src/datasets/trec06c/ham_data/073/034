Dear Professor, 

Here's a new service that can help you enrich your teaching.  Share 

your needs and let us help you fill them.

How many times have you said--

"You know, I'd use the Web as a teaching resource if I could find 

something on it I really needed."

"I just wish I could find a module on________________--the textbooks 

are all lousy in covering it.  Only a couple of students actually get 

the concept.."

_______________________________________________________________________

If lack of availabilty of good multi-media instructional materials (or 

their cost) is a problem, a solution may be just a click or two away. 

HigherEdWorld, the world's first CLEARING HOUSE AND EXCHANGE for 

web-based instructional modules, maintains Web boards that allow 

professors in higher education to exchange ideas for rich media, Web 

delivered materials. If you have a need for something in your field or 

in a cognate discipline, why not post that need and see if a colleague 

at another insitution has something already developed or would be 

willing to develop and share the module you need. 

There are no fees-HigherEdWorld provides an exchange medium that allows 

like-minded academics to work collegially to meet each other's needs 

instead of depending on textbook publishers.

If you have Web based materials (simulations, videos, audios, 

animations) that you would be willing to share with colleagues why not 

post what you have on our on-line registration form and HigherEdWorld 

will contact you and explain how simple it is to make them part of our 

media exchange.

Please peruse our web site at XXXX://www.higheredworld.org Fill out our 

on-line registration form and view our demonstration module.

                                       Sincerely, 
                                       Stephen Haliczer
                                       Distinguished Research Professor
