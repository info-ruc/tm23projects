   The data that it's asking to save is the ascii response data, not the 
wav files, they are written as item file runs.  Usual culprits for that 
kind of behavior are the hard disk becoming full (doesn't sound like you're 
explanation though if the wav files are still getting saved) or the files 
are being saved in the root and you've got one of those old disk formats 
that has a maximum number of files for the root and that number has been 
reached, or the item file gets changed (you wouldn't belive the number of 
people I've had that swear that they didn't change _anyhting_ but when the 
item file is examined it's "oh, I did change that...").
