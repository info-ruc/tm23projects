   If you can find them there were Riva128 based PCI cards with S-video (I 
just leant one out) but I don't recall the brand names.  As far as I'm 
concerned there are no video cards to avoid currently, they all work, worst 
case is you need reference drivers (as in the case of the Matrox G400 based 
cards and it would appear the TNT2 M64).  Although there have been multiple 
NVIDIA based cards in the past with S-video ATI based cards are probably 
the way to go now, dunno if they make a PCI card anymore though.  The 
NVIDIA TNT2 M64 cards come in a PCI variant, again, not sure if it's got 
S-video though.
