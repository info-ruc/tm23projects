This is the right way to do it however, you need to make sure of two
things:


1) that you use a non-proportional font like "courier". If you use
"times" or "arial" then the different widths of the letters make it
impossible to align the inside edge of the word.


2) that the total number of characters in each line is the same. DMDX
centres the display on the screen based on the total width of characters,
so you need to make sure this is the same for every line in your item
file. Thus each line should be set up like the following example (I've
used a . instead of spaces to make it more obvious what I've done - if
you view this email in Courier then things should be even clearer).


<bigger>+1 *  "....ash....bacon.." /; 

+2 *  "..bacon....game..." /; 

+1 *  "longest....ash...." /; 

+2 *  "..bacon....longest" /; 


What you need to do is fill out each side of the display to make a
constant number of characters for each word (irrespective of the number
of letters in the word). So the word "ash" needs four extra spaces to
match it to the longest word "longest" which has seven letters.


You can put these extra spaces into your file by hand, however, you may
find it quicker to create the text sections in a spreadsheet package like
Excel. You can use text formulae like "len", "rept", "concatenate", to
automatically put the right number of spaces in the right places.


</bigger>Hope this helps,


Matt


PS This feels like a bit of a hack... it would be better if there was a
way of specifying <<right justify> or <<left justify> for text strings.
That way you could use <<x> and <<y> to do this sort of display using
proportional fonts. Any chance of putting this into the next version,
Jonathan?
