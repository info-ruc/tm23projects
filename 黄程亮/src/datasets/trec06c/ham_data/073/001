   Not yet, sorry.  There is however no limit on item file size...  If it's 
really a pain I can stick the code in over the next day or two and you can 
test it if you want.

   It is unclear from your explanation exactly what you want, it sounds 
like you want a contingency in DMDX, something that is very difficult to 
code as it's only decision making process right now is based on subject 
error rate.  You can get DMDX to be driven by the RF machine assuming the 
RF machine can produce a TTL level signal or a switch closure -- in either 
event I recommend opto-isolating the machines.  You buy a PIO12 clone (see 
TimeDX PIO help file) and use one of it's bits as a Request input and make 
the RF machine drive DMDX that way.  But it's an implicit assumption that 
the number of triggers from the RF machine is the same as the number of 
items in the itemfile, anything more is going to require a very flexible 
decision making system to be implemented, something I have yet to settle on 
a design for as it has not been needed to date and I don't gaily add 
features to DMDX lightly as reduced complexity is a definite boon.  Hell, 
we have enough trouble documenting it's current abilities.  I guess if you 
really need DMDX to continue doing something for an arbitrary externally 
controlled interval you could map the external signal to the positive 
response and get DMDX to loop as long as the error rate is 0%, as soon as 
the signal stops coming DMDX will timeout and the error rate will be 100% 
and it will continue.
   DMDX can be made to trigger other equipment using the PIO12 and the O 
switch (or the <output> keyword) as well.
