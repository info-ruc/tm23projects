   Those are the ones DMDX will interface with.

   Nope.

   Any interface card based on an 8255 would work, you'd just have to 
specify it's address in TimeDX's PIO test -- actually you usually have to 
do that anyway, the default address we use (and therefore TimeDX uses) is 
310 vs. the 300 the cards come set at.

   Set a negative Delay parameter, it'll just take longer on the bigger 
items.  Assuming you want a fixed ISI you'll have to set a D that's big 
enough for the biggest.  Only other thing to do is to buy a faster hard disk.
