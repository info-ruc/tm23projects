I'd say this would be a very useful thing to have for the following reason.

A problem that local users have had is that it takes a variable amount of
time to load pictures from disk. For experiments where the time between
trials is critical (as is the often the case in functional imaging - e.g.
PET, fMRI) then loading smaller files should reduce the potential for
variation in inter-trial-intervals - smaller picture files should allow
more reliable timing between trials (shorter preparation times, for example). 

I also imagine that on modern systems loading a 50k .jpg and converting it
will be faster than loading a 4meg .bmp. This sort of speed improvement
would be useful for people wanting to display long sequences of pictures
with fast ITIs.
