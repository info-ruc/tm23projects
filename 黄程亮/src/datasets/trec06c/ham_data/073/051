I think Fred is migrating away from the MIT mailing list.  Both still work
currently.  Anyway, your message to lugnet.robotics.handyboard@lugnet.com
was probably rejected because you hadn't filled out the news-posting setup
form[1] yet to let the server know who you were, so it could recognize your
'From:' header as a valid one.
