   Never trust me, from the docs under "Command line options":

-display n
         Causes DMDX to use display driver number n, handy in a multimon 
system with a remote subjects display when you want to test something 
without going to the subjects display, you can have two shortcuts to DMDX, 
one that uses the normal subjects display and another with the command line 
parameter -display 1 for using the primary display for output.  The n comes 
from the number that is the first part of any display driver name as 
displayed by TimeDX's Video Driver selection dialog.

   (that would be the wrong switch to use)

-buffer n
         Some video card drivers are f..., well, broken and return errors 
(or cause crashes) if DMDX requests large numbers of back buffers, notably 
the Cirrus Logic 5465 AGP drivers.  This may be caused by some confusion 
over what is video memory and what is not, in any event the user needs a 
way to override DMDX'
s calculation of the number of video buffers available and this is it.

   (this would be the correct option for you to use)
