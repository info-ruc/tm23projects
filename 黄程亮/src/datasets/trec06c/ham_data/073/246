I have been trying to set DMDX up to run in 640x480 video mode, but scan 
less than 480 (say 200) lines vertically. To do this, I selected 640x480 (8 
bit) in TimeDX, specified 200 scan lines, tested the video mode, and saved 
values in registry, just as one would do for any normal video mode. So far, 
so good. Then in the .rtf file, I specified <VideoMode 640,480,200,8,0>. 
When I came to run the script however, DMDX complained that I had not tuned 
vertical retrace values (which I definitely had). I tried again several 
times, but no joy. I have tried other video modes, other numbers of scan 
lines, and several versions of DMDX, including the latest, but still no 
joy. DMDX seems to only accept video modes that use the full number of scan 
lines available in a particular video mode.

Has anyone out there made this work? Does anyone have any ideas about why I 
can't make it work?

Thanks,
Michael Johnston
