I am using DMDX to present single letter stimuli to subjects at
250ms/letter.  Some of the letters are blue, the rest are black.  The
subject's task is to count the number of blue letters (this is the primary
task) while waiting for a stimulus ( a white ball) to come into view from
the periphery, at which time they are supposed to look toward the white
ball (the secondary task)and then report the number of blue letters they
counted.  I want to be able to stop the presentation of the letters when
they look away from the computer screen and somehow save a record of the
letters that have been presented (including the color of the letters) so
that I can go back later and check their accuracy as a measure of whether
they were really paying attention to the letters or not.  Is there some
way to do this?  I know that when I use the escape key my only choices are
abort or not abort.  Thanks for any help you can give,

Kathy Mohan
