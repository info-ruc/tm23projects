   It occurs to me (during evening meditation of course) that there are a 
couple of explanations for John Kline's trouble synching the output of the 
PIO12 with the audio.  First is not likely to be the solution as I suspect 
it would produce the opposite effect they are measuring and that is that 
the sound system in his machine actually has 50ms of latency in it -- have 
you guys measured the latency of that sound card?  Second is more likely to 
be the explanation and that is that you can't actually stick an output 
keyword in an audio frame (contrary to what I may have said a last week), 
at least not one that will be synched with the audio.  Because audio frames 
generate no display they are very odd beasts as far as DMDX is concerned, 
they become more like place holders for commands to be given to the audio 
thread (which executes them at a later date) so PIO12 output requests in 
them might not be a good idea, a much better idea is to place the output 
instruction in a visual frame, even if you have to build a frame that has 
the same visual display in it as is already on the screen.  Without delving 
into the code too deeply and taking time off from writing the branching 
code (which I'm not going to do) I can't get any more explicit.
