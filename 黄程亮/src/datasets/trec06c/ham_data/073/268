   It means the D1 is not enough, just the first one though.  I set a D1 
there because we wanted the sequence to begin as rapidly as possible after 
the FMRI triggered DMDX, obviously you're going to have to use a D of 5 or 
more.

   The short answer is "You can't".  The long answer is that you may be 
able to lie to your windows installation about the monitor you have and 
fool it into thinking it can't go at 75Hz but windows has a knack of 
re-detecting the monitor some time later and screwing your experiments 
up.  You could try using progressively higher video modes will the refresh 
rate drops, but of course your bitmaps are going to get smaller unless you 
tell DMDX to stretch them (might work well enough).  But either way of 
course then the refresh interval will be 16.66ms -- so then you could try 
removing lines from one of those modes (assuming you are using the primary 
monitor for DMDX's output which is more than likely, doesn't sound like 
you've got a multi-monitor setup).
