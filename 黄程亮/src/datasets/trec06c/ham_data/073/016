Just 2 comments :

1- I would be in fact useful to have DMDX accepting loop
This could done in two ways :

- either just have loop x time ......... done (means do exactly the some display
for x times)

- or having somehow

WITHCONDITIONS " conditions"
WITHDATA  "images"
#1 <bmp> * "#2>/;

DATA "images"
"image1"
"image2"
"image3"

Conditions "conditions"
"+001"
"-002"
"-003"

But this wil be probably to much work .

Multiplying lines is not that much a problem if
not making timing wrong !!!

2- I got the answer for trigerring with you present answer as well as from Mike
Ford. Thanks you
