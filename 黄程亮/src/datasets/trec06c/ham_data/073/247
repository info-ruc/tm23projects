   I got the code working today, of the five .JPGs I have one was read 
incorrectly (it was not one submitted by a DMDX user though), a fault I 
suspect that probably lies within the library but could possibly be some 
unusual thing that I'm not handling correctly (given the fact that there 
are no unusual things that I've seen in the documentation w.r.t. 
decompression I'm betting it's the library).  There will be an update 
tomorrow and everyone can check for themselves if it handles their 
particular .JPG files.
