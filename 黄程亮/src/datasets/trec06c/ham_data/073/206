   In fact the opposite is true, because a .JPG is such a CPU intensive 
thing to load and because it's compression varies so dramatically from one 
image to the next it's time to load is going vary wildly -- whereas .BMPs 
the same size are going to take the same amount of time, the only thing 
that could slow it down would be having the images on wildly different 
parts of the disk.

   That much is true, overall .JPGs are going to be much faster for the 
same sized image.
