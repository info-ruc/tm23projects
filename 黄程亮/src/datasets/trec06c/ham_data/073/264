   On timing issues, if people require the fastest possible bitmap displays 
they should convert their bitmaps to 256 color .BMP files, however they 
should still use a 16 bit display, or possibly a 24 bit display.  Because 
the image is displayed on an RGB surface the fact that it's encoded as a 
256 color palettized surface doesn't matter, no changing of colors to match 
a system palette occurs (some changing does occur as a 16 bit surface is 5 
bits of red, 6 of green and 5 of blue whereas a 256 color palette has 6 of 
everything but that's trivial or if it does matter use a 24 bit display 
mode) and because each image is encoded separately the palette for the 
image can be super fudged by the conversion program to match the colors in 
the image -- it's impressive what a bit of dithering will achieve.  800x600 
8 bit .BMPs load in 50ms on my test bed (preparation A times) vs. 150ms for 
24 bit .BMPs vs. 300ms to 600ms for .JPGs.  All have a preparation B time 
of about 40ms (the time to make a DMDX frame out of them once loaded into 
memory).
