   Well, I hate to sound like a car salesman, but is this ever your lucky 
day!  Fortunately for you I have been laboring mightily night and day for 
the last week or two to implement features to do just what you need!  All 
you need to is send money in an unmarked envelope to... just 
kidding.  You'll need to make each letter presentation an item gathering an 
RT, you'll need to turn feedback off, you'll need to set the timelimit to 
however long you want between letters.  You could in fact do it with old 
features in DMDX, just doing the above, all the RT's will be -timilimit 
till you abort the job, from the item numbers you can keep a track of what 
happened.  However using the new counters and a branch (not new) and the 
new <emit> keyword the process can be neatened up considerably.  You'll 
want to setup two counters, one getting incremented for blue letters, one 
for black, maybe another for both, it's up to you.  The items will have a 
branch  on correct response (you won't respond till you want DMDX to stop 
and it will be with the correct response key, not the ESC key) to the end 
of the item file.  Something like this (assuming you want scrambling):

F30 <nfb> S1 T1000
$ 0 "Black and Blue letter presentation" <set 1,0> <set 2,0>;$
+1 * "blackletter" / <inc 1> <bic 1000>;
+2 * "blueletter" / <inc 2> <bic 1000>;
...many more items...
$ 1000 "end" <emit 1> <emit 2>;$
