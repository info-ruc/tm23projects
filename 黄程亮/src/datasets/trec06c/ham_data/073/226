Dear all,

Hope someone would be able to offer me some advice on this as I am stuck
on the following :

I want to display a two video files (discrimination task)
on the same item  with a blank screen displaying in between (either 1500 or
500 msec). And within my design, i have three different presentation
conditions, with auditory-only (the item was presented with a still picture
with the audio input), Visual-only (visual input with the person
articulating the words but with no audio output), and last Audio-visual
(with both audio and visual output).and, only the Auditory-only 500 msec
condition seems to be playing up.

I had the following code written

Auditory-only trial: 500msec

+250  "ready" / <dv -1,-1, 352,264> "A_Fan1a.mov" <pdvf 27> <pdvt 63> /
<ms% 333> / <dv -1, -1, 352,264>  "A_Fan1b.mov" <pdvf 28> <pdvt 64>  <dv*
32>  ;

1500msec condition : AO

+250  "ready" / <dv -1,-1, 352,264> "A_Fan1a.mov" <pdvf 27> <pdvt 63> /
<ms% 1333> / <dv -1, -1, 352,264>  "A_Fan1b.mov" <pdvf 28> <pdvt 64>  <dv*
32>  ;

Visual -only trial: 500msec

+250  "ready" / <dv -1,-1, 352,264> "V_fan1a.mov" <pdvf 8> <pdvt 62> / <ms%
333> / <dv -1, -1, 352,264>  "V_fan1b.mov" <pdvf 8> <pdvt 63> <dv* 12>  ;

1500msec:

+250  "ready" / <dv -1,-1, 352,264> "V_fan1a.mov" <pdvf 8> <pdvt 62> / <ms%
1333> / <dv -1, -1, 352,264>  "V_fan1b.mov" <pdvf 8> <pdvt 63> <dv* 12>  ;


in the AO 500 msec condition, the still face component was remain on the
screen during the 500msec or sometimes.no gap in between.  the blank screen
is not displaying consistently. but the audio component was playing like
normal.

And this is only happening in the AO 500 msec condition, AO- 1500 msec
trials were playing the same as other  AV/VO trials with a blank screen gap
between.

The audio trials were intending to be playing from certain no. frame (as
where the actually audio component starts), different from other AV/VO
trials in which all items start from the 8th frame of the video file.
Although the AO comprised of a still face, it is saved as a quicktime movie
file as other AV,VO files.

I tried also to written the AO code, so that it plays from the 8th frame of
the files and having the clock on the 12th frame as other AV/VO , but still
playing up.

and also can anyone tells me whats this dialogue box says : "Multiple use of
BIC" referring to ? it keeps poping up at the start up of  DMDX  (the 2.2.00
version)


Any suggestions on this ???

Thanks
Susanna.
