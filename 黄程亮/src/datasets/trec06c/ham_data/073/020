Ken,

Thanks for the reply to Steve's query.  Our problem is that we are trying
to time lock a trigger to a 50 msec wav file, and the trigger still appears
to be going out after the sound file has completed.  

Here is the parameter line of the file:

<ep> <azk> f1 # <timeout 3000> <ID PIO12> <delay 0> <id "keyboard"> <mr +g>
<mnr +f>  <!safemode 1> <vm 640,480,480,16,0> <id mouse> <mr +button 1><bgc
000000000><dwc 255255255><eop>

and here are some of the items:

1 o0 <ms% 3950> g"blank"/ <ms% 50><ne>/  <wav> "white104" <svp start> %0 /
<ms% 10000>  o104/;
20 o0 <ms% 6000> g"dia_er" o10/;
30 o0 <ms% 10000> g"blank"/;
40 o0 <ms% 4450> g"tri" o10/ <ms% 50> <ne> o0/ <wav> "white104" <svp start>
%0 / <ne><ms% 1500> o104/;

Note that the program is set up to: 1.) present a graphics file, and 2.) at
some point after the onset of the graphics file, simultaneous present a wav
file.  We are also triggering to some of the graphics files as well.

Any insight that you might have about possible errors in our code would be
most appreciated.  We are all fairly new to DMDX.

thanks,

John Kline
