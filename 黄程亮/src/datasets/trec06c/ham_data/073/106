If you mean a older lego 4.5V motor, then yes, it will work OK (I suppose).
The max. voltage I ever ran a 4.5V battery at was 54V, and it seemed to survive
OK.  (Nom. 54V, I doubt more than 40 actual volts...I was launching airplanes
with it...)

Do so at your own risk however...don't come crying to me if it burns up.
