   You might wan to try the above with a Delay parameter as well, it not 
only sets the default delay between items, it forces DMDX to throw an error 
if it can't meet the requirements (so you can scale things 
appropriately.  Note the erase frame at the end of your items takes 1 tick 
to be displayed too.

   Probably many more, you can see how many DMDX is using by looking the 
top of the diagnostics text display.  It varies depending on the video mode.

   Not unless you make them part of one item.

   You might want to try something like the following:

d223
0  "TTL Puse 1"  ;
250 d1 <bmp>"Image1";
250 <bmp> "Frame1";
+001 d447 <bmp> *"Image2";
250 <bmp> "Frame2";
250 d447...

   That way the delay for the following item sets the display duration of 
the previous item (because they aren't erased and are just left on the 
screen).  Image reading will occur during the display of the previous items.

   FMRI timing is always tricky but never impossible, there are numerous 
people here using FMRI, perhaps they can send you some of their scripts for 
examples.
