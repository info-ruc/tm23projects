I have written new item files incorporating your advice on using counters
to keep track of the blue and black letters that are presented to
subjects.  When I tried to run the file, I found that the version of DMDX
that I had was not the latest, so I downloaded the newest version, and
tried to run TimeDX and got a message that I needed a newer version of
DirectX.  So I downloaded that from Microsoft and installed it.  The first
time I tried to run TimeDX with the new version of DirectX installed, I
started with the Select Video Mode, and it seemed to start fine, but then
the screen went white with a black rectangle right in the center and I got
the following error messages (in the following order):
	Error
	Get DC for memory surface failed!
	DDERR_CANTCREATEDC (88760249)
	Windows can not create any more DCs

	Failure
	Blit to back surface failed
	DDERR_SURFACELOST (887601C2)
	Access to this surface is being refused because the surface is
gone.  The DIRECTDRAWSURFACE object representing this surface should have
Restore called on it.

	Next it repeated the above Error message

Then:	Failure
	Flip failed
	DDERR_SURFACELOST (887601C2)
	Access to this surface is being refused because the surface is
gone.  The DIRECTDRAWSURFACE object representing this surface should have
Restore called on it.

Then: 	it repeated the same error message as above.

I exited TimeDX and tried again, but it now just goes right to the white
and black screen and the error messages.
I don't know if I have any more relevant information.  Can you help?
Thanks, 

Kathy
