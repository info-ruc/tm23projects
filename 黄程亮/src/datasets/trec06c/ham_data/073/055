  I've used Karl's sbasic a LOT on a Marvin Green Botboard 2 with great
results.  Its Basic, plain and simple.  Which means its pretty verbose, C
is a bit cleaner, but to each their own.
  I have a Miniboard that I use the freeware ICC11 with and I love it, I have
yet to find a W95 downloader that works with it so I have to live with DOS,
but, what do you want for nothing?  Anyway, Karl's sbasic should be the toy
for you if you want Basic.  Go for it.

IMO,
DLC
