   My guess is that you need to some quality time with the Refresh Rate 
command in TimeDX.  Do the <> and >< toggle back and forth smoothly or are 
they jerky?  If they are jerky are they just jerky at the beginning or all 
the time?  If jerky at the beginning then you need to alter the parameters 
to the Refresh Rate detection so it uses more flips and also discards more 
flips at the beginning.
