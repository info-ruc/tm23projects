   In building the counter code I've had to completely restructure all 
existing branching code (I knew there was a reason why I wasn't putting the 
counter stuff in there) so people will probably want to test existing 
branching scripts when I release the new version.  I've also deprecated 
<bierLT> and <birnLT> (they're not in the help file anymore) and instead 
have added <bierLE> and <birnLE> to bring the various branching keywords 
into uniformity.
