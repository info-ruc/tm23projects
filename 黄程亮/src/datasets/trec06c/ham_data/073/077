Wow... this got clipped off.  Sorry about that.  I was going to say that
we've tried this a few different ways.... I imagine that it is now a matter
of tweaking until we get it right.  In any event, the oscilloscope will be
necessary to verify our code is doing what we want it to as well. 

thanks,

John
