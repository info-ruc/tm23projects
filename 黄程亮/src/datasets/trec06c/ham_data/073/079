   Depends how much money you've got and what computers are typically found 
in your lab.  If you've got money to burn the PCI cards are more future 
proof -- there are many motherboards sold now without any ISA slots.  If 
your machines are predominantly ISA and you don't have much money then an 
ISA version is fine, all our interface cards are ISA and I've yet to see a 
PCI PIO12.  However I'm betting that machines five years from now won't 
have ISA slots and upgrades done then are going to require the more 
expensive PCI card, but maybe the price of PCI cards will down by then, 
it's certainly dropped quite a bit over the last two years.
