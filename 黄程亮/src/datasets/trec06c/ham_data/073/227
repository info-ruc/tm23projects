   You can't leave a frame of Digital Video on the screen.  If you're 
having trouble with unusual DV files it's because the codecs installed on 
your machine that are being used to play them back can't understand your 
unusual format.  I'd suggest making .BMP of the still frame you want and 
then using the <StreamingAudio> keyword instead.  BTW, <sa> should be able 
to play just the audio portion of the existing digital video, it should 
just ignore the video component.

   Well that's really interesting, that's an internal diagnostic telling me 
that I've used the mnemonic BIC twice, dunno why I don't see it here 
because the mnemonic for <CallIfCorrect> was <bic> instead of <cic>.  More 
multimon weirdness, damn.  Fixed in 2.2.02 that's up there now.
