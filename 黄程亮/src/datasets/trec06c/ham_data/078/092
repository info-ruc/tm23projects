This paper gives a theoretical approach to estimating throughput of
wireless networks.  It brings several insights to light: That each node's
throughput is limited by the load imposed by other nodes, and that even
when the nodes are located optimally (albeit on a disk) a node's
throughput is reduced by a factor of 1/sqrt(n) which becomes insignificant
as the number of nodes increases. However, for communicating with
neighbors, a constant bit rate is predicted.

This paper was very well written, and addresed a long standing need for
more formal models for ad-hoc networks.  It had a lot of formal proofs,
most of which I skipped over, but it seems their conclusions have merit.

It also points towards the future of ad-hoc networks, and the perhaps the
need for core-based routing protocols where the size of the local networks
can be kept small enough such that a throughput degradation is kept
manageable.  In this case, the pattern of communication will be non-random
(i.e. communication will mainly (hopefully!) be local) and the result here
may not apply.
