TinyOS and Smart Dust are the system architecture for sensor networks.
The technology advance such as MEMS, low-power communication devices
enables the micro-level wireless sensor networks. However, each network
element has still lots of limitations such as battery, communication
bandwidth, memory and computation power. These two projects try to
provide efficient architecture to overcome the limitations.

In my opinion, the main problem of the micro-sensor networks is
that they don't have good practical applications yet. Their micro-level
size implies critical resource limitations, so provides good research
topics. But, on the contrary, it can be the main obstacle that prevents
these techniques from being used practically. And, in my opinion, it is
still very hard to overcome those limitations with the techniques proposed
here.
