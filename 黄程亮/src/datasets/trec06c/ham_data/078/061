Performance Comparison of AODV and DSR

This paper presents a comparison of the aodv and dsr routing protocols.  
They specifically want to look at how the differences in the two 
protocols contribute to their performance on ad-hoc networks.  

DSR uses source routing, so the nodes are able to obtain more information 
by listening to other routes and peeking at the source routes on 
packets.  Contrary to DSR, AODV only really sees routes in terms of it 
successor.  Because of this, DSR uses caching quit agressivley and may see 
multiple replies to a route, but a node in AODV will only receive one 
reply from the destination for each route request. Finally, DSR doesn't 
expire stale routes, leading to misleading state being kept around on nodes.


For the simulator, they used ns-2 like the other paper we read.  They 
also use a random waypoint mobility model in a rectangular field with 50 
and 100 nodes.  The results indicate that with high mobility, the route 
caches used in DSR hinder its ability to find routes and so AODV performs 
better.  But with low mobility, AODV is affected every time a link fails, 
but DSR is unaffected by these link failures, and so it performs better 
at lower mobility rates.  DSR consistantly had fewer routing packets 
overall in the simulations, but it generated more unicast routing packets, 
which were expensive in the MAC layer simulator they used, and did not 
translate to smaller network load. They claimed that the combination of 
MAC layer and on-demand routing hinders the network capacity, and 
mention this as a point for future work.
