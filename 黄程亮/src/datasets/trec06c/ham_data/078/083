This paper is a simulation/analysis study on the capacity of ad hoc
wireless networks. They changed simulation parameters such as network size,
traffic patterns and local radio interactions, and analyzed the results.
They even validate some simulation results with experiments.

This paper showed that the capacity of networks highly depends on the
traffic pattern. If the distance between the source and the destination
does not remain small, the capacity can not be scaled up with the
network size. Therefore, the feasibility of large ad hoc networks is
determined by the locality of traffic.

In my opinion, the main contribution of this paper is that it analyzed
the relationship between traffic pattern and network capacity.
Other papers we have talked used very simple traffic patterns and did
not pay attention to the network capacity much. But this paper showed
this feature clearly, which can be used for the future protocol
development.

One think I'd like to point out is that this paper assumed static
ad hoc network. Their reason for this assumption is that nodes do
not move much during packet transit times. But, I think this might
be over-simplified. As far as I know, any intensive study on the
characteristics of ad hon network traffic has not be done yet. I
think such studies should be done first, Before this kind of
assumption is made.
