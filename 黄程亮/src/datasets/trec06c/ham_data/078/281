Hello,

My name is Pat Schweihofer and I am going to be facilitating Lesson Study for the Lake Shore District.  We have been planning and putting a plan together .  If anyone has a format that works would you please send me the information.  My e-mail address is pschweihofer@lsps.org.  I am very thankful for any help that I may receive.

Dear Lesson Study Community,

As some of you might know, we currently maintain a database of lesson
study groups on our lesson study website
(www.tc.columbia.edu/lessonstudy). We would like this list to be as
comprehensive as possible, so that it can be a valuable resource for
the lesson study community.  If you are part of, or know of, a
lesson study group that is not listed on our website, we would greatly
appreciate it if you would let us know about this group.  Instructions
for how to do this are available on our website at:
http://www.tc.columbia.edu/lessonstudy/lsgroups.html .


Thank you!

Lesson Study Research Group
