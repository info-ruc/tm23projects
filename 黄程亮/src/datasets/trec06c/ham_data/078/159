Review of: "The design and implementation of an intentional naming
system," by W.A.Winoto, E.Schwartz, H.Balakrishnan, and J. Lilley

Panagiotis Papadimitratos papadp@ece.cornell.edu

The proposed architecture falls in the group of works that intend to
decouple names from object locations, and a system for resource
discovery
and service location is presented. The Intentional Naming System (INS)
functionality is implemented by the Intentional Name Resolvers (INR's)
that request and discover services and provide the corresponding data to
the querying application/client.

The INR's form an overlaid network, i.e., a virtual topology above the
actual network-layer topology, exchange and forward service
advertisements
and locally cache such descriptions. The entire system relies on
attribute-value pairs organized into 'Name-Tree' structures, which INR's
look up into. When a 'name specifier' arrives at an INR the look-up
returns the the IP address of the advertiser(s) of the sought
resource/service. The lookup algorithm is one of the technical
challenges of this work, and is experimentally evaluated.  

The operation of the system assumes the presence of an entity (DSR) that
maintains the list of all INR's present in the network. A new INR
contacts DSR (Domain space resolver) in order to acquire this
information and then establishes links with the rest of the INR's in
order to form the necessary connectivity. The apparent need for
proactiveness clearly impedes the scalability of the scheme, especially
in a dynamically changing environment, and the authors propose the
partitioning of the name space into domains, i.e., virtual spaces. 

In any case, the INR's have to make routing decisions at the level of
the overlaid network, this done at the publication of the paper with a
local construction of a spanning tree. The use of DBF is mentioned also
as an alternative. The amount of the overhead maybe significant, while
the goal of optimality is not clearly supported, especially because of
the apparent independence of routing decisions at the INS and network
layer. There is also the 'paradoxical' result that the lookup delay is
higher if two INR's reside at the same node.
