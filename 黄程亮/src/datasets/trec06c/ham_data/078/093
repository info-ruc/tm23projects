This paper tries to simplify the results obtained in the earlier Gupta
paper on capacity, in context of 802.11 and different traffic patterns.
They show how the expected bandwidth isn't as bad as predicted by Gupta et
al. as long as the traffic patterns are predominantly local.

The paper was very clear, and had an excellent example of how inteference
can affect the throughput of wireless networks.  They also took into
account how the 802.11 backoff scheme, and rts/cts signalling affects
throughput.
