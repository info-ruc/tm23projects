Performance Comparison of Two On-Demand Routing Protocols for
Ad Hoc Networks
Charles E.Perkins,Elizabeth M.Royer,Samir R.Das and Mahesh K.Marina.


the main differences of these two algorithms are:
1. DSR can grab more route info for each requet-reply cycle than
aodv and rhus tends to have less route discovery. 
2. destination replies all the requests from differnet paths for DSR
while AODV just replies once.
3.cache pollution is main problem of DSR while the TTL machanism may
expire valid routes.
4.AODV propagates errors to all the nodes using the broken links while
DSR just backs the packets to the upstream nodes.

the authors have done a much more thouroughly study for these two 
algorithms than previous one. some interesting and important results
are summarized here.

1. DSR has less routing overhead than AODV. this mainly come from the 
optimizations of DSR such as caching, promiscuous propagation and the 
fact that source node gets all the routes for intermediate nodes in 
addition to the destination nodes. all these make DSR have less routing
overhead.

2. but for MAC overhead, AODV tends has less overhead than DSR because
MAC layer deal with RREQ and RREP and REER int the differnt way.
broadcast
does not involve RTS/CTS.  so i think the concept of MAC overhead is one

of  main contributions of this paper. this metric is more accurate than 
routing overhead in the term of considering power consumtion and
bandwidth
effeciency.


3. lack of load balancing can result in the long latency. this is
reflected
when the network has less mobility and more data sources. both
algorithms 
suffered.

4. the trend is that AODV has smaller latency and much higer packet
delivery 
ratio than DSR in the case of higher mobility and more nodes and
sources.
this stems from the high possibility of DSR's cache pollution and more
collision at MAC layer because of the multiple replies.  while onthe
other hand in the lower mobility environment, the timer mechanism can
cause DSDV expire valid route and link failure caused by congestion can
be tolerated by DSR because of its abandunt route infomation and
salvaging mechanism in the intermediate nodes.

5. as indicated in the previous paper, the DSR tends to have shorter
paths. This fact has two sides effect. in the congestion, DSR tends to
make thing worse. so load balancing is necessary in the hot spot
scenario.

in the summary, i like this paper much better than the previous one
because it really covers more scenario so that giving us a more complete
results.it also explained the deep reasons which is definitely useful
for future algorithm  development.  further, some new metrics are used
which can reflect more practical performance of the routing algorithms.
