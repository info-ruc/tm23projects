Intentional naming system:

This paper discusses the design and implementation of the Intentional
Naming System (INS), which is a resource discovery and service
location system for mobile networks.  The goals of such a system is to
be able to describe and make requests based on types of services,
respond to network connectivity changes, fault-tolerant, and
configurable.  Applications use the INS language to describe the
services they are looking for and it is up to INS to find out where
these services are and if they are available.  To do this INS utilizes
a late binding mechanism that integrates name resolution and message
routing.

INS supports three types of resource resolution:  early binding with
IP addresses, late binding with intentional anycast and intentional
multicast.  They present an algorithm for efficient name lookups in
this environment.

INS provides a practical way for applications to keep track of
services in a dynamic network environment.  Motivation for
implementing this type of system, though, is weak and they did not
really provide a lot of inspiration for doing so, other than the fact
that it is technically feasible.
