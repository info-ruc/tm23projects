Freenet is a peer-to-peer network application that provides anonymity to
data sharing.  Data is distributed and dynamically replicated depending on
demand. Each file is identified by a key which is generated by hashing its
descriptive name, another key for the file's personal namespace, and a
content key based on hashing the entire file's content.

The files cluster based on the similarity of the generated hash.
Naturally, this precludes any type of semantic clustering, possibly
obviating any type of locality in data references.  Then again, it
also makes the system more distributed, because related data won't
be clustered around a single point of failure.

The node specialization could be a drawback -- it sort of contradicts the
authors argument that all nodes are equal; it's more of a constitutional
"all nodes are created equal" and after that they become more diverse.  A
very specialized node dropping out could result in a lot of aimless
network behavior until the routing tables get updated.

I also wonder how one can do meta-data searches, since files are only
identified by hashes based on the name. It seems you would need some sort
of centralized directory of plaintext names of files in order to know what
exactly is available on the network.
