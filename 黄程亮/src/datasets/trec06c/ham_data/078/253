Both of these projects at Berkeley deal with the design of wireless 
communication systems for distrbuting data over sensor networks.  They 
focus on the design of small electronic systems that strive for longevity 
and functionality.

Smartdust strives to show that a complete sensor network can be 
integrated into a cubic millimeter package.  Each one of the "dusts" can 
communicate on some kind of wireless plane, whether it be using rf 
frequencies or other laser pointer devices.  Using a laser device, the 
team was able to communicate over a 21km area (that had line of sight).

The TinyOS group is an event based operating environment that supports 
threads and event driven state machines.  They use a form of active 
messages to communicate between the nodes and establish a tree based on 
some sort of "base station" node.

I thought they had some interesting applications, such as the 
standard sensor network to detect vehicles, which was cool because
it was deployed by an unmanned air-vehicle.  I also thought that the 
"keyboard glove" was an interesting application for a sensor network.

The batter life for the sensors ranged from 72 hours (if it listened 
all the time) on up, depending on the amount of time they spent actually 
listening.  I would be curious to see more traffic patterns and how they 
could be distributed so as to lengthen the longevity of the system.

I would also be interested in seeing applications of the motes in sensor 
networks dealing with heterogeneous communication mediums.
