TinyOS and Sensor Dust
 
The small size of sensor devices have made the deployment of sensor
networks feasible.  However, these networks are characterized by nodes
with limited battery power, bandwodth, computation and storage.
Traditional communication hardware and protocols are not constrained by
power and bandwidth, nor by communication and storage.   Therefore an
efficient sensor network would require a completely new architecture
with a rebuild on the communication stack.  Research at UC Berkeley has
focussed on these two problems: TinyOS attacks the problem in software
trying to optimize code and protocols to be power and bandwidth
efficient, and smart dust approaches the same problems in hardware.
 
Smart Dust proposes a new look at the hardware for sensor networks,
including an optical communication scheme.  Reflectors are used to
reduce the energy concuption.  However, an optical communication would
require line of sight reachability among sensor nodes.  Overall, the
approaches proposed are fascinating.  They highlight the fact that
traditional RF communication schemes are expensive and alternate schemes
should be explored.
 
TinyOS looks at the communication stack for sensor devices, and tries to
rebuild the software and protocols for efficiency.  A new MAC protocol
is proposed for sensor devices.  This MAC is specialized CSMA when the
traffic pattern is correlated.  An adaptive rate control scheme is
proposed to reduce the number of collisions.  Further, the
RTS/CTS/DATA/ACK scheme is modified, so that ACKs are not explicitly
needed.  Since the data will be forwarded, ACKs are assumed to be free
by listening in promiscuous mode.   Another novel idea in TinyOS is the
use of Active Messages to reduce the energy consumption.  This could be
used for overlap of computation and communication.  The event-driven
nature of TinyOS could be used to conserve energy.
