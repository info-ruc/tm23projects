31) Semantic File Systems

This paper presents the Semantic File System which the authors believe is
more efficient than the traditional tree-structured file systems. The
authors use the attribute-value pair naming scheme which provides the
user flexible and easy searching of desired files.

Files stored in a Semantic File System are interpreted by file type
specific transducers to produce a set of attributes that facilitate later
retrieval of the file. Transducers are maintained for each file, which
can be specified by the users. Transducers identify the attribute-value
pairs for a file which can later be used for file searching. The name,
consisting of the attribute value pair, that a user specifies at the time
of searching is translated into a tree. The file is accessed using the
standard file system interface. Virtual links can be used to associate a
file in multiple virtual directories.

The Semantic File System aims to help a user organize his files more
efficiently, based on the content of the files using the attribute-value
pairs. This idea has been used in many systems, including the Intentional
Naming System. However, as the authors point out, the implementation of
real time indexing may require substantial amount of computing power at
the semantic file server. This may hinder the latency of such a system.
