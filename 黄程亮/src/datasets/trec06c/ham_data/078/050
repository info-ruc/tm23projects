This paper compares four ad hoc network routing protocols - DSDV, TORA,
DSR and AODV. They extended the ns-2 network simulator to model the MAC
and physical layer of IEEE 802.11 and wireless transmission channel.
And they presented a detailed packet level simulation result for 50
mobile nodes.

They performed the simulations with two different node nobilities -
a maximum speed of 20 m/s and 1 m/s. The followings are interesting
observations.

For 20 m/s;
1. DSR and AODV show better performance than TORA and DSDV, especially
   in higher mobility. 
2. DSDV fails to converge at pause times less than 300 seconds. It is 
   mainly because of a stale routing table entry.
3. TORA shows bad performance for 30 sources. It is due to congestion.
4. DSR shows better performance than AODV even in higher mobility.
   This is contradict with the result of another paper I have reviewed
   this week.
5. DSR has the least overhead and TORA has the most. AODV and DSDV cross
   as mobility changes. AODV is better in lower mobility and DSDV in
   higher.   
6. DSR and AODV shows almost same shape of curves, because they both use 
   on-demand and similar mechanisms.
7. The overhead of DSDV does not change with respect to mobility, because
   it is periodic routing protocol. But the overhead of the others decrease
   as mobility gets lower.
8. DSR and DSDV find the shortest path effectively. But AODV and TORA
   have a significant tail up to 4 or more hops longer.

For 1 m/s;
1. DSDV converges in this case.
2. TORA shows a strange curve, which is not explained in this paper.
3. DSR and AODV show much lower protocol overhead than DSDV and TORA,
   due to their on-demand characteristic.

Generally, DSR shows best performance and AODV is almost as good as DSR.
DSDV and TORA are worse than the above two. However, this paper does not
say this fact definitly, because this is just a case study.

I think, the fairness is the most important in this kind of study, and 
in that sense, this paper did good work. They analyzed the protocols
very carefully and implemented them in detail, even with help from the
designers of each protocol. They also modeled lower layers accurately
, which usually has not been done in other papers. The simulation settings
and metrics were also well defined. Overally, this paper gives credibility
to readers.

I think, the simulation size is not so practical - 50 nodes, 1500mX300m
space and 900 second simulation time. This might reflect some situations
such as wireless notebook networks inside a library. But it is not a 
suitable model for situations such as battle field and sensor networks.
In addition, DSR might have more overhead than the other protocols as
the networks scale up. So, we need to be careful in comparing the protocols.

This paper is excellent in comparing the protocols. But, it will be good
to propose new ideas based on this study. I think there might have been
following papers after this.
