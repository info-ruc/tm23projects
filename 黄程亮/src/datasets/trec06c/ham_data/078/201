Overview

   There  are  multiple vulnerabilities in several implementations of the
   line  printer  daemon  (lpd).  The line printer daemon enables various
   clients to share printers over a network. Review your configuration to
   be  sure  you have applied all relevant patches. We also encourage you
   to restrict access to the lpd service to only authorized users.

I. Description

   There  are  multiple vulnerabilities in several implementations of the
   line  printer  daemon  (lpd), affecting several systems. Some of these
   problems  have been publicly disclosed previously. However, we believe
   many system and network administrators may have overlooked one or more
   of  these  vulnerabilities.  We are issuing this document primarily to
   encourage  system and network administators to check their systems for
   exposure to each of these vulnerabilities, even if they have addressed
   some lpd vulnerabilities recently.

   Most  of  these vulnerabilities are buffer overflows allowing a remote
   intruder  to  gain  root  access to the lpd server. For the latest and
   most  detailed information about the known vulnerabilities, please see
   the vulnerability notes linked to below.

 VU#274043 - BSD line printer daemon buffer overflow in displayq()

   There is a buffer overflow in several implementations of in.lpd, a BSD
   line  printer  daemon.  An intruder can send a specially crafted print
   job  to  the  target  and then request a display of the print queue to
   trigger  the  buffer  overflow.  The  intruder  may  be  able use this
   overflow  to  execute  arbitrary commands on the system with superuser
   privileges.

   The  line  printer  daemon  must be enabled and configured properly in
   order for an intruder to exploit this vulnerability. This is, however,
   trivial  as  the  line  printer  daemon is commonly enabled to provide
   printing  functionality.  In order to exploit the buffer overflow, the
   intruder  must  launch  his attack from a system that is listed in the
   "/etc/hosts.equiv" or "/etc/hosts.lpd" file of the target system.

 VU#388183   -   IBM   AIX  line  printer  daemon  buffer  overflow  in
                 kill_print()

   A  buffer  overflow  exists  in  the kill_print() function of the line
   printer  daemon  (lpd)  on AIX systems. An intruder could exploit this
   vulnerability  to obtain root privileges or cause a denial of service
   (DoS).   The  intruder  would  need  to  be  listed  in  the  victim's
   /etc/hosts.lpd  or  /etc/hosts.equiv  file,  however,  to exploit this
   vulnerability.

 VU#722143   -   IBM   AIX  line  printer  daemon  buffer  overflow  in
                 send_status()

   A  buffer  overflow  exists  in the send_status() function of the line
   printer  daemon  (lpd)  on AIX systems. An intruder could exploit this
   vulnerability  to  obtain root privileges or cause a denial of service
   (DoS).   The  intruder  would  need  to  be  listed  in  the  victim's
   /etc/hosts.lpd  or  /etc/hosts.equiv  file,  however,  to exploit this
   vulnerability.

 VU#466239 - IBM AIX line printer daemon buffer overflow in chk_fhost()

   A  buffer  overflow  exists  in  the  chk_fhost() function of the line
   printer  daemon  (lpd)  on AIX systems. An intruder could exploit this
   vulnerability  to  obtain root privileges or cause a denial of service
   (DoS).  The  intruder  would need control of the DNS server to exploit
   this vulnerability.

 VU#39001 - line printer daemon allows options to be passed to sendmail

   There  exists  a vulnerability in the line printer daemon that permits
   an  intruder  to send options to sendmail. These options could be used
   to  specify  another  configuration  file allowing an intruder to gain
   root access.

 VU#30308  -  line printer daemon hostname authentication bypassed with
              spoofed DNS

   A  vulnerability  exists in the line printer daemon (lpd) shipped with
   the printer package for several systems. The authentication method was
   not  thorough  enough.  If a remote user was able to control their own
   DNS  so  that  their  IP address resolved to the hostname of the print
   server, access would be granted when it should not be.

 VU#966075 - Hewlett-Packard HP-UX line printer daemon buffer overflow

   A  buffer  overflow  exists in HP-UX's line printer daemon (rlpdaemon)
   that  may  allow  an intruder to execute arbitrary code with superuser
   privilege  on the target system. The rlpdaemon is installed by default
   and  is active even if it is not being used. An intruder does not need
   any  prior  knowledge,  or privileges on the target system, in order to
   exploit this vulnerability.

II. Impact

   All of these vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely. In most cases,
   they  allow  an intruder to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
   of  the  lpd  server. In some cases, an intruder must have access to a
   machine  listed  in  /etc/hosts.equiv  or  /etc/hosts.lpd, and in some
   cases, an intruder must be able to control a nameserver.

   One vulnerability (VU#39001) allows you to specify options to sendmail
   that  can  be  used  to  execute arbitrary commands.  Ordinarily, this
   vulnerability is only exploitable from machines that are authorized to
   use the lpd server. However, in conjunction with another vulnerability
   (VU#30308), permitting  intruders  to  gain access to the lpd service,
   this vulnerability can be used by intruders not normally authorized to
   use the lpd service.

   For   specific   information  about  the  impacts  of  each  of  these
   vulnerabilities,  please consult the CERT Vulnerability Notes Database
   (http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls).

III. Solution

Apply a patch from your vendor

   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
   Please contact your vendor directly.

   This  table  represents  the status of each vendor with regard to each
   vulnerability. Please be aware that vendors produce multiple products;
   if they are listed in this table, not all products may be affected. If
   a vendor is not listed in the table below, then their status should be
   considered  unknown. For specific information about the status of each
   of  these vulnerabilities, please consult the CERT Vulnerability Notes
   Database (http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls).

Restrict access to the lpd service

   As  a  general  practice, we recommend disabling all services that are
   not  explicitly  required.  You  may  wish to disable the line printer
   daemon if there is not a patch available from your vendor.

   If  you  cannot  disable  the  service, you can limit your exposure to
   these vulnerabilities by using a router or firewall to restrict access
   to port 515/TCP (printer). Note that this does not protect you against
   attackers from within your network.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
   comments.

Apple Computer, Inc.

   Mac  OS  X  does not have the line printer daemon vulnerability issues
   described in these advisories.

Berkeley Software Design, Inc. (BSDI)

   Some  (older)  versions are affected. The current (BSD/OS 4.2) release
   is  not  vulnerable.  Systems are only vulnerable to attack from hosts
   which  are  allowed  via  the  /etc/hosts.lpd  file (which is empty as
   shipped).
   BSD/OS  4.1  is  the only vulnerable version which is still officially
   supported  by  Wind  River Systems. A patch (M410-044) is available in
   the  normal  locations, ftp://ftp.bsdi.com/bsdi/patches or via our web
   site at http://www.bsdi.com/support

Compaq

   Compaq  has not been able to reproduce the problems identified in this
   advisory  for TRU64 UNIX. We will continue testing and address the LPD
   issues if a problem is discovered and provide patches as necessary.

Cray

   Cray,  Inc. has been unable to prove an lpd vulnerability. However, it
   was  deemed  that a buffer overflow may be possible and so did tighten
   up the code. See Cray SPR 721101 for more details.
