The Intentional Naming Service (INS) for resource discovery uses a simple 
language to associate descriptive attributes and values to services in the 
network. Intentional name resolvers (INRs) match clients desiring a service to 
the appropriate service based on the attributes and perform the routing to the 
destination service. INRs form a spanning tree and update each other 
periodically to support large networks of resources.

Intentional names describe services using name-specifiers consisting of 
attributes and values forming an av-pairs. INRs maintain mappings between 
intentional names and network locations in the form of IP addresses. An INR 
supports node mobility and allows IP addresses to change, and will also react 
to load changes which might cause it to choose a different service location. 
Clients use intentional names to request services, and are oblivious to who is 
providing the service and changes in mapping due to mobility. Clients can 
request late-binding so that the binding to a location is made at message 
delivery time. From this, a client can request an intentional-anycast, so that 
the location of service is chosen by the optimality of an application-
controlled metric. Intentional-multicast delivers to all locations. INRs send 
periodic and triggered messages to each other to keep information fresh and are 
capable of performing load balancing. Some applications of INS include 
Floorplan which provides users with an up-to-date map of their current 
location. Camera allows a user to ask for images from specific cameras, or can 
use intentional multicast to query all the cameras in an area. 

INS works well to respond quickly and distribute workload amongst the INRs. INS 
appears to successfully achieve its goals of expressiveness, responsiveness, 
robustness and ease of configuration for its naming system. Since it works over 
IP unicast, it could easily be integrated into existing networks. I think the 
main contribution of multicast is that it combines routing and naming and 
employs application-level information to effectively provide resource discovery 
in large networks. It employs DBF shortest path routing, which could be 
replaced with other routing techniques, and therefore could possibly 
accommodate ad hoc routing.
