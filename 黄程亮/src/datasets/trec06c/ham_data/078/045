multi-hop performance:

This paper discusses the relative performance of four multi-hop
wireless ad hoc network protocols (DSDV, TORA, DSR, AODV).  This is
essentially a simulation paper and no new protocols or protocol
optimizations are introduced.

They do a detailed packet-level simulation of the various protocols
and apparently make a good attempt at fixing the problems with the
ns-2 simulator and making it produce accurate simulations for wireless
networks.  They do this by adding MAC and physical-layer models of the
IEEE 802.11 standard, as well as an accurate wireless channel model.

In general, the authors found that DSR performed better than the other
protocols in most of the metrics that this paper examined.  The other
protocols perform as follows: AODV, DSDV, and then TORA (in order of
decreasing performance).  This performance (of course) depends on
their particular simulation setup and such, but I feel that their
simulation approach was rather robust and was realistic for actual ad
hoc networks.
