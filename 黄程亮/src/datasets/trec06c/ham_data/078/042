25) A Performance Comparison of Multi-Hop Wireless Ad Hoc Network
    Routing Protocols

This paper presents a unified simulation study of several ad-hoc
routing protocols. They present results for DSDV, TORA, DSR and AODV
in a unified simulation environment under ns-2 which attempts to
accurately model the 802.11 wireless standard. They implemented the 4
protocols on top of ns-2 with help from the authors, and attempted to
be fair between the different implementations of the protocols in
their environment by evaluating how the real world parameters would
affect the protocol negatively-- such as in AODV presenting an
implementation that reduces control overhead by only noticing link
breakages from the link layer, and not periodic broadcast messages.

They present the simulations of 50 wireless nodes in a rectangular
space. This is the second time we've seen a rectangular simulation
space; it's rectangular to force longer routes between nodes than
would occur normally in a square simulation space. They use the random
way point model, which is characterized by each node picking a
destination and a speed, and moving towards that destination and
pausing for a certain amount of time before repeating.To ensure that
the study was comparable between protocols, they generated 70 movement
patterns and 4 communication patterns for 210 total scenarios that
each routing protocol was tested on. They do not claim that these
simulations accurately reflect the real world, mearly that since the
protocols are all simulated in the same environment it is fair to make
conclusions about their behaviours in these simulations.

They present results for goodput, control overhead, and path
optmimality for the different communication patterns (which reflect
the number of transmission sources.) They have good insightful
details, and their work seems to agree with current beliefs on the
effectiveness of protocols (for example, DSDV, being a proactive
protocol, has many problems stabilizing under periods of high motion,
although it has a constant amount of control overhead.) This is
definitely a reference paper for any future simulation study
comparison.
