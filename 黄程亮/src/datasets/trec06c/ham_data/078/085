This paper further elaborates on the capacity on ad hoc wireless
networks.  Specifically, they look at how the traffic pattern determines
the capacity of ad hoc networks, and indicated that large ad hoc networks
are feasible if most of the communication is local.

The first investigation this paper undertakes is the capacity of
"chained" nodes, where each node is not mobile.  They show that because a
node's ability to send in 802.11 is affected by the amount of competition
it experiences - a node can inject more packets into an network than the
subsequent nodes can forward, and they get dropped as a result.  

The paper also considers how 802.11's back off performs poorly - They
mention that a node may exponentially back off one of its timers when a
RTS packet is corrupted by a hidden terminal.

Next their analysis turns to lattice networks (ie chains but with 2
dimensions), and find the same problems as in the chain networks.  They
then evaluate how these results carry over into a graph with random
traffic and random layout, where they determine that the capacity
available to each node is explicitly dependent on the expected path
length.  They then find that with either bounded paths lengths or
probabilistically short paths, ad hoc networks do not have unrealistically
low capacity.

comments:
I would like to see some analysis in mobile environments, but I think that
using a static network provides a good upper bound, and I thought it was
a key insight that capacity depends on the locality of communication.
