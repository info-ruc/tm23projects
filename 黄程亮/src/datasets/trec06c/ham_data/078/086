Li, Blake, De Couto, Lee, Morris:

This paper discuses the capacity of ad hoc wireless networks.  It
mainly examines the interactions of the MAC layer with ad hoc
forwarding.  The authors use simluation and analysis from first
principles to examine the capacitance of ad hoc networks depending on
the network size, traffic  patterns, and radio interactions.

They present results analyzing the per node capacity as an ad hoc
network scales.  It turns out that the average distance between source
and destination nodes must remain small as the network increases in
size, in order for the total network capacity to grow.

The 802.11 MAC layer acheives 1/7 of the raw channel bandwidth of a
long chain of nodes, whereas in theory 1/4 of the raw channel
bandwidth is possible.  802.11 is more efficient at routing orderly
local traffic patterns and approaches the theoreticaly capacity per
node in large random networks (which is slightly puzzling to me, given
the first assertion in this sentence).  The key thing for the
feasibility of large ad hoc networks is the locality of traffic.
