46) Capacity of Ad Hoc Wireless Networks

This work presents a highly theoretical and math oriented analysis of
the overall capacity of wireless networks. They analyze so called
'arbitrary' networks where nodes are randomly located in a disk of
unit area in the plane and have an arbitrary destination to which they
wish to send traffic at an arbitrary rate. They analyze situations in
terms of the protocol model and the physical model, which are models
for successful reception of a packet from a source to a
destination. The protocol model simply says that the packet is
received if the distance between source and destination is smaller
than any other source sending to this destination, the packet is
received. The physical model more closely models the physical layer
and is represented by a distance fall off equation for the signal
strength. Any signal received above a threshold is received.

They show that under the protocol model, if each node has a
transmission capacity of W, and all nodes are optimally places, the
traffic pattern is optimal, and the range of transmission is optimal,
a throughput of O(W\sqrt{n}) is achievable. They present the insight
that wireless networks throughput decreases with the number of nodes
if the communication distance increases with the number of nodes,
therefore it is crucial to scalability to limit the number of hops
communication must travel as the network grows. They also note that
adding pure relay nodes to the network doesn't make the problem any
better, as kn relays are added to the network, the throughput of the
network only increases \sqrt{k+1} fold.

This paper presents strong arguments that highly scalable ad-hoc
networks are likely only possible given short communication distances
and therefore compel routing algorithms to utilize this fact in
improving protocols, as information about distant hosts is unlikely to
be used in a successful large ad-hoc network.
