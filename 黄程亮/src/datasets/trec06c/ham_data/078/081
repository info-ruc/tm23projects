Review of "Capacity of Ad Hoc Wireless Networks," by J. Li, R. Morris et
al. 

papadp@ece.cornell.edu Panagiotis Papadimtratos

The authors examine the limitations imposed on ad hoc multihop topologies
due to the use of a shared channel. They investigate the forwarding
capability of a 802.11-based MANET without the presence of a routing
protocol, which would simply impose additional tranmsission overhead. If
the packet size of all traffic is assumed the same, then the presence of a
routing protocol does not have a qualitative impact.

First, a detailed study of the interactions between node transmissions is
provided, over different types of topologies. The coupling of concurrent
transmissions is shown through simulations for three different topologies:
chain, sets of vertical/horizontal chains and grid. The theoreticaly
(given the coupling) maximum throughput is not achieved by 802.11 under
uniform load conditions. Nonetheless, it is approached when the pattern is
randomized. 

This is the main contribution of this work: they provide an upper bound
that incorporates the effect of the communication pattern on capacity,
i.e., the achieved transmission rate per node. Their formulation under
some assumptions matches the upper bound given by [Kumar] but with an
arbitrary pdf (i.e., non uniform) modeling the communiation pattern, they
indicate that the highest achievable throughput can exceed the
O(1/sqrt(n)) bound. This is due to the locality of communication, and the
reduced average path length leads to the increased achievable througput.

An interesting point (not very well-supported though) is that the
'shortest path routing' (e.g., min-hop, or geographcal routing) is in
accordance with the upper bound formulation, which seems to me that it
brings route optimality back into the game.
