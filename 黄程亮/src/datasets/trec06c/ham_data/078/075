Capacity of Ad Hoc Wireless Networks

Jinyang Li, Charles Blake, Douglas S.J. De Couto, Hu Imm Lee, Robert
Morris

	This paper aims to address the capacity in the ad hoc wireless
networks. An a priori key assumption made is that the ad hoc network,
although dynamic in nature, can be viewed as static when evaluating its
capacity, since in most scenarios, nodes do not travel significant
distances during packet transmissions. Although this assumption can be
justified in this paper, not all scenarios of ad-hoc mobile networks may
fit this criterion. Throughout the evaluations of ad hoc network capacity,
the measurements are benchmarked against the single-hop throughput. 

	Several conclusions are drawn from the analysis of ad hoc network
capacity:

	1)802.11 MAC is capable of sending at the optimal rate, but does
not discover the optimum schedule of transmissions on its own. This
inability is caused by the amount of competition the sender experiences,
which prevents it from injecting more packets into the network.
	2)An ideal ad hoc forwarding chain (i.e., a chain of forwarding
nodes along the path) should be able to achieve one quarter of the
throughput that a single-hop transmission can achieve. But the 802.11 MAC
protocol is able to handle only one-seventh of the single-hop throughput.
	3)When the network nodes are in an orderly fashion, carrying
orderly traffic patterns, the 802.11 MAC protocol is more efficient, and
the per-hope throughput remains relatively constant. On the other hand, in
an environment of random node placement and random traffic pattern, as the
path length increases, the bandwidth available for each node to originate
packets decreases. 

	One contribution given in the paper is that is provides a
mathematical formula to calculate the expected path length between any
source-destination pair in an ad hoc network. This length is influenced by
two parameters: the locality index and the total area of the network
coverage. This formula may be helpful in assisting the network designer to
assess the optimal nodal placement and density in an ad hoc network.
