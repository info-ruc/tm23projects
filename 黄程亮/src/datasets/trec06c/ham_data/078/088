Capacity of Wireless Networks.

This paper evaluates a theoretical limit on the capacity of adhoc
wireless networks. Two models are assumed: the arbitrary and random, but
both in a static setting. The efficacy of MAC forwarding and 802.11
routing is evaluated under a horizontal flow and both horizontal and
vertical grid flow model, thus establishing a upper and lower bound on
the throughput possible and what kind of scheduling would enable this.

Some results:
a. 802.11 can send at the optimum rate but cannot find the right
schedule.
b. Throughput for a single chain is 1/7 insteafd of the expected 1/4.
c. Increase in path length decreases available bandwidth.

I think that since the paper was entirely theoretical, the authors have
done a good job defining the upper and lower limits. However since my
knowledge as to the basis of the assumpotions in these evaluations is
limited, the only queries that I have are:

a. Static model: It would be interesting to know why the paper takes
this assumption and why could'nt a mobility model have been strapped
onto these evaluations.
b. There are horizontal and vertical chains that were considered for
this study. Why could'nt any other model be chosen?
