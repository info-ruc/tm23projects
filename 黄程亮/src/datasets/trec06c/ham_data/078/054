This paper presents a detailed simulation study of two on-demand routing 
protocols, AODV and DSR, with accurate MAC and physical layer models. These 
protocols were evaluated in terms of packet delivery fraction, received 
throughput in kilobits per second, average end-to-end delay, normalized routing 
load as well as normalized MAC load. Again, ns-2 was used which models 802.11 
network characteristics.

Many results are presented, but the general trend is that AODV performs better 
in high traffic and high load (‘stressful’) situations, while DSR outperforms 
in low traffic and low load (‘less stressful’) situations. More specifically, 
DSR has significantly worse packet delivery in high load or high mobility 
situations, although DSR and AODV have comparable packet delivery otherwise. 
Delay in DSR is also much higher than AODV in high mobility, although it is 
slightly less in slow-moving environments. This is an interesting result since 
DSR focuses on routes with least number of hops, while AODV tends to choose the 
least congested route. We can see from this result that the shortest route does 
not imply the least delay. DSR always incurs less routing overhead while 
frequently incurring higher MAC overhead except in low mobility. 

The reason that DSR performs poorly in high mobility is because it aggressively 
uses cached information to find new routes when the current route is broken. 
When topology is changing quickly, the cached route information becomes stale 
but continues to be used temporarily and even gets propagated to nodes 
listening in promiscuous mode. An improvement would be to determine an expiry 
time for cached information. The cached alternate routes improve DSR 
performance in low mobility situations when the cached routes remain valid for 
longer. The increased MAC overhead in DSR is due to frequent use of unicast, as 
opposed to broadcast, which is more costly at the MAC layer due to use of 
RTS/CTS/Data/ACK exchanges. AODV has more routing overhead because it generates 
many more RREQs and essentially floods the network when discovering a route.

This paper provides useful MAC layer performance analysis, which is often 
neglected in the study of routing protocols. It is clear that routing protocol 
performance is highly dependent on its interaction with lower layers, which has 
not been optimized in on-demand protocols. One critique would be that although 
AODV delivers more packets than DSR in stressful environments, its packet 
delivery ratio is by no means considered sufficient performance for proper 
operation. Also, unicast is more costly than broadcast at the MAC layer, yet 
more reliable and I’m surprised that it was not more evident in the simulation 
results (i.e. affects on packet loss and collisions?).
