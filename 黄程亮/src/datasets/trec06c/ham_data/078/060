This paper, entitled "A Performance Comparison of Multi-Hop Wireless Ad 
Hoc Network Routing Protocols," extends a standard network simulator to 
look at a few ad hoc networking protocols on level playing field.

The monarch group uses ns, a discrete event simulator, and modifies it to 
support multi-hope wireless networks.  They add a wireless mac layer, arp, 
and link modeling to the simulator.  Each node has a packet buffer and 
one network interface.

The paper presents simulations for DSDV, TORA, DSR, and AODV.  They use 
a 50 node, 1500m by 300m space and run the simulation for 900 seconds.  
While they admit this may not accurately reflect real-world conditions, 
this is at least a place to start comparisons between the protocols.

In the simulation results, it is interesting to see that DSR and AODV-LL 
deliver a good number of the packets (95-100%) independently with the 
packet load.    DSDV and TORA perform bad in high mobility situations 
compared to DSR and OADV, and TORA fails to deliver a high percentage of 
the packets sent with larger networks.

Another interesting graph was the routing overhead in terms of packets 
and bytes sent over the network - obviously, dsr had fewer packets sent 
out than aodv, but aodv performed better when overhead was measured by 
bytes over the network, except with extremely high nodes.  

Overall, this paper was an interesting comparison between the protocols, 
and did not show any surprising results, although it did show that aodv 
has more network overhead at high mobility rates, which is a little 
counter intuitive.
