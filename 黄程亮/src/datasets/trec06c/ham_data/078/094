Gupta & Kumar:

This paper also discusses the capacity of wireless networks.  It is a
theory paper and quite frankly way too verbose and the writing style
was almost unbearable.

They show that every node in an ad hoc network must share channels
with local neighbors in order for the total network capacity to be
utilized.  The throughput available to users tends towards zero as the
number of users is increased, they suggest some type of clustering (i
think) might be useful for maintaining throughput for users.

They suggest that wireless networks may only be beneficial for
networks with a small number of nodes--not very encouraging i suppose
for ad hoc network visionaries.  Adaptive or clustering may be able to
overcome this or help in scalability.

Essentially this paper said that ad hoc networks in their current
implementation are limited and more complex schemes are needed in
order for ad hoc networks to become practical.
