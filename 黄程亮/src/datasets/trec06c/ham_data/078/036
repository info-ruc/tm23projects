This is an excellent paper that unifies the simulation study of some of the 
major ad hoc routing protocols. It compares the performance of four ad hoc 
routing protocols: DSDV, TORA, DSR and AODV. Using a modified ns-2 network 
simulator, the authors create a simulation environment that supports realistic 
physical and MAC layers based on IEEE 802.11 standards (including DCF and ARP) 
while modeling signal attenuation to determine delays between nodes and 
received power levels. From the received power level, the physical layer 
decides whether the signal is noise, erroneous, or a successful packet and the 
MAC layer detects collisions.

The authors implemented some general improvements to the protocols: jitter 
between broadcasts to minimize collisions; priority of routing packets in the 
transmit queue to reduce route discovery delays; and breakage feedback at MAC 
layer to reduce packet dropping. Protocol specific improvements include: 
implementing DSDV-SQ that triggers updates with each new sequence number as 
opposed to new metric only; aggregating TORA and IMEP messages; using only bi-
directional links in DSR to support lower layers; and implementing AODV-LL to 
replace periodic HELLO messages. The protocols are tested for 210 different 
scenario files with 50 nodes, and with two different max speeds, 1m/s and 
20m/s, over which speed is uniformly distributed. The scenario files vary 
motion from continuous motion to no motion. Having 70 fixed movement patterns 
and using 10, 20 or 30 sources provides variation in traffic load. 3 metrics 
are used: packet delivery ratio over the simulation, routing overhead counting 
each hop, and path optimality as a difference of the chosen path from the 
shortest possible path. An additional study is done to include significance of 
header size in DSR. 

DSDV-SQ, the only proactive protocol under examination, had very poor packet 
delivery in high mobility, and exhibited constant overhead regardless of node 
movement. DSDV-SQ very frequently chose the optimal path. TORA may have 
delivered packets better than DSDV-SQ, but was still limited due to the 
occurrence of short-lived routing loops dropping packets, while suffering from 
very high overhead. TORA actually failed to converge in many high traffic cases 
due to unmanageable congestion. Also, TORA chose longer than optimal paths as 
mobility increased. DSR exhibited the best packet delivery ratio and the lowest 
overhead. AODV-LL also had good packet delivery but with high overhead due to 
flooding, particularly in high mobility. DSR and AODV-LL take advantage of 
previous route knowledge to decreases overall overhead and significant 
improvement can be seen when there are many (30) data sources. DSR effectively 
exploits caching and eavesdropping as well. After considering the additional 
header bytes in DSR, it was found that DSR incurs more overhead than AODV-LL in 
all but very high mobility cases. Further study must be performed, since 
control information added to existing packets is not as costly as control 
information being sent out in individual numerous packets.

DSR and AODV-LL perform the best and appear to support mobility well. But, I’m 
curious about the delay incurred by each of the protocols, since a large delay 
will invalidate other good performance characteristics. Results suggest that 
DSR would have less delay since it most often chooses the shortest path while 
AODV-LL does not. Aside from providing significant results, this paper 
addresses compatibility issues of routing protocols with the physical and link 
layer, and tests the true functionality of the protocols without making 
simplifying assumptions.
