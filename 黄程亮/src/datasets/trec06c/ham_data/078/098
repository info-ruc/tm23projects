This paper looked at the theoretical capacity limits of wireless networks 
without any centralized structure.  The evaluate the limitations of 
802.11 and find a theoretical upper limit for networks with arbitrarily 
and randomly located nodes and traffic patterns.

The most significant finding of this paper is that a wireless network 
modeled with no interference with nodes capable of transmitting at W 
bits/sec employing a common range, each with a randomly chose 
destination, is limited by the number of nodes proportional to 1/sqrt(nlogn).

The only real problem with this is that it probably doesn't model ad-hoc 
networks very well - it just provides a specific upper bound - I doubt 
any ad-hoc networking application has this communication pattern, and 
this is assuming that all nodes do not move.  Never the less, it does 
provide a limit for this particular setup.
