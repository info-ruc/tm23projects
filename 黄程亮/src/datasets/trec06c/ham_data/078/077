45) Capacity of Wireless Networks

This work inspects the surprisingly low performance and throughput of
wireless networks and attempts to put an upper bound on the throughput
of a wireless network. They investigate not only a theoretical upper
bound on performance, but also an empirical study to back up their
observations.

The first insight is that a single node can only send or receive at
one time, and only a single node in a transmission area can
communicate at a single time, effectively silencing all their
neighbors. So any optimal (collision free) network will exhibit the
optimal transmission scheduling algorithm where only one node
communicates in a given overhearing area. They also note that the
problem is even worse than that-- there is a range surrounding the
transmission area where anyone else transmitting will have their
packets corrupted by the original transmission. This only further
degrades the possible upper bound on throughput.

They examine chains of nodes relaying a source transmission, which is
the case in our ad-hoc networks where paths are multihop between
sender and receiver. A theoretical bound on the overall communication
throughput is 1/4 because of the observations earlier. They also show
that even this bound is overly optimistic because nodes at the ends of
the chains have less contention for the network than chains in the
middle, and the source at the end of the chain can transmit packets
much faster than the relays in the middle. A simple empirical
simulation puts this bound at about 1/7.

>From these observations, they move on to ideal node locations to
provide the highest throughput in a lattice and from there move to a
random node layout and a random traffic pattern. From these patterns,
they show that although 802.11 doesn't have the optimal scheduling
algorithm, it does do a reasonable job of scheduling packets for
transmission. They show that the key scalability problem with ad-hoc
networks is the locality of traffic, that as networks get larger,
paths between communicating nodes get larger, and more network
resources are utilized to deal with these communication channels,
hence more local traffic will allow ad-hoc networks to scale.
