A Performance Comparison of Multi-Hop Wireless Ad Hoc Network Routing
Protocols.
Josh Broch, David A. Maltz, David B. Johnson, Yih-Chun Hu, and Jorjeta
Jetcheva. 

the main contribution of this paper is to compare main routing
algorithms in the same environment for the first time. this will
illustrate the relative performance of different algorithms and helpful
for choosing a algorithm in the later real  implementation.

the paper extends the NS2 simulator in the term of physical layers and
MAC layer and compare four routing algorithms, DSDV, TORA, DSR and AODV.
the relatively more accurate physical link and MAC layer modeling is
another contribution of this paper.

the metric used by this paper is delivery ration, routing overhead, path
optimization. the latency is counted. further, the routing overhead only
counts the number of packets. the paper does not argue why different
length of packets does not make a big difference.

the result shows that
1. dsr and aodv has a stable and better packet delivery ratio while DSDV
can not converge when pause time less than 100s and TORA drops too many
packets when network has 30 data sources.

2. dsr has lest routing overhead because of its cahcing from forwarded
and promiscuously overhead packets and non-propagating request. DSDV is
a proactive protocol so it has constant overhead regardless of the node
mobility.

3.DSDV and DSR almost always use shortest path regardless of pause time
while TORA and AODV do this only at large pause time.

4. when counting the length of control packets, AODV has lest number
while DSR performs still better than the other two algorithms.

in a summary, though this paper gives us an idea how those algorithms
perform relatively. it is still hard to say some one is better than
others because of limited scenarios simulated by the paper. Just as
admitted in the paper, it not comparable between this paper and
Freisleben and Jansen's because of different speeds of nodes and number
of nodes.
