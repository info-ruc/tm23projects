Hi Janice,

Have you heard of The Math Forum's Bridging Research and Practice (BRAP)
Project?

As part of the BRAP project, American teachers designed a lesson together,
implemented the lesson in their classrooms, videotaped and shared those
tapes with the members of the BRAP group, reflected on what they saw
individually and collectively, and shared the videotapes and their thoughts
through the internet with other teachers and researchers:

http://mathforum.org/brap/wrap/

To learn more about the project and its goals, visit BRAP's web site:

http://mathforum.org/brap/

To read about some of the similarities between Lesson Study and the BRAP
project you can read my BRAP reflections here:

Hope this helps.
