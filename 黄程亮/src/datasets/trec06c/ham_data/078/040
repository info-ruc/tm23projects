A Performance Comparison of Multi-Hop Wireless Ad Hoc Network Routing
Protocols
Josh Bgroch, David A. Maltz, David B. Johnson, Yih-Chun Hu, and Jorjeta

This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis for four routing
algorithms in an ad hoc network, DSDV, TORA, DSR, and AODV. Of the four,
only DSDV is based on proactive routing scheme, whereas the others are all
of reactive-routing, which appears to be the general consensus in the ad
hoc research community. The authors go to painstaking details to define a
high-caliber simulation environment, generated by NS2. Not only is the
overall topology that applies to all four algorithms is defined, but
according to its unique characteristics, each algorithm is also tailored
with parameters to make it more realistic in practice. While running the
simulations, the authors have also made modifications to these algorithms
and reported improved performance. Three performance metrics are used for
the evaluations: 1)packet delivery ratio, 2)routing overhead, and 3)Path
optimality

The observations drawn from the evaluations are as follows:

1)AODV performs worse than DSR in terms of packet delivery ratio
regardless of the nodal mobility. This somewhat in contrast to the results
obtained in the paper by Perkins, Royer, and Das, where for high mobility
AODV is seen faring better than DSR.
2)For DSR and AODV, packet delivery ratio is independent of the offered
traffic load at various mobilities. Also, compared with the above two,
TORA, and especially DSDV, are not suitable for ad hoc networks with high
mobiliy.
3)Generally, with the exception of DSDV, the routing overhead increases as
the number of sources increases, the overhead tends to come down when
mobile nodes are less actively moving about in the network. 
 4)Figure 6 is intended to give a comparision of route optimality of the
four routing protocols. However, by looking at the graph, it does now show
a consistency in this regard (i.e., which routing protocol consistently
yields optimal routes).  

I think in choosing which routing algorithms to compare with, it is
important to distinguish between proactive routing and reactive
routing. In this paper, DSDV (proactive routing) is compared against the
performance of three reactive routing protocols. This may not be a fair
comparison, especially when it comes to measuring the overhead, as
proactive routing usually generates more overhead due to its aggressive
nature. Also, it seems to be the trend in the ad hoc research community
that reactive routing protocols are more favored than their proactive
routing counterparts. 

Also, since TORA is designed to react promptly to the dynamic change of
topology in the network, this reaction time ought to be measured as well
to see how it fares comparing the other routing algorithms. This
measurement will be very important as it may pave way for further research
on how to deal with the dynamics of the network topology to better assist
in the repair of a broken route or reconstruction of a new one should a
need arise.
