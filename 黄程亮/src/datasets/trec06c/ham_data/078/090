Scalability is a factor of network size, traffic patterns, local interaction 
and MAC layer interaction of the routing protocol. This paper addresses the 
effects of the MAC and routing layer interaction on ad hoc network capacity. It 
also determines the communication patterns that allow scalability. The authors 
consider a single shared channel and a static wireless network.

The authors determine the network capacity limited only by the 802.11 MAC layer 
contention through a chain of nodes. A chain of nodes has ultimate throughput 
1/3 since successive nodes must wait for each other to transmit, causing 
delays. Allowing interference further deteriorates performance due to 
collisions. Simulation results show even worse throughputs, down to 1/7 of 
1.7Mbps. This decrease in performance is due to unfair contention since the 
source node has less contention than intermediate nodes (by symmetry) and 
therefore can ‘overload’ the forwarding nodes with traffic, while also delaying 
them from transmitting. The exponential backoff scheme in 802.11 is also 
disadvantageous since it results in periods of time when the channel is not 
being used. The authors then consider a square lattice network with horizontal 
and vertical traffic flows. Similar yet worse results are observed such that 
source nodes experience less contention than forwarding nodes, and exponential 
backoff periods are wasteful. In a random situation with predetermined routes 
(no routing protocol present), the throughput degrades even more, mainly due to 
areas of the network lacking in forwarding nodes. 

To study the capacity of an entire large network, the authors scale a network 
such that traffic increases with number of nodes and distance. Capacity is 
found to decrease with the length of the path and is therefore dependent on the 
traffic pattern. The most scalable traffic patterns occur when source 
destination pairs are within a local vicinity of each other. This also 
demonstrates the importance of choosing a shortest path when routing.

The intuition is that ad hoc networks scale well because of spectral reuse, but 
increasing the number of nodes also increases forwarding load per node. In 
fact, ad hoc networks scale well when they behave as a set of overlapping sub-
networks. Capacity of networks is an important issue, since it limits causes 
congestion, deteriorating performance. This study shows the importance of the 
MAC layer in routing, and demonstrates that 802.11 does not significantly 
hinder capacity.
