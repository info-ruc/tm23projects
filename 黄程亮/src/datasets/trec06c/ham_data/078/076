The Capacity of Wireless Networks

Piyush Gupta, P.R.Kumar

	This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the capacity in an
ad hoc mobile network. In so doing, the network is categorized into two
types: arbitrary, where the node locations, destinations, and traffic
demands are all arbitrary, and random, where the nodes and their
destinations are randomly chosen. As in the paper by Li, et. al., the
evaluation is based on the assumption that the ad hoc network is static
rather than dynamically changing its topology. This gives rise to a
perfect scheduling algorithm that has the knowledge of all nodes and
traffic demands in such a network, thereby coordinating wireless
transmissions to avoid collisions in the medium.  

	The major contribution in this paper is that the authors have
developed the theoretical limits of capacity in wireless networks. For
arbitrary networks, the authors define an upper and lower bound on the
transport capacity; likewise, an upper and lower bound are defined on the
throughput capacity for random networks.
 
	One of the conclusions suggested in this paper is that defining
subnetworks, each of which has the information of only its surrounding
neighbors, may be a preferred approach that will prevent the throughput of
each node from degrading too much. This philosophy is consistent with the
current research attention being paid to locally active, globally reactive
routing schemes in ad hoc networks. 

	The authors have developed a number of theorms and their
respective proofs to compute the theoretical upper and lower bounds of
network capacity. This is all very good. However, there are no simulations
provided that may verify their conclusions. Also, the derivations are
based on the assumption that the wireless network is essentially static, a
model that may not be applicable to all cases in practice. Nevertheless,
this paper is one of the most comprehensive papers on ad hoc network
capacity analysis,
