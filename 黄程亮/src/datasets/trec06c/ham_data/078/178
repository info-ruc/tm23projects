Dr. Vineyard and Dr. Gilfoyle,

Hello, I am a student assistant in the office of public relations here on 
campus.  Brian Eckert is working on a press release involving both of the 
equipment grants given to our science departments from the National Science 
Foundation.  He has asked me to find out the information that he does not have 
already, so he may complete the release to send out on Monday.  Please reply 
at your first convenience and I will see that he receives the information 
promptly.

Please help shed light on the following or let me know who I should talk to:

The cluster of computers to support the electromagnetic nuclear physics 
research will be involved in what specific research?  How will they be used?

What will the conclusions of the research be applicable to in the "real 
world"?  (What would it mean to non-scientists?)

Also, is the research conducted with these computers related to the High Field 
NMR Spectrometer awarded to the chemistry department?

Thank you very much for your time!  I look forward to hearing from you and 
passing on the information to Mr. Eckert!

Sincerely,
Kelly Gyenes
Student Assistant
Public Relations Office
