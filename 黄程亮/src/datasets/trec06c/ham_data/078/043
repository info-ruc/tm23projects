26) Performance Comparison of Two On-demand Routing Protocols for Ad-
    hoc Networks

This paper presents a detailed simulation study of DSR and AODV while
varying the mobility and the number of sources over 50 node and 100
node networks. Their goal is definitely to critique and provide
research as to the usability of DSR and AODV in large networks as
usable implementations become commonplace. They utilize ns-2 in an
802.11 simulation environment, matching closely to the Broch et
al. paper. By targeting just 2 protocols, they present a more
exhaustive study of these two, comparing along 3 axes: number of
nodes, number of sources, and pause time.

Once again, we see that given a detailed study that neither protocol
outshines the other in all respects: with high numbers of sources,
AODV tends to have lower packet delays, but at higher mobility, DSR
has lower packet delays. We see that both protocols have desirable
base cases: at low mobility and link failure, we see high throughput,
low packet delays and low routing load. As we change these parameters,
the two protocols deviate highly-- we see that as the number of
sources grows, AODV's routing load highly increases, while DSR's grows
slowly, almost always having a lower routing load than AODV because of
aggressive caching.

They present observations that routing load is related to MAC
overhead and can be used as a good measure for predicting application
performance. Since AODV's routing load is mostly broadcast messages,
it tends to be comparable to DSR's load (although still about 40%
higher), which sends many unicast messages, all of which require an
RTS/CTS transmission. This MAC interaction is an interesting point
which we have not discussed thus far-- integration of the routing
protocol with knowledge of the MAC layer can give better performance
than our abstract view of the MAC we've assumed this far.

This paper presents a well thought out and detailed discussion of the
trade-offs between DSR and AODV and presents the idea that future work
should be directed towards better use of the MAC layer by routing
protocols.
