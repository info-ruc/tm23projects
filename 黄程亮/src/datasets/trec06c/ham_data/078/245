CERT Advisory CA-2001-31 Buffer Overflow in CDE Subprocess Control Service

   Original release date: November 12, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running CDE

Overview

   There  is  a  remotely  exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in a
   library  function  used  by  the  CDE Subprocess Control Service. This
   vulnerability  could  be  used  to  crash  the  service  or to execute
   arbitrary  code with root privileges. This vulnerability is documented
   in VU#172583.

I. Description

   The  Common  Desktop Environment (CDE) is an integrated graphical user
   interface  that  runs  on  UNIX  and  Linux operating systems. The CDE
   Subprocess  Control  Service (dtspcd) is a network daemon that accepts
   requests  from  clients  to  execute  commands and launch applications
   remotely.  On  systems  running CDE, dtspcd is spawned by the Internet
   services  daemon  (typically  inetd  or  xinetd)  in response to a CDE
   client request. dtspcd is typically configured to run on port 6112/tcp
   with root privileges.

   For more information about CDE, see

          http://www.opengroup.org/cde/

          http://www.opengroup.org/desktop/faq/

   There  is  a  remotely  exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in a
   shared  library  that  is  used  by dtspcd. During client negotiation,
   dtspcd  accepts  a  length  value  and subsequent data from the client
   without performing adequate input validation. As a result, a malicious
   client can manipulate data sent to dtspcd and cause a buffer overflow,
   potentially executing code with root privileges.

   The  vulnerability  was  first  reported to us in March 1999, and more
   recently   by  Internet  Security  Systems  (ISS)  X-Force.  For  more
   information, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/172583

          http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise101.php

   This  vulnerability  has been assigned the identifier CAN-2001-0803 by
   the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) group:

          http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0803

   Many  common  UNIX  systems  ship  with  CDE  installed and enabled by
   default.  To  determine  if  your  system is configured to run dtspcd,
   check for the following entries (may be wrapped):

     /etc/services

         dtspc 6112/tcp

     /etc/inetd.conf

         dtspc   stream   tcp   nowait   root   /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd
         /usr/dt/bin/dtspcd

   Any system that does not run the CDE Subprocess Control Service is not
   vulnerable to this problem.

II. Impact

   An attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Appendix  A  contains  information  from  vendors  who  have  provided
   information  for  this  advisory.  We  will  update the appendix as we
   receive more information. If a vendor's name does not appear, then the
   CERT/CC  did  not  hear  from  that vendor. Please contact your vendor
   directly.

Limit access to vulnerable service

   Until  patches are available and can be applied, you may wish to limit
   or  block  access  to  the  Subprocess  Control Service from untrusted
   networks   such   as   the   Internet.   Using  a  firewall  or  other
   packet-filtering technology, block or restrict access to the port used
   by the Subprocess Control Service. As noted above, dtspcd is typically
   configured  to  listen on port 6112/tcp. It may be possible to use TCP
   Wrapper or a similar technology to provide improved access control and
   logging  functionality  for  dtspcd  connections.  Keep  in  mind that
   blocking  ports at a network perimeter does not protect the vulnerable
   service  from the internal network. It is important to understand your
   network  configuration  and  service requirements before deciding what
   changes are appropriate. TCP Wrapper is available from

          ftp://ftp.porcupine.org/pub/security/index.html

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  When  vendors  report  new  information  to the CERT/CC, we
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
   comments.


Caldera, Inc.

   Caldera  Open  Unix  and UnixWare are vulnerable. Caldera has released
   Security Advisory CSSA-2001-SCO.30 (URL wrapped):

          ftp://stage.caldera.com/pub/security/openunix/

Compaq Computer Corporation

   Case ID SSRT0782U
   Compaq  has  not been able to reproduce the problem identified in this
   advisory  for  any Compaq OS. However, with the information available,
   we  are  including  a  code  change  for Compaq's TRU64 UNIX that will
   further reduce any potential overflow vulnerability. This updated code
   will  be  announced when patches are available from the TRU64 UNIX FTP
   site  and will be included in future releases of TRU64 UNIX. The TRU64
   UNIX FTP patch site is at:

Cray Inc.

   UNICOS, UNICOS/mk, and CrayTools are not vulnerable.


Fujitsu

   Fujitsu's UXP/V operating system is not vulnerable because it does not
   support any CDE components.


Hewlett-Packard Company

   The  version of dtspcd supplied by HP has a buffer overflow. It is not
   clear  whether  this  overflow  can  be  exploited.  To  be safe HP is
   generating  patches  to  fix  this  overflow on the assumption that it
   might be exploitable.


IBM Corporation

   IBM  addressed a buffer overflow in CDE dtspcd in AIX 4.x around April
   1999. See the following APARs for more information (URLs wrapped):

   discuss  or  confirm  vulnerabilities  until  a full investigation has
   occurred  and any necessary patch(es) or release streams are available
   for all vulnerable and supported IRIX operating systems. Until SGI has
   more  definitive  information  to provide, customers are encouraged to
   assume   all   security   vulnerabilities   as  exploitable  and  take
   appropriate  steps  according  to  local  site  security  policies and

Sun

   The  Sun  dtspcd  daemon is vulnerable to this buffer overflow. Sun is
   generating  patches  to  address  this  issue  for  all  affected  and
   supported  versions  of  Solaris. Sun will be releasing a Sun Security
   Bulletin  once  the  patches  are  officially  released  and  publicly
   available. The patches will be available from:

Xi Graphics

   We  have  not  been  able to confirm whether we are vulnerable to this
   exploit,  however  the  potential  for a buffer overrun is present. We
   will  provide  a  patch  on our FTP site for DeXtop during the week of
   [November] 12th that addresses this issue.
