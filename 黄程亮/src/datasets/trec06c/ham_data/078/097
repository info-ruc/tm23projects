Dear Lesson Study Practitioners:

The U.S.-Japan Elementary Science Project focuses on lesson study as one
strategy for spreading teaching for understanding in science and math. 
The study draws on lesson study research in both Japan and the U.S.,
with the intention of illustrating how lesson study is conducted in both
countries.  We have recently received several requests for information
about how to conduct lesson study debriefings from U.S. practitioners
who are learning lesson study.  In order to provide assistance in this
crucial part of lesson study and to help spread lesson study more
broadly, we have begun to transcribe and analyze debriefing sessions
from both Japan and the U.S. to understand more specifically how
debriefing sessions are conducted in both countries. 

Our analysis is conducted by reviewing transcripts of debriefing
sessions for structure and content.  Preliminary analysis suggests that
U.S. and Japanese debriefing sessions may differ in how teachers draw on
session moderators, and how they discuss assumptions about student
learning and the use of teaching materials and student manipulatives.

We have collected many U.S. examples of debriefing sessions, but are
seeking more to enrich our analyses.  If you would be willing to share a
video or audiotape of your lesson study debriefing – focusing on science
or mathematics – we will in return provide you with a transcript of your
discussion.  The names of discussion participants will be masked to
protect their identity.  (We may later request additional information
from you to help us understand the context for the debriefing session.)  

If you have any questions about how this material will be used or about
the study in general, please feel free to contact me at rperry@mills.edu
or visit our project website:  http://www.lessonresearch.net.

Thanks for any assistance you can provide.

Rebecca Perry
