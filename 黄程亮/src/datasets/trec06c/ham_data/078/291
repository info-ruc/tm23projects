CERT Advisory CA-2001-32 Buffer Overflow in HP-UX Line Printer Daemon

   Original release date: November 21, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

   HP9000 Servers running the following releases:

     * HP-UX Version 10.01
     * HP-UX Version 10.10
     * HP-UX Version 10.20
     * HP-UX Version 11.00
     * HP-UX Version 11.11

Overview

   The HP-UX line printer daemon (rlpdaemon) enables various clients
   to share printers over a network. A remotely exploitable buffer
   overflow vulnerability exists in the rlpdaemon.

I. Description

   By sending a specially crafted print request to an HP-UX host
   running the rlpdaemon, a local or remote attacker can trigger the
   buffer overflow. Intruders may find this vulnerability attractive
   to exploit because the line printer daemon is enabled by default to
   provide printing services. Additionally, no previous knowledge of
   or access to the vulnerable system is required for exploitation.

   Internet Security Systems (ISS) and Hewlett-Packard Company have
   issued the following announcements, respectively:

    Remote Logic Flaw Vulnerability in HP-UX Line Printer Daemon

    Hewlett-Packard Company Security Bulletin #0176

   This vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CAN-2001-0817
   by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) group:

    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0817

   For the latest and most detailed information about this
   vulnerability, please see VU#638011.

II. Impact

   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system with
   the privileges of the line printer daemon, typically superuser.

III. Solution

   Install a patch from HP. More information is available in Appendix
   A.

Restrict access to the lpd service

   As a general practice, we recommend disabling all services that are
   not explicitly required. You may wish to disable the line printer
   daemon until a patch can be applied.  If you cannot disable the
   service, you can limit your exposure to these vulnerabilities by
   using a router or firewall to restrict access to port 515/TCP
   (printer). Note that this does not protect you against attackers
   from within your network.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This appendix contains information provided by vendors for this
   advisory. When vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we
