Semantic File systems, Gifford, Jouvelot, Sheldon and O'Toole Jr.

Reviewer: Indranil Gupta

This paper describes an overlay file system where users can view
virtual directories by specifying semantic search criteria. These
criteria are specified using transducers, which support
attribute-value pairs only. Indices are maintained per file by using a
periodic (2 minute) indexing process that creates indices. As a
result, the semantic file system might be out-of-date with recent
updates.

Comments:

Only individual file field-value attributes are considered. More
general semantics for file systems (such as attributes for linked
object files) are not considered. The user has to program a transducer
all by herself (from scratch) - no templates or abstraction is
provided for this.

Updates are reflected lazily on to the semantic file system. This is
effectively a (fixed) tradeoff between the cost of actual actions on the file
system and the level consistency. This issue needs to be explored more
in the scenario of a set of objects over an ad-hoc network. In other
words, the tradeoff should be static depending on access patterns,
mobility etc.
