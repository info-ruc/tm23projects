Been there, done that, bought the t-shirt.

The attached patch courtesy of Jens Axboe
fixed my Compaq 6500 which was giving me
fits - basically in 2.4.14 it had a nasty habit of
scribbling on the disk and then locking up,
requiring a power cycle, manual fsck and
file restoration to get it running again.

With this patch 2.4.14 has been solid.
