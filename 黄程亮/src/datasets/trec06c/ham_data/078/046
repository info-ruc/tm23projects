on-demand routing comparison:

This paper discusses the relative performance of two on-demand ad hoc
network routing protocols (DSR and AODV).  While this paper is
primarily a simulation study, it also makes recommendations for
improving the performance of the two protocols.

Their simulation model appears to be based on the simulation work
developed in the previous paper (paper #25), and so uses a robust
version of ns-2 to simulate the wireless ad hoc network protocols.

In general, they conclude that DSR is better than AODV in less
stressful networks, while it is vice versa in stressful networks.
DSR, however, normally will generate less routing load than AODV.
They also notice that the DSR caching policy will affect protocol
performance.

They suggest both protocols can be improved by using
congestion-related metrics to evaluate routes, rather than shortest
path, which is intuitively obvious--but know one is doing to yet.
They also suggest removed aged packets from the network to help
congestion.  Finally they suggest the behavior between the routing and
MAC layers may affect performance.
