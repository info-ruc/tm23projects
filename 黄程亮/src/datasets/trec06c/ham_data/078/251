Tiny OS:

Tiny OS is a very small event-driven operating system for use in embedded
sensor networks.  It is not really all that interesting.  A fairly trivial
application of standard embedded system O/S design.  I am really unsure of
any useful insight from this, other than that it is a viable building
block.

Smart Dust:

This on the other hand, is a fairly novel idea and I am impressed at their
ambitious goals in tackling the hardware integration problem inherent in
very time sensor devices.  Similar integration problems are being
investigated in Cornell's ECE695 course this semester.  They have a ways
to go, however, to acheive the size that they are seeking.
