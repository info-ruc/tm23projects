25) A Performance Comparison of Multi-hop Wireless Ad hoc Network Routing
Protocols

This paper presents a performance comparison, using simulations, of four
ad hoc routing protocols: AODV, DSR, TORA and DSDV. The ns-2 network
simulator has been used for the comparison, which the authors have
extended to model the MAC and physical-layer behavior of IEEE 802.11
wireless LAN.

The network consists of 50 mobile nodes spread over a rectangular area of
1500m x 300m. The nodes have a nominal transmission range of 250m. Nodes
move in the model using the random way-point model characterized by pause
time whenever a node reaches its destination location. The traffic loads
are kept low (4 packets/s, 10-30 sources, 64 byte packets). Packet
delivery fraction, number of routing packets and distribution of path
lengths were used as performance metrics.

The four protocols studied - DSDV, TORA, DSR and AODV - show good
performances in some cases yet have certain drawbacks in certain other
cases. DSDV, which is a proactive protocol, has a very high packet
delivery ratio in low mobility rate and small node velocities but it fails
to converge as the node mobility increases. TORA seems to perform the
worst of all the four protocols in the scenarios examined, due to
congestion of the network caused by excessive routing traffic generated.
Still, it manages to deliver over 90% of the packets in cases with 10-20
sources. The performance of DSR was found to be pretty impressive in all
the cases examined. But the use of source routes tends to increase the
amount of traffic (in bits) in the network. AODV was also found to perform
well at all the rates of mobility and movement speeds, but was found to
generate more routing overhead packets especially in cases of high
mobility.

This paper is one of the preliminary study of comparison of routing
protocols for ad hoc networks and provides a lot of insights into their
operation. However, I feel it has not been completely fair to DSDV (which
is a proactive protocol and has the ability to provide routes
instantaneously) and TORA (which provides multiple routes to the
destination and has the ability to repair them on the fly). Apart from
this, the small number of nodes (50) and the restricted network area
(1500m x 300m) probably do not expose some of the other characteristics of
these protocols. A study of the comparative scalability of these protocols
would have been quite interesting.
