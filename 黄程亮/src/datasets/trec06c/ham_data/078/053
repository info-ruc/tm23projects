I have had great replies to my request!  Thanks.  I think I can find
something now.  
FYI, the important info seems to be:
 
You can order a tape called "Can You Lift 100 Kg?" from Catherine Lewis' web
site,  <http://lessonresearch.net/> http://lessonresearch.net, which
contains segments of lesson planning and debriefing.

 

OR

The project you refered to is the U.S. Japanese Workshop sponsored by MSEB
and the US National Commission on Mathematics Instruction. The proceedings
titled Classroom Practice as a Medium for Professional Development which has
a video component that includes a classroom demonstration lesson and the
debriefing session held afterwards will be available from the National
Academy Press shortly after the first of the year. You can get the details
from the National Academy of Sciences website.
