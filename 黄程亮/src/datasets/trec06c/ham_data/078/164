Semantic File System

This paper introduces the idea of characterising each file in the file
system with a small set of attributes (author, extension, keywords...) 
The usual tree directory structure would be a specific case of the
previous, with the name of the directory being an attribute.

In other word consider the file system to be a database on which all the
files are automaticaly inserted with their attributes. These attributes
allow much easier search and retrival. Note: filters need to be writen
for each knid of file, if not the system won't be able to add to
automaticaly index it.

Their implementation is transparent to the file system: each attribute
is shown as a virtual directory under the FS. So ls, completion and so
on work.


This is a really nice idea. I didn't see any development for Unix
though (their implementation was BSD). Maybe people don't really need
the power of this tool to look for files?
