This paper provides many theoretical results on the capacity of wireless 
networks, supported by simulation. Specifically, it considers random and 
arbitrary networks, and determines the maximum throughput capacity using the 
protocol model and the physical model. These results help us see the 
constraints of wireless networks, particularly in terms of scalability.

Random networks distribute nodes with a uniform distribution and have random 
traffic patterns, while arbitrary networks choose node distribution, and 
traffic arbitrarily in the workspace. The theoretical upper bound on capacity 
assumes perfect scheduling without collision and no node mobility. Obviously, 
this upper bound is far from reality and will degrade severely once nodes 
contend for the channel. The upper bound is independent of whether a single 
channel is used, or divided into sub channels. This is an important result due 
to the difficulties of employing FDMA and CDMA in wireless networks.

Capacity of the system was found to improve if the power decays faster as a 
function of distance. This is because fast decaying signals allow more 
frequency reuse throughout the network. Throughput decreases with n, and 
therefore increasing the size of networks greatly degrades performance. Scaling 
also increases power consumption per node, since each node will have to 
participate in more packet forwarding. The authors suggest that ad hoc networks 
can accommodate larger scale networks as long as source destination pairs 
remain local. Using Voronoi tessellation of cells, and straight lines to model 
paths, an upper bound is found on the traffic load passing through each cell or 
cluster of nodes. Also, they suggest that forming clusters or cells with an 
active cluster head will be profitable and possibly reduce power consumption.

I think the most important result is that wireless networks cannot be scaled 
easily, and effort should be made to keep them small. In general, it reinforces 
the intuition that wireless networks have very limited resources that only 
become worse with channel contention and mobility, which occur frequently in ad 
hoc networks.
