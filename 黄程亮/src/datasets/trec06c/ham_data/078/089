45) The Capacity of Wireless Networks

This SEMINAL work by Gupta and Kumar presents theoretical bounds for the
capacity of wireless networks. The network is assumed to be stationary
where nodes are randomly located on a disc/sphere and the paper allows
for ideal scheduling algorithm which knows the locations of all the nodes
and all the traffic demands. The paper shows a rather pessimistic result
that as the number of nodes (which are communicating with each other) in
the wireless network become large, the throughput of the network
diminishes to zero. The throughput constriction comes from the pervasive
need for all the nodes to share the channel locally with other nodes
while forwarding packets originating at the node or at other nodes.

The paper shows that even with full knowledge of the network and perfect
scheduling of the nodes, temporally and spatially, the throughput of the
multi-hop wireless network decreases with increase in the number of nodes
in the network. However, the authors have considered stationary networks.
In a very interesting work by David Tse, it has been shown that mobility
actually increases the throughput if one can allow for long delays in the
actual delivery of the packets (Ah! a glimmer of hope.. but probably not
very practical). Their argument is that due to random mobility,
eventually the source (or one of the small number of nodes to which the
node forwarded the packet) would move close enough to the destination so
that the packet can actually be delivered directly (or in a very small
number of hops).

The authors discuss some possible implications of their work. They state
that the performance of large networks may be unacceptable and so network
designers should perhaps focus of designing small networks or networks
where hosts limit their communication to their neighborhood. They show
that if all the nodes transmit data to only their neighbors, the data
rate can be maintained constant irrespective of the actual size of the
network. The show that in a network with n nodes, the fraction of time
that a node's modem is busy decreases with n in a inverse log fashion.
Another implication of their work is the feasibility of clustering in
multi-hop wireless networks. Division of a channel into subchannels
(frequency division, time division or code division) does not have any
effect on their results. They show that adding purely relaying nodes into
the network may increase the capacity, but a large number of such nodes
may be required for a noticeable change in capacity. It has also been
pointed out that the transport capacity improves if the rf power fall-off
exponent is large.

The authors point out a few areas of further research. They are including
mobility, link failures and multiple access into the analysis. Delay in
delivering the data packets to the destination also needs to be taken
into account. Spatial directivity or beamforming may improve the
performance. Also, having an information theoretic picture of this
problem would be immensely interesting.
