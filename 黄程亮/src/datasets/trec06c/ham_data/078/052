Hello again.  We have one high school group going.  Last year three were part
of K-12 group and this year they've added two teachers and are functioning as a
high school group.

The teachers teach all grades and all classes.  One AP, one CMP, two ninth, one
is actually from another high school in the district. The dept. chair is one of
those involved and the principal is supportive which also helps.

Let me know what specific information you need.
