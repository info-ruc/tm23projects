26) Performance Comparison of two On-Demand Routing Portocols for Ad hoc
Networks.

This paper compares the performance of two popular on-demand ad hoc
routing protocols: DSR and AODV. Even though the two protocols reactively
find a route to the destination, they differ in many aspects which makes
them perform quite differently in different scenarios. Important
differences between the protocols are:
1. DSR is based on source routing and has access to a lot more routing
information at each node as compared to AODV which is based on distance
vectors.
2. The destination replies to many copies of the same query reaching it
along different paths in DSR. In AODV, the destination replies to only the
first copy of the query reaching it. Thus, a single route request cycle in
DSR generates a lot of information which is cached in all the nodes
receiving (or overhearing) the reply packet.
3. DSR does not expire stale routes or prefer fresher routes. Thus the
aggressive caching of DSR has the drawback of polluting the caches of
other nodes too and may severely affect the performance of TCP.
4. The route error messages have the effect of deleting all the routes
containing the failed link in AODV. In DSR, the route error message
travels back only along the failed route at hand.

The simulation model used consists of 802.11 MAC, radio range of 250m,
nominal bit rate of 2 Mbps, a send buffer of 64 packets and 50 (100) nodes
in an area of 1500m x 300m (2200m x 600m). The velocity of the nodes is
uniformly distributed between 0-20m/s and a random waypoint model is used.
The metrics evaluated are: packet delivery fraction, end-to-end delay,
routing load and MAC load.

In terms of metrics like delay and trroughput, the simulation results show
that DSR usually performs better on a lower scale and when the network
conditions are not stressful. AODV tends to out-perform DSR in more
stressful conditions. DSR almost always has a lower routing load than
AODV. But when one looks at the total MAC load, DSR was found to generate
higher overall network load than AODV in the high mobility or high traffic
scenarios. The increase in the MAC load for DSR is attributed to the fact
that DSR retuns many routes to the source which are unicasted back. In low
mobility cases, DSR works great but its performance degrades below AODV in
high mobility cases mainly due to its aggressive use of route caches where
the routes are not timed-out.

It would have been interesting to see how these two protocols scale to
bigger networks with a few hundred nodes. Also the choice of the elongated
rectangluar network area again may not necessarily show the whole picture
related to these two protocols. The authors mention a few ideas which may
possibly improve the performace of these two protocols. The main among
them are: expiring stale routes in DSR, using congestion related metrics,
removing aged packets from the netwrok and studying in greater detail the
effects of interactions between protocol layers.
