Performance Comparison of Two On-Demand Routing Protocols for Ad Hoc
Networks

Charles Perkins, Elizabeth M. Royer, Samir R. Das

This paper is intended to evaluate the effectiveness of AODV and DSR, two
of the most popular routing algorithms in ad hoc networks. The performance
metrics include the packet delivery fraction, average end-to-end delay of
data packets, normalized routing load, and normalized MAC load. Although
both routing algorithms are based on reactive routing, their designs are
sufficiently different, and a simple "better" or "worse" can in no way
provide a authoritative judgement of how these two algorithms compare in
performance. Indeed, the authors of this paper, and the end of their
evaluation, propose several scenarios in which one may be favored than the
other, meritting both algorithms to a variety of ad hoc applications in
which they may be more effective.

A few observations emerge from the evaluations performed in this paper:

1)AODV has a better packet delivery fraction than DSR when the nodes
operate in high mobility, whereas the situation is reversed when the
mobility is not so great. 
2)In a sparsely populated network (i.e., 50 nodes), AODV outperforms DSR
in average delay when the nodes operate in high mobility; DSR does better
than AODV in this regard when nodes slow down in the network. In a densely
populated network (i.e., 100 nodes), AODV consistently incurs less delay
than DSR in a much larger range of nodal mobility. This may be due to the
fact that the benefit of DSR's route caching is up to a certain extent,
beyond which the high load in the network deems this mechanism to o large
to improve the performance.
3)DSR has lower routing overhead than AODV. This is due to the fact that
AODV employs many route requests, packet-wise, in querying a route, who
outnumber the amount of route replies in DSR, a major contributing source
of overhead in the latter.
4)When the MAC layer overhead is factored into calculating the total
overhead, DSR is found to have higher overall network load than AODV in
all scenarios. 

One of the contributions in this paper is that it examines the overhead in
both the network and MAC layers, thus providing a more accurate
perspective of the overhead that results from employing the two
algorithms. It highlights the importance of coordinating the work of the
routing algorithm with the efficiency of MAC layer in order to minimize
the overall network overhead. Another contribution is that it summarizes
the strengths and weaknesses of the two algorithms and presents some
likely real-life scenarios where each of them may be better suited for
deployment.
