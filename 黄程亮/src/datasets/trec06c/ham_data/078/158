The design and implementation of an intentional naming system

This paper presents an interestng concept: decoupling the IP address
from the resource name.  Clients of a resource need not keep track of
changes in IP address or network route to the resource server.  A
request for a resource is specified as a name or descriptive attribute.
The request is routed to the resolver which further routes packets to
the resource matching the request attribute.  The address of the
resource is either sent back to the client in the case of early binding
or the request is further sent to one or many resources depending on the
late binding mechanism specified: anycast or multicast.  The resolvers
maintain an overlay network that keep a consistent view of the available
resources.

The idea of decoupling server IP addresses from the resource name is a
very interesting concept.  This scheme would be specially beneficial in
mobile applications where the servers offering the same resource might
change over time based on the location.   The intentional naming scheme
borrows the idea of the SFS and is an effective  model for resource
requests.  

However, the main drawback of INS is the proactive maintenance of the
overlay network.  If used in an ad hoc setting, this scheme would be
increasingly expensive, at least as expensive as maintaining a multicast
tree.  Maintaining such overlay networks for different virtual spaces
would definitely affect the scalability of INS.  In my opinion, an
interesting modification to INS could be a reactive approach, with
caching, to search for resources, such that frequently used resources
are stored in cache and the updates for lesser used ones do not congest
the network.
