46) Capacity of Ad hoc Wireless Networks

This paper illustrates the capacity of wireless ad hoc networks over the
802.11 MAC layer using simulations and analysis. The article examines the
limitations imposed by the use of a single shared channel over data
forwarding and shows its effects on the network capacity and scalability.
Various factors affecting the capacity, like network size, traffic
patterns and local interactions, are studied alone and in combination.

The authors examine different topologies: chains, sets of horizontal
chains, grid and random topology. The authors conclude that the 802.11 is
successful in determining reasonably good schedules. At the same time,
they find that the simulated capacity is quite small in comparison to the
optimal value. For example, for a chain topology, the ideal capacity is
1/4 and the simulated one is about 1/7.

The paper shows that scalability of ad hoc networks is dependent on the
locality of the communication pattern. Large networks are feasible only
if the traffic is limited to the neighborhood of a node. The results in
this paper reinforce the results in the Gupta and Kumar paper.

It would be interesting to see how the results of the paper change when
mobility is introduced.
