Perf Comparison of MultiHop Wireless Routing Protocol

This paper presents a performance comparison of TORA, DSR, DSDV abd
AODV. DSDV is implemented in 2 ways (sepending on when the triggered
updates are done).
The results are that TORA is not very effecient (huge control overhead),
DSDV-SQ and TORA also have a low sucess delivery. 
AODV and DSR both perform pretty well, DSR having a lower routing
overhead.

The differences are always larger at high mobility rates.

Note that ARP packets were not taken into account in the simulations.
TORA has is own "ARP process" embeddeed in the protocol (the beaconning
messages). I think this can make a difference at a large rate of setting 
up new routes, but not enough to change the result of the simulations.

There is the right are the wrong way of doing DSR. (right= only the 
receipt of a new metric should cause a triggered update).

The simultation didn't address the performances of TCP over those
protocols. My guess is that there are relatively closely related to the
performances of the protocols.
