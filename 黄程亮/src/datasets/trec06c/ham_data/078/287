CERT Summary CS-2001-04

   November 20, 2001

   Each  quarter, the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) issues the CERT
   Summary  to  draw  attention  to  the types of attacks reported to our
   incident  response  team,  as  well  as  other noteworthy incident and
   vulnerability information. The summary includes pointers to sources of
   information for dealing with the problems.

   Past CERT summaries are available from:

   Recent Activity

   Since the last regularly scheduled CERT summary, issued in August 2001
   (CS-2001-03),  we  have  seen  a new worm known as "Nimda," as well as
   active  exploitation  of  a  vulnerability in Microsft DNS servers. In
   addition,  we  have  published  a  paper  on denial of service trends,
   issued a new PGP key, and updated the UNIX Security Checklist.

   For  more  current  information  on  activity  being  reported  to the
   CERT/CC,  please  visit the CERT/CC Current Activity page. The Current
   Activity  page  is  a  regularly updated summary of the most frequent,
   high-impact  types  of  security  incidents  and vulnerabilities being
   reported  to the CERT/CC. The information on the Current Activity page
   is reviewed and updated as reporting trends change.

          CERT/CC Current Activity
          http://www.cert.org/current/current_activity.html


    1. W32/Nimda Worm

       Over  the  past  several  months,  we  have  received  reports  of
       malicious  code  known  as  the  "W32/Nimda  Worm."  This worm can
       propogate  itself  via  several  methods, including email, network
       shares,  or by visiting an infected web site. On September 18, the
       CERT/CC issued an advisory on Nimda.

                CERT Advisory CA-2001-26: Nimda Worm
                http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2001-26.html


    2. Exploitation of Vulnerability in 
       SSH1 CRC-32 Compensation Attack Detector

       The  CERT/CC  has  received  multiple  reports  of  systems  being
       compromised   via   the   CRC-32   compensation   attack  detector
       vulnerability  (VU#945216). On November 5, the CERT/CC released an
       incident   note   which   describes   system   compromises  via  a
       vulnerability in the SSH1 (Secure Shell Protocol v1) CRC-32 attack
       detection  code. Consequentially, we are also receiving reports of
       increased scanning activity for the SSH service (22/tcp).

                Incident  Note  IN 2001-12: Exploitation of vulnerability
                in SSH1 CRC-32 compensation attack detector
                http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2001-12.html

                Vulnerability  Note  #945216:  SSH CRC32 attack detection
                code contains remote integer overflow
                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/945216


    3. DNS Cache Poisoning in Microsoft DNS Servers

       The  CERT/CC  has  received  reports from sites experiencing cache
       corruption  on  systems running Microsoft DNS Server. We issued an
       incident  note  which  describes this corruption and its impact on
       systems.  The  default  configuration of this software allows data
       from  malicious or incorrectly configured DNS servers to be cached
       by a Microsoft DNS server. This corruption can result in erroneous
       DNS information being returned to clients which use this server.

                DNS Servers
                http://www.cert.org/incident_notes/IN-2001-11.html

                Vulnerability Note #109475: Microsoft Windows NT and 2000
                Domain  Name  Servers  allow  non-authoritative RRs to be
                cached by default
                http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/109475


    4. Trends In Denial Of Service Attack Technology

       This  paper  describes  the  current and possible future states of
       denial  of  service  (DoS)  technology.  This document is in Adobe
       Acrobat format, and requires Acrobat Reader.

   Response Team (AusCERT) have jointly published version 2.0 of the UNIX
