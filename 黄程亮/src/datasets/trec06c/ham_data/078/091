The paper investigates the maximum achievable transmission rate by a node
in a multihop wireless topology. The communication model is random
pairwise multihop transmission, under two absrtact models ('protoco,
physical'), that determine the criteria for correct reception. The network
models considered are 'arbitrary' and 'random', the difference being not
so much the selection of the destination but more the homogeneity of node
parameters (xmission radius, rate etc). 

The paper shows that the achievable upper bound, under the assumption of
an optimal placement of nodes, choice of transmission radius, and for a
*single* shared channel, cannot be improved even if multiple channels were
used. (Even if an optimal scheduling of transmissions was feasible; of
course, note that the aggregate throughput of the set of channels *cannot*
exceed that of the initial channel.)

A key point is the set up of the model itself: the n randomly chosen nodes
chose a random destination (i.e., possibly high average path length) and
transmit at a *constant* rate W. Neither assumption is necessarily valid
for a wide range of MANET instances. To that extent, the 'shadow' on the
ad hoc networking paradigm might not be that heavy (:-). Scalabilty is
undeniably harmed as achievable node-throughput is forced to a lower
value, inversely proportional to the sqrt() of the network size, but under
the above assumptions. The direction that the authors made, i.e., the
design of smaller networks, is in essence the realisation of the simple
fact that MANET traffic is localized, or MANET subdomains are (may be)
stub AS's. If this is compared with the outline of the [Li, Morris] paper
result, things start to look better.  (Note: the Grossglausser] paper is
inticing, but its communication model does not appear more realistic, to
say the least)
