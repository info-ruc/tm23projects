CERT Advisory CA-2001-29 Oracle9iAS Web Cache vulnerable to buffer overflow

   Original release date: October 25, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

   Systems running:

     * Oracle9iAS Web Cache

Overview

   A remotely exploitable buffer overflow in the Oracle9iAS Web Cache
   allows intruders to execute arbitrary code or disrupt the normal
   operation of Web Cache.

I. Description

   Defcom Labs has discovered a remotely exploitable buffer overflow
   vulnerability in the Oracle9iAS Web Cache (on all platforms) that
   allows intruders to either execute arbitrary code with the
   privileges of the Web Cache process, or disrupt the normal
   operation of Web Cache.  The Oracle9iAS Web Cache provides four web
   services that are all vulnerable and enabled by default when the
   software is installed.  For more information about these web
   services, please see the Oracle9iAS Web Cache Administration and
   Deployment Guide (registration required).  These services and the
   associated ports they listen on are listed below:

     * 1100/tcp (incoming web cache proxy)
     * 4000/tcp (administrative interface)
     * 4001/tcp (web XML invalidation port)
     * 4002/tcp (statistics port)

   Additional information regarding this vulnerability is available at

     http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/webcache.pdf
     http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/3BCEE434.F597D815@defcom.com

II. Impact

   An intruder can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
   web cache process or disrupt the normal operation of Web Cache.
   Additionally, an intruder might be able to intercept and/or modify
   sensitive data such as credentials and other types of sensitive
   information passing through the host running Web Cache. Finally, an
   intruder may be able to gain access to other systems by using Web
   Cache as an entry point into the network or by leveraging an
   existing trust relationship between Web Cache and another system.

III. Solution

   Install a patch from Oracle. More information is available in
   Appendix A.
