This paper presented a the Intentional Naming System (INS) which supports
a resource discovery and service location systems for mobile network.
The design goals INS are expressiveness, responsiveness, robustness and
easy configuration.

The main idea of INS is to separate service names and locations. Applications
describe services what they are looking for, not locations where to find
them. Then name resolvers find the appropriate locations by maintaining a
mapping between service descriptions and their locations. This is a good
approach for the mobile networks where applications do not know the exact
locations of the services. 

INS uses an intentional name languages based on a hierarchy of attributes
and values, called name specifiers. Name specifiers are composed of attribute
and values. They form an av pair and have a hierarchical tree-like structure.

Intentional Name Resolvers (INR) form an overlay network among themselves,
over which they send intentional naming information. Services periodically
advertise their intentional names and INRs maintain those information. When
client make name resolution requests INRs resolve the requests. INS supports
three types of resolution: early binding, intentional anycast and intentional
multicast.

In my opinion, the main contribute of this paper is that it provides a naming
systems which can support mobile ad hoc systems efficiently. As they said in
the paper, the separation of service names and locations can deal with dynamic
environment flexibly.
