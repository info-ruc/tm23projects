The design and implementation of an intentional naming system, Adjie-Winoto, Schwartz, Balakrishnan, Lilley.

Reviewer: Indranil Gupta

This paper presents an architecture for object naming and location on
a dynamic network (a mildly static network is considered for
experiments). Objects are named using a series of attribute-value
pairs, nested where there are dependencies. The entire attribute-value
search space is effectively a (very large) tree with (potentially
unbounded) degree. Updates to the tree (new attributes or values, new
objects, etc.) are propagated periodically from their source, and
entries at other nodes (the INResolvers) time out. Any client wishing
to access an object contacts an INR on the INR overlay network, which
either replies back directly or passes on the query. Intentional
resource discovery and multicast are both supported.

Comments:

The main contribution of the paper is a proof-of-concept
implementation. Interesting research issues such as a search over a
search tree replicated only partially at every INR are not looked
into. This model would yield great benefits when nodes are short-live
or have small memories, and the size of the entire global search tree
is too large to maintain at any single node.
