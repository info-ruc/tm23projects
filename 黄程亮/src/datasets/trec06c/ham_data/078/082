This paper designed/analyzed a mathematical model of the capacity
of wireless networks and gave a theoretical limit of the throughout.

For the analysis, wireless networks are divided into two types. In
Arbitrary Networks, nodes' locations, destinations and traffic pattern
are arbitrary. In random networks, those are random, i.e. independently
and uniformly distributed. For these two networks, mathematical models
are designed and the upper bound and lower bound of capacity are analyzed.

Because this paper is purely mathematical and I couldn't understand it,
I may not be at a good position to review this paper. But I'd like give
the following comments.

1. The main contribution of this paper is that it give theoretical limit
   of the capacity of wireless network. I think it is very important
   because this study can give a insight which simulation study cannot
   provide.

2. This paper showed that splitting the channel does not change the
   capacity limit. This was quite different from my thought that splitting
   the channel will reduce the collision and increase the capacity.

3. As far as I understand, the network model of this paper is static.
   Actually, the other paper I reviewed also assumed the static model.
   It might be because modeling/analyzing dynamic models are too difficult.
   Though Static model gives very useful knowledge, I'm not sure how well
   it will match with practical ad hoc networks.
