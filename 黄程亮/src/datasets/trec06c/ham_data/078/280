Freenet - A peer-to-peer network daemon with anonymity

Debian abstract:
Freenet is a peer-to-peer network designed to allow the distribution of
information over the Internet in an efficient manner, without fear of
censorship. Freenet is completely decentralized, meaning that there is no
person, computer, or organisation in control of Freenet or essential to
its operation. This means that Freenet cannot be attacked like centralized
peer-to-peer systems such as Napster. Freenet also employs intelligent
routing and caching meaning that it learns to route requests more
efficiently, automatically mirrors popular data, makes network flooding
almost impossible, and moves data to where it is in greatest demand. All
of this makes it much more efficient and scalable than systems such as   
Gnutella. For more info see http://www.freenetproject.org/

It is the first time I see a paper written by people from so many
different (and so far away) places. Freenet made it to Debian's woddy
and I presume to other Linux distribution, which means it is a sucess. I
didn't test it though.

I think it is a very good system. Privacy is so weak now, this is
defending it. I think Freenet has the potential to be spread out on a
large scale. It consumes more bandwith and more storage place than
conventional storage systems, but storage is not an issue anymore, and
bandwith not often, and should not be one for long.

This raises of course the issue of software piracy and underage
porngraphy, because it makes it much more difficult to track down.

The fact that there is a TTL value make the system weaker in some sense:
given a set of presumable stored files by a node, requesting them with a 
TTL of 1 allows with a high probability to say if this nodes stores a
susbsantial subset of this files. But do we care? 
My question is: can such an attack be made with a TTL of say 4?

One could envisage to change the TTL counter to a time based value, and
either assume that processing time is random, or add a random delay of
the order of magnitude of the processing delay.
