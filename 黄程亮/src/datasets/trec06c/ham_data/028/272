>
>I'm replacing my aging home PC with an iMac (look at my email address: I
can get one dirt cheap!) and I'm wondering if I can use it to pilot my
trusty HandyBoard. Anybody have any experience in this area? I'd like to
throw away the PC...

>The iMac has no serial port, only USB connectivity but there is third party
USB to Serial connectors available
(http://www.keyspan.com/products/USB/adapter,
http://www.momentuminc.net/products/uConnect.html or
http://www.griffintechnology.com/imac/iport.html). I just like to know if
anybody ever tried one of those thing. Or if there is any plan to upgrade
the handyBoad to USB ;^)
