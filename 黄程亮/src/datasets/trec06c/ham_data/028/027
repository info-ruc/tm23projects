Subject: IC errors in arithmetic operation

Thankyou for your kind response to my student Javaid Iqbal on errors in
using floating point divide within IC software.  The errors have
effectively brought our use to a full stop at present because we cannot
rely on results nor bypass what has become a random occurance of the
error.  Would you know of anybody who can fix the bug or a different
software environment to use?   

Kind regards
