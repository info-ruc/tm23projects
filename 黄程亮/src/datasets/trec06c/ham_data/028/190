We're using a track drive system and we're going to be using L.E.D.
proximity sensors off of the teeth of the track gears.  The tank tracks
appear to be very stable but it's still too early in the development to
know how repeatable the robot movements are going to be.

Although the knowledge of how far the robot has moved is of some
importance, the algorithms I've been reading about only need an
approximation for mapping the surrounding environment.
