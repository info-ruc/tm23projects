Subject: Optrex lcd displays
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

	I am trying to interface an Optrex DMC display to a miniboard. What pins
besides the data lines need to be connected and to what?
Anyone used these displays yet, I have two a one line x 16 characters and a
two line x 16 characters. The pin out lists;

Vcc
Vss
Vee

I understand Vcc but what are the other two, and what is the E pin........
Any help would be appreciated
