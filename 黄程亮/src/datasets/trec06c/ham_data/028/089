Hi Rajbala,

in germany i can get this sensor from "Conrad Electronic". The Sensor is
produced from Sharp.

It is a very interesting sensor, because it is cheap (ca. 16,00$)
It is possible to measure distances between 8-80cm, with a accuracy from =
round
about 1cm up to 10cm (Distance above 60cm). You get
the distance coded into a 8Bit word.

My software interface (Assembler) worked not properly, i think i have tim=
ing
problems with the device.




The GP2D02 is a "Position sensitive detector =3D PSD" it works like
triangluation and measure with short ir pulses.

For more information see:  http://www.xs4all.nl/~jwasys/gp2d02.html

good luck and i hope somebody can help
