Hi Sargent,
I have successfully downloaded the new version of pcode. I received the
bootstrap message "IC v3.2 beta 1". I have done the arithmatic operations
and got accurate answers.
I would like to thank all those you helped me in solving this problem by
taking personal interest. 
I would like to thank Mr Randy Sargent, Fred Martin and jon Howell for
their special help.

Regards
