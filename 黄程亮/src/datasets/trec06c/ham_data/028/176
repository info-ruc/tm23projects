I've had good results using the Hall-effect magnetic sensors that
Patrick Hui sent with my HandyBoard.  I glued magnets into three of the
six holes in a Lego pulley wheel and glued the sensor into a small Lego
brick.  I don't know the part number, but I'm sure that the usual
sources (Digikey, Mouser, etc.) probably have similar items.  Good luck.
