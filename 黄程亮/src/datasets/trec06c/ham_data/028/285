hi eric,

i haven't tried any of these products, but they *should* work.  the
mac hb software uses low level driver calls, so if that stuff is
patched and translated to usb, it would work.

but if i were you i'd get one and try it on an existing machine before
buying one.  please let us know the result.  thanks.

fred

se thing. Or if there is any plan to upgrade the handyBoad to USB ;^)
