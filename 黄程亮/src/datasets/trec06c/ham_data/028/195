The two basic approaches are (1) a bitmap, and (2) a list of obstacle
coordinates.

A bitmap is just a grid of 1's and 0's indicating the presence of an
obstacle at each grid point.  It can be implemented as a 1-D integer
array with a simple indexing function to specify the proper array index
and bit.  If you have 32 kilobytes available, you can map a grid up to
about 500 x 500 points.

A list of obstacle coordinates is more useful where the search area is
very large and/or where the obstacles are fairly sparse and memory is at
a premium.  One way to store and retrieve the obstacle coordinates is in
a hash table.  You could cram both the x and y coordinates into a single
integer.  The list is a little harder to use algorithmically than a
bitmap.

I haven't actually tried these yet, so if you beat me to it, let me know
how it works out.  Good luck!
