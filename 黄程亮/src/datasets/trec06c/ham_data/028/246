To convert from 0-3 to 0-5 I would suspect that all you need is a 2N2222
NPN transistor with a couple of resistors to bias it.  For example:

                                     +5volts
                                   100 ohm resistor
                                     collector ----------0-5 input
  0-3v output -----1k resistor ----- base
                                     emitter
                                     0volts

Depending upon the 0-3v frequency, the resistances can be increased to
minimized the power used from the batteries.  Also the transistor is
just off of the top of my head as a general purpose NPN and if higher
switching speeds become necessary I'm sure there are more appropriate
choices for transistors.
