Subject: Intermittend IC floating point divide problem


Dear Richard and Javaid,

I have assigned a programmer to track down the floating point divide
problem, and will keep you posted on its resolution.  We believe it is a
problem with the floating point library that is assembled into the pcode,
so it is likely we should be able to release a new version of the pcode
with a fix to the problem.
