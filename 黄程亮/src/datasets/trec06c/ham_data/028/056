Somebody already did part of the job. If you go to http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/robots/skguide.html you can download a pcode source for a road warrior kind of robot with some "corrections to the floating point math library to produce correct results for several previously buggy operations".

I haven't looked at it yet but it might be interesting to you or your programmer assigned to the task. Poor guy! I'll recommend a good read of the The Art Of Computer Programming; Fundamental Algorithms by Donald E. Knuth (Do not forget to get the errata from his Web site: there is a bug in his division algorithm).
