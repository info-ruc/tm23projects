	Any chance that the source for the recent pcode FP divide
bugfix can be released so that it could be retrofitted to the 2.81
freeware source?  I'm not suggesting that Newton Labs actually do
the retrofit, just that the source for the patch be released.
Weren't the original FP routines freeware from Motorola?  Of course,
there is always the disassembly option ;-)
