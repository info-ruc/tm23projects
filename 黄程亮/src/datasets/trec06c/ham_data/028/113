Subject: Controlling Parallel Port Pins

This is kinda off the HB topic, sorry.

How do you control the individual output states of the parallel port pins?

I'm working with some students where they must use a parallel port to 
control the states transistors and chips that ultimately control a robot.

Is there some simple C function or VB, etc. that will let you set the output 
states of the individual pins?  They need to control 8 pins.

Thanks for any leads.  :)
