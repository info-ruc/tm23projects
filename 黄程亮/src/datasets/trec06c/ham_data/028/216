Try Lego Technic kits.  Start with a basic kit like the Giant Model Set
(#8277) for $44, and add a couple 9V mini gear motors (#5225) for $17.50
each and a gear assortment for $4.50.  Call Lego Shop-At-Home for a
catalog (1-800-453-4652).

If that's more than you're willing to spend, the Mondotronics Robot
Store (1-800-374-5764) has a Bulldozer kit for $40 that includes a
twin-motor gearbox.
