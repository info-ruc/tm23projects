Hi

I did the port of the smoothpwm stuff into the IC 3.x source code. The
Newton Labs ftp site has the smoothpwm files available from:
ftp://newtonlabs.com/contrib/smooth-pwm/

If someone can get me the code for the FP fix, I'll see if I can get a new
pcode built - RL has been pretty heavy lately, so I've missed most of the
recent HandyBoard traffic....    :(

Thanks
Scott
