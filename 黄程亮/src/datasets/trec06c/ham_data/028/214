Subject: Good 9V motor source
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi all....I'm looking for a good source of 9V gear motors that i could
use with the handyboard for a mobile robot.  Currently, i am just using
the little 9v motors that came with the board, which i have plugged into
the cheap gearbox from a toy tank, and it is starting to fall apart. 
ive found that building the drive system is the most frustrating part of
all my projects, and i was wondering what others have used and where
they've gotten parts.  i was considering modifying servos, but large
enough ones tend to be upwards of $60 each, and i need 2.
	Any advice on good drive systems would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,
