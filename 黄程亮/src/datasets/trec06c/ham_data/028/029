hello,

i downloaded the freeware version of IC for DOS, and i believe it to
have a few problems.  these problems were not in another version that i
had on disk.  the problems are:  there are no stop_button(),
start_button() functions, only left_button(), and right_button(), which
cannot be used (i tried).  and the analog() functions return 255 all the
time.  i am not sure about the digital functions, or anything else for
that matter.  can anyone tell me where a good and tested version is
posted?  i appreciate any help in this matter.
