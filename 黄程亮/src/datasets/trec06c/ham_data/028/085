Subject: pcode 3.2 beta 1 with FP divide fix


Hi all,

With Jon Howell's help, we now have available a new version of IC pcode	
which fixes the intermittent floating point divide problem.  The divide
problem was caused by a bug in the floating point library used by the
pcode.

The pcode works for IC 3.1/3.2, and is currently considered beta-test
status.  If you'd like to download and try it, please get it from:

ftp://newtonlabs.com/pub/pcode-fp-fix

pcode_hb.s19:  Pcode 3.2 beta 1 for Handy Board
pcode_rw.s19:  Pcode 3.2 beta 1 for Rug Warrior
pcoderwp.s19:  Pcode 3.2 beta 1 for Rug Warrior Pro

Instructions for installation:

Please make a copy of your currently working pcode and then replace with
the appropriate pcode from our ftp site.  Then redownload your pcode.  The
bootup message should state "IC 3.2 beta 1" if you have successfully
installed the new pcode.

If you download the new pcode and try it, I'd really appreciate if you
could send mail to ic@newtonlabs.com letting us know if it worked, or
especially if something didn't work.  We'd like to get the pcode out of
beta and into our main distribution as soon as possible.

Thanks for your feedback, and we apologize for the bug.

-- Randy
