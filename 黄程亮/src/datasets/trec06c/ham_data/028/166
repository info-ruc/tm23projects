Hi,
I need additional port for the analog input. I have used up 7 analog ports
and 9 digital ports.  Hence, I need additional port from the HD. I came to
know that there are 4 extra analog port on the HD just above the analog
port 0 to 3. These additional ports are connected to PE0 to PE3 . HOW
should i command these ports to receive the input signal ? Eg,  if
analog(3) <127 {........}. Then, How should I use such command for PE0 to
PE3 to operate on the HD?

Besides, Is there any way to expand the input for the usage of digital port
since the 9 digital ports i have finished used up ?


rgds,
phillip
