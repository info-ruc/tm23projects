Subject: Building an IR/ultrasound co-processor... (LONG)

Hi,

I'm in the process of building a combination IR and ultrasound
co-processor for my HandyBoard based robot.  It's based on what Chuck
McManis did for his Cougar bot.  My version will have forward and backward
looking IR and include the sampling and filtering for two Polaroid 6500
ranging modules (also forward and backward looking).

I'm in the parts acquisition and planning phase right now and was hoping
to bounce some of my ideas off the list prior to placing an order with
DigiKey for the last of the parts.

I'm planning on using the PIC16C77 because it has 2 CCR pins (ranging),
SPI (communication with HandyBoard) and plenty of IO pins.

Rough layout:

  \ | /
-   *   -    Each of the lines represents a Sharp IS1U60 and a
             QEC233QT (\/-) or F5F1QT (|) pair.
-   *   -
  / | \      * = ultrasound transducer                       (base is 8x10in)

Questions:
   1) DigiKey doesn't sell the TPIC2701, any ideas on a replacement part
   that DigiKey sells (I need 10 channels total)?

   2) The IS1U60 datasheet has a 47 ohm resistor on the 5V supply and a
   47uF cap between 5V and ground with a note that this should be as close
   as possible to the sensor.  I was planning on running ~10in long wires
   from the PICProto to the IS1U60 and the IR LEDs, is this going to be a
   problem?  Do I need separate resistor/cap pairs for each sensor/led
   pair or can I just connect all the 5V and ground lines in parallel?

   3) The PICProto64 sheet shows C3 and C4 as polarized caps, for this I
   would want to use tantalum caps?

   4) Should the MCLR pullup resistor (R2) be 100 ohms?

   5) Where can I find a cheap (but not to slow) EPROM eraser?  We have a
   really nice programmer at work, but we don't use EPROMs so we don't
   have an optical eraser...
