These motors are exellent quality and very powerful the gears are metal and
the motors does not exed 300 mA @12V stalled.
I currently use the same motors on my robot and had no problems at all.  I
drive them using the motor drivers on the Handy Board and they don't even
get hot.

I highly recomend these motors!

jameco (www.jameco.com) has several new gear head motors in the
3-12v range with various gear ratios.  I ordered two for my latest project
and they seem to be solid and up to the task.  jameco's latest catalog also
has some robotic stuff including molded gears and chains to help with the
drive chain.  check it out...
