Subject: Re: source for pcode FP divide fix?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Here's the HB 2.81 pcode  with  floating point divide fix.  This new FLTDIV
routine  was giving to me by Jon Howell.  I just patched the original math
library with it and recompiled the pcode.  I'm pretty sure this is the same
fix that Newton Labs is using.  I'm currently testing the recompiled 2.81
version of the pcode and haven't seen any problems yet.   Please email me
if you see any bugs.  I did not change the HB start up message so make a
backup copy of your original version of the pcode.

If anyone is interested in the RugWarrior pcode version or a version with
the new Smooth PWM drivers, let me know and I'll compile those and put them
up.   

You can download a copy from my web site
