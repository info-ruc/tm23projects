The Bulldozer kit has a decent gearbox in it, however there are some
problems with it. The motors are 3v, so you really need to use an
alternate power supply. Also, the tracks are not very good at all and
will not last under any real use. the motors aren't very efficient
either and pull a lot of current for their small size. Overall i would
not recommend the bulldozer kit.
