I'll try to help you while Tim is on vaacation.  Tim will

sales@varesearch.com or call me directly at 1-888-LINUX-4U x125.

I've quoted you three Panasonic 21" monitors (20" viewable).
I also upgraded the video cards in two additional machines
(for three total) to drive those monitors.

Unfortunately, I forgot to adjust the number of keyboard, mice,
and keyboard/video/mouse cables.  I'll do that with a future 
quote.

I've raised the number of tape drives from 1 to 2.  It appears
from your quote that you were intending to put two 18GB drives
in each system.  If this is true, that won't work as originally
quoted with the machines that house tape drives.  The tape
drives are double-height.  Along with the CD-ROM, there isn't enough
room for two 18GB drives.  What I've done is quote two separate
external disk drive enclosures for the two tape drive systems.
For those two systems, we'll install the 18GB drives in the external
enclosures.  The other eight systems will have drives mounted
internally.

I also re-calculated your volume discount and have included
shipping charges for shipment to Virginia.
