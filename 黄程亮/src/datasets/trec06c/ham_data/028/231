Hi,

Does anyone know how to print messages to the IC's console window while
running
IC.exe.

Is it true that the handy board can only work when the LCD is plugged onto
the handy board ? It is because when ever it unplugged the LCD from the
handy board, the host computer losses synchronization with the handy board.

Thanks for helping...
