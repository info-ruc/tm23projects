Howdy Folks :)

I remember reading a web doc a while ago on how to convert servos so
their shafts can rotate more than 180 degrees... 

It was a nice doc, with pics, schematics, and everthing... but I lost
the URL... :(

Does any one know what doc am I talking about? Does anyone know this
doc's URL? Does anyone know any other docs on how to hack servos,
please?

I think it has something to do with a plastic pice that blocks the gears
from moving more than the what the manufacturer specified...

Thanks in advance,

Andre Philippi.
