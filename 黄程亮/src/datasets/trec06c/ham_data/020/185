Hi all, I also have a Handyboard for sale, but with a 20x4 display and
the IR demodulator. No casing, however. Price is just slightly more at
$235, includes shipping. It has a A0 processor. I'm selling it because
it's a bit "overpowered" for my application; I don't use the IR output,
motors nor the inputs. Email for info. Thanks!
