You all may recall my problems downloading to my board and receiving
a "config register set to 0x3c" error.  I am glad to report there was
a very simple solution, but it was a nightmare to debug.  So allow me
to share my wisdom so other unfortunate souls don't go through this.

You get this 0x3c error when you DON'T HAVE A COMMON GROUND between
the serial board and the handy board.  I got the same error for 2
different HBs and 3 different HC11 chips (using HBDL on Win95) so it
appears repeatable, not just a spurious floating value.  If you use DL 
or DLM you just get a "synchronization" error.  One for the books...
(or the mail archive).

Cheers, Skye.

PS: In case anyone is wondering how this came to be: I am using the
serial/charger board only for communication, not charging (thus I never
checked the charging ciruit).  In addition I am powering the HB on a
completely different circuit than the serial board, thus the common
ground is only needed for communication.  I had taken care of this,
but an electrical mishap broke the ground connection, and it was not
easy to discover this was the problem!
