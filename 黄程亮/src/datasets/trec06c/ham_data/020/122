Hi,
Currently, I using Seal Lead Acid batteries (1.2Amp hrs) of voltage 12 v to
drive my Stepper Motor and photoelectric sensor.

stepper motor using 3v and current is 2 Amp.
Sensor is using 12v and current is 35mA max. The total sensors used are 7
.BTW, What is the 5v supply in use for in the digital and Analog input ?

If I used the above requirement , Do I I need any interface to ampilfier
the voltage or current ? How to use the dc to dc converter ? 

Thank . Pls reply to me. The issue is urgent.
