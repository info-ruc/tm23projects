This question how has an answer in the FAQ.  Please see:

Following is the answer now on the FAQ page.

How much of the Handy Board's 32K memory is available for user
programs running under Interactive C?


Here is an approximate breakdown of how Interactive C makes use of the
Handy Board's 32K of RAM:

Purpose	Mem Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Runtime P-Code OS	7936 bytes
Stack space for user processes	6656 bytes
Buffer for interaction process	256 bytes
Buffer for printing	256 bytes
User program object code
plus user global variables	16320 bytes
available

Thus, about 16K of the memory is reserved for user code plus user
globals. Since Interactive C compiles into code for the runtime
virtual machine rather than into 68HC11 machine language, user IC
programs tend to be more compact than those compiled with traditional
compilers, partially offsetting the overhead of the IC system itself.
