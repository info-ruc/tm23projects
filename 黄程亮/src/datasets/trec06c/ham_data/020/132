I am trying to connect my Handyboard with a Motorola 68HC11A1FN chip
inside with a AD7858L- 12-bit ADC.

In my IC code I first write to the DDRD (Port D Data Direction Register) 
($1009) and activate SCK(bit4), MOSI(bit3), MISO(bit2).  
Then I write to SPCR (SPI Control Register  and set bits 7(SPIE), 6(SPE),
4(MSTR), 2(CPHA), 1(SPR1). 
Following I use serial_putchar() from the serialio.c library to initialize
the ADC... so far so good... no errors reported...
The ADC then is supposed to make a conversion and relay the data back to
the Handyboard via SPI. I use serial_getchar() 

v1 =(float)serial_getchar(); 

and the Handyboard crashes.. at least the heart on the LCD stops beating.. 
serialio.c is loaded on my handyboard! Was the serialio.c library written
for SPI?!?! If not then I guess I found my problem.. but if it is for SPI,
what am I doing wrong? Are my addresses correct? 

Can someone please tellme the right addresses for the following: 
DDRD, SPCR SPSR, SPDR. 

I have read various Motorola documentations and have not came out with a
distinct answer for my HC11A1FN chip. I have also found contradicting
values for the HC11 family so I am completly lost! The program did not
work when I tried to manually receive/send data through SPI. 

Please help!


All of the requests will be kindly appreciated!

Thanks in advance

Ilya
