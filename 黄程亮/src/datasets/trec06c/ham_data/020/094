Nyla,

Thank you for your suggestion regarding use of Family Tree Maker outline 
to report descendants of Louisa Jane Pedigo.  As you might guess, my tree 
is rather large and Pedigo is just one branch of it.  Also, thanks for the tip
about not including living people.  I decided to include three generations.

Thank you for your answer. It was the Burnett family in Patrick Co.
Va. I have been researching the Burnetts. Mine is John Burnett who
married Nancy Pendleton in 1806. So far I only have two of their
children Mary who married Jonathan Boyd and Samuel. They with Nancy
because John had died by 1828 moved to Russell Co. VA.
