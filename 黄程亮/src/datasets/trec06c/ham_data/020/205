Hello,
I really need help to solve the alogrithm in using the HD with interactive
C program .
 
Presently. I'm constructing a mobile robot to move within a battle field of
5metres by 5metres. In side the battle filed, the "mines" are visible with
diameter 300mm. It has a white reflector tape surround it at the
circumstance on the bottom of the mines. he mines are placed ramdomly in
the battle field.The robot CANNOT  bump into it. The robot has to avoid
from begining till the end . The robot has to cross from one end to the
opposite end as fast as possible. I"m using 2 stepper motors to drive the
robot. 
 
Pls take note there is another condition. Besides the "mines" , there are
obstacles totally in black (eg pails) around. The robot can bump into the
obstacle but has to move away and then search the finish end. 

I will be using 10  retro-reflective sensors (photoelectric). The working
Sensing range is 50mm away from the "mines" . When the robot sense the
"mines" at 50mm away,
it has to avoid and turn left or right and then forward again. 

Pls help me to solve the alogorithm when the robot move till
one location , the robot will know where it is within the 5m by 5m .

rgds,
phillip chia
