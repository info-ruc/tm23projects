"Following the successful launch of Clixme, we need to let everyone know about our product and the usages it provides to e-marketing vendors," stated Fotis Georgiadis, CEO of De Greko. "We are currently preparing a detailed National Campaign with the largest publications and portals in the country. We are quite confident that the American public will not only find out about the many usages of the Clixme platform, but eventually all the other developments De Greko have in mind."

"De Greko's team was inundated with requests for the new Clixme product that was launched yesterday on the De Greko website. "
"Our phones were ringing off the hook with people asking questions about how they could get the Clixme service for their own websites," said CEO Fotis Georgiadis.
