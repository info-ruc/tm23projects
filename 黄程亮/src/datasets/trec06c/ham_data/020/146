As no one has any insight into why I'm getting a config register value
of 0x3c when downloading pcode, I am into speculation mode.  

To refresh people's memory: All of DL, DLM, and HBDL refuse to download
the pcode to my chip, and HBDL reports that my config register is set
to 0x3c.  I have replaced my HC11 with a new one, and still get 0x3c.

Three questions then:

1. As the error occurs when I begin to write to RAM, is it possible that
   I have a bad RAM chip, and this returned config register value of 0x3c
   is somehow a result of that?  

2. Is there any other bit of hardware on the board that could poop out and
   result in HBDL returning a config register value of 0x3c?

3. Are there *any* suggestions for diagnostic tests I could perform to
   track down this error?

Cheers, Skye.
