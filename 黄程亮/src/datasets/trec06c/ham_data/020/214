I don't have a handy board but am considering getting one. I like what I
have seen so far! I have searched the FAQ and the mail list archives but
can't find the answer to my question.
How much of the 32k does Interactive C take up? 
OR MORE TO THE POINT
How much do I have left for my application code?
TIA
Dan
