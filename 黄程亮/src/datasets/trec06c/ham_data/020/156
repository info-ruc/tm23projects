Subject: beta testers wanted for LEGO MindStorms

Hi all,

LEGO is officially looking for beta testers for their new MindStorms
product scheduled to ship this fall.

I'm not sure what their selection criteria are, other than that you
must live in the States and have Pentium running Windows 95.  It's
a pretty good deal because not only do you get the kit before anyone
else, you don't pay for it, and you can keep it after the beta testing
is done!

Go to

  http://www.legomindstorms.com/betatest/

to sign up.  The web pages say they plan to start the testing on 
August 1st.

Fred
