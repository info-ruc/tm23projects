Does anyboady have experience using German Made Geared DC Motors
made by : FAULHABER. 12V/ 22b40.5
Motors have been salvaged from an old 'Plasmon'
Optical-disk-Jukebox
I have several of these identical motors that i want to use as
main traction drive.
Using the standard Handyboard Motor-outputs.
Will these motors put to much strain on the Board ?

Thanks
