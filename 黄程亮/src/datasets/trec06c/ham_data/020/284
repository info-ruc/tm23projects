I have a problem assembleing my hanyboard. I am at the stage where i am doing
the digital input circuit.
Before this I successfully loaded pcode_hb.s19 into the handyboard and the
interactive C message appeared. However, before i loaded pcode_hb.s19 and
turned the board on, the first line on the LCD appeared dark instead of
faintly. I am using the mac version of 6811 Downloader and in order for the
handyboard to accept the download i had to check "Ignore Serial Feedback On
Bootstrap". When this box was not checked i got the error message:Received bad
Echo from board wanted:142 got: 0 When i checked it the download worked and i
could run IC
Any help would be appreciated.
