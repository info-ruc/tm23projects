Hi, sorry to drift from the point of this mailing list
but I have a question for all the 80C196 users out=20
there.

Does anyone have ASM 96? I have been searching
for it for weeks now, without any luck. The only
thing I can find about it is updates to the manual.

Also, to all the 80C196 users, can you please reply=20
to this message with your email address. That way
if I have anymore questions I can email you directly
instead of emailing around 300 HC11 users.  :)

Thanks,
