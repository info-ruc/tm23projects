Hi LLya,

    Actually, descriptions of these functions
   are described in HB manual, at least mine
   has.

   peek() returns integer value for the given
   location passed in as the parameter. For
   example: 

   value = peek( 0x200);

   The peek returns the int. value starting
   at location 0x200.

   poke() is a function that does not 
   return any value but takes 2 parameters
   as the location and the value to put
   in at the location specified.

   For example:

   poke (0x200, 0x10);

   The above example will put value 0x10 at
   0x200 (i.e. one byte poke).

-Pandit
