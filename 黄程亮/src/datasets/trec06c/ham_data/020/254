WHOLE SUN FORTNIGHT Campaign Plans

August 12 - 25, 1998


Due to the unfortunate loss of communications with SOHO,
the Second Whole Sun Month Campaign will be reduced to
a Whole Sun Fortnight (WSF) Campaign. Detailed magnetic
field observations (JOP 81) will go on much as originally
planned. Each day there will be coordinated observations
between 1400 and 2200 UT in order to take advantage of the
time of greatest overlap of magnetic field observations.
Depending on solar conditions, each day a different "Target
of the Day" (TOD) will be chosen from among the following:

     Active regions (JOP 84) 
     Coronal holes 
     Filament channel (connected to decaying active region) 

As well as the TOD observations between 1400 and 2200 UT,
observations that do not temporally overlap the magnetic
field observations (NOO for non-overlap observations) will
be made for all three targets during the WSF period.

Coordinated IPS observations will be made throughout the
originally scheduled WSM2 period (August 1-28).

Details on the observing programs can be found at

http://sohops.gsfc.nasa.gov/whole_sun/HOMEPAGE/WSM2/plans.html

Observational details will be updated/added to over the next
few weeks.  Please send comments/observational updates
to gibson@thalia.gsfc.nasa.gov.

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE ALERTED AS TO THE TARGET OF THE
DAY DURING WSF, PLEASE EMAIL gibson@thalia.gsfc.nasa.gov
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
