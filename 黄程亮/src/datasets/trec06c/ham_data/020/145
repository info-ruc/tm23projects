That's the way I thought it had to be done.

What I was considering was routines that moved each leg the same short
distance (for straight line walking).  Walking would consist of very short
increments of movement. Now, this seems like it would move the robot in a
jerkey motion.  Depends on how short each movement was.

So, the way it might work would be to have variables for each leg
position (or pulse width for each leg position).  Starting position. To
that you would add a delta (same for each leg). So, that each time all
servos moved they would all move the same amount but since each might have
a different starting position, all legs would move in sync and the same
distance.  

The routine would do something like:
1) Set start position (initial pulse; all might be different)
2) Update each leg position register with delta
3) Wait 30-60ms (or whatever the update rate should be)
4) Update the new leg position (all would move together and the same
length of travel.

You would need one interrupt routine controlling the PRF.  I'm not sure
the best way to control the pulse width for each of the possible 12 legs.
Maybe a tight routine that simply started each pulse and output the value
of each of the leg position registers. Then it would decrement each every
x microseconds, When the count reached zero the pulse would end.

thanks for your help.

Side comment: When I first started thinking about this, I was trying to
think of something interesting and challenging.  I thought it might be
interseting to see if one could develop a four-legged robot that could 
run (move fast) and detect and jump over an obstacle.
