Erm... I am just guessing here, but, I don't think it would be
unreasonable to suspect that this particular LCD uses the Hitachi LCD
chipset that just about every LCD manufacturer utilizes.. and every LCD
chip fab'r emulates.  HM44780 is it?  I'm not sure.  However, if it does
indeed utilize this chipset, one merely presents a particular 8 bit code
to the instruction register and then for each particular CGRAM address
you present the 8 bit raster character image line for the character.
You would encode the image thusly:

  76543210  (bit locations in the aforementioned 5 bytes)
1 ........
2 .1....1.
3 .1....1.
4 .11111..
5 1.......


where the .'s I have depicted are zeros, and the 1's are.. *shock* ones.

So, the following bytes would form (something) like the character I think
you want:

{ 0x00,0x42,0x42,0x7C,0x80 }

I am not sure about the bit order, or the command to initiate the
character ram transfer...... or even where said character ram resides..
but.. that's the (extremely) general way to approach custom characters
with the (alleged) HM44780 chipset.
