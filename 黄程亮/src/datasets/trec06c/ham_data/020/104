Hello,
I need some help to go on in my project. The following are the question
needed to 
be answered :

1) Presently, I'm writing a program using Interactive C in my project. The
project 
    is involved a robot which has to be mobiled and move from one location
to 
    another. The robot has to move within an area of 5metres by 5 metres
only.
    Besides, the robot is using Stepper Motor to rotate the wheels. Within
the 
    5m by 5m areas, there are "mines" has to be avoided. Hence, please
advice 
    what type of ALGORITHM has to be written in the program especially the 
    every location of the robot has travelled.

2) In the handyboard, there are digital & analog inputs for the sensors.
What is the 
    difference between them when use in sensors?

3) Do I need to supply 5V to the digital & analog inputs in the handyboard
if  I use 
    at least 15 sensors to be interface to the Handyboard?Besides, the type
of sensors
    I use are retroreflective with 12 to 24v. Is there any problems, 
    Currently, the robot is using a 4.5v Nicad battery to drive 2 stepper
motor.

 Thank you very much. Please advice.

rgds,
Phillip chia
