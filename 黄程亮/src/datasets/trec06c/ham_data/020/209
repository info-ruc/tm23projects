May I suggest that you get a copy of a paper that Fred Martin wrote (should be
on his website, that is where I got it). It talks about the experience of several
of his students and their approaches and pitfalls is designing a robot not too
dissimilar to what you are doing. 

The bottom line is that many beginners approach a project like yours with misconceived
ideas as to the reliability of sensors, ease of programming and overall being
too optimistic. This may help you position yourself and make you aware of some
unforeseen problems (for example, you probably should NOT rely on the processor
telling the motors to move and then trying to keep track of your position based
of wheel movement).

Good luck,
Mike
