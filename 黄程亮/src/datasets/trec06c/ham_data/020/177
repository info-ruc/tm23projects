I have one extra HandyBoard that I will sell if anyone needs one.  It is
a fully assembled and tested board with Serial Interface Board and cases.  It 
has never been used in a project (about 2 months old).  I built two of these and 
find that I am only going to need one for now.  It has the 68HC11E1 micro 
installed.

It does NOT include an IR demodulator and I do NOT have an extra LCD 
display, so it does not include a display either.  These two missing items 
amount to about $15.

I will sell this for $225, includes shipping.  If interested contact me at: 
ipscone@halcyon.com or (206) 953-0784.
