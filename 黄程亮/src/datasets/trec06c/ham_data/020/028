You could use the effect of gravity force and a potentiometer (variable
resistant) to create
such thing. In fact if you use a joystick mechanism (or quadraphonic
double-potentiometer
volume control in the old day) in upside down position and have a heavy
weight attached
at the joystick end. Voila, you have a 2-dimensional inclinometer for cheap.
