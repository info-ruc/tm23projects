Hello all (especially Fred and other gurus),

I have some config register woes I can't resolve, and the mail archives
have only got me so far.  I had a little electrical "accident" and now
when I try to download pcode using HBDL in Win95, the boot loader
downloads fine, and then I get an error message telling me my config 
register is set to 0x3c, try again.  The config register box is set to
0x0c, but it is never reset.  If I set the box to 0x3c, then everything
downloads fine, but the pcode won't run (not surprisingly).

As neither "Download" or "Burn the Board" (what is the difference?) seem 
to reset this register, I have turned to DLM.exe and DL.exe without 
success.  I have tried:

> dlm config0c.s19 -eeprom -256  (I have an A1)
> dl config0c.s19 -eeprom
> dl pcode_hb.s19 -config_reg 0x0c

and almost every other combination of parameters possible.  Both programs
download the boot loader okay.  DLM always terminates with:

Synchronizing with board.......................failed.

while DL gives me:

Download successful
Board sync error: looking for prompt, got 0
Synchronizing with board
Board not responding

I have used my HB with no problems whatsoever for the last 6 months, so
I know my PC/serial port setup is fine.  I am curious, however, as
I have never seen 0x3c discussed before (it is always 0x0c, 0x0d, 0xff)
and wonder where this comes from.  Could it be a hardware issue?  I am
suspicious because I then replaced my A1 chip with an E2 chip that I
*believe* still works, and I still get the 0x3c error!  My power system
seems fine (I have 5v on board), but could I have a hardware error 
somewhere?  Any idea where to begin debugging?

Cheers, Skye.
