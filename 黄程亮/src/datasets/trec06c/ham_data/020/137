I have included site addresses that I have found useful.

http://www.frasco.demon.co.uk/   Maker of the Hexapod robot using a
buffer of sorts (D-type latches) for simultaneous control. Definitely
worth a look, he's put a lot of information into this site.

http://www.mil.ufl.edu/people/erik/  Creator of Active Bitmap Algorithm
and Servo16 program used in Robobug.
The above address also provides a link to the Walking Robot lab that he
worked for. The software and documentation for two versions of the HC11E
chip are link from these pages , their addresses are :
http://www.mil.ufl.edu/groups/walking/robo14c.zip (Robobug software)
http://www.mil.ufl.edu/people/erik/servo16.zip
http://www.mil.ufl.edu/people/erik/servo16c.zip
These files are all fairly small.


http://www.fzi.de/divisions/ipt/WMC/walking_machines_katalog/walking_mac
hines_katalog.html#begin_machines
This is a catalogue of various walking robots, I don't know how much use
this one will be.

Hope this helps
