Hi Joe&David,All,
      Let me explain what I would like my handyboard to do.

Guide a lawnmower  by detecting the border of cut and uncut grass.

Monitor a row of 16 +or- ir emitter/detector pairs placed about every two
inches to report to the motor control board for action to be taken.

The program should read each sensor several times per second.
1s could indicate uncut  and 0s for cut grass and store in memory.
Tally the 1s and 0s every second or so.
If the number was greater than or equal to 2 the final number stored would
be 1. If the summed value was less than 2 then a value of 0 is stored. the
grass border would be located where the 1s ended and 0s started.

 An artical appeared in Radio-Electronics some years ago explaining this
idea called "Build the Lawn Ranger".   Michael A. Tyborski was kind enough
to send me a copy.
 I would like to adapt the handeyboard for this control but lack experience
writing code and the project looks overwhelming only due to the programming
part.

                                                                    Thanks
Again
                                                                    Terry P.
