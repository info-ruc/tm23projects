I have tried the official Handy Board Sonar hookup from the Web sie and 
didn't get very good results.  Most of the time,
the sonar would produce seemingly random numbers (including negatives).
Every once in a while, it would give a constant value of 302-600 when 
something was put close but didn't seem to change as the object was moved 
closer or farther away.  The only variation (I think) I did was used
2.5A diodes instead of 3.0A.  

Also, I cut the motor power trace to use an external battery.  Do you still
recommend using the "official" hookup by basically tying the sonar's 
V+ and Gnd to external battery (9V)?

If you could help, I'd appreciate it greatly.  From looking at the mail,
it seems most people get it to work easily.  I have not been so lucky!
