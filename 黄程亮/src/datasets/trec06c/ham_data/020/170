Serial libraries are wwriten for Serial port,not for SPI port! Are you
needing use the spi like a standard oitput port or like a SPI (synchronus
serial port)???? Is the device spi compatiible? If yes, you need the portd
to work like a SPI port. if not just use like a standard i/o port , and use
the imagination ... :)
