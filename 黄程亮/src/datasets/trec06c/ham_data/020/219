I have a 'sealed rechargeable' Lead-Acid battery. It's specs are 12 volts at
2.0 Ah.

It also has a nifty chart on the outside saying:

| Charging @ 20 Deg. C | Voltage Regulation | Initial Current |
|     Standby Use     |   13.50-13.80V      |    No Limit       |
|      Cyclic Use      |   14.4-15.0V        |     .5A Max      |

Now, What would be the proper way to recharge this battery?
What voltage at what amperage?
AC or DC?

Thanks alot!
