in short, the answer is:  

  "you can't use 3 to 4v motors with the Handy Board."

basically, these motors are cheap toy motors that are incredibly noisy
from an electrical standpoint, plus they want to draw far more current
than the Handy Board's motor drivers can deliver.

your options are:

1.  get better motors, ones rated for 9 to 12v with 1 ampere of
current draw (e.g., LEGO motors)

2.  design your own motor driver circuit and run your 3 to 4.5v motors
from that.

just reducing the HB's batt voltage wont' do it, as you have found,
because of the noise problem inherent in these cheap motors.
