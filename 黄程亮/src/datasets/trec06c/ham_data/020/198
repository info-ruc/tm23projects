Hello,

I have developed a machine code programming system for programming 
the handyboard.
It is similar to the Buffalo routines on the Motorolla 68HC11 chips.

It allows a relatively simple way of machine code interaction to the 
display.

The program and documentation can be found at:
http://132.234.46.5/Programs/


If you would like example Assembly code that prints data to the 
screen, then I am attaching an example text code with this Email.
