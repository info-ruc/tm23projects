The paper referred to is at

  ftp://cherupakha.media.mit.edu/pub/el-publications/CiP/CiP_Martin.pdf

My personal advise is that you simply *get started*.  hook up your
motors and start driving your robot around.  see what it can do, how
it moves.  then connect sensors and gain an intuition for their
performance.

you definitely DO NOT want to design this project top-down (i.e.,
thinking really hard and planning your solution) if you do not yet
have experience with the problem domain (i.e., a mobile robot in a
semi-structured playing field).
