Greetings,

I was the one who worked on the fileserver. I just had a look and it
appears to be running the correct kernel.

WRT compiling the kernel:
The config I used was left in /usr/src/linux. You can change the limit,
make clean, and then make the new kernel with the same configs.
You may also need new ethernet module (bcm5700). It's source is in
/usr/src

Finally, the bproc modules (bproc vmadump and ksyscall) are in
/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES/bproc-2.2-pyro1

I can certainly do the kernel mod. Oddly enough, I don't know how much I
cost these days :-), I will inquire w/ Markus on that and any other
options available.

G'day,
sjames
