Hi Jerry,

I noticed that changed files on mfv1 on Nov 4, in the period from
2:30-3:30pm. 
If a new package was installed, it's ok, but if not that I need to
investigate if someone broke in.

Do you know if any change was done on mfv1?
The changed files are:
    /etc/cups/classes.conf
    /etc/cups/cupsd.conf
    /etc/cups/printers.conf
    /etc/printcap
    /etc/modules.conf
   /etc/sysconfig/hwdata
   /etc/sysconfig/soundcard

Seems like soundcard or printer was added or modified.

Sasko
