Kleinberg's paper shows us that it is possible to route efficiently in 
a decentralized system even without a strict structural underpinning.  
Kleinberg's model shows that it is possible to route a message towards 
a destination in a grid network with only order log n^2 hops if one has 
the following information:

* A set local contacts within some distance and a set of some long 
range contacts chosen at random (with probability proportional to the 
inverse square of their distance from the source)

* A correspondance of message to a location within the network and the 
location of all contacts.

The importance of inverse square above is intuitive when one considers 
that the number of possible contacts should grow squarely with 
increasing distance.  Given this information, Kleinberg's paper shows 
that the simple algorithm of forwarding the message to the contact 
closest to the destination should achieve an expected routing time 
proportional to the log of the number of nodes in the network.

It is unlikely that a P2P system will have the same concept of locality 
as Kleinberg's grid. What is important to take away from the paper is 
that a small world property will only emerge in a system in which nodes 
maintain in addition to their local knowledge, a small set of long 
range links, and more importantly, that the frequency of these long 
range contacts must correlate closely to some notion of their density 
(i.e., in the grid model, the probability of adding a node at a certain 
distance was proportional to the number of nodes within that distance.)

Hence, if we have an unstructured P2P network (like Gnutella or 
Freenet), we can only expect it to route effectively if it has the 
above mixture of local and long range links. But if it does, we can 
perhaps achieve route lengths logarithmic in the size of the network, 
as good as Pastry or Chord! Note, however, that neither of the above 
two systems should be expected to exhibit such a property, as even if 
their link structure follows the small world relation, they lack a 
correlation between the "location" of a query and the "location" of a 
node. It is difficult to see how one would even define such concepts in 
Gnutella.

In Freenet, of course, keyspace specialization should eventually 
approach this property.  The second paper for today, by Theodore Hong, 
emphasizes this point. Short paths do exist in Freenet between randomly 
selected pairs of nodes, and the Freenet graph is certainly connected 
(or close enough that it doesn't matter in any interesting way).  Their 
simulation of Freenet does exhibit very short path lengths (6 Freenet 
hops) albeit under a lot of communication. If, however, we take away 
the behavior that Freenet always routes towards nodes who are closest 
to the destination in the keyspace, the median path length remains at 
50 Freenet hops.  In effect, this removes Kleinberg's second 
requirement above.

The third paper for today tackles a very different subject: What is the 
real behavior of nodes in File Sharing systems? Such information is 
important as it tells us what kind of expectations we may place on a 
P2P system design (i.e. how stable do we expect the network to be in 
terms of node uptime):

* Bandwidth measurements are fairly encouraging: More than half of file 
sharing users seem to have bandwidth measurements greater than 64 kbps.

* Uptime is harder to measure as quality of service seems to be 
important to system life time measurements. Napster gave an arguably 
better experience than Gnutella even though their end-user modes of 
operation were much the same (time in a search, get a file). But 
whereas the best 20% of Napster nodes have an uptime of 83% or more, 
the best 20% of Gnutella have an uptime of only 45% or more.

* Free riders are definitely a problem: As many as 25% of Gnutella 
users are free riding. Like the American economy, Gnutella is skewed, 
with 7% of its users offering more files than all of the other users 
combined.
