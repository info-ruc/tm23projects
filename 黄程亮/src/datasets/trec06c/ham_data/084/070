greetings,

Apologies for the delay getting back to you. It appears that there are
two ways to solve this problem.

The first would be to re-compile the 2.2.x kernel with the task limit
raised. That would certainly reduce the problem and provide for minimal
disruption of the system.

The other soloution to the problem is to upgrade to our new Nimbus
distribution. Nimbus is based on the Los Alamos Clustermatic and uses the
2.4.19 kernel. 2.4.x naturally has a much larger task/thread limit since
it's dependance on the size of a TSS segment has been removed.

It is based on RedHat 7.2. 

Other improvements include a batch scheduling system, lighter weight
system monitoring (with the same information available) and improvements
in the automatic addition of new nodes. 

Further information is available from www.clustermatic.org.

Please let me know if you have any questions and which way you want to go
with this, and we can make necessary arrangements.

G'day,
sjames
