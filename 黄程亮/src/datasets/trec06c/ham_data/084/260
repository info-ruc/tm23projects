The three papers today present a view of the structure and
characteristics of P2P networks.  The questions for today's papers ask
whether structured or unstructured P2P systems perform better.  We are
further asked about the design constraints of a P2P system.

The Small World paper describes the characteristics a network must
have to allow a decentralized algorithm to find a good short path to a
given node.  It gives proofs of the properties required.  With respect
to the proposed questions, it shows that given the dimensionality of
the space, there are a particular number of long-distance contacts
that an average node must have to find these short paths with
reasonable probability.  A design constraint of a P2P system is thus
that the methods for establishing contacts within the system must
encourage these kinds of links and in these proportions so that the
small world property can be established.  It shows that an
unstructured P2P system might perform at least as well as a structured
system by taking advantage of the small world property.

The chapter "Performance" from the P2P O'Reilly book makes a
comparison of Freenet and Gnutella and discusses the applicability of
the small world effect to their structure.  Both are unstructured P2P
systems, but with significant differences in their performance
characteristics.  As above, the small world property is exploited in
Freenet to get relatively small pathlengths for queries.  A structure
is suggested for Gnutella which would make a hierarchy of peers, which
could then overcome the problems it has with its broadcast search.  It
does suggest that at least with respect to searchability, the
unstructured network labors under a significant disadvantage.

The measurement paper from UWashington measures Napster and Gnutella
in terms of the characteristics that their users possess.  They show
that many of the standard assumptions about the users of P2P systems
do not hold in practice.  Their main result, however, is that the
heterogeneity of these two P2P systems is very high, and that any such
system which wishes to improve its performance needs to use
information about the characteristics of nodes in the network
(preferably by discovering them itself, since they also discovered a
significant amount of misrepresentation in the system) to direct
queries and downloads.  

This result suggests that the small world property discussed in the
two papers above is a useful property but not sufficient to guarantee
good performance of an unstructured system over a structured one.
Indeed, the remedies proposed by this paper would be more easily
implemented on a more structured system, since the less structure that
exists, the more times the work involved in making these measurements
would have to be repeated.

The design constraints revealed by this study are particularly
striking in terms of the uncooperative nature of the participants and
the short periods of time for which they remain on the network.  A
short charaterization of these properties might be that a significant
fraction of the members of the network lie about their attributes, are
only there to get resources, and only stay on the network for short
periods of time.  The users tend to have low enough bandwidths on
average that many cannot function as servers.
