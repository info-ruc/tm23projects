Greetings,

I am happy I could help.

A long question deserves a long answer, so here goes :-)

You were on the right track by putting the Xlib in with the regular libs.

The issue is that slave nodes recieve their files from the master's /lib
and /usr/lib directory.

This is a configuration option in /etc/beowulf/config.

Addint /usr/X11R6/lib there, then restarting the cluster should make it
find the library.

It is normally not included since it's unusual for a cluster app to want
to use X (other than the root process of a parallel visualization
app, that is). 

This is not necessarily a problem, just an unusual situation that needs
configuring. Depending on exactly how it does it's thing, you may also
need to set the DISPLAY environment variable explicitly to 192.168.1.1:0

It may also be necessary to use xhost to permit the node to use the
Xservices on the master. For your example of node 3, you would want 
xhost +n3 

before running root. (A useful note, the nss libs are patched so that
n<node_number> will correctly resolve to the node's IP address.

If you are wanting to have the X connection re-directed to a workstation
somewhere, we'll need to set the master up to forward outgoing connections
from compute nodes so the X connection can get through.

G'day,
sjames
