Dr. Gilfoyle,

I noticed that pscm1 and physxcd have their time drifted a little.
Do you want me to setup the NTP protocol on both so they will synchronize
with our Campus time servers?

Will you be in town this Wednesday again? If so can we meet  so I can get
the passwords for the other Scientific Workstations in your lab.

Sasko
