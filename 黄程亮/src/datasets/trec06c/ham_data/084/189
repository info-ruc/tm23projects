Hi Jerry,

I can certainly stop by. What time you will be in the lab?
By the way the backup finished Friday, so I'll send James an e-mail to go
ahead with next step.

/usr/home is backed up on fileserver:/data2/pscm1_backup/home.tgz
/usr is backed up on fileserver:/data2/pscm1_backup/usr.tgz

We have those 2 on tape also. 
/ and /var are only on tape.

So we have complete backup.

Sasko
