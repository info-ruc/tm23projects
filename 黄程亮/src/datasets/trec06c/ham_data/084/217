Hi Jerry,

You certainly worked a lot to make everything 'roll' again.
I don't have any clear solution for the problem you described - I don't
have enough Root experience to figure it... Maybe there is a 'root.config'
type of info file and it looks for it in the old place?

I hope you can come to the seminar talk I'll give this afternoon (4pm)
at UR. You'd enjoy my plea for JLAB!
