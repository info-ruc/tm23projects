I power off some of the nodes that were not responding. I was using the
switch on the machine. It has a 4 seconds delay before actual power cut-off.

And I was bringing machines slowly. Sometimes when multiple nodes were
coming up, they will just hang.
And that command bpctl -S <node> -s up does not work when they are
rebooting. 
I was watching the log for the machines we did that yesterday, and all of
them did not finish booting up. BProc was broken on all of them.

Conclusion: More patience is needed with this beast.
