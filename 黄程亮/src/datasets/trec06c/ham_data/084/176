Greetings,

The secondary is ready to be a master now. All it needs is for the cluster
to be powered down and to have the master's connections to the cluster
moved to it.

I will need someone there to power on/reset nodes as needed to rebuild the
cluster and finalize the configuration. once this is done. The null-modem
cable will be a good thing to have handy as well.

G'day,
sjames
