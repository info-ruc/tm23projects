Dr. Gilfoyle,

>From the command line, I understand that you ran ssh-add on pcsm1.
You have to ran that command from your client machine (presumable remote)
from where you want to login into pscm1. That is to be the machine where you
generated your ssh keys.

In the setup steps that I sent to you, step 4 is to be done on the remote
machine (i.e. your home machine).
Maybe my description was a little fuzzy. In step 4, "after you logged in"
means on the "client" machine from where you will initiate ssh session to
the pscm1.

hi sasko,

   i tried out the directions below and got through most of it
successfully
until i did ssh-add. then i got the following.

pscm1:gilfoyle> ssh-add
/home/gilfoyle/.ssh/identity: No such file or directory
pscm1:gilfoyle> 

any ideas on how i messed up?
