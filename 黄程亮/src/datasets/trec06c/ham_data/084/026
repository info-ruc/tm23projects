Darren,

One of the NWP board members is Bill Wilcke - he's in the Biosystem and Ag
Engineering Dept at UM.  He sent this note  -- "Just by chance, a guy from
Wisconsin called me about a project in the Phillipines where someone is
trying to match microturbines with grain dryers. He didn't have a lot of
details, but it might be worth having Darren list other places in the world
where people are experimenting with microturbines."  Please include other
examples you are aware of  in your response.
