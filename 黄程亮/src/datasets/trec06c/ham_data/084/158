Greetings,


For minimum disruption, I propose that the upgrade proceed in several
steps.

1. Secondary master shut down and disconnected from cluster (ethernet
cable).

2. re-configure BIOS to boot from CDROM, then hard drive

3. Install RedHat 7.2 (later versions not advised at this time)

4. Make sec. master available on public network for access by LinuxLabs.

5. I will install Nimbus enhancements on secondary master and do
preliminary configuration.

6. back up all user data on master and compute nodes to fileserver.

7. Primary master shut down. re-designated as secondary master

8. Secondary master connected to cluster and re-designated as master.

9. Final configuration. Some local intervention will be needed to boot
compute nodes. 

10. new sec master set for PXE boot in BIOS and booted.

11. I will re-configure sec master. Primary's image will be copied to
secondary.

For step 3 (RedHat install), a special partitioning will be required.

use fdisk to partition hda! Partition as follows (order IS important!)
hda3 500M
hda2 500M
hda1 (as desired for scratch, not less than 1G)
hda4 extended, rest of drive

hda5 3G
hda6 rest of drive

Note that 5 and 6 are extended partitions inside hda4.

The partitions should be created in the order listed here in order to make
sure booting will work! Druid will tend to get it wrong.

Then, edit the partitions to specify filesystem and mountpoint as follows:

hda1 ext3fs /scratch
hda2 swap
hda3 ext3fs /
hda5 ext3fs /var
hda6 ext3fs /usr

Package installation:
Select Custom install.
Keep all default selected packages except for dialup

In addition, select:

NFS server
development tools
kernel development
firewall/router

You may also select any other task/package sets desired.

In firewall setup, allow at least ssh (others as you see fit)
eth2 MUST be set as a trusted interface.

Continue with installation as usual. Send me and Markus IP address and
(temporary) root password when ready (step 4).

G'day,
sjames
