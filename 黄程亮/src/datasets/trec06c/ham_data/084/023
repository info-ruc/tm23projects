Hi,

So, a few of us have been talking about a "Restaurant Club" which would be 
a weekly dinner at some restaurant.  The rules are simple:

- visit a restaurant only once
- every thursday:  this is to allow for people with significant others who
                   have lives.
- dutch treat:  you pay for yourself
- "Steen's 25% rule" -- everyone adds their amount up, adds 25% for 
  tax/tip to it, and pays up.

The primary point of this club is the food, food, food.  A secondary point 
is social interaction.  You can bring potential significant others for 
group review (I can imagine all sorts of really bad pick up lines, here, 
but those are reserved for monkeyluv.)  It's Dutch treat (thank god we 
have no Dutch amongst us) because that way, you can go and get a salad if 
that's all you want and not have to pay $20 for it (as it once happened 
to a friend.)  

So, we need some "permanent members" who'd always be present, otherwise, 
the whole thing falls apart.  I did this both in Champaign and Durham, 
and I've had my share of whiners who want to know what kind of food we're 
having, and even _who's_ going, and wah wah wah, before they make up their 
minds....

Of course, non-permanent "observers" are welcome.  Once the club gets 
an established track, I'm sure more and more people will come.  But we 
need to get it going, hence the need for permanent members!

At any rate, feel free to suggest other people for founding.  And tell 
me if you want to be a founding member.  If we can, we should go for the 
first dinner tomorrow night.

P.S.  need a better name:  TND = Thursday Night Dinners sounds too much 
like APL.
P.P.S.  it'll be great!  we'll make a website, write reviews, get a 
startup going, go to VC's and get a gazillion dollars... oh wait... damn!

P.P.P.S.  Pradeep:  you're the local "real graphics people" rep...  Anne:  
you do same for Math Dept.
