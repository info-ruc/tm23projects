Hi,

I rebooted the pscm1 and all the nodes. I was bringing them up 10 at at
time.
The current status is:
1. node 8 is down. It hangs during POST just after HDD is detected. The
null-modem cable is currently attached to that node.
2. some of the nodes would not boot right away. They ususaly hang just after
bpslave is started during recv: /lib/libc-2.2.4.so
   Probably some transient network problems, since they boot up after couple
of retries.
3. Secondary master (node 48) hangs during boot, at "Adding swap space"
4. The FAN led is off on the Primary Master (does it mean that internal
processor's fan does not work, since the main power fan was blowing air?
5. T1 led on node 45 is off. What this led is saying?

Sasko
