In flight you can refuel, because space between the stars is prettty much 
empty, and no fule would be worth slowing down to get.

Once in another starsystem (i.e. where your going) you csan refuel from 
materials in the solar system.  Comet cores, gas giants and their moons, etc. 
 Or solid asteroids (not all fusion fuels are gasses).

Legal Pad StationeryScrap The Shuttle Program
by Carlton Meyer
Editor G2mil.com
Richmond - Nov 01, 2002

The US military considers control of outer space vital to future warfare.
Spaceprojects.com noted that page 18 of this Commerce Department report
(pdf) documents how the USA slipped to just 29% of the world's launch market
share in the year 2000, even though we had 48% of it in 1996, and apparently
all of it the decade before.

How did this happen if NASA has a larger space budget than all other
civilian space agencies combined, as well as its Congressional mandate to:
"seek and encourage, to the maximum extent possible, the fullest commercial
use of space"? How did some countries evolve from non-players in space two
decades ago into dominant commercial players today?



Much of the blame falls upon the Space Shuttle program. As we "celebrate"
the 25th anniversary of the shuttle disaster, no not the Challenger
explosion but the whole program, let us review reality. The shuttle is far
more expensive than expendable rockets used for the Apollo program the
1960s. The orbiter and solid rocket boosters are recovered for reuse, but an
army of engineers must inspect and rebuild them for the next mission.



As a result, plans for 100 shuttle missions a year have fallen to around
four, costing $550 million each and employing 30,000 people. The shuttle was
a good effort in the 1970s which developed some new technology, but that
phase ended. Unfortunately, NASA invented the "Space Station" as an excuse
to keep the shuttle program funded forever.



While the shuttle eats up $4 billion a year in NASA funding, only $1 billion
was devoted to the shuttle replacement, the X-33, before senior NASA
officials admitted the concept was unworkable. Experts told NASA that the
X-33 just needed a rocket sled or pneumatic ground assisted launch, but NASA
ignored them. Congress then gave NASA $4.8 billion over several years to
develop a replacement for the shuttle.



However, this Strategic Launch Initiative (SLI) became a game to keep the
shuttle jobs program going, and only produced some complex artistic drawings
devoid of any details like mass or engine type. At a World Space Congress
panel on space operations last month, veteran shuttle flight director Wayne
Hale discounted SLI concepts as ungrounded in reality. On October 22nd, NASA
postponed the next phase of SLI indefinitely.



SLI is in limbo because the focus became minute improvements in rocketry to
produce the RS-83 to replace the shuttle's main engines, and the RS-84 as
expensive fly-back boosters to replace the shuttle's solid rocket boosters.
Now NASA is breaking the bad news to America with a message like: We tried
really hard, but couldn't find a better method. Luckily, we did discover
ways to improve the current Space Shuttle, so we can upgrade that system and
extend it for another twenty years.



The United Space Alliance (USA) is pleased. This patriotic sounding group is
a cover for the two aerospace giants (Boeing and Lockheed-Martin) who share
one billion dollars a year in funding to "manage" the shuttle program. They
now want billions more for Space Shuttle II to upgrade everything and
replace the two solid rocket boosters with RS-84 liquid fly-backs. However,
the shuttle has a payload of only ~50,000 lbs.



So if you use two flyback boosters, you add two sets of landing gear, two
sets of stub wings, and two jet engines per booster, plus more fuel to
launch this extra deadweight, and the shuttle payload goes to zero. This
proposal does not bring back the expensive fuel tank either, leaving one
unsure if USA is incompetent or mismanaged.



The highly successful Apollo program ended after several trips to the moon,
yet the unsuccessful shuttle program continues pointless "missions" which
normally involve a public relations gimmick. A school teacher was sent, old
former senator John Glenn, and the last mission was notable for a
"shuttlecam" providing a lift off view, as well the third soybean
experiment.



Even the Simpson's cartoon series made fun of NASA by selecting Homer for a
"regular guy" mission, along with an ant experiment which goes awry. The
Russians are not paying for their share for the Space Station, and have
resorted to selling trips to billionaires, celebrities, and are now
negotiating to host TV game shows in space. NASA has given up on pretending
that shuttle missions involve science and now proclaim they are important
for international relations.



As the shuttle orbiters age, maintenance becomes even more expensive, and
many experts believe its just a matter of time before another shuttle blows
up due to its complex vertical launch method.



Americans in their 30s watched shuttle launches as young children. Now NASA
wants to keep the program going so they can one day watch shuttle launches
from their retirement home. Then they wonder why there is no enthusiasm for
space programs in the nation or Congress. If the shuttle hangs on for
another 80 missions, does anyone expect anything to come from them?



Perhaps NASA should build a "Sea Station" 1000 feet below the sea and use
submarines to take foreigners and other salaried government tourists on
"missions" to conduct "experiments" and set "endurance records" while
"improving international relations". This idea may seem crazy, but it would
be much cheaper than the shuttle program and accomplish just as much.



The Apollo program ended when America realized that expensive adventures to
collect moon rocks was pointless. Can anyone name a spectacular scientific
discovery from shuttle missions? Its become a jobs program and a public
relations campaign to hide a lack of progress.



In contrast, just $1 billion in seed money helped Boeing build the Delta IV
and Lockheed-Martin the Atlas 5, the first new expendable rocket systems in
over 20 years.



Imagine what could happen if the $4 billion a year and 30,000 shuttle
experts were diverted to R&D? Imagine the panic at NASA after cancellation
of the shuttle program shatters their comfortable academic climate and
everyone realizes that a superior method must be developed fast, lest
Congress deems them inept and cuts funding.



Innovative ideas like maglev launch, nuclear engines, and the space elevator
require major funding. Some top level physicists now agree that anti-gravity
devices like the 512kV rotator can reduce the effects of gravity by spinning
electrons, but they can't secure funding for research.



Plans for pneumatic assisted launch have been around for years, but never
funded. A large rail launch demonstrator requires a billion dollars, or
funds for just two shuttle missions. NASA may soon cancel the promising
VARISM plasma engine research project citing a lack of funds.



Unfortunately, little technological progress is expected unless NASA
management and shuttle funding is diverted from the continual burden of
getting yet another shuttle safely off the ground.



The US Air Force has become so frustrated by NASA's focus on the shuttle
that it wants to build its own manned spacecraft. Until a major
technological breakthrough allows a new form of space launch, all we have
today is chemical rocket power that can provide just a few percent payload
by weight compared to their overall size.



A massive rocket-powered horizontal launched spaceplane may work, but it
would cost billions to build, must be several times larger than a 747, and
may cost so much to launch and maintain that it erases the savings of being
reusable, just like the shuttle. If you add wings, landing gear and engines
to bring any spacecraft or fly-back booster back to Earth for reuse, that
extra weight eliminates the payload.



You can't just make a bigger spacecraft because that requires bigger wings,
landing gear and engines. So the only way a reusable rocket powered
spacecraft can work is with a ground assist launch to Mach 1-2 up a
mountainside. This is possible today, as the Sky Ramp Technology website
explains. However, funding for Sky Ramps and new technologies will remain
tight so long as the shuttle program consumes the attention and funding at
NASA.

Once I knew where I was going, but now I have  forgotten.  Sometimes my mind
wanders.  Sometimes it goes alone, and other times it takes me along...this
isn't one of those times...

Subject: Re: starship-design: Scrap The Shuttle Program
Date: Sat, 9 Nov 2002 22:33:22 EST

The guy had some good points up until he got to nonsence like below.

The shuttles expensive because it was never made to be affordable and 
easy/cheap to maintain, and it flys too seldom to cover its support costs.  
Curing eiather doesn't require new technology -- much exotics this laglev 
lauchers and such.  Hell they are likely to raise costs further.

Problem is no one want to invest the money for better cheaper launchers, 
without some serious market on the other end.  And one thing NASA adamently 
proved with the X-33 program, was that they did NOT want a new cheap launcher 
that wouldn't require a fraction of the support staff they now have.  It 
would gut NASA staf size and budget, and hence political support.  It would 
also likely allow comercial companies to do launches with their own launchers 
- without needing a big expensive Kennedy space center, and NASA, to do it.

Lee went into some detail about how NASA's percentage of all launches keeps getting smaller. To me, this looks like a function of the number of countries and corporations wanting to put communications satellites in orbit -- I'm guessing that they find it cheaper and quicker than they could get the service from NASA, and without the extra red tape as well.

He also seems to disparage the Russians for selling astronaut tickets to a few rich folks who just want an exotic vacation trip. Hey, more power to 'em! The Russian economy is a mess, and by some accounts, their government went straight from Communism to Mafia, so if this is a way for them to fund some space work, why not? True, they haven't been pulling their weight with the ISS, but again, their economy . . . well, they're still fighting Chechens. Who wants to bet that NASA won't get shaved a bit to make room in the billfold for kicking Sadam's ass? Cruise missiles are $1M each, last I heard.

Bottom line of all this is -- FOLLOW THE MONEY!

Keep looking up,

Curtis

Well, to start with, it wasn't my point to make, it was a news article
written by someone else, I just posted it to the group,

Second, if I remember correctly, growth in the space launch business was
practically flat this year.

For my part, I would be happy to see NASA out of the Space Launch business
entirely. I can see valid reaons for DOD to retain indigenous launch
capability, but NASA needs to be out of the launch business.

  Lee went into some detail about how NASA's percentage of all launches
keeps getting smaller. To me, this looks like a function of the number of
countries and corporations wanting to put communications satellites in
orbit -- I'm guessing that they find it cheaper and quicker than they could
get the service from NASA, and without the extra red tape as well.

  He also seems to disparage the Russians for selling astronaut tickets to a
few rich folks who just want an exotic vacation trip. Hey, more power to
'em! The Russian economy is a mess, and by some accounts, their government
went straight from Communism to Mafia, so if this is a way for them to fund
some space work, why not? True, they haven't been pulling their weight with
the ISS, but again, their economy . . . well, they're still fighting
Chechens. Who wants to bet that NASA won't get shaved a bit to make room in
the billfold for kicking Sadam's ass? Cruise missiles are $1M each, last I
heard.

  Bottom line of all this is -- FOLLOW THE MONEY!

  Keep looking up,

Course the question really is, why have we no competative launch services.  
Likely its just NASA preserving turf, and not wanting to fund research to 
unseat themselves.

A better question is how to start a industry big enough to attrack 
commercials enough to shove NASA out of the way.

NASA is a government agency.  Cost means nothing, politics means everything.

Also the NASA's budgets to small to mater.  Dept of Ag spends moer then that 
keeping food of the market to keep up prices.

What I don't understand, is that if anyone REALLY wants the X-prize  and
intends on doing anything with the hardware after they win (or even if they
don't), why don't they but the rights to the DC-X?

It was FLYING.

It is closer than anything else out there to managing SSTO, quick turn
around and minimal ground crew. Heck, even during testing the ENTIRE ground
crew, monitoring crew and engineers on site were less than a tenth of a
typical shuttle launch. Worse if you factor in all of the people involved in
refurbing the shuttles between trips

Actually it was closer to a thousanth those durring a shuttle flight.  

The estimates were a full production DC-X like SSTO would take 100 -200 man 
days of labor to turn around between flights.  Suttle takes over a thousand 
man years!!!

It was part (actually, the first) of the DC series and was never meant to
actually reach orbit. Nevertheless, it was under budget, on time and showed
actual promise of becoming a real system someday. Its only problem was that
it wasn't sexy. OBTW, McDonnell Douglas was the contractor and not
surprisingly, it was managed by the Air Force at first.

The DC-XA performed a 24 turn around between flights just before it was
cancelled. They must have pulled one heck of an all nighter!

I know.  I knew folks on the project.

McDonnell Douglas was forced toi murge with Boeing.  I.E. Boeing, who never 
liked the idea, now controls all of the DC-X data.

McDonnell Douglas estimated they could get production DC-3 (productino SSTO 
cargo craft) rolling off a assembly line in 3 years and $3 billion.   But 
thats way to much for a X prize contestant to come up with.

Legal Pad StationeryNASA wants space plane, new shuttle

Thursday, November 14, 2002 Posted: 1:39 PM EST (1839 GMT)




WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA is proposing to spend $2.4 billion over the next
four years to design a new orbital space plane to ferry astronauts between
Earth and the International Space Station.



In an amendment to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
proposed 2003 budget, agency officials for the first time set a firm figure
of $6.6 billion for completing assembly of the basic orbiting space station.
That would bring the U.S. share of the international project to less than
$25 billion, officials said.



The precise cost of the space station, a project started during the Reagan
administration, has been an unsettled issue for years between NASA and
Congress. After the agency announced last year that it faced cost overruns
that could reach more than $600 million, Congress put a $25 billion cap on
the project.



Sean O'Keefe, a former federal budget officer, was named NASA administrator
in January with specific instructions from the White House to define and
control the costs of the space station and other NASA programs.



The core components of the plan

In the budget amendment proposal, O'Keefe describes what he calls a "new
integrated space transportation plan" that would complete the core
components of the space station by 2004; extend the life of the aging space
shuttle fleet; complete design of a new orbital space plane; and continue
development of a new, reusable spacecraft and launch system to replace the
shuttle.



He said the amendment would not add to the proposed NASA 2003 budget of $15
billion, but would redirect some funds.



O'Keefe said his plan inserts a "systemic approach" into NASA's space
transportation activities, instead of having each element of space
transportation acting as a separate program.



"All of the elements have a relationship to each other," O'Keefe said.



Break down the costs

The budget amendment calls for spending:



 $1.6 billion to upgrade and improve the four-vehicle space shuttle fleet
so it could operate until about 2012. The plan leaves open an option of
extending shuttle usage into the 2020s.



 $15.2 billion over the next decade or so to add a fifth shuttle flight to
the annual schedule. The shuttle has been limited by budget constraints to
four flights a year and nearly all have been dedicated to assembly of the
space station. The added flight could be used to accelerate station assembly
or to perform other missions that are not now possible.



 $6.6 billion through 2006 to finish the basic assembly of the space
station. This includes completion and installation by February 19, 2004, of
Node 2, a U.S.-made cornerstone component to which European and Japanese
components will be attached. "Node 2 completion is a big deal for us," said
O'Keefe.



 $1.8 billion to support biological and physical research aboard the space
station.



 $2.4 billion to research and develop technologies needed to build a new
space system to replace the shuttle. This money would continue a long-range
effort to develop a reusable craft that could frequently fly into orbit with
less preparation and effort than is required for the space shuttle. O'Keefe
would not estimate the final cost of such a craft, but a chart released by
the agency suggested it would first fly in 2015.



 $2.4 billion to complete by 2004 the design of a new space plane that is
intended specifically to ferry people in and out of space. O'Keefe said the
design is still uncertain, but it would be a reusable spacecraft launched by
expendable rockets. It could carry as many as 10 people. The plan calls for
the craft to start operations sometime between 2008 and 2010.



Some members of Congress have complained that the space station crew size
has been limited to three, the maximum number that could crowd into the
Russian Soyuz, an evacuation craft attached to the station as a safety
measure. Since maintaining and operating the station requires almost the
full-time efforts of the three-member crew, some in Congress say little
science has been performed in the multibillion-dollar orbiting laboratory.
An independent space plane could allow more people to live on the station
and conduct more research.

A very outdated couple of designs, but at least they are suggesting shuttle 
replacement.

A more interesting article was that NASA contracted GE to test a demonstrator 
for a turbo jet based system (like the one used on the SR-71's) that go go up 
to mach 4.5.  GE hoped to be able to deliver a 15 to 1 thrust to weight ratin.

Now that would do a nice job in a first stage TSTO.

Small Steps Keep Us Grounded
The Spacefaring Web 2.19

by John Carter McKnight
Scottsdale - Nov 22, 2002

NASA's recent budget request is uninspiring, reactive and constraining - and
just what the doctor ordered. Agency Administrator Sean O'Keefe has
apparently realized that our grandiose dreams of near-term space triumphs
are simply shattered, leaving us - government, industry and advocacy alike -
with the unglamorous work of living within our means, delivering on our
promises, and slowly building a new space infrastructure, one that, this
time, can last.

There's an old saying that the best is the enemy of the good enough. NASA,
following in the family tradition of its older brother, the Pentagon, has
spent twenty years proving the maxim. President Reagan's little $8 billion
Space Station Freedom managed to misplace $5 billion last year, in its 18th
year of bureaucratic life.

Despite the "faster, better, cheaper" mantra, the engineering
bells-and-whistles mindset, coupled with government budgeting procedures,
has caused most projects to bloat.

The gap between expectations and results then gets filled with "viewgraph
engineering," more grandiose promises, coupled with requests for yet another
one-time-only emergency handout.

NASA and its dependent contractors are not alone in overpromising and
under-delivering. Space advocacy's track record is, if anything, worse ("L5
in '95," for example).

Volunteer enthusiasm couples with pent-up demand fed by NASA's failure to
deliver on its promises to create the same dynamic. Ambitious projects are
declared, discussed in a frenzy of chat-board activity - then, like so many
amateur rockets, either fizzle or explode.

Entrepreneurial space companies, often drawn from the ranks of either
advocates or frustrated veterans of NASA disappointments, have followed the
same pattern: the initial draft of the business plan (if they're that
realistic) calls for conquering the Solar System, producing two dozen
products and making billionaires of their first round investors, all in five
years.

To their credit, though, the entrepreneurs have been the first to learn the
lesson of "foundations first." The die-off of many of the launch vehicle
startups triggered an increase in professionalism and a decrease in
grandiosity among their successors.

Many current space startups have much more business savvy and vastly more
humble - and achievable - goals than their predecessors did. The lessons
they learned in the unforgiving school of the marketplace are finally
beginning to spread to their governmental and advocacy peers.

The space community had no monopoly on excess, to be sure. We've all been
down that road. Overpromising was what the latter 1990s were about.

While space has had its own dynamic, driven by NASA's pervasive lack of
realism, the entire Western economy was, if not, as the Texans say, "all hat
and no cattle," at least running with a hat/cattle ratio that no sober
banker (had there been any) would have approved.

That party's over. NASA must rebuild credibility with the public, with
Congress and with its international partners, deliver on promises already
made, and live within its budgetary means. Advocacy must do the same.

The NASA budget request is a courageous attempt to meet those critical
requirements of credibility, frugality and infrastructure repair. The Space
Launch Initiative was shaping up to generate a replacement for the Shuttle
as disastrously out of step with fiscal and mission requirements as the
original has been.

There is no good solution to the problems caused by unsafe, spectacularly
expensive and antiquated transportation to a largely worthless destination.
Sacking the SLI program while extending the life of the existing orbiters
and developing a relatively cheap lifeboat capable of supporting a full crew
complement on the International Space Station, is a good faith, "good
enough" fix.

Hopefully, this approach, grounded in a blessed lack of vision, will spread
through NASA's upper management. The agency's "NExT" initiative, despite
some very positive elements, smacks too much of a re-creation of the process
that diverted the bulk of its attention and resources into the Station and
Shuttle, to precious little relative return.

More microgravity mega-engineering does not seem a reasonable response
either to NASA's own priority of exploring life's origins, or to the public
and commercial demand for affordable access to space.

Criticism of this sort of bureaucratic "beau geste" has been coming from
interesting quarters. The Economist, the British news weekly, has long been
fanatically hostile to human spaceflight. Yet its November 14 editorial
marks a change in tone.

While still scathing ("It is true that science can be done in the space
station. But science can also be done dressed in a clown suit atop a large
Ferris wheel"), the editors go on to express sentiments that could have come
from this column:

[F]or decades there has been a huge pent-up demand for flights into space.
Although the private sector is finally making some progress towards this,
NASA should have been there years ago. What is still needed is research and
development on economical and safe space transport for the public at large.
Space, like the Wild West, can be truly opened up by the private sector.
NASA's central goal in human space flight should be to make that possible.

A broad consensus seems to be coalescing around this radical view. The
Commission on the Future of the United States Aerospace Industry delivered
its final report to the Administration this week. No visionary programs are
called for: rather, the focus is on rebuilding infrastructure, improving
basic research and removing trade barriers - the impediments to spacefaring
identified in the previous issue of this column.

The Commission calls for a realignment of Federal efforts around these
unglamorous but essential issues. The advocacy community as well should
follow suit, to aid in this effort and to redeem itself from the
overpromising/under-delivering space curse.

This past week marked the twentieth anniversary of a fringe organization
whose beginnings were much less promising than those of the space groups',
but whose influence, unlike that of our community, has become immense.

The Federalist Society began as a campus-based movement of conservative,
statist law students in an era when the top law schools were largely liberal
and biased against the exercise of imperial power. It was a fringe
organization regarded with deep suspicion by mainstream students and faculty
(as I recall from firsthand experience, having attended law school with
co-founders of the organization in its second year of existence).

Yet its anniversary was noted prominently in the New York Times - as the
commemorative celebration was attended by a Supreme Court Justice and the
Attorney General. No cabinet-level official has ever attended a
space-advocacy party, to the best of my knowledge.

What did the Federalist Society do right that the various space societies
have not? Three things of utterly critical significance: it focused on
training and promoting cadre, and on engaging in genuine, respectful debate
with its opponents. Also, it did not squander its energy on
personality-driven factional infighting or schismatic doctrinal squabbles.
The space advocacy organizations should learn that lesson and radically
revision themselves around those two positive projects.

The Federalist Society made the front pages because it spent twenty years
recruiting bright students who were receptive to its message, training and
indoctrinating them, and networking them with alumni and supporters in
positions of influence. In less than a generation their strategy has given
them policy dominance over the Federal agency of concern to them, the
Justice Department.

Imagine if a space organization could have placed its members throughout the
NASA hierarchy, claiming the Administrator and the Secretary of Defense as
allies - we might actually have a Federal space effort accomplishing
something other than intellectual and financial bankruptcy restructuring.

The other critical technique involves recruiting one's adversaries as
marketing representatives. By providing a forum for liberal and libertarian
opponents to hone their arguments through debate, the Federalist Society
forced those opponents to accord it respect and legitimacy.

By putting their people on panels alongside respected mainstream opinion
leaders, they declared themselves peers and serious players. When their
opponents would go out marketing themselves, they would likely refer to
having assailed their Federalist Society adversaries - again, marking the
once-fringe organization as a legitimate peer of the prominent mainstream
figure.

Space advocacy groups have consistently chosen to preach to the choir rather
than to engage their critics. This choice ghettoizes us, prevents us from
becoming truly proficient or convincing in delivering our message, denies us
the opportunity to win over moderates who have only heard the opposition's
case, and denies us the leverage of putting our adversaries to work
marketing us.

There has been talk of engaging the environmental and religious communities,
of opening a dialog with the technologically-skeptical "Party of Nah," but
little concrete action. Our failure costs us influence.

NASA now has an opportunity to rebuild its financial, reputational and
physical infrastructure. Only when this process is complete will it be able
to move on to grander things.

By abandoning the impulse to build deep-space Egyptian pyramids in favor of
more mundane and infinitely more useful Roman roads, the agency may actually
accomplish its true goal of opening the space frontier. If the space
advocacy groups similarly choose to abandon millennial fervor and
narcissistic self-destruction in favor of recruiting, training and
influence-building, they can provide the leadership of government and
industry necessary for opening that frontier.

Critical to both efforts is accepting that, for now, building a spacefaring
civilization does not involve grand theorizing, viewgraph engineering or
marching gaily off to triumph. For now, revolutionary patience lies in
inspiring the kids, paying the bills and building the roads. If we do those
things right, the triumphs will surely come.

Gentlemen,
I hadn't heard the term "viewgraph engineering" before, and I'm wondering, could this be like a computer simulation of something that doesn't exist (yet, anyway)?
Enlighten, please.
Keep looking up,

I think its engineering concepts to the point of cool looking slide

               A Rocket a Day Keeps the High Costs Away

               ========================================



                            by John Walker

                          September 27, 1993



There's a pretty general consensus that one of the greatest barriers

to the exploration and development of space is the cost of launch to

low earth orbit.  The incessant and acrimonious arguments among

partisans of the Shuttle, DC-*, NASP, TSTO, Big Dumb Boosters,

bringing back the Saturn V, buying launches from the Russians and/or

Chinese, or of developing exotic launch technologies (laser,

electromagnetic, skyhook, etc.) conceal the common premise of all

those who argue--that if we could launch payloads for a fraction of

today's cost, perhaps at a tenth to a thousandth of today's rates of

thousands of US$ per kilogram, then the frontier would open as the

great railway to orbit supplanted the first generation wagon trains.

The dispute is merely over which launch technology best achieves this

goal.



Conventional wisdom as to why industry and government choose not to

invest in this or that promising launch technology is that there

aren't enough payloads to generate the volume to recoup the

development cost and, in all likelihood, there never will be.



How much would it cost to find out if this is true?



What we pay today

-----------------



Could we take a moment's pause from debating which is the best

successor to the outrageously expensive way we launch now and, as

engineers, ask ourselves just why it is that rockets have to cost tens

or hundreds of million of US$ per shot.  Space FAQ space/launchers

gives approximate per-launch costs of representative systems on which

commercial launches can be purchased as:



    Vehicle         Mission cost, US$ millions

    -------         --------------------------

    Scout G1                    12

    Pegasus                     13.5

    Soyuz                       15

    Long March 3                33

    Titan II                    43

    Delta                    45 -  50

    Proton                   35 -  70

    Zenit                       65

    Atlas                    45 -  85

    Ariane 4                 65 - 115

    Energia                    110

    H-2                        110

    Titan III                  158

    Titan IV                315 - 360



I've deliberately not included data on performance, reliability, or

anything else because that would distract us from the most striking

observation about these vehicles; each and every one of them, whatever

the technology, country of origin, original design intent, launch

history, fuel and oxidiser, success or failure in the commercial

launch market, have mission costs in ranging from tens to hundreds of

millions of US$.



Why is this?  Why do rockets cost so much?



What's in a launcher?

---------------------



Let's simplify the problem by focusing entirely on expendable boosters

built with current technologies--those used in the existing launchers

named above.  Further, let's consider only pure liquid-fueled

launchers (with the exception of Scout and Pegasus, the core stages of

each of the above launchers are liquid rockets).  From an engineering

standpoint, then, what is a rocket?



Well, it consists of a collection, often vertically stacked, of:



    Cylindrical fuel and oxidiser tanks

    Rocket engines (including turbopumps, gas generators, etc.)

    Guidance mechanisms (gimbal joints, hydraulic actuators, APUs)

    Guidance and navigation system (IMU, GPS, radio command receiver)



plus other ancillary details like range safety receivers and telemetry

sensors and transmitters and the like, and that's about it, isn't it?



Now the question that comes to mind is this: why should something like

that cost tens to hundreds of millions of US$?



Cylindrical fuel tanks aren't that expensive, and they make up most of

the rocket.  (Sure, if you're striving for every last gram of

throw-weight in an ICBM, you can push the tankage cost as high as you

like, but in a commercial launcher?)  And rocket engines are finicky,

complicated, and intolerant of defects.  Well, yes...but so is a DOHC

4 valve per cylinder turbocharged, intercooled V-8 internal combustion

engine, and nonetheless one can purchase such an engine, integrated

into a ground transportation vehicle, from a number of manufacturers

at a cost three orders of magnitude less than that charged for the

rocket, and expect it to function without catastrophic failures or

extensive maintenance, for five years, tens of thousands of

kilometers, and thousands of mission cycles.  Guidance?  Again, as

long as we aren't gram-shaving, this is pretty mundane stuff--the

hydraulics can mostly be adapted from airliners, and the electronics

from a PC--"mem'ry for nothin', chips for free".  (For an LEO launcher

we don't need radiation-hardened electronics.)



The first mass-produced launcher

--------------------------------



We've seen from the "standing army" argument for launchers requiring

minimal (airline-scale) ground mission support the impact of fixed

costs on per-mission costs when the number of missions is limited.

But the presence or absence of a "standing army", and the frequency of

flights over which fixed costs are spread, isn't fundamentally linked

to whether the launcher is reusable or expendable.  Consider the

following mass-produced expendable rocket.



    Number manufactured:        6,240



    Number launched:            3,590

        Successes:                        2,890  (81%)

        Failures:                           700  (19%)

    In inventory:               2,100

    Work in progress:             250

    Expended in development:      300



    Development program cost:               US$ 2 billion

    Development cost per launcher:          US$ 350,512

    Total manufacturing cost per launcher:  US$  43,750

    Marginal cost, launchers 5000+:         US$  13,000  (Yes, 13K!)



These are actual figures for the first mass-produced rocket vehicle,

the V2 (A4)--fifty years ago.  Prices are in US wartime dollars.



Stating the obvious....  The V2 was a suborbital vehicle, intended to

lob high explosive over relatively short distances.  Quantity

production of the V2 at Mittelwerk was accomplished with unpaid slave

labour under the brutal rule of the SS.  And the failure rate was

unacceptable by current standards.



And yet...consider that this was the very first space-capable rocket

ever built.  That it was manufactured under the constraints of a war

that Germany was losing, subject to aerial bombardment by night and by

day, with continual supply shortages.  That, as a consequence of Nazi

slave-labour, the desperate war situation, and the state of current

technology, no significant automation was applied to its manufacture.

In February 1945 the underground Mittelwerk V2 factory delivered 800

ready-to-launch V2s; after the war U.S. intelligence expert T. P.

Wright estimated that at full production, unconstrained by wartime

shortages, the Mittelwerk plant could have produced 900 to 1000 V2s

per month.



One thousand rockets per month...fifty years ago.  Think about that.



A Rocket a Day

--------------



Suppose we translate these figures, almost incomprehensible by modern

standards (*three hundred* launch vehicles expended in the development

program!) into quasi-modern terms.  Consider an orbital launch vehicle

two-stage, say, clean and green thanks to LH2/LOX propulsion in all

stages.  Engines: J2 or RL10s or follow-on uprated versions (we'll

have plenty of opportunity to develop them and phase them in).  A

simple two stage cylindrical stack like Titan II, with GPS or

ground-commanded navigation.  Payload interface is a big ring with

bolt-holes and a standard fairing with plenty of volume inside.



Sounds a lot like NLS/SpaceLifter, doesn't it?  STMEs may have

marginal advantages over sea-level-optimised derivatives of RL10 or

J2, but otherwise what's the difference?



What if we launch one every day?



Three hundred and sixty-five a year.



That would be less than one twenty-fifth the production rate of the V2

under concentrated Allied bombardment in 1945.



How much would each one cost?



Assume we expense the development cost or amortise it over a

sufficiently large number of vehicles that it can be ignored.

Further, assume that our bigger, more complicated (two-stage), and

higher tech (LH2/LOX instead of Ethanol/LOX), launcher costs ten times

as much as the V2, and that 1945 wartime dollars convert into current

dollars at 10 to 1.  Then, starting with the US$13,000 marginal cost

of a V2, we arrive at a cost of US$1.3 million per launch vehicle.  If

we launch one a day our total vehicle budget will be US$475 million

per year--comparable to a single shuttle flight (no, I don't want to

re-open *that* debate again; let's just say it's the same order of

magnitude, OK?).  If our mass produced LH2/LOX launcher equals the

performance of the Delta 6925 by placing 3900 kg in LEO, the cost to

LEO is US$333/kg; if we achieve better throw-weight, this figure goes

down accordingly.  If we build the thing so cheap, dumb, and heavy

that its payload is only 1000 kg--one metric ton--the cost rises to

US$1300/kg, which is still a factor of ten lower than the comparable

cost to LEO for Ariane, Atlas, Delta, and Titan.



Logistics and Ground Support

----------------------------



Okay, you say, suppose mass production in these absurd quantities

could actually drive the hardware cost down to less than a million and

half per bird, we still haven't accounted for the standing army that

launch operations require.  If it takes thousands or tens of thousands

of people to launch tens of vehicles per year, won't it take hundreds

of thousands to launch one every day?



Well, why should it?  Again consider the V2.  In the two weeks from

September 18-30 1944, a total of 127 V2s were launched from five

different launch sites.  That's an average of almost ten a day.  This

was accomplished by two mobile groups totaling about 6,300 men and

1600 vehicles, forced to relocate frequently due to the Allied

advance, and subjected to frequent aerial bombardment.  It was

estimated that, given adequate supply, one hundred V2s could be

launched per day in a "maximum effort" by the mobile units, and that a

rate of half that, 350 per week, was sustainable.



Parkinson's law notwithstanding, why, after fifty years of

technological progress and experience in launch operations, should it

take tens of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars

to achieve a launch rate one fiftieth that of a V2 group launching the

very first operational ballistic missile from a launch site with tanks

and infantry advancing toward it and airplanes flying over dropping

bombs on them?



Yes, LH2 is trickier to handle; a multistage rocket requires a more

complicated launch and service facility, and so on.  But if we design

up-front for a sustained launch rate of one per day, can we not find

ways around these problems?  Perhaps a mobile transporter / erector /

launcher like SS24 or Pershing II, with fuel and oxidiser delivered by

underground pipes that attach to the launch truck.  Or something....

Let's tell the engineers to go figure it out and see if they come up

with something that works.



It can't be impossible; the Soviet R-7 series launchers (Vostok /

Voskhod / Soyuz) almost furnish an existence proof.  These launchers,

despite their mechanical complexity (4 liquid boosters and 20 first

stage engines), are typically launched one to two days after

horizontal delivery to the pad.  On several occasions beginning in

1962, two manned launches were made from the same pad less than 24

hours apart.  On October 11-13 1969, three manned missions (Soyuz 6,

7, and 8) were launched from the same pad within 48 hours.



If we use contemporary sensors and computers to automate the fueling

and checkout, why does the "launch team" need to be huge?  Bob drives

the launcher out to the middle of the circle of concrete, hooks up the

hoses, then goes back to the blockhouse and presses the green "Start"

button.  An hour later, or so, the "Ready" light comes on, and at High

Noon he pushes the red "Go" button.  Sitting immediately to his right

Fred, in the blue suit, follows the proceedings on a laptop computer

with his index finger on the orange "Oops" button.



Assuming things go OK, ten minutes after the ship lifts, Bob goes out

and drives the launch truck back to the garage where it's reloaded

with the next rocket (assume we have ten trucks, or so, to pipeline

the setup process and account for attrition).  Then it's off the

cafeteria for lunch.



Excess Capacity

---------------



Every proposal, prosaic or exotic, for a high-capacity,

fast-turnaround launch system immediately runs into the objection,

"There just aren't enough payloads to make the system pay.  Other than

a few established markets for satellites, there just aren't that many

profitable, useful, or interesting things to do in space right now,

and we already have too many launchers chasing too few launch

customers."



This is the heart of the chicken-and-egg problem that is blocking the

development and exploration of space.



As long as launches cost tens or hundreds of millions of US$ each,

only governments and the very largest corporations will be able to

afford them, and only for the most obvious and essential purposes,

such as communication, earth resource, navigation, and reconnaissance

satellites.  And as long as the number of such payloads is less than a

hundred per year, who is realistically going to pay to develop a

launcher capable of sustained rates many times as great, however cheap

it ends up being?  You'd just end up with a huge pile of rockets

gathering dust waiting for payloads, wouldn't you?



Would you?



Consider the following scenario.  The Agency announces a procurement

in which bidders are invited to provide launches, one per day, of 2000

kg or more to a standard Low Earth Orbit, mating with a specified

payload and shroud interface and to a prescribed set of services on a

flat concrete pad.  A suitably derated payload is specified for polar

orbit.  Bids of more than US$1.25 million per successful launch will

be returned unread.  The winner of the bid will be awarded a

fixed-price contract for 1000 launches at the agreed price.  The first

100 launches will be considered development flights and will be

purchased at the bid price regardless of success or failure; afterward

only successful launches will be purchased.  The procurement will be

re-competed every 1000 launches; if a new vendor wins with a

substantially lower cost per launch, they will be granted the same

development period for the first 100 flights.  The vendor retains all

rights to the launcher design and is free to offer it on the open

market independent of the Agency.



Immediately the launch contract awarded, the Agency announces the

availability of daily flights of 2000 kg to LEO or 1500 kg to polar

orbit.  Commercial enterprises may purchase launches for whatever

purpose they wish at a price equal to the Agency's cost per launch

plus 25%.  Unsold flights are offered on a first-come, first-served

basis to researchers, government agencies, and individuals.  In the

event of excess demand, non-commercial proposals will be selected by a

peer review process similar to that used to allocate telescope time at

astronomical observatories.  All risks of launch failure are borne by

the provider of the payload; clients should note historical failure

rates and build appropriate spares.  Provider of the payload assumes

all liability for it once it separates from Agency's rocket.  Payloads

shall be delivered by truck to the loading dock of the Agency's Rocket

Garage.  All payloads must be supplied with adequate documentation to

verify their content and safety.  The payload interface specification

handbook is available for US$5 from the Agency's toll-free order line;

payload test and integration jigs are available in the Agency's

regional centres and many major universities around the world.  Plans

for building your own are available for US$5.



Payloads delivered to the Rocket Garage are inspected to ensure they

are not nuclear bombs, sacks of gravel, or otherwise unacceptable.

Payloads containing propulsion hardware are reviewed especially

closely.  Assuming no big no-nos, the payload is bolted to the top of

the next free rocket, the requested orbit inclination is dialed into

the rocket's guidance system, and it moves down the queue toward the

pad.



The adventurous will recall that the Project Mercury capsule had a

launch weight of 1935 kg.



If fewer than one payload a day arrives at the Rocket Garage (as is

certain at the outset), the Agency will store the excess rockets in

the Rocket Warehouse out back, while continuing to launch at least one

per week with an inert concrete payload (in a rapidly decaying orbit)

to maintain launch team proficiency and verify the continuing quality

of rockets supplied by the vendor.



This procurement and offering of launch services is explicitly

intended to punch through the chicken-and-egg problem.  In essence,

the Agency would be spending US$475 million a year on a flock of 365

hens, then waiting to see if eggs started to show up.  This runs the

risk, of course, of ending up with egg all over one's face.



Suppose it isn't possible to build a rocket that will orbit half the

payload of a Delta, launched 50 times less frequently than the V2, at

a cost ten times greater than that primitive fifty year old missile.

In that case nobody responds seriously to the Agency's bid, and the

Agency goes and blows the money on something else, vowing to try again

in ten years.



Now suppose the rockets do start showing up one a day, and departing

on schedule with a success rate that makes the supplier's profit

margin juicy enough to fund further R&D, but the payloads don't

appear.  The Agency rapidly becomes the butt of every stand-up comic

and a motion is introduced in the Legislature to re-name it the

"Orbital Ready-Mix Delivery Agency".  Well, if that's how it plays

out, I guess we all ought to pack up and go home then, shouldn't we?

Because that would demonstrate, in a real-world test, than there

really aren't very many useful things to do in space, after all.  That

even if we push the marginal cost of launches down to zero, nobody

will be able to think of anything to use them for, not for Venus probe

science fair projects, personal spysats, hypersonic surfing

demonstration/validation flights, nor microgravity research, material

processing, life sciences, remote sensing, VLBI radio astronomy,

optical astronomy, or anything else.  That other than the existing

big-market space applications, there's no earthly reason to leave the

Earth, that much of the "space age" was based on faulty premises, that

the "final frontier" isn't worth exploring.



Is this likely to be the case?



Loose Ends

----------



Naturally, things aren't as easy to accomplish in the real world as

they are to bandy about on paper.  Special relativity limits the

velocity with which one can wave one's arms, and the UNDO button

doesn't remove a hole you've just bored the wrong place into an

expensive piece of metal.  Many things might go wrong in an attempt to

jump-start the exploitation of space this way.  The two real biggies

are discussed above: "it won't work", or "space isn't worth it".  Here

are some others I'm concerned about as well.



Range Capacity.  Given current low launch rates, configuring a range

is complicated and takes a long time which couldn't accommodate daily

launches, especially to a variety of inclinations.  And most existing

spaceports can't handle both equatorial and polar launches.  Maybe we

should plan on Hawaii or Cape York from the outset and get the

paperwork started to declare an appropriate air and sea exclusion zone

(for two hours per day around the scheduled launch time).  Any rocket

that meets the launch rate and cost criteria cannot require complex or

expensive ground infrastructure.



Environmental Issues.  One reason for insisting on LH2/LOX rather than

Kerosene/LOX, hypergolics, or solids/hybrids is that it's clean.  We

could launch one every minute and contribute less to global warming,

ozone layer depletion, and other varieties of atmospheric pollution

than 747s crossing the Atlantic every day.  Also, exhaust and/or

fluffy white clouds resulting from the occasional really bad day

aren't harmful to anybody who happens to be downwind.  On the solid

waste issue, clearly dropping big chunks of aluminum and steel into

the ocean every day isn't a particularly elegant way to break the

bonds of gravity, not compared to all those sleek paper spaceplanes on

the magazine covers.  But I suspect if one were to compare the total

mass wasted in expended stages to that of non-recycled aluminum cans

and automobile engines, it would be an insignificant percentage.  It's

worth noting that what we're throwing away every day consists

basically of aluminum and iron with a dash of silicon, and that these

are three of the four most abundant elements in the Earth's crust.

Besides, outside the two-hour launch period, salvage boats are welcome

to recover the expended stages and sell them for scrap.



Space Junk.  So many launches may run the risk of unacceptably

polluting the near-Earth environment.  Clearly, as noted above, care

will be required not to launch payloads likely to explode or otherwise

misbehave in orbit.  Payloads will probably have to be released in

orbits which guarantee the timely decay and burn-up of expended upper

stages.  We need to make sure the upper stage always burns up

completely, leaving no chunks to go "thump" in the night.  Payloads

intended for high-traffic or high-risk final orbits will require

special certification that they will dispose of themselves in a

responsible manner.



Fuel cost.  It may be that if we succeed in pushing the hardware cost

down, we'll end up with an airline-like situation where fuel cost

becomes a major component of the expense.  I don't know how much

liquid hydrogen goes for today, and I haven't tried to predict what

it would cost when purchased in the quantities a launch a day would

require.  This needs to be worked out.  Even daily launches should be

a minor consumer in the market for liquid oxygen.



Payload pyrotechnic servicing.  In the discussion of payload delivery

and integration, I confess to glossing over the issue of pre-launch

payload servicing.  You can't just take a satellite with a solid kick

motor and a hundred kilograms of hydrazine on board down to the DHL

counter and ship it to the spaceport.  The hazardous aspects of

payload processing must be done in a thoroughly professional manner at

a facility close to the launch site, and the design of these aspects

of payloads must be subjected to design reviews comparable to those

currently used for commercial launches.  This increases the payload

cost, but not the launch cost.  It will probably promote the emergence

of standard spacecraft buses which provide these components of the

payload, which can be serviced for launch for a flat fee by their

vendors.



Tracking and control.  The daily launch rate envisioned here would

overwhelm existing ground control facilities.  Yet the experience of

AMSAT and UOSAT proves that sophisticated and expensive gear isn't

required to manage a satellite, at least in LEO. Without access to

TDRSS or a global tracking network, most satellites are going to have

be very autonomous, communicating with their makers in occasional

high-bandwidth gabfests as they pop above the horizon.  Since it's

very likely that one or more manufacturers will offer a standard

satellite bus compatible with the launcher, providing power,

communications, etc., perhaps they will also market access to an

uplink and downlink as a value-added service.  From your nearest ISDN

jack or Internet site, you could send and receive packets to your

satellite and let the bus vendor worry about how and when they were

delivered.  Deep space missions are a problem; those who propose them

are going to have to obtain time on a big dish as part of their grant

proposal.  One hopes that if many missions with clear scientific merit

are proposed, money might be forthcoming to expand the existing deep

space communication facilities.



NASA/Congress will never do it.  Who said anything about NASA or the

U.S. Congress?  A total budget of US$475 million per year is within

the reach of many industrialised nations, especially at a time when

defence spending is being curtailed, aerospace companies are suffering

from excess capacity, engineering and manufacturing people are

suffering lay-offs, and policy makers worry about how to convert

defence industries without harming readiness by eroding the industrial

base.  US$475 million per year represents the following percentage of

the early 1990's defence budgets (CIA World Factbook 1992) of the

following countries:



    Country        % Defence Budget

    ---------      ----------------

    South Africa       13.6%

    Switzerland        10.3%

    Sweden              7.7%

    Australia           6.3%

    Israel              6.3%

    Spain               5.5%

    China               4.0% (approx)

    Italy               2.1%

    France              1.4%

    Japan               1.3%

    Germany             1.2%

    United Kingdom      1.1%

    United States       0.15%



Any country whose government became convinced that a scheme like this

might give it a long-term (literal) leg up in the world and beyond,

eventually, could implement it by reprogramming a small percentage of

its existing military spending, much of which would flow right back

into its own industries and economy and might be seen to have military

value it its own right.  For that matter, US$475 million is just about

what Microsoft will spend on R&D in fiscal year 1993 and a third of

their pre-tax profit, and it's less than 3% of Motorola's sales for

the same year, so well-heeled and forward-looking companies (or

consortium of such) could play as well.



Conclusion

----------



The near-term development of space is constrained by excessive costs

of launching payloads to low Earth orbit.  The development of

innovative launch technologies is discouraged by an apparent over

capacity of existing launchers, "where will the payloads come from?",

while development of payloads for new space applications isn't

affordable given current launch costs.



Rocketry was originally developed as a branch of artillery.

Proponents of various reusable launch technologies argue that as long

as an artillery-like model is maintained, affordable launches will

never be possible.  But to be effective, artillery must not only have

adequate throw-weight, it must also provide a rapid rate of fire while

minimising the cost of expended rounds.  Today's space launch

"artillery" costs tens to hundreds of millions of US$ per shot and

fires at intervals measured in weeks or months.  Yes, expendable

launchers are artillery, and the ones we have today are, as artillery

pieces, extremely overpriced and under-performing.



The last time liquid rockets were truly treated as artillery was the

very first time they were used in war, the A4/V2, fifty years ago.

Despite an increasingly desperate war situation, constant supply

problems, and aerial bombardment, V2s were manufactured at rates of up

to 800 per month, launched at a comparable pace, and produced at a

marginal cost of US$13,000 (1945 dollars) for each additional rocket

after the first 5000.



Making allowances for all the differences between Nazi Germany and the

modern world, between a not very militarily useful nor reliable weapon

and a viable space launcher, between a one-stage Ethanol/LOX missile

and a multistage LH2/LOX launcher, between 1945 wartime dollars and

current currency, still one must ask why, after 50 years of

technological progress and rocket experience, our current rockets cost

not five, not ten, not twenty times as much as a V2, but between one

hundred (Pegasus) and two thousand four hundred (Titan III/SRM) times

as much.  Is what a Delta 6925 does, lobbing 3900 kg into LEO,

fundamentally three hundred times more expensive than what a V2 did

fifty years ago?



It is interesting to observe that current launchers are bought and

launched in quantities about a thousand times less than those of the

V2 at peak production.  In no sense are they mass-produced, and

therefore they do not benefit from either the means of mass production

(investment in highly-automated manufacturing), nor from the learning

curve that results when one builds hundreds and thousands of an

identical product.  Could it be that a large component of the present

unacceptably high launch cost is both cause and effect of the present

low rate of launches?
