=93The Small-World Phenomenon: An Algorithmic Perpective=94
In his paper, Kleinburg defines a generalization of the Watts-Strogate=20
model (a model that encompasses the small world phenomenon.  Start with a=20
set of lattice points in an nxn square.  Add a directed edge from a node u
-       to every other node within lattice distance k (short-range=20
contacts) and
-       to q other nodes v with a probability proportional to 1/(x^r) where=
=20
x is the lattice distance from u to v (long-range contacts).
When r =3D 0, then the long range contacts are uniformly distributed as in=
=20
the Watt-Strogate model.  As the value of r increases, the long-range=20
contacts become more clustered around node u and thus more structurally=20
organized and less useful.
It is proven there is exactly one class within this infinite family of=20
models that displays property (2) - when r=3D2 and k=3Dq=3D1.  For this=
 class of=20
models, the expected length of a path returned by a decentralized algorithm=
=20
is at most c2(log n)2 where c2 is a constant dependent on the values of r,=
=20
k, and q but independent of n.  Let Aj be the set of nodes whose lattice=20
distance from node t is between 2j and 2j+1.  The exponent r=3D2 is the only=
=20
exponent at which all nodes other than node t are uniformly distributed=20
over the sets A0, A1, =85., Alog n.  Suppose we want to construct a path=
 from=20
node s to node t.  Let the current message holder be denoted as node u.  An=
=20
algorithm is in phase j if node u is in set Aj.  The time it takes to break=
=20
out of any given phase is bounded proportionally to log(n).  There are at=20
most 1 + log(n) phases, hence the (log n)^2 bound.

=93P2P and the Small World Phenomenon=94
This paper does a case study on Freenet and Gnutella.  The small-world=20
effect is fundamental in Freenet=92s scalability, fault-tolerance, and=20
performance.  The majority of nodes in a small network model have only a=20
few local connections to other nodes and only a few nodes are well=20
connected with large-range contacts.  Freenet=92s scalability and=
 performance=20
is attributed to the shortcuts provides by these few well-connected=20
nodes.  One characteristic of a small-world network is the existence of a=20
scale-free power-law distribution of links within the network.  This=20
power-law distribution is the reason for Freenet=92s high level of=20
fault-tolerance.  Random failure will most likely take out a=20
poorly-connected node since they are the majority of nodes in the=20
network.  The effect of failure for a poorly-connected node is minimal in=20
the overall network routing.   The performance of routing is noticeably=20
affected only with the failure of highly-connected nodes.  Freenet handles=
=20
free-loaders by ignoring them.  Gnutella does not depend on the small-word=
=20
effect and instead broadcasts its queries.  Due to this characteristic,=20
Gnutella is not very scalable.  In face of attacks, Gnutella performs worse=
=20
than Freenet under random attacks but removing the most-connected nodes in=
=20
Gnutella is not as severe as in Freenet.  This is due to the fact that the=
=20
nodes in Gnutella are considered roughly equivalent.  Gnutella is=20
vulnerable to free-riding due to its lack of state about its=20
peers.  Free-riding results in higher latency or even worse failed queries.

=93A Measurement Study of Peer-to-Peer Systems=94
A measurement study is performed on Napster and Gnutella in the paper=20
titled where the focus is on characterizing the end-user host in this=20
system based on their latency, lifetime, bottleneck and bandwidth.  The=20
above analysis is based on several crawls of both systems and snapshots of=
=20
the users over a span of several days.  Most of the current protocols of=20
P2P systems uniformly delegate responsibility to all nodes within the=20
system.  It has been observed that roughly one third of the peers in=20
Gnutella are unsuitable to act as servers due to their bandwidth=20
capabilities.   High latency is a problem in Gnutella since connections are=
=20
formed in an unstructured manner, despite the face that latency amoung=20
communicating peers vary.  Protocols also tend to assume the=20
cooperativeness of the peers and assume peers behave equally in terms of=20
downloads and uploads.  A discrepancy in the upstream and downstream=20
bandwidth of Gnutella exists. The download capacity of the system is higher=
=20
than its upload capacity.  Napster has a better download capacity than that=
=20
of Gnutella.  Overall the majority of both systems are uncooperative and=20
free-riding is a major issue.  The characteristics of both systems=20
represent that of a client-server model.

In general, unstructured P2P systems do not behave as well as structured=20
P2P systems.  As proven in Klienburg=92s paper, some structure is needed for=
=20
more informed and thus more efficient routing.  Freenet, though also an=20
unstructured system, is somewhat more =91organized=92 than that of Gnutella=
=20
since it is depended on its topology being that of a small world.  Its less=
=20
unstructured topology results in better scalability and=20
performance.  Design constraints are mentioned under =93A Measurement Study=
=20
of Peer-to-Peer System=94.
