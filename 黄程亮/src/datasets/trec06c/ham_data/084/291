Greetings,

Node 8 looks like it may have lost it's boot order configuration, and is
trying the HD before PXE. The Tyan BIOS frequently tries to boot the MBR
blindly (leaving the serial screen scrape ISR in place) resulting in a
hang.

The BIOS can be reset through minicom (hit reset on node, then hit F2 on
minicom. In the boot order menu, the UNDI should be above hard drvie.

The other node's boot issue likely is a transient net condition. This sort
of thing is fairly common in booting since all nodes demand the master at
once and even w/ gig on the master, max out it's bandwidth 5 times over.

I found the sec. master running. Just in case, I re-made it's swap space
and rebooted it. It is up now.

On the master, it sounds like the LED is actually the problem. The LEDs
refer to the internal case fans. Those fans are also connected to a beeper
that will emit a piercing alarm if any fan's RPM goes too low.

Really, the LEDs on those cases are a sort of one size fits all thing. One
might expect the T leds to refer to temperature, but really they just
indicate that they have power in this case. 

Just to be sure, I checked CPU temp and fan RPM on the nodes, and they
show normal (in /proc/sys/dev/sensors/w83782d-i2c-0-2d )

I will have a look at the remaining library issues.

G'day,
sjames
