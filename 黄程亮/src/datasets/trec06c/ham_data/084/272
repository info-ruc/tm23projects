The small-world phenomenon: An algorithmic perspective

This paper examines decentralized algorithms by which 
nodes, knowing only the locations of their direct 
acquaintances, attempt to transmit a message from a 
source to a destination along a short path.   The 
authors prove that in a class of networks generate 
according to the Watts-Strogatz model, there is no 
decentralized algorithm capable of constructing paths 
of small, expected length.  They define an infinite 
family of random network models that generalizes the 
Watts-Strogatz model and demonstrate that there is a 
decentralized algorithm that is able to find short 
paths with high probability.  They also prove that 
there is a unique model within this family for which 
decentralized algorithms are effective.   The proofs 
demonstrate that the small-world phenomenon makes it 
possible for unstructured P2P systems to perform, at 
least, as well as more structured ones if the system 
has a uniform distribution of links.  

P2P and the small world phenomena

This chapter focuses on decentralized peer-to-peer 
systems and applies some of the concepts of the small-
world model to Freenet and Gnutella. 

Freenet:  Queries are forwarded one peer to the next, 
till any peer owning a copy of a file can reply.  In 
order to make Freenet a small world, the Freenet graph 
needs to be connected and short routes must exist 
between any two arbitrary peers; both properties are 
shown satisfied.  It translates into good average 
performance and poor worst-case performance, good 
scalability and fault tolerance.
Gnutella: Queries are conducted via broadcast – this 
does not invoke the small world effect.  In order to 
increase Gnutella’s effieciency, a partly hierarchical 
model using super peers is proposed to reduce the 
effective size of the network.

The effort required to do a search in an unstructured 
system grows logarithmically with respect to the search 
space.


A Measurement Study of Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Systems

The authors propose that the characteristics 
(bandwidth, latency, etc) of participating nodes in a 
P2P system need to be considered in system 
evaluations.  These characteristics include bandwidth, 
latency, availability, degree of sharing, among others, 
at each node.  They perform measurements on Napster and 
Gnutella and find that peers in these systems are 
significantly heterogeneous and peers don’t always tell 
the truth.  They find that a significant proportion of 
peers are just ‘free-riders’.  The authors suggest an 
attempt be made to directly measure the characteristics 
of peers to build more robust systems.

The design constraints involve identifying the ‘free-
riders’ and giving them less priority.  Also generous 
participants with low bandwidths need to be identified 
somehow (because they might not admit they have 
problems) in order not to overload them and 
subsequently slow down the whole network.
