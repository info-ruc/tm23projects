O.K. So Thursday morning is canceled. 
BTW, how we are going to backup the old installation. 
Do we have a tape device attached to the cluster?

hi sasko,

   i think we should go ahead with it. this means we will NOT recompile
the
kernel on thursday as originally planned. you can go ahead and prepare
for 
the RH7.2 installation. i will contact linux labs and tell them we are
going
ahead with the upgrade and find out more about the schedule.
