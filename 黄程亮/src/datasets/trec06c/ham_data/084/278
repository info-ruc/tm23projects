The Small-World Phenomenon (applied to networks) was 
introduced in the first paper.  The main contributions 
of this paper was to identify what the small-world 
phenomenon is and classify how some networks can fit 
into this category.  It identifies that networks with 
nodes that have long range contact have a high 
probability of having a path that can be bounded by log 
n (ie. 6 degrees of separation).  However, in peer-to-
peer networks, we want these paths to be found with 
only local information.  They prove that if long range 
contacts are randomly distributed, these paths are 
virtually impossible to find, however, if these 
contacts are not random, nodes will be able to find 
them only with local information (ie. with a 
decentralised algorithm).

So in general, unstructured P2P systems that fit 
the “small-world Phenomenon” can perform just as well 
as structured networks if not better.  This was shown 
in the second paper when the performance of Freenet was 
analysed.  Through simulation, if they just randomly 
picked a link, a file took up to 50 hops to be found, 
however, with Freenet with its local information, the 
average could be found with an average number of hops 
of 5 hops or fewer.  Gnutella was also analysed.  The 
model used for Gnutella simulation was random model 
(which is not supported by the last paper which state 
that connections to server like nodes are preferred), a 
non-small-world model.   Because of the randomness in 
Gnutella, this paper states that Gnutella is less 
susceptible to attacks on highly connected nodes (again 
contradictory to the last paper).   Tradeoffs in 
performance were identified in this paper.  Randomness 
of Gnutella trades efficiency for better worst case 
scenarios, where as Freenet trades worse-case 
performance for scalability and search efficiency.

In the last paper, the end-users of p2p systems 
(Napster and Gnutella) where analysed.  Up to this 
point, no evaluation has taken into account user 
characteristics.  The paper identified that these 
systems are indeed heterogeneous.  Many users are free-
loaders and misreport their connections.  With regards 
to lifetime, most nodes are not up more than 60 minutes 
per session.  The upshot of this paper is that future 
designs should take into account the different 
characteristics including many nodes having low 
bandwidth, high latency, minimal participation and 
misreported information.  In particular, there should 
be incentive for users to co-operate.
