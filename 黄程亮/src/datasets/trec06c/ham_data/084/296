EE faculty,

First, I believe that all the EE faculty are aware of the very high 
importance of ABET accreditation.  The advantages of accreditation 
are numerous and I continue to find out ones that I was previously 
unaware of.  For example,  there can  be no Tau Beta Pi chapter at 
UCSC until we have two accredited programs -- we currently have only 
CE accredited.  EE has fallen seriously behind the schedule for ABET 
preparation, posted on the ABET website 
(www.soe.ucsc.edu/~larrabee/abet/).

As you know, the resignation of Jiayuan Fang and Don Wiberg's surgery 
have severely impacted our ABET preparation efforts.   We now have 
only 5 senior and two junior faculty available at present with Peyman 
returning from sabbatical in January.  Jiayuan's resignation has 
removed the person who would be primarily responsible for ABET 
preparation.  At the last SoE ABET meeting this problem was discussed 
and it was decided that a new EE ABET coordinator needed to be found 
immediately.  I spoke to several of you regarding this position.  It 
became apparent that with so few EE faculty available for service 
appointments and both Claire and Ben serving on major Academic Senate 
Committees there was really no one who could do this very important 
job properly.

At this point Tracy Larrabee graciously and generously volunteered to 
be the coordinator for both CE and EE. To perform this job 
effectively Tracy needs to become, in effect, an EE department 
member.  Tracy is already an EE associated faculty (under the 
diamonds) because of her interest in VLSI.  In this ABET role she 
will coordinate ABET preparation for EE, assigning tasks to EE 
faculty and providing a resource for questions about preparation.

To provide the cooperation that Tracy needs to help EE effectively in 
this role, I propose that Tracy be added to the EEfac email alias and 
attend EE faculty meetings at her discretion.  I have already spoken 
to many of you about this, but please let me have any further 
comments that you wish to express.   To be successful in our quest of 
ABET accreditation EE faculty and staff must support Tracy by 
handling the ABET tasks she requests of us promptly and with high 
quality results.

To support Tracy in this effort there will be an ABET committee 
within EE which will perform the most needed ABET tasks that are not 
more appropriately done by individual faculty.  I have already spoken 
to several faculty who have agreed to serve on this committee.  For 
this quarter Holger Schmidt, Don Wiberg (when he is again able) and 
myself will constitute the ABET committee.  Beginning in January Mike 
Isaacson, Ali Shakouri, Don Wiberg and myself will be on the ABET 
committee.

Please convey your thanks to Tracy for her generous service to us in 
EE and the School of Engineering.

Best regards, John
