The three papers that we read this week deal with performance of P2P 
systems. The 

first one examines the "small-world phenomenon" - the principle that we 
are all 

linked by short chains of acquaintances, and its effect on the design of 
P2P 

systems. In this paper the authors prove that no decentralized algorithm, 

operating with local information only, can construct short paths in the 
family of 

recently proposed network models that are rich in short paths with 
non-negligible 

probability. They then show that there is a unique model within the 
family for 

which decentralized algorithms are effective. 
 This results in the conclusion that 

in addition to having short paths, a network should contain latent 
structural 

cues that can be used to guide a message towards a target, which means 
that 

minimizing the transmission rate of a network is not necessarily the same 
as 

minimizing its diameter. The second paper compares the performance of 
Freenet and 

Gnutella. The two systems are compared along the lines of performance, 
fault 

taulerance and scalability. While both Frenet and Gnutella are 
decentralized 

systems, Freenet relies on the "small-world phenomenon", while Gnutella 
doesn't. 

In terms of performance, Freenet has good average but bad worst case 
performance. 

Gnutella makes a tradeoff of a much greater search effort for optimal 
paths and 

better worst case performance. Since highly connected nodes are much less 
a 

factor in Gnutella than in Freenet, Gnutella is better at handling 
attacks but 

worse at handling failures. Freenet scales better than Gnutella, scaling 

logarithmically compared with linearly for Gnutella. The third paper 
compares the 

performance of Gnutella and Napster. This paper shows that bandwidth, 
latency, 

availability, and the degree of sharing vary between three and five 
orders of 

magnitude across the peers in both Gnutella and Napster. It also shows 
that peers 

tend to deliberately misreport information if there is an incentive to do 
so and 

that the download capacities of both systems exceed their upload 
capacities. 

Finally it points out the fact that Gnutella has a large portion of 
freeriders. 

This means that a large percentage of clients rely on a small percentage 
of 

servers, which in turn means that the system is highly vulnerable to 
targeted 

attacks. It seems that it should be possible to design an unstructured 
P2P system 

that performs as well as a structured one. However, when designing such a 
system 

several things must be kept in mind: the "small-world phenomenon" is your 
friend 

- use it; different peers have significant differences in their abilities 
and the 

system should take that into account; freeloaders are a problem because 
they not 

only take up system resources but can also make the system vulnerable to 
failures 

and attacks, thus there have to be strong incentives for people not to 
freeload.
