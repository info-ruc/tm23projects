Dear Colleague:

I am sending this email to call your attention to the availability of 
some highly desirable postdoctoral positions at the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).  The National Research 
Council (NRC) Postdoctoral Associateships (tenable at NIST) are among 
the most prestigious postdoctoral positions in the United States. 
Consequently, an NRC Postdoctoral Associateship may serve adequately 
as a stepping stone to a variety of successful career paths, both 
within and outside of NIST.

NIST employs approximately 3000 staff and is truly a world class 
scientific research institute with expertise in a very broad range of 
disciplines. The combination of state-of-the-art instrumentation and 
first rate research personnel makes for a stimulating and challenging 
environment. As such, it is an excellent place to gain postdoctoral 
experience. In addition to the intellectual and career benefits, the 
NRC Postdoctoral Associate also receives an exceptional compensation 
package, including an annual salary (for 2003) of $55,700 and full 
benefits.

We have several opportunities in the area of nuclear analytical 
chemistry (see below). These are written very generically to provide 
a large umbrella to contain most areas of research in analytical 
chemistry using neutrons.   We have excellent facilities including a 
20 MW, D2O cooled and moderated, research reactor that is the best 
reactor in the world for analytical chemistry measurements, and the 
leader in neutron sciences in the Americas. 

In case any of your graduate students are unaware of the NIST 
opportunities, I would like to request that you pass this message on 
to them. For those who may be interested in getting further 
information about the NRC Postdoctoral Associateship Program at NIST, 
general information can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www4.nas.edu/pga/rap.nsf/vwLabInformation/03AF8E43C706150B852567FB004AB8E8?OpenDocument&50~NIST.">http://www4.nas.edu/pga/rap.nsf/vwLabInformation/03AF8E43C706150B852567FB004AB8E8?OpenDocument&amp;50~NIST.</A>

Finally, I should point out that the application deadline for this 
year's competition is February 1, 2003. Since the application process 
is rather involved, time is of the essence for anyone interested in 
applying this year. Also, I need to emphasize that the NRC 
Postdoctoral Associateship Program at NIST is available to US 
citizens ONLY. Unfortunately, this is an absolutely inflexible rule.

Thank you for your time in reading this message and in passing it on 
to your students. If anyone is interested in applying for a position 
in my laboratory, he or she may contact me directly, or the advisors 
listed below. My phone number is 301-975-6285, my fax number is 
301-208-9279, and my email address is <A HREF="mailto:robert.greenberg@nist.gov.">robert.greenberg@nist.gov.</A>

Nuclear Analytical Chemistry Opportunities at NIST

Bulk Chemical Analysis and Depth Profiling Using Neutron Beams (50.83.91.B1718)
	Richard M. Lindstrom  (301-975-6281)
	George P.  Lamaze  (301-975-6202)

The use of prompt radiations from nuclear reactions has become a 
major tool for elemental analysis and compositional mapping. Two 
techniques are in use: neutron-capture prompt-gamma-ray activation 
analysis (PGAA) and neutron depth profiling (NDP), each of which 
employs both thermal- and cold-neutron beams from the NIST Reactor. 
PGAA is used to determine a suite of elements that are inaccessible 
by conventional neutron activation analysis (e.g., H [of special 
interest], B, C, and N), as well as those with large capture cross 
sections (e.g., Cd, Gd, Sm, Hg). NDP measures the depth distribution 
of nuclides that emit charged particles on slow-neutron capture. 
Research includes method development, focusing on improved 
specificity, accuracy, sensitivity, and spatial resolution through 
detailed studies of the interaction of neutrons and their products 
with samples and detectors.

Instrumental, Radiochemical, and Preconcentration Neutron Activation 
Analysis (50.83.91.B1719)
	Robert R. Greenberg  (301-975-6285)
	Richard M. Lindstrom   (301-975-6281)
	Rick L Paul   (301-975-6287)

Neutron activation analysis (NAA) provides the sensitivity, 
selectivity, and capability for multielemental determinations that 
are often required for the role of trace elements in biological, 
environmental, and materials analysis studies. Because of their 
unique capabilities, the various NAA techniques frequently play an 
important role in the certification of elemental concentrations in 
NIST Standard Reference Materials. The accuracy and precision of 
various forms of NAA are ultimately limited by the precision of 
counting statistics that may be a few tenths of a percent, in 
favorable cases. However, to achieve this accuracy level, all other 
error sources must be reduced to comparable levels. Experimental and 
computational studies may address new and improved chemical 
separation procedures, neutron and gamma-ray interactions with 
analytical samples and detectors, high-accuracy neutron flux 
monitoring, high and varying count-rate gamma-ray spectrometry, peak 
integration routines, and gamma-ray and fast-neutron interferences. 
Various nuclear spectrometry equipment, laboratory facilities, 
personal and minicomputer facilities, and the irradiation facilities 
of the NIST research reactor are available for this work.


Applications of Nuclear Multi-Element Analyses in Environment 
Sciences (50.83.91.B5233)
	Elizabeth A. Mackey   (301-975-5149)
	Robert R. Greenberg  (301-975-6285)

Multi-element analytical techniques are often used in environmental 
science to characterize and quantify element composition of samples 
when a limited amount of material is available. Element signatures 
have been used to determine the sources of particles in air, identify 
the source of geologic materials, and to help assess effects of 
element exposure on human and animal health.  Instrumental neutron 
activation analysis and prompt gamma-ray activation analysis are used 
to determine up to 40 elements in a single sample.  Research in this 
area involves advancing neutron activation analysis techniques for 
quantitative evaluation of environmental samples including sediments, 
soils, and air particles, and various types of biological tissues 
ranging from bivalves to human liver.
