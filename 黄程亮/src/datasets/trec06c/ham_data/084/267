The measurement paper compares the true-P2p system Gnutella and the more 

centralized Napster.  Unfortunately, the paper does little comparison of
the 

two protocols themselves and instead focuses on comparing
characteristics of 

the user populations of both systems.  This does allow them to draw some 

interesting conclusions, however.  The primary contribution is to
suggest that 

since hosts on the Internet differ greatly (by many orders of magnitude)
in 

bandwidth, latency, processing power, etc. future P2P networks should be 

designed to make optimal use of this.  (and in fact KaZaa and Grokster
do this) 

 They also observe that hosts tend to lie about their statistics, and
therefore 

there needs to be incentives for hosts to be truthful or measurements 

(bandwidth, latency) need to be actively taken.

Kleinberg's small world paper presents background on the small world
conjecture 

and discusses Milgram's original experiment.  Milgram's original work
claims 

that the diameter of social networks is small (< 6) and furthermore that
a path 

from any individual to another can be recovered using only "local"
knowledge of 

each person.  This translates to many other networks and the hope is
that we 

can design these overlay networks to behave like small worlds and thus
allow 

for bounded (and small) routing times.  Kleinberg discusses how to
design and 

grow networks so that this small world property emerges.  This paper
seems to 

suggest that an unstructured network (if it behaves like a small world)
is 

similar to a structured one and, in theory, might perform just as well.

The P2P Performance chapter from O'Reilly quickly dismisses any system
that is 

in any way centralized and gives a comparison of the "true P2P" systems 

Gnutella and Freenet.  They too discuss the small world property and its 

application to these systems.  Freenet has the small world property as
one of 

its design goals and this chapter discusses it at length.  The Gnutella 

discussion suggests that the network can be quickly flooded and
unreliable.  

Furthermore, Gnutella can't really play the small world card to help its
case.  

This paper also discusses "free-riding" (removing resources from the
network 

without donating any in return) and even goes so far as to call it a
failure 

mode.  Clearly something needs to be done to incentivize nodes to share.

Design constraints that exist in P2P networks are as follows:

(1) There is a limited amount of network power underneath the overlay
network.  

Bandwidth, latency, etc. need to be used efficiently.

(2) A certain percentage of hosts are unwilling or at least reluctant to
share 

resources with the rest of the network.  A scheme needs to be designed 

to provide the necessary incentive.

(3) Some nodes have much more bandwidth, lower latency, more compute
cycles, 

etc. than others.  This heterogenity needs to be exploited by having
some nodes 

do more work, maintain more connections, etc.  This can further be
supported by 

the incentive scheme of #2
