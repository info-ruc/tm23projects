If we have that option for free I would say we should take it. RedHat 7.2 is
much more advanced than RH6.2 as you all know. Plus we can install the more
recent patches.

How our schedule changes because of this. Does it mean we are canceling the
event (recompiling the kernel) on Thursday morning, or you want to keep it
as an exercise. Or doing a backup and building an RH7.2 is what we need to
do instead at that time.

Do you want me to prepare all necessary things for RedHat 7.2 installation?
