Greetings,

As you can see, the cluster is now 100% up!

The secondary master holds an image of the primary master now.

The 2.4 kernel should have your process table limits problem solved.
I will ask Markus to send you a link to the documentation for the Nimbus
system.

You can pull up a graphical display of cluster status from X. In the menu,
select ClusterTools->wakinyanmon



We now return you to your regularly scheduled computing.....

G'day,
sjames
