The first paper is a discussion of the "Small-World Phenomenon" from an algorithmic
perspective. It studies the correlation between the local structure and the long-range
connections of a node in a network which are deciding factors in its capability to
efficiently route messages to any other node on the network. The second paper further makes
use of this observation and carries out two case studies involving Freenet and Gnutella.
 
The theoretical analysis, based on the Small-Word Phenomenon, shows that given a critical
threshold correlation, it is possible to route messages in an efficient manner regardless of
the nature of the underlying graph. For example, for a regular graph, the high level of
clustering leads to highly optimized local routing but poor average global pathlength. On
the other end of the spectrum, random graphs exhibit exactly the opposite trends. The
intermediate cases, which are more representative of P2P systems such as Freenet or
Gnutella, however show desirable characteristics. Locally, they show high degree of
clustering, while at a global level, the pathlength drops approximately to that of a random
graph. The second paper presents detailed simulations results confirming this behavior in
both Freenet and Gnutella. This essentially implies that unstructured P2P systems, which are
what any decentralized P2P systems are, do have the ability to perform as well as more
structured systems.
 
There are a number of constraints that need to be taken into consideration during the design
phase of a P2P system. System lifetime dictates the average lifespan of a node on the
network as an end-user machine could go offline, crash, or simply become active anytime.
Designers also have to work with a bottleneck link bandwidth which is the slowest hop
between any two nodes on a P2P network. Since its a physical property of a network, it
remains constant so long the same path is used. Freeloaders are another constraint that
needs to be addressed. More specifically, there has to be policied defined regarding how to
handle these nodes that are not sharing files or participating in the network by providing
information to help routing. Finally, much consideration also has to be given to the
trustworthiness of the information a node provides about itself to other users.
Should this be determined by the system? Bandwidth information or type of connection, for
example, can easily be falsely provided by a node.
