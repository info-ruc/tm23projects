Agree with a lot of thios but he missed a big point.  NASA and the other 
programs didn't fail to evolve.  They were designed as one shot "money is no 
object" race programs.  Expecting them to evolve into a program fostering 
commercial development, or opening th final frounteer, is like rexpecting a 
Indy racer to evolve into family sedan.  

NASA responds to congress, and comerce isn't their busness.  Further, it 
would so overshadow them, as to doom them back to a technolygy reseach 
agency.  So they don't really want to support it.

On the contrary, it did what was demanded of it.  Its manufacture costs were 
shuffled out to all the right districts.  It looks pretty impressive. Good 
political PR.  Keeps a huge NASA staff employed in the right congressional 
districts.  etc.

I was in the shutle and statin programs, and they ae not driven by what you 
think.  Stations design was optimized to utilize shuttle a lot to make it 
look good, and designed to involve a lot of internatinals.  The cost was 
stageringly increased costs for us, greatly extended developoment times, and 
greatly reduced capacity and size.  But those were not big issues.


NASA is about providing political specticals, not commerce - science - or 
economic growth.

True.  A major commercial, or competeing government, launch program would 
cost them turf.   
NASA is about providing political specticals, they can't do that if they ae 
just one of many in space doing the same kinds of things; and they don't want 
to take the chance of doing something new and risky on the frouteers of space 
or technology.

Or the politicians.  ;)

Gov agencies respond to voter interests, and responce.  Specticals wor -- as 
long as they can keep control.

More then that, they ae far more woried about bad press from someone doing 
the wrong thing, or worse saying the wrong thing, then they are at limiting 
themself.

This however is often the view of politicians - who love such planing, or the 
public - who fears the chaos as well.  Prefers safty.

Of course it was the military that developed and built the internet.  Banks 
and industry that made the conputers and telecomunication gear.  No hackers 
using equipment they built themselves opened the digital frounteer.  They 
were just like the "pioneers" who settled the west after the towns weer 
built, regular railroad service established, and tons of dime novels and 
woild west shows popularized the "wind west".

The real follks opening space won't be mountain men in furs, or pioneers in 
conastoga wagons.  No lone prospectors with a mule and a pan.  It'll have to 
be mega corps that can put up the money for the fleets and the platforms in 
space.  And they will demand and enforce you major laws.

Problem is there is no place in space unless you build it.  And they must be 
big and therfore expensive.

No space just shows how much that real living costs, provinding GREED is
not involved. Space was never marketed for people living there, other wise
we would have TRANSPORTATION to SPACE NOW!  A good sci-anime is
"The wings of Honneamise" that is about the first man in to space
on a planet other than EARTH. This shows how complex it is to get into
space. Until we FORCE people to thing of transportation first we will
never go anywhere.
