Greetings,

Found it!
It looks like all of the newline chars in the scripts got translated to
the MS <cr><lf> convention. Since the exec system call doesn't see
anything special about <cr>, it tried to interpret it, so it attempted to
run the script with /bin/sh<cr>

It doesn't make things any easier that the only way to see that was to
hexdump the text!

I have renamed the node_up and setup_libs appending -02-nov-08 should you
want to look at that. I then scp'ed clean versions in. The cluster should
boot now.
G'day,
sjames
