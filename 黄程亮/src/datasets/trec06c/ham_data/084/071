I don't think he "missed" the point, but you are on track about its original
genesis and goal. Which is the point, it was a bureaucracy established to
accomplish one thing only, which it did very well. However, the nature of
bureaucracies is not to evolve, but to  grow and protect themselves. The
analogy of the Indy racer and the family sedan was very apt.

Each represents a separate entity, not an evolution of one into the other.
Granted, much of what is learned from Indy racing eventually get
incorporated into the family sedan. The engine in my truck began life as a
race car engine design. Which is what should have happened (and still
should) to NASA. It should be the one testing the technologies that no
company feels comfortable putting in to the family sedan.

No, commerce per se, is not the business of Congress. Protecting commerce
and furthering commerce on the other hand, IS the business of Congress. As
such, perhaps what is needed is to put space transportation (as opposed to
research) into the hands of a different government agency, like maybe the
DOT or FAA or some such. Note, that I am not saying that they will
physically run the shuttle fleet, merely administer its operations. The
actual ownership and day to day running should lie in the hands of private
industry.

Of course, this assumes that ANY agency will be interested in promoting
access to space, see my point further below about the government's vested
interest in denying ANYBODY access.


> NASA is about providing political specticals, not commerce -
> science - or economic growth.

All to true, which is what I was saying above. Of course, they are under
directions from Congress to provide these spectacles. NASA's mission is
ultimately designed by Congress. So if NASA's mission in snot what it should
be, we have only ourselves to blame.

Again, this is Congress. Keeping other countries, and by extension, private
industry, out of space access effectively allows are government to control
the high ground. Unrestricted access would make it almost impossible to
guarantee the security of our country, our "turf", but not in the sense that
you meant it...

Well, the entrepreneur thrives in chaos, because with chaos comes
opportunity, as well as danger. The public (as an entity) on the other hand
fears chaos for danger it brings, it wants only safety, which is ultimately
dichotic because the entrepreneurs that embrace at the individual level are
part of the larger entity that fears it. Naturally, the government, whose
responsibility it is to see to the public safety also fears the chaos.

This is ultimately self defeating because the better a job they do of
protecting us from this chaos, the less healthy the system as a whole
becomes. The chaos is necessary for a healthy and thriving society and a
society where it doesn't exist in sufficient measure eventually collapses.

I think you missed the point here entirely, chiefly because you got caught
up in what you perceived as an error in what was after all, only an analogy.
His point in this analogy was not that the Internet was built by hackers,
but rather pioneered by them. They caused the change and growth in DARPANET
into what is now the Internet.

But that isn't really relevant to what he was trying to say. The thrust of
what he was saying agrees with and reinforces what you said above about
NASA. When NASA was first established, it was populated by just the sort of
"dropouts, crooks, pirates, gamblers and misfits" that he is talking about.
No they weren't actually those sorts of people, but that represents the
character traits essential to risk takers. True, these risk takers also
possessed brains, guts, determination and discipline in varying degrees, but
they weren't bureaucrats (yet). Risk taking, and the inevitable accidents
that went with it were expected - not encouraged mind you - but expected.

Today's NASA is a whole different animal. Risk taking is anathema at NASA.
Even looking like you once had a reckless brain cell is bad news there. NASA
will not and indeed cannot ever be the vehicle for moving us into space. The
very lack of risk taking in their corporate culture and in their mandate
from Congress guarantees that it will never happen. What they can do and
should be doing, is research. Building and testing the technology necessary
for others to do what NASA cannot.

On the other hand, the entity, be it an individual, a corporation or
whatever, that does move us into space  must resemble his list of "dropouts,
crooks, pirates, gamblers and misfits", whatever they may actually be.
Without the traits that make those people what they are, even a mega
corporation is not going to be able to do the job.

Although the point you make about the amounts of money required are correct
and almost require the backing of large multinationals, the corporate ethic
that drives such corporations is even more of a risk suppressor than what
NASA is experiencing. Which explains why few mega corporations are willing
to get into the space game except in a peripheral way.

NASA, or rather NACA, was a increadable aeronautical research agency that 
made huge advances in aeronautics.  But that was a long time ago, and NASA as 
spectical producer with little if any time for such research, has been the 
rule since it formed.

Personally I badly want NASA forced out of the space launch busness.  Turn 
Kennedy over to the FAA or Florida or something.  Contract launch services to 
commerce launch companies etc.  Get back just into reseach, aeronautical or 
space related.

Not that NASA wouldn't fight tooth and nail to stop that.

Except its not the military that trying to restrict access, but NASA.  NASA 
even tried to force the military out of space.

Thou the Clinton Whitehouse did squelch space launcher research specifically 
to limit access for security reasons.

No, it was populated by a bunch of senior engineers in shirts ties and crew 
cuts.  Very conformist experts in their fields with years of good performance 
in industries.  I.E. mega governments contracting to mega corps.  Hell even 
the Astrounauts found they wanted squeeky clean more then great pilots.  They 
guys they first hired wern't as squeeky cleen as they would heve liked, but 
they weer the most confirmist they could get out of the test pilot corps of 
the air force, and they put a lot of effort to push and test them to make 
sure they .

Later more "correct" astrounauts were selected.

I've seen mega-corps drill for oil in the deep ocean, in the arctic, etc.  Do 
mines in the tops of mountains, deeps of jjungles, etc.

Corps are quite willing and able to take risk and handel frounteers.  Even 
hire some real characters to work out there.  BUT -- they need to see money 
at the end of it.  So far there is nothing out there thats a real draw.

The focus of the origional editorial seemed to be that it would not / could 
not be the big powerfull corps or organizations, but would be radical 
nonconformists.  Folks like the individuals who went out on their own and 
pioneered the west on the lawless frounteer.  But it is the big corps and 
organizations, with their demands for reasonable order, that pioneer on the 
kind of nasty frounteers we do now on earth, or will do in space.  They won't 
be crooks and pirates, because such folk get each other killed and are to 
much trouble to put up with.  They will be agressive, arogent, probably often 
not real polite, or not conformists.  But not exactly crooks or pirates.

Yeah I've noticed that dead or not, it still gets the occasional hit. Wish
one of us had time to burn...

Gee, Kelly, you agreed and disagreed in the same sentence! Well almost the
same sentence...yes the mega corps do take risks, very calculated,
quantified, limited, demarcated .... but still, risks. That is not quite the
same as sending a mission after an asteroid that might, MIGHT, have
unimaginable riches inside it, and maybe, MAYBE being able to extract them.
Losing a man to a construction site accident on a drilling platform barely
makes headlines, just an obit. Losing a man on an asteroid extraction
operation would just about put the company out of business. Not the same
risk at all.

You mean people like Rutan, Benson, Kelly and Kistler don't qualify? Gee,
you just broke my romantic heart <G>. Seriously, I think you were taking his
reference to rogues, pirates and misfits a little too literally. It may well
end up being some mega corp that leads the drive into space, but there will
a person or people in charge of that corp who have that spirit he was
talking about. I just wish them luck with the board of directors...

Yeah.  Should do something with it.

If it would cost that much, the thing could be made of gold and still be 
worthless.  Companies risking their existence on the next big deal is more 
common then you think.  Its almost the rule in aerospace.  Its why aerospace 
is considered such a risky game to play.

Na not even close.

Given he went on to a long rambling salute to the glories of lawlessness and 
chaos, to the point of almost suggesting ruthless criminals are cool, I think 
I should?

I think we agree more then he would have.

;)

Yes, its going to be won by folks backed by executivs with a lot of guts, and 
enough charisma to get folks to sign over a few billion bucks to be a part of 
that dream.

Date: Thu, 17 Oct 2002 11:46:44 +0100

After shooting through the deep black for a number of years, accelerating,
breaking, plus any little accidents the ship may have, there probably
wouldn't be much fuel left, so I came to wonder about refueling and came up
with a couple of ideas.
These ideas assume a fusion-based power plant using hydrogen or other light
elements.

First off, gas clouds.  Assuming no legistation has been passed banning the
use/destruction of these immense features, my first thought was to extract
fuel from these.  Much like a bussard ram-scoop, suck in gas and store/use
it (btw, is there any reason a bussard scoop couldn't use an electrostatic
feild rather than magnetic?).  However, there's not much gas in this area of
space, unless you count gas-giants.
Now, gas-giants are something that are already being picked up orbiting
other stars, so perhaps some form of fuel-harvesting craft would be a
usefull adition to the ships complement?
Of course the atsmosphere of a giant is unlikely to be pure H, so a form of
distilery would be needed, which is also needed for my second thought.

Planetary rings. Now, although the rings are unlikely to be pure ice (as in
Asimov's "The Martian Way"), they would likely contain some, as well as
other solidified chemicals.  I perceived the idea of some sort of harpoon,
armoured and equipped with heating elements in the center, vapouring ice and
slush and forcing it up a hose to the ship for processing and distiling.  If
I recall correctly, tests have shown there are also a lot of simple
alchohols in space-born clouds, so perhaps there may be in other forms too.
Anyway, having equipment that can extract the H from any molecule containing
it would be useful.

Leaving a permenant fuelign station in place on a large iceberg seemed also
like a good idea at first, but changing the mass of one like that would also
change it's behavior and send it out of a previously stable configuration
(again, as happened in "The Martian Way").


A few thoughts for people to read,

Peter
