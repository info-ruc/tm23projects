The Kleinberg paper presents an explanation of the small world phenomenon,
by which decentralized clustered networks (like those of personal human
relationships) can contain short paths between nodes due to the presence of
the appropriate quantities of long-distance links. It seems to suggest that
an unstructured peer-to-peer network can perform as well as a structured one
if the appropriate distribution of short- and long-distance links is
achieved.

The book chapter does case studies on the performance of Freenet and
Gnutella. Freenet relies on its network having the small world property;
there exists a small set of highly connected nodes, allowing for short
routes between arbitrary pairs of peers. Gnutella networks do not exploit
any kind of small world effect, since queries are broadcast. This hurts
scalability and bandwidth usage. A suggestion is made to improve Gnutella
by imposing some hierarchical structure to improve the average path length.

The Saroiu paper compares Napster (a structured peer-to-peer network) and
Gnutella (an unstructured peer-to-peer network) in terms of the
characteristics of the individual nodes. The first big result of the study
is that there is significant heterogeneity among peers in both networks, 
suggesting that a peer-to-peer system should make use of information about
the differences between nodes (in terms of latencies, bandwidths, uptimes,
and activity) to work more efficiently. This would be of particular
importance in Freenet where the small set of highly connected nodes which
serve to provide the short paths would ideally all have high-bandwidth
network connections. The second big result is that there is a remarkable
amount of selfishness present among the peers of both networks. Many users
do not bother to accurately represent their advertised bandwidths, and 
very, very few users actually provide content for others to download, or 
stay online long enough to make it useful. The majority of users simply
connect, download some files, and then disconnect.

It would seem that it is possible for a decentralized network to perform
as well as a structured one, but there are many conditions that would
have to hold. The small-world property is necessary, and as Freenet has
shown, it is possible to achieve. Peers would need to be able to measure
the properties of other peers, without having to rely on voluntarily
advertised information. Some type of scheme for ensuring that all nodes  
contribute to the global network would vastly improve performance.
