CORRECTION:  CERT Advisory CA-2002-29 Buffer Overflow in Kerberos
Administration Daemon


October 28, 2002


The initial version of CERT Advisory CA-2002-29, sent on 2002-10-25,
contained incorrect references to Debian and SuSE security advisories.
This error has been corrected on our web site.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-178 and SuSE Security Advisory SuSE-
SA:2002:034 DO NOT address the vulnerability described in CA-2002-29
and VU#875073.

Debian has confirmed that they are affected and are working on
patches.  Updated information about Debian will be posted as soon as
it is available.

As noted in their statement, SuSE includes Heimdal Kerberos with
Kerberos 4 support disabled.

For the most current information, including which systems are affected
and vendor statements, please see the following documents:
