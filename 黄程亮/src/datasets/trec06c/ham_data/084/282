The small-world phenomenon itself says that people in the world are all
linked by short chains of acquaintances. Imported to networks, it lays the
basis structure for peer-to-peer system on network level and assures the
connectivity of nodes in p2p system. The model of Watts and Strogatz, in
fact, has already been used in Chord routing scheme, in which the structure
parameter r (introduced in the paper as measuring of "networked", 0--uniform
distribution over long-distance contacts, 2--uniform distribution over
"distance scales" in a 2-D lattice) equals to 0. This paper shows that in
the present models, the decentralized algorithm for constructing shortest
paths is impossible. The decentralized algorithms are only effective in the
model with r at its optimum value of 2, namely the long-distance contacts
distribute uniformly over distance.

The "performance" chapter  focuses on the aspects of querying performance
(in terms of time and bandwidth consumed), fault tolerance and scaling with
case study on Freenet and Gnutella. For Freenet to work, two conditions must
hold: connectivity and being a small-world, because the only difference
between Freenet and Milgram's experiment on small world is that the target
in Freenet can be one of many peers with desired file and if Freenet is a
small world, the short paths will be assured. The Web is a small world with
pathlength of 19 is shown in another paper. The authors use the similar
simulation show that the Freenet can be also a small world network. Fault
tolerance is also measured and it shows that nodes failing of less than 30%
will not cause serious degrade in it. Also Freenet is effective in combat
free riders by maintaining references in each node. Similar as small world
model, Freenet scales logarithmically with the size of the network. Gnutella
however, uses a simple broadcast model and doesn't invoke small-world
effect. It offers faster search and better worst-case guarantees, but it is
vulnerable to free-riders and scales linearly which is not as good as Freene
t.

The measurement study raised the issue of significant heterogeneity and lack
of cooperation across peers in current peer-to-peer systems (Gnutella and
Napster in this paper) by showing the percentage of host and that upstream
and downstream bandwidth, the latencies, the number of shared, downloaded
and uploaded files can be differ greatly among peers. So when designing
future robust p2p protocols, special care should be taken to the assumption
of homogeneous nodes and willingness to cooperate over all peers.
