   Are your sure?  I can't find any reference to langfe at all, anywhere.

   Well this person certainly wins the award for doing needless things that 
break DMDX.  To remove a keyword from the file open the .RTF file in a text 
editor and replace all occurrences of the keyword followed by a space with 
nothing and then just the keyword with nothing, for instance, "\langfe " 
with "" and then "\langfe" with "".  It's important to do the first search 
and replace before the second one.
