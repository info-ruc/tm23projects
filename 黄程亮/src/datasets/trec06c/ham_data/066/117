Dear Sir,
  I am a student who is doing a mobile robot project. Since I am really
a freshman in Robotics. So, I would like to ask you to help me to solve
some problems met in my project. Please forgive me if my questions are
too simple!
  My aim for the robot is to make a mobile robot with a manipulutor. The
mobile robot can run autonomously around a room and avoid obstacles during
moving. Then, if it meet its target object during its path, it can notice
the postion of the object and pick it up. Then, it carries it to the
target preset distination.
  I have built the mobile platform by using the lynxmotion's first step
kit which consists the basic stamp one controller. Also, I use the IRPD
detector module of Lynxmotion for the obstacle avoiding. But since the
program momery of the basic stamp one is too small for containing the
platform and the manipulator together. So, I am going to change to use the
handyboard from MIT Lab.
  And now, my problem is that I have no idea on how the robot can identify
the target objects. I do haven't any basic concept on that. Can you please
first teach me so basic knowledge on object identification first.
  Thank you very much!
                                                     Raymond Law
