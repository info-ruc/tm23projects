I finally got some time and tried to put together the sonar assembly we
purchased from Acroname (unit R14-SONAR1 - Instrument Grade Kit). All the
wires are jury-rigged up (didn't want to permanently afix them yet) but they
seem to all be making contact with what they should be contacting and nothing
else. However, the sonar_display() function from the official HandyBoard sonar
page just keeps displaying values around 700-1000 no matter how far away or
near I place an obstacle. is this indicative of some common error? I saw the
note on the page about placing a capacitor at the C7 position which I think I
did, but I'm not sure. This is the only component I am not sure is making
proper contact. Could this be the problem?

Thx
