Sorry to trouble the list with more control word problems, but now the
offending control word is \langfe.

I tried what worked previously (save as Word x.doc, shut off and reopen and
save as rtf) and it didn't work this time. I went into DOS to look at the
doc--> rtf file and saw the bugger \langfe all over the place. 

I must explain that one reason I keep encountering this problem is that I
can't be there when much of the editing is done, and the person who is
doing the entering (going in and substituting Chinese for the instructiond
and stimuli in a good-running English version) is well-versed in Word but
not WordPad, which is a bit less friendly. 

anyway I'm now getting very close to a workable Chinese version so any help
would be appreciated.
