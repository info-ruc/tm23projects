Hi all

I just recieved a new Eltec Pyroelectric sensor from acroname and have been
messing around with it on my bot.
In the booklet it says that the sensor is a Human Motion detector as apposed
to a human presence detector.
when there is a heat source directly in front of it, it reads 128 from
analog(), but the same value is returned when there is absolutely no heat.

Does anybody know how i could get get it to tell the difference between heat
/ no heat??

Thanks

Ross
