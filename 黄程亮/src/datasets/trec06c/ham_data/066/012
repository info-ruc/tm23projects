If the card is a fairly recent ATI Rage-based one then the 'mach64' code
in the Plan 9 CD distribution won't handle it. We probably have code to do it
but it would require so much extra stuff it would be best to wait for it
to be bundled up somehow. I believe others in the Plan 9 community have Rage
cards working, perhaps someone else can help.

If you look in the BIOS for another "MACH64xx" string near 0xC00F0 the two
letters 'xx' would let me know if it is supported or not.
