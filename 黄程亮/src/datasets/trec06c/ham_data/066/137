Just to say, the syntax I gave for this *is* correct.  I've 
created a new file and it works fine now.  I can't work out 
what was wrong with the old one since they say the 
same thing (don't know if it made a difference that I was 
trying it on a laptop).  Thank you for your replies and 
sorry for the bother.  

Rachel
