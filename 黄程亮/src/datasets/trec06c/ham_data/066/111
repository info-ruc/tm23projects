>>is it possible to imagine to port plan9 (what is the difference with
>>inferno) for psion revo ?

you could certainly imagine it.  there is a strongarm compiler suite (if that's what revo uses),
for instance.  is all the information about the hardware available?  that's the usual
show stopper.

plan9 and inferno are closely related in many ways, but there are big differences:
best to regard them as different systems.  to be more helpful: if you can port one,
porting the other is not too hard because the device driver interface and
kernel infrastructures are broadly similar (although there has undoubtedly been divergence).
inferno already has useful kernel and JIT support for certain strongarm
implementations, which plan9 (i believe) currently does not.
then again, if you're mainly interested in running C programs, or porting Ansi/Posix
applications (cf. APE), Inferno won't be much help.
