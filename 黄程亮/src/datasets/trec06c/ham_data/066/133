A while ago, Matt Davis talked about using the line keyword 
to present multiple lines of text:

0 <ln 0> "Hello", <ln 2> "World";

I can get this to work fine, but I can't get DMDX to do the 
same thing for my experimental items.  I want to present 
two words, one above the other.  Of course, I could create 
loads of bitmaps, but it would be much simpler if I could 
just specify what I want in an .rtf file.  

The script I have been trying to use is the following:

+1 " "/ "+"/ * <ln -1> "beg", <ln 1> "leg" ;

I get an error message saying 'No media File Name' which I 
don't get when I leave out the line keywords.

Does anyone have any suggestions?  

Thank you.
Rachel
