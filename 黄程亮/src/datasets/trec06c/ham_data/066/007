I was able to boot the PC correctly after install from CD. Comes out that
I was using the old CD. Now, I can use the video card in generic
640x4801x1 (with monitor option set for vga). The card in question is

ATI 3D Charger IIC/4Mb RAM

card documentation says that it can do dotclock to 80MHz
ramdac is "3D Rage II" at 170Mhz

aux/vga finds a string at

0xC0085="ATI MACH64 BIOS P/N 113-40606-112"

link=vga
ctrl=mach64

if I use the above three lines in /lib/vgadb the screen goes blank and
stays blank.

Any pointers?
