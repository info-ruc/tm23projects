is there a website that gives a side-by-side comparison of the features of the
handyboard vs. the RCX?  i'm giving a series of talks to professors about the
rcx and robolab, and some of them have asked about the handyboard, but i don't
know a whole lot about it.

if you could bcc me at ben@alum.mit.edu that would be great.

i'm also looking for a similar side-by-side comparison of robolab vs. other
programming environments.  i.e. are there other languages for the rcx that can
do as much as robolab can?  piano player, internet control, data analysis
(fft, etc.) with LabVIEW, graphing package, direct control over the net,
etc.???
