  Bingo.  Put .1uf caps (rated at least 4X your max voltage) from the (+)
pole to the can, from the (-) pole to the can and from the (+) to the (-)
pole.  Keep your leads as short as possible.  Put a big cap (1000uf+) on the
power supply TO your motor contoller, this will help reduce sags on the main
power line to your HB regulator (if you use the same power line.)

  You will probably have to file a spot on the can to solder to and you WILL
need a strong soldering iron.

This should help.
