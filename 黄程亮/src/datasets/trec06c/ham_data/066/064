Hello,

I am trying to get back to Plan9 (2nd edition). I have been able
to install the CD to a standalone PC with LAN connection. The card
is correctly recognized (ne2000/0x300/10). I want this box to
talk to other machines on LAN (UNIX boxes), and would appreciate
the steps to achieve this.

I know that it needs:

ip-address
netmask
dns?
gateway-addr
protocol?

but in what files does the info go? I put entries in /lib/ndb/local

ip=141.xxx.xxx.xxx	ether=0040095E21234	sys=abcd
netmask=255.255.xxx.xxx
dom=abcd.cps.cmich.edu
ipgw=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (dns in the dept)
proto=tcp

but does not seem to do anything.
Is there a howto document on this?
