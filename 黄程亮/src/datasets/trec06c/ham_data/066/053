   Ok, so there's a new DMDX that's immune to the 15 or so control words 
that Jerry Packard's assistant managed to introduce into his Chinese RTF 
item file for him.  This might not be the end of it, my syntax check of his 
item file stops due to a missing frame separator.  At some time in the 
future I'll make DMDX just ignore all RTF control words that it doesn't 
understand, the reason it doesn't do so now is that in developing the thing 
it was impossible to determine ahead of time the control words that were 
necessary to know about.  Given the fact that we're a year or two down the 
road it might be safe enough to start ignoring everything else, of course 
doing so opens a pandora's box of inexplicable display behavior so I'll 
probably have to generate a report of skipped control words (which is why 
I'm not just sticking the ability in there).
