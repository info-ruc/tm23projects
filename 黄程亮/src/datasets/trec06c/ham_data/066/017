Hello.

I am a brazilian Computer Science student at UNISINOS 
University, and I am doing some research on Plan9 OS. I have 
already been at Plan9´s website and got a lot of pretty information, 
but I wonder were could I find more specific information about the 
Plan9 Kernel's structure, CPU scheduling and memory paging.

Another point is the security issue. How the OS implements 
security, in wich security level (D,C,B,A) it is classified, etc...

We (me and my group) would apreciate your help.

Guilherme Bedin.
