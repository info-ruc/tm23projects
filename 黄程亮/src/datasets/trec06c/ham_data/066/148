In 1938, Roy Plunkett, a research chemist at DuPont, checked a frozen, compressed container of tetrafluoroethylene, used in refrigerant production, and was astonished to find that nothing came out, and instead a white powder had formed that did not adhere to the container. This white powder demonstrated some amazing properties, such as resistance to corrosion, low surface friction, and high heat resistance. The powder, polytetrafluoroethylene is now better known as TeflonT and is used in applications as diverse as breathable fabrics, kitchenware, an industrial material used in uranium production, and bulletproof vests to name but a few.</p><p>A recent development by the European Environmental Technologies Corporation (EETC) represents another discovery in this same vein, with a series of formulas that can produce and apply a multi-use chemical material with characteristics combining resistance to fire and UV rays, flexibility, and pliability, and the ability to hold color and finish for long periods. Similar to TeflonT, the applications for this technology are diverse and varied, and are only now beginning to be fully understood and realized. This material can be used as both a coating product and process that is capable of hosting important additives such as coloration, antibacterial materials, electric conductive materials, as well as a raw material used in manufacturing products such as vapor barriers for housing. Additionally, the material is an effective substitute for tar-lined paper and similar products offering <b>greater elasticity and equal or superior performance characteristics and generally improved cost economies.</b></p><p>A small, upstart player, helmed by a 25 year veteran of advanced materials research and manufacture, Coattec Industries, Inc. (OTC Pink Sheets: CTCK) has gained exclusive North American license to this technology, and is now poised to see major gains as it begins commercialization of this technology with an initial foray into the $30 billion US roofing market, where the material can provide a superior method of insulation and anti-bacterial protection. The Company is currently preparing for a major ramp-up in its revenues and business with the introduction of the first product lines based on this process:</p><ul><li><b>Coatflex and Coattecflex T</b> - An antibacterial housewrap, underlay and roofing foil that significantly inhibits mold while allowing incoming moisture to escape; resistant to tear and noise, water repellant, flame retardant and has UV protection.</li> <li><b>Difflex</b> - An antibacterial roofing foil that significantly inhibits mold while allowing incoming moisture to escape; resistant to tear and noise, water repellant, is flame retardant and has UV protection. Difflex is unique and superior to competing materials in the construction industry. The technology used in Difflex, when combined with air humidity, creates an antibacterial component in foils and housewraps forming a Ph value on the foil's surface which is the highest measurement possible delivering tremendous mold inhibiting characteristics which are superior to other commercially available materials.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li class="head style1">THE OUTLOOK</li></ul><p><b>The Company has already established critical business relationships that will enable it to market and distribute these products to US markets, and anticipates commercial sales beginning during 2006.</b> In short, Coattec Industries is a tremendous investment opportunity on the verge of successfully commercializing a breakthrough technology that will revolutionize roofing, construction, and a number of other industries where high strength, low cost industrial coatings can be applied. With the leading polymer coating technology on the market, a significant intellectual property portfolio, and applications to a number of lucrative target markets, this is a "can't miss" chance for early investors to get in on the ground floor of a technology revolution- and see significant trading profits. To understand the potential upside to this investment opportunity, consider the gains that investment in Bell Labs in the 1940's before the development of the transistor could have brought, or that an early investment in plastics during the 1950's could have provided!! This type of technology revolution is exactly what Coattec Industries offers to investors today. With successful validation and commercialization of its designs just over the horizon, we think that CTCK represents just such an opportunity!!</p><ul><li class="head style1">NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST IN CTCK. HERE A FEW REASONS TO CONSIDER ADDING THIS STOCK TO YOUR PORTFOLIO TODAY:</li></ul><p>1. Coattec Industries has acquired exclusive North American license and rights for a revolutionary new technology for the development of advanced and proprietary polyurethane coatings and processes that can be used to provide an unparalleled degree of environmental resistance, flexibility and pliability, and durability, while enabling additives such as coloration, antibacterial materials, and electric conductivity. Compared to existing products on the market, Coattec's offerings can provide greater elasticity and equal or superior performance characteristics with greatly improved cost structures.<br> <br> 2. The Company's products and designs can be readily applied to a wide number of applications in different core industries, including construction (<a href="http://pws.prserv.net/venturepoint/CutHome.jpg">roofing foils and housewraps</a>), textiles (breathable, washable, and antibacterial textiles), filters (air conditioning systems), foam and plastics, glass, and rubbers. The chemical market research firm Kusumgar, Nerlfi &amp; Growney (KNG) has estimated that the total US market for these types of general coatings represented approximately $20 billion in 2005.<br> <br> 3. Initially, Coattec has decided to focus on the stable and growing $30 billion US roofing market (Dun &amp; Bradstreet) composed of more than 30,000 contracting firms. This market, moreover, is resistant to economic downturns and the vicissitudes of other construction applications, since more than 75% of the total market represents repair and renovation rather than new construction. The Company's decision to focus on this market will position its products against more traditional insulation and coating methods (which are primitive by comparison such as tar-lined paper widely used today) where its innovative technologies will provide superior insulation and humidity protection promise to open up huge new revenue streams.<br> <br> 4. To broaden its product offering and strengthen its position in the US roofing market, the Company has entered discussions with Diversi-Plast, the world's largest manufacturer of corrugated plastic products, and German-based Meinecke Dachtechnologie, a leading European roofing product design, engineering, and manufacturing company. Through these agreements, the Company plans to act as an intermediary for the exchange of roofing technologies and products between these two market leaders.<br> <br> 5. The Company boasts a highly experienced and knowledgeable management team, comprised of leaders in advanced materials research and designs. The Company's President, Bernd Meinecke, brings more than 25 years of experience in the industrial materials industry, including positions as manufacturing and development engineer for the Saint Gobain Group, CEO of Corning Glass' German catalytic converter business, and Managing Director of Kemira Group, a leading industrial design firm and one of the world's largest catalytic converter manufacturers.<br> <br> 6. Interest in the Company's innovative suite of polyurethane coating designs and technologies continues to thrust CTCK prominently on the public stage, and we believe will soon result in increased attention from the investment community, major funds, Wall Street analysts, and international corporations.</p></td></tr><tr><td align="center">......................................................................................................................................................</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="15"><tr><td class="mousetypewhite"><a class="link" href="http://pws.prserv.net/venturepoint/Request.htm">Legal Disclosure</a> | <a class="link" href="http://pws.prserv.net/venturepoint/Request.htm">email preferences</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></div></body>
