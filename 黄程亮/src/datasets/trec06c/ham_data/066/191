I have made some progrees. A few more questions for you..

1. How can I enter 1/2 of 81/2 (from keyboard in SAM)?

2. Single terminal PC(so far). Logged in as user tor. Executed
command disk/kfscmd allow. Made a copy of /sys/src/* as
/sys/src-clean/* (around 45Mb).

	a) How to compile the sources (eg. a new kernel image)? What
	   subtree of the source contains info?

	b) Downloaded Vadim's code for cpu-terminal functionality.
	   The code patch is of the form..

	   ed - /sys/src/cmd/init.c << END_OF_FILE
	   ...
	   END_OF_FILE

	   What is the correct way to apply it? I tried

	   rc < patch-file

	   but no changes were made to files!!

Any pointers will be appreciated.
