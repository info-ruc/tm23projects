Thanks for the tip.  I think you are right.  I got a NiMH catalogue from
Panasonic and it makes some of the same recommendation such as charge rate,
etc.  It is much like NiCD if you charge the battery "watching the clock".

I am planning on building a charger myself using the charger chip from
MAXIM.  The MAX712/MAX713 looks very easy to use.... :-p  It does all the
voltage drop detection and stuff...  If I get it to work, I'll let you know.
(or if you guys really don't care about such things????)
