Dear Sir,
  I am a new user of the handyboard. In a robot project of building a
manipulator, I have to drive for at least 3 servo motors. I have found the
routines for driving two servo motors at the same time from the handyboard info
website. But, if I need to drive for 3 motors at the same time. Can the
handyboard (without the expansion board) do this?
  Also, according to the servo routines, it says that it generates output
signals on Port A bit 7 and Port A bit 5. I don't know which pins on the
digital input pins are corresponding to these two?
  Thank you for your reply!
                                        Raymond Law
