I have made progress. I was intsalling from 1st edition CD, with 2nd
edition it does install correctly from CD. Now I want to get a better
GUI. The card in the PC is:

ATI 3D Charger IIC/4Mb RAM

card documentation says that it can do dotclock to 80MHz
ramdac is "3D Rage II" at 170Mhz

aux/vga finds a string at

0xC0085="ATI MACH64 BIOS P/N 113-40606-112"

link=vga
ctrl=mach64

if I use the above three lines in /lib/vgadb the screen goes blank and
stays blank.

Any pointers?
