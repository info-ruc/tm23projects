  aux/vga finds a string at
  0xC0085="ATI MACH64 BIOS P/N 113-40606-112"
  link=vga
  ctrl=mach64

Did you add those lines?  I don't see them
in the vgadb on the CD.  Adding support for
a new card usually consists of more than just adding
the entry to the database -- unfortunately all 
Mach 64s are not the same.  Sadly the card is
probably just not supported.
