Here are some more specific questions that I still have:

1) Can two handyboards communicate with each other from a distance?, either in
the same room (i.e. infrared) or via the internet?

2) Besides Interactive C, what exactly are the other ways that one can program
the handyboard?  has anyone created a more intuitive graphical interface?

3) Does the handyboard have a speaker that can play different frequencies like
the RCX (or can one be added as an output?) ?

4) Exactly how many sensors can be used at once with the handyboard w/o the
expansion board?  (I read 4 outputs, but couldn't find the number of sensors)

5) How fast can the handyboard acquire data? (RCX is 100-150Hz max)

6) How many different programs can be stored at once on the handyboard? (RCX:
5)

7) How many multiple tasks can be run on the handyboard at the same time?
(RCX: 12)

8) How many timers does the handyboard have? (RCX: 4)

9) Exactly how easy is it to attach LEGO or other components to the handyboard?

10) What is the size of the analog-digital conversion? (RCX: 10 bit)

p.s. dialup is really slow in china, so text answers are preferred to
downloading files or surfing sites!
