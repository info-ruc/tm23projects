As another novice DMDX user, I'll attempt to answer your question.
(Jonathan: I do expect you to speak up if I give any misinformation)

I don't use scrambling much, but I think that when 
you want to tell DMDX that a line is not to be scrambled,
you need to use a $ before and after the line.

Your example doesn't have a final $ at the end.
(you also might not need the < > )

Try this:

$
0 "Welcome to this experiment"
$


Just a note:  I tried to verify my advice by looking through the
DMDX help, keywords, etc., but couldn't easily find any documentation
for the proper usage of the $.  I expected to find it with the scramble
parameters.  (I actually found the answer from notes in my lab book 
from a meeting with an experienced Dmaster user in the spring of  '98.)

Good luck,
Jen
