I found two old video PCI cards.

1. Tseng Labs et4000/w32p chip based (1995). Works only in 640x480x1
mode, aux/vga shows at

0xC0076="Tseng Laboratories, Inc. 07/19/95 V8.00N"

2. ATI Mach32 chip based (1994). Works only in 640x480x1 mode, aux/vga
shows at

0xC0086="ATI MACH32 BIOS, PIN 113-23000-108"
0xC00D5="VGAWONDER+BK3"

First one seems to give better display. Is there any to make any of these
work in 1024x768x1 mode?
