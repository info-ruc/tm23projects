   Oh, I get it, it's a \langN, \lang followed by the hex number 
0xFE.  Still doesn't help I don't see 0xFE in the table.  Tell your 
assistant not to be specifying the language, ok?

   Not sure what to do with \langfe if it keeps cropping up (at least as 
far as the code is concerned), numeric parameters have to start with a 
numeric character in order for me to be able to determine that the control 
word has ended and I can go check it against known words (like \lanf0fe), 
correctly parsing \langfe would be a nightmare.
