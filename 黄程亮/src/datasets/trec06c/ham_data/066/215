Hi,

My sonar is working!, I checked the wires and noticed that when soldered
J12, I forget to cut the tail of the wire, maybe this was making contact
with other part of the HB, I have also noticed the limitation to measure
more than 2.6 m. , has anybody find a way to get more range?.

Also I have a dumb question, any time I start the Interactive C it load all
the libraries to the HB and I lost the program that was in memory, is that
normal?

And the last one, I have also the GP12, but Im not sure about what trace I
must cut, I have seen a picture in a link at this list, but in that, there
where 3 wires cutted and a wire bridge connected. Can I cut only the wire of
Analog0, to leave all the analogs in the exp board without the pullup? Any
problems with that?


Thank You, and sorry for making to much questions.


Jose Luis
