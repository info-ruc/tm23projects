Hi,

I keep receiving the following message in DMDX:
        Missing line number <$0 "Welcome to this experiment">

I have determined that the $ symbol is the culprit (when removed the file
runs just fine).  However, I can not find a $ symbol that DMDX will read.
I have tried a number of different fonts, I have re-typed the file, I have
copied $ symbols that I've written as .doc or in WordPad, and I continue to
receive the same message.  Does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks.
