         The error rates in a picture naming experiment are not very 
informative.  The only way an "error" can occur is if subject fails to 
respond or the VOX fails to trigger.

         DMDX gives you an idea of what the error rate is like after each 
trial in the experiment.  In a lexical decision experiment, an error means 
the subject pressed the wrong button, so the cumulative error rate tells 
you whether the subject is coping with the task.  If the subject makes an 
error on the very first trial, the error rate will be reported as 100% 
.  If the subject gets the next item right, the error rate will drop to 
50%, etc.

         So in a naming experiment, the error rate reported by DMDX simply 
tells you how often the VOX did not trigger, and it does not mean that the 
item should be discarded. The only error rates you need to be concerned 
about are the error rates when you analyze the results at the end of the 
experiment.
