Hi everyone,

I am now trying to use the IR transmitter and receiver to communicate two HB.
The method seems work, but the main problem is the transmitter power is seems
too weak. My HBs can only communicate within a few inches.
My question is:
Is there any method to increase the IR transmitter power using the same port?

Thanks,
Frankie Lai
