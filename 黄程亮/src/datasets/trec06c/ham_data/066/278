Hello. For one of my project in robotic, I would like to create a computer
simulation (possibly 3D) in order to show the special functions performed by
my robot. I would like this program to run under a windows (9x or NT) or
linux platform and run smootly on a PII 400MHz with 64MB of RAM. Any
suggestion(s) would be appreciated to accomplish such task.

Thank you,

J.-M. Mongeau
