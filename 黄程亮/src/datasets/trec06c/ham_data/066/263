Here's one I can answer, at least a little bit:  There's an HC11 port
to gcc-2.8.1 and a Handyboard library to go with it.  There's also a
GCC-2.9.5 version out there.

will get you to either one.  I program my Handyboard using Linux and
GCC instead of Interactive-C.  I'd only recommend it for the more
advanced users though.
