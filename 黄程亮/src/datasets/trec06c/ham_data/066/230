Dear All

I'm at my wits end on this one. It's a little routine to measure on PA0 =
a pulse width of a PWM signal generated on PA7. The two pins are linked =
with a jumper.

I've looked through all the books and and handyboard archive, but all I =
get is values that just don't seem to make sense.

Can anyone tell me where I'm going wrong.

TIA David young

void main()

{

int period=3D1500; /* High period for PWM signal on PA7 */

int TIC3 =3D 0x1014; /* TIC3 at $1014 and $1015 (connected to PA0) */

int TCTL2 =3D 0x1021; /* TCTL2 (input capture register) at $1021 */

int TFLG1 =3D 0x1023; /* TFLG1 (input capture flag register) at $1023 */

int rising_edge;

int falling_edge;

servo (period); /* PWM signal on PA7 - connected to PA0 by jumper */

servo_on ();



/* Detect a signal at PA0 on its rising edge -> set bit #0 to 1 and #1 =
to 0 */

bit_set(TCTL2,0);

bit_clear(TCTL2,1);

bit_set(TFLG1,0); /* Clear TFLG1 */

while (peek(TFLG1) & 0x01 !=3D 0x01){} /* Loop until the capture flag =
for PA0 is set*/

/* Get rising edge time in TIC3 */

rising_edge =3D peekword(TIC3);



/* Detect a signal at PA0 on its falling edge -> set bit #0 to 1 and #1 =
to 1 */

bit_clear(TCTL2,0);

bit_set(TCTL2,1);

bit_set(TFLG1,0); /* Clear TFLG1 */

while (peek(TFLG1) & 0x01 !=3D 0x01) {} /* Loop until the capture flag =
for PA0 is set*/

/* Get falling edge time in TIC3 */

falling_edge =3D peekword(TIC3);



printf("Pulse range =3D %d", rising_edge);=20

printf(" %d\n", falling_edge);=20

servo_off();

}
