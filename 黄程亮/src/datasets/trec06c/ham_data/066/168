I would be grateful if someone would tell ME what the license
for the next release is going to be.  One of the sticking points
at the moment is legal.  We're trying to do an open-source
release, but only time and lawyers will tell us if that's the way
it goes.  Please do not lobby us on the issue; it is beyond our
control, in the hands of corporate lawyers.
