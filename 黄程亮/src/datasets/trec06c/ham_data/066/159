Hi all,

I am running a picture naming experiment using the VOX, and I think it's
working fine.  (Thanks to all who got me to this point with DMDX!)

My question is:  what do the error rates mean?  Usually I see a 0% Error
Rate when there is an RT and a 100% error rate when there is a timeout
error, but I've also seen error rates of 3%, 5%, 6% etc and I don't know if
that means I should throw out those items.

Thank you.
