Does anyone have pictures of their sonar assembly online that I could look at,
just to make sure everything is where it should be? My sonar is still hovering
around one reading (today it's 1300, the other day it was 700) no matter where
an obstacle is. Putting a capcitor at the C7 position didn't seem to help.

Thx
