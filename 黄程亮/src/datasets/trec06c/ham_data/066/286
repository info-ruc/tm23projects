I found anther PCI graphics card based on S3 Trio64 chip.

The string is:

0xC0044="Phoenix S3 TRIO64 Enhanced VGA BIOS. PCI Version 1.1"

and when entered into /lib/vgadb in `ctrl' line for other TRIO64 cards as
ctlr
        0xC0045="Stealth 64 DRAM Vers. 2.02"                    # Diamond Stealt
	0xC0045="Stealth 64 DRAM Vers. 1.14"
	0xC0045="Stealth SE DRAM Vers. 1.01"                    # Diamond Stealt
	0xC0044="Phoenix S3 TRIO32 Enhanced VGA BIOS. Version 1.3-08-12-57MHz"
	0xC0044="Phoenix S3 TRIO64 Enhanced VGA BIOS. Version 1.3-08"
	0xC0044="Phoenix S3 TRIO64 Enhanced VGA BIOS. Version 1.00-06"
	0xC0044="Phoenix S3 TRIO64 Enhanced VGA BIOS. Version 1.2-07"
	0xC0044="Stealth64 Video 2001"                          # Trio64V+
	link=vga
	hwgc=s3hwgc
	ctlr=trio64 link=ibm8514

seem to be recognized. When I try (monitor is set to multosync65)

aux/vga -l 800x6000x1 (or 1024x768x1)

the enhanced screen stays visible (pointer scales down) but the mouse
buttons produce no effect (no menus).. looks like it did not work..

How do I mount an ATAPI CDROM (after installing the CD)?

Any ideas?
