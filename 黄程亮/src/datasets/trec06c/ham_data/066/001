Subject: Java 1.2.2 - Unable to connect to MS Access/MS Visual Foxpro data sources 
Date: Wed, 12 Apr 2000 23:41:35 EDT
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi,
  Please help!!!! I need to connect to MS Access database and Visual Foxpro 
database through JAVA 1.2.2 from Sun and display my data.
I have the following setup:
JDK1.2.2 Standard edition from Sun, MS ACCESS and MS Visual Foxpro Databases 
setup as SYSTEM datasources through Control Panel.
Windows NT platform.
I keep getting my error message "Unable to connect"
Also I am new to this, which is the best way to make the connection as far 
as the speed and application performance goes - JdbcOdbc bridge or any 
other?

Any help will be greatly appreciated.

//Here is the code


import java.sql.*
public class test1 {
  public static void main(string args[]){
try {
      Class.forname("sun.jdbc.odbc.JDBCOdbcDriver")
      string url = "jdbc:Odbc:myaccessdb";
      Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url);
    } catch (SQLExecption e) {
                              System.out.println("Unable to connect!")
			     }
   }
}
