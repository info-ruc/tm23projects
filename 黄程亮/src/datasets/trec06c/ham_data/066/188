You are entirely right.  Sufficiently high management can make the
lawyers do anything they want.  Unfortunately, noone above the lower levels of
research really cares one way or the other what happens to Plan 9.  The
lawyers, without pressure or coverage from someone with influence in
the company, have a tendency to cover their own backsides.  It's
their genitals on the chopping block should they let out something that
is later perceived as representing a major revenue loss for the company.

It's our job to convince the higher ups and the lawyers that releasing
plan 9 as free open source is in the company's best interest.  This time
around, Rob has spent the last six months lobbying up the management hierarchy and
pushing on the lawyers.  Other research management has been doing the
same for other projects.  It seems to be having results.  Please don't
flog a very tired horse.  The hill is steep and the cart heavy.
