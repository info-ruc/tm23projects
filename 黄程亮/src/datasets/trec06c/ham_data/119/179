Hi,
I?m trying to configure timedx in order to run a priming exp with videos
as primes. When I select the audio I obtain two options: 0 primary audio
1 sound blaster 16. 
I?ve tried to select in turn one or the other but when I run the audio (or
digital video) tests timedx crashes and I don?t know why. The sound device
on the computer is creative sound blaster 16 plug and play wdm and I saw
on the help that the sound blaster 16 is good for dmdx. 
I don?t need sound for my videos, however I can?t have the exp running in
dmdx if I?ve no audio correctly configured. What could I do? (I have never
had this problem on other computers)

Thanks a lot

Annalisa
