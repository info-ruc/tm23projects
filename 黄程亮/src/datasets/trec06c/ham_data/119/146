Eli and Guy:
"the bartender speaketh" with 'ceterum censeo':
why do we still restrict our views and explanations to
specific models we find essential in our reduction of
the broader picture? Guy with his 2 majors seems to
include wider connotations, but I still feel an either
or in his consideration - even if he combines them.

I caused a good laugh at an evolutionary conference a
decade or two ago (Drew Univ. NJ-USA, - a religiously
undertoned openminded college) when I remarked that
the criteria for fitness (for better proliferation) in
our ongoing human species include MONEY, explained as:

"the guy with the LAMBORGHINI gets the better girl".
Biologically and genetically.
