The first paper, "The EigenTrust Algorithm for Reputation Management
in P2P Network," presents a decentralized reputation system on top of
peer-to-peer network. Each node calculates the local trust values for
other peers based on the transaction with the peers. Then, node
normalizes the local trust values and aggregates the local trust
values from other peers to form the global trust values. The main idea
is based on the notion of transitive trust. A peer will usually trust
the opinions of those peers who have authentic files. Using this idea,
global trust values can be computed using eigenvector of a matrix of
normalized local trust values in a distributed manner. However,
EigenTrust requires some pre-trusted peers to guarantee convergence
and break up malicious nodes, which is a drawback of the system.

The second paper, "A Robust Reputation System for P2P and Mobile
Ad-hoc Networks," use a modified Bayesian approach to compute
reputation rating of others. The main idea is to maintain two rating
for every node. The reputation rating represents is the rating of
whether the nodes behave correctly or not. And the trust rating
represents how trustworthy are the nodes. Also, it keeps track of the
rating of the first hand information. For each transaction, the node
will update the first hand information and the reputation rating. And
it periodically publishes the first hand information to a subset of
nodes. If the node is trustworthy or the published first hand
information is close to its own reputation rating, then it will update
the reputation rating using modified Bayesian approach, and the trust
rating.
