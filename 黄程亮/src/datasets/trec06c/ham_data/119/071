<p>You can see China&#146;s developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare opportunity 
  for early investors!<BR><BR>Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (<font size="4"><b>C</b></font><font color="#CCCC8s">s</font><b><font size="4">G</font></b><font color="#CCCC8f">x</font><b><font size="4">D</font></b><font color="#CCCCob">5</font><b><font size="4">C</font></b><font color="#CCCC8t">e</font>)? 
  See nowadays what happened:<BR><BR>&#149; Rising gold prices are further accelerating 
  this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and 
  this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted 
  for inflation.)</p>
<p>&#149; HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been 
  estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.</p>
<p>&#149; China is the world&#146;s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked 
  away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China&#146;s 
  rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.</p>
<p>&#149; China is already the world&#146;s 4th largest producer of gold &#151; 
  and will soon be the world&#146;s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is 
  going gold-crazy!</p>
<p>&#149; Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed 
  to provide full legal protection.<BR><BR>CURRENT NEWS: China Gold Corp. Announces

You never know what you can do until you try  Fools rush in where angels fear to tread. A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels. Distance makes the heart grow fonder Hatred stirs up dissension, but love covers over all wrongs When Mumma dead family done. 
  A Good Example is the Best Sermon. A watched pot never boils. Smooth seas do not make skillful sailors Football is a game of two halves Kill not the goose that lays the golden egg Yuh can't fatten cow fuh another man butcher.	 Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground  One, one dutty build dam. Let bygones be bygones What goes up must come down A lender nor borrower be.  
  Slow fire ah boil hard cow-heel. Everything must have a beginning You are a long time dead He knows best what good is that has endured evil  The road to hell is paved with good intentions It is nice to be important but it is more important to be nice April is the cruellest month Pentium wise; pen and paper foolish. Never the twain shall meet  You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar He who makes no mistakes, makes nothing
