Dear Colleagues,

UCEA meet -- but not with us:

Due to the unions action, the employers were forced to the table today.
Despite barring the academic unions, AUT and Natfhe, from this afternoon's
pay talks, the employers' representatives, the Universities and Colleges
Employers' Association (UCEA), decided to go ahead with the 'negotiations'
and made an 'offer' which amounts to little more than a publicity stunt.

What is the offer?
  * The pay offer is just 6% over two years.

An average of 3% a year is the 'serious' offer that the employers have
trailed for a month. UCEA must think again and seriously address the AUT's
claim.

Go here for the AUT Press release:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1598

We will provide a more detailed response to LA's tomorrow morning.

Sally Hunt

General Secretary

AUT
