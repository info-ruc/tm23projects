Thanks for the considerate reply, Eli, I did not
realize so far how an exceptional and unique person I
was. Some remarks though:

Would you call such 'possibilities' as one's own and
unfounded 'creation' of onesself? I consider them as a
combination of 'precedent' affects on the outcome.

Oho! you substitute the unlimited ('wider' infinite)
image of the totality (wholeness) for a primitive
human gaming artifact of recent? Simulacrons and
metaphors are wrong, even if they don't simplify a
complex into some chosen primitive substitutions - for
the sake of a good argument. Applied to JM's
diversity.

Thank you. So it is not a scimpy deck of cards.

Here we get to somewhere. Implied is the notion that
WE (humanity's best thinkers involved) assume to
understand and 'compute' the totality. We should not
pass judgement on the potentials and variations of the
wholeness, before we CAN think in ALL of it. 
You wrote the proper expression: "conceivable". Think
in infinite digitality analog computers, qualia
unlimited and beyond our imagination, infinite
variables and unlimited (unthought of) effects. That
is what 'the old man' of Einstein used as his dye. 
That 'this' is not 'science - as we know it'? Right.
It may be 'speculation' beyond the reductionist
science where we arrived at so far over the short
infancy of our human (thinking) evolution. 6-8
millennia? and we still think only by using our
restricted tissues - with metaphors of the present
embryonic state of computing.

Choice of partial evidence. Conceivable and restricted
to our 2006 thinking. I have no argument agains that.
