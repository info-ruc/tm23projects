Subject: departmental email filtered by yahoo



Our departmental email is being filtered by yahoo and sent automatically
to the bulk folder (for all yahoo users-I tested 5 different accounts).
I checked and our server is not listed with any black list. I tried to
open a couple of cases with yahoo to try to find the source of the
problem but their technical support only sent me information in a
template about how to add new addresses to the my personal blacklist
(which I didn't ask for..).  I also called a number that I found online
for yahoo mail support but they couldn't help either (they only worked
with login problems and/or other trivial problems).  Does anyone have
any reliable contact information for Yahoo?



Thanks

Jose Bernier
