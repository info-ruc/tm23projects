Hi all

A few people have asked for information about the UNISON / Amicus strike.

If you want to express solidarity by not crossing a picket line, you can always work from home, or if you have to come in, make a picketer a cup of tea.  One of the lecturers from Bath Spa brought us some chocolate on the day of the AUT strike, and it was very welcome!

Information about the strike here:  http://www.unison.org.uk/pensions/why.asp
(I can't find the equivalent info on the Amicus site, but if you want to look for it, the URL is http://www.amicustheunion.org/ )

Regards

Yvonne
