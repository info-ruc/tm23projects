On our standard University setup here, permission to write to C: drive
and registry is denied to 'normal' users and we have to get an
administrator to make minor changes before DMDX will run properly.
Your setup may be the same so e.g. the TimeDX values may not be saving.
Our cure is:

1. registry edit HKLM/SOFTWARE/DMDX to allow all users to modify
2. registry edit HKLM/SOFTWARE/TIMEDX also to allow all users to modify
3. security change on folder C:\Program Files\DMDX to allow all users to
modify

I suspect you will need to make the same sort of changes if your
security is like ours..

//I am having problems running an experiment on lexical priming 
//in LSM. I do all the tasks in TimeDX and when I try to check 
//the syntax it says:
// 
//Couldn't not 
//Creat/OpenRegistryKey<SOFTWARE>/DMDX/3/LastUsedItemFile>ErrorCode5
// 
//Once I close that window  appears another once that says the 
//same but now on top iof that it says:
// 
//TUne some values for anticipating the vertical retrace.
// 
//I believe that I have already tuned all the paramters up. My 
//video clips are 640x480 32bits, the programme says that, my 
//tuning parameters have been set that way, but all the same 
//the window says that i have to tune it up.
// 
//I had a similar problem and Deb showed me how to fix the 
//problem in my lap top. But now that I need to set the 
//programme in the lab's computers (Dell) I am getting this 
//messages. Does it have anything to do with any kind of 
//restrictions that this computers might have for being part of 
//the university's network?
