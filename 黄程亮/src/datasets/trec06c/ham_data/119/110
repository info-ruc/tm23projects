               to          CX-Sci                    from   Lewis L Smith

Jerry has raised an important point which I have not seen considered 
elsewhere.

All systems operate within an "evironment" composed of ecologies and other 
systems, an interact with them, but some systems have significant power to shape 
both those ecologies and the behavior of the other systems.   This really is 
power writ large !

Cordially.   End of message.
