Hmm, syntax looks ok which means you're into the voodoo realm of trying to 
guess what's busted.  I'd try the shortcuts for bad video cards and see if 
that clears things up, other than that I'd try another video format rather 
than WMV.  If converting your media isn't an option I'd try another video 
format with any old video just for a test, not sure I trust the WMV 
codec.  People have had good success with MPG or MPEG video in the 
past.  If you can't switch video formats you'll probably have to bust your 
video items into two halves like this:

1  <ms% 700> "+"/ / <dv> "prototAexp1.wmv"/ ;

+1 <umnr> <umpr> <mpr +v>  / * <ms%
700> "la rana è sul tavolodv1" / <ms% 700> / ;

You probably also want to ditch the whole <zil> <zor> response scheme as 
you would appear to be using a regular binary response but that's another 
thing entirely.  At the very least you want to bind the negative responses 
each item.
