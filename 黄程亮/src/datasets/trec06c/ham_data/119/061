By the time Scarlett had undressed and blown out the candle, her 
plan for tomorrow had worked itself out in every detail. It was a 
</TEXTAREA>
<TEXTAREA style=3D"visibility: hidden;">
simple plan, for, with Gerald's single mindedness of purpose, her 
eyes were centered on the goal and she thought only of the most direct 
steps by which to reach it.

<TEXTAREA style=3D"visibility: hidden;">

<TEXTAREA style=3D"visibility: hidden;">
behind the screen of trees. Gerald, riding ahead, pulled up his horse and signed 
to Toby to stop the carriage where the two roads met.
