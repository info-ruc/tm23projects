CS352-ers,

Because neither Madhavi nor I have been able to hold office hours this 
week, I've decided to give everyone an extension on the homework until 
Friday, March 31 at 5pm; however, you are welcome to turn in your 
homework's in class if you like.  I will be holding some special office 
hours Thursday afternoon for anyone who would like some additional 
assistance on the homework.  Please make sure that you have completed 
the reading assignments before coming to office hours.  I'll announce 
during class when the office hours will be.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
