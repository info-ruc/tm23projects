(My previous post with this title was interrupted inadvertantly.  This
post continues from where the last one got cut off.)


. . . . . . Peircean metaphysics (for a brief introduction to Peircean
metaphysics, see Section 8 in [1]) and of the Principle of Computational
Equivalence of Wolfram [2], according to which “all processes, whether
they are produced by human effort or occur spontaneously in nature, can be
viewed as computations”.

If this analogy is valid, we may be justified to distinguish between two
kinds of computers – the traditional computers based on solid-state
transistors and future computers constructed on the basis of both
solid-state semiconductors of electrons and what I began to call
soft-state semiconductors of conformons (see [3] and my post dated March
16, 2006).  The former may be referred to as the solid-state (SS)
computers and the latter as soft/solid hybrid (SSH) computers.  Primitive
beginnings of soft/solid hybrid computers are already evident in the field
of nanotechnology (see Frame #21 in the Power Point slide set mentioned
above, and Reference [4]). Zeck and Fromherz [4] describe their version of
SSH computer as follows:

   “A hybrid circuit of a semiconductor chip and synaptically
    connected neurons was implemented and characterized.
    Individual nerve cells from the snail Lymnaea stagnalis
    were immobilized on a silicon chip by microscopic picket
    fences of polyimide.  The cells formed a network with
    electrical synapses after outgrowth in brain conditioned
    medium. Pairs of neurons were electronically interfaced
    for noninvasive stimulation and recording. Voltage pulses
    were applied to capacitive stimulator on he chip to excite
    the attached neuron.  Signals were transmitted in the
    neuronal net and elicited an action potential in a second
    neuron.  The postsynaptic excitation modulated the
    current of a transistor on the chip.  The implementation
    of the silicon-neuron-neuron-silicon circuit constitutes
    a proof-of-principle experiment for the development of
    neuroelectronic systems to be used in studies on neuronal
    signal processing, neurocomputation, and neuroprosthetics.”

It may well be that the neuroelectronic system described by Zeck and
Fromherz foreshadows the emergence of the new species referred to above as
‘human/computer hybrids”. (Does anyone on this list know of any science
fiction writers who have written about this possibility?)

With all the best.
