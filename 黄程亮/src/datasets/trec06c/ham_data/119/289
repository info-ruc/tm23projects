   Thanks for your response. A couple of remarks. I guess I agree with
John McCrone on the first point, that although there is an algorithm for
computing the digits of pi, the calculation can go on forever. So it's a
matter of deciding whether one wants to accept the formal definition of
a computable number like pi, or qualify computability with certain
practical/real world considerations.=20

   On the second point, although there may be *some* 'well-defined'
uncomputable numbers, most, in fact an infinite number cannot be
well-defined because there are at most a countably infinite number of
definitions (and most of those definitions would be questionable as to
whether the numbers they describe should be considered well-defined when
their character lengths grow to, say, the number of atoms in the
universe). My only issue with your original posting was that the way it
was stated implied that *any* uncomputable number is well defined.

Regards,
Frank

Yes. In fact the algorithm can be considered a finite representation
of the number.

Yes. The original example of an uncomputable, but well defined number
is \Omega, which is the proportion of input strings on which a given
universal Turing machine halts. This is clearly a well defined number
that lies between 0 and 1. Since there is no general algorithm to
determine if a UTM halts on a given string, there is no algorithm that
can compute its digits (the first few digits can be estimated by
statistical means, of course).

Through a variant of Cantor's diagonalisation argument, it is possible
to show that there are only countably many computable numbers, so the
uncomputable numbers far outnumber the computable ones.

Wikipedia has nice intros to these concepts.
