Eli (and Guy?):

My first question to both of you: what should be
considered "engaging in social construction"? 
Stones will not form political parties as we know
those and them. Galaxies may exhibit 'constructs'
(behavioral?) which may fit an appropriately
formulated  definition of social (interactive?).
A forest vs many trees can be called a soc. constr. 
because of the biocomplex interwovenness between
plants, insects, animals, the living ambiance, etc. 
Probably not consciously (purposefully?) as we know
that one from our human restrictions. Maybe in another
sense....????
Another even farther remote example could be the
chemical 'life' of a volcano-inside working itself to
eruption or not. Or the deep sea community (I prefer
to look at the chemistry of changes, to concentrate on
the non-bio aspect, which in turn, would come up in
the interacting life of deepsea creatures). Are any
'sociological' aspects detectable in such ambiances?
Bio, or not? In our term of purposefulness, or not?

Now the hard part: Eli, before you generated that
dilemma you wrote about, I would have considered my
stance whether I agree with a hierarchy surrounding
(!) (up or down) biology and sociology for that
matter. 
I am looking at these things in a wider horizon:
both (and many others as well) are influenced -
whether hierarchically or just anecdotally -  by many
other factors. I am reluctant to use here the
wholeness argument. So I may not pick these TWO to
decide which one is the hierarchical boss of the
other. 
They are interwoven, OK, in more ways than we usually
(can) consider. 

Thank you guys for giving us these ideas of yours. It
was a pleasure to think into them.
