Dear friend, 

Sorry for intruding into your privacy, I am a 65 years old man and a British =
citizen currently living in Kuwait.

I am an Oil merchant and owned Oil businesses in Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi =
Arabia. I was married with two children and my wife and two children died in =
a car accident six years ago. 
Two years ago I was diagnosed with prostrate cancer and this week my doctors =
have just informed me that i have few months to live. 

Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I lived =
for. I never really cared about other values in life. 

But since the loss of my family and after i was dianosed with prostrate =
cancer, i have found a new desire to assist helpless families. I have been =
helping charity organisations by donating money to them to assist the less =
priviledge in Asia and other parts of the world.

Before I became ill, I kept some money, three and a half million dollars =
($3.5million) to be precise in a long term deposit account in a private =
finance institution in europe. 

Presently, I am in a hospital and my doctor says i have few months to live, =
and it is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity =
organizations.

Because so much of my wealth has been plundered by relatives and friends =
since my illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge =
responsibility to any of them.

I want you to assist me collect the funds from the finance company in europe =
and distribute it amongst charity organizations. Use your judgment to =
distribute the money and keep 10% 
of it to yourself. Feel free to reimburse yourself when you have the money =
for any cost you incur during the process of collecting and distributing the =
money to charity organizations.

May you be blessed for your good deed.

I await your urgent response. 

Best regards,

Albert
