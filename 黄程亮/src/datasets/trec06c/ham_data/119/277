All our conferences are non-profit. They bring together the elite of the
world science; so far, we have had seven Nobel Laureates speaking at the
opening ceremonies. The conferences always take place in some of the
most attractive places of the world. All those who come to our
conferences once, always love to come back (because of the unique
professional quality and the extremely creative atmosphere); lists of
past participants are on the web, as well as the details of all future
conferences.

These conferences are in line with the newest recommendations of the US
National Science Foundation and of the EU research sponsoring agencies, to
stress multidisciplinary, interdisciplinary, and transdisciplinary
research (M+I+T++ research). The speakers and activities at our
conferences truly support this type of scientific interaction.
