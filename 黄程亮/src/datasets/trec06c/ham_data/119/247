Hi Everyone

Can someone please let me know more about the symptoms of this syndrome.
I have had MG since 2003 - general and bad Ocular.  The reason for my
question is that I was told to stop my Prednisone in January I was only
taking 30mg daily but I had been taking it for about 2 and a half years.
I have been off Prednisone for about 6 weeks but none of my other
medication has changed ie. Mestinon 30mg every three hrs 4 times per day
and Methotrixate once a week. =0D

At night my legs cramp and I can hardly sleep - mainly the lower part
thereof.  During the day all my muscles are stiff and sore as if I had
been doing heavy exercise a day or two before.  When I get out of bed I
have to walk very slowly it is as if my joints and muscles need to wake
up/warm up and then the pain lets up a bit but I have this stiffness and
soreness throughout the day - It is painful to climb stairs, to walk and
to get up from where I have been sitting - I have a desk job - full day.
It is painful to get out of my car when I have been driving for a short
or long distance.

When I say painful I mean stiff and sore.

My Neuro says MG is not painful - I am going to see her on Friday next
week and then we will discuss the above but I was wondering if anyone
can help with info in the meantime.

PS.  I am 48 years old and I do not do any exercise other than walk
around the shops now and again and climb about 20 stairs up and down
about 7 to 8 times a day.

Regards
Diann Johnson
South Africa
