                  Staying Safe on Social Network Sites

   The popularity of social networking sites continues to increase,
   especially among teenagers and young adults. The nature of these sites
   introduces security risks, so you should take certain precautions.

What are social networking sites?

   Social networking sites, sometimes referred to as "friend-of-a-friend"
   sites, build upon the concept of traditional social networks where you
   are  connected  to  new  people  through  people you already know. The
   purpose  of some networking sites may be purely social, allowing users
   to  establish  friendships or romantic relationships, while others may
   focus on establishing business connections.

   Although  the  features  of  social  networking sites differ, they all
   allow you to provide information about yourself and offer some type of
   communication mechanism (forums, chat rooms, email, instant messenger)
   that  enables  you to connect with other users. On some sites, you can
   browse for people based on certain criteria, while other sites require
   that you be "introduced" to new people through a connection you share.
   Many of the sites have communities or subgroups that may be based on a
   particular interest.

What security implications do these sites present?

   Social networking sites rely on connections and communication, so they
   encourage  you  to  provide  a certain amount of personal information.
   When  deciding how much information to reveal, people may not exercise
   the  same  amount  of  caution  as  they would when meeting someone in
   person because
     * the internet provides a sense of anonymity
     * the  lack  of  physical  interaction  provides  a  false  sense of
       security
     * they  tailor the information for their friends to read, forgetting
       that others may see it
     * they  want  to  offer  insights  to  impress  potential friends or
       associates

   While  the  majority of people using these sites do not pose a threat,
   malicious people may be drawn to them because of the accessibility and
   amount of personal information available on them. The more information
   malicious  people  have  about  you, the easier it is for them to take
   advantage  of  you.  Predators  may form relationships online and then
   convince  unsuspecting  individuals to meet them in person. That could
   lead  to  a  dangerous situation. The personal information can also be
   used  to  conduct  a  social  engineering  attack (see Avoiding Social
   Engineering   and   Phishing  Attacks  for  more  information).  Using
   information  that you provide about your location, hobbies, interests,
   and  friends, a malicious person could impersonate a trusted friend or
   convince  you that they have the authority to access other personal or
   financial data.

How can you protect yourself?

     * Limit  the  amount  of personal information you post - Do not post
       information  that  would  make you vulnerable (e.g., your address,
       information  about  your schedule or routine). If your connections
       post  information about you, make sure the combined information is
       not more than you would be comfortable with strangers knowing.
     * Remember  that  the  internet  is  a  public  resource - Only post
       information  you are comfortable with anyone seeing. This includes
       information  in  your profile and in blogs and other forums. Also,
       once  you  post  information online, you can't retract it. Even if
       you  remove  the information from a site, saved or cached versions
       may  still  exist  on  other people's machines (see Guidelines for
       Publishing Information Online for more information).
     * Be  wary  of  strangers - The internet makes it easy for people to
       misrepresent  their  identities  and  motives  (see  Using Instant
       Messaging  and  Chat  Rooms Safely for more information). Consider
       limiting the people who are allowed to contact you on these sites.
       If you interact with people you do not know, be cautious about the
       amount  of  information  you  reveal  or  agreeing to meet them in
       person.
     * Be  skeptical  -  Don't believe everything you read online. People
       may  post  false  or  misleading information about various topics,
       including  their own identities. This is not necessarily done with
       malicious   intent;  it  could  be  unintentional,  a  product  of
       exaggeration,  or  a  joke. Take appropriate precautions, thought,
       and try to verify the authenticity of any information before taken
       any action.
     * Check  privacy policies - Some sites may share information such as
       email addresses or user preferences with other companies. This may
       lead   to  an  increase  in  spam  (see  Reducing  Spam  for  more
       information).   Also,  try  to  locate  the  policy  for  handling
       referrals  to  make sure that you do not unintentionally sign your
       friends  up  for  spam.  Some  sites  will  continue to send email
       messages to anyone you refer until they join.

   Children  are  especially  susceptible  to  the  threats  that  social
   networking  sites  present.  Although  many  of  these  sites have age
   restrictions,  children  may  misrepresent their ages so that they can
   join. By teaching children about internet safety, being aware of their
   online habits, and guiding them to appropriate sites, parents can make
   sure  that the children become safe and responsible users (see Keeping
   Children Safe Online for more information).
