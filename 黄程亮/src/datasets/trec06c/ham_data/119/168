  Dear Friend, 
   
  Please pardon me if you are offended upon receiving this proposal since we have no formal contact. 
  My name is JOHNSON GILBERT .  and I was the Personal assistance to of the late Gnassigngbe Eyadema, former president of Togo who passed away after a brief illness few months ago. During my service to him and my country I was loyal and I went on almost every foreign trip he made to deposit or invest Money outside Togo. 
   
  Shortly before his death in the first week of February we made a trip to Switzerland on the last week of January and on our way we stopped in France where we deposited a cash of US$9.7 million dollars. Fortunately for me this is one of the very few trips I made without the company of his 3rd son Faure Gnassingbe the then interior Minister, now President of Togo. 
   
  I will like you to go to France or any of the countries in Europe nearest to you where the institution in custody of the fund has an office and collect this fund either in cash or in check and pay into your account. Where I sincerely believe it will be safe with you until I am able to be with you in your country where I intent to settle down and invest. I am willing to share it 70% for me and 30% for you if you will be Honest with me. 
   
  I pray you to take this up immediately. Once you respond to the affirmative I will go ahead and prepare the necessary documentation for you to claim the fund and deposit it in your account. You have nothing to worry about because the original documents of this fund are with me so it will be easy for you to acquire the fund. 
  Please reply on my email address below as a matter of confidentiality:gilbert_j01@yahoo.com

  I await your positive response soonest. 
   
  JOHNSON GILBERT
