Jerry - and other contributors in this thread:

first thanks to Lewis for a lot of information which
may have been looking differently from C-Europe at the
time when they were in progress. 

Also Stan's idea seems valid, I want to concentrate
here to Jerry's words (I mean: words).

First I completely AGREE with his last line. 

Call the present arrangement 'fascism', because it
looks like one? not a good idea, a strongly burnt and
defeated (sort of) NAME is not 'flaggable'. 

We MAY MISS the difference between (small) investors
and big owners who control the boards. I would not
volunteer to evaluate the happenings (Enron etc.): too
much human vileness mixes together. Nafte was IMO a
misconstrued political (-ly correct) slogan, and I
refer to the elusiveness of "free" what we read below.
Free is always very expensive. 

 Politicians just CANNOT pursue any right idea,
because they have to support the re-election of
cronies/yeomen and the interest of their oowners. 

There is a dichotomy between countries as they are
called (example: Mexico) and the clique that owns it. 
And the government, quite similarly to medieval King
in Euiropian feudalism, is "Primus inter pares", 
the agreed upon representative of the ruling/owning
segment. The 'econo-lords' today.

(To Lewis' par about the Magna Charta: it was the
era's development in European life: as I recall,
(can't put my finger on it, sorry) there was some
constitution ~1210 in Sicily, a "Golden Bulla" of a
strong constitution in 1222 in Hungary, and movements
in other countries as well. It was the growing
importance of cities vs the overwhelmingly earlier
agriculture-based post-Roman Empire turmoil. Beginning
of the European (complex) Renaissance. - 
Concluding in the action of the "4th state" havenots
in the French revolution. 
I do not see another option to improve upon the
present e-feudal development either. It is early, but:
Calling Dr. Guillotine...
 Regards to all involved
JM
