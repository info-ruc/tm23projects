Yeah, up until 03/30/05 when DMDX 3.1.2.6 was released that was the case 
but I'm fairly sure that since then DMDX runs in limited access 
environments.  The exception might be where DMDX was setup before the 
limits were imposed where it will be able to see keys of it's that it can 
no longer write to.  In which case deleting the keys you refer to should 
fix things.  Current versions of DMDX when they see they cannot access the 
HKLM registry keys fail over to use the HKLU tree of the registry which it 
should be able to write to under even the most Draconian setup.
