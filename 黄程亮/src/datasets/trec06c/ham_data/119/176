Hold onto your hat, Hannah,

The survey is designed to let only person enter a survey from one  
location to avoid stuffing the ballot box so to speak.  I can turn  
this feature off and allow multiple entries from one computer.  I  
believe this is the source of your ebola.  Let me know if you still  
have trouble entering data.
