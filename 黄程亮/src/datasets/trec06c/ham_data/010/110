I recently attempted a download of code from IC-3.1 to a Handy Board,
including some large arrays and other global variables. I then got
an error message that there was an apparent conflict because I
had used too much space. While I cleaned things up, I am interested
in knowing if there is anything written down about space utilization
and management within the HB or by IC. I also am a bit perplexed by
almost 8Kbytes of "interrupts" loaded by IC???? That's a lot of
"interrupts!"			Dave Thompson
