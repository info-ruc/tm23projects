I recently downloaded the pa7_9600 software that would allow me to use
pa7 as a ttl level serial port at 9600 baud. My question is, where is pa7
brought out? The schematics and parts layout drawings have only confused
me.&nbsp; The crude drawing below is where I think it might be, please
help me out, my robot is anxious to walk!
