You seem to be running pine under Solaris.  This mean you must be using
some sort of telnet session to your Sun box to run pine.  If this is the
case then the data file (picture) resides on the Sun box...but the
application to render the picture is on your PC.  So, one method, is to 
save the picture to the disk on the Sun and then transfer it to the PC
and run the application to render it.  

Without knowing your HW/SW setup it is difficult to advise an exact method
to accomplish the task.  Maybe your "helpdesk" could be of assistance?
