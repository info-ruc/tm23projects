I wanted to know if there was a way to copy text from Pine and paste it
in a text editor and save it as a text file automatically on a Win95
platform. When I say automatically, i mean there is no user interaction,
only a program which copies and pastes automatically at given time
intervals. 

any info would be appreciated, thank you.
