You have been told repeatedly that the pine-info mailing list is for discussion
of the pine executable, a user agent for Internet mail. You cannot ask for
information on seeking jobs in Canada through this mailing list! You didn't
send your reply to Robin, but to the list.

If your system administrator has set up pine for news reading, yes, you can
read can.jobs. Look at the folder list ("l" from the main menu) and hit "?" for
help. Read about folder collections as you need to create a news collection.

Then, go to your configuration file (s, then c, from the main menu) and read
the help "?" for folder collections and news collections. You must be able to
read news via NNTP or IMAP. If you need further help, ask your system
administrator. We can't tell you what your news server is!
