To whom it may concern,
	I was wondering how to make a picture appear on my pc when my
brother scans a picture and sends it. When I get the e-mail I can read the
message but the system will not allow me to view the attached picture
that has been scanned and sent. If you could please tell me what I am
doing wrong or if it can be done it would be appreciated. Thank you for
your time.


						Sincerely,
						Kevin Mcgrogan
