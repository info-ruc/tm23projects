If the sensor headers look like this:

live signal [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [X]

+5v         [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
ground      [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [X]
sensor#      15  14  13  12  11  10  9   8   7      6   5   4   3   2   1   0

Then for sensor 0, you use the header pins marked as [X].

If you are sure you have a 10K resistor, and you are using the correct
pins, and you are getting a reading of 5 or 6 (not 40), then this
suggests that the resistor pack value is wrong.  You should have a 47K
resistor pack.  If a 10K resistor yields a value of 5 or 6, you might
have a 470K resistor pack soldered down between the +5v and signal
rows.

re: DL, thanks for your observations.  I'll take note of it.
