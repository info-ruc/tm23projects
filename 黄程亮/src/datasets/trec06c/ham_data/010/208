Hi All,=20
 I have just ordered a Handyboard and while i'm lerning IC i was =
wondering if the programs from the book Mobile Robots will work with the =
handyboard, my robot is configured similar to Rugwarrior,i.e. three bump =
an two IR proximity detector,shaft encoders, two photocell an a =
microphone.
If the Mobile Robot programs won't run on the handyboard can someone =
tell me where i could find a similar compatable program so my robot =
doen't have to wait for me to smarten up to get mobile.
Also, which ports on the handyboard do these sensor connect to?.
Any help would be appreciated as i'm very new to microcontrollers and C =
language.
Thanks,
Clancy
