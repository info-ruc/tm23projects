Several times in email msgs I have received the following:

[The following text is in the "iso-8859-1" character set]
[Your display is set for the "US-ASCII" character set]
[Some characters may be displayed incorrectly]

Where does this message come from?  Is it automatically 
generated by pine?  How do you know when someone's display
might garble your message?
