FF> If you're making a family outing of it, my advice is to show up no
FF> later than 4:30, drop the advance party off at the Mass Ave entrance
FF> to get in and hold seats, and then have the remaining party park the
FF> car and show up with pizza and soda.  (A good local pizza joint is
FF> Hi-Fi Pizza, 617/492-4600, located about 6 blocks up on the left at
FF> 496 Mass Ave.)
Hey this sounds soooo cool, why don't we have things like this in 
England? I MUST get over to Boston when I've finished my degree in a 
few years!! I hope the robot competition went really well.

P.S. Sorry, that was unnecessary bandwidth wastage. So I'll say at the 
same time, many thanks to Dr Martin for his designs and input, they are 
invaluable - thanks again!
I'm into 4 and 6 legged robots at present, so if anyone wants to discuss 
these in relation to Handboards, neural nets, subsumption architecture, 
BEAM bots etc. please drop me a line!
