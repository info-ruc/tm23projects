Perhaps you have the RJ11 cable wired wrong.  Make sure you have the
ground signal  and the data from pa7/digital 9 connected.

see below...

Looking at the digital and analog sensor headers:

live signal [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

+5v         [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
ground      [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]    [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

sensor#      15  14  13  12  11  10  9   8   7      6   5   4   3   2   1


The whole row labeled "+5v" is a source of +5v power.  The whole row
labeled "ground" is a source of ground.  The row labeled "live signal"
is 15 different signal pins.

To attach to the 9600 baud output, you must connect from the live
signal line of sensor 9, and any ground.  You might as well use the
ground beneath the sensor 9 signal.  It would connect to an RJ11 plug
(to go into the HB serial interface) as follows:


                                         RJ11 plug
                                      (metal side up)
