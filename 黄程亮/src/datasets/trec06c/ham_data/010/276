I think all of the oddly-shaped ones are owned by MTG.

Seriously, I no longer have set shop keys to check, but I believe we
have:
	about two 4'x8' (one with narrow frame)
	one(?) 3.5'x8'
	one(?) 3'x8'
	about two 3'x6' (one with 3/8", pieced top)
	two 4'x4' triangles
	one 4'x8' triangle
	miscellaneous smaller triangles
	two 4'x 4'/8' right trapezoids (both facing same direction)
	about two long, narrow rectangles
	two L-shaped -- one with all right angles
		one with the interior sides at angles
	one diamond shaped, four skinny trapezoids from Blood Brothers

There are two 4'x8', with 2x4 frames and overhanging tops, that ended up
in the MTG pile but I think were built by G&S.  There may be some other
'standard' sizes that I've forgotten.

The other half of the 4'x8' triangle should still be in the racks,
unframed.
