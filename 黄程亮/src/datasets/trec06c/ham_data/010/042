My last statement was, "Hope for the best."

We have had quite a bit of discussion about machines truncating and rewriting
headers, or choosing to pass only certain headers. I suggest that such machines
are not properly configured to handle MIME attachments. If any such machines
are along the path that mail travels from sender to receipient, the attachment
won't be unharmed. The headers must survive transport!

Otherwise, it ain't MIME; it's garbage.
