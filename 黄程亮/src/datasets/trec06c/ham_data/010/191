Here is a planet I came up with for my campaign.  It has lots
of fun possibilites, especially since my characters are
going to have their hyperengines cut out near it (evil laugh).
 Anyway, enjoy, and please offer comments!

Seeth

Capsule:  Seeth is the only remaining planet in the Archon
System.  The system's star, Archon, is now a red giant,
having consumed all the inner planets during periods of
fiery expansion.  Seeth, formerly the outermost ice planet
was promoted to a roiling volcanic maelstrom several
millenia ago.
        Having incredibly low gravity and being far away
from its dying sun, a massive volcano sprouted on its
surface, filling the entire western hemisphere, bulging
upward some sixty kilometers into the sky.  Great gouts of
lava poured forth from the volcano, and immediately upon
leaving the planet, the lava solidified into rock and was
flung into low orbit.  Hence, over the centuries, a
magnificent igneous asteroid belt was created around
Seeth, blanketing it in a swirl of rock.
        The treacherous asteroid belt deterred the
scouts that would have claimed it for the Empire, and
eventually a bankrupt Twi'lek mining corporation stumbled
across Seeth.  Desperate for new resources, scout ships
penetrated the dense asteroid belt and beheld Seeth for the
first time in recorded history.  The following is a subspace
transmission from Bar'sehb Prulkai, pilot of a small scout
ship, to the orbitting Twi'lek bulk freighter, on his first
contact with the world:
        "This is Starspinner One, breaking through the
asteroid field....all I can see is orange right
now....recalibrating [the] spectrometer....Great Skies!  It's a
volcano, must be scores of kilometers high!  [From what I
can see] it appears to have numerous lava fissures
sprouting from its sides...like the veins of the Jak'har back
on Ryloth.  Starspinner One moving in for closer
look...this thing is wreaking havoc on my sensors!  Noticing
a massive lava pool, covering maybe five hundred square
kilometers, [situated] to the east of the volcano...hundreds
of incredibly deep fissures and striations in the
crust....seems like a perpetual meteor shower is going
on....small asteroids are constantly igniting in the sky."
        Soon after, the Twi'lek corporation claimed Seeth
and all its resources.  They built an ingenius mining
platform in the center of the lava pool, and another, a space
station, was put in geostationary orbit.  The mining platform
in the center of the pool was astride what looked like a
whirpool, where the pooling lava drained downward to
some unknown depths.  The platform could easily sit there
and strain the vast array of minerals and metals that flowed
past its molecular seives.
        The space station only lasted for two years, but it
proved useful in obtaining various ores.  It was finally hit
with an asteroid and knocked out of the sky, burning up on
re-entry.
        Now the mining platform is the only visible sign
of inhabitance on Seeth.  Twice a month a convoy of cargo
haulers travelling the Perlemian Trade Route stop briefly to
rest, restock, and pick up the collected raw resources from
Seeth.  A one thousand person staff is needed to crew
the giant mining platform (it looks a bit like the Eiffel Tower)
and they perform their job faithfully, providing their buyers in
the deep core with a constant supply of raw minerals and
metals.
