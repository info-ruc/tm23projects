Subject: Eprom Programmer info

Hi all,
I have acquired an old Bytek Eprom/Pal programmer, Model S10 with and epm2
adapter. 
I have no manual.

Does anyone out there have one, who might be able to photocopy a few pages
from the manual.
Bytek was of no help.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
Les
