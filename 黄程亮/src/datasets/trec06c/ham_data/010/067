Hello
I have a Fast Traxx car made by Metro wich I would like to run using my
Handy Board
and I was wondering what was the best way to run the motors either piggy
backing the L293s or some how interfacing into the existing motor control
circuit on the car.
Has anyone done this before? The motors draw up to 6-8 amps when stalled!

Cheers,
