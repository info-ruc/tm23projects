>have you tried using motorola's pcbug utility?

I have PCbug running and I can boot the hc811, after reading the motorola
"Pink book"  and the tec. docs I cant find anything on how to set the congif
register. Does anyone know how to do this with the Pcbug software.

The strange this is I cant get them to set to anyting in the config reg.,
eeprom or not, the whole register is FF from 0 to F, (could the entire
config register be erased?, and can i re-enter the whole thing not just the
first bit).
I am guessing this is the problem because all my other 6811's have other
values in the config register and the first bit is 0C, but on mine its all
FF throughout.
