I am simply using PINE's "Take Address" function.  After a certain size, 
it (pine 3.91) won't take any more.  I have, however, copied very large 
address lists from a file into the message body, and then moved them into 
the BCC, and this worked fine.  So maybe the problem is that this pine 
can mail large numbers but it just can't take that many using its own 
function.
