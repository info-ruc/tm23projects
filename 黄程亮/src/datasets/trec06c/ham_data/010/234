Tom, it seems that your routines measure frequency but Yoni wanted to
count transitions.

Yoni, the approach is similar to what Tom has done in that you must
use the timer input channels to get high frequencies.  In the TCTL2
register, set the input lines to interrupt on either rising or falling
edges.  Create an interrupt routine that increments a memory variable
on each interrupt, and then resets the interrupt flag for the next
time.

Each transition on the timer input pin with then cause the memory
variable to be incremented.

Fred
