Sure, there's no reason you could set it up to use PD4, PD5, and
TIC3 for a 2nd sonar.

you might be able to get away with some signal multiplexing, assuming
you're only firing one sonar at a time.  i could see the BINH being no
problem.  For sharing the ECHO, make sure the polaroid outputs are
open collector so there isn't signal contention.
