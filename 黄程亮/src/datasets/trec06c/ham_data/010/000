Thanks, Margaret, for a point of view it wouldn't have occurred
to me to think of.  It's a kind of rock-and-hard-place thing from
my perspective - for myself, I prefer to have quotes first rather
than last because (and especially if there's a timelapse between
the original post and the reply) it's easier to pick up on the
discussion thread when the stream is chronological -
quote/reply/quote/reply...It hadn't occurred to me that that
might be a problem for some.  I wonder if there's a solution that
would suit everyone, at least to some extent....I'll have to give
that some thought.

And my question was................I have a client who wants to
save mail to folders, sans header.  Doesn't want anything except
maybe date and sender.  Is it possible to do that?  Anyone have
an idea how?  

Please let me know...

Marianne
