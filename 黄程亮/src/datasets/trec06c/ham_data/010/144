Subject: Connecting a second sonar module

I'm curious about connecting two of the Polaroid sonar modules to the Handy
Board v1.2.  Does anyone know whether ports PD2, PD3 and TIC2 can be used to
hook up the second unit in the same way that PD4, PD5 and TIC3 are used for
one unit?  Or is there a better way to do it that wouldn't use up so many of
the ports (e.g., both modules sharing the same BINH and/or ECHO signals)?

Thanks (and apologies if this is a rehash--I had trouble downloading the
whole 4MB mailing list archive!).
