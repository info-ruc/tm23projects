I am not a member of the mailing list.  I came across various references
to this in a search for pico.  

I have recently signed up with a new ISP.  I was happy to know that they
did offer a shell acount.  But when I logged into my shell I found that
they had next to no programs there for use.  

I have been given the go ahead to install some programs for them.  I
have located elm, and will be istalling that over the weekend.  I know
that it needs to be linked to a text editor.  Since all they have is vi
(yuck!) I need to install pico.  Not just for elm do we need pico, just
for ease of editing in general.

Where may I find pico and instructions for installation?

please reply to me directly, as I am not a member of this list.

Thank You
