The encoder function pages say that for the fast encoder, the refresh rate
is only 1 KHz.  That is it can make only 1000 increments in a second.  If
I have an encoder that has a change rate on the order of a micro second,
is there any reasonable way to use the encoder routines with it, or is
there anything else I could do to use the  8 MHz (I think) clock of the
6811 for this particular encoding procedure.
