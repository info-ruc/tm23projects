"Automatically" "No user intervention"?? The answer is no as you ask it.
You miss out many details of exactly what you are working with, but let's
make a few assumptions.
Presumably, you have telnetted into an account from a Win95 machine, and
have invoked Pine remotely to read your mail (it would have helped if you
had told us how you were doing this but it seems like maybe this is how
you're doing it)
Just highlight, copy, and paste whatever text is of interest into Notepad
from your telnet client screen. (bundled client with Win95 or some client
like NetTerm).
Maybe I'm missing something here, but that's how I read this.
