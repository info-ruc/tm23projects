Hubertus Th. Jongen, Klaus Meer and Eberhard Triesch, "Optimization Theory",
Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, Hardbound, ISBN 1-4020-8098-0, June 2004,

For more details, including Table of Contents, see the book's webpage 
http://www.imada.sdu.dk/Research/OptimizationTheory/ (in particular, it has a 
lot of optimization complexity results, explained from scratch). 

Book's description: 

Optimization Theory is becoming a more and more important mathematical as well 
as interdisciplinary area, especially in the interplay between mathematics and 
many other sciences like computer science, physics, engineering, operations 
research, etc. This volume gives a comprehensive introduction into the theory 
of (deterministic) optimization on an advanced undergraduate and graduate 
level. One main feature is the treatment of both continuous and discrete 
optimization at the same place. This allows to study the problems under 
different points of view, supporting a better understanding of the entire 
field. Audience: The book can be adapted well as an introductory textbook into 
optimization theory on a basis of a two semester course; however, each of its 
parts can also be taught separately. Many exercises are included to increase 
the reader's understanding.
