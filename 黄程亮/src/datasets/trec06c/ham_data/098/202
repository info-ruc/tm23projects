We originally planned two interval-related sessions: Weldon Lodwick is planning 
to organize a session on fuzzy optimization and Chenyi Hu was planning to 
organize a session on intervals and fuzzy in general. It looks like we did not 
have anough people for the second session, so everyone interested in welcome to 
submit to Weldon Lodwick's session. 

Please note that the deadline for conference submissions has been extended to 
January 17, 2005.

>CALL FOR PAPERS
>IFSA2005 World Congress
>July 28-31, 2005, Beijing China 
>http://ifsa2005.em.tsinghua.edu.cn 
>
>The 11th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association
>(IFSA 2005) will be held in Beijing China, July 28-31, 2005. As a
>major bi-annual event of IFSA, the Congress aims at bringing together
>scholars and practitioners from academia and industries to present
the
>latest development in theories and applications of fuzzy logic and
>soft computing. The scientific program will include keynote/plenary
>talks and technical parallel sessions that address important issues
of
>interest in the fields. The Congress will serve as a platform not
only
>for knowledge sharing, but also for stimulating new ideas in
>broadening and deepening theoretical and applied explorations of
fuzzy
>logic and soft computing. Notably, IFSA2005 will take place in the
>year of IFSA's 20th anniversary, which may well be an event of
memory
>and celebration in the course of its evolution. 
>
>This IFSA World Congress is to be the first-time-ever in Mainland
>China. China is a dynamic nation with a rapid economic growth and
huge
>market. The conference site is Beijing, which has been the capital of
>China for about five hundred years, and is now one of the largest
>international cities in the world. Nowadays, as the cultural,
>educational and Hi-tech center of the nation, Beijing possesses a
>large number of world-class conference facilities, communication
>infrastructures and hotels, and has successfully hosted many
important
>international conferences. In addition, Beijing is an ideal place for
>sightseeing. Its rich cultures and historical attractions such as the
>Great Wall, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, and Temple of Heaven will
>provide participants with unique experiences for social activities. 
>
>Topics
>We solicit papers on theoretical issues and their applications
related
>to fuzzy logic and soft computing. Suggested topics include but are
>not limited to: 
>* Mathematical Foundations of Fuzzy Set Theory 
>* Fuzzy Logic and Approximate Reasoning 
>* Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms and Soft Computing 
>* Fuzzy Control, Robots and Intelligent Techniques 
>* Expert Systems and Computational Intelligence 
>* Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 
>* Rough Sets and Evidence Theory 
>* Uncertainty in Decision Sciences and Optimization 
>* Signal/Image Processing and Pattern Recognition 
>* Fuzzy Databases and Information Retrieval 
>* Hybrid Systems 
>
