Dear DMDXers,

With the kind help of Jonathan and Ken, the 'Missing Item Number' problem 
is solved!

The problem arose from my having to run an algorithm to convert an older 
DMDX file containing Chinese characters from a version that uses 'Big-5' 
and 'GB' Chinese character encoding to Unicode Chinese character encoding. 
That algorithm successfully changed the Chinese character encoding, but it 
made unpredictable changes to things other than the Chinese character 
encoding. Most notably, the algorithm inserted line breaks/carriage returns 
and non-printing white spaces within the parameter line and within the 
quotes that designate things to be displayed on screen. This caused the 
Item Number and the $ to interact in strange fashion.

Once the problem was pointed out, I had to go in and find all carriage 
returns within the parameter line, quotes etc. and remove them manually. 
This wasn't so bad; what was hard was identifying the problem in the first 
place, because the diagnostics etc. pointed in the direction of  Missing 
Item Number and the $ scrambling operator (which I'm sure were intimately 
involved at some level!).

thanks to Ken and Jonathan!

Jerry
