Dear Arnold,

the solution  of a single quadratic equation in one variable
with interval coefficients has been discussed in detail in
Section 4 of the paper:

  N. S. Dimitrova,  S.  M.  Markov.  Ueber die
intervall-arithmetische Berechnung des Wertebereichs einer Funktion
mit Anwendungen, Freiburger Intervall-Berichte, Univ.  Freiburg, 81/4
(1981), 1--22.
