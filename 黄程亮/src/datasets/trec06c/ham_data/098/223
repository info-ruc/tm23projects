Dear Prof. J. Forster,

Thanks for your quick response to my previous question. After reading =
your
reply, I tried to use the "RecordVocal" function to run a DMDX file in =
two
different pc computers (one with Windows98 and the other one with =
WindowsXP
OS) and did some sound file analysing afterward. To my surprise, I found =
the
WAV files that I got from the two computers were different in their
duration. The WAV files that I got from the pc working with Win98 were
always 1500ms in duration (this was also the time-out time that I had =
preset
in the parameter line) while those that I got from the pc with WinXP =
varied
in their duration (all within 1500ms) (even though the same DMDX program =
was
run in the two computers). Then I looked up the waveform of the sound =
files
from the pc with WinXP and found that the files were always ended =
recording
when the waveform came to be static after the voice onset. It seems like =
the
pc working with WinXP was employing a criteria which is different from =
the
one used by Win98 system to terminate the voice input recording process. =
I
am not sure if this difference was due to the differences between two
operating systems or some other basic settings in the two computers. =
That
would be great if you could tell me some more about how to default the =
way
that the program would terminate the voice recording and if there is any
difference between different operating systems on this issue. Many =
thanks!

Regards,
Andus

   You can't, all you can get is onset.  You'll have to use RecordVocal =
and=20
use some later analysis software to determine duration.

As long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong?
