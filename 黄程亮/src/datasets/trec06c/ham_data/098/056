   Don't think it's ever been documented as it's in ticks and the duration 
of a tick depends on display mode.

#define FB_DELAY        2       /* delay of feedback signal */
#define FB_DUR  35      /* duration of feedback message (default) */

   No, it'll always be 35 ticks unless you change it.  The delay before the 
feedback is likely to be longer than 2 ticks if your machine can't assemble 
the display that quickly though.

   Other than that they sum, no.  But I'm not going to guarantee that a 
fixed ISI is possible with feedback till I tear the code apart.  Can't see 
the point personally as feedback is usually contingent upon a response.

   Basically if you care that much about feedback duration and it's delay 
you need to be writing your own feedback routines as outlined in the 
branching documentation.

Five is a sufficiently close approximation to infinity.
