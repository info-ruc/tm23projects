Hi All,

I'm preparing my data for analysis using Nan Jiang's instructions. However, when
I put everything into Analyze and hit "analyze" I get the following error
message:

parameter error
Item file has 420 non-instruction item numbers
sorting items...

What does this mean?

My spec file is slightly complicated with some items being in more than one
condition---does this matter?

I've got this to work before and I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong this
time.


Thanks,


Carrie
