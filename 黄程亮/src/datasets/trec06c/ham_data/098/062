Hi all,
First of all, thank you very much Gareth for your suggestion it worked.

Second I am still having problems with this input box, now it has been 
recognized by DmDx but two of the buttons ( they where called by timeDx 
"Asse X" and "Asse Y") are not recognized by DmDx.
As Gareth suggested me in the case of button box name recognition, I have 
tried to use quotes but in this case it didn't work.
Moreover with the other buttons DmDx didn't collect any answer, even if 
while checking he didn't give me any error.

Thank you for any kind of suggestion,

Leonardo
