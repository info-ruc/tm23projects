   Yep, that's the way the original 8255 hardware was and the way InstaCal 
still represent that port.  DMDX has no choice when it is writing to it as 
it's two devices.  Historical reasons are there but it's still a little 
irritating and in your case a liability.

   Don't think so.  Not unless they've written a new version of the 
Universal Library that represents port C as one device and not two like the 
version I have does (unlikely).  Best bet for you is to use the DMDX 16 bit 
output device and use port B instead of port C.  Of course you'll have to 
multiply all your codes by 256 but those higher 8 bits of output will be 
synchronous.  Usually one tries to build a paradigm that doesn't rely on 
synchronous changes though, things like one line being a strobe that's 
toggled after the data bits have been set up.

   Then again you could always use Keithley Crap, at least that stuff has 8 
bit output (even if it is delayed by hundreds of microseconds).  But I'm 
willing to bet you don't want to buy new interface cards.
