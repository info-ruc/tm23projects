A. Neumaier and A. Pownuk,
Linear systems with large uncertainties, with applications to truss
structures


Abstract
--------
Linear systems whose coefficients have large uncertainties
arise routinely in finite element calculations for
structures with uncertain geometry, material properties, or loads.
However, a true worst case analysis of the influence of such
uncertainties was previously possible only for very small systems
and uncertainties, or in special cases where the coefficients do
not exhibit dependence.

This paper presents a method for computing rigorous bounds on the
solution of such systems, with a computable overestimation factor that
is frequently quite small. The merits of the new approach are
demonstrated by computing realistic bounds for some large, uncertain
truss structures, some leading to linear systems with over
5000 variables and over 10000 interval parameters, with excellent
bounds for up to about 10% input uncertainty.

Also discussed are some counterexamples for the performance of
traditional approximate methods for worst case uncertainty analysis.
