Arnold,

I looked at it some years ago, when I was programming the elementary
functions for GlobSol's constraint propagation.  I even wrote a routine
for it.  However, I never published it, and it is not contained
in the distribution version of GlobSol.  Furthermore, I don't think
I proved that it was the tightest possible machine enclosure for the
solution set.  Thus, if I'm the only one who did it, it's "fair game"
for you to write it up :-)

Best regards,

Baker
