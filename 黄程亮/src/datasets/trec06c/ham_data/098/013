   Scope

   The conference is concerned with the theory of computability
   and complexity over real-valued data.

   Computability and complexity theory are two central areas
   of research in mathematical logic and theoretical computer
   science. Computability theory is the study of the limitations
   and abilities of computers in principle. Computational
   complexity theory provides a framework for understanding the
   cost of solving computational problems, as measured by the
   requirement for resources such as time and space.
   The classical approach in these areas is to consider
   algorithms as operating on finite strings of symbols from a
   finite alphabet. Such strings may represent various discrete
   objects such as integers or algebraic expressions, but cannot
   represent general real or complex numbers, unless they are
   rounded.

   Most mathematical models in physics and engineering, however,
   are based on the real number concept. Thus, a computability
   theory and a complexity theory over the real numbers and over
   more general continuous data structures is needed. Unlike the
   well established classical theory over discrete structures,
   the theory of computation over continuous data is still in
   its infancy, despite remarkable progress in recent years.
   Many important fundamental problems have not yet been studied,
   and presumably numerous unexpected and surprising results are
   waiting to be detected.

   Scientists working in the area of computation on real-valued
   data come from different fields, such as theoretical computer
   science, domain theory, logic, constructive mathematics,
   computer arithmetic, numerical mathematics and all branches
   of analysis. The conference provides a unique opportunity for
   people from such diverse areas to meet and exchange ideas and
   knowledge.

   The topics of interest include foundational work on various
   models and approaches for describing computability and
   complexity over the real numbers. They also include
   complexity-theoretic investigations, both foundational and
   with respect to concrete problems, and new implementations of
   exact real arithmetic, as well as further developments of
   already existing software packages. We hope to gain new
   insights into computability-theoretic aspects of various
   computational questions from physics and from other fields
   involving computations over the real numbers.

   Proceedings

   A technical report including the accepted papers will be
   distributed at the conference.

   It is planned to publish a special issue of the
   Journal of Complexity dedicated to the conference.
   After the workshop, the participants will be invited to submit
   their papers for publication in this special issue. The papers
   will be subject to the usual refereeing process of the journal.


   Venue

   The conference will be held on the Yoshida Campus of
   Kyoto University.
   Kyoto was the imperial capital of Japan for over 1000 years
   until 1867. It has many famous temples, shrines, national
   treasures, and festivals, and it is still the cultural center
   of Japan. Kyoto is also known as an academic city with many
   universities and research institutes.


   Local Information

   Kyoto is about 100 km north-east of Kansai International
   Airport.
   Travel and on-site information will soon be available on the
   web site of the conference.


   Support

   The conference is supported by the Graduate School of Human
   and Environmental Studies, Kyoto University.
