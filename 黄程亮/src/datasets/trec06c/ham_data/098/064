   You need to use quotes around names with spaces on them anywhere in DMDX 
(it's in the documenatation):

<n 4><azk><nfb> <fd 115> <t 1900> <id tastiera> <mr +spazio> <id mouse> 
<mpr "+pulsante 1"> <mnr "+pulsante 0"> <id "2 asse  pulsante gamepad"> 
<mpr "+Pulsante 1"> <mnr "+Pulsante 2"> <dbc 0> <dwc 240240240> <d 90 > <vm 
1440, 900, 900, 16, 0> <cr>

   You'll also have real trouble is the names of the buttons on the game 
pad are the same as the names of the buttons on the mouse, you will have to 
not include the mouse.

                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X
     ASCII RIBBON CAMPAIGN - AGAINST HTML MAIL  / \

   If you do not change your direction, you may end where you are
headed.
