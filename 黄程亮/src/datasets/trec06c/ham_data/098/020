This well-written paper by Neumaier and Pownuk offer a new method 
representing an advance over pre-existing methods for a particular class of 
problems: uncertainty analysis in structural mechanics based on finite 
element analysis when the only uncertainty is in the element stiffness 
coefficients. The authors intelligently exploit the structure of such 
problems with "proper pre-conditioning" and iterative methods. Well-chosen 
examples illustrate the advantages over other methods.

Perhaps only two suggestions are in order. (1) Some brief summary of the key 
ideas of "the new approach" should be included in the abstract and in the 
introduction. (2) On page 22, lines 4 and 5 from the top, the u's should 
have double-primes.

Congratulations Arnold and Andrzej, this is an excellent paper.

Ramon Moore

> --------
> Linear systems whose coefficients have large uncertainties
> arise routinely in finite element calculations for
> structures with uncertain geometry, material properties, or loads.
> However, a true worst case analysis of the influence of such
> uncertainties was previously possible only for very small systems
> and uncertainties, or in special cases where the coefficients do
> not exhibit dependence.
>
> This paper presents a method for computing rigorous bounds on the
> solution of such systems, with a computable overestimation factor that
> is frequently quite small. The merits of the new approach are
> demonstrated by computing realistic bounds for some large, uncertain
> truss structures, some leading to linear systems with over
> 5000 variables and over 10000 interval parameters, with excellent
> bounds for up to about 10% input uncertainty.

> Also discussed are some counterexamples for the performance of
> traditional approximate methods for worst case uncertainty analysis.
