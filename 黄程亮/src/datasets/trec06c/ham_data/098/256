Europe Fights Tide of Absurd Patents"
        New Scientist (01/08/05) Vol. 185, No. 2481, P. 22; Fox, Barry 

        The European Parliament is likely to soon pass a European Commission 
directive that bans software and
        business method patents in order to avoid a patent inundation that 
could hamper technological innovation
        by encouraging infringement lawsuits. There is a long-standing 
consensus between European politicians and
        programmers that copyright already provides adequate protection for 
software, making broadly applicable
        software patents unwanted. But patent applicants have been exploiting a 
loophole that allows software to be
        patented as a computer-implemented invention--a loophole that the draft 
directive seeks to remove. The
        directive has traveled a bumpy road to approval by the parliament: The 
original draft did not clearly
        distinguish between software-controlled inventions and the software 
that controls such inventions, so a
        provision that banned pure software patents was inserted. However, the 
European Industry Association for
        Information Systems, Communication Technologies, and Consumer 
Electronics (EICTA) complained that the
        legislation's wording permitted a patented technique with a 
"significant purpose" to be used without
        infringement, so the commission and the parliament are debating a new 
draft that is expected to make
        allowances for computer-implemented inventions that include a 
"technical contribution." The Foundation for
        a Free Information Infrastructure's Rufus Pollock warns that such a 
term is vulnerable to overly broad
        interpretation that could permit software patenting.
