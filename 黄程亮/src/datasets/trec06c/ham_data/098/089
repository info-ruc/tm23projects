Hi Jonathan,
We have had continued infrequent problems using DMDX to send triggers 
(event codes) with the Computerboards/Measurement Computing PIO card 
to 
amplifiers (Neuroscan synamps) that are monitoring participant's 
physiology.  Periodically, triggers recorded by the synamps are 
incorrect.  I've been working with an engineer here and he believes he 
has identified the source of the problem.  Here is what he says....

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
New and interesting info about DMDX and SYNAMPS trigger ports.

The 3 erroneous values  out of 1000 received by SYNAMPS are also 
occurring on your systems on the first floor.  I've pretty well 
characterized the behavior, and I think I know what is going on.

It starts with DMDX and the I/O card.  DMDX is writing to port C one 
nibble at a time, not a whole byte.  First it writes the lower 4 bits, 
then it writes the higher 4 bits, 4 microseconds later.

It appears that the synamps does _not_ watch the 
trigger port continuously and wait for a change and log it.  I believe 
it samples the trigger port at the same rate that it samples the A/D 
converter and when it sees something other than 255 at the sample 
time, it logs it, then waits for it to go back to 255 and starts 
looking again for change - at the sampling rate.

The sampling rate clock is running asynchronously to the trigger port 
pulses, so every now and then (approx 3 out of 1000) the trigger port 
is 
sampled during that 4 us. when half of the byte at port C is correct 
and the other half is all ones, leading to the bad trigger values that 
Jeremy 
is reporting.

Port C has the ability to be written as a complete byte but it appears 
that either the DMDX author or the card manufacturer drivers chose not 
to use it that way.  I would lean towards it being a DMDX problem.
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Is he correct that DMDX writes to  port C in two sets of 4 bits rather 
than the full byte?  If so, I agree with him that this could be the 
source of our trigger problem with the synamps.  In fact, the specific 
trigger errors are all consistent with his assessment.

If he is correct, is it possible to have new PIO devices that write 
the full byte to Port C rather than two successive nibbles?  I have 
sponsored changes in the past but if needed would be willing to 
sponsor another if you are willing to make such a change.

Thanks John
