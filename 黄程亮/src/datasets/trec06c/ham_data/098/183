The only case worked out in detail by Hansen and Walster is that of
quadratics. With some simple hints, a complete solution for
quadratics can be found by diligent students in a few hours,
at the same level of quality as Hansen and Walster's, or even better.

Indeed, they write on p.119 of their paper, ''The simpler algorithm
has probably also been often used; but the authors are unaware of any
publication describing it.'' Thus they admit that the contents is
''readily apparent to practitioners skilled in the art''
(a quote from their patent application; they use it in an opposite
context), and hence not patentable.

What do the law experts say?


Everything is in fact very elementary.
The only difficulty is that there are many cases to consider,
more than an average student would have the guts to consider.
So the students should be told that they need to use monotonicity
arguments and have to consider 16 cases, depending on the signs of
a,b,c,x. See my other mail for a neatly polished solution, with all
bells and whistles (which probably could be expected only by very
good students).

It takes much less work than the procedure of Hansen and Walster
who always compute up to 8 interval enclosures of roots.
