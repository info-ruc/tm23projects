From: krj@cs.toronto.edu

... there would be two sessions on
Validated methods for differential equations at the upcoming SciCADE 
meeting in Nagoya, Japan, May 23-27, 2005. 
The URL for the conference is 

 	http://www.math.human.nagoya-u.ac.jp/scicade05/

...

The focus
of the conference is not validated computing, but there will be two
sessions on validated methods for differential equations.  However, it
is a very good conference for anyone interested in numerical methods
for differential equations.

Best regards,
Ken
