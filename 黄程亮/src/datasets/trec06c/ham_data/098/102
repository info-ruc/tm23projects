Hello all:

I'm trying to make a spatial working memory span program with DMDX, but I meet two
problems. Please help me.
First problem: Here is a two span program that I have done. I give subjects two
picture that each has one letter with one possible angle, and subjects must judge
whether this letter is mirror letter or not. then I give them eight possible angle
to recall ordinally.
I want to make the letter DISAPPEARED on subject's pressing B or N in the
keyboard.How can I do this? 

Second problem: I want the program ends immediately after subjects failed on BOTH
response task(that is subjects failed on Item 1003 and 1004), If they just failed
one response task, the program will go on. How can I do this? I have tried
branching keywords, but I didn't found the answer.
Please help me, Thank You!
