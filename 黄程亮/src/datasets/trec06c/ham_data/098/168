To me it seems that this method is a reinvention of what already appears in Section 7 of

@Article{Hong:94b,
  author = 	 "Hoon Hong and Volker Stahl",
  title = 	 "Safe Starting Regions by Fixed Points and Tightening",
  journal =	 "Computing",
  year =	 1994,
  volume =	 53,
  pages =	 "323--335",
}

... this might also be relevant for the patent application ...
