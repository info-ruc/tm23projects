Colleagues,

I see steady reference to articles in the "Freiburger Intervallberichte,"
and I personally have a need from time to time to look up articles
therein.  Also, my understanding is that, since Freiburger Intervallberichte
was a preprint series, copyright issues are not involved.

I see significant benefit in having electronic (i.e. scanned) copies
of the Freiburger Intervallberichte on the web (such as on 
interval.louisiana.edu).  However, someone will actually have to 
scan the series (ideally into PDF), a significant but not prohibitive
task.  We thus need a volunteer (or a volunteering of resources) to
scan the series.

Does anyone wish to volunteer?  Also, does anyone have comments concerning
this proposed endeavor?

Sincerely,

R. Baker Kearfott
