   Oh, I see.  Because the voice energy is still enough to trigger the 
digital VOX.

   They're different, they differ by microseconds however which isn't 
enough to show up with the precision that's used by default.

   You'll have to see if the enhanced vox settings can't reduce the 
frequency that the +DigitalVOX is being sent at.

   As long as the VOX is stuffing hundreds of responses in there any design 
is going to be tough to implement.  Don't think anyone's ever really tried 
to use the VOX with zillion mode before.  If you can't reduce the frequency 
of VOX responses with the enhanced settings then I'll see if I can't clear 
that code up a bit.
