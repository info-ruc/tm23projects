   Read up all the RecordVocal threads in the list.  Basically you want 
<RecordVocal 1500> and not <RecordVocal>.

Prof. J. Forster,<br><br>
Thanks for your quick response to my previous question. After reading
your<br>
reply, I tried to use the &quot;RecordVocal&quot; function to run a DMDX
file in two<br>
different pc computers (one with Windows98 and the other one with
WindowsXP<br>
OS) and did some sound file analysing afterward. To my surprise, I found
the<br>
WAV files that I got from the two computers were different in their<br>
duration. The WAV files that I got from the pc working with Win98
were<br>
always 1500ms in duration (this was also the time-out time that I had
preset<br>
in the parameter line) while those that I got from the pc with WinXP
varied<br>
in their duration (all within 1500ms) (even though the same DMDX program
was<br>
run in the two computers). Then I looked up the waveform of the sound
files<br>
from the pc with WinXP and found that the files were always ended
recording<br>
when the waveform came to be static after the voice onset. It seems like
the<br>
pc working with WinXP was employing a criteria which is different from
the<br>
one used by Win98 system to terminate the voice input recording process.
I<br>
am not sure if this difference was due to the differences between
two<br>
operating systems or some other basic settings in the two computers.
That<br>
would be great if you could tell me some more about how to default the
way<br>
that the program would terminate the voice recording and if there is
any<br>
difference between different operating systems on this issue. Many
thanks!</font></blockquote><br>
