dear DMDXers,

I am having the same 'Missing Item Number' problem that I 
have seen referred to in the archives involving the $. I 
have just about exhausted all avenues and so now turn to the 
list for help.

The program is aborted where the second $ occurs closing the 
first bunch of non-scrambled items (experiment directions) 
and just before the first real experimental item. 

The 'JOB ABORTED' message on the DMDX screen (not 
diagnostics) seems to refer to a seemingly arbitrary place 
earlier in the file.

I'd appreciate any help I can get.

thanks,

Jerry
