Dear all,
I have a strange problem with the USB gamepad we have adapted here at the 
lab in order to have a cheap button box.

the test in time DX gave me the following name for it:

2 asse 12 pulsante game pad

and the diagnostic window after having rcognized mouse and keyboard 
recognize it as

2 asse 12 pulsante game pad

which is the correct name. But after It tells me:

input device <2> selection failed

mi setting line in the itam file was the following ( with the full name for 
the box and not only "2"):

<n 4><azk><nfb> <fd 115> <t 1900> <id tastiera> <mr +spazio> <id mouse> 
<mpr +pulsante 1> <mnr +pulsante 0> <id 2 asse  pulsante gamepad> <mpr 
+Pulsante 1> <mnr +Pulsante 2> <dbc 0> <dwc 240240240> <d 90 > <vm 1440, 
900, 900, 16, 0> <cr>

I tried to remove the mouse but it still doesn't work. I think that in some 
way it depends on the fact that the device's name hase spaces in it.

If someone facing this problem has been able to solve it or has some 
suggestion to give me i would appreciate the help.

Thank you in advance,

Leonardo Lancia
