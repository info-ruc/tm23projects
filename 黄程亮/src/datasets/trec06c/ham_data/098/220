Dear Sir/Madam.
 
I am Engr. Michael Kebelo, a native of Cape Town and
Director Of Project Implementation, South Africa.
Ministry Of Mining and Natural Resources. I am making
this contact with you, based on the committee?s need
for an Individual/company who is willing to assist in
the execution of this business.

I have decided to seek a confidential cooperation
with you in the execution of this deal described here under
for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep
it as a top secret, because of the nature of this
transaction. Within the Ministry Of Mining And Natural
Resources, where I work as a Director of the Project
Implementation and with the good cooperation of four
other top officials, we have in our possession as over
due payment bills, totaling Sixteen Million, Four
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$16,400,000)
Which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance
and cooperation of A Foreign Company/individual to
receive the said funds on our behalf. 

More so, we are handicap in these circumstances, as
the South African Civil Services code of conduct does
not allow us to operate an offshore account. Hence
your importance in this transaction.
This amount $16.4Million represents the balance of
the total contract value executed on behalf of my
department by a Foreign Contracting Firm, which we the
Officials over invoiced deliberately. 

Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the
original
contractor,leaving the balance in the tune of the said
amount,
Which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer K.T.T. to any Foreign
Bank Account you will provide by filing an Application
through the Ministry Of Justice here in South Africa,
for the transfer of rights and privileges of the
former contractor to you.

I have the Authority of my partners involved to
propose that you should be willing to assist us in
this transaction, Your share of the sum is 30% of the
$16.4Million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and
miscellaneous expenses. The transaction it self is
100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost
secrecy and confidentiality. Also, your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction. 

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
will not disappoint me. I want to assure you that my
partner and myself are in the position to make the
payment of this claim possible, provided that you can
give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that the
funds will be secured and please, remember to teat
this matter very confidential, because we will not
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still
in active Government service.

Once again, remember that time is of great essence in
this transaction.
 
I wait in anticipation your response
 
Thanks and God Bless you.
 
Yours truly,
Engr. Michael Kabelo
