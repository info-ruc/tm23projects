                 Technical Cyber Security Alert TA05-012A
Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Icon and Cursor Processing

   Original release date: January 12, 2005
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT

Systems Affected

   Microsoft Windows Operating Systems excluding Microsoft Windows XP SP2

Overview

   Microsoft Windows contains multiple vulnerabilities in the way that it
   handles cursor and icon files. A remote attacker could execute
   arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.

I. Description

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS05-002 describes a number of
   vulnerabilities in the way that Windows handles icons, cursors,
   animated cursors, and bitmaps. Further details are available in the
   following vulnerability notes:

   VU#625856 - Microsoft Windows LoadImage API vulnerable to integer
   overflow

   The Microsoft Windows LoadImage routine is vulnerable to an integer
   overflow that may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on
   a vulnerable system.
   (CAN-2004-1049)

   VU#697136 - Microsoft Windows kernel vulnerable to denial-of-service
   condition via animated cursor (.ani) rate number

   A vulnerability exists in the way the Microsoft Windows kernel
   processes animated cursor (.ani) files with a rate number set to zero.
   Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to
   cause a denial-of-service condition.
   (CAN-2004-1305)

   VU#177584 - Microsoft Windows kernel vulnerable to denial-of-service
   condition via animated cursor (.ani) frame number

   A vulnerability exists in the way the Microsoft Windows kernel
   processes animated cursor (.ani) files with a frame number set to
   zero. Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker
   to cause a denial-of-service condition.
   (CAN-2004-1305)

   Note that exploits for these vulnerabilities are publicly available.

II. Impact

   If a remote attacker can persuade a user to access a specially crafted
   bitmap image, icon, or cursor file, the attacker may be able to
   execute arbitrary code on that user's system, with their privileges.
   Potentially, any operation that displays an image could trigger
   exploitation; for instance, browsing the file system, reading HTML
   email, or browsing websites.

III. Solution

Install an Update

   Install the update as described in Microsoft Security Bulletin
   MS05-002. Please also note that this update is also available via
   Windows Update and Automatic Updates.
