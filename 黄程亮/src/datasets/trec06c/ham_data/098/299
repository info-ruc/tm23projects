Dear Dr. Wang,

Here is my summary of SVG vs. Flash:

http://www.cs.kent.edu/~xlai/SVGvsFlash.htm

Please also visit this link:

I believe SVG has a more promising future although so far Flash is more
popular, and it has advantages for developing GeoSVG. I still choose SVG
to develop my geometry tool. However, I may develop some manipulatives using
Flash in the future because it has better multimedia support.

Thanks.

Xun
