   No VOX setting will change the sound that is recorded beyond where it 
starts recording.

   No, just a different VOX algorithm, it's in the documentation.

   Only one is and it's you AFAIK.  But it makes no sense having the VOX 
present thousands of responses so I'll look at it.

   Zil will only look at the first response and that's the +DigitalVOX 
which is correct.
