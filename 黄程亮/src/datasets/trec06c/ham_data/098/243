POSTDOCTORAL POSITION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE,

INRIA/ECOLE NORMALE SUPERIEURE, LYON FRANCE

(CNRS/ENSL/INRIA/UCBL)

Laboratoire LIP, cole Normale Suprieure,
46 Alle d'Italie, 69364 Lyon Cedex 07 France

The   INRIA  project Arenaire  offers  a  12 months postdoc position
starting as soon as possible.

Objectives

Last  years have seen major  investments  in public-key cryptography
research.    Indeed, new commercial   cryptographic products rely on
very  high  ciphering   speed.  The   efficiency  of   cryptographic
algorithms is a  crucial issue nowadays,  and the design of hardware
implementations is an important point  for providing new  solutions.

In  collaboration   with    several other   groups    (ACI  Securite
Informatique --- http://www-rocq.inria.fr/codes/OCAM), the objective
of the postdoc is to participate to  the development of a FPGA-based
PC  board   prototype for  digital  signature.   Together   with the
development of an experimental   platform   for best software    and
hardware solutions   comparizon, the goal   is to offer   a complete
hardware   demonstrator  usable  by  any    standard computer.  Work
directions   may  concern  FPGA  programming,  elaboration  of  test
programs, data communication and system aspects.

A joint  research   project  of the  candidate   may be around
cryptography, low-power   hardware,    or   hardware  for   computer
arithmetic.

Arnaire project.

Arnaire is a  project of 16  researchers which aims at  elaborating
and consolidating knowledge in the field of computer arithmetic.  We
contribute  to the improvement of   the available arithmetic, at the
hardware  level   as well as  at  the  software level, on computers,
processors,   dedicated or    embedded    chips, etc.   Reliability,
accuracy, and speed are major goals that drive our studies.  We also
take  into account other    constraints such as power   consumption,
certification  using formal   proof   techniques or  reliability  of
numerical software.  Target arithmetics  are fixed or floating point
format, interval arithmetic, finite  fields arithmetic  and multiple
precision.

Skills and application

Knowledge in hardware design, for instance using VHDL for FPGAs, and
in the domain of cryptographic algorithms will be appreciated.

Interested  candidates  should  contact or  send   files directly to
{Arnaud.Tisserand, Gilles.Villard}@ens-lyon.fr as soon as  possible.
Files must contain  a cv, a brief  description of research work  and
recommendation letters.
