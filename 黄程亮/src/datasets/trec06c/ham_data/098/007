 Thank you for the quick reply, Jonathan!  :-)

 I added <vzk +DigitalVox> and, yes, my original problem was solved--verbal
responses are now in the azk file.  But then there are two ensuing questions
(sorry~):

 (1) Why did the same RTs repeat 60 times in one trial?

 I got something like "1016.00 +DigitalVox" repeating about 60 times in one
trial, but all I said into the microphone was "He seems very happy".

 Here is my parameter line:

 <ep> <cr> <azk> <nfb> <id keyboard> <id DigitalVox> <id RecordVocal> <zil>
<vzk +DigitalVox> <vzk +J> <vzk +K> <t 8000> </ep>

 I know <zor> can be added to get one RT only, but could you tell me what I
might have done wrong such that I got 60 responses with the same, instead of
different, RTs?

 (2) Could I get one RT each for both keyboard & audio inputs?

 When I added <zor> into the above parameter line, it was either keyboard or
audio response that was captured, depending on which one came first.  But in
this exp, I was hoping to get one RT each for both keyboard and audio inputs
(i.e., something like [1005,+DigialVox 3423.00, +J] for one trial).  Is
there a way to do this?

 Again, thank you very much for taking time to respond.  I really appreciate
it!

 best,
shiaohui
