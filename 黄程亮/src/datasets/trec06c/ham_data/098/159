Is there a complete discussion in the literature of the solution
of a single quadratic equation in one variable,
with interval coefficients? Perhaps even an implementation
that computes a correctly rounded enclosure for the solution set?

I worked out a solution myself, but this problem is so natural
that it was probably treated before.
