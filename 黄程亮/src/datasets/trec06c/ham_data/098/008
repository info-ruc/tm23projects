Hi All,

I'm about to upgrade our aging DMDX fleet and was looking at the Dell 
Precision series.

The only hardware in these systems I've not experienced with DMDX 
before are the video cards, there is the choice of either the NVIDIA 
Quadro or the ATI FireGL series.

Has anyone used any of these two cards with DMDX and if so can they 
recommend (or flame) either of them?

thanks,
Craig
