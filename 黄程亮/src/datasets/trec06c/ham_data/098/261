Patrizia,

Yes, that seems to be an interesting conjecture.  Do I understand
that you are conjecturing that, if you take the Taylor representation
for a polynomial, the intervals of minimum width in the Taylor
representation correspond to intervals of minimum width of the
exact range?  I don't know of results like that, although Martin Berz
or his students may. 

You might also clarify the conjecture by reminding us how you
are choosing the base point x_0, or if it matters.  Someone should
be able to come up with a proof or counterexample.

Sincerely,

Baker

>Indeed, my objective is NOT the accurate evaluation of the exact range of the 
polynomial. Instead I am looking for an approach that gives me information about 
where the region of minimum variability of the function is located. To this aim, 
it is enough for me that the overestimation of the united extension is the 
minimum in the interval wherein the function shows the lowest sensitivity. Note 
that it is enough to know that we have THERE the minimum overestimation with 
respect to the overestimation obtained for the interval of the same width, but 
centered in any other point.
>
>Note that the range I look for may not to be coincident with a minimum/maximum 
of the function f(x). If the amplitude of the united extension f(X(k)) is 
w(f(X(k)))=max(f(X(k)))-min(f(X(k))), we are looking for the X(k) to which 
corresponds the minimum w(f(X(k))). That is the region of minimum variability.
>
>Now, I was trying an interval extension F(X(k)) of f(x) on the interval X(k) 
such that w(F(X(k))) had the same behaviour of w(f(X(k))). In particular that 
w(F(X(k))) was minimum just where w(f(X(k))) was, even if w(F(X(k)))>> 
w(f(X(k))).
>
>Actually, using the Taylor Model of f as interval extension (F_TM(X(k))), i.e. 
by using the complete Taylor series of f(x) around x0(k) and estimating it in 
terms of interval variable, I have verified that w(F(X(k))) keeps the presence 
of local and absolute minima just where local and absolute minima of w(f(X(k))) 
are. In particular it is true for a generic parabola and for all the polynomials 
that I have randomly obtained (from 3rd to 9th order). Moreover this 
characteristic is maintained for all delta, i.e. both tight and wide interval.
>
>I think improbable that these are only coincidences, rather I'm looking for a 
justification to this behaviour in the properties of the Taylor Model.
>Can you help me about this topics? May this result be extended to any 
polynomial function? Are there some theorems about this?
>
>I have not found a precise reference to this topic in literature, but I am 
afraid I am not searching for in the right way. I am sure that you can address 
me in the right way.
>
>At the best of your knowledge, is somewhere anyone who has been interested in 
the region of minimum w(f(X(k))) rather than the minimum of f(X(k)), or the best 
inclusion of the function?
