Dear all,

I am currently employing the DMDX program to conduct a research about =
speech production. As the duration of the subjects' naming response is =
one of the DVs in this study, I would like to ask how to obtain this =
data with the DMDX program, many thanks for your attention.

Regards,
Andus Wong
