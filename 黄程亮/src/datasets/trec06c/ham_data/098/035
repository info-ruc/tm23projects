   This release of DMDX rectifies an oversight where the +DigitalVOX 
response is repeatedly presented.  Hasn't been a problem till the recent 
use of zillion responses with the VOX.  The code was intended to be in 
there and indeed part of it was, it's just that not all of it was fully 
implemented -- now it is.

   That's the x.x.x.1 part of the release, the x.x.2.x part of the release 
is a rather substantial set of changes made in tracking down a crash here 
that no one should notice but you never can tell.  Changes include fixes in 
the way errors are handled in the real time routines that shouldn't affect 
anyone because those errors are fatal ones (ie DMDX could lockup up or 
crash without an error message, now there should be one), DMDX now also 
pumps the windows message queue dry in between items which could 
conceivably affect some people that are pushing DMDX to the limit (but I'd 
be really impressed, longest time I noticed the 900Mhz Duron busy there was 
still less than a millisecond).  Previously it would only process a single 
message per item in a continuous running job which could cork things up a 
bit, now it'll get them all.  And a few other changes like video service 
routine not doing anything when the job is terminated because on a slow 
machine it can wind up doing bad things -- none of which anyone should 
notice but they are all changes to deep nitty gritty bits of DMDX so be 
warned.  If anything people should notice a significant up tick in the 
responsiveness of DMDX to ESC when trying to abort continuous running jobs.
