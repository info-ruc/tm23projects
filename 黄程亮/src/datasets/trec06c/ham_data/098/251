Dear Vladik,

Our community might be interested in the book,
Rafi Muhanna and Robert Mullen have a chapter entitled "Interval Methods for 
Reliable computing"; several other chapters are relevant 
***************************************************************************
Efstratios Nikolaidis, Dan Ghiocel, and Suren Singhal recently edited the CRC 
Engineering 
Reliability Design Handbook.  This book was published in December 
2004.  The handbook contains 45 chapters written by well-respected experts 
from government labs, companies and universities.  The book contents 
include methods for uncertainty quantification using probabilistic and non 
probabilistic approaches, computational methods for reliability assessment, 
reliability based design optimization, decision  making in the face of 
uncertainty and testing for reliability certification.  Applications in 
aerospace, automotive, civil and ocean engineering are presented.  Success 
stories demonstrating the benefits of non deterministic approaches are 
included.  A unique feature of the book is that it presents the 
perspectives of leaders from government labs, the industry and the academia 
on non deterministic methods.

A pdf flier is attached to the mention of this book in the Books part of the 
interval computations website http://www.cs.utep.edu/interval-comp
