Thanks for being patient with me, Jonathan (and thank all list members for
tolerating my endless questions!).  I am sorry that I couldn't read the
documentation hard enough to detect the problems myself.  I am sort of a new
comer of DMDX, so almost every sentence in the help manual is new to me, but
I know that shouldn't be an excuse. :-)

period.

Thanks for pointing it out, but I still cannot get rid of the problem of
getting multiple inputs of the same RTs.  Here is part of the script again:

<ep> <cr> <azk> <nfb> <id keyboard> <id RecordVocal 1200> <id DigitalVox>
<zil> <vzk +DigitalVox> <vzk +J> <vzk +K> </ep>

+1 <umpr> <umnr> <mpr +DigitalVox> <mpr +K> <mnr +J> <wav> "sentence1"  <svp
start> /<fd 350> <bmp> "sequence 1"/*!;


This time, instead of saying a whole sentence, I only said one word "HE" to
the mic and pressed the key "K" at the same time.  And here is what I got in
the output file (for one item only):


1998.00,+DigitalVOX 2101.43,+K 1998.00,+DigitalVOX 1998.00,+DigitalVOX
1998.00,+DigitalVOX 98.00,+DigitalVOX 1998.00,+DigitalVOX
1998.00,+DigitalVOX 1998.00,+DigitalVOX 1998.00,+DigitalVOX
1998.00,+DigitalVOX 1998.00,+DigitalVOX 1998.00,+DigitalVOX
1998.00,+DigitalVOX 1998.00,+DigitalVOX

(1) Could you tell me why I still got 14 responses at 1998.00 ms?

I guess I have a hard time figuring out how the responses of DigitalVox key
are recorded because, I think, if the responses are taken every time the
audio input reaches the threshold, there should be tens of responses with
different RTs, not the same RTs as I got.  (Maybe you have explained how it
works somewhere in the documentation but I simply missed it again!)

(2) I probably didn't synchronize my key press and my verbal production as I
thought I would.  But if subjects do make two responses at the same time,
can the computer record both of them simultaneously?  Or will it somehow
record them serially?

Honestly, I don't mind having tens of responses (like what I just
cut-and-pasted above) because I guess I can manually select the key press RT
(i.e. 2101.43, +K) and the first DigitalVOX RT (i.e.,1998.00, +DigitalVOX)
for later data analysis.  I would love to try your suggestion of using two
items, but since my study is a language task with motor-interference, I
don't really know how to split the item into two and still get response at
the same time....

Thanks again!
