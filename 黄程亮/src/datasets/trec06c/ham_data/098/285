Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc.

Symbol: OTC Pink Sheets: BMXG.PK
Industry: Biotechnology; Stem Cell Technologies
Current Price: 0.40

Projected Valuation: 3.50 per share

About the Company:

Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. is an innovative biotechnology R&amp;D compa=
ny, focused on the commercialization of new and groundbreaking stem cell t=
echnologies.  The Company has focused its initial efforts on the launch of=
 an innovative adult cryogenic stem cell bank which will store stem cell t=
issues for use in treatment of future diseases and ailments.  The Company =
plans to launch its initial cryogenic stem cell facilities in mid-2005, an=
d is additionally exploring opportunities for commercialization of new tec=
hnologies in tissue management, stem cell research instrumentation, and bi=
o-systems monitoring.  With impending establishment of an adult stem cell =
cryobank, research efforts at the forefront of the stem cell market, and e=
xperienced management team, we could see Bio-Matrix Scientific Group emerg=
e as the newest and most dynamic player in the explosive stem cell researc=
h market.

Investment Highlights:

Bio-Matrix Scientific is exceptionally well positioned at the forefront of=
 one of the most exciting new frontiers in biotechnology- stem cell resear=
ch, which has exploded since its inception a mere twenty years ago as a pa=
nacea for the treatment of degenerative disease.  While stem cell therapy =
is still a relatively new concept, expectations are almost universally pos=
itive, with research firm visiongain predicting that stem cell product rev=
enues will exceed 10 billion by 2013.  Recently, voters in California over=
whelmingly approved passage of Proposition 71, a landmark piece of legisla=
tion which provides 3 billion in stem cell funding over the next ten years=
, and will stimulate a stem cell research boom throughout the state.

With its initial focus on the establishment of stem cell cryogenic storage=
 facilities, Bio-Matrix is additionally well situated in a rapidly growing=
 and commercially successful market.  Until recently, this market has been=
 primarily limited to the cryogenic storage of cord blood tissues, used ma=
inly for bone marrow transplant procedures.  There are over 10 major cord =
blood banks in the world, preserving cells from more than 35,000 donors wi=
th average fees of 20,000 per patient- representing a total current market=
 of over 720 million.  As the public understanding of stem cells increases=
, and as additional stem cell therapies are developed, we believe that thi=
s niche market will enjoy exponential growth.  As it is the foremost stem =
cell banker focusing on the storage of adult stem cells, an unexplored but=
 lucrative market, we believe that Bio-Matrix stands to enjoy tremendous r=
evenue growth in the near-term period.

The Company benefits from a surprisingly strong (for a Pink Sheets Company=
) and experienced management team, who have combined financial acumen with=
 scientific savvy to offer a unique and promising model for growth in the =
stem cell market.  The Company=92s senior management team, helmed by David=
 Koos, PhD a 20 year veteran of investment banking, has extensive experien=
ce in capital financing and public company management, while its research =
efforts under the guidance of Dr. Philip Watts (PhD- Caltech) are intimate=
ly involved in the newest academic research into stem cell technologies.

Based solely on its stem cell cryogenic storage service, and without consi=
dering the potential top line impact of the Company=92s efforts in tissue =
management, stem cell instrumentation, and bio-systems monitoring, we anti=
cipate tremendous revenue growth for Bio-Matrix Scientific Group.  With la=
unch of its stem cell cryobank in mid-late 2005, we anticipate FY 2005 sal=
es of approximately 3.5 million, growing to over 24.7 million in 2006 and =
35 million in 2007 as medically-conscious consumers seek to avail themselv=
es of the promise of stem cell technologies.

Relative to a peer grouping of companies engaged in the stem cell research=
 and cryogenic tissue storage industries, who trade at an average price to=
 sales multiple of 8x, Bio-Matrix Scientific Group is prices at a steep di=
scount given its technology suite, management team, and sales expectations=
  By applying this comparative grouping=92s average P/R multiple to the C=
ompany=92s expected FY 2005 RPS of 0.44, we can arrive at a relative valua=
tion for Bio-Matrix of approximately 3.50 per share- a premium of almost 1=
000% from current levels.


From the Investor's Point of View: How arrived at our conclusions for BMXP=
:

A peer grouping of comparative stem cell storage and tissue management com=
panies currently trades at an average price to revenue multiple of 8x.  We=
 anticipate that Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. will distinguish itself=
 from these comparative companies with superior financial performance and =
revenue growth.  Therefore, on a forward looking basis and applying the co=
mparative grouping=92s average price to sales ratio to the Company=92s ant=
icipated FY 2005 revenues, we can therefore arrive at a relative valuation=
 for Bio-Matrix of approximately 3.50 per share; a nearly 10-fold increase=
 from current trading levels.
