Ultimately their patents will just mean that, for fear of possible
law suits, nobody apart from SUN will be using the results of their
research, but instead use innocent replacements. Using the latter
may even be an advantage, as in the present case.


The algorithm they try to patent sometimes gives a gross
overestimation of the zero set. For example, in BACKGROUND
[0018],[0019],[0064],[0065], one gets [-inf,inf] if A=B=0 notin C,
although the solution set is empty.
It seems that it is implicitly assumed that A is nonzero.

Their formulas also lead to overflow when B.sup^2 > realmax,
with very poor results if A=C=B/2 and B is huge.


In order to prevent that there will be a patent on similar
elementary tasks, I post a solution for the constraint propagation
on univariate quadratic expressions, with or without interval
coefficents. dvi,ps,and pdf versions can be downloaded from
the address given below; the latex original is attached here
to document that the paper was created today.

{\bf Abstract.} 

We present formulas for rigorous constraint propagation of
quadratic equality or inequality constraints involving a single
nonlinear variable. Since the analysis is very elementary, 
probably everything in here has been known for a long time.
The present approach, based on directed rounding only, provides 
efficient alternatives to the procedures discussed by 
{\sc Hansen \& Walster} \cite{HanW} (who only treat the solution
of a quadratic equation with interval coefficients, and treat 
incorrectly the case where the coefficient of the quadratic term 
contains numbers of both signs), which employ interval arithmetic.

In view of pending patent applications by these authors, 
who by these activities threaten to curb the freedom 
of research on interval methods, the following is explicitly stated:

Various modifications to the methods described will be readily apparent 
to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein 
may be applied to such modifications without departing from
the spirit and scope of the present methods. Thus, the present
methods are not intended to be limited to the formulas shown, but are
to be accorded the widest scope consistent with the principles and
features disclosed herein.
 
Notation is as in my book {\sc Neumaier} \cite{Neu.int}.

\section{Bounds for quadratic expressions} 

To find a rigorous upper bound on  
\[
u=\sup\,\{ax^2+bx \mid x \in \x\},
\]
we note that
\[
u=\max\,\{\ul x(a\ul x+b),\ol x(a\ol x+b)\},
\]
except in case that $ax^2+bx$ attains its global maximum in the
interior of $\x$.
This is the case iff $a<0$ and $t=-b/(2a)$ is in the interior of $\x$,
in which case $u=b^2/(-4a)$, attained at $t$. 

If $\ul x\ge0$, we get a rigorous upper bound in finite precision
arithmetic by computing with upward rounding as follows 
({\tt xl} = $\ul x$, {\tt xu} = $\ol x$):
\begin{verbatim}
  roundup;
  u=max(xl*(a*xl+b),xu*(a*xu+b));
  s=b/2; t=s/(-a);
  if t>xl, r=(-2*a)*xu;
    if r>b, u=max(u,s*t); end;
  end;
\end{verbatim}
With some extra analysis, it could be determined in most cases which
of the three cases is the worst case; however, if the unconstrained 
maximum of the quadratic is very close to a bound (or to both bounds),
two (or three) of the cases might apply due to uncertainty caused
by rounding errors.
 
\bigskip
Finding a rigorous enclosure for the interval  
\[
\c=\sup\,\{ax^2+bx \mid x \in \x,~ a \in \a,~ b\in \b\}
\]
can be reduced to the above for $\ul x \ge 0$, using
\[
\ol c = \sup\, \{\ol ax^2+\ol bx \mid x \in \x\},~~~
\ul c = -\sup\, \{-\ul ax^2-\ul bx \mid x \in \x\}.
\]
The case $\ol x\le0$ can be reduced to this by changing the sign of $x$,
and the general case by splitting $\x$ at zero if necessary.

\bigskip
Essentially the same analysis holds for rigorous upper bounds on
\[
u=\sup\Big\{~\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i x^i ~\Big|~ x \in \x~\Big\}
\]
and for rigorous enclosures of   
\[
\c=\sup\Big\{~\sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i x^i ~\Big|~ x \in \x,~ a\in\a~\Big\},
\]
except that finding the interior extrema is more involved.
It can be done with closed formulas for $n\le 5$ (though already 
$n=4$ is quite cumbersome and not recommended), and in general 
(recommended for $n>3$) using a root enclosure algorithm for the 
derivative, such as that in {\sc Neumaier} \cite{Neu.roots}.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Solving quadratic constraints} 

To find the set
\[
X=\{x \ge 0 \mid ax^2+2bx \ge c\},
\]
we proceed as follows. If $a=0$, the constraint is in fact linear,
and we have 
\[
X= \cases{
   \emptyset         & if $c>0$, $b\le 0$,\cr
   [0.5c/b,\infty]      & if $c>0$, $b>0$, \cr
   [0,0.5c/b]           & if $c\le 0$, $b<0$, \cr
   [0,\infty]        & if $c\le 0$, $b\ge 0$,
         }
\]
which can be nested such that only two compares are needed in any
particular case. For a rigorous enclosure in finite precision 
arithmetic, rounding must be downwards in the second case, 
and upwards in the third case.

If $a \ne 0$, the behavior is governed by the zeros
of the quadratic equation $ax^2+2bx-c=0$, given by
\[
t_1=\frac{-b-\sqrt{\Delta}}{a}=\frac{c}{b-\sqrt{\Delta}},~~~~~~~~~
t_2=\frac{-b+\sqrt{\Delta}}{a}=\frac{c}{b+\sqrt{\Delta}},
\]
where $\Delta:=b^2+ac$. If $\Delta\ge 0$, the zeros are real and 
the nonnegative zeros determine 
\[
X=\cases{
[0,\infty]\setminus~]t_1,t_2[ & if $a>0$,\cr
[0,\infty]\cap\,    [t_2,t_1] & if $a<0$.
        }
\]
Depending on the signs of $a$, $b$ and $c$ we find
\[
X=\cases{
  \emptyset                   & if $a< 0$, $b\le 0$, $c> 0$,\cr
  [0,-(c/z)]                  & if $a< 0$, $b\le 0$, $c\le 0$,\cr
  [0,z/(-a)]                  & if $a< 0$, $b\ge 0$, $c\le 0$,\cr
  [-((-c)/z),z/(-a)]          & if $a< 0$, $b\ge 0$, $c> 0$,\cr
  [0,-(c/z)]\cup[z/a,\infty]  & if $a> 0$, $b\le 0$, $c\le 0$,\cr
  [z/a,\infty]                & if $a> 0$, $b\le 0$, $c> 0$,\cr  
  [-((-c)/z),\infty]          & if $a> 0$, $b\ge 0$, $c> 0$,\cr
  [0,\infty]                  & if $a> 0$, $b\ge 0$, $c\le 0$,
       }
\]
where 
\[
z=|b|+\sqrt{\Delta}. 
\]
These formulas are numerically stable, and can be nested such that 
only three compares are needed in any particular case. 
(There are avoidable overflow problems for huge $|b|$, which can be 
cured by using for huge $|b|$ instead of $\sqrt{b^2+ac}$ the 
formula $|b|\sqrt{1+ac/b^2}$.)

Rigorous results in the presence of rounding errors are obtained if
lower bounds are rounded downwards, and upper bounds are rounded 
upwards. With the bracketing as given, this happens if in 
cases 2,5 and 6 all computations (including those of 
$\Delta=\sqrt{b^2+ac}$ and $z=|b|+\sqrt{\Delta}$) 
are done with rounding downwards, and in the other cases with rounding 
upwards. (However, this does {\bf not} hold for the version guarded 
against overflow, where further care is needed for the directed 
rounding of $\sqrt{\Delta}=|b|\sqrt{1+ac/b^2}$.)

If (the exact) $\Delta$ is negative, there is no real solution,
and $X$ is empty if $c>0$ and $[0,\infty]$ otherwise. 
The case when the sign of $\Delta$ cannot be determined due to rounding
errors needs special consideration. In the first and last case, 
the conclusion holds independent of the sign of $\Delta$, so that the 
latter need only be computed for cases 2--7. In the cases 2, 3, 6, and 7
we have $ac\ge 0$, so that $\Delta\ge 0$ automatically. 
This leaves cases 4 and 5. Now it is easily checked that with the 
recommended rounding and, in place of cases 4 and 5,
\[
X=\cases{
  \emptyset           & if $a< 0$, $b\ge 0$, $c> 0$, $\Delta< 0$,\cr
  [-((-c)/z),z/(-a)]  & if $a< 0$, $b\ge 0$, $c> 0$, $\Delta\ge 0$,\cr
  [0,-(c/z)]\cup[z/a,\infty]  
                      & if $a> 0$, $b\le 0$, $c\le 0$, $\Delta\ge 0$,\cr
  [0,\infty]          & if $a> 0$, $b\le 0$, $c\le 0$, $\Delta< 0$,
       }
\]
a rigorous enclosure is computed in all cases.

\bigskip
Finding the set
\[
X'=\{x \ge 0 \mid ax^2+2bx \in \c \mbox{ for some } a\in\a, b\in\b\}
\]
can be reduced to the previous task since
\[
X'=\{x \ge 0 \mid \ul a x^2+2\ul b x \le \ol c\} \cap
\{x \ge 0 \mid \ul a x^2+2\ul b x \le \ol c\}.
\]
The sets
\[
X''=\{x \in \x_0 \mid ax^2+2bx \ge c\}
\]
and
\[
X'''=\{x\in\x_0 \mid ax^2+2bx \in\c \mbox{ for some } a\in\a, b\in\b\}
\]
can be obtained by intersecting the result of the above tasks with 
$\x_0$ if $\ul x_0\ge0$, by negating $x$, $\x_0$, and $\b$ if 
$\ol x_0\le 0$, and by splitting $\x_0$ at zero if $0$ is in the 
interior of $\x_0$. By modifying the code appropriately, one can 
also avoid computing roots which can be seen to lie outside $\x_0$.

\bigskip
With minor changes, these formulas also apply for strict inequalities 
and interior enclosures. Also, it is clear that polynomial inequalities
and inclusions of interval polynomials can be solved by a 
straightforward adaptation of the above arguments.
