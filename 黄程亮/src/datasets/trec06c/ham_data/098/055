Hi.

I was wondering what the default duration for feedback was. Is it in the 
documentation somewhere and have I just missed it?

Is it still the case that feedback durations may be a bit variable as 
mentioned in the help files

>While theoretically you could leave the feedback enabled as it should have 
>a constant display interval I don't think it's ever been put to the acid 
>test and who knows what you'd have to do with the delay value:

Also, does the last bit of the sentence above mean that feedback display 
times can interact with delay times somehow?

Thanks

- Mike
