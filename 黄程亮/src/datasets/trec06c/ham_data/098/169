Hmmm.... let me play devil's advocate:
It brings up an interesting question of standards for
original work for publication.  Presumably computing the
roots of interval polynomials was previously
published as a research publication.  An algorithm or procedure
might possibly be derivable by any of us;  nonetheless, a
clear, readable written record of it could still be valuable
to all, and writing it down in a clear and understandable
way may take some effort.  So, although it may not be surprising
and although any of a number of us might have been able to derive it
in a fairly straightforward way, might the written record still be
valuable to the community as a whole?

Best regards,

Baker
