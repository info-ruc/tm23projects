Dear prof. Kearfott, Demmel and Jiawang Nie,

thank you very much for your prompt reply.

I am afraid I was not very clear in the description of the problem.
Indeed, my objective is NOT the accurate evaluation of the exact range =
of the polynomial. Instead I am looking for an approach that gives me =
information about where the region of minimum variability of the =
function is located. To this aim, it is enough for me that the =
overestimation of the united extension is the minimum in the interval =
wherein the function shows the lowest sensitivity. Note that it is =
enough to know that we have THERE the minimum overestimation with =
respect to the overestimation obtained for the interval of the same =
width, but centered in any other point.

Note that the range I look for may not to be coincident with a =
minimum/maximum of the function f(x). If the amplitude of the united =
extension f(X(k)) is w(f(X(k)))=3Dmax(f(X(k)))-min(f(X(k))), we are =
looking for the X(k) to which corresponds the minimum w(f(X(k))). That =
is the region of minimum variability.

Now, I was trying an interval extension F(X(k)) of f(x) on the interval =
X(k) such that w(F(X(k))) had the same behaviour of w(f(X(k))). In =
particular that w(F(X(k))) was minimum just where w(f(X(k))) was, even =
if w(F(X(k)))>> w(f(X(k))).

Actually, using the Taylor Model of f as interval extension =
(F_TM(X(k))), i.e. by using the complete Taylor series of f(x) around =
x0(k) and estimating it in terms of interval variable, I have verified =
that w(F(X(k))) keeps the presence of local and absolute minima just =
where local and absolute minima of w(f(X(k))) are. In particular it is =
true for a generic parabola and for all the polynomials that I have =
randomly obtained (from 3rd to 9th order). Moreover this characteristic =
is maintained for all delta, i.e. both tight and wide interval.

I think improbable that these are only coincidences, rather I'm looking =
for a justification to this behaviour in the properties of the Taylor =
Model.
Can you help me about this topics? May this result be extended to any =
polynomial function? Are there some theorems about this?

I have not found a precise reference to this topic in literature, but I =
am afraid I am not searching for in the right way. I am sure that you =
can address me in the right way.

At the best of your knowledge, is somewhere anyone who has been =
interested in the region of minimum w(f(X(k))) rather than the minimum =
of f(X(k)), or the best inclusion of the function?

Do you think that the use of TM is valid or suggest alternatives to me?

Thanks in advance

Patrizia Lamberti
