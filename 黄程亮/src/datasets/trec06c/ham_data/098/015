Dear Friends, 

Once again, many thanks to the organizers to the international
Workshop on Reliable Engineering Computing (Savannah, Georgia,
September 15-17, 2005), especially to Rafi L. Muhanna and 
Robert L. Mullen, Workshop Co-Chairs. 

This workshop was a great success. Overall, 24 papers by 35 speakers
were presented, and 45 registered participants actively participated
in the workshop. 

This workshop was made possible through the sponsorship of the 
National Science Foundation (NSF), the Computing and Systems
Technology (CAST) Division of the American Institute
of Chemical Engineers (AIChE), the Society for Risk Analysis, Sun
Microsystems, and the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Coordination of the event was provided by the Center for Reliable
Engineering Computing at Georgia Tech Savannah.

The workshop presentations are posted on the workshop website 
http://www.gtrep.gatech.edu/rec/recworkshop/
The international journal Reliable Computing is planning to publish a
special issue with extended versions of the presented papers. 

At the working meeting, all the participants agreed that this workshop 
was a great start, and that it is desirable to hold such workshops on
a regular biannual basis. Drs. Muhanna and Mullen kindly volunteered
to organize the next workshop in Savannah, Georgia, in 2006. Based on
the requests of participants from different countries, it looks like
end of February 2006 is the best time for the next workshop. 

To attract even more engineers to our meetings, the participants
decided that it would be beneficial to have a subtitle clarifying the
workshop's topic, so the next workshop will be a workshop on Reliable
Engineering Computing: Uncertainty in Engineering Computations. 

The participants also agreed that it would be a great idea to keep a
list of open problems related to reliable engineering
computing. Dr. Mullen kindly agreed to serve as a contact point for
possible problem and to post the overview of the resulting open
problem on the website of the Center for Reliable
Engineering Computing. Please send suggestions, ideas, and problems 
to Robert L. Mullen at Robert.Mullen@case.edu
