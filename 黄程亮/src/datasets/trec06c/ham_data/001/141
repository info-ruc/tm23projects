<DIV>Hello, </DIV>=0D
<DIV>It is with heartfelt hope that I write to seek<BR>
yourco-operation and assistance in the content<BR>
stated below. I am Mr.Frank Shencovic, an accountact.<BR>
I<BR>
am the personal account advicer to my late boss , An<BR>
American; who was a contractor, and a businessman. </DIV>=0D
<DIV>On the 30th day of October 1999, my client, his wife<BR>
and their three&nbsp; children were involved in a car<BR>
accident in which all occupants of the&nbsp; vehicle died. </DIV>=0D
<DIV>My Boss deposited as family belongings in the sum of<BR>
Fifteen&nbsp; million British Pounds only (15,000.000.00)<BR>
with the hope of transferring&nbsp; it to his country as<BR>
soon as his contract expires.Since his death I have <BR>
made severalenquiries to his embassy to locate any of<BR>
my Boss extended&nbsp; relatives, but this attempt so far<BR>
has been unsuccessful. </DIV>=0D
<DIV>After these several unsuccessful attempts I decided<BR>
to look for a foreigner&nbsp; who is willing to help claim<BR>
this fund, hence I contacted you. The intention&nbsp; right<BR>
now is for you to stand as the Next of Kin of my<BR>
deceased Boss. This&nbsp; becomes imperative as the bank<BR>
just gave me ten official working days to&nbsp; provide<BR>
one, or the money will be declared dormant in<BR>
accordance with the&nbsp; bank's policy. All legal<BR>
documents to aid your claim this fund and to prove<BR>
your<BR>
&nbsp;relationship with the deceased will be arranged.<BR>
Your help will be&nbsp; appreciated with 30% of the total<BR>
sum. </DIV>=0D
<DIV>All I require is your honest co-operation. I guarantee<BR>
that this will be&nbsp; executed under a legitimate<BR>
arrangement that will protect you from any&nbsp; breach of<BR>
the law. Please accept my apologies, keep my<BR>
confidence and disregard this email if you do not<BR>
appreciate this proposition I have&nbsp; offered you.<BR>
Further more, Kindly furnish me with your following<BR>
details: <BR>
{A}. YOUR FULL NAME. <BR>
{B}. YOUR RESIDENTIAL AND OFFICE ADDRESSES. <BR>
{C}. YOUR TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBER. <BR>
(D) A VALID COPY OF IDENTITY </DIV>=0D
<DIV>However, if you wish to help me actualize this, do get<BR>
back to me so that I will detail you more</DIV>=0D
