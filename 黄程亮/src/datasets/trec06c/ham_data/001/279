just a little more evidence that suns suck.
when the 670mps came out, i remember doing a fork test
on a vax 11/780 running xinu and the sun running sunos4.1.xx.
the sun as i remember was about 10x as slow as the vax,
and it was even slower if the child process touched memory.

and the 11/780 is a 1 mip machine.
