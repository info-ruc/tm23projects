| I'm really hesitant to bring this up...  but the main barrier to me to

| bones, in something like a real programming language.  

At Usenix Rob was kind enough to let me play with acme (running on a
laptop pc) for a while, and it seemed like acme is sufficiently
extensible to be able to do most of the interesting things that are
attractive about emacs.  It was pretty impressive, really.

Acme is extensible by using external agents, more like XEDIT and REXX
under VM/CMS than like emacs, actually.  So if someone ports a Scheme
interpreter to Plan 9, who needs elisp? :-)
