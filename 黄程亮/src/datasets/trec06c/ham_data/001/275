	Just for fun, I ran the following program on a machine running SunOS and on a
	machine running Plan 9 (with obvious alterations to get it to compile.)
	I was hoping to see Plan 9 go faster, but they took about the same time
	(10 seconds on a Sparcstation I).
	...

I just did that on an SS-1000 running SunOS 5.2, and it took 17.3 seconds.
