Some people wanted the postscript version of nofileserver.ms.
I have it groff'ed and saved in .ps, so people who want copies
of nofileserver.ps, please email me and I will send it out to you.

The size is: 63013 bytes of postscript.

Nofileserver.ms describes in detail how to set up plan9 if you do not
have the standard hardware described in the release notes, to wit: you
have no sparc's or MIPS machines.  The authors give detail on how to
set up plan9 using stand alone PC's, or unix boxes.
