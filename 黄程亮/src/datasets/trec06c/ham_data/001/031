I have all the old documents including all the dist/plan9docs and the
dist/plan9man printed out.  These are slightly old to say the least.
Then I went to plan9.att.com and via anon-ftp got some more files,
which seemed to be newer and more upto date than the ones on
research.att.com.  These files, however, are in a .ms format, which
doesn't seem to be liked by our IRIX nroff -ms.  It just prints
some sort of format, but it is not very good.  What I am interested
in is postscript format or straight ascii of these docs. Especially
nofileserver.ms - which details how to get a plan 9 system up on
a stand alone machine.  Any help, pointers, whatever would be appreciated.
Also, do any plan 9 sites have a guest login of some sort so I can test
it out.  I have managed to coerce our faculty into asking for a licence
and the CD from ATT ;) so expect to see a new plan 9 system coming
up soon at a site near you.  Might take a while as I wrangle for
a 486 machine with sufficient disk.

Can you use rlogin/telnet into a plan 9 system? In short, will it work
over a modem/vt100 combo or will I have to set up PPP/SLIP.

Go plan9
