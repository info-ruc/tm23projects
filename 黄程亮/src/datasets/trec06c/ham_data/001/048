| hey, unicode has a gajillion space characters to choose from,

But it is the one that 8.5 connects to my spacebar. :-)

| get with the program, mon.

Ouch.  I know about the funny spaces, but I'm uncertain what the
program is.  Why doesn't isspace() recognise them, for example?  When
awk goes to split input into fields, I can see why one might not want
it to split on the non-breaking-space or the graphic-for-space, but
what about the others?
