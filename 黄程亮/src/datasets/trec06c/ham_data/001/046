One of the features of plan 9 is that, thanks to unicode, people with
non-ascii names can have their real names as their login names.  But
that isn't the whole story.  Some people have spaces in their names.
Ursula K. Le Guin should be able to log in as ``Le Guin'', but since
ascii space is disallowed in filenames, she couldn't have the right
home directory.  That's kind of a shame.
