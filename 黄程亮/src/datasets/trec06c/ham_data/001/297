The script given in nofileserver.ps (fixit) that will change the Fxxx and 
Dxxx names to the real thing doesn't work under awk (dies on the ?:) 
Under nawk:
	on the SGI Crimson - no output
	on the Sun Sparcserver (solaris 2.2) all it prints out is a huge 
number of blank lines.  Anyone got a working fixit script?  Or some other 
way of generating the correct file names?

I have downloaded the CD onto a disk served by a HP, accessed from both 
the Crimson and the SparcServer.
