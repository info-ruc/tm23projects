some consider p9 emacs man page ["this page intentionally left blank"]
to be one of the most profound documents of the recent computing
literature. it says all there is to say.

emacs is an artifact of a computing world in which most programs cannot
be used together to compose other, more interesting work environments.
in that world, editors have at best a mediocre interface to outside
systems, so anything resembling a uniform environment is possible only 
by laboriously re-creating the outside world within the editor. of course,
this re-creation requires a "special" extension language so that the
labor can be transferred to the unsuspecting users, who appearently see
nothing wrong in their remarkable inability to utilize what is already
out there. "oh, we can just program emacs to do that..." sigh.

an alternative to this opeque, incoherent and incompatible world is to
create a transparant, consistent, highly composable environment in which
the "editor" blends into the environment and is naturally extensible by it.
p9 and acme [1] are attempts in that direction, also see oberon [2] for the
implementation details of another such system.

hope this helps.
