Oh god, I think the earth moved for me.
I am drumming up support for plan 9 here, but when I say it
doesn't run emacs, people lose all interest and the weird thing
is that after about 2 weeks of running sam, I would hate to go
back to emacs, and I am a die hard emacs/vi fan.  But most people
don't seem to be willing to take the time to learn sam properly.
People I showed sam to... oh whats the point.

The compatibility list seems to be working, I got some mail about
it, so people, if you have PC's running plan 9, mail me your
configuration/hardware specs and get them incorporated into the
list.
