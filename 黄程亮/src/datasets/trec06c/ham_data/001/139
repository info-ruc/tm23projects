Reason 1:  bitmap fonts.  They have two disadvantages.  First, they
only come in a few inflexible sizes.  I miss NeWS, where fonts were
nice scalable postscript objects. Second, they are hard to read.
(Especially on a 640x480 screen!) If pixmaps were used, the glyphs
could be anti-aliased, with grey pixels smoothing out the jaggies.  To
see what a big difference this makes in apparent resolution, look at
the output of a recent version of xdvi.  It's not a frill, but a
qualitative improvement in, well, quality.
