>From Unixgram X, a copyrighted paragon of fleet street/tabloid/nat'l
enquirer muck-raking:

they are negotiating with an unidentified company to bring the system
up on a new machine where they don't have to worry about compatibility.
Hints and inferences of cable-tv info-superhighway, the box on top of your
TV set, etc, as well as remote portable systems.
