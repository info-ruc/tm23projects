Hi,
is all that's required to bring up a machine as a cpuserver;
 	- enter "auth/adduser -h -p newmachinename" from an
	  authentication server.(then give newmachine a password)

	- enter the newmachine into cpurc

	- enter the changes of newmachine in /lib/ndb/local and
	  run mk again??

Anything else? (Hope I remembered all the changes. Keep getting
"authentication failed"). We've got an ipx that's been used as a terminal
fine, but has been fighting the idea of changing to a cpuserver. ;)
(The fs and other cpu/auth server are sparc2's).


AND, how might I get the pwd into my prompt? I know it's kind of
weenie, but I'm used to it! TIA. Regards, --Jerry
