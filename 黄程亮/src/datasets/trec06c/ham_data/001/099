Alas, that was my call; I've put the RFD for comp.os.plan9
out a couple of times. The first time I couldn't really
follow it up, as thesis work intervened. Both times the
response didn't justify proceeding to a vote. I had a number
of enthusiatic responses via e-mail - but you need 100 more
YES votes than NO votes, and there's a hard core of people who
vote NO to everything that they aren't personally interested.

I didn't want the group to fail, and I don't want to create an
alt group (given that Plan 9 really does deserve it's own Big
7 group). I figure I'll wait until after USENIX before bringing
it up; who knows? If the folks from Bell publish Plan 9, then
we'll probably have trouble _not_ getting a comp.os.plan9 - look
at the interest in that astoundingly mediocre and uninteresting
Linux thing.

Geoff.
