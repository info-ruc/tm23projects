Subject: Re: prices for Entre PCs
	[too expensive for our taste]

The only options available are 1) to wait till summer. We will be doing a
new rfp and awarding the contract to a mainstream player yet to be decided.
2) bid something they don't have. I just got in a pentium a few weeks ago
because they weren't selling them at the time, or 3) Look at buying a
machine that is officially supported by something like nextstep or
solaris and state on the requisition you are planning to run that OS
---cut

I have approval to get 4 machines but the local dealer with wich we have 
a contract with is gouging us, so to get out of the coils, we have to get 
machines that are NeXTSTEP/Solaris certified, and most of these machines 
come with weird mainstream cards.  I need your help in getting a list of 
video cards that work.  I am not that good (yet) with intel hardware and 
would prefer the minimum of problems getting it up to run first.

So if you have any YES - This card runs, please mail me it.  I would 
really love if the ATI UltraPro or something like that worked.  Diamond 
is not too well liked here so thats out.  I was hoping for something like 
the list of supported cards direct from the horses mouth so to speak.

The only NeXTSTEP machine that has ET4000/W32 etc chipset is the NEC 
Image series, which are not as much bang for the buck as Gateway 2000 or 
the other clones.  I know Compaq Qvision probably won't work, so we can't 
get the Compaq Deskpro's. (Local bus is good)

Any idea what hardware the plan9 folks are running (x86).
