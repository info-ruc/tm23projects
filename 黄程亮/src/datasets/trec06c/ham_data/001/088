What does a gnot win you?  We're working at putting together
the ideal terminal using a PC.

At the moment, we've got a 486, we boot with tftp, and have 1600x485x2
resolution using Diamond Stealth Pro graphics card.  Presently we're
using a 17" monitor (which is usable).  We'd like to get a look at a 21"
grey-scale screen.  Eizo has one (Aus$2800) but there's no local
distributor at the moment so we haven't seen it yet.  

Has anyone else seen any grey-scale screens around?

Any other ideas on best machine for a terminal?  We want something
already supported by Plan 9, cheapish, with a nice high-res display for
large help(1) windows.
