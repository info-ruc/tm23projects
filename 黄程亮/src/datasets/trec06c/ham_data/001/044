Ok, I just got a letter written up and signed, requesting the plan 9
licence and CD-ROM and am sending it to Neera Kuckreja today.
My question is: How long does it take for the licence and CD-ROM 
to show up?
The letter is on the official letterhead, + signed by a faculty member.
Would they need anything else?  Eg, photocopy of Faculty ID or something?
