Ok, Forsyth has this exact setup up and running.  I can send out the
war story of his if you want.

Re: Market. I am not sure if going commercial with plan 9 will change
anything any more.  I wish it would, for then I would not have to
program or manage MS-Windows/X11 et al. when I go out to work.
The fact that I am paying for college by adminstrating large unix
boxen is annoying enough as it is.

Plan 9 is very nice but I am not sure if it can make it commercially.
MS-Windows: the stuff nightmares are made up out of.
