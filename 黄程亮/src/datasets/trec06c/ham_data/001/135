acme is a better emacs than emacs, because it uses the mouse
fully, and is a _tool_ that other programs can use, rather
than a monolith.

I can understand being disappointed with losing emacs and getting
sam, as an integrated environment is a good thing.  But when you
compare apples with apples, you'll be happy you switched to plan 9
and acme.
