Just for fun, I ran the following program on a machine running SunOS and on a 
machine running Plan 9 (with obvious alterations to get it to compile.)
I was hoping to see Plan 9 go faster, but they took about the same time
(10 seconds on a Sparcstation I).  Has anyone done more thoughtful
benchmarks comparing the two kinds of systems?
  
/*
#include <u.h>
#include <libc.h>
#define exit exits
*/

main() 
{
  int i;
  for (i=0; i<1000; ++i) {
    if (fork()) {
      wait(0);
    } else {
      exit(0);
    }
  }
}

P.S.  reason #2 why plan 9 is not my favorite operating system "vc, xc, etc".
given that you will usually use an mkfile most of the time anyway, 
why not name them something sensible like "sparc-cc, mips-cc, etc-cc"?
