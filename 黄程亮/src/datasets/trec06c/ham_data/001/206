Ok, I am writing up a spec for the machines we are going to buy. Anyone 
(forsyth, capell, waldbauer, the good folks reading this at plan9.att.com 
etc) have any recommendations as to what sort of local bus card I should 
spring for? I know ET4000 localbus works, are there any others that work 
better/faster? Most people are trying to sell us Diamond pro or ATI.
I know diamond cards work, (capell), but in our licensing agreement, it 
says you can't export code outside the country and capell et al are in 
Australia.  Or are the diffs/changes not subject to the agreement?
I would like to get the Diamond cards or ATI's if possible.
(As you can see, I am not too familiar with the PC hardware side of 
things, I do most of my work on unix workstations/servers).
