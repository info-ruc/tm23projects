I just tried it, and it runs twice as fast (around 8 seconds) if I
statically link.  Plan 9 on a lowly sparc ELC runs the test in about
4 secs -- twice as fast again!

I heard some rumor about fork on Solaris taking 1/10th of a second
around the time that we got the SS-1000s, but perhaps this was
fixed in a later release of Solaris.
