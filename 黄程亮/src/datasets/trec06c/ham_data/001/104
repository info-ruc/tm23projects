I'd like to suggest that, the next time you put out an RFD,
you proselytize a little more aggressively.  I'm *very* interested
in comp.os.plan9, and have been quite surprised that there isn't
one already.  I'd vote yes (early and often, being from Chicago),
but I've never seen the RFD.  Perhaps you could put out the RFD
to a wider audience, certainly including this mailing list, and
maybe including comp.os.linux.misc, comp.sys.notebook, etc.
I'd think that many of the people who are interested in Linux
(c'mon now, running a more or less full-blown UNIX on something
that you can carry around in your backpack is hardly completely
devoid of interest...) would be interested in Plan 9 as well, ne?

I've saved an 80Mb partition to load Plan 9 onto on my notebook...
but haven't had the time to figure out what to do to get it up
and running...  Somehow having a little box that weighs 5lb and
that can boot and run Linux, MSDOS (if you must) *and* Plan 9
appeals greatly to my geekly leanings. :-)
