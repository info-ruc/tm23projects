We just got in our licence agreement in today, got it checked out, signed 
and ready to send back to Bell Labs tomorrow.  More to the point, I also 
got funding and approval to spend about $20000 in purchasing some PCs and 
want the input from the people on the list as to what sort of hardware 
would you recommend?  If the maintainer of the comptability list got some 
uncompatible hardware... talk about egg on face.

Specifically, CD-ROM - Should I pony up for an UltraStor 14F + ext. CDROM 
or are there better alternatives available? (This leads to a chicken and 
Egg problem. Forsyth has written the 14F drivers, but how to use them 
without having a running plan 9 system first? heh) 

Any horror stories, caveats, bring em up now and they'll go into the list.
excuse my babbling, finally something has crystallized.
