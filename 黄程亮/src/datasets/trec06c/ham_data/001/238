    | I've been using this exclusively for about a year.

    Me too, except its emacs for news and xterm for talk. :-)

Ah, perhaps it's time for me to tidy up gtalk and make it available.
It's an interface I wrote for talk a while back built on top of
libXg/libtext.  It hasn't got bells and whistles but if there's
interest I can put it up.

For those who are interested I've found some time to look at 9term.
I'm tidying that up (and I've hopefully fixed the echo problem...) and
trying to nail down David Hogan to add 9wm compatibility.  Gary (and
others) have been asking me about chording too so I've at least thought
about it.  So there should be a new 9term bundle out soon.  Now's the
time to nag me again about the bugs you've been wanting fixed.  ;-)
