This brings up a point.  Editors on plan9.  Sam is very nice, no doubt,
I've built it on our systems and installed it and now use it exclusively
when at school, but not having access to a SLIP line, can't really use sam
from home except with sam -d, which is not as convenient as using vi or
even, dare I say it, emacs.  What I hope someone can help with, is running
plan9 over a modem without slip, as the TERM program does for linux,
allowing a dialout to an annex box from a home linux box, rlogging into
the main system and running term, which allows X to go over the modems
without SLIP.  Now THAT would make life much easier. 

There are very many vt220/240/100 terminals out there and I don't expect
them to go away very soon, wish plan 9 had better support for them.
I guess a 386sx minimal system running plan9 and 8.5 would do the trick
but I am not sure if plan9 has term or something similar.
