Subject: rumours of plan 9 going commercial

For some reason various people on this list have been
floating rumours about plan 9 going commercial.  I think
this is ludicrous.  At best, wishful thinking; at worst,
confusing to others on the list.

I don't think Plan 9 has any real chance of going commercial.
First of all, the entrenched momentum of the Unix/X11 and
DOS/Windows markets is too great.  I am essentially the
only person here who uses Plan 9; I have tried to find
other recruits, but between a shortage of hardware and the
"what do you mean it doesn't have EMACS?" syndrome, it is
an uphill battle.

Secondly, remember AT&T sold USL to Novell.  I think this
makes it clear that AT&T doesn't really want to be in the
business of selling operating systems.

So basically, forget it.

However, I think Rob Pike has said that they are trying
to get Plan 9 publicly released.  I assume he means as
free software along the lines of awk or sam.  I believe
this is the only way Plan 9 will ever have a chance to see
the widespread use it deserves, and so I hope very much
that this happens.
