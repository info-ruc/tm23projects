Seeing the overwhelming response to my nofileserver.ps offer, I am
hoping to get deluged likewise with requests to sell me a Gnot ;)
Actually, I was wondering if any Gnots are available commercially.
And please, no sun 3/50's.  I want the Gnot.

Now onto some more questions:

There was a post about creating comp.os.plan9.  What happened?

I think I saw somewhere that plan 9 was going to go primetime,
i.e, commercial.  Any people in the know able to confirm/deny?
