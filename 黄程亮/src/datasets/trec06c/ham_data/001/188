I thought Brazil was the CD ROM distribution that is already out the door.

I'm fairly sure that I was being told about post-Brazil things (better
networking including a working IP multiplexor, PPP and NFS, colour support
and better graphics models, bug fixes, a more solid 486 port) when
I was at USENIX, but then my memory is notoriously flakey.
