There were over 40 newsgroups that `could have been relevant' to
a RFD for Plan 9. I'd rather not launch a huge campaign, as OS
evangelism is a fairly irritating behavior (even when you are
running the |<00L3St 0S in the whole wide world :-).

I should have sent the RFD to this list, but I was planning
to do that only if there was a reasonable support from the rest of
the net - after all, if all the support we got was from users of the
mailing list, why not just stay with the mailing list? Still as an
experiment: if you're reading this list, and you'd go to the trouble
of voting on comp.os.plan9, mail me and let me what you'd vote (and
if you'd vote `no', then what your reasons are).

Support from the people at the Labs is another issue. I would think
a newsgroup would reduce the amount of support mail to the Labs, if
there was a decent FAQ there and people could post answers about getting
Plan 9 up and running.

There's also a the fact that of traffic on this list being hardly
overwhelming (these last couple weeks are an exception).

>I've saved an 80Mb partition to load Plan 9 onto on my notebook...

Perhaps this should be our first FAQ? PC configuration type stuff?

(I await answers to gary's pc file server question  with interest).
