Not sure what sort of system you're setting up.  If you're running
the PC standalone, you work AT the PC.  If you're using the PC
as a terminal, connected to CPU server/file server, you'd be connected
with ethernet.  There _is_ a SLIP stream module written here
that seems to work, I was using that to connect from home.

You won't need a huge amount of disk space, I have a 120M partition
for Plan9, and that's heaps, probably 60 would be ample, (but don't
quote me on that) (but that's without full source).

I've been busy playing with getting it working with a bootp boot prom,
and using a Stealth Pro graphics card to get 1600x985 screen (essential
or at least very nice for using help) and now have quite an OK terminal.

Good luck getting things up and running (afraid I won't be able to
help you much there, wasn't involved getting things started here).
