This message has three functions.

1) To see if I got subscribed to the list. So if anyone sees this,
   mail me back.  I don't care if I get flooded, life is slow right
   about now ;).

2) If you see this, and I am not properly subscribed, please tell me
   how to go about it.

3) Anyone have any experiences in installing plan 9 on 80386 machines?

thanks,

vijay gill (vijay@umbc.edu)
