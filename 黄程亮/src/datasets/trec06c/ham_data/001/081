Anyone interested in getting comp.os.plan9 should read read the "How to
Create a New Usenet Newsgroup" faq.  The URL is:

ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet-by-group/news.groups/How_to_Create_a_New_Usenet_Newsgroup

In general, somebody needs to draft up a Request For Comments, including a
proposed charter of the new newsgroup and make it available.  Then, if
there's any interest out in net land, have a vote.  

I haven't seen a RFC for comp.os.plan9, so I assume nobody has gone this
far.  If nobody else steps forward, I could write up a RFC.

I am interested in knowing this as well.
