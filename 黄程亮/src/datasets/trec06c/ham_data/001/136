   acme is a better emacs than emacs, because it uses the mouse
   fully, and is a _tool_ that other programs can use, rather
   than a monolith.

Sounds good for mouse exploiters.

But what if I don't want to use the damn mouse?  Call me neanderthal,
but I'm not willing to slow my work down by a factor of 2 to use a
mouse.  Does acme support alt/control/shift key bindings?

(For reference, I touch the mouse maybe 5 times a day... all my
Xwindow focus, open, iconify, etc. are bound to key sequences.)

I'm not in love with emacs... in fact I detest many aspects of it, but
it's far better than all the other tools I have available... and it
lives on all the machines I have to use.
