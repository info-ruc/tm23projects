You mentioned Diamond graphic cards - my question is: do you have drivers
for them thar cards? I am still trying to put together a list of supported
hardware configurations and so far, haven't gotten very far.

Any help will be appreciated.  I plan on setting up and maintaining
a list of known hardware that works, making life easier on others who
will not have to go through this over and over
