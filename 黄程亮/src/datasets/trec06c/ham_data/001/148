there's a background project here to do some scaling font stuff.
we may use them one day, if the results are good enough, on our
higher-resolution (>130 dpi) monitors.  you need the higher res.
the problem is that antialiased fonts are often poor for day-to-day
use because their fuzziness bothers the eye.  programs like nEwS (or
your favorite pOSTsCRIPT interpreter, for different reasons)
try not to use scaled fonts when they can, but rather refer to
precompiled rasterized, hand-tuned, unfuzzy fonts.  the results
are faster, sharper, more pleasing, and easier on the eye.
