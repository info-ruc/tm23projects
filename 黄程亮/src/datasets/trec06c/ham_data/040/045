When you do pointer arithmatic, you work in increments of what the
  pointer points to. So if you have a pointer to an int, as in the above
  example, when you add one to it, you actually make it point to the
  next int, not the next byte or word. 

This is so that you can have an array of something and move a pointer
  through the array by ioncrementing it without having to pay 
  attention to how big your array elements are.

If you want to point to the low byte of x, you might be able to do
  something like this:

  int x;
  char * p; /*this assumes that a char is one byte*/

  p = &x;
  p++;

Be warned that that is pretty non-portable code. What it actually does
  depends on how big int and char are with the specific
  compiler/machine combination, and details like byte ordering within
  words.

The above all applies to "normal" C. I'm not exactl sure how IC would
  handle it.
