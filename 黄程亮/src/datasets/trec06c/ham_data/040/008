  Hi Gary,
        I haven't used ICC with the HB but I do use it with the miniboard.
I've had good luck with dlm which I believe is available from the HB site.
Karl Lunt (who wrote the brilliant SBasic compiler for the 6811) has a
version of motorola's PCBug with modified timing routines for faster
machines at:

http://www.seanet.com/~karllunt/projects.htm

Also, Jim Fong (EAS) has a downloader on his site that I haven't tried.
It's called
DL68hc11 (for some reason!) and can be had at:

   Hope this helps, Duncan
