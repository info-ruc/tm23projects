The most common causes would probably be:  (1) Not having a transducer hooked up when the ping is initiated; (2) Having the flat flex cable plugged in backwards (you can't trust the stripe to be on the correct side!  Make sure pin 1 goes to ground and pin 9 goes to V+); and (3) Too high a voltage to the sonar module (perhaps it's not being regulated properly).  Of course, chips sometimes just die for no apparent reason.  Good luck!

Wendy Parson,      I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
Will Bain,                      I want to achieve it through not dying.
