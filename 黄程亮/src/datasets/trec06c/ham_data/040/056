I'm beginning the research phase of a robot to work in zero gravity,
where obviously shaft encoders would be useless (and the grid becomes
3-dimensional, ouch!). My replacement idea right now is tiny beacons,
maybe IR, that would give the robot an idea of its current location. I
know that alot of current production robots use radio beacons, but
that's a little too much radio noise for this purpose.
	Anyway, there are alternatives to shaft encoders, especially if it's
travelling in a confined space. Shaft encoders, however, are definitly
the cheapest and simplest. I wish I could use them!
