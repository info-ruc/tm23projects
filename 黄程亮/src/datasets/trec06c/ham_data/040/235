I'm very sorry I couldn't make it to class this week; Harvard is on spring
break and I'm on the west coast.  I hope the groups formed in my absence
don't exclude the musical jungle gym because I think it's a viable and
very interesting idea.  A simple metal climbng structure should be
relatively inexpensive and easy to find (any leads or connections would be
appreciated).  Saul has begun to show me some of the pieso-electrics
needed for the stress sensors; and the java interface to the crickets that
i've been playing with seems like a decent way to write the music
software. I've gotten three people from the class to volunteer to help
with some aspects; I just don't know whether decisions were made on
Tuesday that I should know about.  Is a group around this project still
possible?

If I don't hear from anyone, I'll see you all on the 6th.

Peace,

Jason
