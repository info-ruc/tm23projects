DOING!  Yeah, now that you mention it, I had the same problem when I got my HB.  Took me about a week before I got around to trying COM1.  That fixed it, so I left it that way and forgot about it long ago.  At the time, no one on the list had any helpful suggestions for me, either.

Anyone else out there had problems using COM2 with a serial mouse on COM1?
