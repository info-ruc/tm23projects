 Hi Becky,

         If you are using the HB with the expansion board, you *do* need
new library files loaded. Check the web site at:

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/hbexp30/software
.html

The easiest way to run new library files is to edit lib_hb.lis to include
them.

To test the HB inputs w/o the expansion board, run Fred's hbtest.c
(included in the IC distribution) and follow the instructions in the
assembly manual. I posted a slightly modified version of this code to the
list for testing the expansion board inputs. Let me know if you want it and
I'll mail it to you directly.

Hope this helps, Duncan
