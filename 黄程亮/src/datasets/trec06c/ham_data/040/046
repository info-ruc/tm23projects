Hello, I am working on an autonomous mobile robot.  Which has a sonar and
infared sensor incorporated into it.  Right now it can avoid objects, by
sensing it and backing up and turning.  I want my robot to take the
information from the sensors and map out the terrain.  I want to know if
anyone has an algorithm for mapping the terrain.  The coding doesn't
matter, I can transform it into code I can use.
