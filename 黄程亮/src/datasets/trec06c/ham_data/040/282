Hello all -

I have created a website to archive the traffic generated on the Handy
Board mailing list.  It is currently not updating in real-time, but will
start updating automatically as soon as Fred gets back and adds my second
address to the mailing list.

The site can be found at http://www.infosite.com/~jkeyzer/handy/index.html

The search database will be updated nightly once new messages start coming in.

Enjoy!
