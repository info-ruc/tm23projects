Another question: _which_ cross-assembler does it use?  The one based on
the ASXXXX cross-assembler (the so-called "Baldwin assembler") or another
one?

There are some bogosities that I know about with the ASXXXX cross-assembler/
linker.  It's still usable, but I had to whack on it a lot to get it
to handle libraries.  I mean no disrespect to the author, but perhaps in
the long run it would be better to do a proper BDF target for it and
use the GNU tools.

Not me, unfortunately.  Oh, does the current cross-compiler still use
the pseudo-register hack?  That was something I always wanted to go back
and fix properly.
