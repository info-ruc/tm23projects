As you probably know, next week's class (March 30) falls smack in the
middle of the TTT meeting, so lots of people will have conflicts. Here is
our suggestion: Let's delay the class until that evening, from 6:30-8:30pm.
We will provide dinner, and we will divide the class time among:

* Guest presentation by Mary Ann Norris of Mattel, who is in charge of the
Mattel/Intel collaboration. (As many of you know, Mattel/Intel introduced
two products at the recent New York Toy Fair -- and received lots of rave
reviews in the press. We will try to pass along some of the press clippings
before next week's class.)

* Debriefing on the Tokyo Toy Fair, where TOT had its own exhibition area
(in collaboration with Tomy) and organized a "Future of Play" symposium.

* Continued discussion of your class projects (please bring ideas,
sketches, prototypes...)

* Discussion of class agenda/schedule for the rest of the semester...

We hope that the change of time is not a major problem for you. Let us know
if it is....
