I posted a message asking IF any one had timing issues using the 6500
and the GP2D02 but never received a response=2E  My concern is running
the sonar, IR and encoder routines concurently as seperate processes=2E
Will IC be able to keep up???  Some reassurance would be appreciated
before I order the Sharp sensors=2E=2E=2E

Has anyone set up a handyboard with an expansion board which uses
both the
Sharp GP2D02 infrared sensors and the Polaroid 6500 sonar device
without
any conflict?  A previous mailing stated a person having a timing conflict
between the two different sensors=2E  If anyone has set it up without
having
such a conflict I would like to know how they did it=2E
