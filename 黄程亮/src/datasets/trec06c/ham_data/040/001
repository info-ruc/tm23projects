I have an expanded Handy Board, and version 5.0 of the ImageCraft C
Compiler.  I am running Windows 98.  Setting up to talk to the Handy
Board is a bit of an obstacle for me.  Has anyone done it with the ICC11
compiler, or is there a site someone knows of that describes how to set
up communications?

Thanks,

Gary Livick
