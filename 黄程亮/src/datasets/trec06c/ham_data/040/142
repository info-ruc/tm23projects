Hi all,

I'd like to write some routines on a PC to communicate through the RS232 port
to a Handyboard.  I'd like to use the Handyboard as the sensor and motor
controller and use the Dauphin DTR-1 PC that I got for the navigation and
logic processor.  It fits great on my Zagros base.  

Can I use the programmer with the MAX 232 chip to do this?  How would I write
the routine on the HB to perform measurements, and occasionally look for a
command from the PC?

Any tips would be appreciated!
Thanks,
Gerald
