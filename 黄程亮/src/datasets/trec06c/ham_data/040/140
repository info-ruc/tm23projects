Nope.  Where's your version?  If it's easier to use libraries with yours,
I'll use that instead.  I want to write a Handyboard library when I get
the toolchain working (but you know that already).

Glad to hear it, 'cuz I'm going towards GCC is for more efficient code,
but with the simplicity of C (as compared to .asm).  The fact that I use
GCC every day in my job probably has something to do with it too.

Now if there were only a Perl for the Handyboard...  (I'm joking).
