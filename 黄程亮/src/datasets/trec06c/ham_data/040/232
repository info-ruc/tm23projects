Hi everybody,

It took me nearly two weeks, but I've solved my "board not responding
problem"!

I had already checked all connections between components, everything ok.

What I hadn't done yet, is to check with my multimeter for possible
shorts on the board.
And: bingo!
Address line A14 (connects 6811, memory chip and 7404) had a short to
ground. All visible traces looked ok, so the short is either beneath a
socket or connector or in the board itself. I've cut the A14 trace on a
couple of places to locate the short: it's between the 65256 memory chip
(pin 1) and the through hole to the 7404. I've isolated the short and
soldered two wires to connect the components again.

Handy is working! No downloading problems anymore, IC3.2 runs smoothly
on my pentium computer.

Hopefully this feedback can be of help to other people running into
similar problems. Everybody who has sent suggestions to solve my
problem: I've very much appreciated your help, thanks again!! No doubt
I'll get back to you for help when I run into new challenges.

Best regards,

Marc Katz
