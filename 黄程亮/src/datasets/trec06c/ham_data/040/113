'Cuz I couldn't get it to compile.  I suppose I could have tried some
other flavors of Linux, or Solaris, but I'd rather start from something
newer, therefore the excitement in finding a new port.

Thanks a bunch!  I think...  Once it is done that means I get to answer
questions, so I suppose maybe I'm not that thrilled anymore...  :-(

Current status:  The complete build tree has been posted to the MSOE web
site, and I managed to snag it yesterday (13.5 MB!).  It is a DJGPP build
tree (DOS GCC compiler), so I'm currently struggling with how to convert
the changes over to a generic gcc-2.8.1 source tree.  So far it configures
ok (as far as I can tell), but won't compile (on Linux or Solaris).  I'm
working on it.

If anyone wants to have GCC for an HC11 on DOS, it's all there for you
already.
