Hi, my name is Becky Browning.  I am currently working on building a =
robot using the Handy Board.  I am having considerable troubles though =
getting either the digital or analog inputs to work.  Right now I have =
analogs ports 0 and 1 working with pre-written programs that I am using =
for ultrasonic sensors and a servomotor.  Is there some kind of =
initialization command that I need to use to get the other ports =
working.  Or is there different software for the expanded version of the =
Handy Board that I may need.  I have tryed using different Handy Board's =
as well as different circuits.  Also, if anybody has just a simple =
circuit that they know works with the inputs that will allow me to vary =
the inputted value so that I can find out if it is a circuit problem or =
a software problem, I would appreciate it.  I am open to any and all =
suggestions anybody might have regarding this problem.

Thanks for your help,

Becky Browning
