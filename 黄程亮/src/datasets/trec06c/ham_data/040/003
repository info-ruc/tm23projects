I'm using win98 an ICC11. I was unable to get ICC11 to communicate with my
handybaord. I instead used hbdl to download the output (s19 file) from ICC11
to my handyboard. This worked without problems.
  My biggest problem was that in my project I forgot to change the starting
stack point from the default 0xfff to 0xfffF (one more f needed).
  If you want it I have a project file and such for ICC11 v5 for libhb.
Cheers,
  Chris Prosser
