It looks like at least three of us were playing with gcc-2.8.1 over the
weekend.  The GCC Miniboard library is now mostly ported over to the
Handyboard, and the ICC11 LCD routines are almost done being ported over. 
I couldn't test out the motor routines because I don't have any driver
chips on my board.  The beeper routine just clicks at the moment, but it
should be easy to fix, considering there's an ICC11 example for how to do
it also.

I hope to have the LCD stuff working tonight or tomorrow night, and then
will post the Handyboard library to my FTP site.
