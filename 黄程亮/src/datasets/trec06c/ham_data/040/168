If you're having problems getting your HB to work on one serial port
  but it works on another, you might want to check for IRQ conflicts.

By default, Com1 and Com3 both are assigned IRQ3, and Com2 & Com4 are
  both assigned IRQ4. So if you have a modem on Com4 using IRQ4, you
  may well have problems if you start trying to use Com2 if it's also
  using IRQ4. I just went through this getting my plug-and-play 
  modem to work under Linux.

If you're using Windows, go to the Control Panel and bring up the
  System window and check your serial devices to see what IRQs 
  they're using. Under linux you can look at /proc/interrupts to see
  what IRQs are being used by what.
