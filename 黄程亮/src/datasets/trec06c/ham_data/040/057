Heck, that sounds pretty easy.  As long as you know where you start from and you use a cartesian or
polar form of V=vsub0 + a*t integrated over time, and you are either working in a vacuum or at such low
velocities that c sub d is negligible, it ought to be a snap.  "a" you can get from one to the cheap
accelerometers we've been talking about!  No wheel slip to deal with either.  Yep, sounds pretty simple
to me.
