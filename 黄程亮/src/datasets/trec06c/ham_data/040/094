Marc, I wonder if the hardware is perfectly ok, but you're inadvertently
attempting to load the wrong software.  I'm not sure where your
lib_hs.lis came from or why IC automatically loads it, but I think it
might be loading the wrong libraries.  I was under the impression that
the r22 files listed above were for the MIT 6.270 controller board or
the Rug Warrior board (I can't remember which).

When I start up IC, it automatically loads the files listed in
lib_hb.lis, of which there are only two:

Synchronizing with board
Pcode version 3.10 present on board
Loading D:\PROGRAMS\IC\libs\lib_hb.lis.
Loading D:\PROGRAMS\IC\libs\lib_hb.c.
Loading D:\PROGRAMS\IC\libs\lib_hb.icb.
Initializing interrupts
Downloading 1142 bytes (addresses 8000-8475): 1142 loaded
Downloading 40 bytes (addresses 8476-849D): 40 loaded
Downloading 16 bytes (addresses 849E-84AD): 16 loaded
Code loaded.

This seems to work fine on my Handy Board; perhaps you could try this on
yours and let us know if that solves the problem.  Best of luck to you!
