Hi,
     First of all, sorry for my english. I have received my HB yesterday
from Patrick Hui, and I have some questions, I have a 12 Volt, 1 Amp, DC
adapter, can i use it?, the manual says that can be problems with 1 to 2
Amps adapters, which kind of problems?. My second question is more trivia=
l,
can I put the HB and the Charger/Serial boards together in the same box?.

                        Thank you in advance.

                                                                Jos=E9 Lu=
