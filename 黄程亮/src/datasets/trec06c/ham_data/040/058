-->Heck, that sounds pretty easy.  As long as you know where you start from and you use a cartesian or
-->polar form of V=vsub0 + a*t integrated over time, and you are either working in a vacuum or at such low
-->velocities that c sub d is negligible, it ought to be a snap.  "a" you can get from one to the cheap
-->accelerometers we've been talking about!  No wheel slip to deal with either.  Yep, sounds pretty simple
-->to me.
I don't know how much of an affect this may have but integrating over
time an accelerometer signal may result in drift.  Slight offsets in the
acceleration signal due to noise can add up over time as the integration
process continues. Therefore, x(t) may be error prone.  Maybe periodic
calibration can help. Just a thought.
