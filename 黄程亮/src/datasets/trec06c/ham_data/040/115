At the above link.  That one appears to be an HC11 emulator with some nice
features.  I haven't played with it much yet.  I think it might be able to
single-step on the target machine also?  Go look at the link above, and
then knock of a directory or two from the URL and go check out the student
senior projects for some more docs on it.  Again, I haven't played with
the other programs there yet, I'm more interested in the C-compiler.
