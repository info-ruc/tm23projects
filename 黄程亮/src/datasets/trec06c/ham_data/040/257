Subject: Using both Sharp GP2D02 and Polaroid 6500

Has anyone set up a handyboard with an expansion board which uses both the
Sharp GP2D02 infrared sensors and the Polaroid 6500 sonar device without
any conflict?  A previous mailing stated a person having a timing conflict
between the two different sensors.  If anyone has set it up without having
such a conflict I would like to know how they did it.
