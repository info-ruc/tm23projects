Some of you have asked for more information on what is expected for your
projects. Here are a few of thoughts...

Your project should be a compelling proof-of-concept. View it as a "first
prototype" -- developed far enough so that you can "play" with it and
demonstrate it to others. We expect that the act of playing with your
prototype will give you (and others) a better appreciation for strengths
and limitations of your concept. 

As you work on your project, you should be doing an ongoing analysis of
your toy concept. Some questions that you should be asking yourselves: 

* how does your toy compare with other existing toys? 

* what are the core features that make your toy engaging? 

* what types of children (age, gender, cognitive style) would find your toy
most interesting?

* are there multiple ways of interacting with the toy? 

* are there ways for children to use the toy in increasingly complex ways
over time? 

* what would children learn from their interactions with the toy? 

* would the toy help children become more creative? more expressive? in
what ways?

* in what ways does the toy leverage new technologies (facilitating play
experiences or learning experiences that would have been impossible without
the technologies)?

* what are the biggest limitations of your toy?

Please note that we are most interested in the ideas underlying your toy --
not the short-term feasibility or manufacturability. Feel free to work on
ideas that are commercially impractical in the short term, but demonstrate
exciting new play possibilities that will become practical in the future.

At the end of the semester, you will be expected (as a group) to do a
presentation on your toy prototype, discussing your design process and
addressing the types of questions and issues listed above. You will also be
expected to create a Web page about your toy (providing the same type of
information as in your presentation).

If you have questions about any of this, please raise your questions in
class, or feel free to talk to any of us.

MTMK...
