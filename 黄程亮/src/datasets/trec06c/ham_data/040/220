The problem with a 12V, 1A *unregulated* power supply is that when you
hook it up to a device that draws significantly less than the rated
current, the power supply will probably deliver significantly more than
12V.  It could be that at half an amp, the power supply delivers more
like 14V or 15V.  This higher voltage could charge your batteries too
quickly and cook them.

Putting the two boards together in the same enclosure ought to work just
fine.

By the way, your English is fine!
