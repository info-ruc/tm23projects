Subject: Guy L. Steele, Jr. in person, today
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.922455295.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

Guy L. Steele, Jr. gave this year's Elliott I. Organick Memorial
Lecture last night.

Today, he will present another lecture

	Speculative Parallelism Speeds Up Floating Point Arithmetic
	3:30pm Friday, March 26, 1999 
	104 Engineering and Mines Classrom Building.

	http://www.cs.utah.edu/outreach/eio.html
	http://www.cs.utah.edu/~gary/SpecPar.html

Besides the lecture, there are two informal meetings:

	Growing a Language (think, Java)
	10:45am
	EMCB 122

	Roundtable discussion
	1:30pm
	MEB 3151 (Computer Science Large Conference Room)

Guy is a very productive and influential young computer scientist,
with major contributions to several programming languages (Lisp,
Common Lisp, Scheme, C, C*, Java, ....), architectures (Lisp Machine,
Thinking Machines' Connection Machine, UltraSPARC, ...), and more.  If
you can find time to attend any of these, I think you'll find them
rewarding.
