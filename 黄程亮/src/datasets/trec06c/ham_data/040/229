Subject: Patch released for HC11 and GCC 2.8.1 
In-Reply-To: <199904021853.KAA07613@mail.Legato.COM>
Message-Id: <Pine.LNX.4.04.9904022252180.28419-100000@gatekeeper.we7u.net>
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII


To set up a 68HC11 compiler on Unix-variants using gcc-2.8.1,
please go to ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/u/a/archer and snag these
files:

	gcc281-hc11-readme
	hc11-patch-latest.tar.gz

The readme is also contained inside the .tar.gz file,
so you only really need the 2nd file.

Let me know how it works, if it works, and if it doesn't
work, why.  Please also let me know if the readme file
could use clarification.  I put my changes (few as they
were) under GPL.

Thanks,

Curt, WE7U.
