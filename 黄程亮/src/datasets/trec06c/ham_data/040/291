The idea behind a reactive (behavior based) architecture of a Rug
Warrior robot is essentially stateless=2E  You may want to add some kind of
schedule or activation layer (process ) that enables the low level
behaviors based on some type of state or map information=2E  A book from
MIT Press call BEHAVIOR BASED ROBOTICS is an excellent source book
on behavior and hybrid robot architectures=2E

Hello,

I would like to know if there is anyone who has a good idea to avoid
obstacles in a intelligent way=2E
I've build a Rugwarrior robot=2E
My robot has two IR proximity detectors (in front) and four bump
switches (one on each side)=2E If you simple build in a reflex which will act
every time the same, e=2Eg=2E bump front will cause the robot to move
backward and go left, it will be not enough=2E At one moment the robot
needs to know was happend some time before=2E You need some history
of all the sensors, to avoid getting in a loop when the robot is in a corner
of a room/field=2E
Any ideas I like to know to solve this problem=2E

Greetings Emiel
