Hello, I just began construction on my Interface/charger board and all
of the preliminary test voltages check out as expected except for the
voltage at pin 3 of J9 when pin 6 is jumpered to pin 10 of the MAX232
chip.  Do you have any suggestions?  What problems is this going to
cause and how can I resolve them?  When I measure the voltage at pin 3
of J9 with no jumper present, the voltage checks out at -9 volts, when I
jump the two pins on the chip, the voltage is around -1 instead of +10.
Thank you for your help

    Eric
