Hello,

I would like to know if there is anyone who has a good idea to avoid =
obstacles in a intelligent way.
I've build a Rugwarrior robot.
My robot has two IR proximity detectors (in front) and four bump =
switches (one on each side). If you simple build in a reflex which will =
act every time the same, e.g. bump front will cause the robot to move =
backward and go left, it will be not enough. At one moment the robot =
needs to know was happend some time before. You need some history of all =
the sensors, to avoid getting in a loop when the robot is in a corner of =
a room/field.
Any ideas I like to know to solve this problem.

Greetings Emiel
