Subject: HB Encoders capabilities?

Can the HB measure encoder pulses faster than 1 MHz?

Assume we have an encoder that does 500 pulses per revolution.
What happens when we exceed 2 revolutions per second?
What happens if the encoder has two channels (quadrature) and we exceed 1 
revolution per second?
