I have a Rug Warrior fitted with the Polaroid 6500 sonar, and a Handy Board
that uses the GP2D02 sensor.  Both applications use a servo for aiming.  On
the Handy Board site, the libraries have been altered to support the GP2D02,
but I did my own driver for it, so I cannot say how well that driver works
with the Handy Board sonar drivers.  I also use the Rug Warrior version of
sonar driver.

So, somebody else will have to discuss using the Handy Board drivers, but I
can say that the drivers I use should work fine together.  There is complete
control of when they are fired, as neither of my routines utilize the 1000
system interrupt.

I like the idea of using these two sensors together, as the GP2D02 fills in a
sensing hole.  Getting through doorways and down halls has been difficult
without either detuning the standard infrared detection system, or ignoring
it altogether.  Plus, the GP2D02 works well at short range.  I currently use
it on a robot to pick up coke cans.  See

Good luck,
