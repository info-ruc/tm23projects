I purchased two Sharp GP2D02 infrared sensors from Acroname and downloaded
their interface to a Handy Board and Barry Brouilette's interface to the
Handy Board.  I was wondering which any of you have used and why so I can
select one to use on in my project.  I am using the expansion board and am
also wondering which ports you are plugging the GP2D02's into?

Thanks
