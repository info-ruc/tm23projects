Are there any tools for programming the E9/E1 config registers from Linux
or NT?  I don't have a DOS or Win95 machine handy at the moment, and I
remember that the download program for the hc11E processors must be a
little different.  I can't get DLM to run in the emulated DOS window on
NT, which is no surprise.

I think I'm going to put in a long wait in the startup for GCC, just so I
don't waste the config register again during debug...
