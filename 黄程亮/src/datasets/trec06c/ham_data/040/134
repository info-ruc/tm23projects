Ken's comments made me look at it again:  Gcc-2.6.3+HC11 now compiles fine
for me on Solaris 2.5, but I know I had trouble compiling it on Red Hat
Linux 5.2. I would go back and check that configuration one more time but
for the fact that I now have gcc-2.8.1+HC11 compiling (as of this
morning). On Solaris anyway.  Linux is next. 

I had to make mods to config/m6811/local.h to fold-const.c to get it to
compile.  I'm not sure I did it right so I'm checking with the last guy to
port it to GCC to make sure.  Once I've checked it out I'll post a patch
to gcc-2.8.1.

I haven't played yet with the cross-assembler or the linker, just the
compiler itself.  It generates HC11 assembly code.

Anybody else here familiar enough with GCC sources to do a quick review of
the VERY minor changes?
