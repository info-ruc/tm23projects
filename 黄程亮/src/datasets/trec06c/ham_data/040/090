Subject: Polaroid Sonar Device fried!!!!

The C3279 chip ("Q1") on my sonar device fried.  I checked the expansion
board and it is assembled correctly.  I am not sure why it would fry.  I
added the 0.1uF electrolytic capacitor to C7 position as stated in the
sonar.html site and suggeted by an email.  Does anyone have any idea why
this would happen?

Thanks,

Scott
