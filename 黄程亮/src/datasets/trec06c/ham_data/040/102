How come you didn't simply use the 2.6.3 cross-compiler?  I doubt the
optimizer is improved _that_ much for the HC11.

It was a while ago, and I don't remember how much of Carlos's work
is left.  It all had to be converted to the new assembler syntax
anyway.  I think I used his code as a guide when implementing the
core functionality.  But anyway, yes, you have my permission to
adapt those libraries to the Handyboard.

I think the address I had for the people at Coactive Aesthics who
did the GCC port started bouncing a while ago, so perhaps they
moved on.

Not me, but it would be a good thing.
