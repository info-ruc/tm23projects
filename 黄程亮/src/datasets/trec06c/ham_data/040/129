I currently use the HB with the Polaroid 6500=2E  I'm considering the
expansion board and Barry Brouillette's GP2D02 routines for IR ranging=2E=20=


these routines interfere with the timing of the sonar=2Ec routines or for
that matter any other time critical sensors (encoders?)  Also, how many
Sharp detectors are supported in the interrupt routine, two or three??
Thanks,=20=
