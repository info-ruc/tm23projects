Will & Keith,

The following information is in a file called readme.ic that should be
in your IC directory.

By Default IC will use COM1. If you need IC to use a different serial
port, you can run it with argument like so:

ic -port com2

or you can run ic with the -config option to reconfigure IC.

Good luck
Jim

>DOING!  Yeah, now that you mention it, I had the same problem when I got my
HB.  Took me about a week before I got around to trying COM1.  That fixed
it, so I left it that way and forgot about it long ago.  At the time, no one
on the list had any helpful suggestions for me, either.
