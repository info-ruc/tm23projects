Subject: Sharp IS1U60 availablity

I'm looking to purchase about 12-15 IS1U60s to use as optical bump sensors
and I'm having trouble finding someone that has them in stock and doesn't
want $5.50 for them.

Sterling Electronics, 781-938-6200, sells the part for around $1.75, with
a $25 min order, but they don't have any in stock and don't expect to get
parts until sometime in Feb.

A few other companies had them in stock but they had a minimum quantity of
100 units.

Any ideas who I can try?
