hi ,
Attached from the previous mail, I have already solved the problem listed
below. It is the 7404 is damaged .What causes it? Any ideas?

RIght now this problem that melted my socket on the L293, the supply I used
is 12V supply to my 2 DC motors. I'm using Grandcell rechargable alkaline
batteries. Each is 1.5v.
The measure current is about 700mA.

rgds,
phillip
