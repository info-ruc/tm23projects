Subject: [9fans] removing a name from the name space

using BIND, a process can 
customize a namespace so that /big/long/file/name
can be referred to as /biggie.

is there a way to *remove* /big/long/file/name
from the namespace as seen from a particular process?

why would one want to do that?  well, suppose that I
want to run a game that does not need the network.
before I run the game, I remove the file that "exports"
(terminology?) the network interface from the game's
namespace so that it impossible for the game to act as a
trojan horse.  so, it is useful for security reasons.
