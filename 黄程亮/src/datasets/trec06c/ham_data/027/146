Subject: Re: 32V DC Motor

While on the subject of motors and H-bridges.  I recently ordered a L298
based motor controller kit from JCM Electronics.

Unlike the L293, the L298 supports breaking and has two bits for
direction and one enable bit.  It would be easy to add use an inverter to
generate the extra direction bit, but breaking sounds like it could be a
useful feature, so I would like to be able to support it.
 
The the standard PWM code should work just fine for strobing the enable,
all I would have to do is find two extra output pins and hack on the way
the PWM code sets the direction.
 
I only need two motors, so I was thinking about removing both L293s and
stealing the direction bits from channel 2 and 3.  I need the SPI so those
pins are not available.  What would you guys recommend?
 
Is breaking really worth it, or should I just get an inverter?
