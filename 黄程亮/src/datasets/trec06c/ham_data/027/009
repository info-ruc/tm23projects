Hi all,

Ok now i know how to charge my NiCad batteries i have laying around.

Thanks to Brett and Scott for the info.

I have been doing my sums to try and work out the series resistor i need to
charge a 2Amp NiCad at C/10, but my figures dont seem right.

Iam using an old laptop power adapter rated at 15V @ 4.4A, ok so here goes.

                                                     2A
charge current needed for nicad =   -------  = 200mA.
                                                     10

                                                   15volts
Resistor needed =                         ----------  = 75 Ohms
                                                     0.2A

power rating of resistor =                15Volts * 200mA  = 3Watts


Series resistor needed =                 75 Ohms @ 3 Watts.
                                                     -----------------------
-------
The 75 Ohms bit seems reasonable to me but 3Watts must be way to much.
could anyone show me where i have gone wrong.

Thanks Russ.
