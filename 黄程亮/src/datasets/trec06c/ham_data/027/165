The platform in question was based on the 'Hercules' r/c car that is
available at some of the FAO Schwarz stores.  This platform appears to be
identical to what was used by the USC entry in the 1997 Robo Cup
competition.  Clem (ctaylor@SRTC.COM) has purchased one of the kits, and was
interfacing to the internal H-bridge.  I have not heard anything further of
the progress.  There are a few pictures of USC's entry on the following
pages:

Hope this helps!

A couple of weeks ago, someone wrote and said that Todd Graham had told
them where to get a "cool, low cost" robot platform.  I was wondering what,
where, and how much was that platform?  Information would be appreciated.
thanks
