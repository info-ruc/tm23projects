hi,
I came to know that the power expansion can be used on J13 ( 1x4 pin jack).
However, 
why there is a 2 positive holes and 2 negatives on this header? If i'm
using a pair of DC motor 12V each, and i supply a 12v alkaline or NIMH
rechargable batteries, can i just insert only a positive and a negative
wire to the holes only instead 4 holes on the pin jack ? What is the
significant of having 2 positive holes and 2 negative ?

rgds,
phillip
