A gell cell battery is charged via a maximum allowed charging voltage.  If
the charger doesn't limit the charging voltage to less than 14 volts it
will shorten the life of a 12v gell cell considerably.

A Ni-Cad uses a constant charging current, but the voltage can easily get
up to 18v.  I'm sure you can find more technical information on the
subject, but I suggest not exceeding a 14v limit for 12v gell cells.

Most any battery wholesaler would be able to provide you with specific
information.  You can find them in the yellow pages under 'batteries,
commercial, wholesale'.
