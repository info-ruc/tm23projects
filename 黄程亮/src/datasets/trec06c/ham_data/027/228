hi,
I have a big problem. I followed the method of yours that just lift up pin
8 of one L293 
and wirewrapped it. The positive supply is wirewrapped to pin 8 . How about
the negative supply of the batteries should insert or wirewrapped? I
inserted the negative supply in the bottom row of digital input as ground
together. 
Suddenly. after a short while, the L293 turn so hot. It burnt my hand.
Besides, the socket on the HD mounted with pin 4,5,12,13 of L293 has melted
in that particular area. Simply it is a plastic part. What is really
happens ?

Should I also wirewrapped the negative supply to one of the grounding point
pin of L293 ? By the way, If I cut the trace on HD, is it only cut the
trace to the positive supply only . How about the negative supply trace ?
should I cut? BEsides, If I cut, it there any way to mend it back to
originally ?

MOST IMPORTANTLY, Where should I cut ? Please show me the path? My proect 
jam down here. I really in a rush to complete and submit the project .
thank you very much . Please reply asap.

rgds,
phillip
