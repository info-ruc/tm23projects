  Check B. G. Micro 800-276-2206 www.bgmicro.com  I would not be too concerned
with the actual part number, just look for an Infared sensor or remote control
sensor.  Also get the pin outs as these may be different.
    Also have you considered using fewer sensors and selecting which LED is
flashing to determin where the wall is located.  This might be cheaper.

Hope this helps
