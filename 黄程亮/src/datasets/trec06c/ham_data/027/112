Subject: Which M68HC11 to use
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am planning to build a HandyBoard, and am in the "Gathering Stage". I
just recieved the docs from Motorola; the "HC11 Reference Manual", and
the "MC68HC11A8 Programming Reference Guide". The Parts list for the
HandyBoard calls out for the MC68HC11A1FN.

The Reference Manual (in section 2.2.1) says the -A8 is the same as the
-A0 and -A1 except that the disabling of the internal ROM and/or EEPROM
is determined in the non-volatile config register.

Please let me know if I interpreted this correcly. I have NOOO HC11
experience!


Questions:

1. Will the -A8 as opposed to the -A1 work with the HandyBoard?
2. Has anyone adapted the HB for use with the HC11F1 or HC11K4?
3. Is the "FN" (in ref to the part listing) just a vendor code?
