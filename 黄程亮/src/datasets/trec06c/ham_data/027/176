Hi all,

I have a miniboard I built recently that won't go into download mode.
In the note called "mb-debug.txt" on ftp://Cherupakha.media.mit from
Chuck McManis he describes the exact problem I have.

"If the RED LED light ups, or the motor LEDS flicker, then you are
probably not in download mode.  This can be caused by a defective
run/download switch or an open connection on the 5V pin of the switch."

The switch checks out O.K. and I have 5 V on the first pin.  The third
pin is ground as it should be and the center pin connect to MOBD on the
6811 chip.

Does anyone have other suggestions??  (sorry this is not handyboard)
