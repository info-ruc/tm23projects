Dear electronic cyber-club house buddies:

Please don't follow up on this petition.  More significant than it being
off topic, it is also unlikely to be effective.  Phil Agre explains the
reasons better than I could:

    "DO NOT use a chain-letter petition. A chain-letter petition
     is an action alert that includes a list of names at the
     end, inviting people to add their own name, send in the
     petition if their name is the 30th or 60th or etc, and in any
     case forward the resulting alert-plus-signature-list to
     everyone they know. This idea sounds great on the surface,
     but it really doesn't work. The problem is that most of the
     signatures will never reach their destination, since the
     chain will fizzle out before reaching the next multiple of
     30 (or whatever) in length. What's even worse, a small
     proportion of the signatures will be received in the
     legislator's office many times, thus annoying the staff and
     persuading them that they're dealing with an incompetent
     movement that can never hold them accountable."

Anyone interested in information on how to engage in effective Internet
based political activism is refered to the very readable "Designing
Effective Action Alerts for the Internet":
