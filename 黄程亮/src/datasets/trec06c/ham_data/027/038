hi,
I need to know what is really the 'processing time' that used in encoder
especially used when a pulse is actually being recorded. 

I load the file "encoder.lis" into the standard lib file. I'm using a
optical encoder which is a slotted wheel. When the first pulse is detected,
the first number appear on the LCD
is 5 or 8. Why not 1 only since is only the first pulse detected ?

rgds,
phillip
