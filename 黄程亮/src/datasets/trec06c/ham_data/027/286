Okay, this may seem silly, but I've got a very basic question.  

Just received a new handyboard (assembled, ready to go from Gleason).  After
charging it up, installing the pcode and booting all works fine.  The
'Interactive C' text shows on the screen.  I can run IC and use the beep()
functions and such.  Most other functions seem to work as well.  But, I
cannot get it to do a printf command.  If I try, it sits at the 'Downloading
X number of bytes,  X loaded' prompt and never returns.  It does seem to
download the code segment, just gets stuck doing it.  What am I doing wrong?
The hardware appears fine, as the display does show the IC welcome screen.
Is there some other special library you have to use?  At the startup of IC,
I show the following libs being loaded:

ic/libs/lib_hb.lis
lib_hb.c
ic/libs/r22_ir.lis
ic/libs/r22_ir.icb
ic/libs/r22_ir.c
