Please be careful on how you read the numbers from hbench-OS.  At least
the networking numbers are probably not measuring what you think.  The
benchmarks are flawed in several aspects and actually measure different
things on different OS's.  I have not examined their benchmarks of map
and unmap, however, if they are as simplistic as the networking benchmarks
they they are probably measuring something that is related, but not quite
what you expect.

PS:  A good benchmark is often hard to write
