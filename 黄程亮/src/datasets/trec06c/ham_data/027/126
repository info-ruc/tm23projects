Edmund,
I recently received 2 LMD18200 chips from National Semiconductor through their
free samples order (limit 2/day, 5/week). These chips deliver up to 3A
continous output, and up to 6A peak. They are ideal for driving DC/ Stepper
motors.
All the schematics for connecting these can be found in the FAQ section of the
Handyboard webpage. The motor routines included with IC are supposed to be
compatible with these chips.
Good Luck
Dave
