the limit isn't really a function of the compiler,
since pcc uses the same one,
but APE's libraries are typically larger.
the problem is possibly a kernel limit on
the PC: check that you don't need
to change SEGMAPSIZE in /sys/src/9/pc/mem.h

#define	SEGMAPSIZE	64	/* 16 is for wooses */

i think this is in the FAQ somewhere, which you might
check for details (in case anything else is required).

perhaps /sys/src/ape/lib/ap/plan9/malloc.c needs
similar changes to /sys/src/libc/port/malloc.c
(which are in a boddle somewhere).
