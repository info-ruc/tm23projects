     I would be very surprised that you overcharged the batteries to the point
of no function.  Your batteries would have to have gotten very hot for that
time (batteries deteriorate in a charger due to evaporation of electrolite
water).  Generaly over charging weakens a cell (one battery in a pack) and
gives it a funny discharge characteristic.  No life at all means a broken wire
or trace.  Take the batteries out, start at the battery pack with an ohm meter
and check the circuit from the battery minus terminal to Ground; and the plus
terminal to: the 5V regulator, the supply for the memory chip, and the motor
supply.  When you find the bad spot, solder a wire bridge around the break,
and try to figure out why it blew before putting the batteries back.
