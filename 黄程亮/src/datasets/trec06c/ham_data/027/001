We experienced a curious problem on mail alias of
upas.

In a user's /mail/box/user/names file, we have a
line as
ryu	ryu-98@abcd.cias.osakafu-u.ac.jp,

and then, tryed to send a mail to "ryu" from acme
Mail program.

As a result, we got an error message from the upas
system as:

Mail to "ryu" alias 'local!ryu' from 'Liz.Bimmler' failed.
The error message was:
unknown user.

Of course, we have not a local user of "ryu" or
"Liz Bimmler" anywhere.
