Hi,=20

	I'm using the Polaroid 6500 ranging board with the sonar routines on =
the HB web site.  When I call the sonar on one HB it returns -1 but when =
I try it on another HB it works fine.   So it isn't the sensor. Could =
anyone tell me which conections on my HB would cause this result.  Would =
it be the SPI header(??).  I'm not too verse in electronics so any help =
would be greatly appreciated.

Thank You,
Peter
