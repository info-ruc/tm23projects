Just a quick note..

As i remember if you stack the SN??? chips to get the current rating you
also have to
piggyback a L293D as these incorporate the anti-spike protection diodes as
the others don't

There's an alternative to th4e L293D chip that fits the Handy Board.
This chip can supply 1A.  I know you need 2+ Amps but a common method
adopted by some people is piggybacking two or more chips.  (You put one
on top of another to allow the curent  to be divided between the separate
chips.  Thus if you piggyback three, you should theoretically be able to
supply 3A which is what you need.

I believe this chips is  the SN??? that you can look up in the Handyboard
FAQ somewhere.
