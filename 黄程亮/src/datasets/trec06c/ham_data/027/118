  hi 

  i'm trying to use the handy-board to drive a 32V DC motor. a webpage at 
  the handyboard website showed that this can be done by cutting the 
  original power trace and simply plugging in a new external power 
  source(a 36V battery pack?).  

  what i would like to know is whether the handy-board can supply a 2.3A      
  current to the motor with the increase in supply voltage. however, it 
  seems that the existing L293D motor driver can only supply 600mA. does
  this mean i have to use a different chip with higher ouput current
  capability or even a separate motor driver board? if possible, could 
  someone please recommend a suitable motor driver chip other than the
  L293D? Thank you.
