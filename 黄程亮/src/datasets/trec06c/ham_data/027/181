That test from hBench-OS is measuring the speed of the 
memory-mapped file calls, which don't exist in Plan 9.

The necessary hooks are there and are being used to
load executable images -- a long time ago I
thought about proposing an extension to segattach
to accept "file!n" where n is an open file descriptor
as at least a read-only mmap.

I'ld be interested to hear what numbers you got
out of hBench under Plan 9 on a particular machine as compared
with that same exact machine running say Linux or one of
the BSDs.
