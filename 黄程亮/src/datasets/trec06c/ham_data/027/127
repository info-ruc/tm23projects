Hi all,

    My name is Marcelo Manjon, and i've just finished my 1st. version of
my Micromouse Robot. However, since it had some aligment problems, i've
decided to use more 12 IR sensors, in order to help the robot to stay
aligned along the maze and, consequently, my aligment software code
routine has increased (all my code has about 4500 bytes). Since i'm
using Interactive C Version 2.8, every time i try to download the
software to my Handy Board , it says it does not have enough memory in
order to download all my software code to the Handy Board. I would like
to know if there is any way of increase the available memory for my
software( i don't use routines like printf and others ones, but it seems
they are all encapsulated in pcode.s19 file and i don't know how to take
them off this file). Is there any advantage concerning memory space in
Interactive C 3.1 ?

    If anyone has any suggestions, please help me..

Thank you very much.

Marcelo Manjon
