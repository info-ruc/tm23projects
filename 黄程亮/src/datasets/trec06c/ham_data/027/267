hi Fred,
Why there is 2 holes each for the positive and negative supply on the pin
jack (J13)?
I thought that just insert one hole each for the positive and negative
supply only. I need to know why the J13 is designed for 1x4 holes before i
decide to cut the trace.
Is there any special requirement for power expansion for motor that i need
to use 4 holes instead of 2 holes ?
If I use 2 holes only( positive and negative) what will happen ?
I supply 12v rechargable alkaline batteries to 2 DC motor.
There is no explanation in the archive why the J13 is design with 4holes (
2 for positive & 2 for negative).pls help.
Thank. I need to hear from you asap. 
rgds,
phillip
