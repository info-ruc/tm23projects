Just a quick anecdote about Gel-Cells.

     I have a small and useless robot that simply rolls around on the floor
and bumps off things.  The motors are powered by a small Gel-Cell.  I had run
it that day and run the motor batteries flat, so I rigged a simple charger (a
transformer and bridge rectifier), hooked it up and a couple of hours later
left the house.  A few more hours I came home and found a strange smell in the
air.  After about 15 minutes investigating, I recognized the smell as sulfer.
I found the battery hot and bubbling.  I said to myself that I'm going to have
to get another battery, this one is toast.  Well that was four months ago, I
flipped on the robot yesterday and the motors came up to full speed.  The
battery has kept its charge for all this time.  I do not know what the drain
life of the battery is, but I didn't know what it was before I cooked it
either.
     I just wanted to say I'm surprised at how robust these little guys are.
