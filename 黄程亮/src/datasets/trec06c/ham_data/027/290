I've asked for help with the floating point bugs in IC before, and nobody
seems to care.  Unfortunately, I've come to not use IC floating point
variables at all, since I can't trust them.  It's all very frustrating since
none of the IC versions support long int division either; which also
seriously cripples the use of IC for precision fixed point calculations.

Later,
