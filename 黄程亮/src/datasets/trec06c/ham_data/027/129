There's an alternative to th4e L293D chip that fits the Handy Board.
This chip can supply 1A.  I know you need 2+ Amps but a common method 
adopted by some people is piggybacking two or more chips.  (You put one 
on top of another to allow the curent  to be divided between the separate 
chips.  Thus if you piggyback three, you should theoretically be able to 
supply 3A which is what you need.

I believe this chips is  the SN??? that you can look up in the Handyboard 
FAQ somewhere.
