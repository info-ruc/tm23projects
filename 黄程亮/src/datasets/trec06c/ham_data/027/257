Call 1-800-453-4652 for a Lego Shop-At-Home catalog.  They have an
assortment called #5229 Gears & Differentials for $4.50, that has all
but the huge 40-tooth gears.  Shipping is free.

If you need the 40-tooth gears, you can get four of them along with
twelve of the 24-tooth gears from Pitsco Dacta (1-800-534-6784).  Ask
for part number 779966, Large Gear Wheels ($6.75 + s&h).

Lego Shop-At-Home *might* also have the large gear wheels, but they're
not in the catalog.  Still, I've been able to get stuff that's not
listed by asking for a specific part number.  See if they have #9966
(the last four digits of the Pitsco number).  Good luck!
