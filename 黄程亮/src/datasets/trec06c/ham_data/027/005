The only way to boot from a disk is to have a boot loader that supports
plan9 kernels. Such a loader is installed if one use SunOS4 or OpenBSD
(and apperantly old versions of Solaris? I tried 2.5, but it did not work
for me)

What one can do on a Solaris system is to get hold of the following SunOS4
programs/data files:

/boot
/usr/kvm/mdec/installboot
/usr/kvm/mdec/bootsd

and do the following on a minimal 'a' partition (I had the /dev
compatibility package installed on Solaris) on _another_ disk, not the
Solaris boot disk:

mount /dev/dsk/c0t1d0s0 /mnt
cp /boot /mnt/boot
/usr/kvm/mdec/installboot /mnt/boot /usr/kvm/mdec/bootsd /dev/rsd1a
cp plan9kernel /mnt
