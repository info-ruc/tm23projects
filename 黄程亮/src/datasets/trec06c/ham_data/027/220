Dr. Gilfoyle,

I will be faxing a revised quote shortly.  Some preliminary answers to
your questions:

Unfortunately, we have not b'marked the 2x450's.  i do have some numbers
for a dual 400 though:

specint_rate  214
specfp_rate    98.4

> 
> 2. How many FLOPS is each machine?

Preliminary numbers from a customer who has set up a similar config have
been ~30 MegaFLOPS.  These tests have not been run internally.

Yes

We have extended warranties available.  Depending on the hardware
configuration, we can offer a rate for 2 extra years in addition to the
one you get with the system purchase.  I'll also include this in the
revised quote.

Best Regards,

Tim
