Hi everyone,

The mistake you make in your calculation is that in your calculation you take
the entire 15V for the resistor and this leaves no voltage for charging your
NiCad.
Do the same thing again and deduct your NiCad voltage from the 15V you have
available for your charger and make sure that the voltage to charge your Nicad
is larger then the Nicad voltage.
You will end up with a smaller series resistor and also have a lower power
dump in that resistor.

Let me know what results you get.
