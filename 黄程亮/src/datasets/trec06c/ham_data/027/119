hi,
i really need help urgently. Currently, I running my robot using 2 DC motor
on port 2 & 3. I used external power supply to the L293D (pin 8). I did not
cut the trace. I used Alkaline battery 12V recharagable . when I run my
robot, it is running smoothly. However,  something went wrong. The port 3
for the left motor is not rotate anymore. 
I tried numerous debugging method to see what is the problem.

Firstly, the outcome of the problem is that the port 3 red LED (reverse) is
always turning on. When I used the command :

a) motor (3,50); ==>   red LED and green LED is light up
b )motor (3, -50); ==> red LED is light up. Green LED is not light up
the red LED is still turning on for both command . Not the green LED.
However, When I used command :  off(3) ;   the red LED on port 3 turned
off.

I tried to load the "hbtest.c"  and then type " testmotors( ); "  The
result is that the motor LEDS is begin to flash one at a time , beginning
with motor 0-green, motor 0-red, motor 1-green, etc. When it reach port3
green LED, the port 3 red LED turn on all the way without turning  off. The
red LED stay light up even though the rest of the LED is still flashing
orderly. The port 3 green LED is still can flash normally. NO damage. Only
the port 3 red LED has problem.

Moreover,  i pluck in the DC motor wires into the port 3, the motor is not
moving. The rest of the port is moving . 
 
Please help .Thank .

rgds,
phillip
