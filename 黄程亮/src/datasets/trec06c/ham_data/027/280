Hello,
I have finished building Matt Harlan's H-Bridge circuit (from the Handyboard
FAQ) and I have come across the following instructions:

 "Make sure the supply ground for the 18200's is connected to the HB ground.
You'll get some very strange results if you don't.  Use the motor supply
header on the HB for this connection.  You can take advantage of the noise
filtering of the HB that way."
"The motor control routines in IC are completely compatible with the 18200's.
The enable lines for the HB motor chips go to the PWM line on the 18200's.
The direction lines from the HB go to the direction line on the 18200's.  
HB pin 1 to PWM motor 1
HB pin 2 to direction motor 1
HB pin 9 to PWM motor 2
HB pin 10 to direction motor 2"

First, does this mean that I should connect the HB ground to the 30VDC ground
I'm using to power the motors?
Second, the does the pinout given above refer to the motor ports on the
handyboard? If so, there is no connection on pin 2, and pins 9 and 10 refer to
two different motors!?
Thanks in advance for any advice.
Dave
