I think I overcharged my handyboard, I chargedf it for two days. I 
charged my handyboard using the Normal charge method. My handyboard is 
not responding at all. There is no power bulb glowing. Do you have any 
solution. I had to complete my project.
Kindly reply me as soon as possible.

Thank u
Madhu
