Hi all,
    I found an interesting article by Don Lancaster in May 1998 issue of the
magazine,
Electronics Now.  Maxim makes a chip (MAX125) that will convert accurately
four 
channels of analog data to 13 bits accuracy, plus talk about a device for $79
that
stick to the glass of an ordinary power meter and then counts the black marks.
It
comes complete with software for the PC or MAC. 
    For bundle of home-energy management resources go to Don Lancasters web
page : www.tinaja.com and download MUSE112.PDF

Good luck ,

Terry Howsham
