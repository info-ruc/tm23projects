I'm thinking about ordering the Plan 9 distribution to get something
fresh
to play around with. Not to make things too easy for me I'm (and to make
use of machines present in the appartment) thinking of using an old
SPARCstation IPC as my file server and a pentium/200 as CPU server. What
I
basically want to know is: is this a resonable configuration ? Will the
IPC
be fas enough to give resonable performance ? Better ideas ?
