Dr. Gilfoyle,

It occurred to me that your request for three monitors is not really
necessary.  The set up as I have quoted basically allows you to control
all 9 nodes and 1 master from one station.  The KVM switch has 8 ports
so two units connected to each other are necessary to link 10 systems.

Of course we'll set it up how you like but it seems a waste of money to
have three monitors set up for 10 systems when one would suffice.

Please let me know what you think.

Tim
