You could use resistors to make a 1/10 voltage divider.

If you need high input impeadance,  you could build an Op-Amp circuit to
divide the voltage by 10.

Most ADC chips have a pin that is the reference voltage for the high end
of the scale--set this pin to 50V.  I think there is a pin on the 68CH11
that is a referece voltage for the ADCs, although I'm not sure it can go
to 50V.
