	This is just an idea skeleton, but not too hard to flesh out, if
you've worked with TTL.  The Handy Board memory map maps some upper 32K
addresses to I/O "ports".  Look at the schematic and you can see which
addresses generate which enable lines.  Some are used already, but some
are free.  Put an 8-bit latch on one of the output ports.  Have your
software map whatever your actual speed values are from 0-7.  Use this
0-7 value to set the highest bit and every one below it in the latch.
Attach LEDs to the latch outputs.  If you do it right, you should get the
rising/falling bargraph effect you're looking for.

	Numeric example:  say your hardware returns a 16-bit unsigned
integer (range 0-65535).  Divide 65536 into 8 equal parts so you know
where the threshold changes are:  0, 8192, 16384, 24567, 32768, 40960,
49152, and 57344.  Read your speed value and use these thresholds to map
it to 0-7.  Say the value was 22438; that maps to level 2.  So, set bits
2, 1, and 0 at the memory address corresponding to your output latch.
The corresponding 3 LEDs should light.  If the speed went up to 39345,
that's level 4, so set bits 4-0 in the output latch; if the speed fell to
4154, that's level 0, so set bit 0 in the output latch.

	The actual hardware to do this can be easily reverse-engineered
from the Handy Board schematic, as Fred does exactly the same thing for
motor outputs; just drive LEDs instead of motors.
