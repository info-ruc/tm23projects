You might want to consider a hardware solution: there are a variety
of switcher boxes available for connecting a VGA monitor, mouse and
keyboard to multiple computers, such that you can switch between them.

The cheaper ones contain no active electronics; I've used one of these,
and it degraded the video signal somewhat, causing annoying artifacts
on the screen.  I've since switched to the Raritan SwitchMan, and I'm
quite happy with it.  Cost may be a concern, but remember, it's cheaper
than getting more monitors (and less space-consuming).
