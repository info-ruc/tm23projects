I'm using an E9 part in a couple of Handyboards.  When you set up
the CONFIG register (I think most of the downloaders do this for you),
you end up disabling the internal ROM and then it looks like an A1
part or so.  Works great for me.  I think the part number I'm using
is similar to the first one you mention.
