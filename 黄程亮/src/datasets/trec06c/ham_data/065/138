i'm assembling the handyboard according to the instructions found on the
HB site.  When measuring the E clock signal using a voltmeter, i register
5V instead to the anticipated 2.5V.  i've re-checked all the solder joints
but there doesn't appear to be any problems.  and also, the green power
LED continuously stays lighted even when trying to put the HB into
download mode. 
any suggestions? 
thanks for any help provided.
