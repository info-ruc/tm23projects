   A bit of searching for the meaning of this keyword turns up the following:


\nowidctlpar
                        No widow/orphan control. This is a paragraph-level 
property and is used to override the document-level
                        \widowctrl.
  \widctlpar
                        Widow/orphan control is used for the current 
paragraph. This is a paragraph property used to override the
                        absence of the document-level \widowctrl
\widowctrl
                          Enable widow and orphan control.


   So just what the hell is widow control?


Widows and Orphans
      If Widow Control is checked, Word will try to ensure that single 
lines of paragraphs do not appear at the top or bottom of a page
      while the rest of the paragraph is on another page.


   You might want to check if there's some check box related to this and 
change it's state.  Next version of DMDX will skip these control tags, 
however unless you can't get around the problem I'll not be releasing a 
special fix just for that.
