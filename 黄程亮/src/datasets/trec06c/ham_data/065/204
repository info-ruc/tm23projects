has anyone had any success hooking up brushless motors to a handyboard?
basically, the problem i'm having is there is only one gnd pin on the
motor, which is both for the internal digital logic and to sink the
current through the motor.  it's a micromo 1525 if anyone would care to
take a look and see if they could help me out, i'd appreciate it.

a few more details if it might help... 

pins on the motor:
break, direction, frequency (output), vdd (motor +) gnd, and vcc.

i've got all the control signals hooked up no problem, vcc and gnd are on
the SPI port.  vdd is on the + end of motor1 port.  i tried just running
it like that, but the handyboard doesn't seem to like it (i get both the
red and the green motor led's coming on at the same time, figured that was
probably bad).

anyway, thanks in advance,
dan

please respond by email (dmr2@andrew.cmu.edu)
