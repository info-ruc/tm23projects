I tried this one and it worked for the  <\nowidctlpar> tag. It turns out,
however, that most of my problem is being caused by a persistent
unsupported <\-> tag (a dash), resulting from some sort of instability with
the Chinese character generating program ('TwinBridge') when it runs in
WordPad. I don't think it would help to include it so DMDX understands it,
however, because when the instability crops up it messes up the character
it appears in in any case. 

thanks for your help,

Jerry
