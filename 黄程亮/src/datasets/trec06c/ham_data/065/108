    I have read that it is not actually a solid cone angle, but a peak 
central lobe and a few side lobes.  I think the best way to figure this out 
is to mount your sonar sensor on a rotatable head and go out to an open 
field.  Place a single target (the corner of a cardboard box might make a 
good corner mirror) a known distance in the field.  Then scan your sonar 
sensor around a full circle logging measured distance versus angle.  This 
should give you a clear idea of the way your sonar responds.
    You may also need to figure the side lobe reactions into your navigation 
system.  If you would like, write me back and I'll look up the actual 
reference in which this is discussed.  I have forgotten off the top of my 
head.
