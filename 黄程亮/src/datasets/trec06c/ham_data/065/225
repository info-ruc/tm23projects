mmap(). truncate() is a bad name - it's setsize(). IOW, it can extend
files. Add the mmap() semantics in that respect and there you go -
open()/ftruncate() to set the size/mmap() the region/start working; is
quite common. Yes, you can kludge around it with lseek();write(); but
that's a kludge, unless we accept that zero-length write() changes the
file size. Which is not true under a lot of Unices (I seriously suspect
that it's explicitly prohibited by POSIX or something like that).
