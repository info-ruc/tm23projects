hi,
  i would like to buy a handyboard or borrow one(i'll pay for usage) for a
week from someone on this dlist.  my partner and i were going to use a HP
calculator as a controller for a robot, but we haven't been able to get
the compiler to work on the calculator, so we decided to look into this.
if you have a handyboard that you would like to sell, please email me soon
as you can. it's kinda of a emergency use..

thanks

jack
