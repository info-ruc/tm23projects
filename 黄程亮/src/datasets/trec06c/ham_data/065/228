Almost noting (except that you may want to change the size of existing
file and thus it turns into lseek(...,SEEK_END) and comparing the sizes).
However, I suspect that I know the reason why this question appeared -
implementation of 9p _client_. And ->setattr() or equivalents in many
variants of VFS allow changing the size. So it boils down to graceful
error value or finding a way to do it over 9p...

Usually OK for applications, but putting this kind of code into the
kernel... Ewww...
