I don't remember a VNC port, but I did see this post from David Bulkow
about getting VNC to work with Plan 9.  I don't know if he got the
network working.

Subject: [9fans] plan9 on vmware

I have finally managed to boot Plan9 in a VMware configuration.
The problem I ran into was the IDE driver attempting to set "read ahead
mode".  After the command to set the feature, the IDE device status
register indicates an error - the error register indicates Abort.
Once the abort error is posted, the driver can no longer access the
device and the boot fails.

I did not attempt to fix the problem correctly, but instead took
a short cut and commented out the call which sets read ahead mode.
Performance appears acceptable.

In boot/pc/hard.c comment out the call to hardsetbuf().  In 9/pc/devata.c
comment out the call to atafeature().

My next goal is to get ethernet working so I can have the VMware machines
participate in the rest of the Plan9 environment.
