Here's a stupid idea, but might be the simplest:  Run a dumb terminal program.
I keep a very old version of Telix for DOS around for this purpose.  Most of
the dumb terminal programs have some option or other for logging or capturing
to a file.

Now if you need to actually DO something as the data comes in, then you'll
have to write your own code.
