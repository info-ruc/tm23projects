We have a system that was designed to let you run IC-like code on a host
as if it were running on the HB. We use the HB as an extension to a larger
mobile robot (the HB turns on lights, motors, etc. Our robot served
candy via voice command at last year's AAAI Robot Competition.)

The system consists of a listener that runs on the HB, and a program to
send commands that runs on the Host. 

The system works MOST of the time; there are some timing issues that I
don't understand very well, and sometimes the communication gets off.
(Maybe someone who understands the serial communication could take a
look). 

You can get the source from http://ai.uark.edu/hb/

Works under Linux, and did under DOS at some point, but I haven't touched
the DOS part for awhile.
