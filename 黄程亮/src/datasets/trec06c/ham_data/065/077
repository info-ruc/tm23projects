I'm trying to reduce my environment to a single workstation with access
to an unreasonable number of distinct platforms (NetBSD, Linux, Win'95,
Win2K and Plan 9).  I thought VNC would provide the neatest (if not
the snazziest) solution.

Another option may be to port Cytrix to Plan 9 and the Unix platforms,
but that's hardly practical.

VMWare is great if you're short of servers, you can run everything on
one box, but then the performance suffers.  I have lots of redundant
(read old) equipment, but can only cope with one keyboard and screen
at the time (the mouse already makes it more difficult :-).
