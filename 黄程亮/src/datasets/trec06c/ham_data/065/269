   That's not a crash dude, when an error message is generated it's an 
error, not a crash.  Nor is it a bug, it's an unsupported tag in the .rtf file.

   1/ I change DMDX so it understands or at least parses out 
<\nowidctlpar>, I'd need an example of the offending .rtf file in that case 
(send it to me, not the list).
   2/ You start another file from scratch and don't do whatever it was that 
made Word stick this control word in.
   3/ Try saving it as a Word document (.doc file), close Word, re-open 
Word and then save it as an .rtf file and see if the <\nowidctlpar> tags go 
away.  Usually I'd recommend saving it as DOS text file but if you've got 
chinese in there that's unlikely to be an option.
