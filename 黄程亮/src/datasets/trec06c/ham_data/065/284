Hello,

Trying to get back to Plan9 (CD licensed in 1994).

I installed Plan9 on a PC from cd-rom. The disk has (hd0) has
a 100Mb DOS partition, 1500Mb available for installation. Using
the new disk-set (from ftp site), I was able to install the CD
contents on disk (saw one error for /n/kfs/sys/src/alef/?? and
one for /n/kfs/??/9pcdisk). Did opt for making the installed
file system default and rebooted. It prompts for boot device:
e!0 hd!0 h!0, I tried hd!0 and see the message

fs..time..init: /386/init file does not exist
....
.... exiting

The entry in c:>\plan9\plan9.ini for bootfile is still
bootfile=hd!0:/plan9.ini

Will a reinstall take care of the problem?
