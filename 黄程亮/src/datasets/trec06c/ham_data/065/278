Is there an easy way to get more torque out of a stepper motor?  Upping the
voltage is not an option at this time.  I've already decreased the width of
the pulses enough (so that it has enough torque to start on its own without
a push) that it goes rather slow.  Speeding up the pulses doesn't allow it
to start - maybe my wheels are too slippery?  Maybe putting some sort of
grip on them....  I'm just throwing out some ideas here - please throw out
some more if you've tried anything like this before...  oh yeah - setting up
a gear box is most likely out of the option due to my current time
constraints.

Thanks in advance for all your help.
