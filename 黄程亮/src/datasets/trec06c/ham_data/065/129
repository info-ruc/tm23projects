I totally agree.  I have a (literally) switch box, but it's a nightmare.
VNC is not quite the answer, either, as it and X add up to a formidable
resource famine :-)  I also can't bring myself to look at the Plan 9
Xserver (I do have only ix86 boxes to deal with), because my skills and
time availability make this impractical.

I do have a few monitors (and lots of identical keyboard, because I'm
sure their lifespan is limited).  While on topic, it is seldom that
mechanical switch boxes use break-before-make switching, and that has
caused the odd monitor to blow, in my experience.
