Hi there

Just saw your message and thought I could give you a few tips...

I also live in SA and have built a HandyBoard.
>From my experience so far, a robot built around the HandyBoard is very ea=
sy
to get going, has a wide range of posiblities and is easy to program. I
built both my HB and expansion board from boards bought from Douglas
Electronics, and parts bought here in SA. You could always buy a Complete
board or kit, if you cant find components...

Im not very clued-up on the processors, but yes the PIC's and 68HC11 are
just different familys of processors. But.. the pic I used was a  lot les=
s
powerfull than the 68HC11. If you  want to learn to program PIC's, there =
are
tons of kits you can learn from.

For a soccer playing robot, I dont think a PIC would be the right way to =
go,
but I dont know. It definately could be done with the HB.

Hope this helps

Ross

Subject: About HAndy board and PIC


I have read od a newsgroup of robotics that you
have build a robot with the Handy Board with a PIC.

What advcie can you give me . I have to start from scrath .
What I need to buy Handy Board + (what componets+tools??) to
build a soccer player ect..?? I do not have any electrical hobby
material or books or hardware or tools.  I'm a programmer so
I do now about programming.

What is difference between PIC and 6811. Is 6811 just a
number of a processor like intel 486+pentium ect.. differ
by name and architecture?? OR is PIC and 6811 different kind
of components??



I'm from South Africa and for me to buy these
kits or boards I have to buy through internet. It will also cost me 7 tim=
es
the price you will pay.    As I'm new to this and
I don't have lots of money to spend and then just to realize the package
is to limited to expand or used in futre advanced techniques.


I'm intersted in learning from scratch as well as have  a board that
can exapnd when I'm a more advanced user/programmer of the PIC.

Which of the boards are best to start with and are most expandable??
Can I build a Soccer player with Handy Board ?? or
must I buy lots of additional componets to do the same thing with Handy
How much one will spend on componets to build a SportKit?? ect..

How does the processor from the different above boards compare ?? Which h=
ave
the most
power and programmability??

I have some other questions as well. I have seen books publisehed how to
program
the PIC ?? Does that mean it's related to any microcontroller boards in
general or
only ones from MICROCHIP and related ones?? If I learn to program a handy
board-
6270 can one use below books on these boards too??



The books seems very good all titles I have read on site HVW electrical
http://www.hvwtech.com/books.htm#micros

Title: PIC'n Up The Pace  (PIC 16/17 Microcontroller Application Guide)

Title:  PIC'n Techniques"=A9 is an intermediate level applications guide

the unique features of the 8-pin microcontrollers.

Mobile Robots : Inspiration to Implementation by
Joseph J. Jones, Bruce A. Seiger, Anita M. Flynn. 457 pp. Softcover ISBN

How does Fred of MIT books("6.270 robot builder's guide".,  )
differ from above or where are the similarities??



I aprrecaite your sound advice and time for answering my email..


Thanks
