   For (1) you want to look at <ZillionOneResponse> and for (2) you want to 
look at <ZillionEnterKey>.

   See <zor>.

   You might have to unmap all the zillion buttons with <izk> first, 
there's code that allows multiple attempts to map the same button but it's 
possible that something's broke.  You'll also have to map the enter key as 
a valid zillion key.  If it actually doesn't recognize them then my guess 
is you somehow forgot to specify the keyboard as an input device as <zek> 
has code that maps +1 etc. as valid zillion keys.  That or, as I say, 
something has broken, not sure anyone has rigorously tested <zek> since I 
gave it feedback.  There is no way to reject 11 or 12 with <zek>, you'd 
have to use <zor> and forget about the enter key (which is the way ratings 
are gathered here so I know it works).
