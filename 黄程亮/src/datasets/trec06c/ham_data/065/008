Anybody know a way to store code in the non-volatile memory of the
handy-board?  If the board is not battery backed by the 12V pack I lose all
memory in RAM. Thanks guys.
 
P.S. I am also looking for a timing routine, a way to have a program run for
a specified period of time. Does the handy-board have anything like that
built in?
Brad
