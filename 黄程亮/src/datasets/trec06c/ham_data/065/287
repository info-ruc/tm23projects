By saying hd!0, you loaded a kernel from the DOS partition.  This is
perfectly reasonable.  However when it prompted for where the root
file system was from you probably hit newline.  The default in
that case is 'local!#H/hd0disk', i.e. the start of the disk, usually the
dos partition.  You'll be able to tell because it prints out the
default in the prompt.

If you load a kernel from the DOS partition, you'ld need to
override the default with the location of the plan 9 file system
you just installed, i.e., 'local!#H/hd0fs' or simply 'l'.

Alternately, you could boot a kernel from the plan 9 boot partition,
type 'h!0!boot'.  Then the default file system will indeed be /dev/hd0fs,
i.e., the file system you just installed.

Your plan9.ini entry is a bit odd too.  It should be:

	bootfile=h!0!boot

if you want to boot from the plan 9 kernel partition.
