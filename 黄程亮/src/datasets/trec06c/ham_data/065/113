I am trying to run a light with the motor outputs on the handy board. I
looked up the spec on the L293D and it claims to be capable of 600mA
constant and 1.2A peak. The miniature light I am using draws about 300mA.
When the light comes on the handy board just dies (looks like too much
current is being drawn). Any one have a similar experience? Know how to fix
it? 
Thanks Brad
