Can anyone on here reccomend a good textbook for a robotics class? The class is
intended for upperclass and graduate computer science students who have already
taken classes in artifical intelligence. We're going to be using LEGO kits and
HandyBoards in the class for hands on experience, but the text need not utilize
them directly. Most of the books we've found are geared towards engineering
rather than computer science students. We're looking for a book which teaches
common algorithms and concepts in robotics, around which we will develop
assignments using the book and kits.

Thx :)
