Dear DMDX friends,

I am having a lot of trouble with the 'RTF control word' problem (e.g., RTF
control word <\nowidctlpar> used in quoted text, not supported). 

When I first encountered this problem several weeks ago, I went to the help
files and followed the instructions to open in Word Pad and save it. That
worked for awhile, though it only worked if I edited and saved in Word Pad.
Then last week I started experiencing the same problem, and after
experimenting, found that Word Pad had somehow become the culprit and
editing and saving in Word (2000, 9.0) solved the problem! Now, neither one
will work and the program crashes every time.  

I have gone in with the DOS editor to have a look, and while I'm able to
find the offending rtf control words, it really is quite a mess in there
and it's hard to tell which of the many, many control words are ok and
which aren't. Saving as text doesn't help. 

I am using the program to display Chinese, but that shouldn't matter
because (a) it never bothered it before, and (b) the problem occurs whether
I have the Chinese-character-generating program on or not.

Any suggestions on how to solve this appreciated. 

thanks,

Jerry
