I would like to use DMDX for a ratings pre-test where participants give a
numerical response to auditory stimuli.

I've managed to set up the screen display and item presentation without any
trouble, but am having a problems getting various <zillion> response
options to behave as I would like. What I want to achieve is the following:

Subject types a number to make a response (between 1 and 7). DMDX then
moves on to the next item either:
1) immediately after the subject presses a number between 1 and 7 (but not
after pressing any other key) or 
2) after pressing return (but only if the subject has put in a single digit
as a response)

Both 1 or 2 are acceptable to me. I would rather use 2 (since it allows the
subjects to correct their responses) but don't really have a strong
preference either way. However, I've failed to get either of these options
and could do with some assistance.

(1) Accept only first key press:

<zil 1> to set up zillion mode to accept the first response only. 
<vzk +1> <vzk +2> etc. to set up only number keys 1-7 as being valid
responses.

However, I am then unable to get DMDX to move on only after the subject
responds. DMDX waits for a time out and then moves onto the next item,
whereas I would like to give the subject as much time as they want to
respond - and for DMDX to move on as soon as they have responded (to
encourage them to keep moving through the items). I have tried using <mpr>
to treat the number keys as positive responses, but that still doesn't move
on to the next item after a response (even though I'm using <cr> and <clfb>
which I *think* would operate in this fashion if I were using <azk>
output). How do I get DMDX to accept a single key press as a cue to move
onto the next item in zillion mode?

(2) Type number and press enter:

I've tried using <zil> to set up zillion mode and <zek> to use typed
responses followed by enter (with <notimelimit> and <FBOnlyClearBehind> to
retain typed responses on the screen). However, I then don't seem able to
use <vzk +1> etc. to allow subjects to only type digits - I get an error
about not recognising button names 1,2,3, etc. I also couldn't figure out
how to get DMDX to reject responses outside of the 1 to 7 range (i.e.
rejecting responses like 11, 12, etc.). Could this be done? Is there a
straightforward way of doing this with branching?

I would be grateful for any help you could give me in getting either of
these alternatives working.

Many thanks,

Matt
