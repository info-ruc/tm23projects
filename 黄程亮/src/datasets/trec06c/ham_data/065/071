Russ Cox once claimed he had ported VNC client to Plan 9 without much
difficulty, but with an 8-bit colour-map restriction, if memory serves.

Russ, is it so easy I can do it without help, or would you be able to
send me the details (I hope in my haste I have not overlooked the obvious,
that the changes are already in-the-box)?

Thanks.  Lucio.
