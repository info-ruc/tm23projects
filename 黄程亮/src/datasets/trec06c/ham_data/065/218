  does somebody know if there is a [f]truncate syscall in Plan 9? Or it it is not
  there, may be someone could suggest the similar functionality?

There is none, and there is no way to
implement it, as 9P does not support
such a thing.  I suppose if you were
really dying to have it, you could make
wstat pay attention to the length, but
that would be a departure from the
9P definition.
