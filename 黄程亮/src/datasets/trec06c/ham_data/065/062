Dear Joe Kopena:

We are here and are sorry you have found any difficulty in getting a 
prompt response. We have no record of having received email from you 
yourself. We have recently faxed a quote to another party at Drexel. 
Perhaps your email was lost, or perhaps our fax was misplaced? 

Sincerely,
W. Gleason
