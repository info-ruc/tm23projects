On the official plans on the HB web site, it says to connect 6 1N5401 diodes
for a voltage drop. Can I use 1N5404s instead? We got our sonar module the
other day and are itching to try it out. After visiting various Radio Shacks I
couldn't find the 5401s but I did find some 5404s. They say they're 3amp, like
the 5401s. Thanks, and please excuse my limited electrical knowledge :)
