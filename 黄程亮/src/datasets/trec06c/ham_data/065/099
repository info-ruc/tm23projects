Hi, could anyone tell me how I might light LED's in sequence so that they
would simulate a rev counter of an automobile & to also simulate the speed
counter. I need to know how I might wire them up and how I might be able to
program them using time delay to light each LED in sequence in a fashion which
would simulate the above. Thanks.
