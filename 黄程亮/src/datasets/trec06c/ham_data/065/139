those two things together strongly suggest that your crystal isn't
running.  any chance you can get a scope or logic probe to verify this
-- measure the E clock output of the 'hc11 (pin 5).

also, check that you've properly installed a 2.2 megaohm resistor for
the one that goes across the crystal.

if you're using a crystal (2 leads) and NOT the ceramic resonator (3
leads), make sure the associated 22pF caps are installed.  contrarily,
if you're using the resonator, make sure the caps are NOT installed.

other than that, could be a bad hc11, but much more likely it's the
above or a bad xtal/resonator.
