	int f=create("file", OREAD, 0666);
	if(n){
		seek(f, n-1, 0);
		write(f, "", 1);

What exactly is kludgy about this?

I've been using UNIX & Plan 9 for 26 years,
and not once have I wanted to chop the tail
off a file.  I find it really hard to believe
that you need this so badly that you want to
change 9p.  Why can't you afford to rewrite
the file?
