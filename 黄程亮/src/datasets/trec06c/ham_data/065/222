I have read od a newsgroup of robotics that you
have build a robot with the Handy Board with a PIC.

What advcie can you give me . I have to start from scrath .=20
What I need to buy Handy Board + (what componets+tools??) to
build a soccer player ect..?? I do not have any electrical hobby
material or books or hardware or tools.  I'm a programmer so
I do now about programming.

What is difference between PIC and 6811. Is 6811 just a
number of a processor like intel 486+pentium ect.. differ
by name and architecture?? OR is PIC and 6811 different kind
of components??



I'm from South Africa and for me to buy these
kits or boards I have to buy through internet. It will also cost me 7 =
times
the price you will pay.    As I'm new to this and=20
I don't have lots of money to spend and then just to realize the =
package
is to limited to expand or used in futre advanced techniques.


I'm intersted in learning from scratch as well as have  a board that
can exapnd when I'm a more advanced user/programmer of the PIC.

Which of the boards are best to start with and are most expandable??
Can I build a Soccer player with Handy Board ?? or
must I buy lots of additional componets to do the same thing with Handy
How much one will spend on componets to build a SportKit?? ect..

How does the processor from the different above boards compare ?? Which =
have
the most
power and programmability??

I have some other questions as well. I have seen books publisehed how =
to
program
the PIC ?? Does that mean it's related to any microcontroller boards in
general or
only ones from MICROCHIP and related ones?? If I learn to program a =
handy
board-
6270 can one use below books on these boards too??



The books seems very good all titles I have read on site HVW electrical
http://www.hvwtech.com/books.htm#micros

Title: PIC'n Up The Pace  (PIC 16/17 Microcontroller Application Guide)
Author: David Benson=20

Title:  PIC'n Techniques"=A9 is an intermediate level applications =

describes
the unique features of the 8-pin microcontrollers.

How does Fred of MIT books("6.270 robot builder's guide".,  )
differ from above or where are the similarities??=20



I aprrecaite your sound advice and time for answering my email..


Thanks
