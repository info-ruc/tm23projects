One word "Chopper"

Nearly every commercial stepper motor driver I have ever seen uses a 
chopper circuit. This is because torque is related to current (actually its 
related to magnetic flux but that's related to current :-). The operation 
of a chopper is pretty simple, you slam a "huge" voltage on your motor with 
a circuit the measures the current through the motor, (voltage comparator 
across a .1 ohm resistor is good for this) and then when it gets to the max 
current you "chop" the voltage off. (usually by turning off a MOSFET) When 
the current gets a bit below where you want it you turn the voltage back 
on. (this provides "holding" torque) It is all a simple feedback circuit 
and requires no software at all.
