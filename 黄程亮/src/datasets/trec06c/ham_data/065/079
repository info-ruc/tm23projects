> Russ Cox once claimed he had ported VNC client to Plan 9

That was me.  In fact I wrote a Plan 9 VNC viewer from scratch (685 lines
of C) rather than trying to port the Unix/Xwindows one (3188 lines).

It was quite straightforward to do the communication and display parts
from the spec.  My minimal interface could be made more useful by adding
a way to pan across the screen if the viewer window is too small, and
a way to emulate extra keyboard ops required by some host systems.
