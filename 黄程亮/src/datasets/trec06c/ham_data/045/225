I spoke with our branch manager and he said return the over ordered
merchandise for credit.

> cpus came with their own (13) ethernet cards installed. we also
> wanted to add memory to each machine (which you installed in each
> machine), but we also received a package with 10 additional 
> memory cards. this leads to two questions. it appears that we
> have paid for extra ethernet cards and memory boards that we
> don't need. what is the best way to deal we this? should we

> order? i have sent the first purchase order (with just the 
> cpus on it) to our accounting department so you will be paid
> for that part of the order. let me know what you think?
