Subject: Sharp GP1U58 Hack without modifing my board

I have two questions.  I hope someone can help.

First:
Is there a way to use a Sharp GP1U58 hacked to give analog values WITHOUT 
cutting the trace to the resistor pack on the analog inputs?  Perhaps 
using an OP AMP.  Also would removing the resistor pack completely, effect 
the operation of the board.

Second:
I have a handyboard that doesn't function properly.  I can load IC on to 
it but none of testdigitals, testmotors, or testanalogs work.  I have 
removed 
all the chips and put them in a board that works.  So I have ruled out 
the chips themselves.  Also when completeing the tests pin 9 on U5 is 
always high.  This board was working and them it stopped.  I believe it 
may have suffered a short circuit.
