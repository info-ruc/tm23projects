Yes, this is the method we used along after hacking up a cubic approximation using
Graphical Analysis.  The lookup table is plenty accurate and also demonstrates that

some problems are best solved using nothing more than a ruler and a few  spare
minutes.  The cubic was really no more accurate for our purposes.  It isn't elegant
but it got us through
the maze at the Trinity Firefighting contest.
