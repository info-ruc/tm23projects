Subject: Using IC with the 6811 Eval board

I've been using Interactive C with the Handy Board and like the 
convenience of C commands.  I am now trying to work with Motorola's
HC11EVBU evaluation board (same 6811 chip, different interface).  It has a
program called BUFFALO which is a watered-down assembly code that runs in
ROM, but I want to be able to use C.

My Question:  Has anyone been successful in downloading the P-Code to the
6811 Eval Board and actually using Interactive C with the board?

Otherwise, what other options are available for using a C compiler with 
the HC11EVBU?

I appreciate any comments.  Thank you.
