Matt:
It sounds like maybe you have a DS1233M instead of a DS12323.  The
"M" part is a replacement for the MC34064 and has a different pinout
than the regular DS1233.  I have both versions, DS1233 for the Handy
Board and DS1233M for the Finger Board.  I cannot tell them apart by
their markings!  Only with an ohmmeter.  They both look like diodes
between pin-1 and pin-3; on the DS1233 pin-3 looks like the cathode,
on the DS1233M pin-1 looks like the cathode.   Does that make sense?
On the HandyBoard part; low resistance (1K5) from pin-3 to pin-1, 
and open from pin-1 to pin-3.
