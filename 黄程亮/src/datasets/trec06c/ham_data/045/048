Dear Carlos,

I will make it available.  I have managed to improve on the code so I have
better control, but have a way to go yet before it is finish.

So far, I am able to send data reliably at 62,500 bits per second without
interrupts.  I expect to get to the whole 1 meg bits per second as soon as I
have everything figured out.

Regards,

Gary
