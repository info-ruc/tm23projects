Allow me to be redundant (others on the list are tired of hearing about it
I'm sure):  Go to www.eskimo.com/~archer, and snag the HC11 patches to the
GCC-2.8.1 compiler.  In there is a readme that tells how to get it going
on a Linux box.  It shouldn't be too hard to get it going on any other
platform that is supported by GCC (most unix-like operating systems).
You'll also need to go snag the GCC-2.8.1 sources, but they are readily
available.

There's also a Handyboard library there for download, which might give
you some hints on how to get going with the EVB board.

An alternate path to the software:  ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/u/a/archer

There are also commercial C compilers that you can use.

If you want a DOS GCC compiler (DJGPP) for the HC11, I can point you to
that as well.

I ported quite a large program from Interactive-C over to GCC and have
it running on my Handyboard.  It's quite a bit faster, and I still have
a lot of memory available.
