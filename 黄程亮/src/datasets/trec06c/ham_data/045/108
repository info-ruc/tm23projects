Dear Professor Forster,

We've been trying to set up a naming experiment using DMDX on a laptop PC 
but have been unsuccessful to date. We were wondering if it was possible to 
run the naming experiments using a sound card instead of a voice key (PIO 
card). Thanks in advance.

Best regards,

Angelo Alonzo
