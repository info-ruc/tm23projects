2). The GP2D02 works well too and is very useful in the short range....

        Has anyone had any success at converting the output of this sensor to
inches or some other linear unit of measure? It would be very helpful if
somebody assisted my mathematically challenged self.




Well Bob, we had the same problem, so we used MATLAB to generate a polynom from
the data points of the graph we found on the sharp data sheet.
we got the following coefficients:

  1.0e+003 *

    0.0000    0.0000    0.0000   -0.0001    0.0058   -0.3032    6.6195

these are the coefficients of x^0,x^1,x^2...,x^6
when :
y=ax^0+bx^1+cx^2+..+fx^6

if x is your reading, then y will be the distance in cm.
I think... :-)

Hope this helps.
Guy
