     FIRST SOUTHERN AFRICAN SUMMER SCHOOL AND WORKSHOP ON 

  LOGIC, UNIVERSAL ALGEBRA, AND THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE

                        (LUATCS'99)

    Rand Afrikaans University, Johannesburg, South Africa 

                     December 1-10, 1999


                     SECOND ANNOUNCEMENT
                  AND CALL FOR PARTICIPATION


LUATCS'99 is organized under the auspices of the Department of
Mathematics at the Rand Afrikaans University (RAU) in Johannesburg,
South Africa, the National Research Foundation of South Africa (NRF),
the Laboratory for Formal Aspects and Complexity in Computer Science
(FACCS-Lab) at the University of Cape Town, and the Interest Group in
Logic, Universal Algebra and Theoretical Computer Science at the South
African Mathematical Society (SAMS).


  ADVISORY BOARD:
  Samson Abramsky (University of Edinburgh, UK)
  Hajnal Andreka (Math. Inst. of the Hungarian Acad. of Sciences)
  Johan van Benthem, Chair (University of Amsterdam, Netherlands) 
  Chris Brink (University of Wollongong, Australia) 
  Robin Hirsch (University College London, UK) 
  Wilfrid Hodges (Queen Mary and Westfield College, UK) 
  Bjarni Jonsson (Vanderbilt University, USA) 
  Istvan Nemeti (Math. Inst. of the Hungarian Acad. of Sciences) 
  Jeff Zucker (McMaster University, Canada)

  ORGANIZING COMMITTEE: 
  Isabella Burger (Rand Afrikaans University, local arrangements),
  Val Goranko (Rand Afrikaans University, co-chair), 
  Peter Jipsen (University of Cape Town, co-chair).


I. ACTIVITIES: Short introductory and advanced courses, tutorials and
workshops on each of the three subjects: Logic, Universal Algebra and
Theoretical Computer Science, as well as combined courses and
tutorials/workshops on specific topics within the scope of the
school. Also, there will be open sessions with contributed talks.

The courses and tutorials will be given by invited lecturers and will
be grouped in two parts: introductory and advanced.

The purpose of the single-subject courses is to give a concise
introduction into the basics, and some advanced topics of the subject
for participants with little or no background (for the introductory
courses) and with basic knowledge (for the advanced courses) in the
subject.

The purpose of the interdisciplinary courses, tutorials, and workshops
is to discuss the interaction between the subjects of the school.

A general purpose of the school is to reflect the current development
of each of the three subjects and the interaction between them, with
an emphasis on recent trends and research topics in them.

The introductory part is aimed at lower graduate (honours and masters)
students but will be accessible for undergraduates majoring in
mathematics and computer science too. Essentially no special
knowledge, but some formal background, will be expected for these
courses. The advanced part will be suitable for higher graduate
(masters and doctoral) students and researchers.


1) PART 1: Introductory courses. December 1-4, RAU-Island (Vaal Dam,
see below).  Each course will comprise four sessions and will give a
general background into the subject(s), necessary to follow the
advanced courses.

  COURSES AND LECTURERS:

2.3) CREDITS: 
The courses offered at the school can be taken for official credit and
recognized (by prior arrangements with respective heads of
departments) as modules for graduate courses, after successful
completion of assignments given by the respective lecturers.


II. TIME: December 1-10, 1999. 9 working days, and a free/relocation
day on December 5. (Note that this is an early summer time in the
Southern hemisphere.)


III. PLACES AND ACCOMMODATION:  

Part I: December 1-4 1999, RAU-Island. This is a fairly large island
in the Vaal Dam, some 100 km south of Johannesburg. The island is a
nature reserve, with various game on it to be seen: springboks,
blesboks, gemsboks, zebras, gnus, etc. Besides the wilderness, it also
has conference, accommodation, and recreation facilities including: 3
lecture rooms with boards and overhead projectors (one of them with an
aircon); full board (accommodation and 3 meals a day), barbecue area,
swimming pool, rugby field, volley-ball court etc.

ARRIVAL AND REGISTRATION: November 30. We shall provide bus
transportation for all participants from RAU campus to the Island on
that day. There will be two buses, the first leaving at 12.00, and the
second at 16.00. We can transport, upon prior request, participants
from the Johannesburg International Airport to RAU on November 30,
between 10.00 and 15.00h. (Please book your trip to Johannesburg so as
to reach RAU campus in time, because there is no regular transport to
the Island.)

On December 5 all participants will be transported back to RAU campus.

ACCOMMODATION: 
The accommodation on the island is somewhat primitive (yet
satisfactory, at least in summer time) and includes a few individual
rooms (which will be reserved for invited lecturers), while the
participants will be accommodated in two large sleeping barracks (for
men and women) each with toilet and shower facilities. The FULL
PACKAGE (transportation by bus-boat between RAU and the Island,
accommodation, 3 meals and refreshments for 5 days) will cost R550
pp. Note that the access between the mainland and the island is by a
special boat only, which can be hired at a cost.

NB: Because of the limited accommodation facilities on the island, the
number of participants in the first part of the school will be
limited, so early registration for that part is essential.

PART II: December 6-10, 1999, RAU campus. The university campus is
situated in Auckland Park, a relatively quiet and safe suburb off the
business center of Johannesburg. It has very good conference
facilities, and the participants will be provided with computers and
access to Internet during this part of the event. For more info about
RAU, visit its Web site at http://www.rau.ac.za.

ARRIVAL AND REGISTRATION: December 5. There will be a Welcome
reception at RAU during and after the registration of that evening.

ACCOMMODATION: 
We offer 3 main options for the accommodation during the 2nd part of
the school:

A) Hotel. The following special rates have been negotiated with
Randburg Towers Hotel (3 star, near Waterfront in Randburg, about 30
min drive to RAU), between which and RAU we shall provide twice daily
bus transport.

	Single rooms: R244 pp/pd, incl. breakfast.  
        Double and twin rooms: R230 per room/pd, excl. breakfast @ R29
	per person.

	All rooms are with bath en suite, aircon, telephone, and TV. 

B) There are limited possibilities for accommodation in guest-houses
within walking distance from the university, offering good, more
intimate environment, with prices ranging from R200-300 pp/pd,
breakfast included. The guest-houses have limited capacities and will
be booked on the basis of first registered - first booked.

C) Student hostels of the University of Witwatersrand (Wits), about
10-15 min drive from RAU. A DAILY PACKAGE of single room, breakfast,
and bus transportation to and from RAU during December 5-10 will cost
R100 pp/pd. In addition, dinners can be booked at the hostels at
R25. The last night for which we have booked the hostels is December
10/11. Those who wish to stay there longer should make their own
arrangements.

For more luxurious accommodation and additional options, check out our
Web-page, but please note that if you choose an accommodation not
listed above, you should make your own booking and transport
arrangements.
