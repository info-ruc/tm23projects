Umm, not sure what exactly you are asking here. If you have programs loaded
in the HB, then you also have the pcode downloaded. At the IC prompt type
"unload filename.c" and the file will be removed from the HB.

This was done ten years ago on squirt, a very tiny MIT (olympic robot
competition era) robot. The sound was localized via the difference in
amplitude between two microphones. This circuit is in the olympic robot
building manual (A.I. Lab memo #1230)and the paper on squirt (memo #1120).
A similar circuit was used on the rug warrior, I think. That circuit is
available on the EAS site at:

rface.pdf

I think a better (more directionally accurate) method would be to use
timing differences and use three microphones. To that end I've been
considering programming a PIC to do the timing and then just (serially?)
output the direction information to the HB. 

Hope this helps, Duncan
