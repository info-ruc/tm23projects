Subject: Using SPI
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; x-mac-type="54455854"; x-mac-creator="4D4F5353"

I am using the SPI port to communicate with another Handy Board.  I have
written a routine in IC that will pass bytes between controllers just as
it is supposed to work.  However, the code is not very clean and it is
very touchy.  Change one thing and it may not work.  Has anyone else put
together working IC code to communicate between controllers?

Thanks,

Gary Livick

ps: Hello Fred.
