Dear Prof. Forster:

   I am a new user of DMDX and very grateful for your hard workon this
excellent software. I meet a problem and fail to figure it outby the
information on your homepage.
   I have got a new computer which has sound card and runwin98, but no PIO 
card or voice key. If I want to use joystick or game pad as input device, 
can I run experiments on naming task? If I can, how can I doit? Just connect 
the microphone to sound card directly or need otherdevice?
   I am looking forward to your reply, thank you very much.

   Michael
