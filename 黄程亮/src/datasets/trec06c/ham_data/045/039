Gary,

We used the PA7(transmitting board) and PD0(receiving board) in wireless
and wired mode.  This is quite easy to do.  Pete Eacmen have done the wired
stuff while I did the wireless stuff.

With wired one, you can transmit @9600 baud with no problem.

I would like to try the SPI port but my transciever module can only
transmit reliably at 300 baud, so I used the Asynchronous (PD0..) stuff.
