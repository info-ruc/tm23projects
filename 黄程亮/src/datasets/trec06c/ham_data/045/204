    Thank You, i have downloaded the circuit from the URL :

www.hooked.net/~jfong/public/Computers/fingerboard/schematics/fb_interfac=
e.p
df


, and i have another question, can the 5 V. pin of the analog input drive
this circuit, How much current can draw this pin? Maybe I must take the
power from another source.



                        Thank You


                                                                    Jos=E9
