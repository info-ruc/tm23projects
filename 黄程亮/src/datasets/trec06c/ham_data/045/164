Hi,

        Is there a way to remove a program from the memory of the HB
without downloading the PCode? , for example i have two programs in memory,
and i want to remove only one of them, is it possible?
        Also i am looking for a way to use 2 or 3 electret mics to make the
robot follow sounds, I know that is needed a preamp between mic and analog
input, but I'm not sure about the circuit to be used. Has someone tried
this?


                                            Thank You

                                                               Jose Luis
