Christopher Prosser's question about MIDI started me thinking
about adding some sound effects from the speaker.  I know the
capabilities of the on-board sound are limited, but has
anyone done any work on simple sound effects (splat, boing, 
au-oh, etc)?  

I have some 5th graders I need to do a demo for, and it would 
be a nice (although corny) addition to the demo.
