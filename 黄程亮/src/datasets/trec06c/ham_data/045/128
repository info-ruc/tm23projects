Please don't post your request to be removed from the handiboard group
to the handiboard mailing list.  This sends a copy to EVERYONE on the
list.  It's rude, and bothersome.  I'd suggest sending the request for
removals to the same email address that you originally applied to for
the subscription.

I am benefiting from the experiences that people are sharing about these
boards.  However, it really irks me to get these damned unsubscribe
requests.

            Thanks!
