Hi Bill,

I thought I would send you some notes about the changes that I have made
to the focus command in the optical pointing daemon.  I have added two
parameters to the /etc/opdrc file.

  BACKLASH0 - This is the same as the term used to date.  The value we
              have been using so far is -2000.  I've changed the sign
              to see how it works.
  BACKLASH1 - Relaxation term you requested.  This should have the same
              sign as BACKLASH0.

If you log onto kueppers as smtobs, you will have write access to opdrc.
If you edit opdrc, the opd will reread the file so there is no need to
restart opd.

There are now only two options to the focus command.  The following is the
response help command.

help focus
  focus [-a] [-m steps]
    opt a       - autofocus mode
    opt m       - manual focus mode
      steps     - number of steps to move

The manual focus uses the new backlash terms, but the autofocus doesn't.
I am not done with the modifications to the autofocus mode. 

I have attached a copy of the current opdrc file.

-Dave.
