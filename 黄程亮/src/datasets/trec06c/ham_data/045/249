Hi Jonathan,

I think digital VOX is a great idea. Especially because it gives so much
flexibility in measuring naming response times copmared to an electronic
voice key. 

As far as configuration issues go, I think it's probably best to keep
novice users away from TimeDX if possible, and to not use TimeDX to set
thresholds on a subject by subject basis. Out of your suggestions then:

> Options include:
>	(1) Only allowing it to be set in TimeDX, providing a VU display feedback
>and so forth and the resulting threshold stored in the registry and all

>	(1a) Same as (1) but having another button in the DMDX main dialog to

>	(2) Allowing DMDX to enter a special mode similar to a testmode (ie, as

I think setting an overall level and threshold in TimeDX is the right way
to go - ie. option 1. I think adding an item file parameter (option 4) is
not very useful. The setup is likely to be machine specific and hence best
configured and stored in the registry. However, like frame duration, I
think digital vox settings should be written to the .azk file when used.

It should also be possible to adjust thresholds on a subject by subject
basis without going into TimeDX - I guess this would require something like
option 1a or option 2 in addition to option 1. Maybe you should have a
button in the test mode that will make changes permanent by writing to the
registry, but not do this by default. That way it will be easy to make
changes for a particular subject and return to the default values
subsequently.

As for option 3, I think a big advantage of Digital VOX is that if the
voice key stops working correctly then you can still rescue the results,
simply by running an analysis after the end of the experiment on the sound
files that have been recorded to the computers hard drive. Maybe this makes
changing the threshold during the experiment less important - though I
guess having this available would be useful.

There is a piece of software called RunWord, developed by Chris Kello that
takes this approach - storing sound files and analysing them later. Runword
includes a iece of software called RunVoice that does a two stage (forward
then backwards) parse of the acoustic signal allowing very sophisticated
acoustic measures to be taken from speech files.

It may be that looking at the way that Runword is set up may be useful to
you (or maybe allowing DMDX to use runvoice for acoustic analysis). You can
find more info on it here:

http://www.cnbc.cmu.edu/~kello/runword.html

there is also a paper on the software that describes the acoustic analysis
in more detail.

Kello, C. T., & Kawamoto, A. H. (1998). Runword: An IBM-PC software package
for the collection and acoustic analysis of speeded naming responses.
Behavior Research Methods, Instruments and Computers, 30, 371-383. 

Hope this is of use. I'm looking forward to trying out Digital Vox as soon
as it is ready for testing.

All the best,

Matt
