  Use a voice key connected to the game port of a sound card or wait till I
build a digital voice key (but that will be weeks).  You will have to use
the <MapVoiceKey> keyword (something like <mvk button 1> with an <id
joystick> in the parameter line) and I recommend getting a joystick and
gutting it to interface the VOX to the gameport replacing one of the
joystick switches with the VOX's relay.  As for a voice key LaFayette make
a reasonable unit with relay outputs.
