  I cannot find any Specs on the hitachi display; therefore it is making it 
hard for me to find an alternative.  Firstly what pixel ratio could I get 
away and still be able to read the display.  Or should I get a display that 
uses cursors.  Less flexibility in output.

  Also I intend to automate my automobile, Its a 1981 Jeep CJ-7 I rebuilt it 
myself and now I want to rebuild the indicators, Tach, Speedometer, Fuel 
gauge, Temperature gauge, and fluid levels.  Also I want to operate a 
security system, with remote.  Does anybody know where I could get a FM 
coded remote with three buttons?  Arm disarm, and start.  How about 
something to turn the mechanical speedometer to electrical?  The tach should 
be easy just count the pulses and multiply by 2.

    Lastly people talk about the unsubscriber using too much bandwidth, the 
responses that get sent out are also useless.  The only person who would 
read such a response would be the individual who cares.  Obviously the 
unsubscribers do not care and consider the e-mail from this list junk, why 
else would they unsubscribe.  I have noted that for every 1 unsubscribe 
there are at least 2 complaints.  If you want to let people know how to 
unsubscribe put it in your signature and don't bother sending an entire 
e-mail on it.

    That portion was the people who care about the list this is for the 
people who dislike it.
