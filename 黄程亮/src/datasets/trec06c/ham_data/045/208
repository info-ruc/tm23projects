  Initial research (it's summer and things are kinda slow and I was bored)
by me into the creation of a digital VOX and the ability to record subject
vocalization show that it is indeed possible with something as lowly as a
Sound Blaster 16.  Might only be a week or so before there's something for
people to test.
