Subject: real spam on the list

hi all,

as is now evident, handyboard@media.mit.edu has been picked up by
genuine spammers.

so i'm going to have to bit the bullet and install better list software.

hopefully this will have the side-effect of trapping 'unsubscribe' msgs,
though if people continue to be creative and ask 'please quit me' that'll
probably slip through :-).

sorry about the spam.  please bear with me while i try to get something
better installed.

yours,
fred
