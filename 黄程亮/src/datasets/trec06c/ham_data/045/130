Hi all(Again!),
  I'm having a problem with the hbtest.c program on my handyboard, I'm at
stage 7.2.2  of assembly, where you load the above file using ic, and it
wont load it. DL works fine, and ic will download other .c files, and I can
type c expressions at the ic command prompt, and these work, but when I try
to load hbtest.c by typing "load hbtest.c" it gives several errors, talking
about undefined processes within hbtest.c, and then unloads the program.
I've downloaded the latest version of the file from the MIT site, and have
the same prob. Any ideas? Thanks again!
    Matt
