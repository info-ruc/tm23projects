stargazer t-shirt
a gps stargazing assistant t-shirt.  the shirt keeps track of date, time
and place. no matter where you are you can look at your shirt to find out
what constellations to search for at that time in the sky . maybe when
touched the allegorical shapes of the constellations can appear around the
star configuration (h.a. rey)

story beads
beads that have an image loaded into them via ir. strung together and worn
- the images are played out as a story on a tiny lcd amulet. trade 'em with
your friends (been talking to kwin about this as a research project for the
semester as an adaptation for another set of programmable beads). while
latoya is doing her science project she can keep images of her research and
pictures/notes about other women scientists in history.  empowerment
necklace - but better than wonder woman's.

world garden 
pick a location on the spinning world - zoom in and plant seeds. check in
later, irrigate, maybe put down some mulch. see how they are growing and
surviving based on real climate and weather conditions in that world
location. sim garden with real world influence - but beautiful graphics.
maybe collaborative. one could spell a message for a friend that would only
be revealed when the flowers bloomed or died. (andrew witkin)

toy-tags
a creation id tag for homemade toys - the idea is to give some information
about the history of the toy construction. so, materials can be traded and
challenge the next player. maybe a small audio file for playback of
challenge - "i made a fish from this piece of silk in 20 folds..." (pengkai
pan)

holographic marbles
edge lit holograms embedded in marbles.  used on a circular light board.
images are distorted to abstraction in all cases except when the edge of
the hologram is perpendicular to the light board - then you get the
holographic image.

firefly crayons
little plastic bugs, light on back, teeny ink jet underneath.  two modes -
set and variable.  set means you choose a color red, yellow, blue, black,
white. variable works on proximity. if a variable bug is close to a blue
and yellow bug it would turn green.  you could always press on the backs of
the bugs and draw with ink in the color displayed on the back.  maybe they
could move autonomously like bugs and draw patterned pictures (a possessed
spirographic bug collection)

eleanor's paper dragon
pen that deposits dragon's in a digital storybook land.  the dragons
traverse the world and depending on where they are initially placed pick up
characters on their backs, dance and fight making weather in the world
change. they always (if they survive) end the story in a factory where they
make and fly paper airplanes. the airplanes can be digitally unfolded and
the player can write messages on them to keep and see next time they use
the book. the message planes sometimes fly around during the stories and
slay a dragon. (bettelheim)

musical markers
each color has a different sound that plays while you draw. notes could
vary in some way depending on gesture. (does anyone remember those scented
markers of the 70's - fun!)

soap bubble stamps
color images printed on soap bubbles. as the bubbles get formed the images
swirl into abstract colorful patterns. they float away and burst, but when
the ink dries it becomes invisible.

comic-cam
a wireless camera for taking, augmenting and trading of images (no camera
storage, just in the moment storytelling). you can add blurbs of text.
images can be sent to a central server for time relative comic sequencing.
