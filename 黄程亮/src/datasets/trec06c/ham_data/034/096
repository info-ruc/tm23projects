Please explain.  Now I'm worried about damaging my sonar board.  Since
the foil cable has conductors on only one side, I didn't think that it
was possible to plug it in "backwards" and still make an electrical 
connection.  

My understanding of the hookup is as follows:
On the HB Expansion Board pin 1 (gnd) of the Polaroid connector is
toward the top of the board.  On the Polaroid Ranging Module pin 1
is toward the left.  If the foil cable is connected so that the
dotted edge of the cable is nearest the pin 1 end of each connector,
I fail to see how there is any danger of damaging the sonar board.

Thanks for your help.
