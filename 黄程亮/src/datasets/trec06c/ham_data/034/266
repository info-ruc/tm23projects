ideas off the top of my head:

1) toys that non-rich people can afford
2) toys that help kids learn about health/medicine, biosensors
3) toys that help kids learn about science (e.g. electricity, weather)
4) toys that allow kids to communicate with other kids around the world
5) toys that allow kids to communicate with animals, plants
6) electrical wind-up toys (i.e. no more batteries)
7) millimeter-size remote-controlled vehicles
8) a toy which measures how much you have learned each day
