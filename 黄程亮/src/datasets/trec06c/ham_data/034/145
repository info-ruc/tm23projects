The Dinsmore 1490 (basically a Hall effect unit) reports the 8 cardinal
compass points, a 45 degree precsion (N-NE-E-SE-S-SW-W-NW). If you
wanted more precision then you have to upgrade to the Dinsmore 1525 or
1655 which produce analog signals. They cost $35 each. By the time you
bought the associated components to interface it you will have invested
more than what the Precision Navigation V2X with costs ($49.95) which is
very simple to interface with readily available source code.

Just a thought.
