Subject: sensors for tennis ball
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-jp
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello everyone,

I am wondering if anybody have done something like a sensor that can
detect a tennis ball, probably 10 - 15 cm. away.

If someone have done this one, kindly sent some information.  I am
trying to build a multi-robot, where one should get the tennis ball and
pass it to the other who will dump the ball to some pre-specified place.
  I already finished with the DUMPER thing but I am still looking for a
sensor that can locate the tennis ball (not the vision sensor  - it's a
bit expensive)

Thanks in advance and am looking forward on it.
