I am using Newton Labs IC 3.2.  Thinking that the reason the expansion
board files were not working was that they were not compatible with Newton
Labs IC, I tried to get the freeware version to work.  I changed my com
port settings to try to get the freeware version to work(without luck
because of the bad expansion board files). After downloading the latests
expansion board files I forgot to change the com port settings back.  After
changing the settings back, the expansion board now works fine.  Thanks for
the help.
