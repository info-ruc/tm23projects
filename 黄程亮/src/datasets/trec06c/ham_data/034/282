--Electronic Puzzle
You get one set of pieces, but you can download several pictures 
to them. They get assigned in a random way, every time you 
want to star a new puzzle. Once you are done with one picture, 
you can upload it to the your computer (print, etc) 

--Grow your plans
You get a traveling container to place your plans. They have 
different parameters (humidity, light, etc.) you can control 
according to the plant needs.

--Composition kit
Different object will represent the different components in a music 
piece (duration, peach, and volume...). The idea is to have the kids 
learn about these different elements and by playing can compose 
and create their own melodies (my group proposed a similar idea 
in Mitchel's class last semester).

--Automatic Pop-up Book
The idea here is similar to the pop-up book, but instead of you having 
to pull thing and get motion when you open a new page, the motion 
will happen automatically.

--Movie Clip/Camera/Album
The idea is to be able to have album with movie clips in the same way 
you have pictures. I imagine them in a format similar to a Polaroid picture.

--Personal Music Box
You can download the music you like and program the box to play 
it according to different parameters... can be environmental, emotional, 
etc.

--Robotic fish tank
With fish, octopus, see horse that you can train to do different things.

--Real Super Heroes, and other dolls
They will actually perform as they do in cartoons or movies. 
You can select demo or control mode. I got this one from my 
brother, who wants to have spider-man that can claim walls 
or super-man that flies.
