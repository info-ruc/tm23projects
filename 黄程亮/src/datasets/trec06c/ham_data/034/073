I bought their Robot Platform (roomy and sturdy!) which came with two gearbox
motors. I, too, am using the HB w/exp. If the motors you received are the same
as the ones that are used on their Platform then you will have trouble using
them via the HB motor pins. In my case, the motors became spastic while the HB
kept resetting itself. The reason is that those motors run on a lower voltage
than what the HB provides. I was able to kludge two different motors ( which I
had purchased from Gleason Research Inc.) into the same gearboxes. It solved my
problem.

G'Luck,
