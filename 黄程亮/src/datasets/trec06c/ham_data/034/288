Here's an idea for a digital olympic torch that I've been "toying" with...

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE DIGITAL TORCH 

Here's an idea for a major worldwide event to help launch the Sydney
2000 Olympics.

Before each Olympics, a small group of runners carry a torch from
Athens to the host country. We would like to add a collection of
digital torches, carried by millions of kids all over the world. The
kids would carry the digital flames on their wrists, in specialized
Olympic Swatches. To pass the flame, kids would simply bring their
wrists together, and the flame would jump from one watch to
another. The ultimate goal: to pass the flames all the way to Sydney.

Swatch would produce five different Torch Watches, each one resembling
a different colored ring on the Olympic flag. To create a new flame, a
group of five kids wearing the five different color watches must put
their hands together. A new flame glows on the watch faces, along with
a unique URL. On the Web, kids could add pictures and messages to
"their" flames -- and see visualizations of all of the flames. Each
flame, over time, would represent a community of kids from around the
world.

There are games associated with the flames. Kids gain points each time
they pass a flame; with enough points, they can start a new
flame. Flames must be cared for; if they are not passed frequently,
they die out.

During the opening ceremony, the lights will dim, and hundreds of
children in the stadium will hold up their hands, their watches
glowing red. These children (chosen for the key roles they played in
the torch relay) will each be carrying one of the flames that made it
all the way to Sydney. They will then run down onto the field, and one
by one, will touch their watches to a large digital torch (a tall,
thin Jumbotron). An enormous animated flame will ignite on the screen,
where each piece of the flame will be an image of a child who carried
it (like an animated version of the photomosaics created at the Media
Lab).

This activity would connect kids together into a worldwide community
-- and help them understand how local interactions can achieve global
results.
