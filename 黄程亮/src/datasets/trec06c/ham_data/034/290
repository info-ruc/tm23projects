Hive is a framework for the development of distributed systems of Things
That Think. Hive is designed to make it as easy as possible to connect
new devices to the Hive, and provides services so that those devices can
discover each other and interact. Hive is designed to facilitate the
seperation of device capabilities and their behavior, making it easy to
change the behavior of a system already in the field. Finally, Hive is
designed with massive scalability and widely distributed systems in
mind.

We are actively seeking people whose projects could benefit from Hive.
If you are not sure if Hive would be useful to you, please contact us.
The project home page is http://hive.www.media.mit.edu/projects/hive/
and the authors are available at hive@media.mit.edu

The web page has links to both binary and source distributions of Hive,
as well as the documentation still in progress. If you decide to
download the code, please add yourself to our users mailing list which
is hive-users@media.mit.edu

Thanks,

Oliver Roup
The Hive Team.
