The dinsmore devices are really easy to work with.  This one has 4
hall effect devices in it, and the output is digital. If you align it
with cardinal coordinates you can tell North, East, South, and West
very easily only one device is triggered, and the NW, NE, SE, NW
coordinates when two devices are triggered.

Simply bias the the devices, and read the digital output at any device
output.
