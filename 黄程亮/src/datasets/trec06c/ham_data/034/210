Subject: download without interface board
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"


	I was wondering if there is a way to directly connect to the handyboard,
without the interface/charger board. Perhaps using the interface cable from
a miniboard. can I download a program the same as the miniboard. If anyone
has any experience with this i'd like some advice.
Thanks,
Lectro
