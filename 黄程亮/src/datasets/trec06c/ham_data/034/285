I haven't looked at anyone else's ideas yet, so if there are duplicates,
it's convergent thinking! :)

- Safe wookdworking tools.
  I've seens a stapler meant for kids in which it's absolutely impossible
to staple your fingers, yet it works perfectly.  It would be fun to apply
this concept to other dangerous tools so kids can have fun with those
activities too.

- tangible music composing

- physical sim city

- giant artificial microbe in a jar. 
  A-life for kids, preferably slimy as well as instuctional.

- stuffed animal that moves, etc, except all the electronics and
mechanical parts are made of soft, flexible materials (conducting thread,
artificial muscles). The main problem with all stuffed animals the "do
something" is that they are not snuggly.

- card with voice chip for passing secret messages, perhaps via IR

- sound splotlight for secret messages at a distance, like Star Trek

- fisher-price DNA sequencer

- diary connected to other kids' diaries from around the world.  You tell
it your troubles and it finds a diary entry from another kid with similar
concerns.

- animate your own drawings.  Kids draw on paper on top of a digitizing
tablet.  The image can then be animated by a computer and kids can add a
story to go with it.

- reconfigurable dress-up clothes.  Going beyond reversible jackets, with
these you could switch the arms of different shirts, change them from
puffy to tight, change the colour, change the style, using velcro, clever
design and use of fasteners, maybe dye that is sensitive to charge so it
changes colour when you expose it to current for a short time.
