Sorry I only sent 6 at first.  Here are the rest.

7. Temperature sensitive paint
A lot of toys have dyes that change color with temperature so you can touch
them and make them change color.  Kids should be able to paint with this
stuff.  Particularly their walls, so they can then finger paint the
temperature-sensitive regions.

8. Musical Jungle Gym
Kids build complex structures with bars and squares that play music when
touched.  Kids specify the musical relationships between the pieces.  They
can then run around on them to make music or set their cats free on them.

9. Remote control shark w/goggles
A remote control shark that can swim up down and around in the water.  It
has a digital video camera that broadcasts to a pair of glasses so the child
can see through the shark's eyes.

10. Cookie sculpture
Figure out a recipe for dough that you can sculpt into figures that don't
lose shape in the oven.  Kids can bake their sculptures to harden them and
then eat them.
