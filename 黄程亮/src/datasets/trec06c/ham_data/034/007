If you're trying to use the servo.c and servo.icb that came with the
Interactive C distribution, therein lies your problem.  I think those
routines are designed strictly for the MIT 6.270 controller board, not
for the HB (if I'm wrong about this, somebody please correct me).  For
instructions on how to run one or two servos from the HB, check out the
HB web site.  I tried it with my HB from Mr. Hui, and it worked great. 
Make sure you provide the correct voltage to the servos since the HB
voltage might fry 'em  ;-]
