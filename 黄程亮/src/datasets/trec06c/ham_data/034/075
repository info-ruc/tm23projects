a few notes...

in the faq there is a discussion about how to measure the resistance
of a motor coil, as a way of determining if it's compatible with the
hb.

also in the faq, is a description of a mod that will allow using a
separate power supply for the motors.

re: motor power, while the "fd()" and "bk()" functions apply full
power, the "motor()" function allows you to modulate the power level
between 0 and 100 percent.
