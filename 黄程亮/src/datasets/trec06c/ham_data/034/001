Make sure that your modulating the transmision part with the correct
frequency!  When I built my handy board I tested the IR TX circuit and it
gave me 57kHz instead of 40 kHz and I did use all the correct resistor
capacitor values.

I suggest that you check the output freq using a scope and make sure is
whithen tolerance!
