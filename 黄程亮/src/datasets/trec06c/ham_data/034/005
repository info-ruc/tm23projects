I'm not quite sure if this is what you are looking for, but if you need
to run motors that are not compatible with the HB's built-in H-bridge,
try one of the following:

(1) If you need up to twice the current, try piggybacking more motor
driver IC's on top of the HB's motor driver IC's.

(2) If you need different voltage, try severing the trace on the HB that
connects the HB battery and the HB motor power header, and plugging in a
separate motor battery pack.

(3) If you need a much heavier-duty motor driver, try building a
separate, external H-bridge or other type of motor drive circuit.  A
very simple, inexpensive one is described on the HB web site.  Best of
luck to you.
