There is a very high probability that you plugged the foil cable in
backwards.  Doing so, even for a moment, will destroy the IC chips.  It
will still click (I haven't figured that one out yet), but the IC chips and
possibly even the electrolytic capacitors, will need to be replaced before
you will get any reliable output.  

The only way I know to check to see if the cable is plugged in correctly or
not, is to use an ohm-meter and check continuity from the pin on the
interface plug to the IC chips.  Make sure to check continuity all the way
through, not just to the board.

The instructions for hooking up the foil cable is hard to find, and perhaps
non-existant, our team-mate had no idea what had happened.  It took
considerable time before we figured this one out, the clicking is very
deceptive.
