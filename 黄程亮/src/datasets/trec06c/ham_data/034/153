Subject: Interactive C Primitives
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

There are several IC primitives for which I cannot
find documentation nor source, such as:

poke, peek, pokeword, peekword, bit_set, bit_clear

These six are relatively simple to figure out by
context and familiarity with other languages, but
I find myself wondering what other primitives, and 
what nuances or caveats I may be missing.

Can someone point me to documentation/source for
IC primitives not documented in the HB Tech Reference,
lib_hb.c or lib_hb.asm ... or at least a list of
what primitives are available.  Or possibly point
out that these primitives are documented in plain 
sight and I'm just being dense.

All responses will be appreciated.
