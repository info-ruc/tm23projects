Subject: RE:stack pointer

hi fred and all,

i am facing a problem with the handyboard about the stack pointer. every
time i use a check on the digital and analog port on the console window, it
will give me a result of stack pointer off by 65... bytes. i would like to
know what is happening. and the HB will reset after sometime and when i
start the program again, it will still reset after sometime. is it the
problem with stack pointer or the voltage montior is faulty?

from,
michael
