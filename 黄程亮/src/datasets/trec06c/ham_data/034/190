Hello All,
Still a little confused about connecting the sonar unit. Can I simply=20
plug the polaroid connector to the sockets provided ,install the 1.5 wire
to digital 7 , install the cap at C7? or do I have to have the diodes and
connect to the motor port??
					Thanks=20

<The Expansion Board implements the same Polaroid 6500 driver circuit as
previously published. To connect the 6500 board into the Expansion Board,
perform the following steps:>



<1.Install the 9-pin flex cable adapter in the position provided. 2.Solde=
r
a 1.5" length of solid core hookup wire (22 gauge) to the PCB pad labeled
J12, thread it between the digital output and analog input headers, and
plug it into digital input 7 on the main Handy Board. 3.Use the sonar.c
driver provided on the Handy Board sonar web page,>
