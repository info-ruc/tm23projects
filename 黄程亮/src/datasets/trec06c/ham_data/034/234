No particular order:

1) Robot Star Wars Figures
   Figures that can be controlled via a "board" of some type.  Can program 
   what you want groups of people to do and sit back and watch it unfold.
   For example, say you have ten storm troopers you want to chase Boba Fett 
   cause he just sold out to a higher bidder and is escaping with secret 
   Imperial plans.  Well, one person does not have eleven hands.  With this,
   that problem would be solved.  Or, you could find 6 friends to play with, but
   this is a bit harder.

2) Musical Clothes
   Original idea was a musical shoe.  Clothing contains a sensors or something
   that will create music as you play, walk, exercise, what have you.  But this 
   is stored in some chip that you can take out when you get home or to the
   office or . . ., plug into the computer device, and hear what music you
   created while playing outside etc.

3) Virtual Zoo
   Web based thing.  Create and name your own zoo, only instead of cages, people
   go to the "actual" habitats to see the zoo specimens.  Amount of detail will
   range from general for the small tykes to very specific for the control
   freaks.  As you form your zoo, get to learn about the animals, endangered 
   species, habitats, etc.  This will also keep track of how many people both
   visit your sight and which attractions they visit.  Can team up with other
   kids and create a mega zoo over the web. . .  Also will be able to design your
   own species, either here on earth or on far away planets.  As long as you can
   keep up the illusion . . .

4) Musical picture
   Draw a cartoon, shapes, what have you and can add sounds to your work.  ZOINK!

5) Fun with fluids
   See through pipes so you can wathc as fluids coarse through, kind of a take 
   off of the electric train.  Could also be used to mimic the human vascular 
   system or the like.

6) Incredible Journey
   Just like the movie, only now a game (ok, copyright issues here, but . . .)
   Learn about the human body, medicine, diseases.  Could have a goal like take
   on the AIDS virus with your super sub or something like that.

7) Circuit Maze
   Travel through the world of an IC chip.  Could also have people design their 
   own chip of sorts, and see how the electron travels through it.  Start off by
   including some of the most widely used IC chips, like computer memory,
   microporcessors, car air conditioning controlers, . . .

8) Wanna be rappers
   Can create a personalized rap group.  Have programmed in some poetry that 
   works well to a definate beat and sounds "cool."  This "box" will interact
   with the user as they slow down or speed up, or could be set to keep an
   unyielding beat.     

9) Model airplane and a computer
   Put a chip into a model airplane.  Have the chip talk to a computer thing and 
   allow the child to fly the plane and watch it fly on the computer.  Can see
   how the temperature changes (if any), wind patterns, drop bombs.  Could also
   be a glider and the computer will track its speed.  Or computer could draw 
   things depending on how/where the plane flies.

10) Tub time boats
    Interactive toy boats.  They dodge as you spray water at them, and they
    shoot back.  Could also become submersible to avoid the common capsizing.
