For the Web-page Classification problem, we consider the following
existing methods on data extraction from unstructured documents:


A.  Automatic Term Extraction and Weighting:


  a) Term Frequency (TF): TF = Number of occurrence of term k in a
                                document m;
        W(d,t) = TF(d,t), where W(d,t) = the weight of a term t in a
                                         document t


        Note that TF is known to improve the recall in IR.



  b) Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): IDF is proportional to 1/[df(t)]
        which determines the importance of each term that is inversely
        proportional to the number of documents that contain the term t.
        IDF measures term occurrence across a collection of documents.


        Note that TF(d,t) and IDF(t) would contribute to improve the recall
                and the precision respectively.



  c) Weighted Inverse Document Frequency (WIDF): WIDF corresponds to the
        normalized term frequency over the collection. WIDF differs in
        each document.



B. IR Models:


   1) Vector Space Model: A document or a query can be represented as a
        vector, with each term as a t-dimensional axis and a document or 
        query resides in t-dimensional space.  The magnitude of a document
        or query results from the computation of associated terms.


        i.e., d1 = (t1, t2, . , tn); ..., q1 = (u1, u2, ., uk);
                where d1 = document 1;
                      q1 = query 1;
                      t1 = number of occurrence (or weight) of term1 in a d1; 



   2) Probabilistic Model: The probability of term j occurring in a 
        document, given document is (NOT) relevant to a given query.



   3) Clustering Model: This model is based on clusters of similar documents
        into a class, called "Centroid", and a "Super-centroid" can be
        formed from many similar centroid. Using the similarity measure
        between two centroid or super-centroid, weight of a centroid term
        is computed as the average of the weights for that term over all
        documents in a cluster.
