Hi:

I know the essential facts about IC's multitasking facilites and how to
implement processes.  But if you have too many processes is it normal for
the board to reset?  If so, how can it be prevented.

Also how do I figure out for how many ticks to run each process.

PS. This might be a dumb questions to all in the list, but please bear
with me cuz I am fairly new to this list.
Any help will be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.
