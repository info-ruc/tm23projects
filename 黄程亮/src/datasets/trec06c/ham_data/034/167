Dear Friends,
	We have put ICs 6811,74374,74244,62256LP,74132,74138 on the handy
board.The charger interfacer board is completely ready.All resistors,
capacitors have been completely connected.LCD is not connected.
	When we try to download the pcode, it downloads perfectly well.
However,when we boot IC it gives some errors. In a few cases,the beeper
beeps continuously and IC does not boot. In certain cases the beeper
beeps only once on reset and after that IC boots properly. When We
entered 1 + 2;
We got the answer as 3 properly. However when We do 123 * 2; We get 
different answers at different times. All answers We get are multiples of
123 like 123, 246 ,492.
	In a few cases the beeper does not beep at all on reset and IC
does not boot. I believe that there is a short somewhere which is causing 
problems. Can any one please tell me where the problem can possibly be?
							Yours sincerely,
							     Nitin
