I guess I have a really simple question to ask...  I know that I can 
share many of the lines off of the SPI in order to hook up two polaroid 
sensors...  However, is it really necessary to add a diode to each of the 
ECHO lines?  If so, what are the specs for those diodes?  I am basing the 
fact that I can use D3 for the additional INIT line for the second 
sonar.  IS THIS CORRECT?  I would not like to just chuck and jive with 
this, it is of course university property.  I would like the reply to go 
to my account directly cause I don't know when Fred will get me added to 
the mailing list...  Thanks


Ian
