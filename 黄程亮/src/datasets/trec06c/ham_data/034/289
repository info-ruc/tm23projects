1) Tagged baseball cards - Tags index cards into a giant database of
constantly updated statistics.  Cards can retrieve simple statistics,
or current news stories.  Combinations can bring up past head-to-head
match ups or teams that two players have played together on.

2) Not-dumb water rocket - The good old pump-em-up water rocket with
internal ballast that it can adjust to ensure that the projectile
returns in a relatively tight proximity to where it was launched from.
That way, it wouldn't end up on the neighbor's roof.  Could also be
outfitted with a camera, altimeter, or other sensors to record the
flight.

3) Microsoft Barney Plays Devil's Advocate - Some kind of TV
watch-along partner to keep kids interested in current events.  Needs
a television show produced in conjunction.  Can help point out the
simple conflicts between the two (or more) sides to complex issues.
Warning:  Many parents may just plain hate this toy.

4) Ball that keeps score - knows when it goes through a goal, hoop,
or other scoring device.  Keeps score.  Would be difficult to make
it call fouls, but that could be the magic.

5) Above Average Card Table - Uses real cards, but keeps track of them.
Can teach kids how to play new games, or be an automated playing
partner.

6) Instrument with teach mode - Display shows music, keys/drum heads/
valves lite up in conjunction with notes.  As the player gets more
advanced, can set to only turn on key lights when a mistake is made.
If designed well, should teach not only to play, but also to read
music.  Should come up with a good way to teach improv.

7) Animated Book - Make the pictures move to keep the new no-
attention-span kids interested in reading.

8) Stuffed animal alarm clock thing - knows a kid's schedule to remind
them when they have to start getting ready, leave for school, etc.
Networked so parents can update schedule on line, or use it to page
kids.  Some professors could use this.  PDA in a pound puppy.

9) Either a cardboard box that repairs itself, or a cardboard
subscription.  Each deivery comes with a new design.

10) Fireworks - LCDs make non-burning sparks.
