Subject: where do you buy a 68hc11?

Hello all,

I'm in the purchasing phase of my handy board project.  I understand 
that Digi-Key and Mouser do not sell 68HC11 microcontrollers.  I tried 
Newark, and they want me to buy 23 at a time(!)

Where have you been buying your 68HC11's?  (I may be asking this 
question prematurely since I haven't checked with Motorola yet.  So, 
please forgive me.)  Also, what price have you been getting for them?

Thank-you for your input.

Steve Owens
