  I would like to know if there are any Canadians on the list to talk 
about parts acquisitions.  It seems that my local radio shack is 
quite useless for this kind of project I would just use the parts 
list but I am saving it as a last resort as you see our Canadian 
dollar is somewhat lacking so to order required parts is quite 
expensive.  So if any one can help help with a list of alternate 
suppliers I would be grateful.

Thanx
