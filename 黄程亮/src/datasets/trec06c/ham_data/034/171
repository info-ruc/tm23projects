these are documented in sec 5.10 of the hb tech ref.

the larger issue is knowing the places you are supposed to peek and
poke.  some of these are hardware specific (e.g, motor port); others
are software based/defined in the pcode implementation (e.g., system
time).

these are largely undocumented (esp the software ones) b/c they're not
an interface we wanted to expose to the user.
