Greetings all!
        I just finished building the handyboard from a kit, and it seems
to be working just fine except for the fact that I can't seem to get the
config register to set to 0x0c.  It is now working on the 0x0d setting,
but I know this is incorrect from an email I saw in the archives.
Whenever I try to use the 0x0c setting, I can't download anything to the
board, but I can when I use the 0x0d setting. I'm using the Windows 95
downloader and the kit I bought from Partrick Hui Robot Store in Hong
Kong.  I'd just like to know how I can change the register to 0x0c.
Thank you.
