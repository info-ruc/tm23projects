Subject: Memory erase or reset?
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hello,

I have been loading an alternative runtime environment (not IC)
onto the handy board to test it out, and I want to ensure that 
all of the RAM is erased before doing so. I can use the unload
command in IC to delete all of the .c files, but how do I get
ride of the IC runtime? Is there a command to erase the RAM,
or is there some kind of reset function?

TIA,
Doug
