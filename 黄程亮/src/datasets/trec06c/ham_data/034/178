Look at these:
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/software/sonar.html
    and 
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbexp30/software.html

I also added a 100uF cap across the supply as shown in this link:
http://www.robotics.com/arobot/sonar.html
Others suggest ana even larger cap. (470uF), but I haven't had any
problems with power sag until the batteries are almost discharged.
