Why would you want to? They would be as expensive to build than to
buy.  The Dinsmore device is only $12, and PNI Vector2X is $49.
(retail, probably cheaper somewhere).

The Dinsmore device has a compass mechanism (real basic, like you take
camping), and when the N arrow points to a hall effect device it is
triggered. You could probably build a dinsmore like device using a
larger camping compass, and have a bunch of hall effect devides glued
to the sides.
