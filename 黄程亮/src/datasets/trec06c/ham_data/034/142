Subject: IR Proximity Detector using a pic
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi,

I found this very easy and cheap to build IR Proximity Detector.
It uses one PIC12C508 or 509.
I post this on the mailing list, because i searched some days until i
found it, and maybe there are people, who are searching the
same :)
For those who are interested, look at: http://www.dprg.org/irprox.html

Mail me if you need a URL of a cheap (only $2 !) programmer for Pic's
(16C84,24Cxx,12c50x).

Bye, Simon
