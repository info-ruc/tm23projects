Windows tips:

	Tip 1: Lose Windows!!! Reboot your computer, hit "F8" when the
little message "Starting Windows 95" comes up. Select the option "Command
prompt only". Now, run IC and/or DL and you should have no problems.
Basically, windows is nothing but a parasite of DOS and is coming between
you, the user, the program and the port you are communicating to the HB
though.
