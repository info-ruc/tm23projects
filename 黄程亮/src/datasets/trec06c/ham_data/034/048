To anyone who can help:

I too have contructed the HB expansion board.  All i/o
ports appear to work.  The servo controllers appear to
work well also.  However, like Ranjit, I'm having Polaroid
Sonar problems.  I got this as a kit from Wirtz Electronics.
When activated, it appears to function (it repeatedly clicks
when "sonar_display()" is executed), but returns apparently
random readings.

Does anyone have any suggestions as to what might be wrong?
