Hi,

I found this on the internet, and I wanted to know if anyone
is using it:

http://dinsmoregroup.com/dico/1490spec.htm

They produce a digital Compass which is very cheap ($12  only).
Anyone already used such a compass ?
Is there a way to get such a compass working with
the HandyBoard ?


Thanks in advance!

Bye, Simon
