All,

Here's our agenda on Tuesday, and a reminder of our assignment:

  (1) toy technologies (45min):
      What technology ingredients (things, tools, people, processes)
      are available, both in the Lab and beyond?

  (2) top ten toy ideas (45min):
      Your best ten (our best ~250) ideas for wonderful new toys.

  (3) Ivy Ross, head of Mattel's Barbie design group (30min):
      Barbie is the most popular toy in the world by many measures,
      and Mattel's latest designs run the gamut from "Talk To Me Barbie"
      (featuring speech and infrared PC links), and the Barbie camera,
      to the Ultimate "Phantom of the Opera" Barbie, which includes
      a first class ticket to London to see the show.

Both 1 & 2 will be ongoing for us throughout the term.  Think of
our job as constructing a yellow pages of toyable technologies,
and a kind of "joy of cooking" of toy ideas.  We'll all uncover
many more ideas to add as we go, but the idea of this class is
think broadly -- we will dig deeper into focused issues later.
To that end, prior to class on Tuesday, can you each please
send *one* email to the whole class (play99@media.mit.edu)
with your top ten toy ideas.  Please put your best creative
thought into this -- we're going to brainstorm on these ideas
on Tuesday, and refreshing new concepts would be a great beginning.

Let me suggest we keep our email simple, e.g.:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
10. Olympic Rings.
    It's a new kind of LEGO jewelry -- five colored bangles that
    snap together to make a bracelet; or, snap them into the shape
    of the Olympic logo.  Internally illuminated with colored LED's,
    with PIC control and metal connectors.  Animated color effects
    when bracelets are assembled.

9. LEGO Toothbrush.
    Assemble your own electric toothbrush out of LEGO toys.
    Toothbrush plays music, or the headlines of today's current events,
    or reminders ("it's 8:15 am! 97 days til your next dentist visit!") --
    when the entertainment stops, brushing time is over.  Has inductive
    link for power/data; snaps into charger base.

8. Etch-A-Sketch Wizard.
    An Etch-a-Sketch transformed into a PostScript printer.
    Easel holds the tablet, and contains XY steppers to twiddle the
    knobs, and a shaker to erase.  USB interface and some image software
    for driver to allow you to convert snapshots of your friends
    into Etch-A-Sketch cartoons.  (Idea first proposed by Lau & Kaye).
    . . .
-----------------------------------------------------------------

As a reminder, 2/23 is focused on learning with construction toys,
and 3/2 will be about expressive toys.  Tod, Mitch and I will rotate
turns as nominal leader.

See you Tuesday,

Mike, Tod, and Mitch
