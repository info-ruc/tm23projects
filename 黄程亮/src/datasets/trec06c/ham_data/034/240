1.      MUSICAL PUZZLE
Musical blocks that you put together to compose a song.  Each block contains=
 a
musical phrase and a landscape representing the pitch contour and length of=
 the
notes.  As you put the blocks together they each play their respective=
 musical
phrases.  The object is to put the puzzle together in the correct order, or=
 to
create your own music with the existing pieces.

2.      MUSICAL N-PUZZLE
Each square contains a musical phrase or representation of a phrase, and as=
 you
snap the squares together they play.  In some ways, it's the same as the
musical puzzle except that it's a pocket sized version.

3.      MUSCIAL COLORING/DRAWING PENS
Pens play sounds depending on what you draw.  For example, the harder you=
 press
the louder the sound gets.  Or if you draw in an upwards motion, the pitch
increases, etc.  Different colored pens could make different kinds of=
 sounds.

4.      DIGITAL DIARY/JOURNAL/SCRAPBOOK
Basically, it=92s a digital book.  Young girls can write or record diary or
journal entries.  They can annotate their entries with art, audio, video,
photographs, etc=85

5.      PROGRAMMABLE DOLLS
Like programmable bricks, but geared more for young girls.  Allow girls to
program behaviors for their dolls.  For example, if a baby doll doesn't get=
 fed
for a certain number of hours, make it start crying.  Sort of a
"do-it-yourself" Tamagotchi.

6.      DRESS UP
Use a vision/object recognition system to return relevant video, images,
information about the time periods in which the children are pretending to
dress up.

7.      CHILDREN'S VIDEO CAMERA
Simpler version of a normal video camera, but with built-in editing
capabilities and "fun" functions (i.e. special effects filters, character
filters, etc=85)  Should also be digital so that kids can download their=
 movies
and send them to friends. =20

8. REMOTE CONTROL CAR WITH CAMERA
So that you don't have to look at where the car is from a distance, but=
 instead
you see on a screen the driver's perspective.  Can also link with other car
owners to exchange features.  For example, one guy has turbo boost for extra
performance and yours has variable suspension, and you infrared each other=
 to
gain features.  The features are already built in, but the "infrared=
 exchange"
unlocks them.

9. LOW TECH COMIC BOOK =20
Comes with pre-drawn backgrounds.  You use magnetic characters and objects=
 to
build little scenes.  Also things like blank cutouts where you can write=
 your
own dialog.

10. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION PEN
A little electronic pen for wannabe engineers that will tell you the
composition of anything you touch it to.
