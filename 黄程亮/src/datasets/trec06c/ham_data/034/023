I am almost complete with construction of my first handyboard. I used an in
accurate list to order my components and have a 2.94K resistor instead of
3.83K as per the other list I have and the assembly manual.  My question
is; Is the resistor only used for the IR circuit and if so I can run
without it, correct? I want to wait until I need something else before I
order just a couple of resistors. any help is appreciated!
