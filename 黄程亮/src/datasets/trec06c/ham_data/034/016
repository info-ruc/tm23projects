Subject: HB bootstrap problem when U6 installed
Date: Wed, 03 Feb 1999 22:01:32 -0500
From: "Fred G. Martin" <fredm@media.mit.edu>
X-Mts: smtp

i am guessing that some of the inputs to u6 are defective, causing it
to assert its outputs when it shouldn't.  this could turn on the '244
input latch, driving the bus when it should not.

please check that pins 1 through 6 signals are oscillating (with the
chip removed and installed).  with the chip installed, check that pins
7 and 9 are not pulsing--- should be high.
