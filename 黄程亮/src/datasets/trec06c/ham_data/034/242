1. Musical glowsticks
Glowsticks are a lot of fun to wave around in the dark to make cool trails
(as many electronic music fans can attest).  It would be really cool if
moving the glowsticks created sound in addition to responding to it.  This
could work via piesoelectric sensors sending radio signals to a sound
synthesizer or computer.  It could also work by making them whistle or
resonate in a more analog fashion.

2. Digital Recorder trigger kit
This would be a digital sound recorder, a speaker, and a kit of triggers and
cables for kids to set up gags of various sorts.  Triggers could include
motion detectors (to work as alarms), piesoelectric sensors (digital whoopee
cushion), timers, IR remote control, sound sensor (telling people to
"Ssshhh"), light sensor, etc.  Could include prerecorded sounds from action
movies, funny sound effects, and a cable to record sounds downloaded from
the net.  The kit could also include ways to disguise the gear as coffee
mugs, picture frames, etc.

3. Robot "Director"
Essentially a simplified computer interface to a group of robotic toys with
speech synthesis and motion capabilities.  Children could write scripts for
robots to act out (even adapting plays and screenplays they read in school)
and watch as they walk around and speak to each other.  There could also be
a web site with scripts of famous scenes in theater and film, allowing kids
to watch them played out on the living room floor.

4. Musical beads
Each bead plays a single note.  When connected in a string they play a
melody which is looped when the beads form a necklace or bracelet.  The
beads could also be motion sensitive so that aspects of the sound (tone,
resonance, distortion) alter with movement so dancing could create
Roland-303-like "acid line" effects.

5. Furniture/Fort construction kit
When the kid gets it, it looks like a couch.  It is built, however, entirely
out of interlocking foam, wood, and pillows that is easily broken down and
rebuilt into new pieces of furniture and forts.  A child's entire room
(dressers, bed, couches, chairs, desk) could be disassembled and reassembled
as the child saw fit.  The big problem with forts is they always broke down
because the pieces didn't lock together.  In the kit, all the pieces could
have puzzle-like edges to keep them together.

6. Storybook elaboration kit
A line of storybooks that come with accessories for clay modelling that
allow kids to build action figures of the characters in the book.  Basic kit
comes with colored modelling clay and simple accessories; each storybook
comes with new outfits/accessories.  Children read the book and then can
enact scenes from the book and make characters from multiple stories
interact.  There could also be a digital version of this which allows kids
to design animated sequences with the characters of multimedia stories on
the computer.  The animation sprites could be translated between book
modules to allow cross-fertilization of stories.  Kids could then print out
scripts or translate them into prose.  Hybrid or novel animated characters
could also be built and traded with other kids over the net.
