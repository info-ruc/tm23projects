It's possible that the flat flex cable could make electrical contact
either way, since the socket has "teeth" in it that could penetrate the
insulation on the one side of the cable.

And *don't* trust that the dotted edge is the correct one; I ordered the
pair of sonar kits, and it came with one cable correctly marked and the
other cable incorrectly marked.

Just make sure that pin 1 as marked on the sonar module board ends up
connected to the corresponding pin on the expansion board.  If you're in
any doubt, check the circuits and verify that V+ goes to V+, GND goes to
GND, etc.  I hope this helps.
