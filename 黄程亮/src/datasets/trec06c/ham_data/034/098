  I am Mr. lawrence Edge, a solicitor at law. I
am the personal attorney to late Mr. Pitt Sadiq,
who used to work with Pan African Coporation in
Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to as my
client. 
  On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and
their only daughter were involved in a car accident
along sagbama express road.
  All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost
there lives. Since then I have made several
enquiries to your embassy here to locate any of my
clients extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful 
attempts,I decided to track his last name over the
Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I
contacted you.
  I have contacted you to assist in repartrating the
fund valued at US$3.5million left behind by my
client before it gets confisicated or declared
unserviceable by the holding bank where this huge amount were deposited. The said BANK has issued me a notice to provide the next 
of kin or have the account confisicated within the
next fourteen official working days. For the fact
that I have been unsuccesfull in locating the
relatives for over 2 years now, I seek the consent
to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, 
since you have the same last name with my client, so
that the proceeds of this account can be paid to
you. 
  Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities
for transfer.I have all necessary information and
legal rights needed to back you up for claim. All I
require from you is your honest cooperation to
enable us see this transaction through.
  I guarantee that this will be executed under
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from
any breach of the law.Please get in touch with me
through this email address.
  Best regards,
Lawrence edge
