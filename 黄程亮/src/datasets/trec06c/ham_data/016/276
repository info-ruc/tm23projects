Subject: Does the HB NEED 9.6 volts?

I am planning on using stepper motors with a handy board, which hopefully=
 I will have in a week :)
The specs on the HB say it uses 9.6 volts. Is this a required voltage? or=
 can it be another rating as long as it is within the regulators limits. =
Basically I want to use 12 volt motors, but not at 9.6 volts. I am assumi=
ng if I use 12 volts the regulator will still supply 5 volts to the circu=
it, correct?

Also, does anyone know what the minimum voltage which can be supplied is?
