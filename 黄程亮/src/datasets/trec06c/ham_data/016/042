Subject: Cannot download pcode on a Mac G3

Hello everyone,
	I've been having a problem downloading pcode to a handyboard or
rugwarrior board from my Mac G3 (266 Mhz desktop model).  When I try to
download the bootstrap code, it reports that the bootstrap failed after
000 bytes, etc.. etc...   The funny thing is that I am able to
communicate with either the rug warrior or handyboard just fine as long
as they both have working pcode installed in them already.  I am using IC
version 3.1 and have found this behavior to be the same for both the
modem and the printer port.
	I have also found that when I try to change the definitions file
in the preferences menu to download different pcode and libraries to the
handyboard or rug warrior, IC crashes usually during the second
configuration swap.

	I thought that I'd try using IC 2.852 to see if I would get
better behavior.  Here's a transcript of the failed download:

Please place board in download mode and press RETURN
To quit, press Q
For help, press H
Downloading 256 byte bootstrap (229 data)

Timeout on serial receive.  256 chars left to receive
Perhaps the board was not connected properly or not in download mode

Please place board in download mode and press RETURN
To quit, press Q
For help, press H


	Has anybody else had similar problems?  Randy or Fred, any ideas
as to why IC doesn't like my Mac G3?  I'm running system 8.1, BTW.  

-Paul.
