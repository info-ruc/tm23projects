So, this still doesn't help me figure out how to address the LCD.  It 
has A8 and A9 connected along with a CLK from Port A.

Does this mean that the LCD is NOT memory mapped?  Do I first have to 
write to Port B then write to Port A, to clock it.  This must mean 
that I have to go into and out of expanded mode to use both the LCD 
and the SRAM?  That's kinda wierd.

Anything else you can point me to as far as addressing the LCD and 
accessing SRAM via assembly code?
