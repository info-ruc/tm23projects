I have those docs.  I knew that it was driven by the hd44780 but the 
summary page on their web site indicated that the 44780 could drive 2 
lines of 8 characters and I assumed there must be a micro on the 
board to handle the 2x16 and that there might be some other command 
set other than the 44780.

Anyway I now have the docs.

thanks,
