> that print will only come from the driver if debugging is on (is it?).

I think you are looking at a not-yet-released version of the driver.
In the most recent update of devata.c on plan9.bell-labs.com, the
Creqsense message is printed even when debugging is off, and is followed
by an error(Eio).

But you are right that the real problem is probably the 2GB disk
limitation in devata.c.  I think b.com is actually all right up to 4GB.
