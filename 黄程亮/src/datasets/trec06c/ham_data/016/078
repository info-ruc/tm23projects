From the driver code I recently sent out:
 * LCD Connections on the Handyboard
 *	PORTB bit 0 - R/W
 *	PORTB bit 1 - RS (Register Select, 0 = instruction)
 *	PORTC 8 bits of Data
 *	PORTA bit 4 - E clock

That is correct, the LCD is NOT memory mapped, it is connected
directly to the pins on the 68HC11 that become ports A, B, and C
in "single chip" mode.

That is correct.
Something like:
	Write B
	Write C (this is your data)
	Write the clock high
	NOP
	Write the clock low
(The NOP is to insure the timing requirements of the LCD are met,
you can leave it out but it can screw up when the LCD is cold)

Not exactly, it means the SRAM is unavailable to you when you are
in single chip mode, however there is at least 256 bytes of RAM
addressed at address 0 that is available (its inside the
processor). It's not "kinda" weird, it is very, very weird.

Other than the source I sent out? Not really. Note that you can't
address SRAM easily in single chip mode. I suspect it is possible
but it is much easier to copy stuff from SRAM into the first 256
bytes before you switch into single chip mode.
