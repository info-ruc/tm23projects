Subject: how do I build my own pcode?
X-Priority: 3 (Normal)
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Title says it really.

I am using both IC2.8something and IC3.2. I would like to make some
small changes to the pcode for these to allow other LCDs and so on.
(one goal would be to do without the LCD if I wanted to)

I would rather work in a DOS/Windows environment but could use linux if
I had to.

Can anyone tell me exactly what I need to have and what I need to do to
build my own pcode for the board.

Many thanks

pete
