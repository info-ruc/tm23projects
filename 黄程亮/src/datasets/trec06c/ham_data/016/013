Subject: Re: Testing with PCBUG11 - Getting Close
Priority: normal
In-Reply-To: <199805030045.RAA21129@smtp4.nwnexus.com>

My problem turned out to be with Win 95.  If I boot to DOS the 
PCBUG11 program works fine.  It fails to work when working from a DOS 
window.

I can now communicate with the MCU so my RS232 must be fine.  When 
working from the command line in PCBUG, I cannot access the SRAM.  
A15 never changes from LOW.

It is as though I cannot access anything except the internal MCU 
locations.  I can read/write EEPROM ok.

1) Is it possible to access external SRAM from PCBUG?
2) Shouldn't  one be able to control the port data from PCBUG?  I've 
tried but get BAD ADDRESS (or BAD MEMORY something like that).  Like 
it's not there
3) Still would like to know baud rate in boot mode?
4) Is the LCD manual on the web somewhere?  Maybe I'll play with that 
tomorrow.

Looks like I'll have fun tomorrow playing with this.
