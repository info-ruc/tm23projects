Subject: Re: dc motor blues 

Hi All;

        Along the same lines, I would LOVE to control my motors so they run
at constant speed under varying load.  I know that it's theoretically
possible to sense the RPM of a PM DC motor by tracking the drive voltage as
the commutator makes and breaks.  Has anyone tried using this as feedback in
a PWM control loop?  I'm guessing that the PWM frequency would have to be at
least an order of magnitude greater than the motor RPM.  Or would it just be
easier to use an encoder?
