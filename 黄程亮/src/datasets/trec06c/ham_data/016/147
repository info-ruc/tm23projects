I use the Siemens SFH506-36 instead of the Sharp, and it works just fine. I
know there also is another compenent you can use, but I don't know the name
of it anymore, sorry. Perhaps if Maarten Emke reads this, he knows what I
mean.
Be carefull by the way, the pin lay-out is different:

Sharp IS1U60
1: out
2: gnd
3: vcc

Siemens SFH506-36
1: gnd
2: vcc
3: out

Thanks to Maarten Emke again for this info.

Hope this helps,
