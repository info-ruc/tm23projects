You can pick up the pcode source from the MIT web site at 
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/pcode_p
c.zip

This file contains the source code for 2.8 pcode with instructions on how
to re-compile under msd*s.

I have modified the source to use larger/smaller LCD displays,  although
they need to be ones that use the Hitachi HD44780 chipset.  

IC 3.x source code is available from ftp://newtonlabs.com/contrib/  
This is the version that has the new smooth-pwm motor drivers. 

The Un*x version of the source is also available somewhere in
ftp://cherupakha.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/6270/interactive-c
