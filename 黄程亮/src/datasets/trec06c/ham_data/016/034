Hello,

Lately I am having problems communicating with the handyboard after it
is reset.  
I can download the pcode_hb.s19 file using hbdl.exe downloader.

When the Handyboard is reset by toggling the power switch, the following
is observed.

1st symptom : No welcome message on screen

Running ic.exe after the reset causes something to be written to the
port as indicated by the RS-232 minitester, but nothing is returned from
the Handyboard side.

2nd symptom: <Following log>
	Attempting to link to board on port com2
	Synchronizing with board
	Board disconnected or not responding, retrying
	<infinite loop of above statement>

I have checked the Memory Power and it appears to be constant at 5.5V.
I have not checked it with an oscilloscope to see if there are any
spikes in the memory power.

I would appreciate comments in solving this problem.

Thank you,

Tejesh
