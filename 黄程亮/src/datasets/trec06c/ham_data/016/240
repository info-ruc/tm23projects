Hi

I built a small circular robot base with differential steering using 3" =
diameter rubber wheels and optical encoders on both wheels.
The motors powering the robot are high efficiency German built gear =
motors using 300 mA when stalled, and rotating @ 60 RPM unloaded.
The encoders are home built reflective type producing 16 pulses/rev.
The robot is controlled by the Handy board using the smooth PWM Pcode.  =
The motors are powered by a 12V 3 Ah gel cell battery.

The problem is that one of the motors is 2 RPM slower than the other =
therefore the robot tends to drift toward the side of the slower motor.
I have a few ideas on how to accomplish this, but two heads are better =
than one, so I'm looking for some input to help me write an efficient =
program to keep the robot moving straight.
=20
Any Ideas are welcome.

Thanks=20

Laszlo Roska.
