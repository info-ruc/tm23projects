you should charge a lead acid battery which is between 10% and 90% charged
at a rate of Capacity/10. In this case the rate would be 0.2 amps.  when
the battery is either almost charged (>90% charged) or almost depleted
(<10% charged) the rate shoud be Capacity/20 because the internal
resistance of the cells makes the battery less efficient at these times. 
(paraphrased from "The Complete Battery Book", by Richard A. Perez, p26.)
