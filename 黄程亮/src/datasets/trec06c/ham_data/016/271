Hi everyone.
I use a 4 bits binary counter to measure the no. of pulses emitted from
a shaft encoder(TTL output) in order to calulate the speed of a DC
motor. But i want to know what is the best frequency that the processor
should take the bit pattern from the counter?
what does it depends on?

Thank you for all your help.
