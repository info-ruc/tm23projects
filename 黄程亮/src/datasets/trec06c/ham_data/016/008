Subject: Testing with PCBUG11
Priority: normal

I have assembled the HandyBoard up to the point of adding the SRAM.  
I am still waiting for my SRAM to arrive.  But, I want to check out 
as much as possible.  

Every step checked out fine to this point.

I have two options at this point.  I have an 6264 (8K x 8) that will 
give me 8K for not (not using IC yet).  I also have an 811E2 in the 
board for now.

I tired to run PCBUG, to test the communications with the MCU but I 
get the following error each time I try to communicate with the 
board:

Fatal Error[9] - Hardware communication failure.  PCBug terminated.

This error makes me wonder if something might be wrong with my RS232.

Questions:
1) What should the baud rate be during boot sequence?  
2) Does PCBug set it automatically?  
3) Do I have to set it from Win95 before running PCBug?
4) Does anyone have any suggestions how to test the RS232 using 
PCBug11?
