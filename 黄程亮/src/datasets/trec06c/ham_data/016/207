The air compressor (the one meant to be driven by a motor) is offered in the
Lego Shop At Home Spring '98 catalog as part #5117, $4.00, and it comes with
a few pulley wheels.  Often, even if they don't mention it in their current
catalog, if you have the part number they can get it for you.  If you're
looking for the hand operated air pump instead, that one is part #5107, $3.25.

Another source for Lego Technics is the Pitsco Dacta catalog.  You can call
them at 1-800-362-4308.  Be sure to compare prices, though, because
sometimes there are huge differences in price between the two companies.
