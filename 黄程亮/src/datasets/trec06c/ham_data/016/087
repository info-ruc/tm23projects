Subject: Re: Cannot download pcode on a Mac G3

I have a 266 G3 minitower, and I have the identical problem.  The only way
to solve this is to let IC die, not reset the HB and then run IC again.  It
complains to can't talk to the HB, and then I reset the HB and all works
fine.  Kinda odd, but it works.
