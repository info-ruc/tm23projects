Please forgive this probably silly question; as a software person I only dabble
in hardware as a hobby:

I want to make my own little expansion board and it requires signals from the
expansion connectors of the HandyBoard.  In particular I want to run a ribbon
cable out of the HB from the same header that the LCD plugs in to (GND thru D7).

How can I do this and still have my LCD work?  Is there some kind of header
available that will 'fork' the connection 2 ways?

Thanks,
/Max
