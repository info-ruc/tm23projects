I used the MC34064 in both of the handyboards that I built.

WARNING !! The pin out the DS1233 and MC34064 is DIFFERENT! You need to
rotate the MC34064 by 120 degrees. Check the pin out before inserting
the MC34064. If you do not rotate it, the Handyboard will not work
correctly and the 34064 will get very hot. When I built my boards I
inserted the 34064 directly into the DS1233 holes. It took me 3 days to
find the problem.
