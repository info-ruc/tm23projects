Subject: Controlling a DC motor 2
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi again,  I think i should change my previous question to the
following.

Is there any alternatives to control a DC motor motion (speed, direction
etc) without using a motor driver?
how? please explain briefly.

Thank you for your replies.
