I got mine from FutureActive. I don't remember what the cost was and I
don't remember what else I got from them, but it was more than just that. I
think I placed about 2 orders with them. I would much rather deal with
Mouser and Digikey. If you have at least $50 worth of parts to get, I would
suggest trying Allied. They seem to have everything and at great prices
compared to others, but they want you to spend at least $50. I don't
remember why I did not like ordering from FutureActive, but there was a
reason.
