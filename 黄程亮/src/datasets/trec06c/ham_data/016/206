Is it possible to buy individual legos that are not normally sold
individually? For exaple, the pneumatic parts are advertised as being sold
seperately. But several sets have an air compression chamber that is not
advertized as being available to be individually sold. Is there any way I
can order just one of these, short of buying the whole set that contains the
compression chamber?

thanks
