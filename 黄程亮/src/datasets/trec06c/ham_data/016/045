on the interface/charger, since there's a bridge rectifier immediately
normalizing the input jack voltage -- regardless of polarity -- it
kind of doesn't matter which polarity you use.

there is a discrepancy between the int/charger schematic and PCB.  the
schematic shows the input voltage going to pins 2 and 3 of the bridge,
but on the PCB the input goes to pins 1 and 2.

i'm actually not sure of the internal wiring of the db-101 bridge, so
i can't say whether the schematic is drawn correctly (neglecting the
pin number issue and treating the bridge as a collection of 4 diodes).

i should figure out what the right answer is and revise the schematic.
as a matter of consistency, i assume the center pin negative wiring
when i create a new design (would be bad to have two different kinds
of adapters floating around the lab).  so the schematic for the
int/charger breaks this "fred standard adapter" rule.  probably, when
i laid out the int/charger board, i knew i was using an integrated
bridge DIP, and i didn't bother to follow my rule because i knew it
wouldn't matter from a practical standpoint.

i still might have gotten the PCB "right" though - it depends on the
arrangement of the diodes in the bridge.  in which case i should fix
the schematic.
