You can write "Interactive C" (IC) programs on a PC/Mac and download it
into the HB. IC is like C but alot less complicated.  If you know C, it is
pretty simple.  If you don't know C, it is just simple.

You can also write Assembler which is a little harder.  But you only need
this if you want to do some fancy stuff.

To make the motors go forward, you use the statements:

fd(0);
fd(1); 

for motor 0 and 1, respectively.

You can get a motors and sensors beginner pack from "Gleason Electronics",
where you will get your Handy Board from too.
