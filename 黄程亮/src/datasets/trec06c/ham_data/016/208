The first step is to install Acrobat Reader per the instructions that come
with it.  Sounds like you've done that.  The next step (provided you have a
PC running Windows) is to go to the appropriate web page and right-click on
the link for the HB manual.  A context menu pops up, at which point you
choose "Save Link" (or "Save As" or whatever it is), and select a folder.
After the file is downloaded, you simply double-click on it in Windows
Explorer.  That ought to start Acrobat Reader automatically.  Good luck.
