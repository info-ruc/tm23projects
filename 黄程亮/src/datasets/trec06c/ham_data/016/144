Subject: LCD Commands
Priority: normal

Is there some documentation somewhere that shows the commands 
required to talk to the display.  I would like to control the display 
from assembly code and I need to know what these commands are.

I already know how to talk to the display using the A, B, C ports but 
there must be some commands and data that need to be sent to the LCD.

Thanks
