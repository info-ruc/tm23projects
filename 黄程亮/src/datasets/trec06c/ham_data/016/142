- We need to forge stronger collaborations with psychologists.  Researchers
on perceptual issues in virtual environments (Dennis Proffitt, Earl Hunt,
and Jack Loomis all spring to mind) and researchers in psychomotor behavior
(Yves Guiard) have both contributed to our understanding of 3D environments
and inspired interaction techniques.  I believe that there are more
techniques that can be informed by lessons learned from psychology waiting
to be created.  Even something as simple as an optical illusion (which the
Head Crusher technique essentially was) can inspire an interaction technique.

- We need to figure out what VR is good for.  The application domains that
we attack will shape the interaction techniques we create.  For example, if
the user is working at a desk for extended periods in fishtank VR, our
interaction techniques probably shouldn't have the user reach up into the
air for long periods of time.  However, for worlds using a head mounted
display for short periods of time, this type of interaction might not be a
problem.

- More specifically, we need to think harder about what 3D and VR are good
for that other environments aren't.  Given the higher costs of 3D/VR, we
need to have good enough techniques to justify the cost.

- We need to go beyond thinking about VR and interactive 3D graphics as
being simulations of the real world.  Or, to put it another way, we need to
start thinking out of the box.

- We need to think about novel input devices and props.  Touch gloves vs.
WIM clipboard vs. virtual tricorder, etc.  Also issues like general props
for many tasks vs. specific props for single tasks.

That's just a smattering of issues to think about - there are more.

Hey Doug.  Sorry it took me so long to get back to you - I've been buried
under projects and haven't had a minute to myself.

Definitely.  I'm not sure what levels of participation you're looking at,
but at the minimum I can stayed involved in an ongoing email dialog.  More
participation will depend on what's needed and what I'm working on at the
moment.  ;)

I'd suggest Matt Conway (mconway@microsoft.com) and Ken Hinckley
(kenh@microsoft.com).
