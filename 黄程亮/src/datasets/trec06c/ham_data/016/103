Subject: Welcome to the Salt Lake City Java SIG mailing list
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.894379376.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

This message announces the creation of an e-mail list for the Salt
Lake City Java SIG:

	java-sig@math.utah.edu

Requests for additions or deletions, and problem reports, should be
directed to

	java-sig-request@math.utah.edu

This list is maintained by humans, not a mail server, so do not expect
instant response on mail sent to that last address; I am unsatisfied
with current mail server software, and so refrain from using such
packages.  A message with the body

	SUBSCRIBE

or

	SUBSCRIBE jones@foo.bar.com

[if your desired destination address differs from your sending one], or

	UNSUBSCRIBE	

is sufficient to get you on or off the list.

The purpose of this list is

	(1) to carry announcements of the agenda, time, and place
	    of upcoming meetings of the Salt Lake City Java SIG;

	(2) to carry discussions of Java-related issues;

	(3) to carry NON-COMMERCIAL announcements of local Java
	    events, such as workshops, conferences, and trade shows;

	(4) to carry reviews of books and other publications on Java.

Announcements of new Java products are acceptable, PROVIDED that they
are very short (< 5 lines), and they avoid mentioning prices,
advertising hype, or the competition.  An acceptable example might be

>> ...
>> 	The Java Grinder Group is pleased to announce a
>> 	Java-controlled hot-chocolate maker; for details, visit
>> 
>> 		http://www.jgg.com/java-cocoa.html
>> ...

Correspondence on this list is expected to maintain a high degree of
professionalism and courtesy, and also, brevity: many of us already
receive more e-mail than we can reasonably deal with.

Given the large number of books on Java (in 20+ human languages), it
would be helpful if people on this list who have found books that they
find useful, or else detest, would write short reviews about them and
post them to this list.

Subject: Java and floating-point computation
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.894406061.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

Those of you who have not been using Java for floating-point
computations may be unaware of a debate that has been going on for the
past few months in selected circles, with eminent people like three of
the authors of the IEEE 754 floating-point standard (William Kahan [UC
Berkeley, and the grandfather of IEEE 754], David Hough [Sun et al],
and Jerome Coonan [Apple et al]), and noted computer scientists Bill
Joy [UC/Berkeley, and Sun co-founder], Guy Steele [MIT, ..., Sun], and
James Gosling [CMU, ..., Sun, and the father of Java].

The crux of the debate is that the current Java Virtual Machine places
extremely severe restrictions upon the use of floating-point,
including
	    
	(a) all floating-point operations must produce intermediate
	    results in 32-bit or 64-bit precision
	    
	(b) limitations on NaN (not-a-number)
	    
	(c) rounding model is always round-to-nearest, despite
	    the fact that IEEE 754 also defines
	    round-to-minus-infinity, round-to-zero, and
	    round-to-plus-infinity
	    
Point (a) is a very serious performance hit for architectures that
have extended precision arithmetic.  The most notable of these is the
Intel x86 family, where the hardware does its work with 80-bit values
in registers, and only on return to memory are values reduced to 32-
or 64-bit ones.  There is NO hardware instruction that can do this
reduction in the floating-point registers themselves.

Point (a) is also a serious performance hit for architectures that
have fused multiply/add instructions (IBM Power, HP PA-RISC, SGI MIPS
R8000 and R10000, ...), which compute A*B + C in one (pipelined)
cycle, with EXACT computation of the (double-length) product, A*B, and
only one rounding, from the addition.

Given that memory access on current architectures costs from 10 to 30
CPU cycles, if a value must be stored to memory and then reloaded,
just to accomplish a rounding to 32 or 64 bits, then as much as a
factor of 60 in performance can be lost, or even more if the
store-and-reload knocks something out of cache that is going to be
used shortly.  

Given that many implementations of Java are still interpreted
on-the-fly, for a performance hit of perhaps a factor of 100, in bad
cases, code in Java might run 10,000 times slower than it otherwise
could in a compiled language on the same platform [it isn't this bad
in most cases, but an early Java LINPACK benchmark result on a DEC
Alpha was 300 times slower than the Fortran version].  However,
because of Java's many admirable features, there is great interest in
using Java for scientific and engineering computations, PROVIDED that
its performance can be made acceptable.

Point (c) prevents efficient implementation of interval arithmetic,
which computes upper and lower bounds for each floating-point
operation, so that numbers are represented by ranges [a,b], rather
than single values.  Although this kind of arithmetic is not common
today, there is a growing literature, and yearly conferences, on the
subject, and perhaps one day, such arithmetic may be the norm, rather
than the exception.

This debate led to an announcement by Sun Microsystems in late March
1998 that the Java Virtual Machine will be extended to enhance
floating-point arithmetic support: see
	       
	http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/9803/sunflash.980324.17.html

It is mostly press release blurb, with few details, but today, a more
detailed document became available, from James Gosling himself:

If you are interested in this area, I urge you to read it.

Hello all,

I meant to bring this up during the last couple of meetings...

The current preliminary release of JDK1.2 (beta3) for Wintel has an
annoying bug where upon starting the JVM, _all_ of your system's fonts
are loaded regardless of whether your apps use any fonts at all.  I
found that on my PPro 200, starting an application or applet (with
appletviewer) took over 1.5 minutes.  Of course, your annoyance may vary
based on the number of fonts your system has loaded (I've heard someone
say it took their system 8 minutes).

To fix this problem you need to do the following:

1) create a new directory for the fonts you want Java to use.
2) copy any fonts you want from your system fonts directory
("c:\winnt\fonts" under NT) to your new Java fonts directory.
3) create a new environment variable "JAVA_FONTS", and have it reference
your fonts directory.

This reduces the number of fonts that Java will load on JVM startup.
Now my system takes only a few seconds before starting my apps.  Note
that this problem will be fixed for beta4, due out relatively soon from
what I understand, so at that point your separate Java fonts directory
should be unnecessary.

One additional item: I've been hearing lots of horror stories from
developers about the JIT included with the Wintel version of JDK1.1.6.
This is the first _official_ Sun JITed JVM release; previously you could
load a separate app, the Java Performance Pack (JPP), which hooked up a
Symantec JIT for you, but apparently this one is new and quite buggy.
Several developers recommended either disabling the JIT or sticking with
1.1.5 for the time being.  At the very least, try disabling the JIT upon
encountering any strange or elusive bugs in your apps.


Regards,

Subject: graphviz package: drawing diagrams in C, Tcl/Tk, and Java
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.895881039.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

All of you have seen diagrams with boxes and circles and arrows, used
in Officer Oppie's colored glossy 8x10 photographs in the Alice's
Restaurant court proceedings, coaches' instructions to football
players, Ross Perot in campaign speeches, and practically every
computer science book ever written.

While packages such as B. W. Kernighan's "pic", and C. Van Wyk's
"ideal", make it reasonably straightforward to prepare such drawings
from simple textual instructions like

	.PS
	ellipse "document"
	arrow
	box "PIC"
	arrow
	box "TBL/EQN" "(optional)" dashed
	arrow
	box "TROFF"
	arrow
	ellipse "typesetter"
	.PE

(given on p. 1 of the PIC manual), they suffer from the problem that
they cannot determine the true width of arbitrary text strings, and
thus, in real applications, considerable manual twiddling of box sizes
is necessary to get things right.

There is now a new package, called graphviz, that addresses some of
these issues.  In particular, it contains a TrueType font rasterizer,
so that it can do accurate text width computations, and then
automatically resize boxes.  It also has a Tcl/Tk frontend, for
interactive preparation of drawings, and a Java implementation of part
of it.  [I counted 36,672 lines of Java code in the distribution,
which is why I'm posting to this list.]

If this kind of thing interests you, you might wish to get the
software, available from

	http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/

The software is distributed under license from AT&T, but for
non-commercial use, it is essentially an unsupported perpetual
license.  I've just successfully installed it on our Sun Solaris 2.6
systems.

The supported UNIX architectures are HP-PA HP-UX, Linux (on Intel),
DEC OSF/1 Alpha, SGI MIPS, Sun Solaris, and Sun OS.  There are also
Windows versions, though I did not fetch them.

Subject: News item: GJ - A Generic Java Extension
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.896397116.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

This just came in:

                    GJ - A Generic Java Extension

GJ is an extension of the Java programming language that supports
generic types.

*Support for generics*   Many data types are generic over some other
data type, and this is especially common for reusable libraries such
as collection classes.  GJ supports the use of such types, for
instance allowing one to write the GJ type Vector<String> as opposed
to the Java type Vector. With GJ, fewer casts are required, and the
compiler catches more errors.

*Superset of the Java programming language* Every Java source programq
is still legal and retains the same meaning in GJ. The GJ compiler can
be used as a Java compiler.

*Compiles into the Java Virtual Machine*   GJ compiles into JVM code,
so GJ programs run on any Java platform, including Java compliant
browsers. Class files produced by the GJ compiler can be freely mixed
with those produced by other Java compilers.

*Compatible with existing libraries*   One can call any Java library
function from GJ. Further, where it is sensible, one can assign GJ
types to existing Java libraries. For instance, the GJ type
Vector<String> is implemented by the Java library type Vector.

*Efficient translation*   GJ is translated by erasure: no information
about type parameters is maintained at run-time. This means GJ code is
pretty much identical to Java code for the same purpose, and equally
efficient.

*Freely available and fully documented*   The GJ compiler is itself
written in GJ, so it runs on any platform that supports Java. The GJ
compiler is available for download, and there is extensive
documentation.

GJ was designed by Gilad Bracha of JavaSoft, Martin Odersky of the
University of South Australia, David Stoutamire of JavaSoft, and
Philip Wadler of Bell Labs, Lucent Technologies. GJ is based on
Odersky and Wadler's previous work on Pizza, but there are also some
differences.

GJ can be obtained from sites

http://www.cis.unisa.edu.au/~pizza/gj
http://wwwipd.ira.uka.de/~pizza/gj
http://www.math.luc.edu/pizza/gj

The site

http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/wadler/pizza/gj

is still waiting to be updated; it will have the latest version soon.

Cheers

 -- Martin Odersky, Philip Wadler

today, I'd not seen mention of Java among their many efforts.
Now there is:  visit

For serious coding examples, particularly for GUI applications,
I recommend, Dick Baldwin's Java Programming Tutorials.

http://www.phrantic.com/scoop/onjava.html

Some of lessons here are fantastic, I particularly like the advanced
lessons.

For those basic questions try the comp.lang.java.programmer FAQ
http://www.afu.com/javafaq.html

It is a much simplier set of pages, but contains lots of good info.

Enjoy,

Subject: Sun Java programs overview, and Java support in GNU Emacs and make
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.898629730.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

Following a posting to the local Math Dept Java mailing list this
morning, I decided to expand it into a longer-lived document in HTML
form and make it generally available; visit

	http://www.math.utah.edu/~beebe/java/index.html

for details.

Some of the material will be familiar to those of you who are seasoned
Java users, but the section on the support of Java in Makefiles is
completely new, reflecting code I wrote this morning to extend my
Emacs support for the wonderful make utility, which I view as possibly
the greatest software tool ever written.

 *** Introduction to the topic/motivation***

 Due to the limited life-span of today's supercomputers, achieving
 performance portability of parallel codes is of critical importance.
 Although Java was not specifically designed for the computationally
 intensive numeric applications that are the typical fodder of
 supercomputers, its widespread popularity and portability make it an
 interesting candidate for high-performance computing;  however, many
 open research questions remain regarding the viability of high
 performance Java-enabled environments.  These encompass topics ranging
 from compiler/runtime optimizations to the language design to
 interfacing with legacy libraries.

 Papers are solicited for a Special Issue of Scientific Programming,
 tentatively scheduled to be published in July, 1999.
 The purpose of this special issue is to focus on the fast-paced
 developments, experiences and research supporting high-performance
 execution of Java codes for numerical applications.


 Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):

 *** your list of topics

 o JITs/Dynamic compilation
 o Native code generation
 o Analysis of numeric applications
 o Compiler optimizations
 o Garbarge collection
 o Language Specification (floating-point, array, object and  
thread models)
 o JVM design and implementation
 o Scalability issues
 o Highly parallel implementations
 o Distributed/web-based implementaions
 o Interfacing with legacy libraries


      Schedule:
     --------------------------------------------------
     | Submission deadline: July 31, 1998
     | Notification of Acceptance:  December 31, 1998
     | Target month of Special Issue:  July  1999
     --------------------------------------------------


 Authors should follow the Information for Authors at the end of each
 issue of Scientific Programming when preparing their manuscripts for 
 submission. An electronic copy of the manuscript, in Postscript format 
 and viewable with ghostview, should be submitted via electronic mail 
 to the guest editor by July 31, 1998. Submissions
 should include authors names, affiliations, addresses, fax and phone 
 numbers, email addresses, on the cover page. Only original manuscripts
 will be considered. All papers will undergo a peer review  
process. Authors
 will be notified of the final publication decision by December  
31, 1998.

Subject: A Much Higher Performance Java Implementation for Solaris 2.6


Solaris 2.6 Users:

Sun has just released a new implementation of Java 1.2 designed 
specifically for Solaris machines (Sparc and x86) under its
Early Access program at the Java Developers Connection.  It is
available at the URL 

  http://developer.javasoft.com/developer/earlyAccess/jdk1.2/index.html

You have to register with the Java Developers Connection to download
the system but the registration process is trivial.

The implementation features a completely new generational copying
garbage collector, low overhead locking protocols, and a much more
sophisticated JIT compiler (it even does some common subexpression
elimination).  During the past academic year, I spent my sabbatical at
Sun Microsystems Laboratories East working with Java Topics research
group that produced this implementation.  The experimental Java
implementation developed by this research group was so better than
existing Sun products that the Solaris Sofware division of Sun
Microsystems decided to make the research system into a product.

I am interested in hearing how well this implementation performs on
scientific calculations.  It is still a long way from optimized
Fortran, but it runs 12 times faster than JDK 1.1.5 on my favorite
symbolic benchmark (a boolean simplifier).

Check it out.

Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.901756561.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

As I have previous reported on these lists, there has been debate
in the floating-point community about the floating-point restrictions
imposed by the Java Virtual Machine specification.

There is now an official proposal from Sun about what to do
about this:  visit

Axtive Software Corporation is proud to announce the availability
of the JCertify product.

JCertify is a training tool to prepare for the Certified Java(tm)
Programmer Examination.

Organized around the objectives of the Certified Java Programmer
for JDK 1.1 Examination, the tool allows you take practice and
simulated examinations an unlimited number of times.

Features of the JCertify product include:

  o One click install, and one click to run.  Studying for the
    Certified Java Programmer Exam is a time consuming process,
    especially if you are working full time.  We worked hard to
    create an application that was easy to install, and easy to
    run.  While written in Java using the Swing libraries, there
    are no classpath or other environment variable modifications
    to be made by the end user.  Our application also does not
    modify the system classpath or other environment variable
    settings.

  o The user may take our practice and simulated exams an
    unlimited number of times.  Hundreds of exam combinations.

  o Our practice exams allow you to tailor the content of the exam
    to the objectives that you want to study. The practice exams
    ask a question, grades the student's response, and provides a
    detailed answer and explanation. It's like having a personal
    Java(tm) trainer with you where-ever you go.

  o Simulated exams are performed in a timed environment and cover
    all objectives.  The exam is graded upon completion, or upon
    expiration of the time limit. A score is given for each objective
    section and the total score. By identifying your weak areas, our
    exams help you pinpoint topics in which you need additional
    study.

  o Detailed Answers for questions on practice exams.

  o Valuable source code examples, including garbage collection,
    writing and displaying international text, Object Oriented
    methodologies, Threads, and much more ...


Whether you are learning the Java language, or currently pursuing
the Certified Java Programmer designation, JCertify will help you
learn and study more effectively to meet your Certification and
education goals.
