hello

    I have a 6v 2.0amp battery. Its a lead acid battery. What is the right
way to recharge it?
    The reason I ask is because I had a 12v 7amp battery from the same
manyfacturer. I charged it using a car battery charger at the lowest setting
possible. After 2 days, the cells had expanded and the battery was bloated.
I dont want to repeat that!

thanks for any help.
