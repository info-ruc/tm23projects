Subject: LCD Addressing - & - Expanded Mode
Priority: normal

Two questions:

1) I'm having a little trouble figuring out how the LCD is addressed. 
It uses A8 and A8 but also is clocked from Port A.  

Can someone explain how to properly address the LCD using ASM?

2) The Mode B pin is always grounded.  How does the system get put 
into expanded mode since that mode requires Mode B to be high during 
reset?  I assume it must be changed (the mode) by the downloaded 
program. 

Can someone explain this sequence, if I am right?  If I am wrong, can 
someone explain how expanded mode is entered?
