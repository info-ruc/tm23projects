More disturbing is the fact that fd!0 is not on your boot 
devices line.  Can you try booting into DOS and then type

C:\>a:
A:\>b fd!0!9dos

and see what happens.

If it asks "root is from" tell it "fd!0".

Assuming you haven't installed Plan9 onto your hard disk
yet (you're only on disk 1!) b.com's lack of understanding
about 4GB disks shouldn't matter.
