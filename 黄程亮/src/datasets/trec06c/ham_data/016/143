1) Extensibility
2) Extensibility
3) Extensibility
4) Integration of extensible interaction paradigms

Basically, there are a lot of cool interaction ideas that work well in
limited domains, but no one has managed to pull together these techniques
into a decent working system yet.  How can we do real-world work in a
virtual world?  How can we work for extended periods of time?

Other questions: 

1) The classic HMD vs. CAVEs question. I have to admit that I am leaning
towards the CAVE side right now (or projection/large screen interaction at
least).

2) How much of the "Magic" of VR depends upon 
   -  immersion
   -  head tracking
   -  stereo
   -  real-time 3D graphics

Did I respond to this?  I don't think so.  

Yes, I'm interested in participating, but as you can tell from this
response, my participation may be spotty at best.  But I definitely would
like to hear what you guys are up to, and will contribute as often as I
can. 

Now how does this differentiate itself from Ernst Kruijff's CVDE
discussion?

I'll think about more questions.  Gotta run to the "Wrap" Party for our
DisneyQuest shows!
