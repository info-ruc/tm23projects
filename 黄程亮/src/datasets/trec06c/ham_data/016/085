Jaron,

This was done (obviously) to save extra decoding circuitry needed on 
the board.

That is, if the handy board needed to assign (say) 7000 as the motor 
then sixteen address lines need to be decoded (binary 0111 000 000 
000).
Yet with the address of 7000 - 7FFF, only the first four bits 
(binary 0111 = 7) need to be decoded.

This is essentially wasteful in memory locations, yet with plently of 
address space this is not really a problem.
