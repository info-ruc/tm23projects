 hello,
i was wondering if anyone can help me.i dont own a handyboard yet,  how do you
program it, i am worried that it is very compicated to do. please if you could
send me some simple code say to move both drive motors fwd, how would you do
it?
 i am just trying to get a feel for it so i can decide if the handyboard is
for me, also where do i get one with motors sensors etc...
thanks -mike
