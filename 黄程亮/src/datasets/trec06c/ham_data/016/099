Hello Community,

I would like to enter the "World of HandyBoard" and I'm searching for a
Distributor in Germany (or some people who know how to get one in
Germany). I would buy it in every state: ready-made, kit and PCB only.

Is there a community of HandyBoard-Useres in Germany?

Thanks in advance, Have Fun

Kai Glaesner
