Mike,

>  hi i am looking for a handyboard, i saw one at trinity college it

The best place for all information about the handy board, including 
the places to buy, is the Handy Board Home page.

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/handy-board/index.html

To get directly to the page on where to buy them, then go here:

ndex.html

We (at the Uni) purchased ours from

                        Patrick Hui, based in Hong Kong, offers Handy
                        Board kits and assembled systems.

Programming the HandyBoard is very simple.  Not much effort at all.
The information received from the Handy Board explains how to program 
it.
As for sample code, it depends on how you intend to program it.
You can program in C, or you can program in machine code.

It is best to possible obtain a Handy board first, then try 
programming.
