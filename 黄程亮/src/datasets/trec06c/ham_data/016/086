Recently, many of you have had pretty specific hardware-related questions.
The best thing to do is to read Appendix B of the MIT 6.270 Robot Builder's
Guide (Appendix A of the new 1998 Course Notes).  This appendix contains a
complete description of the 6.270 hardware.  "Nearly all of the technical
discussion translates directly into an explanation of how the Handy Board
works."  The software describes the memory mapping of output and input
devices (using Y0-Y5, multiplexing w/ a '374), the motor drivers, analog
inputs, serial communication, IR recv/xmit, etc.  The information presented
in the Appendix is invaluable for both tinkerers and the curious.
