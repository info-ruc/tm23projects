Mike,

Chuck McManis may have answered your request, but in case you still 
want sample code I am attaching an example code that prints to the 
HandyBoard display.
(The code forms part of the Handy Board buffalo I had developed).

I had trouble getting the display working as well.
The main problems were:

1.  In single line display, the display is to dark to read.
     Putting the display in two line, allowed the writing on the 
     display to be read. 

2.  You first need to send a 'Display On' code to the display, 
     before any future writes to the display will work.
