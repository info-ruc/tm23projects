No it's actually quite easy, the only thing is you have to do a lot of soldering.
Be careful of the HC373 which is mounted directly onto the board as if it is
damaged by heat, then you will have a "nice" time desoldering it...
To drive both forward, all you need to do is:

void BothForward() {
  fd(0);
  fd(1);
}
This will drive the motors on outputs 1 and 2 forward. Why don't you go download
the manual?
