I had exactly the same problem.  There is a CMOS chip by Motorola called
the MC14028B that is a BCD-to-decimal or Binary-to-octal decoder.  All
that really matters though is that it will take a 4-bit input and
decode up to *10* outputs that are *active high*.  I know it is not
16 as desired, but if you can live with just ten, it should suit you
fine.

Good luck, Skye.
