The message

> cmd=00, lastcmd=A0 cdsize count 14, status 0x50, error 0x00

probably means that an ATAPI cd-rom is returning 14 bytes of data
instead of 18 to a Creqsense command.  That's what my Mitsumi FX400
does.  You can make the message go away by changing
	if(cp->count != 18){         /* ?Mitsumi? */
to
	if(cp->count != 18 && cp->count != 14){
in devata.c (it doesn't seem to do any harm).
