Subject: DS1233 Monitor Chip
Priority: normal

I cannot locate a DS1233 chip.  I have tired DigiKey, Jameco, Mouser, 
Active.  What is a good source for this part?

I have an MC34064.  Looks similiar except that it has no 350mSec 
delay and a different pinout.  Has anyone tried this chip without any 
caps?

Motorola warns against using caps at the input of the RESET circuit.  
I also don't see any notes that indicate that a delay is even 
necessary.  Looks like this chip should work fine without any caps.

Thanks
