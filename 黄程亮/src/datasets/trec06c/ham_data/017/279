i have a motor that is manufactured by lego, and has a 4 pin connector which
is in the shape of a lego block.  i am new to lego robots, so i do not know
what the various parts look like exactly.  the motor that i have is about
1.25" cube, and seems to be geared down slightly.  does anyone know if lego
manufactures DC motors that are geared down, or any DC motors at all, or just
servo motors.  i think that this is a servo, and i also need to find
literature for this device, as i do not have any.  can anyone help me identify
this device?  thanks for your help.
