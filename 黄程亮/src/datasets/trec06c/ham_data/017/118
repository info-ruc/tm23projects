Subject: Where can I find spec. of the LM052L
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

I have an equivalent LCD screen (sharp L16255),
I think, but it is a bit different from the LM052L
and I am not sure how to interface it to the handy board.

I cannot find any spec. on neither of these LCD screen
and just need a hint maybe.

Thanks

Sebastien
