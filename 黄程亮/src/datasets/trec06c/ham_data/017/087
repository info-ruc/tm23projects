Subject: Motors, Part 2

Ok, I now realize that I only need one or the other motor driver.  Now here
is the problem.

Nothing happens.  I type fd(0); in IC and the motors do noting.  I have pin
3 of the Wirz board going to pin 1 of the HB motor driver socket.  Pin 7 of
the Wirz board goes to pin 2 of the HB.  Pin 5 is tied low.  Am I missing
something here?

The motors just make weird noises and nothing happens.  HELP!
