Has anyone altered u9fs to use _conform.map? I want to boot a
Sun (an IPC: there seem to be a lot of them about all of a sudden!)
from a Unix machine, at least until I get the Sun's disc sorted
for Plan 9.

If not, I suppose I could get the mangled names onto the Sun's
disc and then go through the filesystem correcting them after
the fact.

Comments?
