Hello all,  

I am using neural nets to control my robot, and currently have to 
download the weights to the handyboard every time I power on.  This is 
a perfect application for using persistent global variables, but alas 
I am having troubles.  

My smallest network consists of 21 floats (84 bytes), but if I try to 
make more than 14 or 15 floats (56-60 bytes) persistent (it seems to 
depend on whether they are arrays or not) I get the friendly message 
"Board Syncronization Error", which I interpret as "Out of Persistent 
Global Space."

Does anybody know the size of this persistent global space?  If indeed
it is about 60 bytes, are there any known workarounds?  (e.g. can I
write the weights to an unused part of RAM and somehow grab the values 
when I start up?)

Cheers, Skye.
