1/2" is actually pretty good range for a basic reflectance sensor.
try using them in the analog inputs -- you should get readings that
let you read out to about 1".

to get better than that, you need a modulated signal, like Pandit has
described.

In your message you said:
> I interfaced 3 infrared optosensors to the digital inputs on the handyboard. 
I'm a little dissapointed in their performance however. The only time they give
 a reading of "true" is if they are about a half an inch or closer from the tar
get. Any further away than half an inch results in a "false" reading because th
e sensors are out of range.

inches away from what they are to detect. If anyone has been using the optosens
ors I'd like a little input.
