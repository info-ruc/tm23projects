        My understanding is that 7.2V will work fine.  I suspect 9.6V is
used simply because 8 AA NiCd's fit so well in the specified box.  
        The chief concerns here are: (1) do you have enough voltage overhead
for the 7805; and (2) can you draw enough (instantaneous) current for your
motors?  This is not a question of capacity (mah), just amps.
        Unless your motors are small and VERY efficient, I believe Lithium
cells won't work.  I don't know about NiMH; you'll have to check the specs.
Remember, motors can pull big currents when stalled or under load.
