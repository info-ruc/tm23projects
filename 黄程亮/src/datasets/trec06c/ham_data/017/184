...was just wondering if the Handy-Board can run on other types of batter=
ies besides Ni-Cds, such as: NiMH batteries which have higher mAh ratings=
 vs. a Ni-Cd equivalent. Also, will Lithium batteries work with the HB?

Are there any performance differences to the HB if you run it on 7.2 volt=
s instead of 9.6 volts? From what I've heard the voltage regulator (7805)=
 regulates anything from 6-18 volts down to the 5 volts for the circuit. =
If this is so, why was 9.6V decided on?
