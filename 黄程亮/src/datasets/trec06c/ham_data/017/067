Hi all,

i have problems during download the new smooth-pwm routine into my
handyboard. All times my downloader stopped
after few seconds with an error message "EOF after 1xxx Bytes ....."

I had download the sourcecode and the zip file from internet. I get the
same error message.

I=B4m using a macintosh (PPC 4400) and use the 6811 download utility. Is
it possible to get an ICB-smooth-pwm-pcode ?

Thank=B4s for help

bye Bernd Klein
