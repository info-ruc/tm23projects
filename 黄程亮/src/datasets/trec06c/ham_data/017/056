Thanks,

I was going to use a pad/hole size of .050/.028.  The default size of 
my library uses .050/.025. 

I checked some pin size data and it shows .015 (min) to .023 (max).  
Allowing .008 to .010 extra and .003 for plating, it seems that the 
best size might be something more like .065 for the pad and .034-.036 
for the hole size.

Vias are a little less important.  I was going to use .040/.020 but 
that seems a little large.  

I checked the gerber files for then handyboard and they have only two 
hole sizes, in this range.  One is .028 and the other is .035.  I 
would assume the via hole is .028 and the pin hole is .035 (what I 
calculated).  I guess the via size is not so large after all.

Thanks
