Subject: Which R4 should I use???
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I notice that in hbmanual.pdf there is
a different value for R4 than in hba.pdf
since I used the list of hbmanual, I bought
R4=2.94k precision resistor, but in the asembly
file it says 3.83k precision resistor.

Which one is the good one and why need I a
precision resistor if the value can differ that much?
