You must manual consolidate the new driver with the smooth-pwm
libraries.

To consolidate, 

1.  edit the smooth-pwm lib_hb.c, and remove the function
"_raw_analog()",

2.  install the new lib_hb.icb file in your IC lib directory (this
contains the assembly-language replacement for _raw_analog), and

3.  add lib_hb.icb to your lib_hb.lis master library file.
