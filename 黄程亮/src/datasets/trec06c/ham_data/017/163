The two on the left are + battery voltage and the two on the right are
ground.  They're doubled up to handle more current, I guess.

Make sure that you're getting 9.6 V at the motor power header, and that
you have your six diodes (to drop the voltage from 9.6 V down to 6.0 V)
wired up with the correct polarity.

The two ribbon cables that I got with my pair of sonar modules had the
stripes wrong (one had the stripe on the pin 1 conductor and the other
on pin 9), so you should check that yours are hooked up correctly
regardless of the stripe.  With the cable coming straight up out of the
sonar module, make sure the shape of the plug matches the shape of the
footprint of the board connector J1 (i.e., four pins on the top and five
pins on the bottom, when the board is viewed "right side up" relative to
the printing on it).

Note:  I'm not an authority on sonar; I haven't gotten mine to work yet,
either.  Good luck.
