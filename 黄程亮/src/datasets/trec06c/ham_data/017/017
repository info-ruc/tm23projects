I am using an 811E2 part in my handyboard with IC.  It is supposed to 
have problems with this chip.  I have not disabled the EEPROM but it 
still seems to work.

I have been having a problem finding the A1FN part.  I do not want to 
buy anymore of the 811E2 parts but I can find the E1FN part.  I would 
like to ask a question to those who have experience with these 
EEPROM parts.

I have been told that the 811E2 part will not work with IC because 
the EEPROM overlaps the SRAM. So, why does mine work?  What kind of 
problems can I expect by using this part?  The config reg. in this 
part, apparently, gets reset back to the original location after 
every reset.  I would like to move the EEPROM to some other location, 
maybe 2000Hex to make my handyboard completely compatible.  How can I 
do this if the config reg is continually reset?  What specific?

Assuming the E1 is a better part than the 811E2 for the 
handyboard,...

How compatible is the E1FN (512 EEPROM) part with the handyboard? 
What specifically is required to get it to work?
