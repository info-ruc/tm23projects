I was just wondering if there's any way to disable and remove the LCD scr=
een and still have the HB work. My design does not require the LCD, so if=
 i could remove it my robot would then be a little more balanced. Every t=
ime I remove the LCD my programs wont run.=20

*maybe this question should be directly aimed at a response from Randy & =
Fred.

Thanks in advance, and I *REALLY* hope there is a way to do this!
