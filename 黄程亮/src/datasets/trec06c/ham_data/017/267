Hi Brian,

    I believe you are trying to implement the proximity sensor for object
avoidance
    or collision avoidance, correct ? I believe the QT1114 is designed for
the range the you
    have found. The spec. of the part also indicate the very near range
about 1/4 inch. 
    I have found similar result.  Try the IR detector that is used for
remote control. You can
    get one from Radio Shack, the one that is in the can and has 3 pins
behind
    the can.  With this detector, the IR Tx must be OSC about 38k-40k Hz.
You
    can adjust the range by varying the freq. around. 

    Here is info on IR detector:
