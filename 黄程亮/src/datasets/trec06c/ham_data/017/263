I interfaced 3 infrared optosensors to the digital inputs on the handyboa=
rd. I'm a little dissapointed in their performance however. The only time=
 they give a reading of "true" is if they are about a half an inch or clo=
ser from the target. Any further away than half an inch results in a "fal=
se" reading because the sensors are out of range.

Is there any way at all to have a bigger range. I want to have the sensor=
s 2 inches away from what they are to detect. If anyone has been using th=
e optosensors I'd like a little input.

-Should I use smaller resistors on the sensors?

-Is the range short because of how fast the digital(); function checks th=
e sensor? If it took longer to check would it then give the sensor more t=
ime to let the infrared beam to reflect back?

-Do I need stronger optosensors all together?
( I'm using the Quality Tech. 1114, as shown in the HB manual )

Thanks in advance,
