The reason the board is not responding seems to be because the downloader=
 is sending data to the wrong COM port. Find out whether you are using CO=
M1 or COM2 and then check your downloader and IC as well to confirm you a=
re on the right port.

from the DOS prompt type:

dl -config

~then hit {enter} until the port selection comes up. (you can type either=
 com1 or com2, type the correct one.
continue to hit enter until you have exited the config mode.

next type:

ic -config

~go through the same steps as the downloader config.
your downloader should now send to the correct port. IC should also recog=
nize the board now too.

hope this helps.
