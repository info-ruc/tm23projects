Hi all,

Did anybody see my previous questions about polaroid 6500 ?
(except for Will, thanks):

Can I use the motor(3,75) statement to create enough voltage ?

I think my polaroid board is damaged, how can I know for sure ?

How can I repair it ?

Which chip is most likely to be damaged ?

Thank you in advance for any comment !!
