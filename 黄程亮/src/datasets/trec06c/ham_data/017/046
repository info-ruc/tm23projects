Hi Mike

check with your board manufacturer for production specification.

The via hole size I resently used was 12mil with a via size of 16mil.

For Pad/Hole Width use the specifications of the parts you want to put
on your board.
A hole should be 8-10mil wider than the pin you want to put in.

Tom
