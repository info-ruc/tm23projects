I've had pretty good luck getting up to around 2" by using a standard IR
LED and standard IR phototransistor, modulating the IR LED in software,
and looking at the analog value returned from the phototransistor like
so:

{
  int refl;
  led_on();  refl +=3D analog(1);  led_off();  refl -=3D analog(1);
  led_on();  refl +=3D analog(1);  led_off();  refl -=3D analog(1);
  led_on();  refl +=3D analog(1);  led_off();  refl -=3D analog(1);
  printf("Reflectance is %d\n", refl);
}

You want to use a high-powered IR LED and put around 100 ma through it.
