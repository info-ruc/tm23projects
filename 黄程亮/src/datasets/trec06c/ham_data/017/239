The motor state is insignificant before the board has booted.  I.e.,
the fact the motors are on the red direction means nothing; it's just
the random state of the motor output latch when the board turns on
without a program.

The LCD screen should not have a solid black band, however.  This
usually indicates a power problem.  Check that you have a legitmate
+5v on your board's power ckt.

Also, you should see the following LED behavior:

1. before download:  BATT and PWR LEDs fully off
2. during download:  PWR LED flashes
3. after download:   PWR LED on steady

If (1) is not true, then your board is not in download mode.  Download
cannot proceed until the board is powered on with both of these LEDs off.

If (2) is not true, then your board is not receiving data from your
PC.  Check your interface board power, serial cable, and telephone cable.

If (3) is not true, then something else indeterminate went wrong.
