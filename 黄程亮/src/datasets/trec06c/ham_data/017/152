 Hello. I have working with a handyboard, and I am trying to obtain 
 information on how to properly use a eltec 442-3 pyroelectric sensor. I 
 bought a complete one with a lens. My objective is for my lego robot to 
 locate either a flame or heat source, and right now I have it hooked up to 
 analog port 0. I had seen in the older version of  lib_hb,c, something 
 to the effect of a left and right pyro, however the recent versions of the 
 lib_hb.c do not seem to have anything like that. 
 
 The other question I am trying to figure out is that the eltec 442-3 has 
 four wires, one is ground, +5 volts, the signal, and a 2.5v reference. I 
 have not hooked up the 2.5v reference wire, however I thought I had read 
 something to the effect that it was not used, which I think I am wrong. IF 
 I do have to hook up the 2.5v reference wire, what's the best way to do 
 this??? Would you possibly have the drivers for the pyro sensors?????? 
 
 I know that right now, with IC 3.2, if I do a reading by typing analog(0);, 
 the values do not seem very stable, however when I put a candle about a 
 foot away from it, the analog(0) reading goes down to 6-10, after a little 
 but however, it does change by up to as much as 126.. 


 
 Any direction would be greatly appreciated.
