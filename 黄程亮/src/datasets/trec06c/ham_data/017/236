A few more questions...

Outside the context of communication and channels, is it meaningful to
talk about information?  Could information be a fundamental property of
physical systems?  Could it be "all in our heads?"

At the quantum level:
        Is information different from measurement?
        Is measurement different from interaction?
        Where is the magical boundary between clasical and quantum, and
        does it have any bearing on constructing computational systems?

Many functions are not computable with Turing machines.  Do physical
processes reflect any non-computable operations?  If so, can these
"non-computable" operations form the basis of a super-Turing
architecture?

More generally, is the universe computable? (Are there any non-computable
operations at the quantum level) Is it computable at any scale?  Can a
system be computable at one scale and not at another?  What is the
relationship between finiteness and (Turing) computability?  Is there any
real difference between an infinite language/state machine and one that is
simply very, very large?
