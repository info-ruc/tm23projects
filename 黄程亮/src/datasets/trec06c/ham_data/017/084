1) we made a mailing group alias - babbage.  after one of the first
persons to talk about how to do computation in a physical system.

2) members so far:
edward boyden, ben vigoda, yael maguire, ebeth haley and rich devaul.

3) yael and edward and I would like to start meeting next week.  how
about the same traditional wednesday afternoon, since we know that is
free, and is most likely not to get interfered with by any long summer
weekends?  1pm still okay?

4) I assume we can use 054.

5) I propose to run it exactly like a Swarthmore honors seminar:  on a
given week we pose some problem(s) like the ones below.  then we take it
as homework along with a bibliography (provided by Neil G. and us) of
relevant reading and try to solve it.  One person (round robin) is named
presenter for the following week.  They will have to give a 1/2 hr. talk
to assimilate the material for everyone else and be able to lead the other
people through the solution to the problems.  They will be like the
professor for that week.  Then we get together and the presenter talks,
and then we talk through the problems.

If that is too much pressure on the presenter, we could assign one person
If that is too much pressure on the presenter, we could assign one person
to present each problem in advance.  alternately we could do it just like
P.I.T. whatever you folks prefer.

The assignment for this coming wednesday is to come prepared with a list
of problems you are interested in and a modestly researched bibliography
to go with each one.

some sample problems:

a) can you build a computer with two classical electron charges and how?
b) if you have a function f(x) does it take energy to compute it?
c) how much energy does it take to compute ax+b, x^2, x^3, exp(x), etc.
d) what is the relationship between the degrees of freedom in a system
and it's computational power?
e) what did shannon say about entropy and information?
f) what is the behavior of different types of matrices when you
mulitiply by them iteratively? (pet ben problem)
g) what is the relationship between nonlinearity and computation?  (we
know the answer already, do you?)
h) how does shor's algorithm work?  what are the candidate areas for new
quantum lagorithms?
i) why would nonlinearity in quantum physics lead to the ability to
CA turing machine?  is it provable?
do you?
j) what is the curse of dimensionality?
k) what is the blessing of dimensionality?
l) what is all that nonlinearity inside the parameters versus outside the
parameters stuff? a la Andrew Barron paper...
m) How can we understand what AFSR is doing?  (ben pet problem)
n) given a *>nonlinear<* differential equation, CA, etc system evolving in
time, is there always a way to analytically to find the state of the
system at arbitrary time and are we just too stupid to find it?  Why do
we always have to simulate nonlinear systems in order to observe their
behavior?  Why can we always find an analytical soultion to a linear
system that gives us the state at arbitrary time in the future?  what
does this all have to do with the halting problem?  (we know the answer,
do you?)
0) what about a  state space/ lag space tells you if a system is a
physical system or a computer?  what do you have to do the lag space/
state space of a system to make it into a computer?
p) embedding: why is the number of relevant lags in a lag space equal to
the number of degrees of freedom of a system?
q) construct a minimal CA turing machine.  what is the smallest possible
CA turing machine?  is it provable?
r) can one build a microwave oven that refrigerates instead of heats?  how?
s) what does charlie bennet have to say?
r) can one build a microwave oven that refrigerates instead of heats?  how?
s) what does charlie bennet have to say?
t) what does strang have to say?
u) what is the difference between a classical CA and a quantum CA?
v) what is a quantum CA?
