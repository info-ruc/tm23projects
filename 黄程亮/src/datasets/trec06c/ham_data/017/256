HELLO,
    MY NAME IS CHRIS RHODES AND I AM CONFUSED ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN A SERVO MOTOR AND A DC MOTOR.  THE HANDYBOARD LITERATURE SAYS
THERE ARE THE 4 DC MOTOR OUTPUTS AND 1 DIGITAL INPUT THAT CAN USED AS A
SERVO OUTPUT.  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN HOW YOU DRIVE THE DIFFERENT
MOTORS.  ANY HELP WOULD BE APPRECIATED.  THANK YOU

CHRIS RHODES
