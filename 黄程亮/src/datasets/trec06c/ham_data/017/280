What you have is most likely a 9V DC motor, not a servo.  As far as I know, 
there is no such thing as a Lego servo motor.  The four-contact plug is a Lego 
standard that allows changing the polarity simply by rotating the plug 90 
degrees.  There are actually just two wires going to the motor.

There are two main types of 9V Lego Technic motor:  the old, non-geared style 
and the new gear motor.  (There are also the Technic micro-motor and various 
non-Technic motors, like the kind that come with the railroad sets).  The 
Technic gear motor has the contacts  recessed into the top and a slot for the 
wire also in the top.  The regular (non-gear) motor is a plain old rectangular 
block shape with the contacts on the bottom.

Both types of Lego Technic motor seem to be quite efficient and can be run 
directly from the HB without the need for a separate motor battery pack.  I 
think that the new gear motors are better than the old, block-shaped motors, 
mainly because they're more compact (require fewer external gears to achieve 
usable RPM) and probably more efficient, too.  At $18 or so, the new gear motor 
is about the least expensive gear motor you'll find.

I have been unable to find any specs on these motors, but then I haven't really 
looked for 'em.
