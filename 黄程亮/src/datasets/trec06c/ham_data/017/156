Hi,

I am trying to install the polaroid 6500.
I use the schematics I found with the sonar.c file at this site.
It doesn't work, I dont understand the Motor power connection why does
it have 4 pins ?
One motor only uses 3 pins ?
I think the sonar device doesnt get enough voltage, I only measure
around 0.5 volts ?
Does the striped side of the ribbon-cable goes in number 1 of the socket
on the polaroid board ? (etc. etc.).

Who can help me and give me some tips and tricks ?

I really want to see this thing working !

Thanks,

Jan Luijk.
