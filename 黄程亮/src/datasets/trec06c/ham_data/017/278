This subject has most probably been discussed numerous times but I'm kinda
new to this mailing list and the Handyboard so bare with me. What are the
pros and cons of using Lego motors to drive a robot project that I have in
mind ???, should I scrape this idea and go for servos ???

Any comments would be hugely appreciated.

One other quick question, are there any UK based Handyboard user groups???

Thanks in advance
