For servo, there is a certain threshold duty cycle (say 50%) of the PWM
signal, where anything above this threshold will make it to run forward,
and less will make it to run backward. So, you still need to apply the PWM
even if the servo is not moving.
And this is because servo is originally used for moving at certain amount
of angle, once it is modified as a driving unit, that angular feedback
device within the servo will also be modified. And the detail of how it
works has somthing to do with the threshold duty cycle. Please correct me
if I am wrong, as I am also thinking about using dc motor or servo.
