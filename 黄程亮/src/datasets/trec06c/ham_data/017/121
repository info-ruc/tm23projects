Subject: setting the best PWM frequency for DC motor
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

hello everyone, I found some information on "How do I set best PWM
parameters for DC motors?" from the "Robotics Information" homepage, 
http://www.hut.fi/Misc/Electronics/robotics.html

and inside it described that in order to make current to flow steadily in
between pulses, you need to satisfy this condition:

2*pi*f*L >> R

where f = swithching frequency
	L = armature inductance
	R = armature resistance
and >> is much greater than

I am wondering why is this the case and how this will make the current to
flow steadily?? I could not found the reference book where this infomation
is come from, so does anyone know anything about this and explain to me
please?
