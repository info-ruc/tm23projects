I had a similar problem a couple months ago and solved
it with disk space.  I copied the entire CD onto a Unix
disk and then did something approximately:

	cat _conform.map | sed 's/^F/f/g;s/^D/d/g' | sort > $HOME/conform.map

	% cat $HOME/fix
	#!/bin/sh

	for i in *	
	do
		if test -d $i
			(cd $i; $HOME/fix)
	done

	for i in d00* f00*
	do
		x=`look $i $HOME/conform.map`
		mv $i $x
	done
	% cd $HOME/plan9cd
	% $HOME/fix

which worked pretty well.  A warning: I just
typed that shell script on the fly while writing this
message.  I can't find the one I used when I did it,
but that conveys the basic gist.
