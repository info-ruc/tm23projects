your Interactive C is not loading the correct libraries.  Make sure IC
is configured to load lib_hb.lis, NOT lib_r22.lis.  Get the latest
lib_hb.c, lib_hb.lis, and lib_hb.icb from the Software resources area
of the HB web site.

The correct value is 3.93k.  Where exactly do you still see 2.94K?
This should have been expunged.
