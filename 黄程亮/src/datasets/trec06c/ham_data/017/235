i am still having trouble with getting the PC to communicate with the
handyboard.  all conections seem to be correct, and the programs are
configured correctly, but the thing will still not communicate properly.
mabye there is a fault in the board itself, i am wondering what the screen
should display in the bootstrap mode, i have a dark black bar in the top line,
and nothing in the bottom.  this is also what is on screen when the board is
"on".  is this correct?  also, in any mode, the four red lights are on
indicating a motor direction.  should these be on during bootstrap mode?
during download with "dl", the program downloads with no trouble, "dl" seems
happy about what happens, but then when "trying to synchronize" does not work,
it returns "failed".  this has been as far as i got.  to check the board, i
tried to design a small assembler program that would use an XIRQ ISR to jmp to
a line of code on the zero page to drive port B pins hi, but it would not
download either.  my concern, and opinion, is that i have a malfunctioning
board.  please help.  thank you.
