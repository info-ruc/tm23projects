As I've said, I think the new Lego Technic gear motors are a great deal.  They're inexpensive (about $18 each), they seem to 
be quite efficient, and they run well directly from the HB power supply.  If 
you're building your robot out of Legos (and maybe even if you're not), then I 
personally recommend the new Lego Technic gear motors.

If you do get servos, make sure they're the kind with the full circular gears, 
so that you can hack them for continuous rotation (I've heard that some of the 
smaller servos out there have partial gears).  Tower Hobbies has good prices 
(they're on the web).  Bear in mind that you might need a separate battery pack 
for the motors if they can't handle 9.6 V.
