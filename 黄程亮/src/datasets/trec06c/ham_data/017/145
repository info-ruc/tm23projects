Subject: Legos

Does anyone have any experience with any of the Lego technic systems.  I am
looking for a car/truck that has motors (or can add motors to), has enough
room for a handyboard, and has the rack and pinion steering.  I would also
need a servo for the steering, but I haven't found a "lego servo" and I
want that clean look.

Also, has anyone made a snazzy enclosure for the hb using legos, or should
I just glue some to the existing case?

Thanks for you input.


Mike
