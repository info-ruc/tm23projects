i have been trying to get the pcode_hb.s19 file downloaded to the handyboard,
and the farthest that i got was the file downloaded (using 'dl' and 'dlm'
downlloaders) but then the PC couldnt synchronize with the handyboard.  i have
a series 'a' board, and am using DOS.  when i go ahead and try to use IC even
though the file has not downloaded properly, by first turning the board off,
then turning it back on, nothing but an all black strip comes on on the top
row of the display, and nothing on the bottom row, not the interactive C
welcome that is described in the literature.  as for what happens when i try
to run the program(IC), the program tries to connect to the board, but it says
that the board is not responding.  for some reason the program can succesfully
download the file to the board, but not communicate with it to accomplish any
other functions.  any suggestions?
