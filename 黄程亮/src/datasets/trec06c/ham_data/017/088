Hi

The SPI Header is connected to port D of the hc11 as follows:

Port D Bit 2 - PD2 - MISO
Port D Bit 3 - PD3 - MOSI
Port D Bit 4 - PD4 - SCK
Port D Bit 5 - PD5 - SS

All of those pins can be used for general-purpose I/O signals.

To program port D you have the following registers:

* DDRD (Data Direction Register Port D) $1009
For output set the corresponding bit to 1.
All bits 0 (input) after reset.

* PORTD (POrt D Data) $1008
Read or Write data through this register.

* SPCR (Serial Peripheral Control) $1028
Make sure that the SPI is turned off.
Bit 7 and Bit 6 of this register must be cleared (0).
Bit 7 - SPI interrupt
Bit 6 - SPI enable

With bit 5 (DWOM) you can control the Port D mode
(Port D Wired-OR Mode option)
DWOM = 0 Normal CMOS outputs
DWOM = 1 Open-drain outputs

For further information about port D please refer to the HC11A8 technical
manual.

it's the pdf or ps file MC68HC11A8/D

Hope that helps.
