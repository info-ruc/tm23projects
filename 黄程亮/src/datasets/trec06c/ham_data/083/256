Hello former fellows,

My graduate advisor has asked me for some help determining what institutes 
could take graduate science policy interns (paid for by someone else) Please 
send me ideas and contact information if you can, ASAP. His note to me is 
below.

As usual, thanks ahead of time for your help.

Cheers,
Audrey Ichida

>Hi Audrey,
>	We are working on an interdisciplinary graduate student training
>grant at UCSD, The Salk Institute and The Scripps Research Institute that 
>focuses on genomics,
>proteomics, and computational biology  (bioinformatics). This graduate 
>program will include the option for students to do either an internship in 
>a laboratory abroad or in the biotechnology industry. We would also like to 
>include the option of doing a science policy internship. Such an internship 
>would take place during a summer for about 6 weeks. The stipends and travel 
>costs of the student would be covered by the training grant. I assume that 
>this program might send one selected and highly qualified student to do a 
>public/science policy internship every year. My problem is that I don't 
>know any organization that could support us in placing summer 
>science/public policy interns. Do you have some good advice. A preproposal 
>is due in about 4 days, and therefore it would be helpful to receive
>feedback or suggestions. Feel free to call or email me.
>with best wishes,
>Julian
