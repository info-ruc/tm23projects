This paper discusses a new routing implementation called CEDAR: a 
Core-Extraction Distributed Ad hoc Routing Algorithm. One of the primary 
advantages or feature of CEDAR is that it supports QoS routing, which is 
the prioritization of applications that are transported through networks, 
to ensure that "mission critical packets" are sent even in times of network 
congestion (in this case ad hoc ones). At the heart of the CEDAR 
Architecture is this notion of nodes communicating solely with "core nodes" 
that are in the vicinity of them. These core nodes are responsible for the 
discovery and maintenance of all nodes that are communicating with it. This 
"dominating set of core nodes" is known as the spine architecture that 
limits the high costs of memory exhaustion and bandwidth consumption 
associated with network broadcasts. The next feature is the use of increase 
and decrease waves (an interesting new method of propagation) through which 
routes satisfying certain bandwidth thresholds are discovered and 
maintained in an effort to ensure that the route can support QoS.

One of the weaknesses of the CEDAR algorithm is the limitation on the types 
of network topology that CEDAR can support. First, the authors contend that 
the protocol can support networks up to hundreds of nodes. Their simulation 
unfortunately isn't close to that level of scalability. Second, I think 
that the simulation also needs to address how CEDAR performs in clustered 
compared to non-clustered networks. Also, I was interested in seeing the 
amount of memory and power that is conserved with a spine architecture in a 
less clustered distribution. Also, just reading about power conservation 
peeks my interest in examining the level of power consumed in a spine 
architecture, specifically, amongst the "core nodes." This may have some 
deleterious effects in sustaining larger networks.

I think the biggest issue with QoS in general is the level and number of 
parameters that need to be set in order to ensure that mission critical 
data is sent. Also, as the network topology changes and more nodes add and 
some nodes leave the network, these constraints need to be recalculated and 
maintained which can prove to be difficult and exhaustive. Calculating 
these constraints (i.e. threshold's for bandwidth) are significant to 
maintaining a QoS network.
