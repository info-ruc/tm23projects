PARO identifies the problem that resources are limited w/ current day
mobile devices and there needs to be some recognition of the importance of
power consumption in ad-hoc networks.  Basic idea is that if you can trade
off some efficiency (not getting there in one hop) w/ a significant
decrease in power consumption you should take it.

Like the other paper for today, I ask if this is really a full routing
algorithm?  I doesn't seem that it will work very well w/ real network
conditions (nodes coming or going, packet loss).

PARO does get kudos for finally addressing the power consumption issue
however, as it is the first to do so.  The paper also has a simulation and
implementation (albeit rudimentary, but at least its something) to
demonstrate the work.
