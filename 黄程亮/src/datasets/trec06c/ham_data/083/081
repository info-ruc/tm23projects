Hello,

Lesson Study: A Handbook of Teacher-Led Instructional Change by Catherine
Lewis is now available from Research for Better Schools at an introductory
price of $19.99 through December 31, 2002.

A brief description, along with an order form, is included in the body of
this e-mail message.
----------------------------------------
Lesson study - the form of professional development long favored by
Japanese teachers - has recently been initiated by teachers at many sites
across North America. This handbook illuminates both the key ideas
underlying lesson study and the practical support needed to make it succeed
in any subject area. In lesson study, teachers plan, observe, and refine
"research lessons" designed to bring to life their long-term goals for
student learning and development. Japan's steady improvement of mathematics
and science instruction since World War II is credited by researchers to
teacher-led lesson study. Nine chapters address topics including the basic
steps of lesson study, supports, misconceptions, system impact, and how to
pioneer lesson study in your set-ting. The handbook provides practical
resources including schedules, data collection examples, pro-tocols
for lesson discussion and observation, and instructional plans for
mathematics, science, and language arts. Contributions by US lesson study
pioneers Lynn Liptak, Tad Watanabe, and Makoto Yoshida highlight additional
issues in lesson study design.
Catherine Lewis received her doctorate from Stanford University. Fluent in
Japanese, she has researched lesson study since 1993, and has participated
in research lessons at more than 50 Japanese and US schools. Her book
Educating Hearts and Minds:Reflections on Japanese Preschool and Elementary
Education (Cambridge University Press) was named an outstanding academic
book of 1995 by the American Library Association's Choice. Lewis is a
senior research scientist at Mills College in Oakland, California. This
groundbreaking book is available only from Research for Better Schools, and
the low introductory price of $19.99 expires at the end of this year. After
December 31, the price is $24.99. If you believe that teachers should be
the central force in their own professional growth, then read this book to
discover both why and how lesson study matters.
