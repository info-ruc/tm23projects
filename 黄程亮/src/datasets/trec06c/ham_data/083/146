This paper presents a protocol for wireless ad-hoc mobile networks that 
focuses on minimizing power consumption both in data transmission and 
protocol messages.  The new idea driving the protocol is that the maximum 
number of nodes should be used in a transmission to minimize overall used 
power.  It is reactive, in that a "best" route is calculated only when 
some data is to be sent from some node.  The algorithm for route 
discovery is greedy, so that the resulting route is not optimal even in a 
static network. 
The protocol seems to assume that source and destination are within range 
of each other.  Presumably, if this is the case, PARO can be integrated 
with another network layer protocol, but the details of this are never 
described.  More generally, power consumption is rarely the only concern, 
which means PARO would have to combine the power-based cost function with 
other costs, which can get arbitrarily complicated.  Clearly, there are 
also circumstances where total power use for a route is increased by 
relieving a highly stressed node - which is certainly desirable - but 
this is not taken into account by PARO.  Also, in a dynamic network it 
seems that nodes will often have to transmit at full power, destroying 
any advantages the protocol was hoping to offer.
Although the paper's motivation is compelling, power consumption is 
rarely the sole factor in route determination.  Combination with other 
metrics is probably the first extension to be pursued.  However, the 
issues above would have to be addressed before further extensions can be 
profitably pursued.  In a sensor network (or any other that is static) it 
is probably more efficient to use a link-state algorithm, which really 
does calculate optimal routes.  Their comparison to MLSR is not 
convincing as in the long run, when no maintenance is necessary, the 
link-state must clearly win out.
