PARO

This paper introduces PARO, a link-layer technique for reducing power
consumption. Since transmission power increases superlinearly with
range in all propagation models, subdividing a long path may result in
power savings. PARO operates transparently under a standard routing
algorithm (lowest hop count, for instance). If node notices a
conversation between two other nodes, and believes that a route
through it would require less power than the direct transmission
(using some loss model), then it advertises a route through itself.
Self-timing is combined with a use-first-heard scheme to provide
collision avoidance and improved optimality. PARO continues
iteratively, typically improving power consumption as time progresses.

The PARO technique increases latency (increased hop count, not
necessarily visible to the routing algorithm, and also requiring more
time before detecting a network partition). It also provides
suboptimal routes (greediness causes suboptimal selection when two
communicating nodes can hear each other. once a node is selected as an
intermediate node, it always remains an intermediate node until motion
detection algorithm eliminates it; lack of global knowledge induces
suboptimal behavior when the communicating nodes cannot hear each
other, and so the algorithm falls victim to the triangle inequality).

The power equations used in the paper do not take into account fixed
transmission overheads.

** Future work
- PARO always attempts to find a node as close to the bisector of two
  communicating nodes as possible. Once selected, a node will always
  (unless it moves away) redirect traffic between the endpoints. A
  consequence is that additional hops are likely to be used, with
  little improvement in power consumption. More hops are in fact
  likely to increase global power consumption due to second order
  terms ignored by PARO (e.g. receive power).

  Since many more intermediate nodes are likely to have sent out
  redirect advertisements than nodes that actually end up redirecting,
  perhaps remembering the old advertisements would allow intermediate
  nodes to build some idea of the local link state in the system, and
  determine a more optimal route.
