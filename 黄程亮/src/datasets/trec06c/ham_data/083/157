The major contribution of this paper is the PARO protocol.  This
protocol is important because its main goal is to minimize power
consumption.  This is in contrast to prior protocols whose main goal
is minimizing route length and/or convergence time.  So instead of 
trying to find the minimum number of hops between two nodes, PARO tries 
to find the maximum number.

A weakness of this paper is the assumption that all nodes are within
range of each other.  In many real networks this is certainly not the
case.  The authors realize this and say that perhaps PARO is better
suited as a protocol between the link layer and the network layer
instead of being "the" network layer protocol.  Another weakness is
the poorly suited nature of PARO in fairly mobile networks.  This
again, is not a realistic assumption in many cases.

The work in this paper could be expanded upon by combining PARO with a
routing protocol that does not assume that all nodes are within
transmission range of each other.  PARO could be used for local
communications, while the other protocol is used for more wide-range
communication.  I suspect that if the interface to PARO were made
clean enough, it would not be hard to code it into simulations of a
number of different routing protocols.
