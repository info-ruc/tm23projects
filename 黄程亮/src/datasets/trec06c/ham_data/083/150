The paper as its title suggests, gives a routing protocol that optimizes
power consuming. The way by which the protocol achieves this is: By
overhearing the data packets from the source and acknowledgements from the
destination, the intermediate nodes estimate the transmission power needed
when acting as a redirector. By choosing the redirector with the lowest opt,
the optimal 2-hop route is discovered. However, this may not result in the
final optimal route. Iterating this process, the multihop route is
discovered. By setting the alpha, the protocol effectively limits the number
of hops, the increase of which will cause more delay and power consumed for
computing and repeating.
The algorithm seems quite feasible and the simulation results also confirm
this. It may be planted into the wide-area routing protocols to act as a
local optimization.
But it doesn't handle the mobility well. The proactive approach is generally
not as efficient in comm. networks where data are of a bursty nature as
reactive ones. This makes one doubt whether in mobile ad hoc networks,
energy conservation by introducing more hops really works, since more hops
also makes the route more unstable and hence more overload need to update
the route against the modes' mobility.
Also, in reality, the power control levels must be discrete. Is it possible
to take this into consideration in the transmit redirect, say when
calculation the opt?
