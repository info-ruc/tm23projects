Plasma screens are much more rugged, durable and longer lasting.
Unfortunately, the ones I am familiar with are power hogs.

Lee, Starships ae such a power hog, the flat screens could hope to use 
enonugh to be noteworthy.

Russia mulls mothballing space station
Thursday, September 26, 2002 Posted: 2:31 PM EDT (1831 GMT)


MOSCOW (Reuters) -- Manned missions to the international space station may
have to be suspended because Russia cannot afford to build new craft to
carry crews there, a Russian space official said Thursday.

"The situation is desperate," Valery Ryumin, director of the Russian section
of the ISS, said by telephone.

Ryumin, also a top designer for rocket-builder Energiya -- which supplies
the Soyuz craft -- said the company had no money beyond next year to build
the vehicles.

"It takes two years to build the spaceship. Unless we place an order today,
we will have nothing to fly on in 2004," he said.

A key member of the 16-nation space station program, Russia has undertaken
to provide Soyuz capsules.

Designed to carry three people, they remain docked to the orbiting outpost
for months at a time and can be used for emergency rescues. It is intended
for use on a single mission.

Ryumin said that without Soyuz, U.S. crews would not be able to use the
space station as their shuttle craft were designed to remain at the station
for a maximum of three weeks.

The U.S. program also had no alternative provision for rescue missions.

"That is why the issue has been raised of suspending permanent manned
missions at the station," he said.

Ryumin said he had sent a letter to his U.S. counterpart explaining Russia's
concerns. He suggested that the publicity given to Russia's financial
difficulties might prompt the government to stump up more funds.

"Perhaps the government will choose to avoid an international scandal," he
said. "But I will tell you frankly that I have almost given up hope."


Once I knew where I was going, but now I have  forgotten.  Sometimes my mind
wanders.  Sometimes it goes alone, and other times it takes me along...this
isn't one of those times...

Well, I've done some more research now, so I think the answers are resonably
logical.

You're right, Plasma displays are power-hogs... compared to LCDs.  Compared
to CRTs, they use less than half the power however.

I have a suspicion (and that's all it is) that some effieicy could be gained
with plasma screens if they didn't have to convert the mains-source power (a
"mains" supply apready running at the needed 300V or so?).

Looking into their structure, they're more durable physicly, but I suspect
also in vacuum.  LCDs are thin and contain a liquid, which would be leached
out in any (hopefully expected) vacuum exposure, whereas plasmas only
containa  low-pressure gas, making it less likely to leak or fracture from
internal pressure.  They could be used easily in and out of vacuum (EG: and
V-exposed ship-lab, or in an airlock?).

It would make more of a demand on a ships power, but it can be lessened by
simply having inactive terminals shut down.

The stats I've found for their lifespan also seem impressive:

<quote>
This varies considerably between manufacturers but usually from 20,000 to
30,000 hours. After this time the plasma screen will only be at around half
the original brightness. If you used your plasma screen for 5 hours a day
every day it would last over 10 years.

At the end of the plasma screen's life, the screen will be very dull and you
will need to replace the plasma screen with a new one. This is one advantage
plasma screens have over LCD projectors, which have a bulb life of usually
2,000 hours before replacement.
</quote>

Another source said:
<q>
Manufacturers quote a life expectancy of around 24,000 continual hours use
before noticeable deterioration of the picture quality becomes apparent. It
will probably last much longer depending on the application of your screen.
Eight hours per day, seven days per week for eight years is less than 24,000
hours!
</q>

Even being used 24hours a day, that still nearly 3 years of solid use before
they loose half their brightness.  with power-saving modes saving of screen
life and power, a ship would probably only need a complete screen refit
every 10 years?
I'd imagine it's the phosper in the screen that decays, leading to the
screens death.  Anyone know if there's a way to revitalise phosphers?  Even
if not, I'd guess most of the screens could be reused if the phosphers could
be replaced?

Baring new developments in flat-screens, I think Plas,a screens fit the bill
nicely. =)

All the best,

Sci
