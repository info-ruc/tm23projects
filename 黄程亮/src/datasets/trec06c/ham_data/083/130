Dear  Sir,
 
I am Dr. Sanusi Abiola, the personal Assistance to the late Nigerian Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of the Federal Chief Bola Ige, who was murdered on 23rd of December 2001 by unknown persons. 
 
Before he became the minister of Justice and the Attorney General of the Federation, he was once the Minister of Mines and Power. During his time as a  Minister of Mines and Power, the Federal Government of Nigeria gave to his ministry the sum of US$200 Million, which is to be used for the completion of the Ajaokuta Steel Industry and the
purchasing of electrical transformers and able for the Nigerian Electric Power Authority (NEPA). Then this jobs and the supply of the
transformers and cables were done, but of low Quality standard and the transformers he imported were of low quality standard and of low power capacity. 
 
Because of the low quality standard of this jobs, the sum of US$22 Million was realized of which he deposited US$15 Million to a security  company abroad and was looking for a reliable person or company whom he will transact business with before he meet his un-timely death on the 23rd of December, 2001. He informed the security company about his foreign partner who will be coming to pick the money although no company's name was given to the security company before he died it was only I and the late Chief Bola Ige knows about the money. 
 
Therefore, if you can be trusted in fairness to your honesty to safe keep that money pending when I will be coming to meet you in your country. Please, if you  are not interested with this business,kindly inform me As soon as you received this proposals. At the same time, if you are interested, kindly send me as a  matter of urgency,your company's name and address, your private phone and fax number. 

This will be used to send to you the fund deposit certificate which you will use to claim the money from the Security company. 
 
I am awaiting to hear from you. 
 
Best regard. 
 
Dr. Sanusi Abiola.
