CEDAR : A Core-Extraction distributed ad-hoc routing algorithm


This paper presents a routing algorithm called Core-Extraction Distributed 
Ad hoc Routing (CEDAR), which supports QoS routing in ad hoc network 
environments.

The main goal of CEDAR is to provide routes that are highly likely to 
satisfy the bandwidth requirement. CEDAR establishes a core of the network, 
then propagates the link state to the nodes of the core. Route is computed 
on-demand at core nodes using only the local information.

The core is an approximation of a minimum dominating set of the under-lying 
network i.e., every node is either a core node or has a link
to a core node.  Periodic updates by each node carrying the number of 
neighbors and the number of nodes for which it is a core, helps to
maintain this dominating set.  The efficiency of this method (how close to 
the minimum dominating set it actually gets) however is not
evaluated.  The set of core nodes are then expected to maintain virtual 
links (of length atmost 3) among the neighbors in the core graph.
Broadcast of rotue requests to the core-neighbors is done by unicasting 
through the virtual links and caching RTS/CTS information inorder to make 
broadcast efficient.  However the RTS/CTS is a scheme usually implemented 
in hardware and to change a hardware implementation is not a very easy task.

To incorporate the BW guarantee into establishing a path between a source 
(S) and a destination (D), the paper proposes the use of two
signaling packets, ito and dto. Each constituent node under a core node's 
charge is responsible for monitoring the link BWs with its neighbors, and 
periodically reports this information to the core node via either ito 
(detecting an increase in BW) or dto (detecting a decrease in BW). This 
information is useful in assisting the core nodes to identify a suitable 
route that meets the BW requirement of a data transmssion. The ito-queue 
and dto-queue located in a core node are flushed in a way that ensures that 
the news of decreasing BW propogates much faster than the news of 
increasing BWs.


Comments:

One of its strengths is the scalability. Localizing the exchange of 
link-state information within the core node's coverage allows a new node 
moving in and out of this coverage to freely associate with and dissociate 
from the core node. Because each core node only possesses the knowledge of 
its constituents' link-state information, BW is conserved.

The simulations were weak. They postulate that CEDAR can handle tens to 
hundreds of nodes, but then proceed to evaluate with 6 nodes. Later, they 
move to some simulation model [30nodes], but not much details are provided 
on the real model behind the simulation.

The algorithm also assumes bidirectional links.

The algorithms are not power-aware. core nodes' batteries would be quickly 
depleted. Besides, the core nodes get overburdened with packets, and the 
QoS would slide down.
