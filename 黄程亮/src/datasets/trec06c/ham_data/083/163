PARO

PARO (Power Aware Routing Optimization) is an algorithm designed to reduce
the overll system power consumed in the process of routing.  On the simplest
level, PARO acts to insert an additional routing hop between two existing
hops whenever the central node detects that there is a net power savings in
doing so.  The basic protocol operation is as follows.  Each packets, in its
transmission, includes the transmit power necessary for that node to reach
the destination.  Whenever a node overhears a packet, it checks the node's
transmit power relative to the total power incurred by inserting the 
snooping
node into the routing path.  If the snooping node can provide a sufficient
power savings in the route, and no other nearby node transmits a better
route first, the overhearing node will transmit a redirect packet,
instructing the sending node to route future traffic through the 
intermediate
node.  Only one node may be added into a route on any one iteration of the
protocol.  Extending PARO to mobile network is explained through the 
addition
of a linear "silence interval" term to the transmission power, as well as a
mechanism for upstream nodes to detect when a previous node is no longer the
power-optimal route.

PARO has some nice features.  One of the most significant is that most 
of the
power savings observed come from adding the first one to two nodes into the
path.  This suggests that moderate increases in delay can significantly 
reduce
overall power consumption, and that while convergence may be a slow process,
there is sufficient power savings from partial convergence to justify the
effort.  In fact, the decreasing rate of return for additional nodes 
suggests
that there is a reasonable trade-off to be found between latency and power
consumption.

The paper also had a number of weaknesses.  One of the more significant 
issues
to me is the simulation results, and their method of presentation.  
Presenting
in graph form (instead of, say, a bar graph) really requires more than three
data points to give a useful picture of the tradeoffs involved.  The
adaptation of PARO to mobile systems is also fairly scant, and seems highly
likely to suffer from a number of problems with respect to genuine node and
link failures.  The authors describe a node hand-off mechanism for removing
a hop that is no longer power efficient, but give no consideration to the
effects of the loss of a reflector node (or reflector link), and how such
losses will interact with routing protocols used in conjunction with PARO.
Finally, implementation of this protocol requires nodes to listen in on all
communications traffic, which implies running the network interface in
promiscious mode, increasing NIC power consumption.

One recommendation I would make is to more closely examine the effects of
quantized transmission power on performance.  Both the research on how to
maximize power efficiency given a set of power levels, and the research on
how to select the optimal transmission power levels for power aware routing
would be useful information, and could have a real impact on protocol design
and performance.
