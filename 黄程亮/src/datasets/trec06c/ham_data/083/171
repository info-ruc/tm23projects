In this paper a new energy efficient protocol for mobile ad-hoc networks is 
introduced. The paper assumes a network in which all nodes are within 
transmission range of every other node (i.e. a small, clustered network is 
ideal for PARO). The critical assumption the protocol is based on is that 
the less distance between communicating nodes, the less powerful the 
transmission, and hence the more power is conserved. The protocol, which is 
quite simple, includes three main processes: overhearing, redirecting and 
route-maintenance. Overhearing is the process through which nodes include 
themselves into routes between source and destination nodes. After the 
destination node sends a communication transmission to the source node, 
those nodes that overhear this transmission will be viable intermediary 
nodes for the route. This intermediary or "redirector" node assesses, 
through a mathematical equation included in the paper, if its participation 
in the route will make a more energy efficient route. Then, if it is 
possible to have a more energy efficient route, this redirector node sends 
a redirect message to both nodes and becomes an intermediary node in the 
route, which will forward packets from source to destination. This process 
is known as redirecting. Overhearing and redirecting are iterative 
processes and continue until no intermediary node exists which thinks it 
can create a more efficient route (i.e .route convergence). The final 
process is route maintenance, which is critical to preserving the existence 
of the routes while little traffic is being transmitted. This is done by 
sending periodic data signals from source to destination keeping the route 
active.

The authors include a pretty comprehensive simulation (one of the best seen 
thus far). Many of the concerns that I had while reading the paper were 
answered by the simulation's results. For instance, I felt that PARO would 
show a substantial decrease in the success rate of data transmissions in an 
actively mobile network since this would entail an increase in the number 
of iterations seen in the network, which I felt would cause diminishing 
results as far as energy conservation was concerned. However, it seems that 
this was not the case since route-maintenance was more efficient than was 
previously assumed.

One question, which was raised in the beginning of the paper which was not 
addressed in the simulation was the idea of having varying packet sizes 
being transmitted (they used 100-byte packets). It would seem that larger 
data packets would need greater transmission power. So, in addition, to 
distance between nodes, the effect of packet sizes on energy efficiency 
should be addressed. Another problem with this protocol that you see with 
the examples provided is that nodes in the "middle of the network" will 
always be active and nodes on the fringe of the network will be conserving 
the greatest amount of energy. This might have diminishing returns in a 
more static topology with large amounts of data transfer since "middle 
nodes" would lose a substantial amount of energy being redirector nodes 
rather than losing energy communicating as source nodes. They are in a 
pretty unfortunate position in the network and this may hurt them in the 
long run when they need to communicate.
