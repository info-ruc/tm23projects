PERSONAL AND STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL


DEAR N. Christopher Phillips,

1 am Mrs. FATOU NSAKKA Ivorien widow with an only son
DANIEL NSAKKA. My husband was the chief security
officer to the ousted President Henry BEDIE of Cote
d'voire.During the over throw of 24th December 1999,
my husband was among the people that were killed by the
military. 

Since after his death, I ran away with my only son, I
do hereby wish to ask for your assistance in urgent
business transaction that requires absolute honesty
and secrecy. Although I did not in any way disclose to
my friend the details of this my proposal due to
confidential nature of this transaction. By virtue of
my husband's position. The former President(BEDIE)gave
him US 20.000.000.00 Dollars(Twenty million US
dollars) cash in US100.00 dollars bill stacked in a
box when he got information that the militaries were
planning to over throw him. Immediately my husband was
confirmed dead, I made away with this box with my only
son so that we can not be reached by Mr BEDIE. I have
really been waiting for a more suitable time and
opportunity to contact you concerning this 
transaction. Right now,the money is in a safe place, I
deposited it with a security company for safe keeping.


I am using this opportunity to seek for your 
assistance to move this money to your country, to be
invested on behalf of my only son. For this business
to be concluded immediately, all you need to do is to
arrange to meet with me and my son where this box is
been lodged, open an account in your name, pay in the
whole money after clearing and transferring it to your
chosen account. We can't do that on our own because
we don't have account else where, moreover, we don't
have any business to cover-up that is why we needed
your assistance. 

I am ready to offer you 30% of the total sum and give
you the full power to manage the remaining 70% on
behalf of my son. Contact my son DANIEL NSAKKA where
we are currently staying in a sister's house in
LOME-TOGO. This money we deposited it in the best
security company in LOME-TOGO. Upon conclusion of
arrangement, we shall forward to you the certificate
of deposit, and the phone and fax number of the
security company for confirmation immediately you 
receive this e-mail message or contact me through this

TELEHPONE NUMBER:00228 913 17 83.
Please I want us to finish this business as quickly as
possible. 

Yours faithfully,

FATOU NSAKKA.
