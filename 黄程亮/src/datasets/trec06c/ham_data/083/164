Conserving Transmission Power in wireless Ad Hoc 
Networks

This paper addressed the one of most important and 
scarce resource for MANET i.e battery power. It 
considers conserving power in manet's as one of the 
most important part in optimizing the performance of 
manet's. Power aware routing optimization (PARO) 
assumes that transmitting a packet to a distant node 
consumes significantly more power than to one that is 
near. Hence PARO attempts to minimize power usage by a 
node by increasing the number of intermediate nodes 
that are near to it. It makes use of reactive routing 
algorith in order to establish the least power 
consuming route between a source and a destination. 
Routes are created and maintained whenever there is a 
demand and hence there are no signal messages.

The major weakness of PARO is that it assumes that all 
the nodes are within hearing range of each other so any 
node can reach any other node in a single hop as in a 
LAN. This assumption limits the scalability of PARO to 
a great extent as the network would be confined to a 
very small range of distance. The author do describes 
communication between LAN's as a WAN but the protocol 
is not clear and is not described in detail. The paper 
gives simulation analysis of the protocol. From 
analysis it is clear that PARO would perform well in 
smaller networks with limited mobility. The comparison 
of PARO with the modified Link State routing algorithm 
MLSR does not give a better idea of the effectivity of 
the algorithm. As MLSR is a proactive algorithm with 
lots of signalling messges. It would have been better 
if the authors would have compared PARO with other 
reactive algorithms which have some power optimization.

Future work could be directed towards a more scalable 
network using PARO. Also other general issues like 
routing loops, load balancing, security issues, higher 
layer protocols can be discussed.
