CEDAR seeks to be an algorithm which will allow Quality of Service
paths to be quickly discovered and maintained in the network, so that
those nodes which need good paths can find and use them, and that the
low-bandwidth paths will not be overused.  Because of this goal, QoS
is the main metric they consider in the paper. They are also setting
up a unique core structure which routes packets for all the non-core
nodes in their neighborhood.  In contrast to some other papers that we
have read, I find this paper to be clearly laid out and well-written;
I understood quickly and easily most of their points.

One point, however, was the complaint about broadcasts: "broadcasts
are highly unreliable in ad-hoc networks", which is based on the
authors' experience, and is mainly a complaint about the
hidden-terminal problem.  I agree to a certain extent, but would not
that in the wireless medium, even unicasts are broadcast, and so you
avoid flooding, at least, but not some inherent hidden-terminal
issues.  Furthermore, you will not be able to avoid some level of
local broadcast to establish the initial topology of the network, as
is noted in the paper (they claim that you can use any of the standard
routing protocols for the core, all of which use some sort of
broadcast, and try to avoid the hidden terminal problem in other
ways). 

Another concern of mine is that the approximation algorithm that they
are using to get the MDS of the graph is not proven, in this paper, at
least (it might be well know to have this property), to get near the
MDS for some definition of near, but is rather simply claimed to do
so.  Given that their QoS routing depends for its quality on having a
good approximation to the MDS, I would have thought it important to
address the approximation very carefully.

There are at least two parameters which I would also like to see
addressed in greater detail.  The first is the speed at which the
increase waves propagate through the network.  It seems to me that the
choice of this value will greatly determine the stability of the
route calculations.  The second is the function used to calculate the
ttl sent out for a given link.  It is likely that the naive choice of
linearity in the available bandwidth is not the optimal choice.

Further work could look at these parameters in CEDAR and try to
discover how their choice affects the performance and availability of
high-bandwidth links.  Two other quick points to examine: what happens
in very sparse graphs where every node is in the core?  Should there
be some way to determine that the graph is wonky? ie. what if there
are no particularly high-bandwidth links, and everything is fairly
bad?  There ought to be a way to detect that CEDAR is not going to buy
us much and drop to a simpler protocol.
