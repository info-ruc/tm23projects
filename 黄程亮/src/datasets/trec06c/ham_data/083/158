Conserving Transmission Power in Wireless Ad Hoc 
Networks

Previous papers did not consider the need for power 
conserving algorithms in their routing protocols.  
This paper proposes a power-aware routing 
optimization, PARO.  It focuses on minimizing overall 
power consumption in an ad-hoc network by maximizing 
the number of nodes used during transmission.  This is 
achieved by allowing an intermediate node to overhear 
transmission between source and destination nodes.  If 
the intermediate node thinks by its calculation a 
route through itself will conserve power, it elects to 
forward the packet from the source to the 
destination.  There can be several intermediate nodes 
between source and destination.  This optimization 
takes advantage of the ability to adjust power 
transmission levels.

This paper assumes that source and destination nodes 
are within range of each other.  This is very flawed.  
In introducing more nodes between source and 
destination, it is more likely that packets will be 
lost, but these were not considered.  Since their 
algorithm requires several iterations to converge 
toward a final route, this might take incredibly long 
or if the network is very dense, convergence may never 
be reached.  Their algorithm also focuses on 
transmission power only and neglects the cost of 
processing overhead packets and the cost of keeping 
the nodes in a listening mode.  Their simulations did 
not consider a mobile network and therefore did not 
lend credence to their claims of better performance.

To build on the research, PARO needs to be implemented 
in a real network to evaluate the convergence rate and 
comparisons made with other protocols apart from MLSR
