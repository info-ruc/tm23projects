Subject: Fall Course Packets at The Copy Shop

A new year is rapidly approaching and we at The Copy Shop would like to
remind the professors who use our packet production services that it is time
to begin the copyright permissions process for Course Packets.  For those
instructors who are new to the University, or are planning their first
course packet, we offer a hassle-free alternative to the University=B9s syst=
em
for producing course readers.  We assure that permissions are obtained on
all copyright articles and provide fast and inexpensive printing as well as
several binding options for your packet.  Just follow the easy steps below
to begin processing your course packet with us.

1. Put together a bibliography of your reader.  Include Book/Journal Title,
Author/Editor, Article/Chapter Title, Publishing Company, Year Published,
ISBN number, and page numbers.
2. FAX, e-mail, or deliver a copy of your bibliography to; The Copy Shop,
539 E 13th Ave, Eugene, OR 97401, (541)485-6253 or thecopyshop@qwest.net.
3. Bring in your originals and we will make master copies to produce each
course packet from.  No need for you to spend hours standing over the
copiers!
4. When permissions have been obtained, we will contact you with a total cos=
t
in copyright fees and let you decide if there are articles you wish to
remove or not.  We will not begin productions until you have given us the
final ok to do so.

Some articles may be denied.  This usually occurs when the source is from an
anthology it was not originally published in, or when the publishing company
no longer holds the rights.  We will notify you by e-mail or phone when ther=
e
are difficulties obtaining permission.  Also, the earlier we can begin
obtaining copyright permissions the more likely we can include all the
articles you wish to have in your packet.  Some publishing companies can
take up to three months to respond to our requests, though most respond
within two to three weeks.  If you have any questions regarding our
services, do not hesitate to call or drop in.  We look forward to another
exciting term!

Please let me know if I can answer any questions.
