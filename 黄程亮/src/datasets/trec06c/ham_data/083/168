>Power-aware routing optimization (PARO)
>
>A power-aware routing protocol which tries to minimize the transmission power
>requirements in a mobile adhoc network has been proposed in this paper.
>Intermediate nodes (called redirectors) choose to forward packets on behalf of
>source destination pairs to reduce the power requirements for transmission of
>packets. This optimization works in case when the destination is within range
>of the source. In case of wide-area networks, local-energy saving coupled with
>wide-area routing is used to forward packets when source and destination are
>not within transmission range of each other.
>Some important assumptions are: Radios can dynamically adjust their
>transmission power levels. Also, transmission power required to send a packet
>from node A to node B is almost the same as that required to send the same
>packet from node B to node A. Transmission is much more power consuming than
>reception or listening (and hence optimize on transmission power.)
>Protocol tries to maximize the number of redirectors on the path from source to
>destination to minimize power requirements (unlike traditional algorithms which
>try to minimize the number of hops required.) Routes are discovered on-demand
>(reactive). Every node adds the power level used to transmit the packet to
>the packet header. Any node which overhears the transmission then takes note of
>the power level used and based on the reception level calculates the power
>required to reach the transmitting node.
>Basic algorithm: At first, source directly communicates with the destination
>(say, by sending the transmission at maximum power level). Some node which
>overhears this transmission will calculate if it could reduce the power
>requirements if it acts as a redirector. If so, it will inform the source and
>the destination that it will act as a redirector using a route-redirect message
>(and adds appropriate entries in the redirect table). Nodes which can further
>optimize the power requirements will add on as redirectors.
>There is also the route maintenance part where the routes are adapted to the
>changing topology. This is done using some small enhancements to the
>overhearing and redirecting part. Transmission level to the next redirector
>is now sum of old estimate and delta where delta depends on the average speed
>of the nodes in the network and the time since the next redirector was
>overheard. If a node does not transmit any packets to any destination for
>route-timeout period it proactively sends route maintenance packets.
>Also, other nodes in the network can overhear transmissions to redirector nodes
>and if any of these move the new nodes can elect to act as redirectors if that
>helps.
>Preliminary performance evaluation results are presented which validate the
>protocol
>
>Pros:
>A power-aware reactive routing protocol has been proposed in this paper.
>Initial simulation/experimental results show the efficacy of the protocol.
>This protocol works in differenct communication environments like sensor n/ws,
>home n/ws, MANETs.
>
>Cons:
>Simplitic assumptions like  transmission power required to send a packet
>from node A to node B is almost the same as that required to send the same
>packet from node B to node A.
>No thorough evaluation of the work.
>This is a local optimization. Not clear if this works well in a larger network.
>
>Future directions:
>-More thorough evaluation of the protocol especially is large networks.
>-Testing performance of different applications running on PARO.
>-Saving reception and listening power inaddition to transmission power.
