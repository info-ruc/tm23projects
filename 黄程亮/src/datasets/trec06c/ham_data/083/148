PARO (Power-aware routing optimization) was introduced in this paper.  The 
creators of PARO looked at ad-hoc networks in a different way then we have 
in the previous papers.  In general, it considers the optimal path route 
from node A to node B to be the route that requires the least amount of 
transmission power.  This is good because in general, nodes in ad-hoc wants 
to save battery power, and the less power spent sending packets means more 
power for longer life or for other tasks.

PARO has two main assumptions: the device used to transmit packets has an 
interface to control the transmission power, and that nodes can listen to 
packets (not intended for it) and gather information from those 
packets.   The general idea is that if A has a route to B, it tries to send 
a message to B.  If a node C in between A and B hears that message, it 
calculates whether or not it can overall transmitting power if it is used 
as a redirect node.  If so, it sends a message to A telling A to redirect 
all packets to B through C.  The calculation of transmission power is based 
on signal strength of a packet received.  In a mobile network, because 
nodes can be moving, the signal strength may vary from packet to 
packet.  Therefore the calculation of the minimal transmission power is 
crucial.  If chosen too low, the packet may not reach any node.

I find it sort of ironic that for the PARO to work efficiently and 
accurately, it needs packets to be sent in the network so information about 
transmission can be gathered.  I can see why this algorithm might work for 
a static network, but i still need some convincing for ad-hoc 
networks.  For the ad-hoc network, it just seems like the deltas and 
approximations in the algorithms are just increased to account for network 
movement and therefore maybe not even saving power.  I don't think the 
example described in figure 4 of the paper, is entirely correct.  If B was 
indeed a redirect node, A would only be using enough power to send packets 
to B, and therefore C shouldn't be able to hear what A is sending.   Also 
PARO is based on too many assumptions.

More work has to be done with choosing the correct parameters and 
simulations in the real world have to be done.  In general, can an 
algorithm that relies on configuration parameters (which depend on network 
environment) be successful in an ad-hoc network?  I ask this because the 
general nature of ad-hoc networks is that the environment is unpredictable 
and optimal parameters might have to be set on the fly dependent on network 
characteristic.  Also, by just considering power, how much cost in 
performance will it give up?  The importance of saving power and trade offs 
has to be looked at more closely.
