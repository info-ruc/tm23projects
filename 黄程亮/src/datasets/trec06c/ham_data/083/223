CEDER is an algorithm for QoS routing in an ad-hoc network.  The main goal 
of CEDER is to compute unicast routes that satisfy the bandwidth 
requirements with a high probability.   An approximation of the minimum 
dominating connecting set of host in the network (known as the core) 
performs all the route computation and state propagation.   The core, which 
is established via local elections in constant time, provides a mean to 
dynamically create and maintain routes efficiently with very little 
overheard.  This is due to the fact that each node in the core is only 
concerned about local state for route computations.
As usual, it is assumed that all links in the network are 
bidirectional.  It is also assumed that the MAC and routing layer are 
closely coordinated and the two layers can estimate the available bandwidth 
and the source host can compute the minimum bandwidth needed to communicate 
to its destination.   It was mentioned in the paper that optimality of 
routes are sacrificed for the ability to efficiently compute good 
routes.  It would be more efficient for nodes to communicate directly with 
their neighbors instead of via their dominator.  It is even more 
inefficient if two neighboring nodes happen to have different 
dominators.  Also, any node u must periodically broadcast a beacon to aid 
in core computation and maintenance.  These periodic decreases the 
available bandwidth significantly while also making contention and 
collision a much greater risk.
