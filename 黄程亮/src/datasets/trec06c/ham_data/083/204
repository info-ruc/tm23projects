Hey Jerry,

We had a report that grv2 was running an IRC server.  After looking into it
I found that there were several ports open on that machine and it looked
likes that machine has been compromised.  They are running SSH on port 16236
for example.   I've included, at the bottom, some of what I've found on that
machine.  The short of is that I had to disable the network port for that
computer.  I would like to come over tomorrow and take a look at it and see
what we find.  How critical is that machine?  How long can you have that
machine down?  Most likely you all will have to reinstall the OS.  I would
also like to bring over a new person, Sasko Stefanovski, with me.  He is the
new IS person who was hired to help faculty/staff with some of the burden of
administrating their servers.  

Thanks,

Tim
