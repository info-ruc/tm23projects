	The paper "Conserving Power in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks" introduces power 
conservation as a design goal for ad-hoc networks.  The paper evaluates 
ad-hoc networks in situations where transmission power is the overwhelming 
power cost and assumes the nodes goal is to reduce their collective power 
usage during transmission.  The paper proposes that the optimal routing 
solution, when quantified in terms of power usage is not the shortest hop 
solution, and that it is more optimal to transmit via a route involving 
multiple hops with nodes operating at less then maximum power.  This is 
based on the premise that power usage climbs disproportionately to the gain 
in range.
	The protocol Power aware routing optimization(PARO) can be either 
implemented as the routing layer or just below the routing layer inserted 
at layer 2.5 to provide power efficiency benefits to existing MANET 
protocols.  The optimization has three phases, overhearing, computing 
redirection and route convergence.  The protocol begins by transmitting 
directly from point A to point B, and includes in the packet the power 
usage.  Other nodes overhear the packet and compute if they could offer a 
route using less power.  If such a route exists they inform the source and 
destination, and the next packet sent over the route will use less 
power.  The protocol then converges to its optimal solution iteratively as 
other nodes may now eavesdrop and insert themselves into these two 
hops.   The protocol converges as a function of the packets sent by the 
application specific layer above.
	The authors implemented PARO using commercial 802.11b technology and 
showed that despite implementation limits of the Aironet cards limiting 
them to fixed number of power levels they were able to achieve significant 
aggregate power savings.
