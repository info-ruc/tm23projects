This paper designs a routing protocol motivated by a need to conserve 
power rather than minimize delay and bandwidth. The basic idea revolves 
around an eavesdropping node, call it R, listening to a conversation 
between S and T. If R calculates that it could lower the power 
consumption required in this travel by acting as an intermediate host 
(i.e. the total power cost from S to R to T is less than that directly 
from S to T) then R sends a packet to both S and T alerting them of R's 
candidacy as a forwarding host. S will now send packets to T's IP 
address, but with R's MAC address. All the nodes involved will of 
course have to maintain routing information for this route.

This paper is notable because it is the first paper we have read that 
attempts to form a routing protocol with the goal of minimizing power 
consumption rather than, say, hopcount. They attempt to do extensive 
profiling of their performance which is laudable and characterize under 
what conditions the algorithm works best (packets send very rapidly or 
nodes remain mostly still). However, ultimately this algorithm is a 
simple idea which falls apart in a complex world. Their assumptions are 
unreasonable. The notion that all communicating nodes are within 
maximum transmission distance of each other, for example, is pretty 
unusual (it also breaks their redirecting technique). In none of their 
simulations do they provide the reader with bandwidth calculation (I 
would even settle for a 'goodput' measure), and their comparison to 
MLSR is done on static nodes, whereas the focus of the paper is on 
mobile hosts. They mention themselves that the route constructed by 
this algorithm may be sub-optimal.

What this paper truly needs is a smaller scope. As it stands it is 
pretty poor routing algorithm. It's real use would be as a modification 
upon existing protocols--The notion of eavesdroppers nominating 
themselves as a more power efficient route could easily be imagined as 
a plugin to other protocols like AODV. It would be interesting to see, 
say, a comparison of the bandwidth, latency, and power consumption of 
AODV vs. the same metrics on AODV+PARO.
