Dr. Gilfoyle,

What is your feedback from the new version of gcc and gdb.
Have you experienced any problem?

Beside administering the beowulf cluster, you said that I'll administer some
scientific workstations too, and the old cluster also. 
Could you send me a list with the names of these workstations, and some
account info, so I would be able to login and check/update them
periodically.

Sasko

Hi Sashak,

   Attached is an email from Luminita Tudor with the details on
the compiler upgrade. If you could upgrade them as described in 
her email, we would appreciate it. Let me know when you make the
change in case we run into any problems with the new compilers.

cheers,

jerry
