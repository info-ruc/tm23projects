The motivation that worked behind developing a power-aware routing optimization (PARO) is
the significance of conserving power in mobile ad hoc networks. As the paper points out,
power resources is one of the most scarce resources in present day wireless networks. PARO
attempts to minimize usage of power by reducing transmission power when packets are
exchanged between nodes. And it does so, by increasing the number of intermediate nodes that
the packet has to go through to reach its destination. This is in stark contrast to what
most other routing protocols try to achieve (in other words, difference in the definition of
optimality). PARO uses a reactive routing algorithm to establish the least power consuming
route between a source and a destination. Routes are created and maintained in a strictly
on-demand basis as any unnecessary transmission would defeat the purpose of the
optimization.

One of the biggest weaknesses of PARO is the assumption that both the source and the
destination are within hearing range of each other. This raises serious questions about
PARO's performance in large settings, and also the objective of the protocol itself. The
authors could perhaps have addressed this issue in a more detailed fashion. The paper also
offers an analysis of performance of the protocol in a simulated environment. From the
results, it becomes rather evident that PARO would perform reasonably well in smaller
networks but with not too much mobility. In fact, figure 6 in the paper is strongly
indicative of its average performance in a highly dynamic environment. The comparison
between PARO and MLSR also seemed like a cheap shot to convince the reader about PARO's
effectiveness. MLSR, by virtue of being a proactive routing protocol, always has more packet
transmission than PARO. A more realistic comparison with an efficient reactive protocol
could serve the purpose better.

Future enhancements should definitely include the scalability issue that the current version
overlooks. Also, factors like load balancing, route-loops should be looked into. A better
algorithm for reducing convergence time could also be developed. This would be particularly
helpful in ameliorating PARO's performance in mobile wireless networks.
