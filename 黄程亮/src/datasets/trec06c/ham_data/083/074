Dr. Gilfoyle,
I just started building the compiler.
BTW after I finish with the compoiler and the debbuger, I want to update the
version of ssh.
You have installed openssh-2.9p2-1, which is way to old. 
Sasko

Hi Sashak,

   Attached is an email from Luminita Tudor with the details on
the compiler upgrade. If you could upgrade them as described in 
her email, we would appreciate it. Let me know when you make the
change in case we run into any problems with the new compilers.

cheers,

jerry
