hi bob,

   do you have any extra tapes for a DDS 3 tape drive (like the
one on grv2)? we used to have bunches of those things, but i 
can't find them now. lots of stuff got moved in february when 
the cluster lab was built. how much can we fit on a single
DDS 3 tape? i seem to remember something like 2 GByte.

thanks-in-advance,

jerry
