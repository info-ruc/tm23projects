The paper "CEDAR: a Core-Extraction Distributed Ad Hoc Routing algorithm" 
introduces a new paradigm of Quality of Service(bandwidth) in evaluating 
wireless area networks.  CEDAR defines the optimal route to be 
shortest-widest-path, while introducing new goals for QoS in wireless ad 
hoc networks: First, all connections must specify required bandwidth. 
Second, state propagation(specifically available bandwidth) must be kept to 
a minimum,  high bandwidth link information needs to propagate quickly, low 
bandwidth does not. Finally, routes most converge towards optimal routes 
over time, but simplicity and robustness of the algorithm and 
implementation is more desired then most optimal route.
	CEDAR establishes the concept of a core-nodes that engage in route 
discovery and link-state maintenance in order to minimize the overhead and 
redundancy of involving all nodes.  By choosing a dominating set of nodes, 
CEDAR provides quick access to the routing information for all nodes and 
reduces local broadcasts.
	CEDAR develops the concept of QoS by effectively describing the stability 
and bandwidth of links.  CEDAR uses a slow-moving increase bandwidth wave 
and a faster-moving decrease-bandwidth wave.  For un-stable links that go 
up and down often the faster moving wave dominates, and reports 
low-bandwidth.  Stable links slowly increase in bandwidth.  This concept 
uses the motion of waves to effectively compute the temporal and capacity 
properties of the links.
	CEDAR divides routing into 3 components: route establishment, establishing 
stable route through the core, and re-establishing of failures after 
topology changes.  CEDAR could easily be implemented using the any of the 
previously discussed routing algorithms on-top of the CEDAR layer gathering 
bandwidth data, but the authors have chosen to implement their own.
	CEDAR, unlike most papers to date, does include both a performance 
evaluation on real hardware and a simulation.  The evaluation is quire 
in-depth but does not provide a base of comparison with algorithms it 
previously cited.  The hw implementation used wireless infared-technology 
which has widely different properties the 802.11b which has been used in 
previous papers.
