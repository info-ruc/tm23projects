GCC-3.0.4 is installed under /usr/local.
The old gcc has not been deleted. 
To use the new one, please add the /usr/local/bin in your PATH environment
variable before
/usr/bin. Additionally you might need to specify -L/usr/local/lib to link
against the new libraries.

If you do not have problem with the new gcc, we could wipe-off the old one,
and install GCC-3.0.4 under /usr, but this is not necessary step.

Great let me know when gcc.3.0.4 is read. I will then 
try to update the CLAS software on the Linux cluster here.
I don't need to be physically here to do it. So just e-mail me.
