This paper introduces PARO, an on-demand adhoc routing protocol, which purpose
is qutie different from other MANET routing protocols. PARO tries to minimize power
consumed by packet transmisssion including route discovery. It is accomplished by 
adding as more nodes as possible to a route, if the new route is more energy efficient
than the old one. It assumes that each node can dynamically adjust its transmission
power and compute the minimal power required to commuincate with any of its neighbors. 
The main observation of the paper is that to route a packet over multiple short hops is usually 
cheaper than over fewer long distance hops, given the energy model for
ad-hoc networks. 

There are three core components of PARO: overhearing, redirecting and 
route maintenance. A node keeps overhearing packets and compute the exact 
power to communicate with its neighbors. An internal nodes may volunteer to 
redirect packets between two nodes if it finds out that the total energy consumption 
can be reduced. In case of node mobility and failures, explicit signaling packets 
may be used for the maintenance purpose, and routes may be updated to reflect
topology changes. 

PARO addresses a significant issue in adhoc network routing, but it still has 
some weaknesses. First, it assumes a fairly simple transmission and energy
model. It dose not take the power consumption during reception and listening 
modes into account. The assumption that all nodes are located with the 
maximum transmission range of each other is not reasonable in practice. 
Second, a route with more hops could introduce longer delay and become less
reliable. Finally, the route maintenance algorithm is very expensive and complex, which 
may have extra overhead to the whole network.
