Conserving Transmission Power in wireless Ad Hoc Networks

This paper introduces PARO, a power-aware routing optimization that results 
in the reduction in power expended in transmissions from a source to 
destination among ad hoc networks. Developing efficient architectures and 
protocols that increase the operational lifetime of network enabled 
services. PARO uses a packet forwarding technique where intermediate nodes 
can elect to be "re-directors" between a source destination pair with the 
goal of reducing the transmission power required. PARO is a node-to-node 
based routing technique, thus geting rid of the inefficiencies of having to 
send out too many signalling packets as in a broadcast flooding technique.

Efficient routes are discovered using data packets itself, other than using 
signalling packets. In this protocol, every nodes updates its packet header 
to indicate the power required to transmit the packet. Any node which 
overhears both source and destination can compute whether packet forwarding 
can result in power savings. If an intermediate node elects to become a 
re-director it sends a route-redirect message to source and destination 
informing them of the new node. If a node does not have information on 
power requirements to the destination, it just sends it out with the 
maximum power. Every node maintains a overhear cache where it stores the 
triple(ID, time, Power) required for each destination. In dense networks, 
multiple redirect messages could be generated, in which case the redirect 
request with the best power optimization is chosen. PARO deals with the 
mobility of nodes by transmitting at a power level slightly greater than 
the recorded value to increase the probability of reaching the next hop on 
the first attempt.

The authors also present an evaluation of the protocol proving the fact it 
results in power reduction when there are sufficient number of 
re-directors. But these simulations also reveals much of the drawbacks of 
the protocol. Having more than three re-directors does not result in more 
saving of power and only results in creating a longer route, increasing the 
end-to-end delay. Though the simulation gives good results with static 
networks, ina  more mobile environment data packets transmitted are likely 
to be lost. IN comparison to MLSR, the power savings achecived by PARO is 
significantly better.

Comments:

PARO addresses a significant issue with mobile ad hoc networks. But the 
main drawbacks of the paper are the strong assumptions it make.
- It assumes dynamic power transmission power and interference-free MAC.

- PARO does route optimization one step at a time. SO it would require 
several iterations before it would converge into the most optimal route. 
Also it is possible that the first iteration, which seemed optimal could 
result in a final route which is not the route achieving the minimum 
transmission power.

- PARO tries to minimize the power by redirecting through intermediate 
routes. But a re-director could chose to be one for many transmissions, 
thus depleting its energy source much earlier.

- Simulations does not take into account the effects of control packet 
overheads. This could have a significant impact on the power savings as the 
RTS/CTS packets are sent with maximum power.
