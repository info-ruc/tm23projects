PARO:
	The paper presents the PARO (a Power-Aware Routing Optimization) protocol. It aims to minimize the power consumption of the network as a whole, thus maximizing battery life and minimizing node and link failures.
	The basic mechanism used by this protocol is: When node A is talking to node B, and node C overhears this conversation and sees that by participating in this conversation as an intermediate hop, it(C) can lead to a decrease in the power consumption, it does so, by sending a "route-redirect" message to A. A similar means is used when it is discovered that there is a redundant link in a path and the redundant link is dropped. The protocol also handles the scenario where more than one node discovers that power-saving is possible, by giving preference to the node that leads to the maximum reduction of power usage.We see that even with a limited number of increase in the intermediate hops, there is a substantial reduction in the power-usage.

The weaknesses of the paper:
- The extra cost of having transmitters and receviers able to work with variable power levels has not been discussed.
- It assumes bi-directional links.
- The communication between A and B depends on the active involvement of an (hitherto) uninvolved node: This makes security hard to implement.
- The source node has to transmit explicit signalling packets when there is no traffic: This could lead to substantial overheads.
- In a situation where there is a path A-B-C and C lies just outside the range of the transmission range of A, the fact that power could be saved by having A transmit its packets directly to C is never discovered.
- Parameters other than power used has not been taken into account. The simulation should have compared performance of this protocol with others in terms of parameters such as end-end throughput, delay, etc. We cannot conclude that because the protocol has good performance wrt one parameter, it is applicable.
- In the simulation results shown (Fig 6), the transmission success ratio is less than 0.7 for a significant portion of the domain. This is not acceptable in most scenarios.

	The paper can be improved by making the simulation more rigorous, and making the route-restructuring more pro-active(eg: take into account the case mentioned above).
