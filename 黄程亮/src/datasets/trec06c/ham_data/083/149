This paper presents PARO, a power-aware routing optimization for
wireless networks.  Power is a key commodity in wireless networks and
all efforts to conserve it should be made.  Their goal is to identify
paths through the network that will minimize network power usage by
introducing additional nodes into a path.  The protocol works as
follows: If S wants to broadcast to D, it turns up its power such that
it can.  Since power is not a linear function distance, they argue it
may be beneficial for another node to cut the path into two portions to
reduce power consumption.  After S talks to D, if any other node
overhears the message and feels that it can save the network some power
by introducing itself into the path, it tells both S and D to include it
along their path for all future communication.  This process continues
until some steady state it reached.

They make some gross and unrealistic assumptions.  They assume a
wireless network wherein all hosts can communicate with all other hosts
(provided they turn up their power sufficiently high).  They also assume
links are bi-directional and equally "good" in both directions.

Their results seemed somewhat concocted to highlight those areas this
protocol is meant to address; they don't give any more "traditional"
measurements such as bandwidth, latency, etc.

Given their assumptions and limited results, the protocol seems useful. 
It certainly seems to save significant amounts of power, and that is
what they set out to accomplish.

Future work might consider a hybrid protocol; one that combines a
modified version of PARO and some other protocol to try to conserve
power in a network where all hosts are not necessarily reachable by
(paraphasing) "sufficiently increasing one's transmission power."
