The CEDAR paper proposes using only the core, a subset of the nodes in the
network, to perform routing. Each node is close to one core node, which is its 
dominator. Link states are propagated among core nodes to reduce the cost
to construct and maintain routes. The communication between two nodes consists
of three steps. First, the packet is sent to the dominator of the source, then 
forwarded to the dominator of the destination. Finally, it is delivered to the destination node 
from the dominator.  CEDAR can also apply to other reactive 
routing protocols, like AODV,DSR, to increase the scalability of the algorithm. 
Its cluster-based structure is also useful to many other applications, like leader 
election, or collaborative signal processing algorithms. 

The paper also presents a local algorithm to select and maintain the core structure.
Only local computation and topology information are involved to establish core 
nodes. Each core node behaves as the leader of its neighbors, and handles most 
routing workload. The link state algorithm will try to minimize the length of the
path between arbitrary source and destination. 

The paper has a evaluation part including several experiments to demonstrate 
the routing algorithm and test its performance under different setup. However,
the simulation model is a little simple. The number of nodes is small, and 
node density is not considered.   

The workload of the algorithm is not balanced over all nodes. It is reasonable to
believe that core nodes are the bottleneck of the whole network, and may 
consume their battery power soon. How to dynamically switch the roles of core nodes and regular 
nodes and still keep the network topology relatively static is an interesting research
problem. 

Scalability is another problem I worry while reading the paper. Is it possilbe to create
large-size clusters or select higher level core nodes. CEDAR only leaves the routing 
problem to core nodes. It fails while network size increases. Recent hardware advances have enabled distribution 
of large scale ad hoc networks in the soon future. An interesting question is how
to integrate CEDAR to other routing protocols.
