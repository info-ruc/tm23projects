This paper presents the Power-Aware Routing Optimization, PARO. PARO is an  
approach to routing which actually in a sense has a goal that is the reverse
of others which we have examined; rather than trying to minimize the 
number of hops on a route, PARO attempts to increase them so that 
transmissions can be done at lower power.

The basic idea behind PARO is that two nodes, A and B, can be 
communicating directly with each other when a third node, C, is between 
them. C can decide whether or not it can improve the overall power 
consumption, and, if so, negotiates a new route with A and B such that 
their packets travel through C. A (or B) then communicates with B (A) by 
sending a lower-power transmission to C, which forwards the transmission, 
also at low power, to B (A).

There are a few strong assumptions made in the development of PARO. The one
that concerns me most is that all the nodes should be able to 
communicate with each other, if they set their power levels high enough. This is simply
not possible in a large-scale MANET. This points clearly to a future
direction of work: incorporating PARO into another routing protocol. As its
name suggests, PARO would likely be best used as an optimization on top 
of an existing protocol. The paper does not actually present PARO as a 
complete MANET routing protocol anyway; it does not really address 
problems such as link failures and limited bandwidth.
