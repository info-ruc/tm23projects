This paper presents CEDAR, a routing algorithm whose main intent is to
provide robust and efficient routing with QoS capability, by using a
core: a "backbone" subset of all nodes, which form a dominating set.

The idea of replacing a broadcast with a series of unicasts along the
core is something of an evolution of the clustering solution to the
broadcast storm problem we studied in the earlier paper.

Like TORA, CEDAR does sacrifice optimality in order to achieve its other
goals such as robustness and locality. However, CEDAR's routes do
approach optimality as time goes on.

The QoS discussion was interesting. There is one major problem that I see,
however; the paper claims that "the bandwidth that can be provided on 
a path is the minumum of the individual available link bandwidths on     
the path." Without unacceptably high latency, a wireless MANET's paths
will have bandwidth less than any of the individual links because a)
typically mobile wireless stations have only one radio which can 
either transmit or receive at any given time, and b) the reception and 
transmission happen in the same medium.
