There are two main points in this paper: core-based algorithm and QoS (with
respect to bandwidth) routing.
Cores are elected by neighbors, thus the distance between any two cores is
at most 3. It may be done further to enlarge the neighborhood but let the
nodes 2 or more hops away elect their dominator, thus further shrink the
dominating set. The good point is that the election is local although may
not necessarily optimal. The shortcoming is in the case of a -> b -> c -> d
with a and d are cores,  when b wants to send to c, there will  be a detour.
But a possible solution here is that, since every node maintains a neighbor
table, it should firstly search in its neighbor table for the destination
before trying to route the packet through its dominator.
QoS routing is achieved by using of increase/decrease wave msg. But there
maybe a problem (or a typo) here at the second case sub-case (b) for the
handling of increase wave: bw(a, b) in cache should be updated after
forwarding is done. The establishment of the core path is kind of a DSR alg.
in multi-path version (then the path is chosen to satisfy QoS requirements).
So there are problems similar in DSR. Also, the paper didn't mention how the
path between neighboring cores are decided and how the dom(d) is found.
The use of RTS-CTS to relieve the problem of hidden-exposed terminal problem
and the duplicate rebroadcast should be a very good approach.
