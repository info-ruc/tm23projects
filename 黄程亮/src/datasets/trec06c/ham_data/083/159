Conserving Transmission Power in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks
PARO is a power-aware routing algirhtm based on the observation that many short 
hops are often more power efficient (in terms of transmission power only) than 
fewer long hops. Standard ad hoc routing protocols exarcerbate the power 
problems of mobile devices by using hop count, as opposed to power consumption, 
as the routing metric.
In this paper, the authors assume that all nodes are within transmission range 
of each other under maximum transmission power. In networks where this is not 
the case, a heirarchical scheme might be adopted, with PARO conserving power 
locally, and a more traditional routing protocol ensuring long-range 
connectivity. This is not discussed in detail. The auhors further assume, for 
the purposes of estimating minimum transmission cost to nearby nodes, that 
links are bidirectional and are essentially symmetric in terms of power 
requirements. 

In PARO, the primary route discovery mechanism nodes overhear data 
transmissions of nearby hosts. Each transmitted packet contains the power level 
at which the packet was sent. Nearby nodes, upon overhearing the packet, can 
essentially "subtract" the local recieve power from the transmitted power 
(according to a propagation model), and thereby detirmine the power needed to 
send to the originating node. Using this method, each node builds a cost table 
for nearby nodes.

During route initialization, a source will send directly to a destination at 
full power. Intermediate nodes, upon overhearing the transmission, can 
detirmine if it would be cost (power) efficient to insert themselves in the 
route. If so, then the node informs both sender and reciever of this fact. 
Source and dest can choose the most efficient neighbor as the next hop. This 
process is repeated until some threshold of improvement can no longer be met.

The most critical weakness of this paper, as usual, is in the evaluation. A 
simple simulation compares PARO to a modification of LSR (using power as the 
cost metric, rather than hops). Here, the modified LSR appears to find 
identical (if not better) power-aware routes. The disadvantage, the authors 
claim, is that LSR takes more broadcasts, which are quite expensive, to do so. 
PARO's advantage might dissapear, however, by using a routing algorithm less 
costly than LSR.
