CERT Summary CS-2002-03

   August 30, 2002

   Each  quarter, the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) issues the CERT
   summary  to  draw  attention  to  the types of attacks reported to our
   incident  response  team,  as  well  as  other noteworthy incident and
   vulnerability information. The summary includes pointers to sources of
   information for dealing with the problems.

   Past CERT summaries are available at http://www.cert.org/summaries/.
   ______________________________________________________________________

Recent Activity

   Since  the  last  regularly scheduled CERT summary, issues in May 2002
   (CS-2002-02),   we   have   released   several  advisories,  published
   statistics  for the second quarter of 2002, and written numerous white
   papers.

   For  more  current  information  on  activity  being  reported  to the
   CERT/CC,  please  visit the CERT/CC Current Activity page. The Current
   Activity  page  is  a  regularly updated summary of the most frequent,
   high-impact  types  of  security  incidents  and vulnerabilities being
   reported  to the CERT/CC. The information on the Current Activity page
   is reviewed and updated as reporting trends change.

    1. Multiple Vulnerabilities in CDE ToolTalk

       The  Common Desktop Environment (CDE) ToolTalk RPC database server
       contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that could allow a remote
       attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

       CERT Advisory CA-2002-26: Buffer Overflow in CDE ToolTalk
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-26.html

       Two  vulnerabilities  have  been  discovered in the Common Desktop
       Environment   (CDE)   ToolTalk  RPC  database  server.  The  first
       vulnerability  could  be  used  by  a  remote  attacker  to delete
       arbitrary  files,  cause  a denial of service, or possibly execute
       arbitrary code or commands. The second vulnerability could allow a
       local  attacker  to overwrite arbitrary files with contents of the
       attacker's choice.

       CERT Advisory CA-2002-20: Multiple Vulnerabilities in CDE ToolTalk
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-20.html

    2. Integer Overflow in XDR Library

       There  is  an integer overflow present in the xdr_array() function
       distributed  as  part  of  the  Sun Microsystems XDR library. This
       overflow  has  been  shown  to lead to remotely exploitable buffer
       overflows  in  multiple  applications, leading to the execution of
       arbitrary code. Although the library was originally distributed by
       Sun  Microsystems,  multiple  vendors have included the vulnerable
       code in their own implementations.

       CERT Advisory CA-2002-25: Integer Overflow in XDR Library
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-25.html

    3. Multiple Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL

       There  are  four remotely exploitable buffer overflows in OpenSSL.
       There  are  also  encoding  problems  in the ASN.1 library used by
       OpenSSL.  Several  of  these  vulnerabilities  could  be used by a
       remote  attacker  to  execute arbitrary code on the target system.
       All could be used to create denial of service.

       CERT  Advisory  CA-2002-23:  Multiple  Vulnerabilities in OpenSSL
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-23.html

    4. Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server

       The   CERT/CC   is   still  receiving  reports  of  systems  being
       compromised by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft SQL Server.
       The  Microsoft SQL Server contains several serious vulnerabilities
       that allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, alter
       database   contents,   compromise   SQL   servers,  and,  in  some
       configurations, compromise server hosts.

       SQL Server
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-22.html

    5. Buffer Overflows in Multiple DNS Resolver Libraries

       Buffer  overflow vulnerabilities exist in multiple implementations
       of DNS resolver libraries. Operating systems and applications that
       utilize vulnerable DNS resolver libraries may be affected.

       CERT  Advisory  CA-2002-19:  Buffer Overflows in Multiple DNS 
       Resolver Libraries
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-19.html

    6. OpenSSH Vulnerabilities in Challenge Response Handling

       There  are  two  related vulnerabilities in the challenge response
       handling  code  in  OpenSSH versions 2.3.1p1 through 3.3. They may
       allow  a  remote  intruder  to  execute arbitrary code as the user
       running sshd (often root). The first vulnerability affects OpenSSH
       versions  2.9.9  through  3.3,  that  have  the challenge response
       option  enabled,  and  use  SKEY  or  BSD_AUTH authentication. The
       second   vulnerability   affects  PAM  modules  using  interactive
       keyboard  authentication  in OpenSSH versions 2.3.1p1 through 3.3,
       regardless of the challenge response option setting.

       Response Handling
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-18.html

    7. Apache Web Server Chunk Handling Vulnerability

       There  is  a remotely exploitable vulnerability in the handling of
       large  chunks  of  data  in  web  servers that are based on Apache
       source   code.   This  vulnerability  is  present  by  default  in
       configurations  of  Apache web servers versions 1.3 through 1.3.24
       and  versions 2.0 through 2.0.36. The impact of this vulnerability
       is  dependent  upon the software version and the hardware platform
       the server is running on.

       CERT Advisory CA-2002-17: Apache Web Server Chunk Handling 
       Vulnerability
       http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-2002-17.html

    8. Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in ISC BIND 9

       A  denial-of-service  vulnerability  exists  in  version  9 of the
       Internet Software Consortium's (ISC) Berkeley Internet Name Domain
       (BIND)  server.  ISC  BIND  versions  8  and  4  are not affected.
       Exploiting  this  vulnerability will cause the BIND server to shut
       down.

       BIND 9
