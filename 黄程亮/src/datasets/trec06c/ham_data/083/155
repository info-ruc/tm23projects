The conservation of transmission power is important in devices such as =
notebook computers and cellular phones where transmission power plays a =
significant role in power consumed.  Reducing transmission power in such =
situations can dramatically increase the device's operational lifetime.  =
The MANET protocols we have previously looked at have been inefficient =
in terms of transmission power because their goal was to minimize the =
number of hops between source-destination pairs.  MANET protocols tend =
to use the maximum transmission power in order to minimize the number of =
forwarding nodes (redirectors) or they tend to use too many signaling =
packets being generated at a lower transmission power.  This paper =
offers a protocol, the power-aware routing optimization (PARO), which =
attempts to maximize the number of redirectors and thus minimize the =
transmission power consumed in the network.   PARO further deviates from =
MANET protocols in that it is not broadcast-based but node-to-node =
based.  PARO consists of three main operations:=20

(1)   Overhearing Algorithm - listens to packets sent in the MAC level =
in order to learn the minimum transmission power towards neighboring =
nodes

(2)   Redirecting Algorithm - computes whether power will be saved by =
redirecting the source-destination route to include this intermediate =
node

(3)   Route-Maintenance Algorithm - PARO is a protocol for both wired =
and wireless network.  Only wireless networks need to utilize the =
Route-Maintenance Algorithm.  PARO mainly relies on data packets as its =
source of routing information.    Signaling packets called =
route-maintenance packets are sent when no data packets are available =
within the specified interval route-timeout. =20

PARO relies on a few assumptions:

-         The transmission power used to communicate with other nodes =
must be dynamically adjustable.  This is not a far-reached assumption =
since commercial radios that support IEEE 802.11 and Bluetooth have this =
kind of power control

-         The transmission power needed to transmit a packet from A to B =
is similar to that of B to A.  This is a less reasonable assumption than =
the one above since it requires an interference-free MAC.

-         Every data packet successfully received is acknowledged at the =
link level

-         All nodes are located in transmission range of each other and =
can overhear any transmission by other nodes.  This is the biggest =
assumption in the protocol, especially in reference to wireless ad-hoc =
networks. =20

There are some flaws in PARO in convergence and scalability.  Since only =
one redirector can be added for each iteration, it takes several =
iterations for the network to converge to a final route.  In a highly =
mobile network, convergence may never take place.  Also, since only one =
intermediate node can be added as a redirector node at a time, as the =
network becomes denser, there is a greater increase in collision and =
bandwidth waste.  Finally, the optimal redirector added in the first =
resolution might not lead to the optimal route.  Even if the route =
itself was optimal, the power consumption may not be evenly distributed =
and thus a node in the network could end up with a considerably shorter =
lifetime (even if it was not a source or destination node).  Interesting =
enough, simulation shows that more than 3 redirectors may not be optimal =
(the original goal was to maximize the number of redirectors) due to =
increase in end-to-end delay and signaling overhead needed to maintain =
these routes.  This protocol did not mention how it handled network =
partition.  Also, it would be useful to know the processing power needed =
to implement PARO compared to the transmission power saved.  Some of the =
computations are difficult and complex, such as the computation of the =
minimum transmission power necessary to communicate with the overhead =
node. =20
