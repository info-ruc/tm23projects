CEDAR: a Core-Extraction Distributed Ad hoc Routing Algorithm

In this paper CEDAR a QoS routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks =
is presented. In CEDAR a core of the network is dynamically established =
which is a subset of the network. Stable high bandwidth links are =
incrementally propogated to the nodes of the core. Each core node is =
responsible for mainitaining local topology of the nodes in its domain =
and perform route computation on behalf of these nodes. The major goals =
acheived in this paper are
- The core broadcast which is used for propagation of increase/decrease =
waves uses unicast transmission instead of broadcast. As flooding is =
lossy which wastes lot of network and battery resources this results in =
saving a lot in terms of network resources.
- A change in network topology causes a recomputation of the core graph =
in the locality of the topology change and hence does not involove =
recomputation of the entire core graph.
- The use of core based network topology management requires use of few =
nodes for state managemen thus minimizing overhead.
- Since broadcasts are highly unreliable due to the presence of hidden =
and exposed nodes so reliable unicast channels computed by the core =
nodes are expected to be more reliable.
- Use of increase/decrease waves with different propagation speeds for =
establishment of core path in route computation phase. The difference in =
propagation speeds of these two type of waves ensures that information =
about unstable links are propogated faster.

The major weaknesses in the paper are=20
-There is geater load on core nodes as compared to other nodes in its =
domain and hence more consumption of battery power. So keeping the chord =
nodes up for a long time is a challenge which is not addressed in the =
paper.=20
- As all the messages are routed through the core nodes  resulting in =
narrow links between core nodes other nodes in its domain. The paper =
does not much discuss on load balancing. Also some some simulation =
results pertaining to this could be provided.=20
- The paper also does not discuss the implications if a core nodes =
fails.=20
