Paper 13 - PARO

This paper identifies network activity, specifically transmissions,
and transmission power as a key component in the longevity of MANET
devices. The paper proposes that the focus of contemporary routing
protocol do not take advantage of adjustments in transmission
level. By using intermediary nodes to transmit at a lower power level
to convey the message, MANET devices can extend their battery
life. PARO describes a protocol in which intermediary nodes can detect
and use potential transmissions that can be routed through them to
save power.

PARO is the first routing protocol to fully consider the implications
of power consumption within the routing protocol itself. PARO seems to
be a not a full routing protocol in of itself, i.e. such aspects as
destination discovery and route maintenance as vague and
unclear. (i.e. what if the destination is not within a transmission
neighborhood?) PARO does seems to be a good method of fine tuning
paths created by other routing protocols to become more power
efficient.

In general, failure conditions (node death, dropped packets) are not
considered. The increased failure rate that occurs when path lengths
are increased and transmission power decreased could be
problematic. It would be nice if the paper included actual costs of
transmission of a packet, which is not simply a function of
transmission power. It is interesting to note that MAC level
transmissions such as RTS/CTS are still sent at full power. What are
the implications of this, given the high fixed energy cost of sending
packets? Also, promiscuous listening on the ether means that adapters
are not able to take advantage of fully powering down during other
node transmissions.

One big difference between this paper and the others we have read is
the existence of simulation data and an actual
implementation. Although the actual results aren't really anything
astounding (or enlightening), a proof of concept is nice. The
simulation graph is surprisingly sparse for data points. The
comparison graph with MLSR only shows the difference between energy
wasted by the initial startup costs. What about dynamic behavior of
PARO, and say, another reactive protocol using the same metrics to
obtain routes?

One future direction would be incorporation of PARO as a feature of
another protocol to fine-tune routes. An interesting topic would be
adaptation of power level due to the density of surrounding
neighborhood. This could cause other protocols to naturally adopt
PARO-like routes.
