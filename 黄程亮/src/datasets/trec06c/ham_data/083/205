hi tim,

   i am on sabbatical so i won't be around this week. the good news is
that IS is now supporting linux/unix and sasko has already been doing 
some of the system administration on our linux machines. sasko can get 
you in my lab. if you need help getting into the system, then call me
at 757-269-7454. grv2 is the lone sun machine in the small lab adjacent 
to our supercomputer.
