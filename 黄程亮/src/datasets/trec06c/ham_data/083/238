There are three major contributions of this paper.  One is a
hierarchical routing algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks.  This is
important because a hierarchical scheme can greatly reduce the effect
of broadcasts, and has the potential to scale much better than other
schemes.  Related to this contribution, is the contribution of an 
election algorithm for selecting the backbone of an ad hoc network.  
This is essential to forming the hierarchy used in the routing algorithm
presented in this paper, but also is important to other ad hoc
systems, such as peer-to-peer networks.  The third major contribution
is a routing algorithm that is concerned with QoS based on bandwidth.
This is important because some applications need bandwidth guarantees
and the fact that they are running over an ad hoc network should be
transparent to them.

A weakness of the paper is the lack of QoS analysis with respect to
things such as delay.  I know their protocol is based on bandwidth
guarantees, but I think that delay is also important to the
applications that would want these guarantees because a large
bandwidth does not necessarily mean low delay, and so I'd like to see
more analysis of this.

It would be interesting to see larger simulations of this protocol.  I
think that in terms of scalability, hierarchical schemes are the most
promising of the ones we have seen so far.  The authors recommend the
protocol for small to medium size networks; however, the work in the
paper lays a good foundation for performance in large networks.
