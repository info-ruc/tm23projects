Boozhu!

Just when I think I can shut my brain off for a second...:)

The evaluation report is almost complete. I just have to scan the =
pictures for you. The straw bale workshop consumed most of my time since =
the end of July so I have been trying to catch-up on all of our other =
projects for the past 3 weeks.

The invoice should have reached you or will very soon.

As for in-kind services. Yikes. This is hard to breakdown because the =
straw bale workshop is just a small part of a large project. I'll do the =
best that I can.

White Earth Health Division- Minwamanji'o Project
my salary for 160 hours
my volunteer staff  200 hrs (combined)
(this does not include the hours of the actual workshop)

White Earth Water & Sewer
10 hr. use of backhoe

White Earth Tribal Council
2 acres of lakefront property (+ the usage of 13 acres of wooded area, a =
garage and barn)

White Earth Community Food Project
4 cases of juice spritzers
organic banana chips
dried organic pineapple rings

Many other contributions have been made that involve the building such =
as a stove, freezer, compost toilet (promised), greywater system, =
various supplies...

Please let me know if you need an estimated dollar amount. Again, this =
will be difficult as some of these items would be unobtainable =
elsewhere. The most accurate information that I can give you is that all =
of the contributions, including the $$'s from the Uof M are priceless.=20

This will most likely drive the Number Crunchers nuts, but how can you =
put a number on the stuff that really counts from this project?

Steph

P.S. I will get over being so sentimental one day. Or maybe not.

  I hope you've had some time to enjoy all that you and Minwamanji'o =
have accomplished this summer.  Do you have any questions about either =
the evaluation form or the invoice process? =20
  I'm putting together some information for the Deans - we meet this =
friday in St. Paul - I want to account for the in-kind contributions and =
cash contributions to the project partnerships we're involved in.  Can =
you estimate the value of the in-kind contributions to the workshop and =
building?=20
  =20
  Thank you.
