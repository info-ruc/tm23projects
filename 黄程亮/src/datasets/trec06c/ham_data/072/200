Subject: Freeware ICC11 and bad iasm11.exe?

Me again,

 I just got the ICC11 freeware from the Miniboard site and installed it, moving
the crt.s over as it says to do in the docs, etc.  I tried to compile the
test compile of icc11 dhry.c printf.c and got a LOT of "phasing" errors,
whatever that means.  The docs say that this is caused by a problem with
the current (at that time) iasm11.exe program and that an older one is on
the site to replace it with that doesn't have that problem.  However, the
"older" version on the site is the exact same version and has the exact same
problem.  Does anyone have such a version that does not get this "phasing"
error?  Where can I get it?  Or, should I just spring the $50 for the ICC11
code that is commercially available, hmm, is it still just $50?

Help!  I'm ready to ditch this board of so many problems...

thanks,
Dennis Clark (DLC)
