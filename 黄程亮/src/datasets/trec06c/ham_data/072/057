you're almost right.

if you plugged a nimh pack into the HB's charge jack, the external
pack would charge the internal batteries.

but it would not power the board significantly.

this is because the HB's charge jack includes a current-limit resistor
(designed to allow the correct current for indefinite trickle-charge).

so you won't get enough current through to run motors or anything,
you'll just trickle-charge the internal pack via the external source.

while we're on the topic, the dangerous thing that you should *not* do
is wire a high-current source (like a nimh pack) to deliver charge
current through the RJ11 jack.  this charge path is not
current-limited internally to the HB (except via the fuse) and bad
things can happen.  the internal nicad pack will deliver and/or accept
large amounts of current, causing big discharges of heat and
potentially bad results (e.g. battery pack explosions).  the fuse
protects against this but why play with fire.

are you having big battery life problems with the internal pack?
