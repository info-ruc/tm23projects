   Hangs as in locks up completely and the machine has to be reset or hangs 
in the case of providing an error message?  There are a couple of things 
I'd try, first is try the TimeDX keyboard test, actually run it and press 
keys to make sure TimeDX can acquire the and get input from the 
keyboard.  If that fails the next step is to install another version of 
DirectX, perhaps the one you have is busted somehow.  Should TimeDX succeed 
(and DMDX actually be hanging) I'll have to cook up a passpoint version of 
the latest DMDX and see if that can tell me anything.  You have tried the 
latest version of the code I suppose?
