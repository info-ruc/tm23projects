I am by no means an expert on the subject but this is how I did it. First I
cut the heavy motor power trace as shown in the FAQ. Next I soldered a four
pin female header on top of the expansion board where the expansion board
picks up power for the servos(Handyboard J13). I then soldered the male
connector onto the external battery pack and marked the positive side with red
nail polish so not to reverse the connection since it is not polarized. This
setup allows the main Handyboard to run off the enclosed battery and the motor
ports, servo ports and Lego ports are powered by the external battery. Since I
am using a 9.6v nicad pack as an external battery it causes no problems but if
you want to use a higher or lower voltage external battery you would then have
to consider the effect on the servo and Lego ports. Hope this is helpful.
