   Nope, that's all we're looking for, means the code works.

    Yeah, well that's not quite my definition of "hang" but I can excuse 
you calling it a hang, it's not so much the program hanging as your item 
file hangs.  It simply means that the program has no valid definitions of 
input keys so it's going to wait forever.

   Nope.  As noted by Jean-Francois Nedelec there seems to be some sort of 
quotation screwup occuring, perhaps you french guys could send me one of 
your .RTF item files and I can add the french version of quotes to it so 
stop this happening again.
