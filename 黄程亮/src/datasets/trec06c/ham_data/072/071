If you can't afford a photometer/luminometer/colorimeter you could try
doing flicker photometry. If you change the color of something at about 20
Hz it will appear to flicker. If you vary the colors, you will notice that
the flicker is noticeably lower at the point where the two colors are
equiluminant.
