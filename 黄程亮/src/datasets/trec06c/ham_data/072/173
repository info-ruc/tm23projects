Hello,
My name is Mrs. Melissa Edward I am a dying woman who had decided to donate
what I have to you.
 I am 59 years old and was diagnosed of cancer about 2 years ago, after the
death of my husband who had left me everything he worked for.
 I have been touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from my
late husband to you for the good work of God, rather than allow my relatives
to use my husband's hard earned funds ungodly. I have asked God to forgive
me all my sins and i believe he has because He is a merciful God. I will be
going in for an operation, and i pray that i survive the operation. I have
decided to WILL/donate the sum of $3,200,000(Three million Two hundred
thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and to help the
motherless, less privileged and also for the assistance of the widows. At
the moment I cannot take any telephone calls, due to the fact that my
relatives are around me and i have been restricted by my doctor from taking
telephone calls because i deserve all thee rest i can get. Presently, I have
informed my lawyer about my decision in WILLING this fund to you. I wish you
all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and please use the
funds well and always extend the good work to others. Kindly Contact my
lawyer through this email address raymlindon@netscape.net   if you are
interested, so that he can arrange the release of the funds ($3,200,000.00)
to you. I know I have never met you but I have been directed to do this by
God, and i hope you act sincerely. 
NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the
task is accomplished, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last
wish, due to the fact that i do not want relatives or family members
standing in the way of my last wish.
Happy
 Love, Mrs. M. Edward
