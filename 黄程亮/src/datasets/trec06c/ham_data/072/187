Hi, I've successfully located and compiled the IC files for the Handy
Board. I can load and run programs on the board, BUT the digital
input(s) are not being "seen". E.g. a simple program like: 

void test3(){
  while (1){
    if (digital(10))
      printf("10 is active!");
    else{
      printf("10 is not active!");
  }
}

never sees the input. Now here's the strange thing, I can use the DOS
version of IC (from the latest Gleason Research CD), load the same file in
to the handy board and it'll work! I've been able to duplicate this odd
behavior with multiple boards.

The README for the linux version of IC says it's intended to work with
handyboard version 2. Does this mean it won't work with version 1.2? I
have a guess that this has to do with the libraries and drivers, but I'm
not sure. 

The board has IC v2.81, v1.21 is stamped on the bottom left, and I'm using
the expansion board as well. 
System is RedHat 6.1.
The IC files are from ic-src-2.860-beta
