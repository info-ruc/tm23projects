RECTIFICATION!

        I went back and tried something. I wrote the header line with my
French keyboard, and the program works. So, the quotes CAN be typed with the
French keyboard, although indeed they should be "" not the curly funny ones
that you get with the auto-correction.
        SO, why was I not getting any response from my keyboard? The answer
lies in parameters. I parameterized the yes(mpr ) and no (mnr )keys, but not
the request (mr). When I copied the line from Jean-Francois Nedelec's
message, I copied the (mr +Espace) parameter too. AND, it worked. 
        To summarize, if your keyboard is other than English, you must
parameterize all three values (mr; mpr; mnr) with the names of keys that
your TimeDx test recognizes on your keyboard. Ditto for that little 
plastic thing that someone once named a "mouse."

                Thanks for the help and hope this too will be of use,

                        Cheryl
