I am having students in one of my classes build handyboards, and most are
working fine, but some are failing.  They all passed intermediate tests, but
failed when fully assembled.  The most common failure mode that I am seeing
results in the following:

The computer goes into bootstrap mode, and I can program it (the lights
flash etc), but it doesn't seem to run properly (I get 16 black rectangles on
the LCD), though the 6811 clock is running.

Is this failure mode common (I have it on multiple boards) and is there
a known fix?

Thanks
