Hi,
    This isn't an off topic question...
    Has anyone tried programming the serial port (on Linux) to communicate
with the Handyboard?  I am working on an RF link between the Handyboard and
a PC via serial communication, but I don't know much about serial port
programming.  Most (yeah, I have searched around the internet a lot) of the
info I got from the internet is not very helpful.  Can anyone point me in a
good direction (a book, a sample code may be)...  All I want is to be able
to read and write to a serial port...
    Thanks.
