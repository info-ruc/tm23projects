   The you use the Zillion response mode, <zil> in the parameter 
line.  IIRC the use of <zil> automatically turns feedback off but you can 
always use <nfb> anyways.  The output will be a .ZIL file and it will have 
all keystroke information for whatever the timelimit is after the 
clockon.  If you want to only monitor a few keys (remembering that 
depressions, +keyname, are separate from releases, -keyname) then you can 
validate them with <vzk>, once one keystroke has been validated only 
validated keystrokes are recorded.
