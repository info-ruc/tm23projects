Would it be possible to put in some additional error checking into the
scrambling code to detect problems such as this? I have a suspicion that
one of these days I'm going to get a visit from a distraught researcher who
has lost data or failed to present all their stimuli due to an error like
this.

A simple check that the number of items in the experiment is an exact
multiple of the group size would be useful. It would also be useful to have
an option to override this diagnostic and still display the final set of
items (i.e. to display the group in which there are items missing). 

Thanks,

Matt
