The only big problem I can see with this file is that you should omit the
<<azk> keyword from the top line of the file (since you specify <<zil 5>
later, this is redundant). 


By the way, <<zil 5> will allow the subject to make 5 responses on each item - is that what you want? You can set up <<ZillionEnterKey> so that the subject types a response, and then presses enter when they are happy with their response. 


Alternatively, what I have used before is <<zil> and <<ZillionOneResponse> - this will accept the first key that the subject presses, ideal for ratings tasks. You can then set up your 5 acceptable ratings as <<ValidZillionKey> (e.g. <<vzk +1> <bigger><<vzk +2> <<vzk +3> <<vzk +4> <<vzk +5> for the numbers one to 5).


</bigger>Hope this helps. If you would like an example file that I've used for ratings tasks let me know.


Matt
