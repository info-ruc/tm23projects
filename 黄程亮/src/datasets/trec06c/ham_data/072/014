Jerry,
I really haven't timed how long a battery charge lasts on the Handyboard but I
did add a second 9.6v battery pack for the purpose of isolating the motor
power from the logic circuit power. I did this to eliminate motor RF
interference to the sensor readings. As a side effect my time between
recharges has increased. I had to cut the motor power trace and ad a jumper to
the expansion board to power the motors, expansion servos and lego ports. I
see no reason why you couldn't just add another 9.6v battery pack in parallel
to the original. In this way you would maintain the 9.6v input but effectively
double your ampere hour capacity and your time between recharges.
