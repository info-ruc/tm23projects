Dear friends,
I have been trying to set up a visual search paradigm using DMDX but when I 
want set the mouse as my input device, I keep receiving this error:
Button name <+button 2> not found on input devices
I have included my parameter line so that you could help with what is wrong 
with it:
   N16 <s 24> <azk> <cr> <nfb> f38 <t 4000> d150 <id "mouse"> <dbc 0> <dwc 
000255000> <vm 800 600 600 24 0>  <+button 2>

By the way, what should I write to assure requesting to start at the 
beginning of each block?
Sincerely,
Bahador
