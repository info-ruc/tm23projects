Hello out there. Has anyone tried to run dmdx, using Win 98/Office 2000, in
FRENCH, with a keyboard (or even mouse) as the input device and been
successful?  I have tried all possible versions of <id "Clavier">, case
sensitive/insensitive, quotes/no quotes, with an added mpr and mnr/without
them, and still cannot get anywhere. The RTF program will run in the
diagnostic mode just fine. It hangs however if asked to query the keyboard.
Any useful info would be greatly appreciated.

        Cheryl
