I've been developing an experiment using conditional branching to jump back
to an earlier trial if the subject performs with less than 75% accuracy
on each section of 4 trials. I get a printout of the accuracy in the window
immediately after clicking to save the data, but the .zil file that is created
only gives the RT and not the accuracy. Is there a command I can use in
the parameter line to have the .zil file give accuracy before each conditional
branch decision that is based on accuracy?

Thanks,

Keo
