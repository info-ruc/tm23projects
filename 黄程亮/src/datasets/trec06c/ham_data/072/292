Dear Jonathan,
I am the one who is setting up a visual search paradigm with mouse as the 
input device. I have set my parameter line as below:
N16 <s 24> <azk> <cr> <nfb> f38 <t 4000> d150 <id "mouse"> <dbc 0> <dwc 
000255000> <vm 800 600 600 24 0>
And in order to start each block –as you had suggested- I have included the 
following:
$
0 "Press spacebar to continue";
$
I have a question now and that is: if I have set the mouse as input device, 
then it wouldn’t be logical to expect the block to start through pushing the 
sapcebar on the “keyboard”. Does DMDX support both devices at the same time?
The fact is, everything goes fine and the sentence “Press spacebar to start” 
appears in the display alright but pushing the spacebar or any other key (on 
the keyboard) or any buttons on the mouse won’t take any effect until I stop 
the DMDX processing by Esc, and then the last line in the report window 
clearly denotes the initiation of scrambling and even the first (randomly 
chosen) line to be processed is selected and the corresponding image is 
buffered.
Another problem of mine is that I currently do not have a three-button 
mouse. Do you think it would interrupt the item file from being processed?
Sincerely,
Bahador Bahrami
