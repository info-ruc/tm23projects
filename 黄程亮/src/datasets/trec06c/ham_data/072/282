Hello again.
        I have indeed run the TimeDx keyboard test. The keyboard is known by
my machine as "Clavier" When I run the test, the typed keys get highlighted.
Should there be more than that? Note that the values of the keys are those
of an ENGLISH keyboard which is rather odd given that my keyboard is
parameterised for FRENCH. I already tried writing Clavier using the English
keyboard, I get no better luck.
        What I mean by hanging is that the message to press a key pops up,
but then it goes no further. I have to escape out of the program. None of
the keys on the board respond aside from the escape key.  
      
        My mouse aka Souris, also responds under TimeDx but not when I try
to use it as a response device.

        I am using version 2.1.00 of DMDX.  Perhaps a lower version would
work better?

                Cheryl
