Hi everyone, I'm studying C programing now, but I've had my handy board for
more than a year now, I want to now if anyone has a small project, just a
motor and some sensors, with all the code I have to put, and how to put the
code in the IC program and down load it to my board.  I want to start
practicing now. thanks
