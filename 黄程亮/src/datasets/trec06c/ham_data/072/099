The instructions on connecting the Polaroid Ultrasonic Ranging System to the
Handy Board (at http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-
board/software/sonar.html) say to be sure and install the 0.1 uF capacitor in
the C7 position on the sonar board.  It is unclear what is meant here.  Is
this refering to the Polaroid 6500 ranging circuit board?  If so, what is the
C7 position?  I can't seem to find any reference to "the C7 position"
