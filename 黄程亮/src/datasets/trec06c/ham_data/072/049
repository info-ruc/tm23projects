Are you getting a good ground????????????
If it works.. then hey!
RS232 is +10 to -10 but there is room for slop!
+7 to -7 will work too!!!!!!! It just won't drive a cable to the max
length of the RS232 spec.
Most of the time though people just don't have a good reference point and
ground isn't ground.
