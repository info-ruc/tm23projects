Hi everyone,
I have 2 questions.
1- Is DMDX capable of doing loops. I have a block of dmdx code and i need to
do it 1000 times.

2- I wrote a code to display 10 frames per second for 5 seconds. I have a
picker system that produce 100 RF pulses for 5 seconds. I want to
synchronize the two systems.
First run the dmdx (10 frames/sec. for 5 seconds)using the computer internal
clock and at the same time accepting "counting" the RF pulses from the
picker system. So, if the computer finished displaying the frames for 5
seconds and the RF pulses coming from the scanner is not complete (100),
DMDX will continue displaying the frames until it finishes counting the
pulses.
