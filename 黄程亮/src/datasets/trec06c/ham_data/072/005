You are going to find that it is not the encoders as I thought also.  The HB
seems to be incapable of reading correctly.  I don't know why, but I have been
trying for about 3 months with no/or little success.  Someone knows, but no
one is telling.  I have tried Hall effects, IR led's and reluctance pickups.
It may do well for 4-5 rpm ,but no faster.  I am now trying averaging.  For
14.95 you can a simple little bike computer that does what $300 can't do.  Go
figure.
