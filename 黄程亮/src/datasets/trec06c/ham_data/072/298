   Yep.

   Yep, by default the third mouse button is bound to request, but of 
course if you've only got a two button mouse there is no third button for 
request.  By default if there are no input devices specified DMDX looks for 
the keyboard, if you specify any input devices it no longer maps the 
keyboard unless you specify it as well, ie: <id mouse> <id keyboard>

   No, there is specific code in the initial default mouse mapping routines 
that don't throw an error if button 2 isn't found.
