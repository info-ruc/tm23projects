If you upgrade to the commercial version of icc11 not only do you get a 
downloader that works under windows 9x but also very nice library 
interface. (disclaimer: I wrote the library :-)

In general on embedded systems you _don't_ want to use printf, way more 
features than you need. Try using "puts()" to print strings and 
printdec(int x) to print a decimal number. Between the two of them you can 
write some really tight code.
