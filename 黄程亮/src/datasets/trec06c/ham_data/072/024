i'm not sure if wiring two nicad packs in parallel is a good idea.
the packs would fight each other if either one's voltage varied even
slightly from the other.

i'd recommend either (1) John's initial suggestion of adding a
separate pack solely for motor drive, cutting traces as he mentions,
or (2) replacing the stock pack with a higher capacity one.

get the best nicad you can fit into the case.  should be able to get
900 mAh or better.  

just don't go nickel metal hydride; those require a different (more
complicated) charging circuit.
