Dear group:

It would be very helpful if everyone would put in a meaningful subject line 
rather than "dmdx" when sending messages to the listserv.  That way people 
know if it's an issue that might be pertinent to their own lab.  It also 
helps to find information in Jonathan's archive of these messages, which, 
by the way, is a really good resource for many of these questions.

Thanks,

Lee Ryan
