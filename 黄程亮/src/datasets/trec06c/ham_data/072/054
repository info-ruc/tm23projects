Subject: Batteries again
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

As Fred is recommending using nicads due to the constant trickle charge when
connected to the mains adapter I have a question regarding the nicad batteries.
If the batteries are trickle charged before they are fully discharged (usual
practice I assume due to memory backup circuitry) won't the nicad 'memory'
effect come into play ?. Does anyone have any experiences of this sort of
problem with the HB ?.

Thanks.
