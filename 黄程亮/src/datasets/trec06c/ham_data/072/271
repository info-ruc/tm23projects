   Is that an error or just a warning?  The code by default maps responses 
for a three button mouse, if it doesn't find the key it simply prints a 
message that it couldn't find it.

   That would be a syntax error.  For a start you shouldn't need to specify 
anything about <+button 2>, and even if you did it would have to be some 
command to unmap it, but the damage is done by that time anyway.  You 
should be fine, just ignore the message about the missing button.

   Easiest solution when using <cr> is to include and instruction at the 
beginning of each block with dollars around it to stop it being scrambled:

$ 0 "press the spacebar to continue";$
