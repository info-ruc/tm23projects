Dear friends,
I am trying to setup a visual search paradigm with colorful 
target/distractors but i am not sure about my monitor's colorimetric values 
and my control over them.
how can i calibrate my monitor so that i could make sure that the subjects 
are viewing an equiluminant scene throughout the experiment.
sincerely,
bbahrami
