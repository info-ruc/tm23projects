From what I could understand from the documentation
(http://www.sharp.co.jp/ecg/pdf/sys/gp2d02.pdf), you could use one timing
signal for all of them, as long as each sensor is connected to its own
output line (to which the sensor would serially output its 8 bit value).
Since there are 8 digital input pins and one digital output pin on the
HandyBoard, you should not have any problems hooking up several sensors.
On the other hand, there might be some timing issues in the software
regarding reading several digital inputs simultaneously.
I haven't actually hooked multiple GP2D02's up myself, though.

Good luck.
