Hi..

I am also facing problem in serial communications.
My problem is that I am trying to use the handyboard to drive a modem. I have
used a cross-serial cable to connect my handyboard's external serial board to
a modem. But whenever I run my app, its heartbeat stop. (maybe the problem is
my app).

But, I have run the same app with the handyboard connected to the
hyperterminal with a straight cable and it works beautifully. It is able to
send and also receive any input that I typed on the hyperterminal.

Is there something I am missing here?

thanks
mich
