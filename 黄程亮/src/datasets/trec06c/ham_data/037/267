Yes, the pulley wheels near the drive wheels were drilled to accomodate
0.1" dia. disk magnets, available at the local hobby shop.  The magnets
activate the Hall effect magnetic sensors that are tucked away into the
chassis (not easily seen in the photos).

These encoders are simple to use and in the current configuration
provide one count for each two centimeters or so of travel, which is
sufficient to keep the robot tracking straight across the floor.  For
maze navigating & dead reckoning I'll probably need to gear up the
encoders by a factor of two or three.
