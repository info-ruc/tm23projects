I glued a couple of the thin Lego strips to the bottom of my HandyBoard to
make it quick and easy to plop the board firmly onto a Lego base yet still
have it easily removable.

Doing this you must be certain to get the correct Lego spacing, so first
attach the strips to a Lego base.  Then carefully drip some glue onto only
the tops of the strips, sit the HandyBoard on top, and wait patiently a
long long time to ensure the glue has fully set.

Hopefully when you then pull the HandyBoard away from the base the thin
strips will still be attached to the HB so you can now easily mount and
remove the board on Legos as often as you wish.
