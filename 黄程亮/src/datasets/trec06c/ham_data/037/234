That's an excellent suggestion.  Thanks, Max.

There are many other tips on Lego robot construction techniques in an
article titled The Art of Lego Design by Fred Martin.  It's available
for download from the Handy Board web site:

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/techdocs/index.html

There have been numerous helpful hints on the mailing list that could
probably be found in the archives.  For example, I learned on the list
that the best way to attach sensors to the robot is by gluing 'em to
Lego bricks with hot melt glue.  The glue is tough, but can be removed
if necessary, and doesn't seem to damage the Lego bricks.  So far I
haven't fried any sensors, either  ;^)

I've found that the best way to mount a Polaroid sonar transducer is to
glue it to one of the extra large pulley wheels of the type that comes
with the pneumatic compressor kit (someone else on the list uses an
extra large, 40-tooth gear wheel).  Then it can just be "plugged in" to
the robot chassis wherever.

Also, as many of you already know, it's difficult to make a good caster
using Legos for use on a differential drive mobile base.  I came up with
a design for a lightweight, sturdy caster that works great.  If anyone
is interested, I could zap a picture of it onto my web site and give you
all the URL.
