Dear Mr Pennington,
	Have you configured IC using ic -config command ? This sets the
library file and its directory. For handy board, the library file
is lib_hb.lis.This is a list file which contains the words lib_hb.c and
lib_hb.icb. The lib_r22.lis file is needed for 6.270 board. The IC that
you are using must be configured for the 6.270 board.
	Put all lib_hb.* files in one directory. Give that directory name
in the IC configuration. Configure lib_hb.lis to be the name of the lib
file. 

							Yours sincerely,
							    Nitin
