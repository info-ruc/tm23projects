If you are trying to track something moving, it is pretty simple, if
you have a fixed camera.

Take two images, separated by a reasonable amount of time (2
subsequent frames may not be enough). XOR the two frames, everything
the same will show as 0's everything that has changed will be 1's. 

Sometimes edge detecting will be required, and allow you less data to
XOR, but certainly if you are only trying to track something, B&W data
will be enough.

After enough frames are collected, you can start calculating direction
and velocity.
