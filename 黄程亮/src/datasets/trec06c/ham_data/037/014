Hi Max Davies and everyone,

In your documentation (irinfo.txt), you said that we need to disable the IR
input interrupt routine before transmitting another signal, what is the
reason behind that ?

As the IR input and output are both interrupt driven codes, why can't they
transmit and receive simultaneously ?

Currently I'm working on some communication protocol between multiple Handy
Board, if I need to transmit and receive signal concurrently, how can it be
done ?

Anyone has any advice on the above issue...

Thanks in advance...

Regards,
James.
