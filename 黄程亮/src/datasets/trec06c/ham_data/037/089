Subject: ICC11v5 - interrupts
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have a HB (running under IC3.2) that is linked to a 'slave' TCOMP
board (68HC11E1, 32k ram) which is programmed using ICC11v5. I need a
function similar to 'msleep' on the TCOMP unit. I am trying to use
portions of Chuck McManis'  HB library for ICC11 (from the ImageCraft
website). I have tried to digest as much as I can from the 'Pink Book',
as well as from the ICC11v5 manual. I've gone through a bunch of code 
snippets but am not able to implement them in an actual program.

If anyone is using or is familiar with ICC11v5, I could sure use some
help!
