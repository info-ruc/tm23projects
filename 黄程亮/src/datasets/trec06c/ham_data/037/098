ahah, good question.

the exp bd grabs the 9v motor power for the servos, sonar, and 9v lego
sensors.

if you're not using any of these, you could leave connector off the
exp bd and you'll have no probs.

if these are important, you need to reconnect the severed trace on
your HB (reapplying the HB's 9v batt to that port), and then
separately apply your external power to pin 8 of the two motor driver
chips.

the easy way to do this is to remove the two chips, bend out pin 8
parallel to the chip bodies, insert back in sockets, and then run a
wire to the two pin 8's carrying in your external pwr.

external gnd can go to pin 4, 5, 12, or 13 of either chip (using the
same method).
