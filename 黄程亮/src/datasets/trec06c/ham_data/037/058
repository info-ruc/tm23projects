I bought the "Personal Robot Navigator" last year=2E  The book focuses on
the simulation software (came with the book)=2E  There is almost no
hardware discussions at all and I found that frustrating (especially after
reading "Mobile Robots"!)  The model used is based on shaft encoders,
digital compass and location beacons=2E  No real world implementation of
these is discussed=2E  However, there is extensive theoretical software
modeling done=2E  I would suggest a book like "Artificial Intelligence in
Mobile Robots" if you are interested in case studies of successful
navigation methods=2E
