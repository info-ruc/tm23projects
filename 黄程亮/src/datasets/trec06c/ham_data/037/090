The modulation frequency of the IR diodes must match the sensor
(depending on exact part number, around 38 KHz) within +/- 3 KHz.  As
you move away from the center frequency, detection drops off sharply.
Are you able to confirm the modulation frequency?
One other problem that I ran into with this same circuit (built using a
PIC as the controller), was the LED itself was at a different wavelength
as the sensor.  I did find that the RS superbright IR LED worked, but
some others did not.  Alot of trial and error.
