Hi, Toy Class members,

At class next week we will be talking about Expressive Toys, with an
emphasis on music-related activities.

To prepare for the class, could you:

1) Read the two handouts: Brain Opera (Electronic Musician) and excerpt
from "Sound Choices" on child music learning.

2) Learn about some of my group's recent projects in interactive music
instruments and installations by looking carefully at:

	http://www.media.mit.edu/hyperins/meteor

3) For more detailed information about some Brain Opera
hyperinstruments, look at:

	http://www.media.mit.edu/~joep/TTT.BO/index.html 
	http://theremin.media.mit.edu/~woliver/singhtml/main.html
	http://marrin.www.media.mit.edu/people/marrin/Thesis.htm

4) The hyperinstruments designed for the Brain Opera, and the
interactive music installations at the Meteorite Museum, were designed
for the general public (and for public situations).  Think about one of
the Brain Opera instruments and how you would adapt it into a Music Toy
for young children, either in the 4-6 age range, or even younger.  Feel
free to imagine a different concept if you are so inspired, but trace it
back to its Brain Opera roots.  Please send a brief description of your
Music Toy idea, and come ready to discuss it in class.

Tod
