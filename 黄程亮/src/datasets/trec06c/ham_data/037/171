Does anyone know of a good but simple to use schematic an PCB design
freeware program out there on the net?, I have downloaded a few but they
vary complex and hard to learn for the simple board I need to create. I like
something with a good component library and auto router for Windows that
won't take weeks to learn to make a simple board.
Thanks,
Clancy
