	Has anyone hacked the sonar out of a sonar tape measure?  Radio Shack
sells sonar tape measures for about $25.00, that's half the price of buying
the transducer and sensor together.  
	I mentioned in a previous posting that I am interested in running six
sonar sensors off of the parallel port of a PC.  Therefore, the hack would
need to where I would connect to the parallel port from the measuring tape
board.
