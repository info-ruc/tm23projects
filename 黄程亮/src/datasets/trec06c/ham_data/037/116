Hi 

Did anyone receive an answer to this. I ant to connect
a Radio Shack (276-143) IR LED to the IR output and am wondering
what resistance to use.  Also, I saw a design in Mobile
Robots..Inspirition where they use two IR LED (one on each side)
and a IS1U60 receiver in the middle as a proximity detector.
Is this possible on the HB?  Can one connect two IR LED's 

to the HB and move the IS1U60 to the front of a bumber.

Thanks for any advice

Mike Howard
