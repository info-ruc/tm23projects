To all:

  I am constructing the Handy Board from 'scratch', since many places want
upwards of $200 for a built (and tested) board.  I have located most of
the required parts, but have not located the following:

	the 1 uH iron core inductor
 	the 5W 47ohm resistor
 	the resistor networks -- isolated or common?
	piezo beeper
	32k static ram  --  62256-100lp  (I have Hyundai HY62256alp-10)
					 (eqivalent?)
	74HC138
	DS1233-10 voltage monitor
	IS1U60 infrared demodulator
	
  All other bases I think I have covered.  I looked for these w/ DigiKey
and Jameco.  looked briefly on mouser but didn't have all I was looking
for and abhorred the $20 min order.

  Any information or help would be greatly appreciated!

Guy
