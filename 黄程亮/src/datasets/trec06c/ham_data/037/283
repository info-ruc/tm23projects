Hi, everyone.  I was wondering if somebody could help me.
I am trying to control a 2 phase bipolar stepper motor.
I found a web page at :
http://laguna.fmedic.unam.mx/~daniel/handy_bipolar.html
that talks about controlling bipolar stepper motors.  But I just can't seem
to make it work.
When I use the code from the page the motors just vibrates, move forward,
backward and stop.

The stepper motors have four wires.  Brown +A, Red -A, Blue +B, Yellow -B.
I connect them on the HB motor header:  Brown, Skip,Red,Blue,Skip,Yellow

With the stepper motors I received a paper that says:
    Step        +A        +B        -A        -B
        1            +          +           -           -
        2            -           +          +           -
        3            -            -          +           +
        4            +           -          -            +
        5            +          +          -            -

I was not sure how to read this, but hey whats the worst that could
happened.I wrote a small program trying to interpret this:
    void Stepper(void);
        int intSteps=30;
        int intStep;
        long lngDelay = 5L;
        for (intStep = 0; intStep < intSteps; intStep++)    {
            /* step 1 */
            fd(0);
            fd(1);
            msleep(lngDelay);
            /* step 2 */
            fd(1);
            bk(0);
            msleep(lngDelay);
            /* step 3 */
            bk(0);
            bk(1);
            msleep(lngDelay);
            /* step 4 */
            fd(0);
            bk(1);
            msleep(lngDelay);
            /* step 5 */
            fd(0);
            fd(1);
            }
    ao();
}
The program does not work.  The stepper motor does the same thing, it
varibrates, moves forward a little, moves back a little and stops.

If anybody could help me, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks
