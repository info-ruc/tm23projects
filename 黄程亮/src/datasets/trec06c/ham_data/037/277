I want to disconnect interactive C from the handy board and send
instructions to it via the hyper terminal on Windows 95.  I have
followed the instructions given in the HB technical reference.  I am
confused as to the procedure for accomplishing my task.  Once the code
for receiving Characters is downloaded  to the handy board what is my
next step.  When do I call the disable_pcode_serial() function and how
do I utilize the serial_getchar(int c)?

These are the steps that I have tried:
   1.  download given code on last page of manual.
   2.  call disable_pcode_serial()
   3. turn off IC.
   4.  run hyper terminal,  which connects to the HB through com port 2.
As soon as I type in the hyper terminal the HB
        heart beat stops.


I'm not using the serial_getchar(int c) command correctly can someone
inform me of my blunder.  

Thanks,
Casey
