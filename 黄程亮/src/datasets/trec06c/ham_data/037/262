Subject: Polaroid sonar problems

hi!

Our group is still struggling with the polaroid sonar. We can't get any
coherent reading, only readings that are in the range 470-515, which
aren't effected by the measured distance.
We have the capacitor and resistor installed as required.
We tried using a 150ms delay (instead of 50) and we average our
readings, we tried taking every tenth reading and displaying it, but
nothing seems to work.
We know there are people out there who have succeeded! PLEASE, tell us
what you did.
Thanks.
    Guy.
