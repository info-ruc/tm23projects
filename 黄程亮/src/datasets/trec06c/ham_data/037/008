Kathy,
	Digi-Key has three kinds.  The first two look like the "Mobile Robots" type:

	QRB1114QT-ND	$1.58
	QRB1134QT-ND	$2.83

	The third one looks like a much more compact arrangement:

	QRD1114QT-ND	$1.50

	These are on Page 552 of the January-March catalog. Or you can hit the web
page at www.digikey.com.

Hope this helps,
Pherd
