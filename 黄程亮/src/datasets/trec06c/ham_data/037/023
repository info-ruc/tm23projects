I am thinking of putting a wireless board-level color or B&W camera
on my Mobot and I have a question for all the techies.  Is it 
possible to use one of the different outputs on the HB to interface 
with the camera to put diagrams on the live picture? I want to to put 
things like x,y ,light level, collision on which side & intruder 
etc..  In short I want to be able to watch the monitor and have 
something similar to a video game display.  I don't know if anybody 
has tried this or if even possible but I think it's a great idea. I 
am building this as a project for me and my young son and I want this 
thing to be as cool as possible.  Please help!!

Any suggestions would be appreciated.
Thanxs In advance.
STEVE
