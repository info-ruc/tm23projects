I had intended the two types of interfaces for different purposes, but, I
assume RF does not need line of site work.  R/C cars for example can be
controlled from several rooms away in my house (worked with one on a
telepresence implementation).  I assume this is the same type of modulation
the Linx units would use.  I have also worked with using a laptop and a
wireless Ethernet card to communicate back to another workstation.  This
worked well, and the transmissions would pass through walls, floors, and
ceilings.  However, I have yet to build a robot base that is suitable to
accommodate the laptop system, batteries and such.

I heard that radio waves do not need "line-of-sight" like IR does.  Can 
someone with more exerience verify or dispute this?  It makes sense since 
longer wavelengths of EMR can bounce off surfaces easier.  So maybe your 
Lynx device is better.
