Been there, done that! Funny. I bought almost all the same stuff from my local shack. Writting the software was the easy part ;^).

I've supplied some power to the inverter, yes. I'm assuming it's mandatory to have the inverter actually work. Otherwise how do you expect to invert a zero signal? It need some power from somewhere...

If I remember correctly it took me a while fiddling with the variable resistance before having the receiver getting a signal. I then put some hot glue on it to seal it and I haven't changed it since.

My version is working but is *way* too sensible: it detect an obstacle from at least a couple of meters away ;^). I tried changing the two resistances controlling the LED output to something bigger to limit the current going to the LEDs with no noticable changes in detection range. Any suggestion to get this thing less sensible would be appreciated.

Hey man, it's not that basic for me. I'm a software guy, so take all my hardware advices with a grain of salt ;^)
