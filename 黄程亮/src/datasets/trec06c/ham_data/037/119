I was able to follow the parts list and get most of the things from the suggested supplier.

I thought that I got the memory from Jameco, but I think BG-Micro sells it was well.


I would also think they both might carry 74HC138, certainly Digi-Key and Mouser  should have the 74hc138

I got this from Dallas Semiconductor. With shipping it cost around $5.00. I was also able to get it from Allied, but they have a $50.00 minimum. Allied had by far the best prices. At the time I did the handyboard, I was also working on a minboard, so I bought a few 68hc11. Both A and E. I did not find them until after buying most of the hard to find parts. I wish I had purchased the LCD from them.

I don't remember where I got this, but it was before I found Allied.

Mouser does not have a minimum, the other 2 do. I really like buying from Mouser as well. They are the place a buy from when I have small orders.
