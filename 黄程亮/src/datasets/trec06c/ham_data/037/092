Greetings all!
    I just got the kit for the expansion board in the mail, and I
realized something:  I modified my handy board to accept external power
for the motors through the power expansion header, using the
instructions at:
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/mods/hbmcut.html

    and now I don't know what to do because the expansion board uses
that header for power, and I'd like to continue using an external
battery to power my motors.  Does anybody have any advice?
