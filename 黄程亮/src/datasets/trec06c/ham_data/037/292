I also found that my neon light in my magnifying lens lamp caused erroneous
readings.  When I turned it off or moved it away the readings normalized
(gave the correct results).  Shielding wasn't effective in this instance.

I did completely away with the ribbon cable supplied with the sonar kit.  I
installed 9-pin D connectors at each end and ran shielded 4 pair cable
between the HB and the sonar board.

I provided a separate power supply for the sonar system (4 - 1.2 volt
cadmium) and located it close to the actual sonar.  Thus eliminating the
high current pulse and resultant magnetic field through the 4 pair cable.

Hope this helps.
