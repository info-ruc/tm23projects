So, it seems like the short answer to this question is no one knows what to
attach to correctly and safely (to prevent HB damage) allow IR transmissions
from the HB :)  I understand the receiving capabilities, as they are
documented and have routines and explanations enhanced by Max Davies.
However, there does not appear to be ANY documentation on how to install the
transmission circuit addition.  The HB reference manual indicates that it is
not included in the default handboard construction, but should be documented
elsewhere in the documentation or online.  I have yet find where that source
is.  Perhaps the 6.270 documentation locations have some info on it. 

On a seperate followup to the RF issues, it would seem (from my limited
knowledge) that one of the LinxTechnologies units would only need the serial
pin output to successfully send data from the HB to the interface/charger
board.  I would guess if a large data stream was to be sent some type of
handshaking/negotiation might need to be implemented, but if I just wanted
to send a few bytes at a time as control signals, it should be an easy
implementation.  Has anyone proceeded with more reserach into these RF
units?

Todd

Is the IR reciever on the HB the same thing as in the robot in MR:ITI book?
I though it would be different.

In any case, you can but...the reciever is more effective as a "wireless 
communication" device that can recieve various IR codes which you 
programm the HB to recognize.

You can buy a separate a demodulator for this purpose for pretty cheap.  
It is designed to recognize one frequency of IR code.  It should also 
have an LED driver that pulses the LED at the specific frequency.  You 
can buy one unit at radio shack or so.  It beats programming the HB and 
moving the part, etc.

But I guess it depends on what you really want to do.
