Hi all,

Lately, there have been a few questions on wireless communication between a
handyboard and a PC. I knew Jan Sipke van der Veen had designed a something
that would do just that, but I found his homepage was removed - he graduaded
from university. Fortunately, he has found another place to show his design.

His scematics are now on:

I am asking him about software for the things found there.
