Try connecting a 4.7K pull up resistor to VCC on the ECHO pin before the
diode.
the echo pin is open collector and pull up is provided by the handy
board digital input when used as described in the handy board
instruction.  When you add the diode
this no longer works because the echo pin is no longer pulled up to vcc.

P.S. let me know if it works
