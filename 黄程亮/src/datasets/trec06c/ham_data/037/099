To all:

  I am constructing my first Handy board.  I am currently building the
interface board, but have hit a small 'snag'.  While performing 'step 2',
installing capacitors and MAX232, and then testing, I did not recieve the
correct voltage outputs.  Any ideas?  I checked the capacitor polarity and
the MAX232 seems installed properly?  Perhaps a bad chip?  If so, can I
sub a MAX233 I have here in the lab?

Thanks,
  gms
