I certainly do!

Spent a lot of effort working developing a machine code interface for 
the Handyboard.
One of the biggest hurdles was getting messages to the LCD display.

If you look on the Handyboard home page, in the contributed section:

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/handy-board/software/c
ontrib.html

You will find assembly code to print to the LCD, and a link to my 
assembly programming system for the Handyboard.
