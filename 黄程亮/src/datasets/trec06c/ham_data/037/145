The software written by Max Davies should allow transmission as well as
receiving. The information that I have doesn't include the hardware
layout but as far as I understand the 1K resistor in the IR transmission
circuit on the board should allow an infrared LED to be connected
directly to the header connection (I may be wrong so any corrections
will be appreciated, Fred ?). I imagine that you would have to refer to
the specifications of the IR LED and the transistor driving it to find
out if you need to limit the current any further.
