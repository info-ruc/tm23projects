The Hamamatsu P3062-01 IR photoreflector mentioned in MR was discontinued and
replaced by the P5587.  This chip has the identical pinout and dimensions as
the original.  I
ordered several from Hamamatsu last year but they are pricey (~$7/ea) in small
quantities.
They are very thin (~1.7mm) and have a focal distance of about 3 mm.
You can check to see if they are still available at 908-231-0960.
