Chen,  

I am no expert on computer vision, but Greg Hager of Yale University's CS
dept. gave a talk at our school last week about developing function
libraries for visual tracking.  

His web page is <http://WWW.CS.Yale.EDU:8800/users/hager/>     

It seems relevant to what you are trying to do.  

Good luck.

Michael
