It is not the bouncing off of things but the passing through them that makes
RF able to operate without line of sight. Line of sight gives greater distances,
though, even with RF. The Lynx Tx/RX will definately have a greater range than
the IR.

Unless the object standing between an IR source and the IR receiver is IR transparent
(like glass is to the visible light spectrum), IR cannot pass through it which
makes it line-of sight. Most things are NOT IR transparent but many are. In
fact many optically opaque objects are IR transparent which can cause all kinds
of trouble if your aren't carefull.
