Is the IR reciever on the HB the same thing as in the robot in MR:ITI book?
I though it would be different.

In any case, you can but...the reciever is more effective as a "wireless 
communication" device that can recieve various IR codes which you 
programm the HB to recognize.

You can buy a separate a demodulator for this purpose for pretty cheap.  
It is designed to recognize one frequency of IR code.  It should also 
have an LED driver that pulses the LED at the specific frequency.  You 
can buy one unit at radio shack or so.  It beats programming the HB and 
moving the part, etc.

But I guess it depends on what you really want to do.
