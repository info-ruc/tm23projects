not knowing anything about the sensor, but guessing (hoping) that it
behaves like an open collector gate, this is what i would do--fool 
with the sensor on the bench to determine how it works before i 
let it near the HB.

1. power up the sensor, measure the voltage between output signal and
ground.  if there is an active output (0-12 v, say), you should be 
able to detect it--move some reflective thing near and away from the 
sensor.

2. if there is a voltage out > 5v, you could use an optoisolator, ensuring 
that the HB never gets more than 5v.  this should be easy since the 
HB has pullups tied to the inputs, but means an extra part.

3. if there is no signal out, add a pullup resistor from the signal to 
high.  now measure the range of output: it should be something like 
0 to whatever the high voltage is (0 = detect, high = no detect).  
if you use a 47k pullup to +5 v, you will see the range that the HB
sees, since the HB has 47k pullups to +5V.  if that range is ok, then
you should be ok to simply hook the signal to the appropriate input
on the HB.

hope this helps.
