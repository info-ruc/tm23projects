As part of the assignment for last week's class, you were supposed to come
up with ideas for "Mindstorms Jr." (programmable bricks for 5-6 year olds).

But I hope to set aside some time in a future class session, so please hold
onto your ideas -- and I hope that some of you will work on course projects
related to this theme.
