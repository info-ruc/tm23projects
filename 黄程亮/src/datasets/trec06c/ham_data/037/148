I am looking at the Schematic in the HB HP right now.  It looks like the 1K 
resistor is connected to the visible LED.

From the schematic, it looks like you can connect a resitor and IR LED in 
series to the "3-pin female header" to make your transmitter.

However, the value of your resistor...would depend on the specs of your 
LED and the transistor like John said.

The transistor should drop the voltage a little, but not enough to comply 
with the "maximum voltage allowable" for most IR LED's.  So use a 
resistor to be safe.   Hmmm...or perhaps it blinks so fast that it would 
not blow the LED?  I don't know.

If you need more range, you need to use more current and a more powerful 
IRLED.  In this case, what I would do is:

Put a more powerful transistor in parrallel to the ZTX614transitor and 
connect your resistor and IRLED's negative end to the new transistor 
instead of the pin on the header (which connects to old one).  Come to 
think of it...you can just replace the ZTX614!  That would be better if 
you don't mind desoldering.
