   So it turns out that MS Mincho is in character set 128 which like 
charset 132 is also a character set that Word's smart quote handling has to 
be off for it to be interpreted by DMDX.  Gotta wonder how many other font 
character sets are going to be breaking Word's lovely little 
"shortcuts".  DMDX 3.0.3.2 fixes this.
