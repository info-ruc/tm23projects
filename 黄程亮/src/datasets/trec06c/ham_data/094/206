From: Dr Joseph Tanko. ,
#6 Church Road,
Independence Avenue,
Jo' burg, 
South Africa.

With due respect and regards. I am the chairman of a
prime bank here in South Africa and personal account
officer to late ENGR.AUTHOR WOODROW. Until his death
he was the owner of GRAYSTONE DIAMOND COMPANY PTY
SOUTH AFRICA an industrialist and a foreigner, hence
the deceased have a floating account opened in the
bank in 1999 and before his death he has know WILL or
Heir apparent to the throne and no other one who know
about this fund because after his death his company
was liquidated by the management and during my stay
with, him his parent saws reported died in a plan
crash.

As a matter of fact this is a life given back to us to
make better use of it to assist the humanity. The
banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay
more than six years and it will be fortified for
nothing and be used by the top government officials to
suppress and subdue the poor masses in the society.

In view of all this I decided to seek for a reliable
and trustworthy foreigner who shall forward an
application to the bank as the next of kin so that the
fund will be approved in his or her fervor. The
request for a foreigner as a next of kin in this
matter is because of the fact that late Engr. Woodrow
is a foreigner and an African cannot stand as the next
of Kin to a foreigner, but could only be approved to
any foreigner with valid international passport since
the former owner of the account is a foreigner too,
thus the money could only be approved into a foreign
account. This is a matter of trust and if you assured
me that you will remain honest to me until we share
this fund accordingly as the bank management will
welcome any foreigner who has information about this
fund which I will give to you.

To prove the authenticity and legality of this
transfer, we are going to follow a due process of
transfer for onward transfer of this money to your
account with appropriate clearance from the relevant
ministries, foreign exchange departments and Board of
Internal Revenue Services to avoid any TAX from your
government need your strong assurance that you will
never let me down. I have strong contact with top
official of the ministry of finance to ensure smooth
transfer of the funds because you know that this
involves a large sum of money one person can not do
transfer alone and with your full cooperation we will
achieve this opportunity.

The total amount involved is Seventeen Million Two
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
($17,200,000.00) only. 

We will start the first transfer ($7,200,000,00) After
this first transfer without any let down from your
side b/c you know that this opportunity requires great
trust and confidentiality as you know that no business
survive without secrecy, we will be together in your
country to transfer the remaining balance ($10m) 

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount,60% will be for me and my
co-partner, while 5% will be for expenses both parties
might have incurred during the transfer process. 

I look forward to your earliest reply for further
correspondence. 

Regards,

Dr.Joseph Tanko.
