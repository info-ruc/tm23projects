   Multiple text segments means that DMDX found something like the following:

   +1 / "frame 1" / "frame 2" "second text segment" / "frame 3"  *;

   It usually occurs because there's a missing frame delimiter and the item 
should look like:

   +1 / "frame 1" / "frame 2" / "second text segment is now frame 3" / 
"frame 4"  *;

   Shouldn't be any particularly big deal, it's been done before.  You 
might want to make sure you're using the latest DMDX though as there have 
been a couple of fixes to handle Asian weirdnesses to do with smart quotes 
and the VOX test.

   %0 frames are fine, often it's easier to use the comma frame delimiter 
instead though.  For instance the following item can be re-written:

+1 / "frame 1" / %0 "frame 2" / ! "frame 3"  *;

   With a comma frame separator it becomes:

+1 / "frame 1" / "frame 2" , "frame 3"  *;
