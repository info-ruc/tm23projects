I've edited your post to remove your email address to avoid attracting more spam.

If you're somewhat technical, you probably could have filtered the spam  based on X-Spam-Blacklist-Warning or X-Spam-Status headers. I would like to make this more accessible to non-technical users this summer.

General FAQ:

It's reasonable to be unhappy about the sheer volume of material pouring
into our mailboxes. It's natural to want to fight back somehow, but this
isn't necessarily the best thing to do.

The primary argument against bulk email is the amount of time it takes away
from legitimate pursuits. Starting from there, it doesn't make sense to
spend a lot of time forwarding copies of bulk email to others.

Increasingly, not only are the sender and recipient information in the
message forged, but the intervening headers and URLs are forged or
obscured as well. Even with access to the mail server log information, it's
often difficult to determine the true origin of an email message. And
Brandeis gets approximately 30,000 unsolicited email messages every day.

Sending complaints without full, accurate header information and a thorough
understanding of what the data means does in fact waste your time and the
time of the people who receive your message.

If you wish to become an expert on unsolicited bulk email, you need to
read and fully understand every bit of http://go.brandeis.edu/spam and
http://my.brandeis.edu/bboard/q-and-a-search?topic_id=21&query_string=spam

Unless you are an expert, please do not forward junk email to anyone. Just
delete it. ITS has ways of collecting junk email automatically. There is
seldom anything to be gained by adding to the deluge yourself.

We *do* need to know *immediately* at postmaster@brandeis if junk email
controls reject a legitimate email. We always give specific reasons for the
rejection. Include the full text in reports to postmaster.
