   This usually occurs because someone was using scrambling in an item file 
and later on builds a new item file out of the old one and no longer uses 
scrambling.  The dollar symbols get left behind because scramble is no 
longer removing them and do exactly what you describe.  You however want 
scrambling so the logical inference is that you have not included any 
scrambling parameters so scrambling isn't taking place so the dollar 
symbols are left to cause syntax errors.  You need an S parameter.

   That's just the icon.  When Office installs it declares .RTF files to be 
it's own so the OS uses the Office icon.  In the explorer use Tools / 
Folder Options / View and un-check Hide Extensions for Known File 
Types.  Then you can see what a file's extension really is instead of only 
what the OS thinks is good for you like some damned macintosh.
