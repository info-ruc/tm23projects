   No.  I recommend it in fact.

   No, the capacitance of a piece of wire that long only affects signals in 
the multi-kilohertz range, RTs fall well below this.

   The biggest source of error is going to be the USB mouse itself and the 
only way to determine that is to build a test jig that closes the switches 
at a known frequency and to use DMDX's test modes to measure the variability.
