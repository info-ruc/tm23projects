Re: Course Packet Reminder 
Dear Professor:

Please note, we have a new e-mail address. We can now be reached at 
thecopyshop@qwest.net.

Summer Term 2004 is rapidly approaching. Classes start June 21th. We at the 
Copy Shop would like to remind the professors who use our packet production 
services that it is time to begin the copyright permissions process for Course 
Packets. For those instructors who are new to the University, or are planning 
their first course packet, we offer a hassle-free alternative to the 
University's system for producing course readers. We assure that permissions are obtained 
on all copyright articles and provide fast and inexpensive printing as well 
as several binding options for your packet. Just follow the easy steps below to 
begin processing your course packet with us.

1. Put together a bibliography of your reader. Include Book/Journal Title, 
Author/Editor, Article/Chapter Title, Publishing Company, Year Published, 
ISBN/ISSN Number, and page numbers. 

2. FAX, e-mail, or deliver a copy of your bibliography to; The Copy Shop, 539 
E.13th Ave, Eugene, OR 97401, (541)485-6253, thecopyshop@qwest.net.

3. Bring us your originals and we will make master copies to produce each 
course packet from. No need for you to spend hours standing over the copiers!

4. When permissions have been obtained, we will contact you with a total cost 
in copyright fees and let you decide if there are articles you wish to remove 
before we print the packet. We will not begin production until you have given 
us the final okay to do so.

Some articles may be denied. This usually occurs when the source is from an 
anthology it was not originally published in, or when the publishing company no 
longer holds the rights. We will notify you by e-mail or phone when there are 
difficulties obtaining permission. Also, the earlier we can begin obtaining 
copyright permissions the more likely we can include all the articles you wish 
to have in your packet. Some publishing companies can take up to three months 
to respond to our requests, though most respond within two or three weeks. 
Please give us your materials two weeks before the first day of class to work on 
the copyright clearances and making your packet originals. If you have any 
questions please call, write us, or come by the Copy Shop. Have a wonderful term.
Sincerely,
Erica
