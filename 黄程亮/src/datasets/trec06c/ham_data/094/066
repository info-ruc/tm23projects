Nahoko,

There isn't anything special about displaying more than 4 Chinese
characters.  At a guess, I'd say that you must have something like the
following in your item:

+001  "每组中" "文词出现以前"  etc.

That is, more than one set of quotation marks within a frame.  That's why
DMDX is suggesting a missing frame delimiter.

The following is one way you can do S/D matching:

+001 "每组中文词出现以前" %140 / !* <ln 1> "每组中文词出现以前";

Note that the "%140" builds in a delay before the second comparison stimulus
is presented.  This gives the subject time to read the first sentence and to
get ready for the second.  The "!" in the second frame prevents the first
from being erased.  Also, the entire display stays on the screen until the
subject responds (or the timeout is reached).

--k.i.f.
