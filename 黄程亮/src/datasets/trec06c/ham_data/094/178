   It's probably a problem with your item's structure, you'll have to post 
a couple of them so we can see what you're doing.  Beyond that you're 
probably going to have to be mapping a request and or positive response key 
as DMDX isn't likely to know the name of your keyboard's keys -- that or 
use the #keyboard device that knows keys by their numerical ids and works 
for all nationalities.
