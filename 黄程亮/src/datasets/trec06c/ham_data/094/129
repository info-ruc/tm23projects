   I'd say your attempt to configure the card failed.  As I recall it's 
super terse stuff like having to a zero in a channel's configuration if 
it's to be output and a 1 for input (or the other way around, I can't 
recall).  Maybe you've got to restart the machine after configuring it, 
nothing that the Keithley software does surprises me except that it can be 
made to work.

In the beginning was the word.
But by the time the second word was added to it,
there was trouble.
For with it came syntax ...
