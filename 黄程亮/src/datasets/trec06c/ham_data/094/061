Hi Nahoko
 
I don't know the answer to your question, but just wanted to say that I saw your message. I am also a student (PhD) of Claudia Felser, and I am planning to run a lexical decision experiment on DMDX. I shall be getting into some 'serious programming' over the next couple of weeks, so perhaps we could help each other out.
 
One tip is to look at the website of the MRC-CBU in Cambridge. They have a number of programs that you can copy, then cut and paste the bits you need. I set up a simple lexical decision task in less than an hour that way. If you need more precise references, let me know.

please let me know.
Also, if someone has a format for Sentence Matching, I would appriciate
if I could take a look. (Mine uses
