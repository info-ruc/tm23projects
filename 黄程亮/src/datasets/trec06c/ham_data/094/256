Hi,

We are experiencing problems with our Keithley PCMCIA PIO
cards on our new laptops. The OS is Win2000 and I'm
using the latest versions of DMDX, TimeDX and DirectX.
DMDX and TimeDX have always worked just fine on
desktop machines, which are also equiped with a Keithley card
and also run Win2000.

The difference is that if I go into the DriverLinx Configuration
Panel, on my desktop machine only one driver shows up.
On the laptops 3 drivers appear! Only one of these is the
correct one (i.e. the PCMCIA PIO24) the others are inactive
but can't be removed. I've installed the usual device in
DriverLinx on the correct driver, and it all seems to work
fine in TimeDX.

One thing that you have to do, though, is to select the correct
driver from the list of 3 every time you start TimeDX.  If I
do that all is fine in TimeDX.

However, the real problems occur when we start DMDX. It also
asks the user to select the correct driver at the beginning of the
program, but then asks this question again and again when
you try to run, or 'syntax test' a script. Very quickly things
go really wrong and DMDX crashes and has to be stopped
using the Windows task manager.

I have checked the registry settings, and can confirm that
TimeDX is saving a record of which PIO driver and device should
be used. However, it seems that DMDX keeps asking you to
chose a driver and ignores the registry setting.

Does anyone know what is going on, and how to fix it? We
need to get these machines working urgently and would
really appreciate any suggestions.

Thanks,

Maarten
