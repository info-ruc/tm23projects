Multiple Vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Components and Outlook Express

   Original release date: July 14, 2004
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT

Systems Affected

     * Microsoft Windows Systems

Overview

   Microsoft has released a Security Bulletin Summary for July, 2004.
   This summary includes several bulletins that address vulnerabilities
   in various Windows applications and components. Exploitation of some
   vulnerabilities can result in the remote execution of arbitrary code
   by a remote attacker. Details of the vulnerabilities and their impacts
   are provided below.

I. Description

   The table below provides a reference between Microsoft's Security
   Bulletins and the related US-CERT Vulnerability Notes. More
   information related to the vulnerabilities is available in these
   documents.

   _________________________________________________________________

   Format:
 
   Microsoft Security Bulletin 

   Related US-CERT Vulnerability Note(s)
   _________________________________________________________________

   MS04-024: Vulnerability in Windows Shell Could Allow Remote Code
   Execution (839645) 

   VU#106324 Microsoft Windows contains a
   vulnerability in the way the Windows Shell launches applications
   _________________________________________________________________
   
   MS04-023: Vulnerability in HTML Help Could Allow Code Execution
   (840315) 

   VU#187196 Microsoft Windows fails to properly process
   showHelp URLs

   VU#920060 Microsoft Windows HTML Help component fails to properly
   validate input data

   MS04-022: Vulnerability in Task Scheduler Could Allow Code Execution
   (841873) 

   VU#228028 Microsoft Windows Task Scheduler Buffer Overflow
   _________________________________________________________________

   MS04-021: Security Update for IIS 4.0 (841373) 

   VU#717748 Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0 contains a 
   buffer overflow in the redirect function
   _________________________________________________________________
    
   MS04-020: Vulnerability in POSIX Could Allow Code Execution (841872)
   
   VU#647436 Microsoft Windows contains a buffer overflow in the POSIX
   subsystem
   _________________________________________________________________
   
   MS04-019: Vulnerability in Utility Manager Could Allow Code Execution
   (842526) 

   VU#868580 Microsoft Windows Utility Manager launches applications with 
   system privileges
   _________________________________________________________________
  
   MS04-018: Cumulative Security Update for Outlook Express (823353)

   VU#869640 Microsoft Outlook Express fails to properly validate
   malformed e-mail headers
   _________________________________________________________________

II. Impact

   A remote, unauthenticated attacker may exploit VU#717748 to execute
   arbitrary code on an IIS 4.0 system.

   Exploitation of VU#106324, VU#187196, VU#920060, and VU#228028, would
   permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
   of the current user. The attacker would have to convince a victim to
   view an HTML document (web page, HTML email) or click on a crafted URI
   link.

   Vulnerabilities described in VU#647436 and VU#868580 permit a local
   user to gain elevated privileges on the local system.

   Exploitation of VU#869640 can lead to a denial-of-service condition
   against Outlook Express.

III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Microsoft has provided the patches for these vulnerabilities in the
   Security Bulletins and on Windows Update.

Do not follow unsolicited links

   It is generally a good practice not to click on unsolicited URLs
   received in email, instant messages, web forums, or Internet relay
   chat (IRC) channels. However, this practice does not always prevent
   exploitation of these types vulnerabilities. For example, a trusted
   web site could be compromised and modified to deliver exploit script
   to unsuspecting clients.

Maintain updated anti-virus software

   Anti-virus software with updated virus definitions may identify and
   prevent some exploit attempts, but variations of exploits or attack
   vectors may not be detected. Do not rely solely on anti-virus software
   to defend against these vulnerabilities. More information about
   viruses and anti-virus vendors is available on the US-CERT Computer
   Virus Resources page.

Appendix A. Vendor Information

   Specific information about these issue are available in the Security
   Bulletin Summary for July, 2004 and the US-CERT Vulnerability Notes.
