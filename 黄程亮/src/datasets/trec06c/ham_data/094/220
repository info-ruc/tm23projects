Dr. Phillips,

I want to introduce our company, Advanced Clustering Technologies, to
you.  We design and deliver high performance computing solutions
(Beowulf clusters) that are being used in areas such as bio-informatics
applications (Institute for Systems Biology and Washington University -
St. Louis ), visualization (Purdue University and Indiana University),
weather prediction (SAIC, NOAA),  and improving lithium battery
performance (Argonne National Laboratory).  Through a detailed interview
process Advanced Clustering tailors each turnkey solution to match it to
the specific task it will be performing.

We currently partner with many universities and government entities
(such as NASA, NOAA, several National Labs, Rose Hulman Institute of
Technology, Ohio Supercomputing Center, and Drexel University) and we
would like to see if we could put our talents together to help solve the
problems on which you are focusing your research.  In addition to
clusters, we also specialize in Linux-based workstations, file servers,
RAID arrays, high-speed interconnects, and power management.  We've also
developed a cluster management tool called Cognition that we debuted at
SuperComputing 2003 in Phoenix last November.  One of its features is an
environmental LCD on each node to monitor such things as cpu usage, cpu
temperature, fan speed,  IP addresses, and uptime.  These LCDs come with
directional keypads that allow you to cycle through these readings.  In
addition, Cognition allows you to monitor your overall cluster's
performance as well as individual nodes.  And this performance can be
monitored hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or  yearly.  This monitoring
includes those tools connected to the network, such as switches, and
power distribution units.

Our website is www.advancedclustering.com.  I hope you are able to visit
and I am confident you will find a fit for the important work you are
doing with the solutions we offer.

One final thing: we offer a free service that allows you to remotely
test your code.  You will have full remote access to various machines to
benchmark and run your code, and get the price/performance ratio for
which you are looking.  This feature, Test A Cluster
<XXXX://www.advancedclustering.com/clusters/?page=testcluster>, is
available on our website and is very popular with our governmental and
educational clients.  I will follow up with you in the next week or two
and get your feedback.  Again, thank you for your time.

Best regards,

Jim Paugh
