I'm leaning away from the electronics explanation because
1. The problem happens on two unrelated computers, and
2. It stopped happening when I used the particular sequence of parameters
    sent by Francois-Xavier Alario yesterday.

The problem still happens systematically with other settings, including 
those in the "naming" tutorial file (on Mike Ford's page).   The critical 
difference seems to lie with the optional parameter to RecordVocal, but I 
have not been able to figure out with certainty the conditions which make it 
work or not.

So I'd say that the documentation is incorrect in stating that no parameter 
means recording for the length of timeout, but it is correct in saying that 
adding a parameter may help overcome various recording problems (I can't 
remember where I read that, perhaps in the list archives, but I do remember 
that I tried some combinations before sending the request for help).

The decay is not slow and smooth, but neither is it a one-sample abrupt drop 
to zero (in fact it is not a drop to zero, it is a drop to background, which 
is extremely weird since there is no background but speech at that time.

If you're curious I can send you a minimal file that produces the problem 
consistently and a few audio files that come out of it.

PS.  Thank you very much, for helping with this problem, for writing and 
offering DMDX in the first place, and for maintaining and improving it over 
the years.
