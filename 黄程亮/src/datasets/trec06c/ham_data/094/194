I have made very good progress with DMDX (and I really appreciate all the effort that has gone into it developing and maintaining it), only to have a problem with something that should be routine.

I need to delimit my instructions, to facilitate scrambling. I have tried the $ delimiters in both positions shown in all the tutorials (between lines and at the beginning and end of lines). But the syntax checker keeps reporting "missing line number", ie the $ symbol is 'blocking' the line number somehow. I have followed up a couple of ideas from the archive, including the idea that it could be caused by an error in the parameters, but without any success.

I wonder if the problem might reside in Word rather than in DMDX. Every time I save my file in Wordpad, it emerges as a Word document (Office XP). If so, might there be a work-around that I could use, without the $ delimiters.

Anyone had a similar experience and know of a solution?
