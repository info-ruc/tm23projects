Hi,

Michael showed me part of your email about mod-p Galois
representations.

A while ago I looked at what is actually required for Kolyvagin's
method to apply at a prime p. It seems to apply when
the curve admits no p-isogenies (details below). Since this is fairly easy
to determine, there might be no need to use Serre's
criteria for deciding when the representation is GL(p).

Incidentally, your email gives a criterion that the rep'n is GL(p) for fixed
p,
which raises the question how one can, at one stroke, deal with all primes
larger
than some determined number. Serre posed this
as a question in his paper (noting that it would follow from his proof if
explicit Cebotarev was already known at the time). On the practical side,
for a given elliptic curve it seems one can do this fairly easily.
Serre also asks a uniform version of the question, in particular
for elliptic curves over Q, whether the rep'n is GL(p) for all primes p>=19.
Do we know the answer today?

Back to Kolyvagin's method... According to Gross'
account (which ignors the CM case) there are two
places where the assumption on p-torsion is used:

(1) In §4, in order for the construction to give
cohomology classes in H^1(K,E[p]), one needs that
the restriction map

H^1(K,E[p]) -> H^1(H_n,E[p])^K

is an isomorphism. Here H_n is the ring class field
of conductor n.

(2) In §9, in order to get one's hands on the Selmer
group, one wants H^1( K(E[p])/K , E[p] )=0. This was already
dealt with; in earlier email, someone explained that this fails
only when there is a p-isogeny (in which case it's easier to do p-descent).



I'll show that (1) is OK when E(K)[p]=0 for any p>3,
and also for p=3 assuming that K is not Q(mu_3).
It suffices to show
H^1(H_n/K , E[p](H_n) ) = 0  and
H^2(H_n/K , E[p](H_n) ) = 0.
As in the earlier email, one can use the trick involving
a nonidentity scalar.


Proof:
Gal(H_n/K) is abelian, so we may write it as a
direct sum P+P', where P has p-power order and
P' is prime to p.

CLAIM: The subgroup of E[p](H_n) invariant under P'
is trivial.

To see this, let G be the quotient of Gal(H_n/K)
giving the action on E[p](H_n). If #G is prime to p,
we are done, since in that case P' maps onto G.
Otherwise, #E[p](H_n)=p^2 and G contains the subgroup
( 1 * )
( 0 1 )
in some basis. Since G is abelian, it is contained in
the normaliser of this subgroup, which is the set of
matrices of the form
( a b )
( 0 a )
Moreover, G must contain an element with a\=1; indeed
det(G) is the cyclotomic character and deg(K/Q)=2,
so all the squares in F_p must be values of det(G), which
gives us an a\=1 assuming p>3. By lifting our element a to P',
we get an element which acts on E[p] as a nontrivial scalar,
proving the claim for p>3.

When p=3, the case #E[p](H_n)=p^2 is impossible:
by assumption K is not Q(mu_3),
which means that det(G) takes all nonzero values in F_p.
But that is not possible if G has the above form.


The subgroup P' < Gal(H_n/K) gives us the exact sequence

0 -> H^1( P , E[p](H_n)^P' ) -> H^1( H_n/K , E[p](H_n) )
   -> H^1( P' , E[p](H_n) ) .

The first H^1 vanishes because E[p](H_n)^P' = 0, and the
last H^1 vanishes because the order of P' is prime to p.
Therefore the middle H^1 vanishes, as required.
Furthermore, since the last H^1 vanishes, we have the same
sequence with H^2 in place of H^1. Again, all three terms
vanish, for the same reasons as before.



Remark: I guess we have a lot of freedom to choose K.
So that if E(Q)[p]=0, we can choose K such that E(K)[p]=0,
and also K \= Q(mu_3).
