Where or how can I find the GeForce video cards shortcut?   nj


   It performs other tasks adequately?  First suspect is always a virus
or 
worm.  You could try the DMDX for GeForce video cards shortcut (even if 
it's not a GeForce) or the DMDX for really bad video cards shortcut and
see 
if that fixes things.  I guess it's faintly possible that the machine
has a 
small amount of RAM and if it's a cheap machine it's using main memory
for 
video memory and when DMDX asks for it's ridiculous number of back
buffers 
that the machine starts running out of swap space which would slow
things 
down right good and proper.  After that it's the display drivers and so
on, 
you find out what the video chipset is and get new drivers for it.
