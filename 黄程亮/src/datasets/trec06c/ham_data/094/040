Hi all,

I am trying to run an azk file through analyze version 2.02 and I get the 
following error message.

"Item file has 0 non-instruction item numbers"

I have written a spc file (using Nan Jiang's help files as a guide) and 
can't see anything obviously wrong with it.  Does anyone have any 
suggestions.

Thanks
Emma
