Hi folks,

I'm potentially interested in running a series of experiments that 
involve people making responses on a touchscreen monitor. This is a 
function that Jonathan hasn't yet had need to develop, but I believe 
he'd be happy to do so if appropriate sponsorship could be found.

I believe that other DMDX users have mentioned that such a facility 
would be useful. As anyone needing this sort of functionality would 
otherwise have to fork out the money for a commercial package such as 
'Presentation', I was wondering whether there might be a few labs around 
the world who would consider jointly sponsoring such a code change, 
perhaps for particular research projects. If there were a few interested 
parties, then the individual contribution could be less than a one-year 
licence for 'Presentation'...

If anyone's potentially interested, please email me direct 
(s.bell@psychol.cam.ac.uk) rather than the list.

Thanks,
Stuart.
