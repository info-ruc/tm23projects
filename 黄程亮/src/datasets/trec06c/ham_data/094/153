   I'd be tempted to say that the only error DMDX could make and certainly 
the only errors I've seen it make as I've been correcting it's code is a 
sudden immediate over one sample drop off of the vocalization.  Anything 
that's decaying over time almost has to be some part of the electronics of 
your systems.
