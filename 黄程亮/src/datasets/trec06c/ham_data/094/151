Precedence: list

I played randomly with the settings of record vocal and digitalvox (see
help on these keywords and help on audio input) to get rid of a similar
yet different problem (my responses were cut in the middle: DMDX sticked
together the beggining and end of the words. "constitution" would sound
"condchion")

what I use now is:

<InputDevice DigitalVOX>
<InputDevice "RecordVocal" 1200>
<InputDevice "clavier">
<MapRequest +espace>
<MapPositiveResponse +DigitalVox>
<Timeout 2000>

in that order
and it works on my desktop...
