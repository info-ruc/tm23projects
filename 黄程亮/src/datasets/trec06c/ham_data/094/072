   Yes, DMDX's diagnostics contain two alternate names for any input device 
that can be used.  Sometimes there are special characters that don't print 
in TimeDX's display so DMDX provides a stripped down version as well -- but 
you have to look at the diagnostic window or diagnostics.txt to see what 
the name might be.

   If it wasn't so warm out today, it would be cooler.
