Hi All,

I need to play a continuous auditory wav file for 6 seconds, with a 500 ms
startle probe (also a wav file) interrupting the first file at 3 seconds,
after which the 6 second file file needs to continue playing.  Is there a
way to do this without breaking the 6 second file into two separate 3
second chunks?  For instance, can I overlay the two sounds and have them
play simultaneously?

Thanks,

tammy
