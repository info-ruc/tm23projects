   Yeah, the problem centers around the fact that video is rendered in a 
completely different fashion (namely real time) so DMDX has to shift gears 
just before the video is rendered and it has to make sure that none of the 
previous display buffers come back to haunt the rendered video -- and the 
easiest way to do that is to just blit black everywhere.  To fix it DMDX 
would have to start figuring out what was on the screen, where the video is 
going to be rendered and a bunch of other messy stuff.

   Stability itself is nothing else than a more sluggish motion.
