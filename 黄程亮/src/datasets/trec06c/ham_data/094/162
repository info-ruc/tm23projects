   Yeah, the big effort in the most recent re-write of that code was to 
make variable length recording buffers work and after that was working I 
then went back and made classic mode fixed length recording work.  So a 
_lot_ more effort went into making the new stuff work as no one was 
interested in the classic mode and it's possible that classic mode works on 
my machines and no one else's.
