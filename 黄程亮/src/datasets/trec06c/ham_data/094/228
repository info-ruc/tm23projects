A pretty labour intensive way of getting around your problem is to let
DMDX display your video a rapid series of images (as in, you would have
to use a program, perhaps adobe premiere, to extract the frames of your
video, and save them as individual images, and let DMDX display these
images).  If you are showing pretty small videos, it might be worth the
effort. Andy.

   It won't happen till some pretty serious code gets re-written in
DMDX.
