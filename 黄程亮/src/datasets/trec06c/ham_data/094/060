Hallo,
I am a master's student at University of Essex. I am planning to conduct
Sentence Matching Experiment in Japanese,
And have problems in displaying a long sentence containing several
Chinese characters (Hiragana and Katakana are okey to be displayed).
When the string of Chinese characters are more than 4, the error message
"frame has multiple test segment, possible missing frame delimeter".
If someone knows how to display long sentences in Chinese chracter,
please let me know.
Also, if someone has a format for Sentence Matching, I would appriciate
if I could take a look. (Mine uses <% 0>, maybe not a good idea).
