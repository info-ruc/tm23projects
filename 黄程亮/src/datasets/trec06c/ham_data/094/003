   Does anyone have a really strong vested interest in me not changing the 
expression evaluator for counters?  After several days of futzing with the 
current algorithm I've come to the conclusion that it's never going to 
handle parenthesis correctly, the design is busted.  Knowing as much as I 
now do about expression parsers it's within the realm of possibility that 
I'll re-write the parenthesis handling but more than likely I'll toss Bob's 
code and use someone else's, even if it is a bunch of work to reintegrate 
all the DMDX bits.
