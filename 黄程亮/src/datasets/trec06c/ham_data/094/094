Subject: [DMDX] running dmdx on a Chinese brand computer

I am trying to install dmdx on a relatively new computer on a Chinese
campus that has Chinese environment (Chinese brand name). I did TimeDX.
But when I opened an item file (a working file I have used) and did the
syntax check, it was extremely slow. It usually takes only a few seconds
to finish checking the entire file, but each line took a few seconds.
When I ran the file, the computer freezed (or was just extremely slow).
Any help would be appreciated.
