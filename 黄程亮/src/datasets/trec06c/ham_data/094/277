Dear Colleague,

As you remember, we had invited you to send a paper
in the World Conference of WSEAS on APPLIED MATHEMATICS
in August 2004 in Corfu, Greece.


STATISTICS: WSEAS received approximately 600 papers,
from them, the organizing committee 
approved 420 papers for the conference proceedings
>From the 420 accepted papers, after further review, 200 papers
were promoted in the WSEAS and IASME Transactions


If you want to send a paper now, 
for this World Conference of Applied Mathematicians' world community
is too late
but we strongly recommend you the send your paper in the upcoming WSEAS events
