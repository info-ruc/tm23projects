   No.  Apart from the fact I would still appear to be just as far away as 
I ever was from receiving detailed technical specifications of what the eye 
tracking software would have to do it doesn't appear that the modifications 
needed for it would translate to other analog devices without a significant 
amount of extra work -- which means I'm not likely to do it unless it's 
needed here or is sponsored by others.

   Thanks.  That is in fact the only thing I've ever thought of to do with 
the devices beyond having multiple correct spots and other regions that are 
specifically negative responses and for the rest of the area to be 
optionally ignored.

Don't worry over what other people are thinking about you.  They're too
busy worrying over what you are thinking about them.
