   The only real timing difference between .zil and .azk is that a .zil 
item file will typically always use the timeout to terminate a response 
whereas .azk typically terminates when the subject responds.  Perhaps you 
should try the <zor> mode of .zil that only gathers a single response but 
otherwise keeps with the .zil conventions.  If this works I'd be looking at 
your handling of timeouts as it would indicate that a subject not 
responding in an .azk file would also cause the timing to go out.
