GOOD DAY!

My name is Mamadu Toure GUEI, the son and only surviving 
member of the of ex military/ex president of the Republic 
of Cote d'Ivoire. My late father led an
opposition to the present Government of COTE D`IVOIRE.

On the 19th September 2002 my father/mother including 
every members of our family was murdered by the unknown 
assasin which was supposedly sent my the president. During 
the time of the attack in our house by shooting
and looting,( even this is one of the things that 
contributed to the present crisis in our country today).

God so kind I was not in town when the incident occurred, 
the plans of the AGENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT, was to kill 
every members of our family so that no one will be left to 
tell or bear witness to what happened to us . but God 
works in a misterious way to preserve me.

I am in our country without any one knowing although Iam 
on hiding so that the unknown AGENTS will not get to me 
and kill me like they killed all the members of our 
family. The reason Why I still staying back in our country 
is to transfer the $9.5M USD which my late father 
deposited a bank here in Abidjan . I have all the 
necessary deposit documents with me and will be glad to 
send it to you if you accept to help so that we shall work 
out the best and safe possible means to transfer this 
money to your account . while you shall assist me to come 
over to your country to continue my education and for the 
investment of the money in any profitable business as you 
may choose .

As soon as I receive your return email indicating your 
interest to assist me I shall further update you with how 
this transaction can be completed within weeks.

I am waiting for your soonest response

Yours sincerely

Mamodu Toure Guei
