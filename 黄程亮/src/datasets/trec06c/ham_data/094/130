Jonathan -- blessings on sufficient cues: Your recall was enough to allow me to
correct the configuration. For those who may be using the KPCI-PIO24 boards
under XP, the requisite configuration is

Input: 
Channel 0, initialize with 1 (dec)
Channel 1, initialize with 1 (dec)
Channel 2, initialize with 0 (dec)

Output: 
Channel 0, initialize with 0 (dec)
Channel 1, initialize with 0 (dec)
Channel 2, initialize with 1 (dec)
