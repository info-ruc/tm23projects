Thank you for the helpful response. Unfortunately, we need DMDX to record 
all the responses made as the scanner pulse is measure as a response. Is 
there a way to make the zil terminate the trial once either of two keys are 
pressed, but still record all responses (so we know when the scanner pulses 
occur)?

Thank you for your help.

Best,
  Gregg
