   It performs other tasks adequately?  First suspect is always a virus or 
worm.  You could try the DMDX for GeForce video cards shortcut (even if 
it's not a GeForce) or the DMDX for really bad video cards shortcut and see 
if that fixes things.  I guess it's faintly possible that the machine has a 
small amount of RAM and if it's a cheap machine it's using main memory for 
video memory and when DMDX asks for it's ridiculous number of back buffers 
that the machine starts running out of swap space which would slow things 
down right good and proper.  After that it's the display drivers and so on, 
you find out what the video chipset is and get new drivers for it.
