Hi.  I am performing a speech production experiment and would like to use
voice input to not only record subjects' reaction times (and record
responses), but I would also like to send an output on the PIO12 board
immediately once the sound threshold has been crossed.  I wasn't able to
determine a way to do this in DMDX, but it seems that it might be possible.
Can anyone tell me if there's a way to do this mapping from input to output
during experiment runtime?

Thanks,
Jay Bohland
