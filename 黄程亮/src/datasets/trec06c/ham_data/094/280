SDO Weekly Report for July 9, 2004

The Sun is featured on the cover of the July 2004 issue of National
Geographic.  The article "Sun Bursts:  Hot News from our Stormy Star"
provides a great introduction to the kinds of science that SDO will do
and why it is so important!

The Project continues to struggle to maintain procurement schedules.
Project and Code 500 procurement personnel are working with the Project
to find ways to handle the large number of procurement actions that are
in process and in the queue.  SDO is competing for scarce Procurement
resources with several other high priority procurement activities; the
Project will explore whether SDO's priority at the Center can be
raised.  Some action is occurring, however.  Evaluation of the C&DH SBC
and HGAS Gimbal Actuator proposals are on-going. A Request for Offer
(RFO) is scheduled to be released on July 9 for the SDO Propulsion
System Propellant Tank. Presolicitation notice was released for the
Propulsion System Main Engine and Thruster RFOs. Request For
Informations (RFIs) were released for the ASC Star Tracker and Reaction
Wheel Assembly. RFI Responses were received for the ACS Inertial
Reference Unit.

Fabrication of the C&DH PSE ASD SDN Breadboard and the SPN PCC ETU
commenced. Routing of the SPN LPSC ETU continued. Layout continued for
the C&DH Ka Com Card, S Com Card, BMC, and DC/DC Breadboards.

Round two of Chesapeake Children's Museum display design is underway.
Text is being finalized and approved by Deputy Project Scientist Dean
Pesnell for scientific accuracy and design of the actual displays is
being carried out by Emilie Drobnes.  The display company, i.e. etc., is
responsible for coordination, fabrication, and instillation of the display.

Mission Assurance personnel continued to support the SDO Board Design
for Manufacturability Study activity, interfacing with the NASA and
Northrop Grumman (N/G) folks to push the strategy of the backplane
boards.  N/G delivered a plan to outline the various proposed
manufacturing processes and equipment to be utilized and started to map
out a sequence of test for the subject backplanes.  They are starting
with an Acceptability of Materials phase to look at the solderability of
the connector pins and PCB.  Thermal profiling will be performed on the
backplane to characterize the thermal properties of the board by
attaching thermocouples on the top and bottom of the board and at
different depths to determine internal plane connection effects.  Wave
soldering and solder fountain (via an Air-Vac Connector Rework Machine)
will be used as the preferred methods.  Vapor Phase, Resistance
Soldering and Hand Soldering will be the backup options.  Board and
parts procurement should have started this week.

LMSAL summarized recent efforts to improve the AIA thermal design and
address heater power growth; a new power goal was provided by the
project in advance of a thermal peer review later this month. Efforts
continue to minimize impacts to SAO long lead procurements caused by
delays in finalizing the Phase CDE contract.

The contract modification for consolidation of AIA CCDs, Camera
Electronics, and EEE parts under the HMI program has been sent to
Stanford for final signatures. LMSAL is currently working to modify the
Rutherford Appleton Laboratories contract as part of the consolidation
effort. Both LMSAL and SDO parts engineers visited the International
Rectifier (IR) plant to assess the IR DC/DC Converter as a replacement
for the VPT converter. As a result of the trip, AIA/HMI has decided to
use the IR converters where there is no impact to mass or power, but
reduce the overall number of DC/DC converters on the Common Buy list.
HMI will have a Peer Review on the Focal Plane Assembly next week with
GSFC participating. The Peer Review is in response to a Mission PDR RFA.
The start of SUROM testing will move one week due to additional work
needed on the bridgeboard development box, and the mechanism controller
board is in assembly. HMI will visit their structure subcontractor,
Vision Composites, for a technical interface meeting on July 16. A joint
AIA/HMI Interface Working Group has been scheduled for August 10, 11,
and 12, 2004 in Palo Alto, CA.

EVE presented a mass increase to 53.28 kg exceeding their allocation of
52.00 kg. The mass increase is due to the CCD package redesign,
electronics size increase and separation of the CEB radiator. Numerous
mass-saving approaches have been implemented and further ones are being
developed. EVE has not requested an increase in allocation at this time.
The life test unit CCD (Lessor processed) is on schedule for delivery
the week of July 19th. A new thermal vacuum chamber is in place for the
life testing and will be commissioned later this month. The life test
CCD will use camera and bench electronics delivered earlier this spring.

It was discovered that the TSI Front-End Processor (FEP) has a minimum
data rate of 50Mbps. This does not allow the TSI FEP to lock up on the
RF SOC Pn encoded data, which operates at 40Mbps. The DDS engineers are
working on developing a Convolutional encoder/viterbi decoder to allow
the RF SOC to operate at 50Mbps - 150Mbps.  The IN-SNEC FEP order has
been received and processed. IN-SNEC is awaiting for the authorization
to export from the French government. Expected delivery date of the FEP
is July 30.  The Ground System continues to working on detail designs.
