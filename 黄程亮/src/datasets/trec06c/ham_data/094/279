   Because this <ms# 2> moves with the following item during the first 
scramble.  You need to look at the second multi-scrambling example and use 
it's extra matching <ms# 2> keywords at the beginning and end of item

example.  Look at the intermediate files to get a clue of what's going 
where and when it does it.
