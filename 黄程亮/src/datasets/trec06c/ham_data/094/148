Dear DMDX users,

I have a consistent problem with DMDX both on my desktop (with Intel 82801
audio AC'97) and laptop PC (IBM T40).  Both run Windows 2000, recently
updated from Microsoft, including latest driver updates, and I have the
latest DMDX version. The problem also appears using the minimal "NAMING"
control file from Mike Ford's tutorial, so it's  probably not some stupid
mistake in my setting up the item file.  The problem is that the recording
stops registering the speech after a few (or a few hundred) milliseconds,
while the resulting audio file may in fact last much longer, containing very
low level noise for the rest of the duration.

In other words, the audio files from the experiment look like this: First,
"silence" background for RT number of milliseconds, then 5 up to 500
milliseconds (usually 50-250) of the spoken response, then rapid decay of
the speech waveform followed by several hundred milliseconds of "silence"
background identical to the file beginning.  The total length of the file is
much more than would be needed for RT+spoken reply, but typically less than
the <Timeout> constant.

The VOX settings are correct, in that the measured RTs seem reasonable and
correspond to the onset of speech in the audio file.  The length of the
well-registered speech signal and the total length of the file do not seem
to be governed by some consistent principle, although increasing the
"Timeout" does increase the average wav file length.   If someone has solved
this problem before I would greatly appreciate any pointers, before I run
the experiment with a portable tape recorder next to the laptop... :-)
