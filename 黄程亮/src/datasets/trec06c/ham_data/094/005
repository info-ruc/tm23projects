Hello everyone,=20

=20

=20

The Collaborative Community Committee met on April 1, 2004.  Attending =
were
Joanne Hansen, Chuck Fisk, Siamack Bondari, June Hammond; excused were
Father Michael Cooper, Ann Riedling, Mike Madagan, and Karen Hahn. =20

=20

After considering research into other colleges' and universities' =
calendars
(states of SC, PA, FL, TX, NY, NJ, GA, VA, MA), we voted to recommend =
that
the Fall 2005 semester start sooner:  International and new students =
would
arrive Monday 8/22, transfer students arrive and advising and =
registration
for them and new students on Tuesday 8/23, classes begin Wednesday 8/24.
Classes would be held on Labor Day.  Exams would end on Tuesday, 12/13.  =


=20

There are many reasons to support the revised fall schedule.  First, the
faculty are in meetings 8/16 (Senate), 8/17 (orientation and Community =
Day),
8/18 (Development Day and faculty meetings).  If department meetings =
(the
only thing scheduled for 8/19) were moved to 8/18, Friday the 19th could
then be used for advising (or even a last three day weekend off).  =
Classes
would begin on Wednesday 8/24.  As it is, faculty must report by the =
17th
but have nothing scheduled for most of the next week. This would be a =
more
efficient use of everyone's time.  Second, we would not end the semester =
so
close to Christmas.  This has several advantages, too.  Students who =
must
fly home (especially international students) would have many more flight
options than they would if the last day of exams were Friday, 12/16.  =
They
also would likely have better price options.  Faculty would have final
grades in by Friday, 12/16, so they would be less pressed (in the =
2003-2004
fall semester, final grades were due on 12/23) to get grades in.  The
committee strongly preferred having a few more vacation days before
Christmas Day.  The revised schedule would also allow for a slightly =
longer
Christmas break.  It would save money by not having the dorms and =
cafeteria
open for so long at the beginning of the semester.

=20

The only change to the Spring 2006 semester involved Martin Luther King, =
Jr.
day.  The committee has already voted to recommend having that day be =
the
Community Service Day (details in the previous committee minutes). =20

=20

So to summarize:          August

T 16     New Faculty User Interface training a.m. and =
Advising/Registration
p.m.; Fall Senate p.m.

W 17   New Faculty/Staff Orientation (this could also be held on T 16
concurrent with the Senate meeting)

                                    W 17   Community Day p.m.

                                    Th 18   Faculty Development Day =
(could
also be W17 if orientation moved to T 16) a.m.

                                    Th 18   School, Department, and =
Faculty
meetings p.m.

                                    F   19   Refresher Faculty
Advising/Registration p.m. with TGIF afterwards

                                    M  22  International and new =
students
arrive

                                    T   23   Transfer students arrive,
advising, registration

                                    T   23   New student advising and
registration

                                    W 24   Classes begin, mandatory =
first
day attendance

                                    December

                                    W  7    Last day of class

                                    Th 8, F 9 Exams
