Here are some examples.. this RTF program has been test run on a English Window 2000 system (with a Chinese software NJStar, and <id keyboard>) and it worked fine. But when it was run on Chinese Window XP, it flashed through very fast without pauses.

     800 <ms% 1000>/;

As for the keyboard device ID, I used <id “&#37749;&#30436;"> for my last experiment in Taiwan(sentence-matching) and it worked fine with Chinese Window 2000. 

Please let me know if you have any idea. In the meantime, I will try if I can find out the device ID, or the numerical IDs for the keys on a Chinese keyboard.

Thanks!
