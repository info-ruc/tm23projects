Hi folks,

I'm trying to put together a slightly unusual item file, and was 
wondering whether anyone has done something similar in the past.

I have a set of graphics, called icon1, icon2, ... icon20. Each time the 
script is called, I would like to randomly set each of counter1 through 
counter12 to an integer between 1 and 20, with each counter taking a 
different value. Then, as the item file is run, I would like to be able 
to display, for example, icon<value of counter2>.

In effect, I would like to assign random numbers to each counter with 
some constraints, and then use each as a pointer to a graphic.

Is there any way of doing this with DMDX? My inclination at the moment 
is that there is not, but I would appreciate any advice or confirmation 
of this!

Thanks,
Stuart.
