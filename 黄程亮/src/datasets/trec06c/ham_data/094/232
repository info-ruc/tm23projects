SDO Weekly Report for June 25, 2004

The Project continues to have trouble pushing its GSFC procurements
through the system.  Although it was reported at MSR that the RFI for
the star trackers had been released, this report was premature.  This
RFI has still not been released.  The Project had been planning to use
the Code 500 Procurement Office for the four Attitude Control System
(ACS) component procurements, but it is not clear now whether adequate
personnel will be available to support this.

An SDO Project Calendar will be available on the SDO MIS web site early
next week.  The Calendar will provide information on the regular Project
technical and programmatic meetings, on the Instrument and subsystem CDR
peer reviews commencing in the fall.  Donyea Burroughs
(Donyea.J.Burroughs.1--AT--gsfc.nasa.gov), our administrative assistant, will
maintain the calendar.

The Weekly systems team meeting addressed a draft list of major areas
that need to be completed by and addressed at the Subsystem CDR
presentations, both in order to reduce development risk and also to
demonstrate that the subsystems and the project are at a level of design
and implementation maturity adequate to warrant moving ahead into the
flight phase of the project . The systems team has taken an initial
first cut at this list all subsystems are performing a self assessment
within their teams and their functional organizations on what items need
to be added to demonstrate sufficient maturity to move on to flight
article manufacturing.

The ground system continued to test and verify the TSI Front End
Processor at the GSFC test facility. The FEP did have to go back to the
vendor last week for a Viterbi decoder problem but was re-received and
testing has continued this week. The IN-SNEC FEP, the second type unit,
is due for delivery in approximately two weeks. Also, the DDS group has
ordered the remaining hardware to complete the fully functional DDS
prototype system. Additionally, the GSM and Ground System Test Manager
have entered into discussions with Dryden as to the capabilities of the
NASA U2/ER2 aircraft and it's ability to support antenna verification.
Finally, work on documents, databases, and system design continues.

With the Phase A/B extension thru July, SDO, Lockheed Martin Solar
Astrophysics Laboratory (LMSAL), and Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory (SAO) continue working to complete the Phase C/D/E
contractual effort. The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) design and
development progress continues with a baseline telescope assembly mount
design, which will be forwarded to the Project for initial review, a
draft mirror coating spec, and an RFP for the structural model telescope
tube and flange pull test. Two lifetest filterwheels were received and
the assembly of the prototype shutters has been started. The SAO and
LMSAL thermal teams met and refined the models to support a power
reduction effort and a July thermal peer review.

The Helioseismic Magnetic Imager (HMI) team held a successful Critical
Design Review for the Michelson Interferometers this week. GSFC
participated in the Michelson CDR and no significant issues were
identified in the review. The HMI ICD was baselined on June 21. HMI
visited their structure subcontractor this week for a design status, and
to conduct a working session covering design issues. HMI is currently
conducting a trade study on DC/DC converters to evaluate impacts of
switching converter manufacturers. The DC/DC converters are on the
Common Buy list with SDO, and the HMI trade study is in response SDO
re-evaluating their suppliers.

At GSFC, the 2 mB SRAM proto-part were assembled on EUV Variability
Experiment (EVE) Subsystem Data Node (SDN) Breadboard this week; the SDN
team found a problem with the board and troubleshooting continues.
Northrup Grumman is bringing on additional staff to overcome schedule
delays in the development of C&DH Breadboards. Evaluation of the C&DH
Single Board Computer (SBC) and High Gain Assembly Subsystem (HGA)S
Gimbal Actuator proposals are on-going. RFI responses were received for
the Ka-Band Solid State Power Amplifier (SSPA).
