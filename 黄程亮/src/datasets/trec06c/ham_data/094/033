Hi folks,

This is really a question for Jonathan. I remember reading back in 
August (message id 935652) that you were considering adding support for 
input devices with axis information, so that the coordinates of a mouse 
/ eye-tracker etc could be stored when a response is made. I'm now 
designing an experiment where, ideally, participants will indicate the 
location of a visual stimulus by pressing in the appropriate area of a 
touch-sensitive monitor.

Is DMDX likely to have support for this scenario within, say, the next 
six months please? I'm already quite familiar with DMDX, having used it 
for the past four years, so I would ideally run this next experiment 
with it too. I also trust its timing accuracy more than many of the 
commercial applications that are available.

I also see that you were encouraging input as to functions that people 
might find useful for analogue input devices. Whilst these comments are 
a little late, in the _ideal_ situation I could somehow define a 
"response correct" area of the screen, so that correct and incorrect 
responses could be treated differently. However I'm aware that this 
could be quite tricky to implement, so I'm really only mentioning it for 
the record.

Thanks as ever for all your work on DMDX,
Stuart.
