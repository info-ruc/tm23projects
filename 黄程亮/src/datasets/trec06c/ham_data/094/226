Hi folks,

Back in January of last year Rua Haszard Morris sent a message to the
list reporting a blank screen between successively-displayed bitmaps and
digital video. I notice that similar issues have been discussed
subsequently, and appreciate that video and still images are drawn
rather differently by DMDX's display routines.

However, has anyone found a reliable way to display video after bitmaps
without the screen clearing between the two, please? It may be that this
isn't possible due to the way that the video is displayed. As an
example, with a delay parameter set to zero, the following simple script:

1 <bmp> "image1";
2 ! <dv> "video.avi";
3 ! <bmp> "image2";

... still gives rise to a noticeable flicker between each item, even
with an uncompressed avi, which is undesirable in many experimental
situations.

For example, I want participants to respond to bitmap displays, after 
which one of two videos play, depending on their response. The bitmap is 
identical to the first frame in both videos, so giving the impression of 
a continuous video, pausing in places, but which evolves with 
participants' responses. Rua advises me that he ended up using PsyScript 
in order to put together a similar experiment, and whilst this doesn't 
apparently give the same flicker, I trust DMDX, and would prefer to use 
it if at all possible. Does anyone have any relevant advice regarding 
this issue, please?

Thanks!
Stuart.
