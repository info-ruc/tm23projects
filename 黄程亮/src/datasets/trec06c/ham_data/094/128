   My initial guess is no.  You can chain one item file to another for that 
kind of effect but you'd need macro definitions or something that persisted 
across item files and DMDX goes to quite some length to remove effects 
across items.    It's certainly possible that a persistent macros flag 
could get created, but then you'd have to enter the name and there's no way 
within DMDX I can think of that would allow gathered data to get displayed 
later.  If you had a very limited range of unique names and could get the 
subject to choose amongst them it's eminently possible as you could decide 
which item file to chain but that's not what you're after.  Best solution 
is to write a batch file that first runs DMDX with a <ztr> item file (start 
-wait DMDX.exe -run itemfile.rtf) that lets them type their name in and 
exits DMDX.  Then with some automated scripting thing search the .zil 
output for the name and do a search and replace in another item file then 
run that in DMDX.  No problem if you're a scriptfu kind of guy but 
otherwise pretty big mojo.
