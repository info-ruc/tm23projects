I am moving a Keithley KPCI-PIO24 card from a Win '98 machine to a Win XP
Pro (sic) machine. I've installed the updated Keithley drivers (specific to XP)
and
have configured and tested the board through the Keithley utilities. I
installed the latest versions of DMDX and TimeDX, and am getting the
following error from the PIO test in TimeDX:
> 
>     Error 16424 using DriverLINX device
>     Invalid operation requested
> 
The error message then instructs me to manually configure the board so that
Channels 0 and 1 are input, and channel 2 is output. I've done this, and
TimeDX still gives me an error.

Has anyone run into this problem? Jonathan, any suggestions?
 
Thanks, -Michael
