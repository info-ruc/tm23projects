Dear all

I am running a target-rating type task and would like each participant to
be able to input a unique target name that will then be used in some but
not all items following. E.g., I'd like to have three different types of
item, two of which ask about predefined targets, but one of which asks
about a participant-entered target:

+2027<ms% 3000> <ln -1>"Describes you?"/! * <ms% 2000><ln 1>"critical";
+3003<ms% 3000> <ln -1>"Describes mother?"/! * <ms% 2000><ln 1>"angry";
+1026<ms% 3000> <ln -1>"Describes [unique name]?"/! * <ms% 2000><ln
1>"honest";

Is this currently possible, or would I just need to do a find-and-replace
on the script myself before starting my participant off?

Thanks,

Nicholas Gibson
