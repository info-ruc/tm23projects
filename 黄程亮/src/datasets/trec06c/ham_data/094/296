Attn Sir/Madam,

            PROPOSAL HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
        ==================================

My name is Mr. Ray Chinawah,I am the operational
manager in account management section incharge of
credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks
here in South Africa. I am writing in respect of a
foreign customer of my bank who perished on EGYPTIAN
Boeing 737 PLANE CRASH into the red sea with the whole
passengers aboard. 

There is an account opened in this bank by this great
late diamond and oil magnet who died without a written
or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since his death
, I personally has watched with keen interest to see
the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one
has come to claim his funds and no other person knows
about this account or anything concerning it,the
account has no other beneficiary and until his death
he was the manager of his company.

The total amount involved is 48,223,000.00 USD.[ Forty
eight million two hundred and twenty three thousand
United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first
transfer with $8,000,000.00[Eight million] and upon
successful transaction without any disappointment from
your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the
remaining balance to your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with the 
manager of the bank who I must involve in order to
have a smooth and a successful transfer of the fund to
any foreign bank account which you are going to
nominate. On this note, I want you to act as the
foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by
providing your bank account where the fund will be
transferred for immediate investment on any viable
project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to
stay more than 2 years without claim hence the money
will be recalled to the government treasury as
unclaimed after this long period of domancy. 

In view of this I got your contact through my personal
search to see if you can assist by providing your safe
bank account for the transfer or find a reliable
person who will be capable of receiving such amount in
his or her personal account.At the conclussion of the
transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give
you 20% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity
both in Africa and in your country while the remaining
5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties
might incure during the transfer process.

Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a
detailed information about the transaction.I will not
fail to bring to your notice that this business is
100% risk and trouble free and that you should not
entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you
apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from
the deceased. 

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail
or you can call me or fax me. You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe
communication. 

Respectfully yours,
Mr. Ray Chinawah.
