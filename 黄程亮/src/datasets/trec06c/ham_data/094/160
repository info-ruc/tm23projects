   Hey, all's well that ends.

   Yeah, no one including me has.  That's why it's a user tweakable 
parameter.  I get the code to work on my two machines and then it fails on 
a third.  But when I don't have access to those machines it's really hard 
to debug it and at this stage of the game I doubt that it would solve 
anything as the next machine is like as not going to fail a different 
way.  Francois' parameters are pretty similar to what I use to test the 
stuff so the fact that it works now is reassuring.

   It records for approximately the length of the timeout, it sounds like 
it's just not doing it correctly.

   It sounds like the machine's drivers or hardware is actually switching 
signal sources spuriously.  Like I say, it's almost impossible to write 
code to deal with the extraordinary variety of ways that sound card drivers 
fail.

   It's not worth in my experience, every machine or machine type or sound 
card or version of sound card driver appears to malfunction in a different 
way, yours being the most interesting to date.
