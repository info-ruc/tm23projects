   Well, beyond using an interface card that is sane you'll have to spend 
some quality time with the Keithley folks.  You'll have to get them to 
download DMDX and provide them with your script so they can see that the 
software works on the desktop machines.  Then they can either fix their 
driver software so the laptop hardware works like the desktop stuff or they 
can tell me what it is that I should change.  But the whole Keithley 
premise as far as I can tell is that it's fine to be tossing user level 
dialogs up to deal with what should be driver level configuration 
issues.  Stupid Keithley design equals busted DMDX behavior, sorry.  It's 
that or send me one of the cards so I can install it in a laptop here and 
see for my self what needs fudging.

   Stability itself is nothing else than a more sluggish motion.
