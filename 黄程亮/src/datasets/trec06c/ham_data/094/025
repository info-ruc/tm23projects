Hi.

I’ve made an input device that I can attach footpedals etc to.  I took
to pieces a USB mouse and just soldered on two sockets, so that other
switches can be attached to it (device works very nicely).  Can anyone
see any reason why this is a bad idea? I’m worried about using this DIY
approach in reaction time studies- would the 3 metres of wire attaching
the footpedal to my mouse circuit board make RT’s unreliable? Would
appreciate peoples thoughts on the matter.  Thanks, Andy.
