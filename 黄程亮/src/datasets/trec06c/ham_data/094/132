   DMDX 3.0.4.0 introduces two new features, a command line parameter -ez 
(that is also available from "Start / Programs / DMDX / DMDX EZ mode") and 
a video mode option "desktop":

-ez
DMDX runs in EZ (or easy) mode with this option. Use of TimeDX to time 
displays is not required however displays are no longer synchronized with 
the raster. Facilitates demonstrations of DMDX with minimal setup 
(especially when used with <vm desktop>) and should not be used to gather 
time sensitive data.  Because the duration of a frame is no longer accurate 
use of the frame option % or <%> is inadvisable and instead <%ms> should be 
used.  When an unknown display refresh rate is requested as always happens 
under 98/ME or when something like <vm 1024,768,16,0> is used then a 60Hz 
rate is assumed (even if the actual display rate is completely different).

<vm desktop> The desktop usage detects the current desktop settings and 
uses them, the video mode however still has to have been timed with TimeDX 
unless EZ mode is being used.

In the beginning was the word.
But by the time the second word was added to it,
there was trouble.
For with it came syntax ...
