Dear All,
  We are trying to get a simple experiment running where we present a 
number for 500 msecs (37 ticks), and then following subjects response, have 
a delay of 100 msecs (8 ticks) before the next stimulus occurs. We 
accomplished this specifying the fd for each stimulus on each line, and 
putting a <d 8> parameter in the header with a <t 1500>. However, as we are 
doing this with fMRI we wanted the zil output so we could also get a 
measure of when the scans were being acquired.
  The correct timing for the experiment would only work if the output was 
azk, but not zil. Any thoughts/suggestions?

Thank you for your help in advance.

Best,
  Gregg
