This is rather cunning Andy -- thanks for that suggestion. After a 
little bit of playing around, I think this is going to be the way to go. 
Problem solved!

Thanks also to Jonathan for the update -- it's good to have the option 
to display digital video, and in the meantime this is a good work-round 
for experiments like the one I'm designing.

Stuart.
