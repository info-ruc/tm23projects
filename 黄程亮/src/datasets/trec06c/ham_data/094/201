SDO Weekly Report for June 18, 2004

SDO Project Management’s focus is on making sure that the critical
activities that need to be accomplished during this phase leading up to
CDR are understood, that adequate resources are available, and that the
management processes are in place to support these activities
efficiently.  Schedule tracking, earned value metrics, monthly
reporting, configuration management, risk management, and identification
of critical subsystem and element CDR milestones have all been topics of
discussion, and efforts are underway to further define these areas and
improve the supporting processes.

The SDO Weekly Systems meeting was devoted to a presentation covering an
overview of the SDO project Configuration Management (CM) and Work Order
Authorization (WOA) approach and process. This overview covered all
aspects of the CM process and was intended to provide guidance, and
solicit comments to improve the process, as we move into detailed design
and test activities.  The Monthly Systems Engineering Risk validation
Board Meeting was held, and the agenda was limited to only new risks and
green risks.  This allowed time for the review of all green risks.

SDO’s MIS personnel have begun discussing system requirements with Indus
personnel.  SDO has tasked Indus, through the Code 296 BASE Contract, to
take over responsibility for the MIS system and the enhancements
required to implement the Work Order and Problem Reporting functions.

SDN Breadboards for Flight Software and ACE have been completed with
512kB SRAM. Two 2 mB SRAM proto-parts were received from 3DPLUS this
week. These parts will be put on the GCE 1 and EVE SDN Breadboards,
which have been fully assembled and were awaiting this part. Evaluation
of the SBC proposals is on-going. Proposal evaluation for the HGAS
Gimbal Actuator will start next week. RFIs were released for the Ka Band
SSPA and the ACS IRU. SDO Project personnel visited ConTech and
Hypertronics to discuss qualification and delivery cPCI connectors for
SDO. The meeting was very productive.

The Materials Assurance Engineer (MAE) met with the Ka-Band transmitter
development team. To better measure heat generated by the power
amplifier chip he will be providing IR Thermography support to
characterize the thermal profile of this critical chip in the electronic
box. The MAE is also assisting Ka-Band development personnel in the
preparation and submittal of several adhesives for outgassing testing.

MIT Lincoln Labs delivered and tested an alternative device (also known
as electrical test unit) CCD to EVE at LASP on Monday. Testing went very
well and demonstrated very low noise characteristics of the CCD and
set-up. In July, MIT LL will deliver a test CCD that uses the candidate
Lessor process treatment. A molecular transport model for EVE is nearing
completion. The model will further define contamination requirements for
EVE. The Spacecraft Simulator hardware will ship this week  to EVE.  The
hardware was due to ship last week, but a last minute problem delayed
the shipment (this was incorrectly reported as accomplished last week).
The SSIM support team will visit EVE next week for installation and
check-out of the simulator. The SDO/EVE ICD revision 6 is under short
review for baselining in a CCB on Monday.

The HMI team is preparing for the Michelson Interferometer CDR to be
held on June 22. On Wednesday, June 23, HMI will have their Monthly
Status Review with the project via telecon. HMI has requested to raise
the radiators to increase focal length and is working with SDO thermal,
mechanical, and ACS groups to accommodate the increase in height. HMI
has started running the SUROM on the processor board. Four flight
batches of CCDs are now in process at e2v.

LMSAL and SDO have extended the AIA Phase A/B contract until July 31;
effort continues to get the C/D/E contract in place. SAO has completed
their ball joint testing and is evaluating the effects on the leg
designs; a LMSAL review is scheduled for next week. AIA continues to
review their power estimates and expect to report the results in about
one week's time and hold a thermal peer review in July. Internal reviews
of the ISS limb tracker board and the SUROM code and requirements
documents were completed; software peer reviews will continue until
acceptance testing in July. The EDU RAD6000 processor board is nearly
complete; the test fixture has been sent to BAE and testing is expected
to start next week.

The ground system received the results of the April 21-22 Ground System
PDR from Code 300 this week. In summary, the ground system was given an
"excellent" rating by the Chair of the Code 300 Review Panel with a
total of only 23 RFAs being accepted. The MOMS contract was successfully
modified this week and a draft NENS contract modification, also with
HTSI, was also completed. Testing continues on the first of two Data
Distribution System (DDS) Front End Processors  (FEPs).  Substantial
progress continues on all document and CCB activity.
