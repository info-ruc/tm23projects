FROM THE DESK OF LEO ECHENDU.

ACCOUNTS & AUDIT DEPARTMENT,

HALLMARK BANK LTD,

LAGOS,NIGERIA.

E-MAIL:chenduleo@zonai.com



Dear Sir



I do recognize the surprise this urgent but confidential letter brings to you, especially as it came from a stranger.



I am Mr. Leo Echendu, the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Hallmark Bank,Lagos Nigeria In my department, we discovered an abandoned sum of US$10.150m (Ten million, one hundred and fifty thousand United States Dollars only) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers Mr. Sheu Yuan Dong, who died along side his wife on the 16th Fabruary 1998 in a Chinese plane crash.



Since we got the information of his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guide.



Since then I have made several enquiries to his embassy to locate any of his extended relatives. But this has also proved unsuccessful.I have contacted you to assist in securing this money before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by my bank. 

It's therefore, upon discovery that I decided to make business with you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to the deceased for safe keeping and subsequent disbursement, since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to go back into Federal Government's account as unclaimed bill.



Note that,it does not necessarily matter,whether you are biologically related to the deceased or not. As you may bear with me, a next of kin could be blood relation,business associate, friend or even a well wisher. So,whether you are related to him or not is never a barrier to realizing this transaction.



The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such an account remains dormant or non-operational after a period of five (5) years, the money will be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed fund.



However, attempts has been made twice by the Government Agency concerned to confiscate this account since the expiration of the five years if not for my intervention as the head account and audit dept.as I have always told them that the next of kin has been in touch with us.



The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner.



Please be honest to me. Therefore, to enable the immediate transfer of the fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as the next of kin to the diseased. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you the text of application which you will fax to my bank.



Note that this transaction requires utmost confidentiality. And I am assuring you that it is 100% risk free. 



So you need not be afraid.



I expect a positive response from you soonest.



Best regards,



Mr. Leo Echendu.
