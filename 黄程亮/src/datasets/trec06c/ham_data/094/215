   You can use the indexed branching to do what you need.  If you want to 
combine the graphic with others but don't want to duplicate the items you 
can use the indexed branch to set a macro to the graphic name you want in a 
set of indexed branch destinations and then use macro in one item 
later.  If item numbers 1..20 are too limited for item numbers in an 
indexed branch set another counter to some base item number and add you 
index to it before branching on the sum.
