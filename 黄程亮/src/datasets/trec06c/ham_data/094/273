   The only way I can think of to have this happen (beyond modifying DMDX) 
would require a constant delay between the threshold and the PIO 
signal.  The items would have to use continuous running with a fixed delay 
between items and the item afterward would have to send the PIO 
signal.  But even then it wouldn't surprise me to have some inconsistency 
crop up, at the very least it's going to be the duration of the buffer used 
to sample the voice data.
