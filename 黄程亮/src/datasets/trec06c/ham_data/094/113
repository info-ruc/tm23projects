REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

ATT: DIRECTOR/C.E.O.

Greetings,

My name is Mrs. Janet. m. Garba, the wife of Mr. Mukadi Garba, the former 
minister of agriculture in Zimbabwe located in the Southern Africa. I got 
your contacts while searching for reputable and actively involved companies 
in your country. Currently, I am in South Africa now as United Nations (UN) 
refugee, because of my husband’s predicament back home. Perhaps, if you are 
conversant with world news you can understand better.

I called your embassy, which described your country as being economically 
conducive for investment and people as transparent and trustworthy to engage 
in business on which premise me to write you. Though I did not describe the 
reason for my enquiries to the embassy. My husband was recently fired from 
office by a backed uprising of mass demonstrators and the senate. My husband 
is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption, embezzlement 
and the most serious charge of plunder which might lead to death sentence. 
The present government is forcing my husband out of Zimbabwe to avoid 
demonstration by his supporters.

During my husband regime as a minister I realised some reasonable amount of 
money from various deals that he successfully executed. I have plans to 
invest this money for my children future on real estate and industrial 
production. My husband is not aware of this, because I wish to do it 
secretly for now. Before my husband was impeached,
I secretly siphoned the sum of  US$16.5m (Sixteen million five hundred 
thousand united states dollars) out of Zimbabwe and deposited the money with 
a security firm that transports valuable goods and consignment through 
diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold and my 
foreign business owned it. I am contacting you because I want to You to 
present yourself as my foreign business partner to the security company and 
claim the money on my behalf since I have declared that the consignment 
belong to my foreign business partner. I shall also require you to assist me 
in investment guidelines in your country.

I trust you as a God fearing person who will not seat on this money when you 
claim it, rather assist me properly I expect you to declare what percentage 
of the total money you will demand for your assistance. When I receive your 
positive response, I shall refer you to my attorney who is presently with 
all the depositing documents and he shall send them to you to enable you 
proceed to the security company and claim the money. I shall also let you 
know where the security company is and the payment pin code to claim the 
money, which is very important. If you wish to help us you can contact us on 
the above contact address I will give more details when I receive your 
reply.

Thank you and God bless.

Yours Sincerely,

Mrs. Janet.m. Garba.
(On behalf of the family)
