Hi, I wonder if anyone had ever encountered below problem when running DmDX program on a Chinese Window XP system. (I am going to run an Self-paced Reading experiment in Taiwan.)

DmDX version: 3.0.3.1
system: Chinese Window XP Professional edition
Experiment: Self-Paced Reading 
The control line:
<n 64> <azk> <fd 30> <wfbo><t 90000> <d 0> <id  “&#37749;&#30436;"> <vm 640 480 480 8 0>

Problem: 

At first, there was an error "Could not find register key <software\IMEDX\3\1\0\...\600x480(480)_8bpp_0Hz>"

I timed 600x480 first and then 1024x768 in TimeDX and saved both values. Then the above error disappeared.
 
However, when I did run the program,it flashed through very fast without pause for response. 


I would really appreciate any help to solve this problem. Thanks!

Shu-ju Chi
