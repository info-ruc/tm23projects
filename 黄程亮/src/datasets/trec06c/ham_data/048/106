 I have released DMDX 1.1.09 which includes the new RawJoystick input
device that performs similarily to a PIO12 making it the accurate input
device of choice as wiring switches up for it is easier than a PIO12 (no
resistors), TimeDX 1.03's PIO Test has been expanded to switch between the
PIO12 and the RawJoystick.  The DMDX VOX calibration dialog now deals with
DirectSoundCapture create failure (basically the sound card doesn't have
what it takes), before the dialog could get lost behind other windows.
