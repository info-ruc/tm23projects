Glad you brought that up. I would, of course, take code for the
miniboard, fingerboard, etc. I use the F1 board myself. There are enough
people out there who like to port things, anyway.

I'll start working on it, but it'll take some time. I've got two other
programming jobs going on now.

Anybody willing to comb book sites and things to build up the database?

Jonathan... Hmmm, I saw a nice script I could use in that O'Reilly
