Summary
=======

1. Committee Reports

   Financial, Academic and Research Committee
   ==========================================

   Ann Walker <annw@bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   - They have finished writing a policy statement for "Advising" and
     other aspects of the graduate student process.  Again, this is a
     document that states what they think the responsibilities of
     students, faculty, depts and the univ should be in the advisor/
     advisee relationship and degree process.

     It is now ready for members of other committees to review.
     Other interested students may also learn more about it by
     contacting Ann.

   ----

   One attendee communicated a suggestion for how to get the "Advising"
   document recognized once it has been reviewed, i.e., by taking a
   step-by-step approach: having the GSO/grad students "sign on" to the
   policies in the document, then faculty/depts and finally the GRS
   administration.

   Another suggested that when it is ready for the administration, it
   should be presented via the Liaison Committee.

   Healthcare Committee
   ====================

   Rob Pitts <rip@cs.bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   They have:

   - Listed a portion of Massachusetts' minimum coverage requirements
     for Qualifying Student Health Insurance Plans in the "Legislation/Laws"
     section of the Healthcare Pages (http://gso.bu.edu/healthcare).  This
     portion of the regulations mainly describes what maximums/deductibles/
     copayments student insurance programs can have.

     - Although the NAGPS-endorsed health insurance plan is supposed
       to reflect those state regulations, the plan is still in the
       process of getting their Claims Dept up to speed on that.  So we
       will defer making those updates on our web site until then.  I.e.,
       the NAGPS health plan write-up on the Healthcare Pages currently
       reflects the coverage for the plan nationally for 99/00, but does
       not list the better coverage they are supposed to provide in Mass.

   - Updated the Association Dental Plan for 99/00 on the Healthcare Pages.
     This is the NAGPS-endorsed dental discount plan, which apparently will
     no longer be endorsed this fall.

   - Added an additional dental discount plan to the Healthcare Pages, the
     CAREINGTON Dental Plan, which is offered through the Education Finance
     Group (the company that offers the NAGPS-endorsed health plan).

   Housing Committee
   =================

   This committee is out of town for the summer.

   Liaison Committee
   =================

   Rob Pitts <rip@cs.bu.edu>, acting liaison for the summer, reported
   for this committee.

   Some of the following information comes from meetings with Andrea
   White (assistant to Assoc. Dean Whitaker).

   International TF Orientation
   ----------------------------

   Mike Elioff <elioff@chem.bu.edu> volunteered to run a social event
   during this orientation.  The event will probably be the evening of
   Monday, August 23rd, 6pm in the GSU.  GRS will provide some food and
   Mike's band will play.  They would like to invite continuing students to
   come mingle with the new students, but this will be contingent on costs.

   Also, there are other events for new int'l TFs during this orientation,
   including a Red Sox game, trolley tour of Boston, movie, and various
   receptions.  In addition, they are giving these new students a free
   week's T pass (to use whenever they like).

   New Student Packets
   -------------------

   We've given an updated "GSO Sept. '99 Events" flyer to GRS to be
   included in the information packets that new students will receive
   when they arrive in the Fall.  It lists 4 events: the information
   fair for new students, a talk on "Intellectual Property", a social
   event, and our first GSO meeting of the semester.

   Library Privileges
   ------------------

   Aimee Trochio <atrochio@bu.edu>, a grad rep from English who is
   currently representing those students on this issue, met with Martha
   Wellman Kahn from GRS.  Ms. Kahn was not able to help on the issue,
   but suggested continuing to keep after Assoc. Dean Whitaker.  She
   did inform Aimee, however, that the library gets info about who are
   TFs from the main student information system rather than the Records
   Office.  Aimee and our liaison will try to meet with Whitaker after
   he returns from his vacation.

   Grad Student Fee
   ----------------

   Andrea White suggested that if we want to pursue instituting a student
   fee by which the GSO would be funded, we may be able to have GRS send
   an e-mail to GRS students, surveying them on that issue.

   GRS Funding for GSO
   -------------------

   As far as GRS funding different GSO events, Andrea White would just
   like to make sure that she gets notice of the money needed (e.g.,
   for social events, etc.) at least one week prior to the event.

   Social Committee
   ================

   This committee did not report.

   Steering Committee
   ==================

2. Fall Activities
