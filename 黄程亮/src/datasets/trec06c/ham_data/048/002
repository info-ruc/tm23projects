Jonathan:
As a relative newbie I'd be very interested in seeing a HandyBoard code
(IC and assembler) site.  Copying and then modifying other people's
code has been a great learning tool for me.  Copying one person's work
is plagiarism, copyying from several is research!

Maybe implemented as a HandyBoard general resource site ... both hard
and software ... some trouble shooting thrown in.  Simple ideas like
using servo tape on the bottom of the battery box holding a couple of
2x6 LEGO bricks ... a six dollar battery box on each 'bot ... things
like that.
