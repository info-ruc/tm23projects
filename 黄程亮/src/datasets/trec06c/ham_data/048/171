To add to Martin's question, how can you change the baud rate used by IC 
3.x?

It's easy enough to alter the speed of the UART by setting the BAUD register 
or POKEing the relevant location in the pcode interpreter.  Randy Sargent's 
code fragments can be extended in either direction 
(http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html).  If anyone wants, 
I can post my own version of this code - including set_baud() and other 
functions - to the new IC archive.  Moreover, changing the timing would 
presumably allow any baud rate on the PA7 serial line described in 
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu:80/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/serial.html, 
though I haven't tried it.

But changing the speed of the development environment itself is a different 
matter.  I need to slow things down because my RF serial link only handles 
up to 4800 baud, and I don't want to lose the 'I' part of IC.  Any help 
whatsoever would be welcome.  Ultimately, we may need Randy, Fred & Co. to 
release IC 3.3!

Peace,
George
