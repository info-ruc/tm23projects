I'm curious; what is the difference between the "buoyancy tank" and the
"resevoir"?  I'd think moving air from one tank to another won't 
actually
affect buoyancy.  Am I missing something?

That's interesting; but difficult, right?  Ensuring a watertight seal 
around
the piston even under various pressure differences is really hard.  Can 
you refer a specific piston system?

That's a good idea.
