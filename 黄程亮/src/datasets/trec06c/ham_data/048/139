I have several Diamond Stealth 3D 2000 cards that have the S3 Virge (86C325)
chip on them and have had no luck getting it running (past 640x480x1). I got
the virge.c driver with some boodle but no entry in the vgadb. I tried
putting it with the other Virge cards and hoped it was going to be
compatible. It wasn't. Any help would be appreciated.
