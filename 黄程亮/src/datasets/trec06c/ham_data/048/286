My hb was working fine, I took it on a trip in an antistatic bag. When I
took it out of the bag, the battery was completely drained. But as soon as
I started to charge it, one of the resistors burned up. So I tried
charging it via the interface board, which worked, but the batteries won't
hold their charge. When they do have some charge, all the red lights and
the green ON light all light up and it won't go into bootstrap mode. Does
anyone know what's wrong?
