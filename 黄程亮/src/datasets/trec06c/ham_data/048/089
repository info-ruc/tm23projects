I just assembled my handyboard, but i get some memory errors (almost
everywhere, but the addresses vary in some bytes)... i tested two
different RAM chips and i still get the errors. They're intermitent (i
get many ............'s then many errors, then a few ......'s again.

Are my RAM chips faulty, or is it the board? (i also tested two diff.
373's and 132's).

Thanks!
