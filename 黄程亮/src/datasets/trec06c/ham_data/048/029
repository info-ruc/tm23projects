  Hmm, that's odd.  Only thing I can think of is that the dialog is somehow
going behind the big blue window and therefore you can't see it, but I
don't see that behavior on my systems so I suspect it might be somehting
else.  What happens when you run TimeDX's Sound test and press the record
button?  Does the signal strength bar show any signal?  These are windows
95 or 98 boxes I take it, no NT stuff?  What version of DirectX has been
installed?
