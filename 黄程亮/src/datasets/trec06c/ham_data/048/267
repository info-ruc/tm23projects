Hi all,
	Seeing notes about the sub and all, I thought I shall share some
info. I know this list is purely for HB enthusiasts and forgive me if this
does not interest you. 

	The reason I got involved in HB was when I planned to use HB for a
Aerial robot competition that is held by Georgia tech.

	The object of the competition is to use an unmanned (no human
interaction ever) flying craft (heli, aircraft, balloon anything) that can
detect objects like coloured cans on the ground from air and pick them up
and drop them in a specially marked container. Of course it is more
complicated and as far as I know, nobody has won. It involves everything
from micro mouse theories to computer "vision". The rules are not that
simple, you can find them at
http://avdil.gtri.gatech.edu/AUVS/CurrentIARC/FutureEventInfo.html

	I was studying the HB so that I can use the HB to maintain the
autonomous "nervous" system for the craft like gyro, "aerial stability",
fuel monitoring, motor control  blah blah blah, while the ground based
computer makes "intelligent decisions" as to what to pick and where to go.
This relives the main computer in doing maintenance work.

	The idea to form a team to compete has been in my mind for some
time, but was never able to pursue it fully for the lack of time (I work
in Silicon Valley) and for the funds needed.

	If anybody is interested in forming a team or at at least discuss
the feasibility of using HB to do some of the stuff I mentioned, please
contact me separately outside the alias.

Thanks,
-Satish.
