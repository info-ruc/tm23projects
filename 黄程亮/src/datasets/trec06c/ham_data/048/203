I remember someone saying a few months ago that if you use a 12 V battery with the HB, then the HB's built-in charging circuit won't work properly, and that 12 V batteries can initially deliver up to about 14 V, which wouldn't be very kind to the electronics.

The simple (but possibly expensive) solution is to get a remote control car that's already been built and has its own battery, then add the HB to it.  The steering servo found in most RC cars can be controlled directly by the HB, and the electronic speed controller could probably be disconnected from the radio receiver and controlled in a similar way.  I bought an old, used RC-10 race car for use as a robot platform, and it's extremely rugged (aluminum chassis, adjustable shocks, differential, etc.)

Alternatively, you could use an external H-bridge circuit and separate battery to drive your motors.  This is the cheap, safe solution.  Good luck!
