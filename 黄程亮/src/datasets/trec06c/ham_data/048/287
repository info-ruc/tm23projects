Antistatic bags are conductive, right?  You might have shorted the power to
the ground via the bag itself, thereby killing your battery.  Once a NiCad
cell shorts, then it will can a large amount of current from a charger,
possibly killing off a resistor that is in series (is there one on the
Handyboard in series?).

I would expect that replacing the battery pack and the resistor may solve
the problem.
