Hi Guys,

The original statement is in "Report On Planet Three" or "Profiles of the
Future". It's definitely something he wrote as he refers to it many times
elsewhere. I think the original context was about starflight.

WHERE ARE THEY?

What follows is a commentary on several recent theories regarding life in
our galaxy and my ideas on the results of these theories when applied to the
Drake Equation in attempt to answer Fermi's Paradox.

Drake's Equation (see http://www.seti.org/drake-eq.html for an explanation)
has been a past topic of conversation here many times. I first came across
this equation many years ago and have been fascinated with it ever since.
For those of you not familiar with it, it basically an algebraic
representation of the probability for the existence of life, and in
particular, intelligent life in our galaxy. This was in response to Fermi's
famous query, "Where are they?", now called Fermi's Paradox.

I am always interested in any ideas or theories that would help to answer
Fermi's question and recently two new theories have been propounded that
bear directly upon the parameters for Drake's Equation. The equation itself
is fairly straight forward. Choosing values for each of the variables
however, is not so easy. Many of these variables must be no more than
educated guesses. Different values for some of the variables can produce
wildly different results, hence a better understanding of the conditions
which define those variables can make an enormous difference in the accuracy
of the equations solution.


GAMMA RAY BURSTS

The first new theory is from James Annis, an astrophysicist at Fermilab near
Chicago. He thinks cataclysmic gamma-ray bursts often sterilize galaxies,
wiping out life forms before they have evolved sufficiently to leave their
planet (Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, vol 52, p 19). GRBs
are thought to be the most powerful explosions in the Universe, releasing as
much energy as a supernova in seconds. Many scientists think the bursts
occur when the remnants of dead stars such as neutron stars or black holes
collide.

Annis points out that each GRB unleashes devastating amounts of radiation.
"If one went off in the Galactic center, we here two-thirds of the way out
on the Galactic disc would be exposed over a few seconds to a wave of
powerful gamma rays." He believes this would be lethal to life on land.

The rate of GRBs is about one burst per galaxy every few hundred million
years. But Annis says theories of GRBs suggest the rate was much higher in
the past, with galaxies suffering one strike every few million years -- far
shorter than any plausible time scale for the emergence of intelligent life
capable of space travel. That, says Annis, may be the answer to Fermi's
question. "They just haven't had enough time to get here yet," he says. "The
GRB model essentially resets the available time for the rise of intelligent
life to zero each time a burst occurs."

Paul Davies, a visiting physicist at Imperial College, London, says the
basic idea for resolving the paradox makes sense. "Any Galaxy-wide
sterilizing event would do," he says. However, he adds that GRBs may be too
brief: "If the drama is all over in seconds, you only zap half a planet. The
planet's mass shields the shadowed side." Annis counters that GRBs are
likely to have many indirect effects, such as wrecking ozone layers that
protect planets from deadly levels of ultraviolet radiation.

Annis also highlights an intriguing implication of the theory: the current
rate of GRBs allows intelligent life to evolve for a few hundred million
years before being zapped, possibly giving it enough time to reach the space
faring stage. "It may be that intelligent life has recently sprouted up at
many places in the Galaxy and that at least a few groups are busily engaged
in spreading."


LARGE MOONS

The second theory deals with a surprising connection between the conditions
required for a total eclipse and for the emergence of intelligent life.
Guillermo Gonzalez of the University of Washington in Seattle points out
that our distance from the Sun is a necessary condition for us to be here.
"If we were a little nearer or farther from the Sun, the Earth would be too
hot or too cold and so uninhabitable," says Gonzalez. At the same time our
existence depends on an unusually large moon since its pull stops the Earth
wobbling around too much on its axis and causing wild and catastrophic
swings in climate like those on Mars. Our Moon, which is unusually large
compared to those in almost all other planet-moon systems, probably formed
from molten material blasted from the Earth during the impact of a giant
body more than 4 billion years ago.

In the current issue of Astronomy & Geophysics (vol 40, p 3.18), Gonzalez
points out that the way the Moon formed means it started off very close to
the Earth and has taken several billion years to move far enough away until
it precisely covers the Sun during an eclipse. "The timescale is very
similar to that of the appearance of intelligent life," he says. "It is
therefore not such a big coincidence that we are around at the time when it
is possible to see total eclipses."

Because tidal effects cause the Moon to slowly recede from the Earth,
perfect eclipses have been visible only for about 150 million years and will
continue for only another 150 million years, about 5 per cent of the current
age of the Earth. Furthermore, Earth is the only planet in our Solar System
where a perfect eclipse is visible, although there are 64 other moons.

If Gonzalez is right, then all extraterrestrials, wherever they are, are
likely to live on planets like ours that experience total eclipses. But
since an unusually large Moon is rare, he says, this suggests that both ETs
and total eclipses are very rare indeed.


WHAT IT MEANS

Taken together, these two factors enormously reduce the values of at least
one and probably as many as three variables to practically zero offering at
least one possible answer to Fermi's query, there aren't any...

If you consider all of the factors you can write a simple relation, using
Drake's Equation, for estimating the probability. I use the word "estimate"
intentionally because our knowledge of most of the factors is so poor that
we are really only guessing.

Drake's Equation, involves 7 factors as follows:


|Number of    |   |Rate     |   |Fraction|   |Number  |   |Fraction|
|civilizations|   |of       |   |of stars|   |of      |   |of      |
|in our galaxy|   |star     |   |with    |   |planets |   |planets |
|capable of   | = |formation| X |planets | X |per star| X |on which|
|communication|   |(per     |                |with    |   |life    |
|now          |   |year)    |                |suitable|   |appears |
                                             |environ-|
                                             |ment    |

     |Fraction|   |Fraction |   |Longevity   |
     |of life |   |of       |   |of each     |
     |bearing |   |intelli- |   |technology  |
   x |planets | X |gent     | X |in          |
     |on which|   |societies|   |communi-    |
     |intelli-|   |which    |   |cative      |
     |gence   |   |develop  |   |mode (years)|
     |emerges |   |communi- |
                  |cation   |
                  |ability  |


Suppose you guessed that stars in our galaxy form at the rate of one per
year (probably not a bad estimate), that 1/5 of the stars have planets (no
one knows), that there are 0.0005859375 planets with stable environments
(length of time between GRBs divided by the age of our solar system times
the fraction of planets with suitable moons in our solar system ), that life
appears on each (fraction = 1), that intelligence emerges on each of these
(fraction= 1), that 1/10 of these develop communication capability and that
these remain in this state for 1000 years. Then, it works out that the
number is 0.01171875. In other words, in one hundred thousand years, only
one intelligent, communicative civilization would appear, far less than most
current speculations.

Note that other than the value for suitable life bearing planets, all of the
rest of the values were heavily in favor of intelligent life developing.
Reducing either of the next two factors to reasonable levels further reduces
the odds by several orders of magnitude.

If you accept these two theories (and remember, they are just theories),
then in all likelihood Earth is the only planet in the galaxy that currently
harbors intelligent life.

The Next Thirty Years: A Business Vision
by Joe Schembrie
AstroTug Corporation

Seattle - July 19, 1999 - Thirty years ago, when the Apollo astronauts
became the first humans to voyage to the Moon, they surveyed the lunar
landscape and spoke of 'magnificent desolation.' Thirty years later, the
Moon is still as desolate as they left it. Will it be that way thirty years
from now?

Back in the 1960s, we had so many heady dreams that never came to pass. We
thought that the Apollo missions would be followed up by regular flights to
the Moon. There would soon be a refueling base, and then even colonies. Next
stop: Mars.

Why not? The government was spending 5.7 % of the federal budget on the
space program. Massive government spending would buy the rockets, the
stations, the moon bases. The best and brightest, attracted to government
service through selfless dedication, would plan every step. Enduring
motivation would be provided through government-mandated goals of national
prestige, defense, and science.

Then the taxpayers grumbled, and the ordering of governmental priorities was
altered. Thirty years of space-advocate cheerleading for public funding has
coincided with a seven-fold decline in NASA's budget and the indefinite
postponement of trips beyond Earth orbit. The bad news is, today we're in
competition before Congress with a million other bright ideas on how to
spend other people's tax money -- and all of them are 'for the children.'

The good news is, today we no longer have to rely solely on government to
advance the cause of human space exploration. The computer and
communications revolutions are creating an ever-increasing demand for
commercial satellites. A hundred-billion-dollar launch services market cries
out for cheap access to space. And what a market that big wants, it usually
gets.

Following is a brief scenario of how private enterprise might advance the
human space endeavor. It's not a call for a government industrial planning
agency. It's not a call for special subsidies. It's not the business plan of
any one company. It's simply some speculations on how that much-maligned
motivator known as 'short-term profit-seeking' may well lure us back to the
Moon -- this time not just to plant footprints, but to establish cities.

The Personal Space Initiative begins with cheap access to space. Reusable
Launch Vehicles are already being built which will replace the far more
expensive throwaway vehicles presently used to launch satellites. Within the
next four years, by 2004, surely one such vehicle will be orbiting payloads
for less than $1000/pound.

First-generation RLVs will be too small to place large payloads directly
into high orbit. Instead, they will launch satellite and orbital transfer
fuel on separate flights into Low Earth Orbit. A teleoperated space tug,
guided by humans and computers on the ground, will shepherd the satellite
and fuel together and push them toward Geosynchronous Earth Orbit -- and
beyond.

For such LEO-to-GEO transfers, ion propulsion in place of chemical-fuel
propulsion will save thousands of pounds of fuel per space tug mission. With
fuel transported from Earth into low orbit costing $1000/pound, millions of
dollars will be saved per mission. NASA's Deep Space One probe has already
proven that ion propulsion is feasible for inner solar system space flight.
A reusable ion space tug can be built now and be ready for transorbital
missions when RLVs need them, around 2005.

Yet ion propulsion is slow to accelerate, and can take a month or more
pushing a satellite from LEO to GEO -- and time is a very critical cost
issue when satellite depreciation and interest charges run to millions of
dollars per month. An alternative, preferable source of high-thrust chemical
fuel for orbital transfer missions can be found on the Moon, where lunar ice
can be mined and converted into hydrogen-oxygen fuel by teleoperated
equipment, and then transported by teleoperated vehicles down to LEO for
only a few dollars per pound. 'Lunar Express' can be in service by 2007.

The satellite orbital transfer business will annually require hundreds of
thousands of pounds of lunar ice/fuel to be shipped from Luna to LEO. Why
couldn't humans ride to the Moon on the return trips? Perhaps by 2009, a
human will revisit the Moon aboard a teleoperated moon shuttle.

Humans on the Moon will prospect for rare metals. For an overall transport
cost which is a tiny fraction of their market value, gold, platinum,
palladium, and even silver mined on the Moon can be lifted into lunar orbit
with chemical rockets whose hydrogen-oxygen fuel is derived from lunar ice,
and then towed down to LEO with ion space tugs, and then dropped from LEO to
Earth's surface inside disposable atmospheric entry shells. Lunar rare
metals -- a potential twenty billion dollar a year industry -- should be
discovered by 2011.

In just four years, the California Gold Rush drew two hundred thousand
people across a continental divide as formidable in the nineteenth century
as the distance between Earth and Moon will be in the twenty-first. A
multi-billion dollar lunar mining industry could afford and rapidly attract
thousands of miners as soon as a major strike occurs. And with that
$1000/pound shipping charge from Earth, there will be a powerful incentive
to grow food, manufacture clothing, and construct habitats from local
materials. Accomplishing those tasks of lunar self-sufficiency will be
thousands of additional workers -- and entrepreneurs.

Lunar mining company executives will want to retain people rather than ship
them up from Earth in rapid rotation, and that means making the lunar
environment as hospitable as possible. Perhaps cities will resemble
something along the lines of multiple stadium-like enclosures, with a
transparent dome over a central parkland, ringed by condominiums and shops.
The first such lunar atrium, housing as many as a thousand humans, could be
erected by 2015.

As life on the Moon proceeds from magnificent desolation to comfortable
self-sufficiency, and second-generation RLVs bring the cost of space access
down to $100/pound or less, other reasons for lunar colonization open up.
There's space tourism. There's old folks retirement (for those in their late
seventies and older, low gravity can make the difference between an active
and sedentary lifestyle). And the environmental laws will be looser and the
taxes lower (we hope).

By 2030, the Moon could be speckled with numerous large domed ecospheres,
filled with trees and lakes gleaming beneath the earthlight, populated by
creative and industrious pioneers who consider themselves not so much the
offspring of earthly states as the founding citizens of an interplanetary
civilization.

The Apollo astronauts saw a barren, airless, lifeless world that made them
glad to come home. The Moon has remained in that pristine but slaglike state
for thirty years. But thirty years from now, there will be enterprises and
cities, gardens and even young forests on the Moon.

How soon can this vision be realized? Ion tugs could be ready when RLVs are,
and once teleoperated vehicles are in routine service to the Moon, it will
be difficult to restrain humans from hitching rides. Creative individual
initiative and the profit motive could make it all happen sooner than
currently thought. What is certain is that the journey back to the Moon has
already begun.

With appropriately directed enthusiasm, all of this will be achieved in the
private sector, driven by market forces -- without grumbling taxpayers,
without subsidies, without the 'guidance' of a central planning agency --
for much less cost than grandiose governmental efforts. Giant political
leaps failed, but small private steps will not. There's just too much money
to be made. That's why, thirty years from now, there will be regular flights
to the Moon, and a refueling base, and even colonies. And perhaps well
before that time, there will be an intrepid lunar entrepreneur with enough
vision to say, "Next Stop: Mars."
