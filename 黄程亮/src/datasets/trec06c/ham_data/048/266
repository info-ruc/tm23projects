Subject: Linking HB with UART 
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

    Recently , i am trying to use HB as the controller for a Remote
control project . However , i have yet to figure out how to make the HB
take in a 8 bit digital signal from the UART?Is there any circuit
require to execute the describe function?
    i am trying to send control signal from the joystick over the air
using UART . At the receiver end , the UART will receive the signal and
pump into the HB which will then decide to move the motor or steer it
left or right. Alternatively , is there any alternative besides using
HB? Just wonder can i achieve remote controlling a vehicle without using
any micro controller at all...

    Anyone has any ideas how it should be done . Thanks anyway
