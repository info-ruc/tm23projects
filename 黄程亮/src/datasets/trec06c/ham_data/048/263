Yes. You missed the "with a hole at the bottom connected to the water"
which means that water comes in as you move the air to the reservoir.
And this means reducing the effective volume of the submersible but
keeping its weight. Just the same as the piston system but using an
compressor instead of the piston (which in fact acts as compressor, right?).
If you open a valve, you let the air flow back to the tank, forcing the water 
out -> increasing the effective volume.

I saw it at a local r/c model store. Not cheap, about $700 a pair
(if you have two, one at the front, one aft, you can trim the sub).
