I think you want 9600, not 921kbaud (unless you're running your 6811 E
clock at 500 MHz).

>   newtio.c_cflag = BAUDRATE | CRTSCTS | CS8 | CLOCAL | CREAD;

No point turning on RTS/CTS flow control--those pins are not driven by
the handyboard.  Depending on your cabling, this may be causing your
problem (lack of CTS-high at the PC end).

See also the Linux "Serial-Programming-HOWTO".
