-- Hello.

I hope you can help. I'm using IC 3.1 for Linux and am having a problem
with structs.

I had code which ran fine under gcc, but ic hates it.
I've got an array of pointers to a strct,

struct SOFM *ptrSOM[4]

and then within the program
for (j=0; j<4; j++)
        function_call(ptrSOM[j])

but the compiler sees this as a pointer to an array, rather an element
of an array of pointers. 

Very grateful if you have any ideas,

Stephen
