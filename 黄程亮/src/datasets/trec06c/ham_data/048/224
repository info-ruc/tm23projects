It wouldnt be wise to directly connect your 12V supply to the Handy Board...
even if it doesnt cause damage to your Handy Board, I dont think your motor
will be able to draw sufficient current from the motor port to run properly.
Rather, you could bend out the motor supply pin of the L293 from the IC
socket
and solder your 12V supply there......

It shouldnt be a problem with the motor if you are able to move it.......
It would be more likely that the supply used to power the motor is not
producing
enough current to run the motor with the desired torque......(esp the case
if you
are using alkali or even Ni-cad batteries).
Try using a variable supply to see if the motor is really able to run your
car before
resorting to changing your motor to another with higher voltage and current
specs.

Hope this helps.....
