Hi -
   We are building a submersible robot. For maintaning the depth we need a
ballast system, we are planning to use a canister of compressed air with
some electronnically controlled valves. 
In addition we are planning to use a depth sensor, Pressure gauge, Digital
compass for navigation of the robot.
Also we would like to know any more ideas to acheive neutral bouyancy.

If anybody has suggestions on which ones are usable with the handyboard,
please let us know.

Ravi.
