Hi all,

After reading this Tilt Sensor message I had a look at www.analog.com  and
found they did samples of the chip. I got two samples the other day and so
made a quick test pcb. The board seems to work ok looking at it with a scope
but now I want
to interface it with my handyboard. The board basically produces a square
wave  signal with a duty cycle of 50/50 and as you tilt
the board the duty cycle changes. I want to measure the timing of the pulses
to determine any change in the duty cycle. Could this
be written in C or does it have to be in ASM and does anyone have any sample
code on how to do timing measurements on
the handyboard.

Thanks Russ....

I just came across this today:
http://www.analog.com/iMEMS/products/ADXL202_top.html

It tells how to make a tilt-sensor joystick for your home computer.  This
simple circuit is based on the ADXL202 accelerometer made by Analog Devices
(www.analog.com).  It looks like this chip would also be a very easy way to
integrate tilt/stability sensing into a walker with a brain as simple as a
Basic Stamp.

Basic Specs:
   Separate sensing of x and y with a 60-90 plus and minus range.
   Runs off 2.7-5.25 V,  ~1mA, 5 milli-g Resolution

I know this isn't new, just thought this was an neat product application,
and I'd be interested in hearing from anyone who's used the ADXL202 for
robotics.

Thanks,
