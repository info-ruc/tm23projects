  You'll want to use two items for each presentation and if you are using
scrambling you'll want a group size of two.  First item is just an
instruction and the second is a regular response gathering item:

0 "beginning of a sentence";
+1 "last item" * ;
0 "beginning of another sentence";
+2 "last item" * ;
