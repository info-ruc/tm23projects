Hi Again,

I've been trying to get two stepper motors to work with my HB, with little
success.
Firstly the software by Peter Harrison does not seem to compile when I try
to load it to the Board.
The error is in line 29; " int left_step_table[cycle_length] =
{48,49,51,50}; " - IC brings up a syntax error.
Looking through the IC manual, I see that there should be no number between
the square brackets, or am I wrong?
when I remove the cycle_length IC brings up a whole lot of errors, mostly
type incompatibilities.
Also is there any way of boosting the current capabilities of the board
without replacing the L293D's ?

I am also looking for a replacment for the ZTX614, as no company seems to
sell it in my area.
Thanks in advance.
Ross
