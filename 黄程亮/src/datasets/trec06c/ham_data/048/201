There is some recent theoretical work suggesting that gamma-ray
bursts are non-isotropic, meaning that they do not radiate
equally in all directions.  These models claim that gamma-ray
bursts happen when a massive star in a particular mass range
undergoes a core collapse; a black home forms in the core, an
accretion disk forms around the black hole from matter that has
not yet fallen into the core, and the accretion disk creates two
extremely energetic relativistic particle beams perpendicular to
the disk.  These blast through the outer layers of the star and
create the gamma-ray burst when they impact the interstellar
medium.  So from two directions you can see a gamma-ray burst,
but from other directions the star looks mostly like a normal
supernova.

If this is true then gamma-ray burst events are even more common, 
but we can see only those whose beams point at us.  However, it
is then unlikely that gamma-ray bursts can sterilize galaxies.

I have heard other claims that our large moon influenced the
development of life on this planet, but your summary of Guillermo
Gonzalez's claim that intelligent life is somehow connected to
the presense of solar eclipses doesn't even attempt to speculate
why these necessarily have to be connected.

Hello all,

For another possible explanation for GRB's, click this link:
 www.rideau.net/~gaasbeek/index.html#contents . This puts you on the
index page, in case you'd like to check out the other papers. From
there, scroll down to the table of contents and click on paper number 4,
"Frames of Reference: Part Two". Look for the discussion on observation
of superluminal stars, and you'll find what I'm talking about.

This guy seems to make sense, and I think his work deserves a serious
look, especially since he's good enough about it to include his
equations. I'd just be curious to hear some of your reactions to it.

Keep looking up,

Curtis

The importance or our ozone layer is grossly over stated now a adays..  If 
our ozone layer were eliminated, it would be as if we all moved 100 miles 
closer to the equator.  Also radiation forms ozone.

On the other hand having half an ecosphere burned off would have to trash the 
rest of the planet.  Certainly enough to crash a civilization for a while, 
but not enough to kill off intelligent lifeforms.

A variation of this is the idea even milder burst could crash an interstellar 
civilization.  Right now cosmic rays are a major limitation on life in space 
due to the radiation.  But since we know about it we can design our ships and 
platforms to deal with it.  But it seems cosmic rays are intermittent.  If we 
"came out" during a millennia of low space rad.  We might have a major 
interstellar civilization, and see it all destroyed when a few century cosmic 
ray storm whipes out space travelers.  The result could crash civilization 
everywhere.  Perhaps were just the first ones out who knew what to expect?

This seems iffy, but the weird nature of our moon could be significant.  Thou 
I find it hard to believe its the only way to evolve a intelligent race?  One 
could just as easily decide one needed to be on a moon of a jovian since 
close in to most stars the radiation and orbital stability are to bad.

True, we haven't more then poor clues, and most of them don't add up to the 
empty skies we see around us.  Any of these ideas at most mean their should 
be fewer folks out their coming here.  But we have no sign that anyone EVER 
came to earth!  The statistics of that are low, which is frightening.

But again the numbers are guesses.  You assume few stars grow starsystems, 
and very few have environments where life can grow.  There ae multiple 
autonomous ecosystems on earth, only ours needs to worry about solar energy 
or weather.  Those based on the volcanic chemistry of deep ocean vents, or 
deep under ground are now thought to be far larger then our photosynthesis 
based ecosphere.  The deep ocean vent environment is thought to exist on at 
least one moon in our solar system, and that's out in the jovian belt.  This 
strongly suggests our biases toward the "life belt" based on solar heating 
and photosphere may just be our prejudice. 

Why assume folks only retain communication abilities for a thousand years.  
We've retained writing for about 5 times as long.  Abilities to build boats 
and simple buildings and weapons for a couple times that.  Given the value of 
high tech and spaced based industry and resources, I could see this stuff 
being a high priority for retention.

A better question is why would one do SETI communications.  If your curious 
about the stars.  Most won't have anyone to answer your call.  Sending probes 
or expeditions could be far more effective, and get info back a lot faster 
then waiting for someone to answer your call.  I'm beginning to think the 
basic assumption of SETI, that folks would always prefer transmitting and 
waiting, rather then scouting about and looking for themselves.  Give the 
ridiculous waits necessary to check out any stars, especially if you need to 
wait for a civilization to evevolve to answer your call.

Bottom line, we don't know (even in vague ways) how likly biosphere's, 
intelligence, muchless technical civilizations are.  They could be virtually 
the norm for any chemically active planet that hangs around a few billion 
years.  One per solar system could be virtually unknown.  

Or they might almost never happen, and you hardly ever have more then a 
handful of civilization active in a galaxy at one time.

Or perhaps the nanotech/singularity folks are right and past our level of 
tech things explode dramatically.  A couple centuries from now our 
desendanscould be so advanced they'd be little more interested in contacting 
us, as we'd have to go visit ants.

But you're forgetting...we DO visit ants...at least the myrmecologists do.
But they don't talk to them...they just study them. Perhaps that is the
explanation (as I have said before) for why no one is here. They wouldn't
come for technology, or anything like that. The only thing they could
conceivably be interested in with us would be how we behave, and how we are
put together. To study that, you need not make contact. Plus, it makes
psychological studies much easier. If you want to know how people are put
together, you send down microscopic probes to investigate. Granted, this
might not be the goal of every civilization, but it could explain many.

No, it doesn't change the end result at all as far as the equation is
concerned. It just means that there are more of them to make up the
difference. Statistically, the end result is the same. We seem to have just
been extremely lucky in that none have been pointed our way in somewhat more
than the allotted amount of time.

True, it wasn't germane to my point. Actually Gonzalez doesn't really say
that there is a casual connection. Only that a large moon is required to
stabilize a planet's normally erratic orbital tendencies and that left
unstabilized, wild rotational shifts would cause sufficient climatic
instability to discourage the rise of complex life forms. An examination of
our own climatic past lends credence to this theory. The relatively few
problems the Earth has undergone have resulted in wholesale extinctions -
particularly among higher life forms.

I would think that the odds might actually be somewhat better. The theory
does not allow for twin planets rotating around a common center. I am not
certain that this arrangement would not be tidally locked however.

Actually, plenty are pointed our way -- otherwise we wouldn't
keep detecting them so frequently.

Statistically, though, the result is not the same.  On a
universe-wide scale, there are plenty of gamma-ray bursts for
everyone to see.  If GRBs are isotropic, then, yes, potentially
each burst we see has sterilized a large portion of its host
galaxy.  But if GRBs aren't isotropic, then individual GRBs
aren't sterilizing huge parts of the galaxies they occur in, and
at a galaxy-wide scale there aren't enough close GRBs to clear
galaxies of life.

As I understood your original response, you were saying that GRBs might be
anisotropic - which means to me we only see GRBs aimed directly at us. The
sterilization theory was based upon the OBSERVED incidence of GRBs and is
not materially affected by this change. Regardless of whether a particular
GRB is aimed at us or away from us (anisotropic) the summation of all GRBs
must be isotropic. Which means there are a great many GRBs that we never
see, in fact the majority of them are never seen. Either way, the statistics
are the same and the conclusion reached is the same. The only thing that has
changed is the number of GRBs that occur in order to perform the same act -
sterilization of large segments of the galaxy.

The statistics aren't necessarily the same, Lee.

Note that for as many GRBs as are visible us, our planet isn't
sterilized yet; that's because none of them are occurring within
our galactic neighborhood.  If GRBs are anisotropic then
relatively few star systems will be in the path of the GRB beams
and close enough to be affected; other nearby star systems will
see the supernova but not be inundated with gamma radiation.  A
lot more star systems will be far enough away to be in line with
the beams and see them without being sterilized by the radiation.

Unfortunately I don't know the exact "beam spread" predicted in
the theoretical models such that it would be possible to estimate
the number of GRBs that are occurring that we can't see directly
(although many supernovae we see may be producing them) or the
likelihood of being zapped by a GRB.  I'm quite sure, however,
than in the anisotropic case the probability of being zapped by a 
GRB is much lower than in the isotropic case.

Washington post ran an article on A real-estate and hotel guy offering
to put up half a billion for him lunar orbiting hotel concept.

"It's up to private enterprise to get the general public into space in
our lifetimes," [Robert] Bigelow said in a weighty tone, as though he
alone were carrying this burden. "It is imperative that we create
user-friendly, market-driven projects like this one or it will never

Of course he hired Greg Bennett (ex NASA flight planer, current 'Artemis

Human Trip To Water-Rich Asteroid Possible By 2015
ITHACA, N.Y. (Reuters) - Human beings could go prospecting on a tiny,
water-rich asteroid and return samples to
Earth by 2015, much sooner than any possible human mission to Mars,
astronomers said Monday.

The water-rich asteroid -- a lumpy ball about 100 feet in diameter
called 1998 KY26 -- could serve as a sort of
cosmic filling station for space travelers, ``a space station waiting
for occupants,'' according to Steven Ostro of
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Asteroid Offers Oasis For Space Explorers- Report
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A rapidly spinning asteroid that passed close to
Earth last
                     year offers an ``oasis for future space explorers''
because it is loaded with water,
astronomers said Friday.

An international team of astronomers in the Czech Republic, Hawaii,
Arizona and California pointed radar and
optical telescopes at Asteroid 1998 KY26 when it passed about 500,000
miles (800,000 km) from the Earth in June
1998.

Reporting in the journal Science, they said they found that the 100-foot
(30-meter) object spins -- rotating every 11
minutes -- but more importantly, they found it is loaded with ice.

NASA Space funding was cut ~ 1.4B$ (10%),
"essentially gutting NASA's space science programs."

             Latest on Congressional NASA, DOD RLV Funding

Our current alert (see www.space-access.org/updates/alt0799b.html)
asks you to contact any members of the House or Senate
Appropriations committees local to you, and ask them to A: add $50
million to NASA Future-X for reusable rocket low-cost flight ops
demonstrations, and B: as a matter of priorities, do NOT fund
startup of the premature and oversold "Spaceliner 100" airbreathing
launcher project.

The Senate NASA appropriators (the HUD, VA, and Independent Agencies
subcommittee, then the full Appropriations committee) were scheduled
to "mark up" their NASA funding bill last week, but they once again
postponed.  Keep after them, but save the phone charges and use
paper mail - all they'll say about when they will actually do markup
is "before the August recess", which starts August 6th.  That
narrows things down to either this coming week, or the week after,
and we'd guess at the current pace the week after (starting Monday
August 2nd) is more likely.  So if you haven't yet gotten around to
contacting them, or if you did but via voice phone, get their DC
office address from www.vote-smart.org, buy a stamp, and send them a
letter first thing this week - it'll likely get there in time.

The House HUD/VA appropriations bill, as of last Thursday, was still
scheduled for subcommittee markup this Monday July 26th, late in the
day.  So if your Congressman is on Appropriations and you haven't
yet contacted him or her, phone or fax Monday!  See the alert at
www.space-access.org for details on how.

Over in the Defense Department budget, we're pushing for funding for
the X-40B "Space Maneuver Vehicle" (SMV), a spacegoing version of
the USAF Phillips Lab X-40A landing-only reusable upper stage
demonstrator flown successfully last winter.  X-40B will demonstrate
a variety of reusable space-launch, on-orbit, and reentry operations
we and the USAF think very useful, operations complementary to what
NASA plans to do with the related X-37.

We and various like-minded folk have been working this one for a
while - the Senate Defense Appropriation was passed weeks ago with
$25 million for this project.  Last week the House marked up and
passed its version of the DOD funding bill with surprising speed -
with nothing for SMV in it, oops.

We've been given to understand that there is support for USAF SMV
among the House Appropriators, and that it is possible they'll
accede to the Senate position of $25 million funding when it comes
time for the two to hammer out their differences in conference. We
don't know when the Defense Appropriations conference will happen,
though we suspect (for arcane tactical reasons) it may take place
untraditionally early, within the next two weeks.  As soon as we
know the timing for sure, we're going to be asking your help pushing
hard for full funding for X-40B.
________________________________________________________________________

         Rotary Rocket Flies ATV, Does Second Round of Layoffs

Rotary Rocket Company at about 8:30 am PDT on Friday July 23rd flew
their Roton ATV for the first time, doing multiple rotor-borne
liftoffs, low-altitude hovers, and landings over the course of
several minutes.  The ATV is Rotary's "Aerial Test Vehicle",
intended to demonstrate structures, systems, and the rotor-borne
landing mode for the company's planned Roton reusable launch
vehicle.  This initial flight took place several months behind the
original (very aggressive) schedule - late, but not in our view
unusually so, given the leanness of the budget (Rotary built and
flew the ATV on $30 million total funding that we know of) and the
universality of Murphy's Law - development projects *always* take a
little longer than the engineers expect.

Unfortunately, Rotary seems to have run low on shoestring - their
ATV flight coincided with the effective date of their second round
of layoffs.  We have not been able to get a definitive answer on the
scope of the latest round of layoffs (we observe that even for
companies in trouble, not being straight with the press is
counterproductive) but it seems likely based on what we have been
able to dig out that absent an immediate infusion of cash, Rotary is
at best in mothballs and at worst is history.
________________________________________________________________________

Miscellany

  - United Space Alliance (USA), the Boeing/Lockheed-Martin Shuttle
operating consortium, is sponsoring the Space Shuttle Development
Conference at NASA Ames, Moffet Field CA (actual site seems to be
the Westin Santa Clara) with an all-star cast, Wednesday July 28th
through Friday July 30th, 1999.  The general theme of the conference
seems to be the prospects for continuing Shuttle operations for
decades to come.  Information at www.futureshuttle.com; media
registration contact is Jack King at 407 861-4358.

  - The US Department of Defense has adopted its first major new
space policy in a while - one key point being that we will treat
space a lot more like we treat the sea and international airspace,
as a medium where we support freedom of navigation and we will
defend US assets, another point being that we will be pushing toward
more flexible lower-cost space operations, both unmanned and
potentially (if the cost comes down enough) manned.

  - And finally for this Update, Rotary Rocket isn't the only outfit
on a too-short shoestring.  Information warfare in support of
radically cheaper space transportation costs a whole lot less than
actually developing hardware, but it still costs.  If you like what
we're doing and you want to see more, money is the sincerest form of
flattery.  An SAS membership is $30, and gets you a discount on our
annual conference (Space Access '00, April 27-29, 2000, in Phoenix
Arizona) plus direct email subscription to our Updates and Alerts.

Yes, we give away our Updates and Alerts promiscuously - Job #1 is
to get across our point of view.  No, we don't incessantly nag SAS
members to renew or donors to give more - we're old-fashioned enough
to think that's rude.  No, donations to SAS are not tax-deductible -
we do far too much lobbying to qualify for 501c3 tax-deductible
status without lying like rugs, and regardless of how common this
may be we won't do it.  And no, we won't take donations from
government contractors that might be affected by our positions; that
way lies self-censoring impotence as the next big corporate check
gets ever more important.  We've seen that, we won't do it.

Given the above self-imposed restrictions, it's a tribute to our
supporters that we're still here and fighting after seven years.
We've seen checks for five bucks, we've seen a blessed few for a
thousand.  Money translates very directly to time and energy - we
thank you every one for all you've given over the years.

It's settling into a long grinding struggle, alas.  Please, help us
stick with it.  Send your checks to SAS, 4855 E Warner Rd #24-150,
Phoenix AZ 85044.

Space Science Political Alert #2.     Thursday 29 July 1999.

>From: Tim Kyger

One more long message.sorry!

Cross-posting of the data contained in this message is strongly encouraged.
Post it where ever you wish, and in as many places as you can.  Please!

You may get multiple copies of this.  Once again...sorry!  I'm working as
fast as I can...

The Prospect Before Us.
The shoe has finally dropped.  On Monday 26 July, at the House of
Representatives' Committee on Appropriations' Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and
Independent Agencies met and marked their FY '00 VA/HUD bill.

NASA's budget was, as predicted, eviscerated; its science programs were cut
by roughly a billion dollars, with an overall cut of $1.325 billion dollars.

A detailed rundown of these budget cuts, along with specifics as to what
programs would die as a result, follows later in this Alert.  There's also a
Pork Report; the VA/HUD Appropriators made lots of cuts, but you may be sure
that they took good care of themselves and their districts..!

But first.the full House Appropriations Committee will meet at 9:30 am on
Friday, 30 July, to adopt and markup a FY '00 VA/HUD appropriations bill.

This means that all of us have today - Thursday - to call, write, and/or fax
appropriate Members of House Appropriations.

Start with the Chairman of the full Committee --

C.W. Bill Young (R-FL10)
202/225-5961 vox
202/225-9764 fax
813/893-3191 district office
2407 Rayburn House Office Building
Washington DC 20515

Remember that letters have much more clout than a phone call, and email has
the least clout of all.  It is strongly suggested that a letter be written
and then faxed to Mr. Young's office.  A draft letter that may be used to
model your letters is also attached, and further supporting material may
also be found later in this Alert.

Follow up your letter to Mr. Young with a letter to Mr. Obey, the Ranking
Democrat on the full Committee --

David R. Obey (D-WI7)
202/225-3365 vox
202/225-3240 fax
715/842-5606 district office
2314 Rayburn House Office Building

After you finish with Mssrs. Young and Obey, fax a letter (if you haven't
already) to Mssrs. Walsh and Mollohan

James Walsh (R-NY25) VA/HUD Subcommittee Chair
202/225-3701 vox
202/225-4-42 fax
315/423-5657 district office
2351 RHOB
rep.james.walsh@mail.house.gov email address
www.house.gov/walsh/ web site

Alan B. Mollohan (D-WV1) VA/HUD Subcommittee RMM
202/225-4172 vox
202/225-7564 fax
304/232-5390 district office
2346 RHOB

Make your anger at these disastrous cuts known to your representatives!

Remember that these cuts won't be sustained until and unless the President
signs a VA/HUD appropriations bill into law that actually has such a cut -
and that is a long fight away from happening yet.  We can still win this.

Once you're done with the four gentlemen just noted, if you can, fax a
letter to each and every Member of the House Appropriations Committee who
isn't on the VA/HUD Subcommittee. They may be the swing votes needed to
reverse these cuts in full Committee.  A list of names and fax numbers may
be found at the end of this Alert.

Timing.
As noted, the full House Appropriations Committee meets tomorrow; and
sometime next week the full House will vote on the VA/HUD appropriation.

This means that we have a chance to amend this bill on the House floor to
turn back these cuts.  Stay tuned; this will be the core of Alert Number
Three...

In the meantime, the Senate VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee might mark at
any time from this moment on.  It may mark this next week, for example.  But
it also may wait to mark until after the August Congressional "work period."
This is the most probable way that events will run, giving us four or so
weeks to work our will upon the Members of the Senate.

So keep your fax machines fired up.  Keep ready to write and fax a mess of
letters to Senators.

Let's Not Forget The Vice President.
To recap, Vice President Al Gore is running for President.

Here's what Gore had to say on 20 July 1999 at the National Air and Space
Museum upon awarding the Apollo 11 crew the Langley Medal: "I am deeply
committed to an aggressive, forward-looking space program, a space program
that dares to push the limits of the heavens."

Let's hold him to his statement.  He can start by working to turn these cuts
around.

Vice President Gore can best be reached at the following address:

Vice President Albert Gore, Jr.
Room S-212
United States Capitol
Washington DC 20510

Fax your letters to:  202/224-0291.

Al Gore's email address is:  vice.president@whitehouse.gov

His web site is:       www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/OVP/html/GORE_home.html

The fax number at the Old Executive Office Building for Gore is:
       202/456-2685.

Fax him a letter right after you fax letters to the House Appropriations
critters.


Into The Ovens.
The $2.5 billion Space Station budget got cut by $150 million - a pro forma
cut so Appropriators could say that they hadn't not cut Space Station.

Ditto Space Shuttle, which suffered a $100 million cut to a $2.5474 billion
budget request.

The VA/HUD folks also noted that they'd be just overjoyed, as this process
goes forward this year, to entertain funding requests for additional Shuttle
system upgrades.  Reusable Flyback Booster program, funded by space science
cuts, anyone?

The "Science, Aeronautics and Technology" or "SAT" combined budget line for
FY '00 of a requested $5.4247 billion was cut by $849 million; but this cut
was entirely made against NASA's science programs, instead of against the
entire five and a half billion SAT budget. NASA's FY '00 space science line
item request was for $2.1966, and that line suffered a cut of $640.8
million.  Killed outright was the SIRTIF mission (a cut of $100.8 million)
as well as the CONTOUR Discovery Program mission (a cut of $50 million).

Here's where you have to dig and where the Appropriators don't want anybody
to know exactly what they've killed.

A cut of $60 million was made to "Explorer Future Planning," which had bee
requested to be $107.7 million (and which was $78.6 million in '99).  This
seemingly innocuous cut results in the cancellation of the HESSI and GALEX
"SMEX" missions, as well s the CHIPS and IMEX "UNIX" Explorer missions.  And
don't forget to erase the TWINS and PLEXAS missions; they're gone now, too.

In other words, the Explorer program is over, after a forty two year run.

A cut of $60 million was made to "Discovery Program Future Planning."  This
had been requested to be funded at $78.5 million (it was $19.7 million in '
99).  This results in the stillborn death of the Deep Impact mission as well
as the MESSENGER Mercury orbiter.

A cut of $75 million (to $114.8 million) was made to "Mars Surveyor Program
Future Planning."  Stillborn again, then, is *every* mission after Mars '01.

And if I were the Mars '01 folks, I wouldn't get comfortable just yet
either.

The "Supporting Research and Technology Program" was requested to be funded
at $1.1521 billion; $320 million is cut -- $200 million from the "Technology
Program," and $120 million from "Research."  The Research cut is a simple
one to explain - there just simply won't be any money to make sense out of
any data by ongoing space missions.  The $200 million Technology Program cut
is less obvious, but it results in deep, grave damage nonetheless.  What
dies as a result of this cut is the Space Interferometry Mission; the Next
Generation Space Telescope; The Planet Finder mission; any future missions
to Europa; the proposed Pluto flyby; STEREO, Solar-B, CONSTELLATION-X,
GLAST, FIRST, Solar Probe, and last, but not least, Space Technology-3.
(ST-4, as you'll recall, was recently cancelled by NASA.  Reminds you of the
good old days, though, doesn't it?)

But wait!  There's more!  We move on to the cuts in NASA's earth science
enterprise.

NASA's FY '00 earth science program budget request was $1.4591 billion, and
it was cut by a total of $285 million.  Al Gore's GLOBE program, $5 million,
as well as Triana, $35 million, are gone. LightSAR, $20 million, is
canceled, too. An additional $45 million was then cut from the Earth Probes
program, taking it from a requested level of $138.2 million to $38.2 million
(Triana and LightSAR were Earth Probes).

But at least the Earth Probes budget has some bucks left; the VA/HUD
appropriators eliminated outright the Earth System Science Pathfinders
program (a cut of $75.2 million), which kills the GRACE and PICASSO
missions, as well as the Vegetation Canopy Lidar mission and the CloudSat
mission.  Gone, too, is Volcam.

The Earth Observing System line is reduced by $150 million from its
requested level of $663.2 million, with $60 million being taken from the
"Technology Infusion" program, which for FY '00 was requested to be $77.6.
This kills Earth Observer-2, the "SPARCLE" mission outright.  $40 million is
cut from algorithm development ($127.4 million in FY '00), and, finally, the
$53.9 "EOS Follow-On" effort is cut by $50 million.  As the parting shot,
the EOSDIS budget request of $231.5 million is cut $50 million.

The House VA/HUD appropriators also made cuts to the "Mission Support" line
item, which had been requested to be $2.4949 billion, cutting it by $225.6
million.  The first cut is in "Construction of Facilities," where $67.1
million is cut from a $181 million budget request.  Next, $100 million is
cut from the $1.6469 billion "personal and related costs" account - layoffs
and firings!  Finally, "operations support" funding is reduced by $50
million from a budget request of $482.6 million.

But after cuts come...adds!

Pork Report.
Here's a list of all of the "adds" made by the VA/HUD appropriators in order
to make their bill fit under the balanced budget caps.  Makes you proud to
know that these folks are able to make those hard decisions to cut in order
to balance the budget, eh?

These adds.er.add up to a total of $119.8 million (!)..more than twice the
cost of the canceled CONTOUR mission (to pick just one example)!

The Big Picture On The VA/HUD Bill.
The VA/HUD appropriations bill funds 21 agencies.  The bill as written by
the House VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee totals $93.79 billion, of which
$23.334 billion was mandatory spending and $70.456 was "discretionary."  The
Administration's FY '00 budget request for this discretionary spending
totaled $72.06 billion, and included $2.48 billion in "emergency spending"
(bucks not subject to the budget caps) for FEMA.  The House bill includes
these emergency FEMA dollars, and it also includes $3 million in emergency
spending for veteran's health care.

The House VA/HUD appropriators added $1 billion to veteran's medical health
care of "normal" money, too, for a total of $18.3 billion.  The President
had asked for $17.3 billion, which was exactly the same amount that had been
appropriated in FY '99.

HUD got $2 billion more than in FY '99, but $2 billion less than the
President's FY '00 budget request: $26.1 billion.

EPA received $7.3 billion from the House VA/HUD critters, $106 million more
than the President asked for.

NSF got a mark of $3.646 billion for FY '00, $25 million less than it
received in FY '99.

FEMA got $3.36 billion for its FY '00 mark.

The remaining 14 agencies in the bill total up close to $2.3 billion
combined.

Model Letter to Use.
Dear [Fill in name of Representative or Senator]:

As a citizen vitally interested in my country's exploration of the solar
system, and in its pursuit of space science, I am extremely distressed over
Congress' intention to cut NASA's FY '00 science budget by $1.3 billion
dollars - the largest single cut in NASA's history!

NASA has sustained budget cuts for eight years in a row.  This proposed $1.3
billion cut would end science at NASA after the year 2000.  Is this the way
to welcome the 21st Century?

I urge you to totally reject this unprecedented cut and to fund NASA's
requested FY '00 budget in full.

Sincerely,

                      House Slashes NASA Budget

	NASA is facing some of its worst budget cuts in its history
after an appropriations subcommittee of the House of Representatives
voted Monday, July 26, to cut more than $1.3 billion, or nearly 10
percent, from the agency's proposed fiscal year 2000 budget.

	Although the full House Appropriations Committee voted
Friday, July 30 to restore $400 million to NASA's FY 2000 budget, the
agency is still facing a cut of more than $900 million from President
Clinton's original request and $1 billion from its 1999 budget.

	The original cuts disproportionately affected space science,
accounting for $640 million of the original $1.3 billion, or 29
percent of the original space science budget.  If enacted, the cuts
would have canceled the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF)
space telescope, the Contour comet mission, future Discovery and
Explorer missions, and Mars missions beyond 2001, as well as research
into future missions to Europa, Pluto, and elsewhere.

	The full House Appropriations Committee did vote to restore
$400 million to the space science budget by killing the Americorps
community service program.  That funding will be used to restore
SIRTF, Mars exploration, and some technology and research funds.

	Also heavily hit was NASA's earth sciences programs, with
$150 million cut into the Earth Observing System as well as
cancellation of the LightSAR radar mission and the Triana
Earth-observing camera.

	On the other hand, the space station and space shuttle
programs survived with a combined cut of just $250 million.  The
space station budget actually still increases from 1999 to 2000, but
only by $100 million instead of the planned $200 million.

	A chorus of protests, from NASA, members of Congress, and
space activists, was heard after the original cuts were announced.
"These cuts would gut space exploration," NASA administrator Dan
Goldin said. "They may force the closure of one to three NASA
centers, and significant layoffs would most certainly follow."

	Because the cuts are so tightly focused on Earth and space
sciences, the centers threatened with closure include the Jet
Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the Goddard Space Flight Center, two
facilities usually not considered prime targets for closure in the
past.

	"If NASA were faced with the reality of having more centers
than it needed, I would certainly expect JPL would be on the list,"
JPL deputy director Larry Dumas told the Pasadena Star-News
newspaper.

	Those claims were disputed by Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
chairman of the House Science Committee. "Their claims that NASA will
have to close centers and initiate layoffs... are disingenuous at
best and purposely inflammatory at worst," he claimed. "These are
scare tactics, pure and simple, and should be rejected as such."

	NASA's budget has been slowly but steadily declining
throughout Goldin's tenure as NASA administrator, but the proposed
cuts are far sharper than anything the agency has experienced before.
"Up until now, NASA has always stepped up to the budgetary challenge.
This time the NASA team plans to fight," Goldin said.  "I won't feel
better until every nickel is restored."

	The National Space Society issued an alert asking its members
to contact members of the House Appropriations Committee. "We cannot
stand by and allow the House of Representatives to act so
irresponsibly and play politics with the future of our national space
program," the society said in a statement.

	The full House of Representatives is expected to take up the
appropriations bill this week.  The Senate has yet to act on
appropriations legislation for the space agency, and may not do so
until after the August recess.  President Clinton has also promised
in the past to veto any appropriations bill that did not include
funding for his Americorps program, a potential stumbling block for
NASA funding. The long legislative process ahead means there is still
time for funding to be restored, or additional cuts to be made.

	"This is only the beginning of the process," Rep. James Walsh
(R-NY), chair of the appropriations subcommittee that made the
initial devastating cuts, told the Associated Press. "We're at about
the bottom of the third in a nine-inning ball game."



                  Shuttle Deploys Chandra Telescope

	Despite some problems during launch, the shuttle Columbia
successfully completed its mission last month to deploy the Chandra
X-Ray Telescope.

	Columbia lifted on on mission STS-93 at 12:31 am EDT (0431
UT) Friday, July 23.  The launch had been delayed one day by
thunderstorms, and two days before that when a sensor erroneously
detected a buildup of hydrogen in an engine compartment seven second
before liftoff.

	The crew, commanded by Eileen Collins, the first woman to
command a shuttle mission, completed its primary task seven hours
after launch when it deployed the Chandra X-Ray Telescope.  The
telescope's Inertial Upper Stage (IUS) fired perfectly one hour
later, placing the telescope in an elliptical orbit.  The telescope's
onboard thrusters have been tweaking the orbit into its final
version, between 10,000 and 140,000 km (6,200 and 87,000 mi.) above
the Earth.

	After the telescope was deployed, the five-person crew turned
their attention to a suite of secondary experiments, ranging from a
small ultraviolet telescope mounted in the shuttle to a test of a new
hinge for deploying solar arrays to biological tests on the effects
of microgravity.

	While much of the attention during the early phase of the
mission focused on Chandra and on Collins, later on in the mission
the focus changed to a series of problems that took place during the
launch.  A short circuit five seconds after launch disabled the
controllers for two of the three main engines.  Backup controllers
took over, but additional malfunctions would have shut down at least
one of the engines, requiring an abort and emergency landing.

	At a post-flight press conference, Collins said she
originally thought the warning lights that appeared when the
controllers failed were more ordinary lights she had seen on previous
launches, then reconsidered when mission controllers advised her and
pilot Jeff Ashby to shut down other systems in an effort to keep them
from being taken out by the short.

	"I thought, 'This isn't right, this isn't what I was
expecting,'" Collins said. "The next thoughts that are going through
my mind are, 'What's our abort capability? If we lose an engine,
where are we going to go?'"

	At the end of the launch, the main engines shut down a
split-second early, placing the shuttle in an orbit 11 km (7 mi.)
lower than planned.  The early shutdown was traced to a leak of
hydrogen coolant from one of the main engine nozzles during launch
(see accompanying article below.)

	The launch problems had no effect on the landing, which took
place at 11:20 pm EDT July 27 (0320 UT July 28) at the Kennedy Space
Center.



               Loose Plug Caused Shuttle Hydrogen Leak

	A loose plug fell through an engine nozzle, puncturing three
coolant tubes and causing the hydrogen leak noticed during the STS-93
shuttle mission, NASA investigators said Friday, July 30.

	According to investigators, the plug, used to seal a liquid
oxygen injector tube, fell off as the main engines on the shuttle
Columbia were ignited six seconds before liftoff.  The engine thrust
accelerated the tiny plug, no larger than a small nail, to supersonic
speeds as it crashed into the size of the nozzle, weakening the tubes
and causing them to rupture.

	The ruptured tubes allowed liquid hydrogen, used to cool the
engine nozzles before being consumed as fuel by the engines
themselves, to leak from the shuttle.  More than 1,000 kg (2,200
lbs.) of hydrogen leaked out during the ascent into orbit.

	The leak caused the engine to run up to 55 degrees Celsius
(100 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer than normal, in turn consuming an
additional 1,800 kg (4,000 lbs.) of liquid oxygen.  That led to the
shutdown of the main engines a split-second early, placing the
shuttle in an orbit 11 km (7 mi.) lower than planned.

	Shuttle officials said that the leak could not have caused an
explosion, and did not immediately endanger the shuttle.  However, if
the leak had been larger, the engine temperature would have increased
to the point where the engine shut down, forcing an emergency landing
either back at the Kennedy Space Center or the transatlantic abort
site in Africa.

	Bill Gerstenmaier, shuttle program manager, told Florida
Today that 20 to 40 coolant lines would have had to rupture to
overheat and shut down the engine.

	The plug that damaged the coolant lines was one of two
installed to plug a small injector tube, one of several hundred that
feed liquid oxygen into the main engine.  The tube had become damaged
and was plugged to prevent oxygen from leaking and inadvertently
mixing with liquid hydrogen.  The other plug held, NASA officials
said.

	An investigation into the coolant leak and the exact series
of events that caused it is ongoing.  Also still under investigation
is an electrical short five seconds after launch that disabled two of
the six computers that serve as engine controllers.  Technicians are
expected to take some time to check Columbia's wiring to find the
exact location of the short circuit.

	It's not currently known if either problem will push back the
next shuttle launch, Endeavour's mid-September launch on STS-99, a
radar mapping mission.



               Lunar Prospector Ends Mission with Crash

	The Lunar Prospector spacecraft ended its highly-successful
18-month mission with a deliberate crash into a crater near the lunar
south pole July 31 in a search for water.

	Prospector crashed near the lunar south pole at 5:52 am EDT
(0952 UT) July 31, project officials reported.  The impact took place
a minute later that previously planned because a thruster burn early
Friday that placed the spacecraft in an elliptical orbit to prepare
for the impact was slightly stronger than planned.

	Neither amateurs nor professionals reported seeing a plume of
dust that some thought the spacecraft's impact would raise.  The fact
that no impact plume was seen, NASA officials said, actually
increases the likelihood that Prospector hit its desired impact site
deep within a shaded crater near the lunar south pole.

	Observations by a large group of terrestrial telescopes,
including the Keck Observatory and telescopes in Arizona and Texas,
as well as the Hubble Space Telescope and the Submillimeter Wave
Astronomy Satellite (SWAS), were made in a search for water that
would have been thrown up by the impact.  Analysis of the data is
expected to take up to several months.

	"Once again, Prospector has done everything we have asked of
it," said Alan Binder, principal investigator for Lunar Prospector.
"This mission provided ten times better data than we expected. The
spacecraft performed flawlessly to its very end."

	In its final days, the spacecraft had to survive a partial
lunar eclipse July 28 that kept the spacecraft out of the Sun for
several hours.  To conserve the limited battery power on the
spacecraft non-essential systems, including most of the scientific
instruments, were turned off.  Project officials said the spacecraft
made it through the eclipse with no problems.

	Prospector was crashed into the Moon at the end of its
18-month mission in an effort to directly detect any water ice that
is believed to be hidden in permanently-shadowed craters near the
lunar poles.  Prospector was targeted to impact in one such shadowed
area of a 50-km (30-mi.) crater near the lunar south pole, although
the exact site of impact was not known.

	Scientists cautioned that the odds of success for this impact
were small, no more than 10 percent, according to David Goldstein,
the University of Texas scientist who proposed the crash.  If water
was detected, however, it would lay to rest nearly all doubts that
ice exists at the lunar poles.

	Two Stanford University scientists earlier in July cautioned,
though, that any water near the lunar poles could be locked up in
hydrated minerals similar to concrete.  The impact, they believed
could librate water from those minerals that does not exist in free
form on or near the lunar surface.

	The crash also deposited on the Moon the ashes of the late
geologist Eugene Shoemaker, a pioneer in lunar research in the 1960s
who was killed in an auto accident in Australia two years ago.  A
sample of his cremated ashes were included on the Lunar Prospector
spacecraft, fulfilling a desire he had to travel to the Moon.



                Deep Space 1 Completes Asteroid Flyby

	NASA's Deep Space 1 spacecraft capped off its
technology-development mission with a successful flyby of a small
asteroid July 29, although a mispointed camera may mean no close-up
images of the asteroid.

	DS1 passed within about 15 kilometers (9 miles) of asteroid
9969 Braille, formerly known as 1992 KD, at 12:46 am EDT (0446 UT)
July 29.  Mission officials initially reported the flyby was a
success, returning images and other data about the small asteroid.

	However, mission scientists reported Thursday afternoon, July
29, that DS1's camera was misaimed during the closest portion of the
flyby and did not return any closeups of the asteroid.

	The spacecraft used an onboard navigation system called
AutoNav to guide itself past the asteroid safely.  AutoNav was one of
a dozen technologies tested by the spacecraft during the mission.

	"This is a dramatic finale to an amazingly successful
mission," said Marc Rayman, deputy mission manager.  "With AutoNav's
successful piloting of the spacecraft, we've completed the testing
and validation of the 12 new technologies onboard and possibly
acquired important science data, including photos."

	Mission officials later told the Associated Press that the
camera lost the asteroid about 20 minutes before closest approach,
when the spacecraft was still more than 16,000 km (10,000 mi.) from
the asteroid.

	"This is analogous to mispointing a camera and getting a
blank field of view," project scientist Robert Nelson told the AP.
Data from other instruments initially appeared to be okay, however.

	Later reports indicated that some infrared images were
obtained fairly close to, but not at, the time of closest approach.
No images have yet been released, but a press conference has been
scheduled for August 3 to report on the quantity and quality of the
science data returned during the flyby.

	The flyby was not without problems.  About 16 hours before
closest approach a software glitch triggered a "safing event", when
the spacecraft shut down nonessential systems and waited for
instructions from Earth.  The problem was corrected about six hours
later.

	"This has been by far the most challenging, dramatic and
stressful day on the project," said Rayman. "The last 16 hours before
the flyby were really, really exciting. We had the safing event, we
recovered from it and we managed to squeeze in a trajectory
correction maneuver to update Deep Space 1's flight path."

	Any scientific results will be considered an added bonus for
the mission, whose primary purpose is technology development.  Since
its launch in October, DS1 tested technologies ranging from an ion
engine to advanced solar panels to an autonomous control system.

	The mission is officially scheduled to end in September.
There has been past discussion of an extended mission, which would
include two comet flybys in 2001, but the precarious nature of NASA's
space sciences budget make the probability of obtaining such funding
unlikely.

	The asteroid received its new name just a few days before the
flyby.  The name was selected by the discoverers of the asteroid,
Eleanor Helin and David Lawrence, from a set of finalists chosen by a
Planetary Society panel as part of a competition run by the
organization.



                 Mir Cosmonauts Make Final Spacewalks

	Two Russian cosmonauts made two spacewalks late last month
that are likely to be the final spacewalks performed outside the Mir
space station.

	Cosmonauts Viktor Afanasyev and Sergei Avdeyev spent six
hours outside Mir on July 23 in a largely unsuccessful effort.  They
attempted to deploy a large Russian-Georgian antenna designed to
communicate with other satellites, but were unable to open the
antenna after an extended effort.

	They also attempted to search the exterior of part of the
station in a search for an air leak first noticed several weeks ago,
but were unable to locate the source of the leak.

	Afanasyev and Avdeyev performed a second spacewalk July 28.
During that five-hour, 22-minute spacewalk, they were finally able to
fully deploy the communications antenna.  They also also installed
equipment to study the effects of electric and magnetic fields on the
station, as well as equipment which the Russian Interfax news agency
described as being able to detect air leaks from the station,
although the two did not resume their search for an existing leak
from the station that they attempted in their previous spacewalk.

	During both spacewalks the third member of the Mir crew,
French cosmonaut Jean-Pierre Haignere, remained in the station and
monitored the progress of the spacewalkers.

	Russian officials downplayed any mention of the leak, saying
it was not serious to the current crew.  However, officials said a
week earlier that if the leak was not fixed, the station would be
uninhabitable within three months.

	That shouldn't pose a problem for the current crew, which is
now scheduled to depart the station August 28.  The station will be
left unoccupied after that, with the possible exception of a
short-term visit to Mir in December that Russian officials discussed
earlier this year.

	Unless private funding can be found, Russia will deorbit Mir
in early 2000 over the Pacific Ocean.



               Turbopump Failure Cause of Proton Crash

	A fire in the turbopump of one of the engines in the second
stage of a Proton booster caused it to crash several minutes after
launch July 5, Russian officials revealed this week.

	In an interview with the Russian Izvestia news service July
27, Anatoli Kiselev, Director-General of Khrunichev State Research,
said that a faulty weld in the turbopump triggered a fire which
destroyed the second stage and caused the rest of the booster to
crash downrange from its Baikonur, Kazakhstan launch site.

	"The fire was started by a stray aluminum particle in a seam
between the cover and the apparatus as a result of a defect in a
weld," Kiselev told Izvestia.  Such stray particles can be blown in
by a turbopump or enter though the fueling equipment as a result of
personnel neglect.

	Using "super advanced U.S. equipment" to simulate the
accident, Kiselev said a particle weighing as little as 0.2 grams is
sufficient to start a fire, and that a weld as little as 25 percent
below the norm can harbor such particles.

	Telemetry returned by the rocket showed that the first four
minutes and 37 seconds of its July 5th flight were normal.  At that
point, however, the number three engine of the second stage destroyed
itself in a fire, also taking out portions of the rear of the stage
and the bottom of the second stage fuel tank.  Within a half-second
the fuel and oxidizer tanks of the stage depressurized, destroying
the stage.

	The third stage and the Breeze-M upper stage, making its
inaugural flight, survived the destruction of the second stage but
did not have enough velocity to reach orbit.  Aerodynamic and heat
loads destroyed these stages at an altitude of 30 km (18 mi.),
scattering debris over portions of Siberia and Kazakhstan.

	Kiselev said the Russian State Commission investigating the
launch failure will recommend that the turbopump design be upgraded,
and a filter be added that can catch spurious particles that can
start such fires.  The fueling equipment may also be upgraded.

	"We were planning to perform all these upgrades in 2000
anyway, but this failure presses us to do it earlier than we
expected," Kiselev said.

	"An important thing is that this failure is of a singular
manufacturing nature," he added. "The failure has not lowered our
estimate of Proton reliability beyond the reference level," which is
a success rate of 96 percent.

	The timeframe for these upgrades, and the return to flight of
the Proton, is unknown.  Kiselev said he believes an additional four
Western payloads can be launched on Protons by the end of the year.
This would require Kazakhstan to lift its ban on Proton launches
which it put into place after the crash.  Negotiations between
Russian and Kazakhstan on the Proton ban are ongoing.

	A Proton will also be used late this year to launch the
Zvezda service module for the International Space Station.

	International Launch Services, the joint venture between
Lockheed Martin, Khrunichev, and Energia, said the Russian State
Commission will likely release their formal report on the launch
accident in the first or second week in August.  They released the
Izvestia report as they cannot share technical information with
Khrunichev until the U.S. federal government approves a license for
them to do so.



               Roton Prototype Makes First Flight Test

	A prototype of Rotary Rocket Company's Roton reusable launch
vehicle made its first test flight Friday, July 23, hovering a few
meters off the ground for several minutes.

	The Roton Atmospheric Test Vehicle (ATV) successfully
performed three takeoff and landing maneuvers during the flight test,
which lasted 4 minutes and 40 seconds, just under the planned
5-minute duration.  The Roton ATV hovered at an altitude of about 2.4
meters (8 feet) during the test, within the planned range of 1.5 to 3
meters (5 to 10 feet).

	"It is this demonstrated performance that provides
creditability to Rotary Rocket's aims of achieving low-cost space
flight," said Rotary Rocket president and CEO Gary Hudson.

	The flight test was performed with a crew of two onboard:
pilot Dr. Marti Sarigul-Klijn, a retired Navy commander and Roton
Chief Engineer, with Brian Binnie, also a retired Navy commander and
Roton Flight Test Director, as copilot.  Both are experienced test
pilots.

	The test flight took place Friday morning, July 23, at Rotary
Rocket's facilities in Mojave, California, but was not reported until
Wednesday, July 28.  Rotary officials had declined comment on the
test flight until Wednesday's announcement.

	The Roton ATV is a full-scale prototype designed to test the
flight characteristics of the Roton launch vehicle in the atmosphere,
particularly during approach and landing.  The vehicle has no rocket
engines but does have a helicopter-like rotor, with small thrusters
on the tips of the blades, that is used to propel the vehicle in the
atmosphere.

	The ATV will eventually be used on longer flights from
altitudes of over 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) to test the approach and
landing characteristics of the vehicle.  No timeline for those tests
were given by Rotary officials.

	A future test vehicle, the Roton PTV, will be used to test
the launch characteristics of the vehicle.  That version will
incorporate a rocket engine based on NASA's Fastrac engine under
development.  The company selected the Fastrac over its own RocketJet
engine design during a reorganization in June.

	The company plans to have the full version of the Roton
single-stage reusable launch vehicle enter commercial service in
2001, funding permitting.



         "Richter Scale" of Asteroid Impact Threats Announced

	The International Astronomical Union has officially endorsed
Thursday, July 22, a new system of communicating the threat of
potential collisions by near-Earth asteroids.

	The Torino Scale, endorsed by the IAU at the United Nations
UNISPACE III meeting in Vienna, is a 0-10 scale designed to easily
express the danger posed by a near-Earth asteroid collision.  The
scale is named after the Italian city where it was adopted by an IAU
working group in June.

	The scale is analogous to the Richter Scale used to measure
the intensity of earthquakes as well as similar scales to gauge the
strength of hurricanes and tornadoes.  However, the Torino scale
takes into account both the potential damage an asteroid could do as
well as the probability of a collision.

	On the Torino scale, an asteroid measuring 0 would have no
chance of hitting Earth, or would be unable to do reach the ground if
it encountered the Earth.  An asteroid measuring 10 would be certain
to hit the Earth and cause global damage.

	An 8, 9 or 10 on the Torino scale would correspond to a
certain collision of varying magnitudes.  Lower numbers would be used
to describe less certain impacts of varying strengths.

	Currently all known asteroids measure a 0 on the Torino
scale.  Some asteroids, such as 1999 AN10, at one time measured a 1
on the scale, meaning that they had about an equal probability of
striking the Earth as a random, undiscovered object of similar size.
These asteroid have been downgraded, though, after new observations
led to refined orbits that reduced or eliminated any impact
probability.

	The scale was developed by Richard Binzel, a planetary
astronomy professor at MIT, as a way to better communicate the real
dangers -- or lack of danger -- posed by near-Earth asteroids.
"Scientists haven't done a very good job of communicating to the
public the relative danger of collision with an asteroid," he said.
"The Torino scale should help us clearly inform but not confuse the
public."

	An asteroid impact, Binzel said, "is a case of a
high-consequence but low-probability event. It's difficult in human
nature to figure out what level of anxiety we should assign to an
approaching asteroid."

	The adoption of the Torino scale comes at a time when the
rate of near-Earth asteroid discoveries has sharply increased, thanks
to sophisticated detection systems like the LINEAR project at MIT's
Lincoln Laboratory and long-term searches like Spacewatch in Arizona.  

	The increased discovery rate has led to impact "scares" like
1999 AN10 this year and 1997 XF11 last year, when newly-discovered
asteroids were found to have small but non-zero impact probabilities
in the coming decades.  Those probabilities decreased after new
observations led to refined orbits.

	"What I find especially important about the Torino impact
scale is that it comes in time to meet future needs as the rate of
discoveries of near-Earth objects continues to increase," said Hans
Rickman, IAU Assistant General Secretary.

	Binzel hopes that the Torino scale will make as easy to
communicate the threat of an asteroid collision as the Richter scale
does to describe the intensity of an earthquake.  "If you tell a
Californian that an earthquake registering one on the Richter scale
was going to hit tomorrow, he would say, 'So what?'" he said. "If you
were talking about a six, that would be different."

Delta 2 Launch:  A Delta 2 successfully launched four more Globalstar
communication satellites early Sunday, July 25.  The Delta 2 lifted
off from pad 17A at Cape Canaveral at 3:46 am EDT (0746 UT), at the
beginning of the first of two available launch windows.  The launch
was the third Delta 2 launch of Globalstar satellites in a six-week
period, after launches on June 10 and July 10. A fourth launch, the
last in this cluster of launches, is planned for mid-August, after
the Cape Canaveral launch facilities are reopened after range
modernization work.  With the July 25 launch, 32 Globalstar
satellites are now in orbit, 20 from four Delta 2 launches and 12
from three Soyuz launches. Three more Soyuz and one more Delta 2 will
be used this fall to complete the 48-satellite constellation plus fly
four on-orbit spares.

Atlas 3 Loses Payload:  The first launch of Lockheed Martin's new
Atlas 3 booster will likely be delayed after it lost its first
payload to Ariane July 26.  Loral Space and Communications announced
that it would launch its Telstar 7 communications satellite on an
Ariane 4 in September, and not on the first flight of the Atlas 3A as
originally planned.  The launch of the Atlas 3A, an upgraded version
of the Atlas 2 using Russian-designed RD-180 main engines and a
Centaur upper stage, has been delayed while an investigation
continued into the failure of an RL-10 engine on a Delta 3 launch in
May similar to the engine used by the Centaur. 

Titan's Hydrocarbon Oceans:  New images from the Keck Observatory
released July 28 have provided the best view yet of Titan's surface
and show evidence of possible oceans of ethane, methane, or other
hydrocarbons.  The images, taken at infrared wavelengths that can
peer through the moon's thick smog, show evidence of bright and dark
regions on the surface that scientists interpret as areas of land and
ocean, respectively.  The images are not the first view of the
surface of the moon: The Hubble Space Telescope provided similar
views at near-infrared wavelengths in 1994. However, the Keck images
are sharper, thanks to a process known as "speckle interferometry"
that combines a large number of short snapshots are processed
together to remove the blurring effects of Earth's turbulent
atmosphere.

Keeping Track of Near-Earth Asteroids:  Despite several new search
efforts and a decrease in the estimated overall population, most of
the near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) that pose the greatest threat to the
Earth have yet to be discovered, astronomers reported at a conference
Tuesday, July 27.  While new observations have led some astronomers
to believe that there are only 500-1000 NEAs 1 km (0.6-mi.) or larger
in diameter, only 15-20% of these NEAs have been discovered.   At
current discovery rates the rest will be found in 20 to 40 years,
although quadrupling the discovery rate should allow 90% of these
NEAs to be discovered in the next 10 years, the goal of the proposed
Spaceguard program.

Interesting NEAs:  Some NEAs that have already been discovered have
proven to be interesting objects.  Images and other data collected by
the Near-Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft's flyby of Eros
show the asteroid is likely a solid body, and not a rubble pile like
other asteroids.  Two papers published in the July 23 issue of
Science show that Eros more closely resembles the main-belt asteroid
Ida rather than Mathilde, a rubble-pile asteroid NEAR flew by in
1997.  A much smaller NEA, 1998 KY26, is also likely a solid body, in
part because its 10-minute rotation period makes it the most
rapidly-rotating solar system body yet discovered.  A compositional
analysis of the asteroid, based on telescopic observations in June,
show that the asteroid is a carbonaceous chondrite, rich with water.
"This asteroid is quite literally an oasis for future space
explorers," said JPL's Steve Ostro.

Indemnification, Russia Legislation:  The House Science Committee's
space subcommittee passed bills Thursday, July 29 that would extend
commercial launch indemnification and would tie any NASA funding of
Russia's space program to missile nonproliferation efforts.  HR 2607,
the Commercial Space Transportation Competitiveness Act of 1999,
would extend for five years the indemnification on catastrophic
launch accidents that is currently set to expire at the end of 1999.
HR 1883, Iran Non-Proliferation Act of 1999., would prevent NASA from
sending any money to the Russian Space Agency in the event that the
administration determined that Russia was helping Iran develop
long-range ballistic missiles.  The subcommittee passed two
amendments that would allow funding for safety reasons, or to
complete and build the space station's service module, even if a ban
was in effect.

                 Getting Oriented in Weightlessness:
                Results of a Space Shuttle Experiment
                        by Dr. Charles M. Oman

	"What's up?" is not a trivial question for astronauts in
weightlessness.  Gravitational "down" cues are missing, so they must
depend on vision to maintain their spatial orientation.  Many
astronauts seem to maintain a local "subjective" vertical frame of
reference, which accounts for their occasional reports of  inversion
illusions, visual reorientation illusions, and fear of falling during
space walks, all of which can sometimes trigger space motion
sickness.  Previous Spacelab studies using rolling dotted cylinder
displays showed increased susceptibility to roll circular vection (a
visually induced motion illusion) during the first week in space.
However, information on linear vection susceptibility, and perceptual
responses to structured visual scenes remained important pieces of
the scientific puzzle which were missing prior to Neurolab.  

	The availability of the Neurolab Virtual Environment
Generator on the STS-90 shuttle mission in April 1998 allowed us to
employ a wider repertoire of stimuli, including not only dotted
cylinders, but also moving corridors, and tilted or rolling
spacecraft interiors.  This was the first use of virtual reality
techniques in space.  We studied both circular and linear vection,
visual reorientation illusions, and subjective reference frame
effects on figure recognition and shading interpretation.

	We found that susceptibility to both linear as well as
circular vection illusion was increased in weightlessness for three
test subjects.  Both vection measures were consistently reduced in
flight when the subject wore a harness which held them "down" to the
deck.  We also tested the effects of stationary spacecraft interior
scenes tilted at various angles on the perceived vertical -- a 0-G
extension of classic tilted room experiments. Responses of three
subjects did not change in orbit.  All of them were either strongly
dependent or strongly independent on visual scene tilt in preflight
tests.  However, one moderately visually independent subject -- as
evidenced by sensitivity to scene content and body orientation --
shifted to strong visual dependence in flight, and gradually returned
to independence during the first week post flight. No subjects became
more visually independent during or after flight.

	Our tumbling room tests confirmed a consistent increase in
circular vection in orbit.  Visual reorientation illusion frequency
in supine testing preflight and in flight were similar for most
subjects.  The distribution of scene angles at VRI onset showed
statistically significant modal tendencies, but were unchanged in 2
of 3 subjects. We had hypothesized that complex figure recognition
and interpretation of shape from shading would show effects when the
direction of the subjective vertical was manipulated, as it does on
Earth, even though gravity is absent. Most subjects had response
biases or performed the task inconsistently, which may have masked
the effect.  However, one subject was able to demonstrate both types
of effects consistently, showing that choice of subjective reference
frame can have important perceptual consequences for astronauts.

	Our experiment has been tentatively selected for reflight on
the International Space Station, to see how our measures of astronaut
spatial orientation change over months, rather than days in.  Our
Neurolab scientific results, virtual reality methods, and analysis
techniques are proving useful in the current research of the National
Space Biomedical Research Institute, aimed at developing preflight
spatial orientation training as a countermeasure, and understanding
how sense of direction is coded in 3 dimensions in the hippocampus.
Our findings also broaden our understanding of how elderly people and
patients with diseases of the inner ear or hippocampus use visual
cues, and why some find certain situations in daily life disorienting
-- for example walking or driving at night, in subway stations or
supermarket corridors, or in wide screen movie theaters.

The following quote was taken from the article, >>"Richter Scale" of
Asteroid Impact Threats Announced<<  released on Spaceviews, here:
http://www.spaceviews.com/1999/08/

"Some asteroids, such as 1999 AN10, at one time measured a 1 on the
[Torino] scale, meaning that they had about an equal probability of
striking Earth as a random, undiscovered object of similar size."

Now, I've got to wonder: if an object is "undiscovered," how we can know
anything about its size, or its probability of striking Earth? I feel
it's important to clarify this, because it would seem to suggest that
our asteroid experts are postulating  the likelihoods of specific
events, with NO real-world information to base their judgments on. This
can't be true, can it?

If any of you folks know anything about how these people do their work,
I'd enjoy a little bit of enlightenment about it, as I'm sure a lot of
us would.

Keep looking up,

Curtis

You can obtain the approximate historical probability of the
Earth being struck by asteroids based on geological evidence of
previous impacts.  So it may not be as silly as it sounds to talk
about the probability of the Earth being struck by undiscovered
objects, although it would be nice to know more about how they
came up with the numbers.

I would assume you count all the impacts made and date them.
Add in a fudge factor for the ones you missed and try to sort them 
by impact size and age. Since the last big impact was 65 million years ago
I think mankind has a very small chance of death by impact as opposed to other
things. This does not count mankinds stupidly like mining asteroids and trying
to 
place on in orbit.
Ben.

Hello,I have been a member of this mailing list for
sometime now and find the some of the views expressed
very interesting. I am hoping someone can help me with
the following...

 I am a student is of architecture in India who is
currently doing a dissertation on the future of
architecture in outer space. My main source of
information is the Internet since there isn't much
information on the design aspect of the topic here
(requirements, constraints etc. other than the
obvious). If anyone can help me out with my problem,
it would help me immensely. I have visited the NASA
site and got some information from there. It would
also help if anyone could refer me to someone I can
contact via e-mail.
Thanx for your time and help.

Sharmila Badkar

Since this list is so quiet, I thought I might as well bring it up. I
have this idea for a balloon type arrangement for space propulsion.
There's a shoddily drawn model below. The plates (red stuff) are coated
in a kind of phosphor. I was hoping they could alter Microwave light,
but if not that's okay, the holes can be scaled down. So the out side
layer is made of a mesh that is just loose enough to let the first
(green) kind of microwave in, but not the second blue one. If the
phosphor will only lower the frequency, we can have a coating to exploit
microwaves' penetrating properties. As far as I can tell, this would
cause all the microwaves going at the balloon to come out the back end,
driving it forward. Does this all work, or can you find an error in my
thinking? I know that it's not a very realistic idea, since the balloon
would have to be so big compared to the cargo. Also, what about
interstellar debris piercing the balloon?
