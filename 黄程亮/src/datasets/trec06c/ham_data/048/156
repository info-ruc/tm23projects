  1.1.10 contains a few changes but of most relevance is enhanced
compatabilty checking for the DigitalVOX device.  It appears that some
older sound cards when used for a DigitalVOX will pass all of the
DirectSoundCapture creation routines but simply provide no data, the VOX
tests in TimeDX and DMDX now check for this and provide a warning if the
card is found to do so.  I haven't got a card that does this but I am
assured by a developer in Europe that he had to test for no data being
generated -- the only card I have that fails is an old Ensoniq thing and it
just fails the DirectSoundCapture creation.
