I have used this method, to great effect. It seemed upon first try that
it was just too darn big to do any good, but if you're creative it's
really pretty efficient.

I *would* share my code, but it all burned up in a fire (he-he).
Actually, I was going to build a page with links to text files for all
my code that I do for everything. When I thought of this I was doing a
school project in Houston, with my Slackware running laptop. I got home
and sold the box to my wife, who only uses windows. After I DOS
formatted the harddrive, I realized that everything was still on the
darn thing. Man, was I pissed! From now on I'm posting *ALL* of my code
to a page, if only to protect it from myself!

No links, except to tell you to look at the many sources for regular C
programs. I was surprised to find that many of the functions that I used
for my IC based bot (timers, I/O stuff, yada) could be ported from other
code. The only benefit to this is it gave me the chance to really read
code, and understand a lot more. Honestly it's usually easier and faster
just to write it, but reading gave me a way to learn more!

I'd be willing to host a free IC code site if people are interested.
