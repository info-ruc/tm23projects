I had to go RTFM for this one ;-)

It says:
	5.6 Arrays and Pointers
	IC supports one-dimensional arrays of characters,
	integers, long integers, and floating-point numbers.
	Pointers to data items and arrays are supported.

It doesn't say that pointers to pointers or arrays of pointers or 2-D arrays are allowed, so I'm guessing that they're not.  Also, I see no mention of structs being supported, either.

IC is a little different from regular C, but it's still a powerful, expressive language.  I'm sure there's probably a way to do what you want in IC, but with such a small code snippet, I can only guess.  But hey, at least we're not stuck with only machine language programming <8-o

Good luck!
