I had a similar problem.  In my case, the cause was underneath the board.  I
had not trimmed one of the components leads enough.  When I screwing the board
into the case the lead eventually pierced one of the wires going to my Nicad
pac.  My board would boot up with black squares, or when things got bumpy my
bot would go horribly wrong.........

just a thought
