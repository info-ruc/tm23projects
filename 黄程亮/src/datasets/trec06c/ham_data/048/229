I haven't looked at the schematics for the handyboard for a while, but if
you use an E-series processor, then I think you can go up to 12MHz (3 MHz
E-Clock).

I'm not sure whether the rest of the Handyboard could take the increased
speed, and of course you would either have to get away from using IC
which would up the complexity of the programming task.  I'm using an
E9 in one of my boards, but I haven't messed with the clock.
