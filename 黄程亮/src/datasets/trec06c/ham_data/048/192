The definitive answer comes from the "pink" book, which everyone should
have (especially now that you can get it on CD-rom for free by filling out
the form on the Mot web site!) Which basically says "No you can't do that."
But it says it in a somewhat confusing way.

The baud rate of the SCI is controlled by 5 bits in the "BAUD" register
(address $102B). Bits 4 and 5 set the prescaler, and then 0 thru 2 set the
baud rate. With an 8Mhz clock you can set the prescaler to produce as a top
baud rate either 125K, 41.67K, 31.25K, or 9600. Then with the lower three
bits you can divide that top rate by 1 through 8 (so anything smaller in
increments of 1/2 up to 8 times) [For you music fans the Handboard can be
programmed for 31.5K with is the MIDI standard rate]

To get 19.2 you need run the board at 10Mhz which you can't do with the
handyboard.
