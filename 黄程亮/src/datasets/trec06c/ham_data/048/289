Dear all,

I'm constructing an exeriment in which I want to present the subject with a
begining of a sentence, and then when he's ready he should press the space
bar to get the last item, for which he should decide whether it's a word or
not. I found no problems in terms of presentation, however, I don't know how
to let the program know to wait until the space bar is pressed, before
presenting the last item. I guess I should add a keyword before the first
part (i.e., the sentence), but could not find the right way to do it. Does
anybody know if it is possibile to generate, and if it does, what is the
right way to do it?  If needed, I can add more details about the paradigm. 


Thanks a lot,
