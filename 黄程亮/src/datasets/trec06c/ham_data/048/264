There is a whole community of Radio Control submariners who have extensive
experience that you could make use of.   If you want it to act like a true
submarine with diving planes etc. you should definitely use their knowledge
base.  It is much harder than it would appear.  A few links:

I once built a  small submersible using a veterinarians syringe as the
balast tank.  A gearmotor drove a long threaded shaft to move the piston in
and out.  The tip of the syringe was connected to the outside of the sub and
the other end was open to the inside of the sub.  When the piston moved into
the syringe it pushed water out and decreased the air pressure inside the
sub slightly.  When the piston came back in it would suck in water and make
the sub heavier.  Something like this could be done with almost any smooth
tube and a corresponding piston with an O ring seal.  The trick is that if
you go very deep you may exceed the motors capacity to push.  The nice thing
about it is its simplicity and no requirement for compressed air.

I'm curious; what is the difference between the "buoyancy tank" and the
"resevoir"?  I'd think moving air from one tank to another won't 
actually
affect buoyancy.  Am I missing something?

That's interesting; but difficult, right?  Ensuring a watertight seal 
around
the piston even under various pressure differences is really hard.  Can 
you refer a specific piston system?

That's a good idea.
