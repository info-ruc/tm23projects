  So that would indicate that there is trouble with your DirectSoundCapture
device.  I take it that you can record successfully using the plain windows
routines that non-DirectX programs use?  Unfortunately the diag/info
programs (under Program Files / DirectX / Setup there is a program called
something Like DxInfo under DX5, it's DXDiag in DX6) that I see make no
reference to DirectSoundCapture devices so I don't see any way to get
diagnostics there.  Perhaps you could try installing DX6.1 (dx61eng.exe)
and see if that rectifies things.  There's not really a lot more I can do,
all the code that interfaces with DirectSoundCapture checks error codes
religiously and works on three different machines of mine with two
different sounds cards (and SB16 PnP and a TBS Montego), one quiet old and
one quiet new one.  Perhaps you have run into the problem of a sound card
not being able to do full duplex, that is the ability record and playback
at the same time, a necessity for DMDX -- you might want to check the
resources allocated to the sound card in the machine's Device Manager and
see if things look ok.  I was going to suggest that the sound device should
have two DMA channels but I notice that the Turtle Beach Montego I have
only has a single interrupt and no DMA channels at all for it's PCI audio
device, the sound blaster emulation has one interrupt and two DMA channels,
however I really doubt that DMDX would be using the sound blaster
emulation.  Perhaps your sound cards just can't do full duplex audio.
