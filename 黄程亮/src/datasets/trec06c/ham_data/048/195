You can communicate at higher baud rates (19200 or 38400) on an 8MHz 68HC11
if you disable SCI and use software "bit-bashing" routines.

I have enclosed examples of such routines in sw_baud.s11 file. Setting the
BIT_TIME to 52 or 104 allows you to communicate either at 38400 or 19200.
Code has been written for GNU as6811 so
certain adjustments may be required to compile with IC tools.
