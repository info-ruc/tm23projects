Here is the relevant function.  Note that it only works for baud rates up to 
9600.

void set_baud(int rate)              /* For an 8 MHz clock */
{
	if (rate >= 300)
		poke(BAUD, 0xb0 | log2(9600/rate));
}

You'll need regdefines.c (for the address of BAUD) as well as the following 
function:

int log2(int x)     /*  2**logx <= x < 2**(logx+1)  */
{
	int logx;

	if (x) {
		logx = 15;
		while (!(0x8000 & x)) {
			x <<= 1;
			logx--;
		}
		return logx;
	}
	else
		return -1;
}

I personally like the generality of invoking log2(), but you can of course 
use a series of if statements instead.

There is also a location in the pcode interpreter that you can POKE to 
change the baud rate used by IC.  But until IC can adjust its rate, this 
operation will break the connection.
