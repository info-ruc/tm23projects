    I have try to run the handy board using the standard DC 9V  motor
purchase from one of the vendors. However , it does not seem be able to
move very well though i put it to 100% of its capacity. I am now working
on a project to built a remote car which must be able to carry a load of
1.5kg. Does anyone has any  motor model to recommend?

    Secondly, can i connect a 12V supply directly to terminal meant for
the 9V battery directly. Since the HB can take in supply of 9 - 12 V.
