Subject: Can't bootstrap! & IR reflective sensors help
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

After assembling my own handyboard (ugh), and everything was
(supposedly) solded OK, i tried to put the handyboard in bootstrap mode.
But i get no results... i tested the stop button and it works fine (i
compared with the OTHER handyboard i had)... i also had to solder the
resistor pack manually with cables (the tracks broke) - can anyone tell
me what might be wrong?

About the IR sensors, i wanted to know what circuit (i.e. w/
transistors) would be fine to use to amplify the signals, because i only
get millivolt variations on my sensor. Any ideas? Thanks!
