I just got the stepper rountine working in my board this weekend.


There were some problems initially. I had to replace the cycle_length with
the actual number (4).

There were also some errors with variable type conversions, for example FAST
and SLOW are long, so you need to assign variables as FAST =8L.

In addition, msleep() needs a long but delay is an int, so you need to call
it with a conversion, msleep((long)delay).

If you like, I can e-mail you the actual code I used.
