Hi,
You can use the SPI interface and have the BS2 as a master. The BS2 then
defines the clockspeed, because
the slowest speed you can select on the 6811 is probably to high for the
BS2.
It is very simple to use this interface. See the "pink book" of the 68HC11.
I used the SPI interface to "talk" to a PIC 16F84, which does sonar distance
measurement.

Hello to everybody.

    I would like to ask if is possible to interface the handyboard with the
basic stamp2 using not the RS232.

Thanks beforehand.
