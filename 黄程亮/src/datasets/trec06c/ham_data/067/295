I'd like to know how many servos the handy board can control. On the FAQ it
says 2, in the documentation it says 4 DC motors. what's the deal? (am I
stupid? I'm new at this)

also, when you plug an expansion board, do you get 6 EXTRA servos? or those
are the only ones you can still use? How about the rest? do all imputs
remain free on the handyboard and everything on the expansion board is
extra? than you.
