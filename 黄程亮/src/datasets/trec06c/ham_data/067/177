Hi Folks,
Had a bad experience with my handyboard thos past week,
I left it on charge accidently for two days-could possibly even been in =
the zap mode I'm not sure.
What did happen was  the battery was dead ,r-11 was hot and turned black =
and the diode bridge was hot.
The charge  led does not lightwhen power is applied in normal mode or =
zap mode.
The mole ac adapter regesters 19 volts while unpluged,positive being the =
outside of the plug.
 I have installed a new 9.5v- 1000mAh radio shack #23-329A battery and =
the 47ohm r-11.
R-11 will still get hot when power is applied and the handyboard is =
connected.
I have the correct telephone type rj11 connecting cord, same as I have =
been using. Colors match when held facing each other as per directions.
What is the best way to solve this problem??

Thanks in advance,
Terry Gathright
