I quite agree. The PC clones may be cheap and fast, but they are
anything but elegant.

I figure that those people with enough good taste to use Plan9 in
preference to the far more prevalent Microsoft/Apple alternatives
are the same people that are likely to have good taste in hardware
as well.

I could live with a distribution that perhaps only came with Intel
binaries, but at least had the sources and cross compilers to allow
building of systems for other architectures. I have two Sparc2's
which are not fast, but they are nicer to work on and have lasted
much better than Intel machines of similar vintage.

One thing I would like to see added to the Plan9 distribution,
as far as cross platform compatibility is concerned, is PowerPC
support.
