I see.  Humm.  May be I can really use this.  OK, if I put a few IR LED with
ID at different locations in the room, and put them at the same height as
the robot sensor so I don't need to worry about tilt angle.  If I put the
sensor fixed on the robot, then I should be able to give the robot some
sense of direction.  Now, all I need to do is to program the LED with an ID
code...  Do you have a good scheme so that I can create quite a few number
of ID codes?
