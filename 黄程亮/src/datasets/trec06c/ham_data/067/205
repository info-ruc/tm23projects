    How about a beacon system.  Each room can have 3 or so beacons high on 
the wall.  Each beacon flashes at 38Khz and each beacon modulates this 38KHz 
with its own personal code.  The top layer of your robot would have 3 or 4 
directional sensors with precision angular encoders mounted on them.  Then 
take the angles measured from each sensor and the code number for that 
sensor.  Use the code number to look up the beacon location from ROM.  Use 
the angles measured and the known position of the beacons to deduce the 
robots location.
    If you are reluctant to go attaching LEDs to the walls of your house, you 
could build a box containing several IR Lasers.  Modulate the lasers the same 
as you would for LED beacons.  Shine the lasers at various points on the 
walls (where the beacons should be) and the scattered laser spot will be your 
beacon source.

Just a thought,
