A sad attempt at a con job. They claim they want yo give you custody of
  $35M (of whoich you're supposed to keep 30%), and all you have to do
  is send them your bank account number.

Somehow I rather doubt a legitimate offer of this sort (if this kind on
  international money laundering could be termed "legitimate") wouldn't
  be made via email. Especially not in full detail in the fiorst email
  to a stranger. 

I'd find it rather laughable, except that there are poeple out there who
  will get this and actually think it's for real, give the con-man 
  their bank account info, and get cleaned out. Then again, anyone who
  would really believe this piece of garbage probably deserves to get
  cleaned out. Something about a fool and his money...
