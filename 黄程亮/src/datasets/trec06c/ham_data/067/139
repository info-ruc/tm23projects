Dear DMDX,

Thank you all. Particularly for getting back to me so quickly. Buffering 
(or lack of) certainly seems to be the issue for the errors that are 
occurring with the masking *.rtf.

As for the VPM/DMDX problem, the card I have in one PC is an NVidia 
Video-78 128 ZX (8Mb). This card is fine for DMDX, but in VPM it starts 
having DOS mode troubles which can not be corrected by changing the mode. I 
contacted the manufacturers (Jaton Corp.), who suggested I contact NVidia 
to get DOS utilities for the card. NVidia did not respond to my request.
A new computer that has just arrived in the lab with an S3 Inc. Trio 3D/2X 
video card. This supports both DMDX and VPM rather well. I'll probably 
install this card in the computers that are currently having VPM issues.

Thanks again.

Julian.
