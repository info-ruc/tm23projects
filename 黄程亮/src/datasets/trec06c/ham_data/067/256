Subject: Running as11

Hi,

Has anyone been able to run as11 on a Mac?  As a first test of the 
assembler, I've been trying to re-assemble pcode.asm, without success.  
Specifically, as11 balks at the preprocessor directives.  I tried running 
pcode.asm through the CodeWarrior preprocessor, but CodeWarrior doesn't like 
the use of '$' to indicate hex and '*' to flag comments.

I tried running the DOS version of as11 under the SoftPC emulator, but it 
crashes the emulator, presumably because my version of SoftPC only emulates 
a 286.

P.S. Does anyone (Randy?) have the source for the version of the pcode that 
runs under IC 3.1?
