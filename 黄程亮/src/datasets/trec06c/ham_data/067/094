   I have released version 1.2.04 that contains a new branching keyword 
based on the pseudo random number generator, <BranchIfRandomNumberLT> (or 
<birnlt> for those who don't like lots of typing).

Branch If Random Number LT Keyword

<BranchIfRandomNumberLT N1,N2>
<birnlt N1,N2>

         Generates a pseudo random number between 0 and 999 (inclusive) and 
tests this against N1, if it is less than N1 a branch to item N2 is 
performed (see <Branch>).  The pseudo random number sequence is the same as 
is used for scrambling and so is affected by the scramble I parameter if 
used, otherwise the sequence is initialized by the current time.


   I sure hope Eudora strips the formatting out of that text.
