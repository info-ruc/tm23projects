Plan9 terminal (standalone from CD).

I am trying to put in the updates into the source. I have problem
compiling (via mk all) /sys/src/fb/tiff2pic.c

8c tiff2pc.c
/sys/include/libtiff.h:263 tiff2pic.c:6 syantax error last name: ap
..

Looks I need an updated /sys/include/libtiff.h? Where can I find a
copy?
