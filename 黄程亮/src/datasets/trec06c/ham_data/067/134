         I don't know what VPM is, but it seems unlikely that it would 
require a special graphics card.  Jonathan's DMDX Updates page is the place 
to look for info about hardware that has problems with DMDX.  My guess is 
that your timing errors are due to other factors, such as trying to briefly 
display a .bmp file that is too large.

         Using a frame timer of %4 would give you 40 ms only if the refresh 
interval is 10 ms.  You need to use TimeDX to find out what your refresh 
interval is.  Note that this changes with different screen 
resolutions.  Note also that you need to store these values in the 
Registry, using TimeDX | Advanced | Vertical Retrace Sync Thread.
