Dear Julian,

I can't answer your first question, but I can answer the second. If you set 
the timing to 4%, DMDX will present each frame for 4 screen refreshes. Your 
screen refresh is unlikely to be 10ms, so a 4% stimulus probably won't 
appear for 40ms. You need to check the refresh rate using TimeDX to 
determine how long the screen refresh takes. Bear in mind that the refresh 
rate might vary when (if) you change the screen resolution. That is, you 
might have different refresh rates for 640x480 pixels and 1152x864 pixels. 
As for how much the display times will vary between trials, one of the 
great things about DMDX, is that the presentation times are almost always 
millisecond accurate. If anything happens to the system that might 
compromise this accuracy, you will get a message in your output .azk file 
(if you use ascii output anyway).

I hope this helps.

Michael Johnston
