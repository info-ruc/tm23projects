That makes me happy too. The installation has always assumed the
availability of an Intel PC to bootstrap the process, so getting
it to build the binaries as well is not too much of a hardship.
Especially as any cautious person would re-build the system from
sources after installation anyway - especially before trying to
modify anything.

And if the removal of the binaries means the addition of new
functionality to the CD, I am all for it.

Does any know what, if any, concessions purchasers of the original
distribution will get with regard to a new release? That is, is
there an upgrade price, or do we just buy again?

(I didn't catch the origin of this thread, so I appologise if this
has been asked before)
