support for the powerpc has been here and there in some form for
four or five years (i ported the compiler suite years ago, and did some more
work on it for Plan 9 and Inferno work over the years).  if it's not in the plan 9 release,
i'll provide it.   if it is in the release, i'll synchronise sources.
the problem up to now has been that it's not straightforward
to release the compiler modifications generally under the old licence.
if you could stomach it, you have been able to get a load of
boddles for some time from http://www.caldo.demon.co.uk/plan9/soft/power.html.
i've made some code improvements to it since then (1998) as part of Inferno work.
at some stage i'll synchronise sources.   it included Alef, so i was using Acme on a powerpc.

i haven't used the 603/603e Plan 9 kernel for well over a year (just lack of time);
in multiprocessor mode, i had it going only as a cpu server because of (old) pc driver restrictions and a few other
cache-coherency problems.
