Sorry for such a basic question, but I can't figure out how to scramble the
presentation of blocks of items as well as the items within each block.  I'm
doing a categorization task where the first item of a block tells the
subject which category they're working with for the next 8 items.  For
example:

\
$
0 "The current category is:",
<line 1> "BIRD",
<line 3> "Please indicate for each of the following 8 items",
<line 4> "whether they belong to the category BIRD or not.";
$
+105 "###########" /   * "PENGUIN" /;
+106 "###########" /   * "SPARROW" /;
+107 "###########" /   * "OSTRICH" /;
+108 "###########" /   * "QUAIL" /;
-0305 "###########" /   * "ANT" /;
-1306 "###########" /   * "FOOT" /;
-0207 "###########" /   * "SPIDER" /;
-1208 "###########" /   * "NOSE" /;

It's very important that the items I have under "BIRD" don't get scrambled
with items from other categories (thus the "\").  But it's also important
that "BIRD" doesn't always appear in the same place.  So, how do I scramble
my categories of items as well as my items within a category?

thanks for any help and sorry to bother everyone with such a simple question

Matthew
