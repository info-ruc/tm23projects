I *think* it means that the video card will use whatever refresh rate was
previously set in the video card configuration (accessed by right clicking
on the desktop -> properties -> settings -> advanced). 

If you change the refresh rate by clicking on the desktop, those changes
seem to be preserved when you go into TimeDX and set up a video mode at the
same resolution and colour depth as the desktop. 

However, I've not had any success in setting the refresh interval to be a
certain number of Hz within the VideoMode key word in DMDX.

It seems to me that being able to specify refresh intervals in the top line
of the script would be useful and would prevent the kind of mistakes that
can arise if you run a script at an inappropriate refresh rate. However, I
don't know how to do this.

Any ideas?

Matt
