(Note to ipsec@ readers -- this is a follow-up to a discussion on the 
cryptography list a week or so ago.  To spare folks who subscribe to both, I've
directed followups to the cryptography list ONLY.  Subscription to it is via

----
Following my exchange of notes with Ron Rivest on key agility for
IPsec, I decided to gather some real data.  I used a monitoring
station on the plaintext side of one of our IPsec gateways to gather
7,000,000 packets in three sessions, two afternoon and one evening.
Note carefully that this experiment is preliminary and small-scale.

That particular gateway is a Linux box running FreeSWAN; it serves about
180 homes running Linux IPsec appliances (for details on the setup,
see http://www.quintillion.com/moat/lisa-moat.ps or .pdf).  Most
of our endpoints have high-quality (i.e., short path) connections
to the gateway.  Packet headers were captured via tcpdump; lacking
access to the ciphertext (and hence the SPI), I intuited the SA
from the remote IP address and knowledge of our address assignment
plan.  Thus, since most people are assigned /29s, I assumed that
I could mask off the low-order three bits of IP addresses in that
range and get the security association.  I split the received
traffic depending on whether the gateway was encrypting or decrypting
the packet.

Users of this gateway typically have either a non-Windows machine
or more than one machine on a home LAN.  (People with a single
Windows machine generally use a software client, and are homed on
a different gateway.)  I picked up converstations to about 145 home
networks, and about 300 different machines.  I made no attempt to
account for rekeying; that should be infrequent enough that it
wouldn't affect key agility requirements.

The network behavior was about as expected.  There were more packets
to the home than from it (4,189,877 vs. 2,810,123) and many more
bytes (1,705,033,395 vs. 297,915,963), for an average of 406
bytes/packet downstream and 106 bytes/packet upstream.  While I
haven't yet analyzed packet size distributions for upstream vs.
downstream, the different average sizes certainly suggest that a
larger percentage of the upstream packets are made up of tinygrams.

To assess the key agility requirements, I simulated an LRU cache
of infiite depth.  The number of cache hits at a given depth should
then indicate how large a cache would be needed to avoid a new key
schedule calculation.  (Note:  I think that this approach is
reasonable -- does anyone disagree?)  I could have, but didn't,
discard cache entries when too much time had elapsed since the last
use, thus indicating a likely rekeying operation.

To achieve an 80% hit rate, a cache size of 5 entries is needed
for the encrypt (to the home) side, while a 8-element cache would
be needed for decryption.  To achieve a 95% hit rate, 11 and 17
element caches would be needed.

The cache size differences agree with intuition.  The gateway
decrypt side requires a bigger cache than the encrypt side to
achieve the same hit rate; this is probably a function of the
mechanisms I suggested a few days ago:  smaller packets which allow
for more interleaving, delayed ACK strategies, and some lack of
"packet trains".  IPsec decryption is in some sense more demanding
than encryption; since MAC-checking can be done in parallel with
decryption, multiple packets can be decrypted back-to-back, without
needing to reuse the data path for serial encrypt/MAC generation.
On the other hand, the upstream data rate was considerably less,
allowing more time for key-switching.

I did some preliminary analysis of packet train lengths.  Downstream
packets show some evidence of packet clustering, though not as much
as I had expected -- 60% of the trains downstream were of length
1, compared with 70% of upstream trains.

I'm not sure what further analyses I should perform on this data.
I do caution people that these are small-scale measurements from
one site; I would be very interested to see data from other sites
with IPsec gateways, especially big gateways.  As I noted, I saw
less than 150 SAs; it is not clear to me what would happen with
1500 or 15,000 SAs.  For actual assessment of key agility requirements, a 
larger study is needed.

I've attached the output summary files.  The first column is the
LRU depth; the second is the number of hits at that depth, and the
third is the cumulative packet percentage for that depth.  (The
first line is the number of different SAs, and while it does figure
into the cumulative percentages, its effect is obviously minimal.)
