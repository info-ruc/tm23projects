Developed after many years of research into extending the preservation periods of biological materials, these cutting-edge technologies may soon be available to save potentially thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars.</p></td><td valign="middle"><br><br><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" border="0" bgcolor="8EACB2" width="300"><tr><td valign="top"><table cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2" border="0" width="300"><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6">Company:</td><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6"><strong>Human BioSystems, Inc.<br> (OTCBB: HBSC)</strong></td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#D2D9DB">Symbol:</td><td class="text" bgcolor="#D2D9DB"><a href="http://bigcharts.marketwatch.com/intchart/frames/main.asp?time=2&freq=8&compidx=aaaaa%3A0&comp=NO_SYMBOL_CHOSEN&ma=0&maval=9&uf=0&lf=1&lf2=0&lf3=0&type=8&style=360&size=2&sid=0&o_symb=hbsc&startdate=&enddate=&show=true&symb=hbsc&draw.x=53&draw.y=13" target="_blank">HBSC</a></td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6">Shares I/O:</td><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6">75.3M</td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#D2D9DB">Market Cap:</td><td class="text" bgcolor="#D2D9DB">21.46 M</td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6">10-Day Volume Average:</td><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6">250,630</td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#D2D9DB">Shares Outstanding:</td><td class="text" bgcolor="#D2D9DB">75.3 M</td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6">Float:</td><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6">31.1 M</td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#D2D9DB" colspan="2" align="center"><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/520.html"><img src="http://pws.prserv.net/venturepoint/chart2.gif" width="302" height="175" border="0"></a></td></tr><tr><td class="text" bgcolor="#A5B3B6" colspan="2" align="center">Website: <a href="http://pws.prserv.net/venturepoint/Automatic102.htm">humanbiosystems.com</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><ul><li class="head style1">BLOOD PLATELET PRESERVATION</li></ul><p>Why is this technology important? Cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy treatment cause damage to the platelet structure of the blood and its ability to produce platelets for a period of time. The result is a longer period of recovery from this treatment. HBS's proprietary technology should have the ability to provide longer shelf life for platelets allowing doctors to have available a larger, and healthier platelet inventory to help these patients to recover.</p><p>Blood platelets are cellular blood components essential to the clotting process and critical in the treatment of cancer, organ transplantation and burns. Because platelets are highly susceptible to bacterial contamination and rapid loss of effectiveness, they currently have a United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated five-day shelf life. As a result, an estimated $700 million in blood platelets must be discarded without being used every year in the United States, Europe and Japan. This represents a significant financial loss to blood centers and hospitals.</p><div><strong>Longer preservation times will allow blood centers and hospitals to recover up to 90% or more of lost revenues.</strong></div><p>The company's goal is to prolong the shelf life of blood platelets from the FDA's five-day standard period to 10-14 days or longer. This would be a significant medical breakthrough that should increase the global availability of precious living biological materials needed to save human lives and hundreds of millions of dollars a year in medical costs.</p><ul><li class="head style1">ORGAN PRESERVATION</li></ul> <strong>Why is this technology important?</strong><p>In the U.S. alone, more than 73,000-patients were on transplant waiting lists in 2001. Currently donor organs can only be preserved for extremely brief periods ranging from four to 36 hours, depending on the organ.</p><p>The company believes its technology could extend the shelf life of organs from a few hours to days while maintaining the viability; quality and safety of organs vital to patients on transplant waiting lists.</p><p>Patients receiving donor organs preserved by the company's preservation technology may benefit from decreased requirements for anti-rejection drugs. Current donor organ decisions must be made rapidly due to short shelf life, recipients often receive organs that are not an ideal match.</p><p>By extending organ preservation time, transplant recipients can expect optimized transplant success since more time is available for organs to be more suitably matched and thereby lessening the immune response. It is not uncommon for transplant patients to pay up to $20,000 a year in anti-rejection drugs for the rest of their lives. This can represent billions of dollars in costs to insurance companies and governments that fund medical costs.</p><span class="head style1">RECENT SUCCESSES</span><br><br> <strong>Over the past two years</strong> <ul><li>U.S. Patent Office has notified Human BioSystems (HBS) that it will issue a patent for organ preservation entitled "METHODS AND SOLUTIONS FOR STORING DONOR ORGANS"</li> <li>HBS now has two patents covering blood platelet preservation and biological material.</li> <li>HBS has been Awarded Patent for Blood Preservation</li> <li>HBS Announced Positive Test Results for Organ Preservation</li> <li>HBS Appointed New President - Dr. David Winter, M.D.</li> <li>HBS Announced Initial Survival Test Results - Much Better than European Gold Standard, HTK and UW</li> </ul><span class="head style1">INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS</span><br><br> <ul><li class="head style1">THE OUTLOOK</li></ul><p>Working with two independent blood centers, the company simplified and improved its platelet storage technology and is now commencing human infusion studies.</p><p>Human BioSystems plans to license both its platelet and organ preservation technology to one or more strategic alliance partners that have the capability to manufacture and distribute the company's proprietary solution to blood centers worldwide. Initial revenue from licensing is expected this year.</p><p>The company estimates a multi-billion dollar market demand for its platelet and organ preservation system coupled with the post-transplant technology, once fully developed and commercialized. HBS is looking for additional products that are close to commercialization to add to its pipeline.</p><ul><li class="head style1">THE TECHNOLOGY</li></ul><p>Human BioSystems' proprietary preservation systems for initial products consist of non-toxic liquid solutions, proprietary protocols and solutions.</p>The platelet system is designed to utilize and complement standard platelet collection and processing activities. Collected platelets are processed using Human BioSystems' proprietary preservation solution and intended to be packaged in FDA approved plastic storage bags.<p>Instead of being stored in a rocking device at room temperature, as is current industry practice, the storage bags are cooled according to HBS protocol. The platelets are cooled to four degrees C and placed into standard blood refrigeration units for storage.</p>The Company intends to show through human infusion studies that this process exhibits improvements in viability and longevity of the blood platelets when compared to standard platelets stored at room temperature. The Company also intends to demonstrate that HBS stored platelets exhibit minimal bacteria growth during the storage period when compared to current standards of platelet storage.<p>The company's organ storage solution at refrigerated temperatures appears to be better than currently used solutions and is uniquely adaptable to use in sub-zero storage up to minus 80 degrees centigrade and lower. If further tests confirm the subzero results and FDA approval is granted, this could optimize donor/recipient matching and provide long-term storage of organs versus hours of storage under current methods available. The company has applied for patents covering the technologies and the processes outlined above. The company believes its technologies are readily applicable for preserving blood platelets and donor organs.</p><span class="head style1">MANAGEMENT</span><br><br> <ul><li><strong>Harry Masuda, - CEO</strong> - Former president of high tech company Piiceon, Inc. and founder of HK Microwave.
