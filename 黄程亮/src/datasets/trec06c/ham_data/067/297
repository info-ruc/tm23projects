I am a new Handyboard user and would like to control a pair of 5 wire unipolar
stepper motors. I followed the links in the FAQ related to steppers which
included some IC code. My problem is that my Handyboard won't load that
particular code written by Peter Harrison. If anyone could point me in the
right direction I would be most thankful.
