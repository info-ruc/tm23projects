The deal is this: Servos are different from plain old DC motors.  They ha=
ve gearing and position control circuitry built in.

There are four DC motor ports on the basic HB, but no ready-made servo po=
rts.  The dual servo routine described on the HB web site makes use of Po=
rt A bit 7 (aka digital port 9) and Port A bit 5 (on the expansion bus (b=
ack edge of board, under the LCD)).

I think you could in fact get six *extra* servos.  The expansion board do=
esn't affect the use of Port A bit 7 (aka digital port 9), and I saw inst=
ructions on the HB web site (Software Contributed section) on how to use =
the piezo beeper to control a servo, too.  The expansion board does occup=
y the expansion bus, though, precluding the use of Port A bit 5.  Still, =
I think you could run eight servos with the exp. board.  Should probably =
use a separate battery pack.

If you want to run a lot of servos, try using a serial servo controller (=
SSC).  Check out the offerings at http://www.seetron.com/.  Each SSC can =
run up to eight servos, and you can daisy chain a bunch of SSCs together =
to run up to 256 servos.  The SSCs can be plugged into Port A bit 7 (aka =
digital port 9).  Instructions are on the HB web site.  Best of luck!
