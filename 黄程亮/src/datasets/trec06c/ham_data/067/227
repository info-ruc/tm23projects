Claudia,

Without a lot more detail, it will be difficult to solve this one over the
internet.  If you can take a few minutes and regroup, maybe someone will have an
idea.

The kinds of things it would be good to know, interspersed with my comments:

1.  It is not likely that a series of expansion boards all have the same problem,
although if there is a design problem at work it's at least possible.  When you
experience the wierd analog signals, exactly which ports are they occuring on?
Some ports are pulled high with pullup resistors on the expansion board, some are
not.

2.  Do the strange signals stop and stay fixed at some value when the input signal
is unplugged from the board?  In short, is it the input sensors or the board that
is going whacky?

3.  Have you reseated all the IC's on the main board?

4.  What does the + 5 volt power line look like when these strange things are
happening?  Is is stable?  The analog signal is read by comparing the input
voltage to the power on the board (5 volts).

5.  Have you  tried another Handy Board?

6.  Is the voltage regulator on your Handy Board getting too hot?  Are any other
chips warm to the touch?

There are just a few of the things it would be nice to know.  Be as specific as
you can when you respond, in terms such as "when I watch the input signal at
analog input 17 by reading it's value from the command line in IC, I see it
float.  However, when I check the signal right at the input pin on the expansion
board with a voltmeter, it is stable at 2.5 volts."  That way we have a chance to
help you with this very strange problem.  And as likely and not, you'll find the
problem on your own by being so thorough in your investigation.  Let us know
either way.
