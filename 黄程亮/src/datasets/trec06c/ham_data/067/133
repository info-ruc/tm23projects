   Would have thought absolutely all video cards made these days provided 
good DOS support, certainly every one I have from NVIDIA does.  The timing 
errors you are running into are probably caused by there not being enough 
time to move the next frame into memory because you are using a 
prohibitively deep display mode (unless of course you are using a D 
parameter in which case stop using it).  For instance at 1024x768x16 there 
is only one extra frame buffer in 4M of video memory so DMDX must always 
have to move the next frame into video memory in the time that the previous 
frame is displayed, difficult if that frame is a prime that is displayed 
for a couple of ticks.  Using 800x600x16 frees up another back buffer so 
DMDX has two frames in which to move the data, 640x640x16 frees up even 
more.  In any event, unless your VPM program is using register level access 
for a specific chipset (in which case it's not DOS level compatibility that 
you need but a chipset compatibility and my guess is you'll never find it) 
I'd be surprised if any 16M video card that you picked up didn't solve your 
problems, they all provide VESA 1.2 (or better) support and are all 
register compatible with the standard VGA chipset, beyond that there is no 
more to DOS compatibility.
