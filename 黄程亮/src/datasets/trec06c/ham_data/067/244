Actually, I am going in that direction.  I was trying to use the ultrasonic
transducer to produce a signal and then use two detector to triangulate the
location.  That wasn't much of a success.  I will need to redo the parts.  I
want to try using more beacons and landmarks, but I couldn't come up with a
scheme to assign ID to each beacons.  Same as the IR beacons.  Any ideas?  I
am willing to program an EPROM, but I just don't have any idea as to how to
assign ID to beacons, or how the robot can distinguish the signal.  But I
guess if I figure out how to assign ID to beacons, I should know how to
program the robot to use them. :-)
