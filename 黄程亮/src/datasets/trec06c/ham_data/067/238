Some years ago i wrote the presentation part of a prototype system based on
ultrasonic beacons.
the  beacons were plugged into wall outlets and transmitted their ID:s, i
can't remember the details but the beacons were syncronized by detectecting
the zero crossing of the 220V 50Hz. i think the system gave the position
within 1 mm to 1 cm . the prototype system was 2D (x,y) but i see no problem
using it for 3D (x,y,z). Just thought i should mentioned it ...
