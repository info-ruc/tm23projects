 Greetings all,

 I'm using a homebuilt sonar based on Kam Leang's design, which seems to be
 working quite well. I just have one question with regard to the timing on
 the input port. I'm using the same sonar driver as for the polaroid - right
 now I can't remember which input is used for the return "echo".

 My question is, what is the maximum time that the timer can measure before
 returning a -1? I'm curious, as I'd like to know the maximum distance I can
 measure on the HB, so I can set my sonar unit up accordingly.

 Thanks for your help
 Adam
