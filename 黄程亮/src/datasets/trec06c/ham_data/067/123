Dear All,

I am new to DMDX, but my experience so far been most enjoyable. Many 
thanks! I believe it will become a very valuable research tool within our lab.
I have two questions that I'm hoping someone will be able to help me with:

1.	I have a slave computer which needs to run both DMDX and VPM. The 
difficulty is in finding a video card which has both the DOS utilities 
required by VPM and the windows requirements of DMDX, especially a decent 
amount of on board memory. We have an STB Nitro 3D which seems to do the 
job with 4Mb, but still seems to produce quite a few timing errors when I 
run *.bmp masking experiments. Does anyone have any suggestions?

2.	The second question relates to that most important DMDX issue, timing. 
I'm writing a backwards masking *.rtf file, and need the initial picture to 
appear for 40msec. I've been setting the presentation time at 4%. I need to 
know whether this is 40msec, and how much this may vary. I realize this 
will be influenced by the hardware, and TimeDX settings, I'm essentially 
just looking for some assurance. It's not my experiment, and thus I'd like 
to get it right (or nearly) the first time.

Any advice would be much appreciated.

Julian.
