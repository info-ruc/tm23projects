hello.

i seem to be having an expansion-board problem which is very puzzling.  i am
using all sixteen ports, and am in the process of putting together a project
which requires that it be stored with all sixteen ports occupied for a week or
two at a time - but unpowered.  after this period of storage, it has (two
times now, with two different expansion boards) begun to behave in a very
strange way.  the values are essentially all over the place, jumping from 255
to 25 to 4 to 115 etc...

has anyone encountered this - and does anyone have any idea what could be
causing the problem?  this has occurred with two expansion boards in a row.

thanks in advance,
claudia
