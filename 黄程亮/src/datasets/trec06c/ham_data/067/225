a follow-up to my own message - it seems that this problems occur WHILE i am
actually running the application and using the project.  if anyone can help at
all - i would be very grateful, i am at a loss and urgent to get this working.

i have built sixteen very simple mats which are made of vinyl, copper, and
foam - it is a simple contact which, when stepped on, drops the value downt to
nearly 1.  i had a small model of this working for months, and only after a
while using the actual size project, did this start occuring.  there is no
problem with the handyboards, but the expansion boards, one after one, seem to
be flipping out.  suddenly - the values begin skipping all over the place, or
in the latest case, 6 of them just rest at 4.

does anyone have any ideas for me?  i have tried different code and different
boards, nothing works, and i am at a loss to understand.

thanks in advance,
claudia
