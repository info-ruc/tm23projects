   Almost.  0Hz just means that the driver is going to select the refresh 
rate that's fastest given the monitor type and all other settings.

   You won't until you see TimeDX enumerate other refresh rates.

   Find a video card with a driver that enumerates multiple refresh rates 
-- good luck, I've never seen one and only ever heard anecdotal references 
to them so they might not exist at all.
