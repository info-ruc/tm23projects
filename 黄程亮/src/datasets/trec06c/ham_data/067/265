Subject: using 3v motors?

Is there any way to use 3 volt motors on the Handyboard? They draw about 400 ma.
Using a series resistor of about 10 ohms works, but it will have to be about 5
watts, consuming a lot of power needlessly. The FAQ shows how to run 6-36v
motors through a separate supply. Will this work with 3 volt motors and a 3 volt
supply??

Any ideas are welcome.

thanks,

Wayne
