Subject: Recent Java developments for high-performance computing
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.957032072.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

The recent Volume 39, number 1, 2000 issue of the IBM Systems Journal
is all about Java, and I found many interesting papers there:

        http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj39-1.html

All papers are freely available electronically.

There are several papers on very significant performance improvements
of the Java Virtual Machine and Java runtime library implementations,
and of just-in-time compilation, that are helping to bring Java
performance much closer to that attainable by code written in C, C++,
or Fortran.

One paper in particular is strongly-recommended reading for those of
you who are interested in Java for numerical computing:

@Article{Moreira:2000:JPH,

The authors describe freely-available Java class libraries that
radically improve Java performance for array operations and complex
arithmetic: in some cases, a speedup of 40x has been demonstrated.

The article begins with an excellent discussion of the weak areas of
Java for numerical computing, making it a nice complement to another
recent article in this subject area:
