What's puzzling is why they thought an Handiboard mailing list was the place
to find new pigeons...

| A sad attempt at a con job. They claim they want yo give you custody of
|   $35M (of whoich you're supposed to keep 30%), and all you have to do
|   is send them your bank account number.
|
| Somehow I rather doubt a legitimate offer of this sort (if this kind on
|   international money laundering could be termed "legitimate") wouldn't
|   be made via email. Especially not in full detail in the fiorst email
|   to a stranger.
|
| I'd find it rather laughable, except that there are poeple out there who
|   will get this and actually think it's for real, give the con-man
|   their bank account info, and get cleaned out. Then again, anyone who
|   would really believe this piece of garbage probably deserves to get
|   cleaned out. Something about a fool and his money...
