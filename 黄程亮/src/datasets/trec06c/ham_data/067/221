Hello people:

I=B4m a student from PUCRS(Brazil) and I have to finish my
conclusion
Work in my course(Mecatronical Engineering) and I need to
Know how
I modify the frequency in MC68HC11 set in 500Hz to 5KHz
because the drivers need work to control a Induction motor
with inversor and the frequency 500Hz is too low. If you
know how modify this frequency in MC68HC11 please send to me
and I feel very happy.

               thanks for your compreension
                      sincerely Guilherme Possebon
                       Porto Alegre-RGS-Brazil          =20
