Greeitngs,

After a reading a real downer (it would not get me down if it was not correct :-(
about Systems Software Research (http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/rob/utah2000.ps)
I suddenly realised that among the items in the talk was the fact that the (potential)
next release of plan9 would be x86 only. no more multi platform.

I have 3 SparcStations and one Macintosh. A x86 only release of Plan9 would be
quite expensive to me, even if it was given away for nothing...

Have I misunderstood? Perhaps this was a binary only 4 floppy distro that was mentioned,
not the real thing?


Best Wishes, Bengt
