   It's not simple, it's not doable in DMDX nor is it possible in the other 
scrambling scheme that I've been tempted to add to DMDX but haven't.  I'd 
have to come up with some nesting construct and if you've ever seen the 
scramble code (written by Ken 15 years ago, eek) you'll understand why I 
haven't added it yet.  I guess it would be possible to add a series of 
keywords that scramble's code doesn't see for the first pass that can then 
get replaced with regular $ and \ characters for the second pass through 
scramble, if I was going to do it I probably should make it N passes 
too.  That way the first scramble could be done with a G9 and no $ or \ 
characters to move your groups around preserving their internal order and 
then for the second pass the $ and \ would be in effect (and the original G 
not in effect) which would just rearrange the response items.

   Mmmm, more I think about it the easier it sounds, enter the 
<MultiScrambleX> keywords!  <mss N,N>, <msg N,N>, <msd N> and <msb 
N>.  Guess there'd have to be a <msi N,N> too.  Only real question would be 
whether backslashes stayed and the beginning of lines (if you've ever 
looked at scramble's output things like spaces and newlines move), but we 
can probably fudge that.  Your item file would become something like:

<ep> <msg 1,9> <mss 2,9>
</ep>
<msd 2>
0 "The current category is:",
<line 1> "first",
<line 3> "Please indicate for each of the following 8 items",
<line 4> "whether they belong to the category BIRD or not.";
<msd 2>
+105 "###########" / * "PENGUIN" /;
+106 "###########" / * "SPARROW" /;
+107 "###########" / * "OSTRICH" /;
+108 "###########" / * "QUAIL" /;
-0305 "###########" / * "ANT" /;
-1306 "###########" / * "FOOT" /;
-0207 "###########" / * "SPIDER" /;
-1208 "###########" / * "NOSE" /;
<msb 2>

<msd 2>
0 "The current category is:",
<line 1> "second",
<line 3> "Please indicate for each of the following 8 items",
<line 4> "whether they belong to the category BIRD or not.";
<msd 2>
+105 "###########" / * "PENGUIN" /;
+106 "###########" / * "SPARROW" /;
+107 "###########" / * "OSTRICH" /;
+108 "###########" / * "QUAIL" /;
-0305 "###########" / * "ANT" /;
-1306 "###########" / * "FOOT" /;
-0207 "###########" / * "SPIDER" /;
-1208 "###########" / * "NOSE" /;
<msb 2>

<msd 2>
0 "The current category is:",
<line 1> "third",
<line 3> "Please indicate for each of the following 8 items",
<line 4> "whether they belong to the category BIRD or not.";
<msd 2>
+105 "###########" / * "PENGUIN" /;
+106 "###########" / * "SPARROW" /;
+107 "###########" / * "OSTRICH" /;
+108 "###########" / * "QUAIL" /;
-0305 "###########" / * "ANT" /;
-1306 "###########" / * "FOOT" /;
-0207 "###########" / * "SPIDER" /;
-1208 "###########" / * "NOSE" /;
<msb 2>

   I'll see if it's easily doable and if so I might do it this evening, 
otherwise it's not likely to happen for a while, I'm building version 2 of 
TimeDX and DMDX right now...
