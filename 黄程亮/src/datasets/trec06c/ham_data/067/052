Thats great. Thanks.

It would obviously be nice if it were part of the release, and documented
in any updated release of the manuals, but I guess I am just being
lazy. So long as it is available in some form I can't complain.

Would you know off hand if the work that has been done has included
support for my little Motorola MBX board? I have gotten Linux  to
boot on it, but it is still a little fragile.
