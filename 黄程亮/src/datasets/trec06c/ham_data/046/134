Should work fine.  If you use the "Zap" charge mode, make sure the
NiCad's are designed to work on fast charging.  Some are, some aren't.

Also, make sure you buy them and dispose of them as a set.  If you
start mixing and matching NiCad's, you'll often end up shorting the
ones that are of less capacity (less capacity due to age, number of
charge/discharge cycles, etc).

Be careful about putting alkaline's in by mistake.  You might have
leakage, outgassing, or possibly a battery explosion if you try to
run the charger on them, and the voltage is higher out of an alkaline
cell than a NiCad as well.
