Product Description:

    "Microsoft IntelliEye technology employs a tiny chip with a sensor an=
d
digital signal processor (DSP). The sensor=92s glowing red light captures
=93snapshots=94 of the work surface at a rate of 1,500 images per second.=
 The
DSP translates changes between the images into on-screen pointer movement=
s.
This technique, image correlation processing, executes 18 million
instructions per second (MIPS) and results in smooth, precise pointer
movement".

So, IntelliEye may give true robot position, no stupid shaft position!
Is anybody have more info about IntelliEye hacking?

Have a Nice day.
