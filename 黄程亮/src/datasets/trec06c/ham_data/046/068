     Hey Bart,
     I read your post regarding construction of the HB.  I am putting the
     finishing touches on mine, but am having a difficult time finding the 
     DS1233-10.  Could you give me the address and phone number for FAI 
     Electronics??  Much appreciated if you could.  Thank you.
