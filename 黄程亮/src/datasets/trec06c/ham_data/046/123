Hi,

I am also having some problems with serial communications. I am trying to
send information back and forth between linux and the handyboard. I wrote
a simple serial sender for linux and have been trying to send to the
handyboard. I have two big problems, 1) the handyboard drops characters,
but not consistently. and 2) listening for serial communictations slows
the board a lot. I have not had any luck setting the baud rate on linux
and i suspect that might be the source of the dropped characters.

Thanks,
Andrea
