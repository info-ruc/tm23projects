Hello all,

Just to let you know, I have updated my HB_Buffalo development 
system.

It can be obtained at the following web address:

http://132.234.46.5/Programs/HBoard/Index.shtml

What is it:
HB_Buffalo is a monitor operating system that facilitates the 
development of machine code programs on the HandyBoard.  The 
function is similar to the Buffallo monitor provided on the 
Motorola EVB 68HC11 microprocessor boards.


What new:
- More function in the HandyBoard monitor.
- A lot of re-work in the monitor code, such that code can be more 
  easily enhanced.
- More extensive (an hopefully correct) documentation
- Assembly Help file
