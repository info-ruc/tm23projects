Hi,
I'm a french student and I buy one handy board at robot store (HongKong) only 
by mail. I paied it about 179 Euros for the assembled version with the 
Interactive C version 3.1. I think that for the first handy board it better 
to buy it assembled like you can understand how it works before to build one 
another.
The address of this shop is : http://home.hkstar.com/~huip/
Good luck and bye bye...
