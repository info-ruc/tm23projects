  Has anyone seen a DDS2:Blt() report success but actually fail?  That is,
not perform the blit?  I have an exceedingly rare instance on a multimon
machine (using the secondary display adapter that isn't part of the
desktop) with a couple of 4M S3 cards in it where this appears to occur and
it scares me -- so in order to vanquish the boogey man I'd like someone to
reassure me that this is a technical impossibility and that no one has ever
seen such behaviour.  I'm used to breaking video drivers, what with
flipping chains with 12 backbuffers, however I'm pretty sure I've got the
code dialled in, after all it's been used for more than year now in copious
numbers of machines and no one has ever noticed this before so I'm figuring
it might be a machine specific timing hole.  The machines that exhibit this
behaviour are all P166 machines and I sure as hell can't replicate it on
any other box I've got, they're all faster.  'Course it's complicated by
the fact that only certain people can produce the error with any
reliability and even then it can take them many minutes before the error
occurs but I've seen it with my eyes so I know it's there.
