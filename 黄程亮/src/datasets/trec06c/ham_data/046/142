     Denn:
     
     If I am not mistaken, and please correct me if I am wrong (anybody), 
     but I think the inductor is in the circuit to protect the NiCd battery 
     pack and rest of circuit against possible reverse electro-mechanical 
     induction by the DC motors.
     
     Motor power is on the unregulated side of the power circuit.
     
     A DC motor is to convert DC power into mechanical energy, but it can 
     also do the reverse, in this case the polarity would be opposite and 
     be harmful to the battery pack.
     
     An inductor has an impedance that rises with frequency, so at 
     f=infinity Z=high and at f=0 (DC) Z=0. 
     
     So if the motor generate electricity the coil will short them out to 
     ground and makes them stop as soon as power is removed by the L293D. 
     IC has PWM routines in it to regulate power to the motor, so there 
     will be a lot of on/off transitions, which can (and will) cause 
     electro-mechanical induction.
     
     If you plan to use motors on your handyboard, you should use a coil to 
     protect your circuit and battery against this phenomenon and the value 
     is probably chosen  based on the PWM frequencies and I would stay 
     close to this value.
     
     Best regards, Bart Schrijver.

Hi, 
I see the HB circuit and found the 1uH that connect the GND Batteries and 
GND.
I want to know the purpose of this inductor. Can I replace it with other 
value or not use it .
     
Thanks
