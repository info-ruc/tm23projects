Hi,
	I recently joined the HB club by buying a pre assemebled HB. I
soldered the battery pack terminals to the HB (yes I checked the +ve and
-ve terminals). However, when I try to follow the instructions of
downloading the .s19 file, I get "Wrong Port or board mode". Also, I
noticed that the board gets heated and when I switch the board to download
mode, the LEDs don't blink for 1/3 second.

	Could somebody tell me what I could be doing wrong? Could it be
because I am using regular batteries instead of recharables?

Thanks,
-SAtish.
