  Although the E switch's use in DMDX is redundant due to DMDX's enhanced
design it has been included to (a) provide backward compatability with
DMTG's scripts and (b) as a last resort mechanism to deal with DMDX's
enhanced design not dealing with something and leaving stuff on the screen
(although the recently added <OverSize> keyword is better at handling stray
pixels when related to unusual fonts).  Hence it's not exactly the most
tested of DMDX switches out there and has had a rather glaring hole in it's
logic for a long time in that a frame with only an E switch in it produced
no display queue element when it should have resulting in out of sync back
buffers (which results in displays containing previous frames or parts of
them).  This has been fixed in 1.1.02 which has not been released yet
because we are hunting for another more worrisome display error (that has
the same kind of dramatic symptoms) and 1.1.02 will address that issue as
well.  Basically if you have scripts with the E switch in them they should
be removed in any event as even when E is functioning correctly it has
dramatic performance degrading issues (the DMDX help file has details).
