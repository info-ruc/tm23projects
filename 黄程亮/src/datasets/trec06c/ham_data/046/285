The easy solution is to avoid using a formula that assumes anything about the motor speed curve (except of course that reducing the motor value reduces the speed).

Try using a feedback mechanism:  Keep track of the cumulative pulses from each wheel; while the difference between the two is non-zero, keep decrementing (or incrementing) one of the motor values.  This will rapidly fine tune itself to the particular characteristics of the motors, batteries, terrain, etc.  You can have a sort of speed control daemon running in a separate process.  Works for me!  Good luck.

P.S.--The *smooth* PWM routine (available from the HB web site) is probably needed for this application.
