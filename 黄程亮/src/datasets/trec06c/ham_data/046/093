  A couple of people already use batch files to process DMTG data files and
several others have been wanting to do similar sorts of things with DMDX.
Unfortunately a batch file doesn't wait for DMDX to terminate, with the
addition of the -subjid command line parameter (in 1.1.02) and a little
win32 gem below it is now possible.  With a batch file constructed along
the following lines you can store data files produced by subject ID:

start /wait dmdx.exe -subjid %1 -run itemfile.rtf
mkdir %1
move itemfile*.wav %1
move itemfile.azk %1
