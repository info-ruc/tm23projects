Hi.  You mentioned at some point maybe dooing some modelling of morphology.
 I am all fired up after Aix (it won't last....) and have a couple of ideas.  

Contestant number one....Modelling the affix priming results.  We have
no/marginal priming for non/less productive affixes, priming for productive
affixes and no priming for inflectional affixes.  The idea for the
derivational is that the productive affixes are in some way separate items
where the non prod are locally attached.  I suppose they would be more
clustered in lexical space with fewer outliers due to the freedom of use
and lower restrictions on what they bind with.  The inflections are more
so, but differ in that they are vastly more frequent and consistent, have
different functions etc.  Assuming we can get away without doing it all in
context, can we model the priming results with simple frequency,
consistency of meaning etc?  Quantitative change causing qualitative
differences.  Do three affixes, non prod, prod, inflectional.

Contestant number 2.....Delayed priming?  Why we get morph and not sem?
Simply speaking a form and meaning morphological relationship, the kind
that exists with massive frequency in the language as a whole is a much
stronger relationship than one of overlapping semantics (e.g. cello-violin)
or form (electrode-elect) which are single examples?  Can delayed priming
be modelled?  The above result is often taken as proof of a separate effect
of morphology.
