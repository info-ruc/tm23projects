I don't know if the code gets corrupted, but the LED's do not do what they 
are supposed to do in download mode once in a while. Regardless of the 
lighting of the LED's, I am still able to download the code into my 
handyboard and keep on 'botting! When I first got my handyboard I spent a 
couple hours trying to figure out which com port to use ( I got the message 
"Wrong port or board mode" ). Make sure you check to see if your'e on the 
correct com port before checking to see if there is a problem with your 
handyboard. Also, If you try downloading to the handyboard from different 
computers, note that the com port may be different.
