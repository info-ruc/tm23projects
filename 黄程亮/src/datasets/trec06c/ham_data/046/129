Subject: IRPD sensors

I have gotten some Infrared Proximity Detectors (IRPD), but no
instructions for using them with the handyboard.  These are
set up with an infrared LED on each type of the sensor, and
they are intended to give left/right/front detection.

The program that came with them is written for a basic STAMP
controller.  I don't know much about the stamps, but
it looks like the code alternately flashes the LED's and
checks the sensors.  

Can anyone give me any pointers for using these with the
handyboard?
