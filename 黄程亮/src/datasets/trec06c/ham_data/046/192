     This may sound trivial to others, but here is what I think you should 
     do.
     
     When a new handyboard is switched on without any software loaded that 
     drives the LCD display, you should see the first line fully dark and 
     the second line light. So what you see is normal.
     
     When you bring the HB in download mode, the situation stays the same. 
     Then when you download software like IC, after the download process 
     completes the LCD remains in that condition.
     
     You have to switch your board on and off to reboot and start the 
     loaded program, this is when the LCD will show: Interactive C
     version 2.8.1    plus a heart beat if IC is loaded. Since the HB is 
     used in Special test mode, the reset vector is at $BFFE, $BFFF and 
     should point to $C5000 where IC starts.
     
     
     When you have done all of this or already did this and the situations 
     remains the same, you could try to use dlm downloader in DOS, which 
     checks every byte that downloads and sees if it arrives with the 
     correct value. This checks out access to your SRAM chip and all the 
     driver logic to it. It might be that one of the 74HC chips is busted 
     and that you miss one or more of the data or address lines which 
     prevents any program from running. The above check with dlm should 
     reveal this though.
     
     Hope this helps, Bart Schrijver.

I am assembling a handyboard, and am at stage 6.0.4, where I plug in my 
LCD screen for the first time. When I turn the handy board on, instead of 
getting the dimly lit arrays, I get a top array that is strongly lit, and 
bottom array that is lightly lit. The LCD screen is LM052L. I checked the 
power and ground and they seem to be ok.
The download process goes fine, but there is no interactive C
prompt. I also checked the orientation of chips and they all seem ok. 
Finally I did a continuity check and that seems alright too.
To all the experts out there, I'd really appreciate your help. 
     
Regards,
Umar
