VI. KBH funding request b/c appeal to finboard was incongruent with
actual request

      (i.e. asked for wrong things)

	1. Russian comedy group = difficult because it was associated with
specific 	holiday. Stage supporters and sound system = big expenses
because they were not 	in "performance space"

	2. ( Roadkill Buffet received $1000 for term) 

	3 C.R.  it is easier to ask for forgiveness than permission

		a) impact on campus: great b/c MIT no longer offers Russian classes,
this 			was an opportunity to practice and learn. also extended to
Russian 				communities in Boston.

		b) Plus, if we didn't spend this money - reserves which  = $16,000

		this is a bad precedent , budget was incomplete @ time of appeals,
motion 			to vote for 15,000

			- 9-10-6 fails

		c) motion to vote for unfriendly $800 

			-6-10-9 fails

		d) motion to suspend rules in order to cont. on this issue  20-0-1

		proposed amendment = $1000 11-10-1 pass
