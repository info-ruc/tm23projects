     Jens:
     
     I recently build (last month) two handyboards and spent approximately 
     $200.- US total. I live in California.
     
     I got the components through various mail order places like: Digikey, 
     Mouser.
     And from local discount surplus electronics store HCS, who buys 
     overstocked componenets from the Silicon Valley. Very low prices and 
     all kinds of neat stuff!!!!!
     
     The display I got through Timeline in San Jose for $7.00 ea. The more 
     difficult parts like the IR sensor IS1U60 and the reset circuit 
     DS1233-10 I received as samples at 0 cost through FAI Electronics 
     distributors. (I work at HP).
     
     Boards were purchased through Douglas for ~$30.- US for one set 
     including the expansion board.
     
     Newark mail order carries the microprocessor MC68HC11A1FN for ~12.-
     
     If you do not live in the US you probably spent a lot on shipping the 
     stuff, so your best bet may be to just buy a pre-assembled board or a 
     complete parts kit, I think Douglas does have this service.
     
     Here are some web sites you may look at:
     
     www.newark.com             mail order electronics
     www.digikey.com            mail order
     www.mouser.com             mail order
     www.digisys.net/timeline/   LCD display
     www.douglas.com            PCB boards, possibly part kits.
     
     I had good success building both and they worked right out of the box, 
     no hardware errors, your success may very.
     
     Good luck, Bart Schrijver Bart_Schrijver@hp.com

     Hi all,
     
     To start with the HB I have to buy one. But where can I get a HB with 
     an acceptable price?
     Or should I buy the components to build the HB myself?
