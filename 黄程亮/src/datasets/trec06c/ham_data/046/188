I am assembling a handyboard, and am at stage 6.0.4, where I plug in my
LCD screen for the first time. When I turn the handy board on, instead of
getting the dimly lit arrays, I get a top array that is strongly lit, and
bottom array that is lightly lit. The LCD screen is LM052L. I checked the
power and ground and they seem to be ok.
The download process goes fine, but there is no interactive C
prompt. I also checked the orientation of chips and they all seem ok.
Finally I did a continuity check and that seems alright too.
To all the experts out there, I'd really appreciate your help. 

Regards,
Umar
