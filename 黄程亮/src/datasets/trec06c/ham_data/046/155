Hello all,

Thank you for all of your kind help in the past.

Here is another question that I hope is worthy of your time...

I have a motion sensor purchased from Acroname (Eltec, I forget the part
number). It works, as I had written a small program to print its values to
the Handyboard LCD. However, I am curious...

I wouldn't expect it to need to be powered up all of the time so I wired it
to a digital out on the expansion board. Do you all think that a regular
"vanilla" C program is enough to catch any changes in the value (I would
like it to be able to tell left >> right movement from right >> left)?

Would this C program need to "hog" the processor in order to catch very
quick changes in the values?

Would an assembly language interrupt routine accomplish this better?

Has anyone successfully implemented one of these?

Any help would be appreciated.


Thank you all.


Bob Kelly
