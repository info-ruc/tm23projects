     Satish:
     
     The fact that the red and green leds in the lower left corner do not 
     light up and than shut off after ~1/3 sec. means that your board does 
     not reset and goes into download mode. This is the reason why the 
     downloader states: "Wrong Port or board mode".
     
     Rechargeable NiCad's are only 1.2V per cell and regular or Alkaline 
     batteries are 1.5V per cell. So 8 cells of Nicad's translates to 9.2 V 
     total and 8 cells of regulars is: 12V total.
     
     The handyboard design is such that when power is applied with a wall 
     adapter it tries to trickle charge the NiCad's if they are hooked up. 
     I do not think it is wise to hook up regular batteries since they 
     cannot be recharged plus they try to "fight" the charging circuit.
     
     Between the batteries and the HB circuit their are two regulators, one 
     dedicated to keep the 62256 SRAM powered and one for the rest of the 
     board, so this may have protected sensitive components.
     
     The HB buy the way will run without batteries hook up and just with 
     the wall adapter plugged in.
     
     I would start by removing all CMOS components from their sockets 
     including the 68HC11 (may be difficult to get out of socket), of 
     course you cannot remove the address latch since it is soldered 
     underneath the RAM, so be careful with ESD. Then power your board with 
     just the wall adapter and check out the +5V  rail throughout the 
     board.
     
     If this checks out replace all part and just use the wall adapter, no 
     batteries.
     You may already have fried some parts though, either trough statics or 
     over power.
     
     Also, which parts get hot? You said board gets heated, but which part?
     
     
     Hope this helps out, let me know what gives.
     Bart Schrijver.
     
     P.S. For

Hi,
        I recently joined the HB club by buying a pre assemebled HB. I
soldered the battery pack terminals to the HB (yes I checked the +ve and 
-ve terminals). However, when I try to follow the instructions of 
downloading the .s19 file, I get "Wrong Port or board mode". Also, I 
noticed that the board gets heated and when I switch the board to download 
mode, the LEDs don't blink for 1/3 second.
     
        Could somebody tell me what I could be doing wrong? Could it be
because I am using regular batteries instead of recharables?
     
Thanks,
-SAtish.
