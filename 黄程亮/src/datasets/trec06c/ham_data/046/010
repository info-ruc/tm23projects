Hi Everyone,

                I am in urgent need to learn how to modify the Handy =
Board to support 3 stepper motors (without the Expansion
Board). I have absolutely no clues as to how this can be done so I would =
appreciate assistance from anyone who has tried
this before, or has any suggestion on how this can be done. Thank you =
and regards.

Victor Lee
