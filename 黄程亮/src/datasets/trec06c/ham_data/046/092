  Using the DigitalVox by itself is still broken and is going to require a
major re-write on account of DirectSoundCapture not functioning in a
consistant way (the buffer position doesn't reset to zero when stopped and
can't be set to zero as near as I can tell unless you let the buffer run to
full duration as it does with RecordVocal).  So use it in conjunction with
RecordVocal for now.  The subtle display error we're tracking in Ken's lab
is proving a very elusive thing to replicate so it's still in there too,
it's likely to be machine dependant (and item file and everything else
dependant) so shouldn't cause anyone else trouble.

  1.1.02 fixed frame with E switch by itself not being displayed, used
strrchr for filename extension changing, command line switch for subject ID
(-subjid), RecordVocal RT cue added (so you can see the RT easily when
looking at the wave files)
