I am having trouble getting the IR sensor to show values on the LCD screen.  I
am confident that it is finally hooked up correctly.  The following is what is
included in the list file to automatically download into the board:

explego.icb
lib_hb.icb
libexpbd.icb
expservo.icb
Gp2d02_i.icb
sonar.icb
/expsens.c
/lib_hb.c

Am I missing anything?

Then I load the test for the sensor from Barry's page and I still just get
"zeros" on the LCD screen.  I have hooked up the input and output of the sensor
to an oscilloscope and was able to see the pulses going to the sensor.  The
timing was a little off but in general it seemed to be receiving signals.  What
could be going wrong?  Is it hardware or software?

Thanks for all of your help.
