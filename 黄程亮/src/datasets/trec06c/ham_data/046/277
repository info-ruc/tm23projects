Subject: speed control help
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I have a problem that involves speed control.

My robot is curently configured for differential steering and have 
shaft encoders installed on each one for feedback.

the shaft encoders generate 64 pulses /rev
The motors are PWM using the rug warrior setup.

The problem is that the motors are non linear in respect to the power 
applied to them.

At full power (100%) the shaft encoders return 64 pulses/s
at 75% they return 62 pulses/s, at 50% power they return 60 pulses/s
and at 25% they return 50 pulses/s

the speed control software i'm using is assuming that the response is
linear so for 50% power it expects to see 32 pulses/s but in fact it is
receiving 50 pulses/s therefore it slows down the motor to a crawl.  

Is there a formula that I can use to solve for the expected pulses/s for
a given power input?

Any help is appreciated!
