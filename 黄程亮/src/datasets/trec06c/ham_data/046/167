Undergraduate Association Council


MINUTES

Monday, March 30, 1998



I.	Call to Order


	Floor Leader Paul Oppold called the meeting to order at 8:04PM. 
Quorum was met.


II.	Committee and Class Council Reports


	Publicity Committee


	Chair Edgar Martinez informed the Council that communication with the
Publicity Assistant had broken down, and that the committee was facing
a severe lack of manpower.  He said that the committee would be
counting on the Council to contribute to publicity efforts, especially
this week.


	Social Committee


	Co-Chair Stuart Jackson updated the Council on progress with Spring
Weekend. He reminded the Council that Spring Weekend was set for April
23-25.  Events planned include concerts by Fishbone and Five Fryers of
Funk, Alpha Phlea Market, Mr. Spring Weekend, and a visit by Senator
Kerry to the EC Picnic.


	Student Committee on Educational Policy


	Chair Jeremy Sher informed the Council that the first mailing of the
Faculty Rules should have been received by the Councilors.  He also
said that the committee was considering evening exam policies, and that
a letter notifying students of a survey on the subject has been sent
out.  He also informed the Council that the Institute Committee on the
Undergraduate Program had agreed to have a member of SCEP serve on it,
"forever and ever."


	

 	Committee on Student Life


	For Chair Sunil Rao, Paul Oppold reminded the Council that the Battle
of the Classes would be the upcoming weekend (April 4th), that it
should be a "a lot of fun", and that Councilors should inform their
constituents about the event.


	Chair Sunil Rao updated the Council on the schedule of events for the
Battle of the Classes:


		11AM:  Bands begin

		12PM:  Introduction, Ice Sculpting Begins

		12:15:  Tug of war, MIT Trivia Contest

		2PM:  Awards


	Class of 2001


	Class President Pamela Mukerji told the Council that the Class of 2001
is planning an outing to a Red Sox game on April 17th.  She also
informed the Council that the class is still working on the Big Sibling
Program, a website for academic advise for freshmen, and an end-of-term
study break.


III.	New Legislation


	Resolution of Condolence to the family of Philip Gale


		Presented by Executive Committee Member Seema Nagpal.


		Motion to approve S98-UACR1 passed unanimously.


	Bill to Establish a Permanent Multiculturalism Planning Subcommittee
in the UA


	Presented by Councilor Jeremy Sher.  There were questions from the
floor about why this could not be a standing committee, to which Sher
responded that he had been advised that the institution of this group
should be a subcommittee for legal convenience.  President Dedric
Carter informed the Council that as a subcommittee, the group would
have all the powers and responsibilities of a standing committee, but
that it would avoid the difficult process of having to amend the
Constitution.


		Motion to approve S98-UACB1 passed unanimously.


	Resolution to Express Appreciation


	Presented by Councilor Jeremy Sher.  Councilor Sher informed the
council that the tripling in student activity funding was much
appreciated, and that such a level of funding would have been
"impossible" three years ago. President Carter reminded the Council
that the goal still remained to establish a $500,000 budget for student
activities in ten years (starting 3 years ago).


		Motion to approve S98-UACR2 passed unanimously.


VI.	Good of the Order


	Councilor Jed Gordon said that any time a UA group planned to make
shirts, they should be modern and stylish, such that people would be
willing to wear them.


	Councilor Sher reminded the Council that the Martin Luther King Jr.
Vigil was planned for the upcoming weekend (April 4th), and that there
would be an open mike, readings of poetry and the "I Have A Dream"
speech, as well as a

	speech at 6 PM by Reverend Doctor David Carter.


VII.	Meeting Adjourned at 9:20 PM
