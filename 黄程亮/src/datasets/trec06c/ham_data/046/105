  (a) that address is a listerv, you're sending the mail to more people
than just me :)

  (b) you've got HTML turned on in your mail program which as you can see
below causes Eudora to spew all over the place. 

  (c) you've got some kinda of attachment thing turned on in your mail
program which is actaully malformed, you might want to turn that of as well.

  (d) and a subject is nice for the archive, like "stray pixels".


  What you should do is to remove scrambling from your item file and see if
the stray pixels turn up after the same item or whether it is in fact some
kind of random affair.  If it is random then you should observe your
presentation sequence very closely and see if the order of frames has been
corrupted, if so then you are facing the same error I am trying to solve in
Ken's lab right now.  If it always occurs at a given point then you should
decide to which side the stray pixels are occuring, the left, top, right or
bottom and then you should increase the appropriate number in the
<oversize> keyword by some small amount, for example if you notice that the
pixels are being left at the left edge of the frame then an <os 5,0,2,5> is
ok, if at the top an <os 0,5,2,5> might be required, if at the right <os
0,0,2,7>.
