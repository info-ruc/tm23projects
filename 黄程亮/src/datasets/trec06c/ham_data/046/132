I was wondering what are my options for the HB battery.  Would it be 
possible for me to get 2 battery holders each carrying 4 cells each 
and fill them with regular NiCad cells say, The one's they have at 
radio shack? Would this be a viable options to the NiCad pack that 
the parts list specifies, This component is quite costly to order to 
canada. Has anybody else done such a thing?

Thank you in advance.
