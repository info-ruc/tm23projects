  There might be a little trouble with the DigitalVOX in 1.1.00, I'm
looking at it now but essentially if the time between clockons is less than
the timeout the RT for that item will be calculated incorrectly (becuase
the capture buffer will not have been restarted on account of it already
being started) if the RecordVocal device is not used in conjunction with
the DigitalVOX device (I think).
