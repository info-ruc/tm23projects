jerry,

OK, although the bulk of the effort was getting the qmaster going
on psc1 and setting up the queues.  Now we just need to get dqs_execd
running on the rest of the hosts.

Once I do one or two nodes I'll send you the list of commands....

I'll also try to write some documentation on how to add and modify
DQS queues.  Since I think you'll be doing more of this than
configuring machines.

Also can you please send my two emails of last night back to me,
so I can refresh my thoughts on what I did and what needs to be done.

I am trying to do this on my own time so that I can honestly say it
wasn't JLAB supported in anyway (besides email...) so I'll get back to
the psc nodes tonight.

Arne
