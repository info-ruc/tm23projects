Someone in our lab is hoping to set up an experiment in which
participants have to name a picture as well as indicate with a button
press which side of the pic a simultaneously presented distractor word
is on.  He wants RTs for both responses.  Is this possible?  At first I
thought not, but then got to thinking that perhaps with zil its possible
to <mpr> both the voice key and one of the buttons?  Anyone done
anything like this before?
