   Made an interesting discovery with the TimeDX refresh rate determination 
code.  On a Pentium 166 Windows 98 machine with a new PCI NVIDIA Riva TNT2 
M64 display the refresh rate determination test would stutter and never be 
able to get a good reading no matter how low I set the number of cycles to 
time.  I tried two other recent video drivers and they all had the same 
characteristic.  Before resorting to much older video drivers just for 
grins I turned on Read between Flips to Stop Cheating Drivers which fixed 
everything.  Which is pretty damned impressive as that fix was added for 
the previous design, didn't ever think I'd need it again but didn't remove 
the code just in case it might be useful and there it is, useful again.

                                                /"\

   The obvious answer is always overlooked.
