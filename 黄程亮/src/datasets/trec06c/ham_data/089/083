Hi,

Thanks for your answer, I will do just that. Two more questions left.

First, timedx recognizes the buttons on my USB gamepads, but doesn't
mention the axis device. Is there a way to read this? Are there gamepads
which are readable in this respect?

Second, I am thinking about programming a small RT program myself in VC++.
Is it possible to get the sourcecode of DMDX/TimeDx? Maybe under certain
conditions?

Sincerely,
