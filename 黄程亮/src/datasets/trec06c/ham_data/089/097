Attn: CEO

I humbly approach you with a view that we may be able to enter into a
mutual business transaction that could be of immense benefit to both
parties.



Foremost, I should begin by introducing myself. I was a serving General,
&#8220;now retired&#8221;, and a former Minister, with the past military
administration of my country and by virtue of my past appointment I was
privileged to have secured for myself huge sums 



of money which I intend to place in to one or several profitable
business opportunities where it has the potential to grow. Back here in
my country, I have a vested interest in Real Estate/ Property
Development. 



However, on the birth of democracy, a probe panel was set up to check on
the financial excesses and mismanagement of government funds by past
serving officials of the then military administration of late General
Mobutu Seseko . This development exposed a lot



 of financial misappropriation within various government Parastatals in
so much that the present civilian government had to pass a bill whereby
those found wanting in one aspect or the other were compulsorily
restricted from traveling out of the country



 pending the outcome of investigation on them and worse still those
perceived to be living above their income, had their personal properties
confiscated. Their accounts also were frozen, Local and foreign alike 



Though I lost so much to the government, I was still able to retain a
considerable sum of money in Foreign bills, lodged with a Security/Trust
firm abroad. This, I intend to invest. And since I desire, in the near
future, to settle permanently with my family

outside my Country I will also require you to purchase a comfortable
home for me in a choice neighborhood in your Country. Prior to my trip
to join you, we shall discuss on possible investment opportunities
available and perhaps conclude arrangemen




ts on how I may have the funds lodged with the Security/Trust Company
released to you for the implementation of our intended investment
projects. However, in consideration of my present inability to
immediately travel off the shores of my country, I will



demand to legally enter into agreements with you indicating and securing
our individual entitlements from the principal sums and proceeds from
our investment projects. 



We shall discuss conclusively on this aspect. Perhaps also you can
intimate me on possible investment opportunity readily available in
which we may proceed to establish soon as all other formalities are
taken care of. This though, you will solely execute



pending my arrival in your country. 

I will expect you to reach me thus via my above contact numbers so that
we may discuss conclusively. 



Looking forward to doing business with you.



Yours faithfully, 

GEN.USMAN ABDULKAREEM(R.T.D)
