Thanks for all of the answers to my questions!  The bottom line is that I didn't RTFM. What I hoped for was something that I could evaluate quickly and move on just as quickly if it didn't appear to do the job. Install it, run it, load a couple of sample scripts and see if it could do the job. I didn't see the part about changing the script for the correct video mode. Just assumed that TimeDX was setting it for me.
 
Please bear in mind that I just started work as the programmer for the University of Canterbury Psyc. Dept. At the university I'm seeing a lot of unique one-off programs for different experiments and a small, but well-established  SuperLab user base. I've already been asked to do a program to replace a particular experiment currently running on SuperLab. Rather than writing a new program for each experiment or upgrading SuperLab at great cost because we only have a 20-user license at present and want to teach 21 students at a time, I'm hoping to find something more general purpose. Low latencies are extremely important in most cases.
 
As a bit of personal background, I've worked as a software engineer for some top game companies as well as HP, Sharp Labs of America and a place called Mini-Mitter doing realtime data collection and analysis from small animal telemetric implants on Windows 95 and its evil spawn. Up to 240 channels at 1000Hz. Of course we cheated and used special hw for the actual collection and storage, but it works. I understand the timing issues with Windows OSes.
 
So, after a couple of days of looking at DMDX I have some observations and new questions. If anyone wants to comment or answer questions I would be forever beholden. 
 
1. Actually I DID read the information about timing issues and the solutions used in DMDX before downloading the program and Jonathan's solution looks really good. Perhaps ideal. I guess the only thing I'd want to do would be to look at the code (peer code review) and maybe stick a logic analyzer on the video if this stuff hasn't been done already.
 
2. The documentation really could use an 'Easy Start'. Run TimeDX, edit example script to change video mode to xxx xxx xxx, run it. Lots of well commented sample scripts ranging from simple to detailed would be really cool. 
 
3. Along the same lines, the information on the web site about it is really good for a technical person. Enough to get me excited and want to try it. What I'm seeing though is that a good techspeak abstraction layer would help get the Psyc. PhD's to understand why it's so good. I'm like, you know, saying, "trust me, this is worth looking at" and all they're seeing is this techspeak bludgeon.
 
4. I understand the part about motivated grad students or professors learning VB or DMDX scripting, but doesn't that distract from what they really want/need to do? That's why I asked about a front end. All they want to do is get an experiment up and running. The scripting looks very powerful and functional to me as a programmer, but seems like a lot of work to a Psyc Professor. Do they even use the brain hemisphere when they work? 
 
5. Any plans to release the source or make it public domain?
 
6. Any chance of getting some programmer hooks thrown in? Just somethng simple like adding callbacks for a third party DLL or COM object or something. I apologize if that's already in there and I just need to finish RTFM.
 
7. Is anyone workng on a scripting front end already? Along the same lines, how about a wrapper or something to run an experiment and analyze group results on a network?
 
Cheers,
 
Mark
