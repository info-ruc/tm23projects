Hello,

I'm a time traveler stuck here in 2003. Upon arriving here my dimensional warp 
generator stopped working. I trusted a company here by the name of LLC Lasers 
to repair my Generation 3 52 4350A watch unit, and they fled on me. I am going 
to need  a new DWG unit,  prefereably the rechargeable AMD wrist watch model 
with the GRC79 induction motor, four I80200 warp stabilizers, 512GB of SRAM and 
the menu driven GUI with front panel XID display. 

I will take whatever model you have in stock, as long as its received certification 
for being safe on carbon based life forms.

In terms of payment:
I dont have any Galactic Credits left. Payment can be made in platinum gold or 
2003 currency upon safe delivery of unit. 

INSTRUCTIONS MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY:
Please transport unit in either a brown paper bag or box to below coordinates 
on Wednesday August 6th at (exactly 5:00pm) Eastern Standard Time on the dot. 
A few minutes prior will be ok, but it cannot be after. If you miss this timeframe 
please email me. I will not be there prior to 4:45pm EST, so do not transport 
before then.

Item is to be delivered at (out of service tennis court) located at: 
Latitude N 42.47935 & Longitude W 071.17355 and the Elevation is 119.  

WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRANSPORT ITEM BY REGULAR MEANS OF TELEPORTATION. 
THEY ARE MONITORING AND WILL REDIRECT THE SIGNAL!!
I DO NOT CARE HOW YOU HAVE TO GET IT HERE, JUST DO IT IN A WAY THAT NO SPYING 
EYES WILL POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO REDIRECT THE TRANSFERENCE. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT 
THAT YOU BE ABLE TO MONITOR THE TRANSFER.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SEND IT SO THAT THEY CANNOT REDIRECT IT??? If in doubt 
do not transport actual unit until your method of transfer can be confirmed 
as a success. You just might need to send a intergalactic courier to deliver 
item safely to me. If so be VERY careful at how they approach me IN MY WHITE CAR. 


After unit has been delivered please email me at: info@federalfundingprogram.com 
with payment instructions. Do not reply directly back to this email.

Thank You

Friday August 22nd at (exactly 4:00pm) Eastern Standard Time. A few minutes prior 
will be ok, but it cannot be after. If you miss this timeframe please email me. 
Nobody will be at those coordinates prior to 3:45pm EST, (so do not transport before then).

Item is to be delivered at beginning of Lagrange Street in Winchester, Massachusetts 
which is directly across the street from Stratford Road located at: Latitude N 42.44852 
& Longitude W 071.14651 and the Elevation is 90 feet.  

WARNING: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO TRANSPORT ITEM BY REGULAR MEANS OF TELEPORTATION. THEY 
ARE MONITORING AND WILL REDIRECT THE SIGNAL!!  I DO NOT CARE HOW YOU HAVE TO GET IT 
HERE, JUST DO IT IN A WAY THAT NO SPYING EYES WILL POSSIBLY BE ABLE TO REDIRECT OR

HOW ARE YOU GOING TO SEND IT SO THAT THEY CANNOT REDIRECT OR BLOCK IT??? If in doubt

It is best if you send a intergalactic courier to deliver, this way you can be certain 
the unit arrives ok, However If you are certain that you have the means to teleport 
unit in a safe manner please send a (separate) email to me at: 
webmaster@federalfundingprogram.com only after unit has been safely delivered with payment 
instructions.

Thanks
