   We've stuck scopes and other machines behaving as analyzers backwards, 
forwards and sideways and combined with DMDX's own internal tests with a 
bit of external hardware we've long since come to the conclusion that it's 
doing what it says it's doing.  About the only way you'd get to look at the 
code would be if you cared to visit us ;)
   DMDX's only serious liability is the user not timing a video mode 
correctly,  Video card manufacturers are constantly cheating to produce the 
fastest benchmarks and this cheating constantly foils any attempt I make to 
actually determine what the hardware is doing (I'm noticing that I have to 
check "Read Between Flips" on some machine's Retrace Rate determination and 
I never had to do that earlier).  But even that liability only winds up 
with a plus or minus one frame error in presentations.  Granted a really 
fast tachistoscopic presentation might be damaged under those circumstances 
but it's literally the worst consistent error that can be made by the programs.

   Well, there's the TimeDX overview and there's a set of demo scripts on 
the web site.

   Yep, no money for a technical writer around here, believe me.

   People just want to drive cars too, they're not interested in changing 
the oil or getting the car serviced.

   No.

   If you can make a good argument for it we'll certainly consider it.

   Several people spawn DMDX with assorted command line parameters to get 
it to do things.
