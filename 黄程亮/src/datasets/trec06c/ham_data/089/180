Hi There,
  I have been trying to get a gamepad (Microsoft Sidewinder) to work with =
DMDX or vice versa. Here is what happened:
a. went to TimeDX, saw the device there as "Microsoft SideWinder Game Pad =
USB" listed after Mouse and Keyboard, as it was already highlighted, =
clicked on test, it read "Device is pooled (0.019 ms) time base 1 ms" and =
the nine buttons were also shown in the textbox below.
b. wrote a test item file that included the command <id "Microsoft =
SideWinder Game Pad USB"> <mpr +button 1> ... on the parameter line,
c. when I ran the test file, I received a message saying=20
Input Devide <Microsoft SideWinder Game Pad USB> selection failed.
d. I also tried different names including <Creative Gameport Joystick> =
which is the name of the hardware for the game pad when I check the =
computer's hardware, I kept receiving the same message.=20

What did I do wrong or miss? Any help will be appreciated.

Nan Jiang
