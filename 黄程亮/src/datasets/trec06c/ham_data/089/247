I use both SuperLab & DMDX. Strictly my opinion:

SuperLab is almost hideously easy to pick up, but (at least the version I have,
which admittedly is not the latest) is not very easy to edit on the fly because
it uses a parameter file rather than a scripting language.  It also does not
implement Direct X controls, so if fine timing on your displays is of value it
is not the best choice.  It *does*, however, handle touch screens and point &
click mouse paradigms very nicely -but I would check with Cedrus on how
reliable the response times are for that.  SL is probably great for
undergraduate lab classes where students need to set up their own projects, and
simple research paradigms where you might want to farm out the labor to someone
with minimal technical expertise.

Compared to SL, DMDX has more precise timing and trustworthy reporting about
timing, is much more versatile, and considerably cheaper (free). That said,
even a mostly-computer-literate PhD in Psychology might get their nose bloodied
a few times in the early days of use (but it's certainly easier than writing
stuff from scratch). It looks like there other commercial packages that may
have comparable teeth to DMDX (e.g., Inquisit, EPrime), but of course they
cost. Don't know that they are any easier, haven't used them.
