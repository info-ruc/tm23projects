Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for your answers. I'll just connect the joystick-part of my
interface to four of the buttons on the pad, that should work just fine.

Considering the source code, I just wondered if the software might be open
source. Now I understand it's not. Still a big thank you for providing
DMDX, it's of great use to me!

Sincerely,

Robin van Emden
