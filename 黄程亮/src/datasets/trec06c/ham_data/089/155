Hi all,

Is there a way to set up DMDX feedback such that the feedback message stays
displayed until the user hits the 'continue' key to start the next trial?

I tried looking at <feedbackduration> but this doesn't do it - either the
feedback stays on screen after user hits space (if user hits space in
feedback duration), or the message disappears (& the user wonders why the
next item doesn't start).

I'd also like to have this behaviour for the "no response" (within response
window) feedback if possible.

Thanks in advance for any help,
Rua HM.
