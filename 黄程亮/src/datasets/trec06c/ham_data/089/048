SIMS community:

My group is looking for Linux developers with real-life project
experience, and networking experience. We want someone experienced in
development who has done projects end-to-end including testing.

Before we put the word in a job announcement, I can introduce people for
this position directly to the manager concerned. So if you're still
looking, call me at my office (below) or email me.
