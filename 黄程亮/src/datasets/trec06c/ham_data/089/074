Subject: [DMDX] coupling subject's responses with experimenter's responses

In the familiarization phase of a picture naming exp., I'd like
subject's responses to be treated just like they will be in the actual
experiment (same voice key triggering, same feedback, etc.), but I'd
like the experimenter to be able to control whether or not the subject
continues onto the next item -- i.e., if the subject produces the wrong
name, I'd like it if the experimenter could give them the correct name
and then have them name the same pic again.  I can see how to do this
(using call and return), except for the fact that <return> returns to
the *next* item.  Is there a way to immediately repeat a particular
item?

thanks for any help

Matthew
