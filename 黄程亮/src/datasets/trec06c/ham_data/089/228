              {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL}
     (RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
    {ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00 USD)One hundred and Twenty 
six million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you 
to quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and 
fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c 
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive 
this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for this 
important business trusting in you and believing  in God that you will never 
let me down either now or in future.

I am Dr. Martyn Philo, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during the 
course of our auditing  I discovered a floating fund  in an account opened 
in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account 
again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is 
floating and  if I do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited 
for nothing. the owner of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a foreigner, 
and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993.and  no other person knows about 
this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other 
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that Phillip Morris 
until his death was the manager Morris & Morris Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six million [$26,000.000] upon 
successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount to your account, The 
amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and Twenty Six million United 
States Dollars, only I want to first transfer 26,000.000 [Twenty Six million 
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I 
am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved 
to a local person here, without valid international foreign passport, but 
can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international passport or 
drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us dollars and the 
former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip Morris  is a foreigner too, [and the 
money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your 
contact address  from the Girl who operates computer, I am revealing this to 
you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, 
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this 
business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step 
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including 
the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will  bind us together  before transferring the money to any 
account of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your 
country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are  capable  and will meet up 
with instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in 
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this 
money to any
foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this 
money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for 
sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of transaction 
immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place and to build 
confidence  you can  come immediately  to discuss with me face to face after 
which I will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly 
to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that 
you are ready to
act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and 
influence to obtain all
legal approvals for  onward transfer of this money to your account with 
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries and foreign exchange 
departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total 
amount, 60% will be
for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred 
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email You should try to 
call me on my satelite phone no. 882-1646685262. if you are calling my No. 
dial the way you use to call other countries, do not put South African area 
code, because it is a satellite phone.


Sincerely,
