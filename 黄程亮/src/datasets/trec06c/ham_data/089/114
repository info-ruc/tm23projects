   Many USB gamepads have four or more buttons.  Timing on them is usually 
superior to KBs and there's certainly much less variability from one to the 
next than there is between one KB and the next.  USB 2.0 gamepads stand a 
distinct change of having millisecond accurate timing but I've yet to get 
the chance to benchmark one.

   You would have to have a method of measuring the error and even then 
you'd have to keep on trying different KBs until you found a good one.  I 
was pleasantly surprised to find that a new one the other day that someone 
needed for testing that only had a SD of 4.5 ms.

>Is there any way of knowing the range of errors?

   You have build something that presses keys at exact an interval, then 
you can use testmode 8 to benchmark a keyboard.  But most people don't have 
the wherewithal to build crystal controlled oscillators driving a solenoid...
