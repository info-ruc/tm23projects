   Let alone problems synchronizing with raster...

   Surprises hell outta me but some people say it's easy to use.  We've had 
people download DMDX and start using it and the first I've known about has 
been questions on using things like macros, go figure.  Some people read 
the manual.

   It's certainly be used as a teaching tool before.

   Not to my knowledge.  The thing people praise about DMDX beyond it's 
accuracy is that you can do pretty much anything with it.  Mind you people 
are starting to want context sensitive displays that getting to be a bit of 
challenge given DMDX's structure, it's only good at extended flexible 
decision making once a display and data gathering sequence is finished.  So 
as soon as you wrap a front end around it you've severely limited what you 
can do, many DMDX front ends have been planned, none are in use to the best 
of my knowledge.  That said people do tend to Excel to prepare scripts but 
that's not really a front end IMO.

   Not me, that's for sure.  Given the people that say DMDX is easy to use 
I gotta wonder about the competition some days...
