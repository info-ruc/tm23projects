I'm pretty sure the ssh2 is the one I built.  I think I removed the 
old executable to be sure. I will double check though.

Why isn't a DISPLAY variable being set? I don't understand why there 
isn't a variable already defined in tcsh and why the ssh isn't taking 
care of re-setting it when I log in.

Thanks for your thoughts.  Our campus is closed on Fridays (no air 
conditioning plus 100+ temperatures = noone comes to work!)  and I've 
got to run off now. I'll try out more stuff on Monday.
