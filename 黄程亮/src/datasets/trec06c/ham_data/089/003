   Having just dived into the code the answer is no.  Should be yes, but 
it's no.    I'd have enumerate another whole class of drivers like I do for 
the DirectDraw and DirectSound devices which is obviously why I never did 
it when developing all the capture stuff.  Must've plain spaced going back 
and adding all the device selection stuff.  Unfortunately I'm in the middle 
of a rather time constrained project at the moment and don't have the time 
to spend adding a whole new dimension the device selection code so it'll be 
a while before I can add it, sorry.  If the time constrained people decide 
they aren't so time constrained you might get it soon but otherwise it'll 
be weeks before I have time to do this.
