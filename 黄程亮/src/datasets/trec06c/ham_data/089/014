Hi Berkeley Linux Users,

I am having trouble getting a linux  RH8 box to open windows up using 
ssh. The main purpose is to have a student log in to terminal A, ssh 
to terminal B and bring windows from terminal B over to show up on 
terminal A.  This usually works seemlessly with ssh. The true test 
that something is broken is that when i ssh from terminal A to 
terminal A, I get the same error message and no windows pop up. This 
is not true when I do B to B.

I compiled ssh from ssh.com and the same version is on both 
computers. The 8.0 box is running something called ssh-agent whenever 
you log in.  When I kill off that process, the user is 
unceremoniously logged out.  I can't seem to locate where that 
process is started, nor why it is not configured correctly... What is 
this process and how can I stop it from running at login?

First diagnostic: I can make windows on A pop up on A if I (under tcsh)
setenv DISPLAY :0.0
after the ssh login
Why isn't the DISPLAY environment getting set automatically? Where 
does this get set normally?

Second: If I ssh to B from A and then setenv DISPLAY to IPaddress:0.0 
the error message is approximately, cannot open display. I suspect 
there is some other way to specify the display when ssh is used, but 
it IS SUPPOSED TO BE AUTOMATIC! and it was on 7.3 (default factory 
install!).

Invoking ssh with the -X flag does not fix the problem.

ps - I can't install rh 7.3 on the problematic machine since it is 
not my machine.
