   As the message says, you're missing a frame delimiter, you probably want 
the comma after the quotes:

0  <ln 1>"INSTRUCTIONS:",
<ln 2> "Press the left key if the bar grows from the left," 
==========HERE========== <ln 3>"Press the right key if the bar grows from 
the right", <ln 4> "Press Space Bar to start", <ln 5> "Ready?"/;
