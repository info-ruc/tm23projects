   DMDX 3.0.2.1 contains a small fix to the macro definition code so that 
if someone say uses <ms%> as a switch instead of a keyword, ms%2000 instead 
of <ms% 2000>, DMDX's macro definition code throws an error that leads more 
light on the issue that it would in the past.  Actually fixed a typo that's 
been in there for about a decade -- perhaps longer.
