Lovin' the discussion.

I'm well pleased to hear more details about other experiment-running tools
as I never have the time to fully evaluate em.

So I'm pleased to hear that EPrime has some good points.

Not to take away from DMDX - a very useful tool, with quick support, and a
great price.

syer later
Rua.

I would disagree with this statement.  E-Prime's object-oriented
programming has been both more flexible and more powerful than what I've
been able to achieve in DMDX, especially with respect to being able to
use multiple I/O boards in different I/O configurations.  We've also
gotten slightly better timing using E-Prime (.2-.4 ms slop on E-Prime
vs. .6-.8 ms slop on DMDX, using a 100 Hz refresh rate).  Plus, while
we've been able to teach undergrads how to program a fully functional
and publishable E-Prime program in a couple of weeks, we had to go
through three undergrads over a year to get a DMDX study up and running
(and while they understood the fundamentals of E-Prime programming, they
never got the hang of what DMDX was all about in the couple of months
they worked on it individually).

True 'nuff; it's also limited in the types of pictures (.bmp and .jpg
only) and sounds (.wav only, as far as I know) it will present, and it's
got some array declaration issues that are kinda screwy (and can't be
fixed because it's based on Visual Basic).  However, if I remember
correctly, they're working on implementing video support in the next
release, and they're also working on being able to poll the joystick
axes (rather than just reading the buttons, as it and DMDX both are
currently limited to doing, from what I gather).

Nonetheless, I remain amazed at what's been done on DMDX thus far, and
I've been happy to see how willing Jonathan is to incorporate new
features that the community might want and/or need.  And you certainly
can't beat the price!  I've even used DMDX to do some clinical tasks for
an OCD client I had to pretty good effect.
