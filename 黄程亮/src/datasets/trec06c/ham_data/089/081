   Use a macro that expands to a test that jumps back to a stub item if it 
needs to:

0 "Instructions"
mT+ some test condition that branches to -555 if the item needs doing over+;


~555;
+1 item that gathers response;
~556 ~T;

~555;
+2 another item that gathers response;
~556 ~T;

                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X
