Subject: linux backup solutions?

So, I've web searched and found a variety of options, but I'm curious
if anyone here has advice on a backup solution for linux?

(I have been doing rather haphazard writes of DVD+RW's of various 
directories when I think of it and want to get something more 
systematic going.)

The system has several large (2x 70gig, 1x 15gig) hard drives and the backup
media will be DVD+R (or DVD+RW), which are 4.7gig.
The system is running RH8.

The ideal backup system would let me do a global backup and then allow
incremental backups each night (i.e. pop a blank dvd in the drive as I leave).

Anyone have any good ideas?

thanks!
