NIGERIAN LIQUIFIED GAS 
LAGOS CENTRAL OFFICE 
LAGOS-NIGERIA. 
DEAR sir 

RE: TRANSFER OF USD28, 500,000.00(TWENTY EIGHT MILLION, FIVE 
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) TO A SAFE ACCOUNT. 

I wish to intimate you with this proposal in my capacity as Chief 
Accountant and full agreement with the Auditor-General of this 
Company (Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas). We scruintinised all 
records and the accounts of awarded and executed contracts of 
this company (NLNG) during the previous military regime, since 
the inception of democracy in Nigeria and carefully uncover and 
mapped out a whooping sum USD $28.5m which we want to transfer to 
your account as the beneficiary. It might interest you to know 
that beginning of this current civilian government at a working 
asset capital of USD 3billion and will definitely gulp more USD 2 
billion on the completion of the fifty parts. You can 
authentically apply for supply if it interests you to be our 
client with full guarantee from me. The money $28.5m has been 
approved for payment by this company NLNG, the Federal Ministry 
of Finance (endorsed by the Accountant General of the Federation) 
and to be paid by the Apex bank of Nigeria. Under contract 
number, NLAG/FGN/FMF/CBN/B2517/99. As top civil servants, we are 
not allowed to operate foreign bank accounts hence our decision 
to use your account in full trust and confidence to transfer 
this money outside Nigeria. We have accepted you as our foreign 
partner and will regularize and update the approvals to reflect 
you as true beneficiary of the contract sum USD$28.5m 


(TWENTY EIGHT MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS). 
Moreover, it is pertinent to note that it is not risky and does 
not require many engagements since we have taken care of the deal 
in full capacity. 

We have resolved to give you 25% of the total sum for your 
assistance. If you are interested in this deal, please contact me 
through my email. Address above for more likely information. 
Remember to give me your phone number and your fax lines through 
which I can send you approved document for your perusal. 

I am anxiously waiting for your response with hope that you will 
understand the confidential nature of this transaction. 

Best regards, 

ENG.Ben Udo
