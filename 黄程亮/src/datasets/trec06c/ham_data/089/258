<P>From: Dr=2E Sule Gidado=2E<BR>E-mail:s_gidado2000@yahoo=2Ecom <BR>AT=
TENTION PLEASE</P>
<P><BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; A very pleasant day to you=2E<BR>It is my great ple=
asure writing you this letter on behalf of my <BR>colleagues=2E I have =
decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in <BR>the executi=
on of a deal hereunder for the mutual benefit of all parties, and <BR>w=
ould urge you to keep it confidential because of its sensitive nature=2E=
<BR>Dr=2E Sule Gidado is my name, 52 years old and a renowned economist=
, happily <BR>married with 2 lovely children=2E Special Adviser on petr=
oleum affairs to the <BR>former Military Head of State and presently, C=
hairman of the Contract Review <BR>Panel (C=2ER=2EP) appointed by the n=
ew Civilian administration, with the mandate <BR>to re-evaluate, scruti=
nize, approve and recommend for payment all previously <BR>awarded and =
executed contracts for the Petroleum Trust Fund (P=2ET=2EF)=2E With <BR=
>the co-operation of two other top officials, we have in our possession=
 an <BR>overdue payment in US funds totaling $29=2E6million US=2E</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The said funds represent certain percentage of the cont=
ract value executed <BR>on behalf of the Petroleum Ministry by a consor=
tium of foreign contracting <BR>firms (ABB Lummus J=2EG=2EC of Japan, J=
ulius Berger of Germany and Fouguerolle <BR>of France) for Engineering =
and procurement work in Rivers and Delta State of <BR>Nigeria in 2002, =
which was over-invoiced=2E Though the actual contract cost <BR>(US$500 =
M) has been paid to the original contractor, leaving this excess <BR>ba=
lance unclaimed=2E</P>
<P>&nbsp; The Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria under the a=
ble <BR>leadership of President Olusegun Obansanjo believes that privat=
e investment <BR>in general, and foreign direct investment in particula=
r, are the real <BR>engines for sustainable economic development, for w=
hich reason it has <BR>continued to encourage investments in the key gr=
owth-oriented sector of <BR>Petroleum/Crude Oil with sincere determinat=
ion to pay foreign contractors <BR>all debts owed to them, so as to con=
tinue to enjoy close relationships and a <BR>mutually beneficial co-ope=
ration with foreign governments and <BR>non-governmental financial agen=
cies=2E As a result we included our bills for <BR>approvals with the co=
-operation of some officials at the Ministry of Finance <BR>and the Cen=
tral Bank of Nigeria (CBN)=2E</P>
<P>&nbsp; Due to the fact that we are still in active Government servic=
e and are not <BR>allowed to own/operate foreign accounts while in serv=
ice in accordance with <BR>the laws of my country, we were compelled to=
 contact you and more so, owing <BR>to the fact that the contract was d=
one by foreign contractors and payments <BR>made in foreign currency (U=
nited State Dollars), the more reason we urgently <BR>need your assista=
nce to receive and secure this fund for us=2E</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; All modalities for the successful transfer of this fund=
 including legal <BR>and administrative requirements in Nigeria as well=
 as that of International <BR>Arbitration has been worked out=2E We hop=
e to conclude this transaction within <BR>ten (10) banking days once yo=
u open communication with me to furnish me your <BR>willingness and by =
fax reconfirm the following information needed for easy <BR>transfer of=
 the fund:</P>
<P>(1) Your company or full names<BR>(2) Company Address<BR>(3) Phone/F=
ax Numbers<BR>(4) Bank Name, Address, Account Name, Number and any othe=
r information=2E<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp; I have the authority of my colleag=
ues involved to propose that, should you <BR>be willing to assist us in=
 this transaction your share as compensation will <BR>be 20% while my c=
olleagues and I shall receive 75%, and the balance of 5% <BR>shall be u=
sed to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous <BR>expenses=
 so incurred=2E</P>
<P>&nbsp; It does not matter whether or not you/your company does proje=
cts of the <BR>nature described here=2E The assumption is that your com=
pany won the major <BR>contract and subcontracted it to other companies=
=2E More often than not, big <BR>trading companies and firms of unrelat=
ed fields win major contracts and <BR>subcontract same to more speciali=
zed firms for execution=2E</P>
<P>&nbsp; This business itself is 100% safe and risk free, as long as y=
ou treat it <BR>with utmost confidentiality=2E Also your specialization=
 is not a hindrance to <BR>the successful execution of this mutually be=
neficial transaction=2E I am <BR>reposing a great deal of confidence in=
 you here and hope that you will not <BR>betray/disappoint us=2E</P>
<P>Best regards,<BR>Dr=2E Sule Gidado=2E</P>
<P>NB=2E Bank Account details would not be necessary, if preferred mode=
 of <BR>payment is by solar bank draft or telegraphic transfer=2E Your =
reply to this <BR>mail should be sent to: <A href=3D"mailto:s_gidado200=
