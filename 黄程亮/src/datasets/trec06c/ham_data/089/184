Good Afternoon,

Due to the large number of hosts that are infected with the W32/Blaster 
worm, I am sending out this bulk announcement about hosts whose traffic is 
being blocked with a null route in order to suppress our involvement in the 
spreading of this worm.

Here is what you need to do if your host is in the list:

	1. Perform a complete reinstallation and patching of the system.
	2. Send an email message to security@ucsb.edu to inform us that
	   the host is now safe to be connected with the internet. When
	   referring to multiple IP addresses, please list the IP addresses
	   on separate lines.

Here is the list of infected hosts:

It is expected that this report will be updated frequently as more
information is discovered.  Readers are advised to download/refresh
it throughout the day to ensure that any new information is not missed.

Thank you and good luck,
