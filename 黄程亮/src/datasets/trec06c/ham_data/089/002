Hi,

in an attempt to improve recording quality on my laptop, I've added a USB 
Soundblaster Extigy card. Using the latest version of DMDX, and Windows 
98SE, Time DX recognises the card, and allows sound files to be played out 
on it. However, sound recording using RecordVocal still appears to use the 
onboard sound card. Is there any way of setting DMDX to use the external 
card for recording as well as playback?

Thanks,

Gareth Gaskell
