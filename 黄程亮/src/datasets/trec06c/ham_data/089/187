I've been using a combination of rsync and dvd+rw backup for
linux and windows machines on the berkeley astro network.

It's not particularly sophisticated, but gets the job done.
You can run rsync in a mode where it will only copy over files
that have been modified since some previous checkpoint and you
can specify that it create a copy of the older version automatically.

I'm still on the look out for a better solution though.
