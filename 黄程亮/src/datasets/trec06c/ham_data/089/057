Pepi - Due to travel by the bulk of the team this is a "well-toned"
outline (somewhere between thin and fat). I will send more by next
week if I get more input or more time. Also if you suggest places to
focus I will attempt to do that between now and July 14. 

In the meeting we discussed the importance of having the Science objectives 
fallout of the NASA goals and Strategic plan.  It is in this context that I
believe the virtues of stellar X-ray science of the most clear.



In terms of the Space Science strategy Our group 
1)	*Flares of stars in the solar neighborood
	*Galactic star formation regions
		==>Jeremy Drake, Nancy Evans, Scott Wolk, Bob Rosner
		+ Vinay Kashyap
		
fulfills five categories within two themes outside of SEU.

The Letters and Arabic numerals below are copied for the NASA Space Science 
strategy.

OUTLINE:

I Science Justification
  A Sun Earth Connection
	1) Understand the changing flow of energy in throughout the
	   Heliosphere and and planetary environments.
		
		i) The only way the study the changing flow of energy
		through the sun is to study other "SUNs" at various
		ages. There are only a handful of Solar type PMS stars 
		bright enough for Xray spectroscopy today.
		Con-X will be able to measure the properties of many 
		ZAMS G stars But stars with log (Lx/Lbol) = -6 (solar-like) 
		are probably beyond its capability.
		  Solar flares (which obviously have an immediate and 
		potentially drastic effect on the Earth) can be better 
		understood by considering the changed controlling
		parameters (such as gravity, rotation rate, convection depth)
		present in other stars.
		
		---> References (Feigelson 2002; ONC, Glassgold 2001 theory
		     Work of Baliunas and collaborators HK project) 

		ii) We would be able to see to 2 kpc what CXO sees at 500 pc. 
		i.e we could study star formation in about 20
		Massive star forming regions with the spatial
		resolution of CXO and the spectral resolution of (better 
		than) Con-X.  We know ROSAT induced biases in out 
		understanding of star formation (we modeled on
		Taurus) now we think mostly about Star formation in 
		the context of the ONC.  In truth we know that 
		this is still a modest Star Forming region. Most star
		formation goes on in the superclusters further in.

		 several superimposed CON-X of Kastner HETG
		 spectra, or Con-X spectra.)

		 REQUIRED MATH: Flux of M6 PMS star at 2kpc
		 Flux of M9 PMS brown dwarf at 2 kpc


	2) Understand the physical properties of Space plasma
		i) Coronal tomography.  Will be able to produce 3-D
		maps of the corona above nearby active stars.
		
		 --> I'll add more this week


  B) Astronomical Search for Origins	


	2)Learn how stars and planetary systems form and evolve.
		i) What is the energy of a flare and what are the 
			effects	of this on disk chemistry (c.f. Feigelson 2002)

		ii) able to spatially resolve flares in  HH30! We will
		    learn what fraction of the disk is directly 
		    affected by the flare and we would know whether 
		    these were star-star flares, 
		    disk-disk flares or star-disk flares. (c.f. Kastner)
		    
		-->Figure HH30 with a flare, 1 AU in length overlain. 


	3) Understand the diversity of worlds which may harbor life.
		i) we will be able to study the X-ray environment of 
		   every planet detected to date.
		    REQUIRED MATH: what is the X-ray  flux of K0 MS
		star at 100 pc. 


		ii)It has been argued that even after the sun reaches
		the ZAMS and the Earth is in the so called "habitable
		zone" with respoect to temperature, 2 effects prevent
		the immediate evolution of life.  1) regular high mass 
		impacts and 2) huge X-ray flares.  X--ray flares may
		be more significant as the impacts dies out within 200 
		Myr and active flaring may continue to sterilize
		planets for 1 Gyr.

		iii) Could detect comets and perhaps jupiter around
		nearby stars?




 C) SEU
      3) Understanding the development of the structure and cycles of
	  matter of the universe.
		 i) XRB Formation and Evolution:  Binary Populations
		    This is a particularly important topic, for instance for 
		    understanding interacting binaries and the X-ray 
		    sources in nearby galaxies.  

		    The basis of understanding XRB is understanding binary 
		    populations: frequency, distributions of separations, etc.
		    they start from, as well as the physics the interactions
		    within the evolving systems.
		    X-ray studies can "close the loop" for massive stars in 
		    multiple systems.  That is, B stars in general do not 
		    have X-rays.  Over the next 20 years, improved resolution
		    (all the way to SIM) will vastly improve our knowledge of 
		    wide companions. Copious velocity measures will greatly 
		    lengthen the list of close binaries.  However, low mass 
		    companions (necessary to complete the picture) are
		    elusive.
		    Since at least some of the rare B stars known to
		    have X-rays are thought to have low mass X-ray
		    producing companions, X-ray studies will reveal
		    companions undetected by other means.  Even 
		    more remarkable, if no X-rays are present in young 
		    B Stars, it is proof that they do not hava a low
		    mass companion (nearly impossible to prove by
		    other means.)  
			  To push the results further in star 
		   forming/young star regions, this requires both high 
		   resolution, as well a more collecting area.
