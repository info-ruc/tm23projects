Hi again linux users.  

First off, thanks to all who have already provided a
wealth of suggestions to keep me busy all morning. 

But, I am still stuck. 

Here is the question:

What should I manually set the display to when i
remotely log in using ssh. I am logging in from a
machine without a name (only an IP address).  For
instance, if I log in to the console, the DISPLAY is
:0.0 or localhost:0.0. 

What can I specify to manually identify the DISPLAY
environment when I do a ssh login to another machine?

(no, none of the fixes suggested so far make the ssh
decide what the display is for itself! manually
specifying it will work though, at least when i log
in to the same machine).  

The error message is:
xterm Xt error: Can't open display:
when no DISPLAY set. 
> setenv DISPLAY :0.0
makes windows pop up for ssh2 localhost

logging in to remote machine with 
> ssh2 remote
> setenv DISPLAY 139.myip.xxx.xxx:0.0
> xterm &
yields following error message

xterm Xt error: Can't open display: 139.myipxxx.xxx:0.0

Any more help out there?
