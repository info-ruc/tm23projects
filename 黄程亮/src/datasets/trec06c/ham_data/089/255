Not had the same kind of problems with DMDX you describe.  I think the 
language in DMDX can be a problem, e.g. explaining what a "refresh rate" is 
and how this controls timing etc. but I got a first year undergraduate 
class of, to be honest, fairly low level, to write a simple lexical 
decision experiment in a few weeks.  I did however skip over some of the 
more difficult stuff (I/O cards) and just give them some bits with minimal 
explanation e.g. "that bit makes the text red".
