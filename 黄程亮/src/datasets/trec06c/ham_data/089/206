   Hmm, sounds like problem is more wide spread.  Guess I'll have to do 
some DMDX benching to see if this is really affecting DMDX or whether it's 
just TimeDX.  TimeDX actually represents a pretty stressful workload 
compared to DMDX as it generates a whole new screen of info as often as it 
can and on a quick processor that's every tick.

   Also I guess more specificity is required.  The two devices that 
identify the main chipset (the north bridge) have "Processor to AGP 
Controller" and "Processor to I/O Controller" in the name.  Devices with 
801 in them are the south bridge chipset and while I see them in the poorly 
functioning machines I also see them in the development box that is 
flawless, it's main chipset AGP ID is E7000 and  I/O ID is E7205.

Justice is incidental to law and order.
