Doug :

    An elegant and simple solution.

    One note -- on many unix platforms (Solaris included), some 
utilities, including tar, cannot handle arbitrary-sized files. The file 
size can be relatively small -- of order a gigabyte, which will 
definitely have an impact on making backups. However, Gnu's version of 
tar (named, appropriately, gtar) does not have this limitation. Lest 
someone be confronted with an unpleasant surprise when attempting to 
recover a backup corrupted by the finite-size limitation of tar, I 
would recommend first testing their version of tar installed against a 
large junk file.

   Best,

   Bob
