Dear users,

I just started reading maunals of DMDX and have some problems.
I want to run experiments in which I need four buttons or keys for subjects
to press and measure the response time as accurately as possible.
Is there any device which has four buttons and can measure RT with
millisecond adduracy?
If keyboard is the only possibility for four buttons, how can I make errors
as small as possible?
Is there any way of knowing the range of errors?
