   Without having a device here I can't say.  I can use the "logitech 
cordless USB mouse" here so I don't think it's anything to do with USB or 
long device names.  My guess is that you'll have to carefully check that 
the name you provide in the input file is exactly the name TimeDX provides, 
like perhaps it's GamePad and not Game Pad, perhaps you've got two spaces 
instead of one some place.  Case doesn't matter.  Perhaps that opening 
fancy quote is screwing things up, you can always look at rtfparsed.txt to 
get an idea, the quotes should be gone there.

Did you know that if you took all the economists in the world and lined
them up end to end, they'd still point in the wrong direction?
