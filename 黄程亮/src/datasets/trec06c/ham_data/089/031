To manually set your DISPLAY environment variable, you should
do the following:

local % ssh remote

remote % w zodiac
(look for your IP)

(for [t]csh)
remote % setenv DISPLAY IP:0.0
(for [k,ba]sh)
remote % DISPLAY=IP:0.0;export DISPLAY

then:

local % xhost +remote

then:

remote: xclock

You should have a nice new xclock window appear on the local
display.
