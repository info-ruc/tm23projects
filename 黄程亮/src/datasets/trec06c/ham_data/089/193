Hi,
      Regarding the gamepad, I think I know what the problem is now but don't know if there is a way around it.
      In TimeDX, the device name is "Microsoft SideWinder Game Pad USB". There is a superscript Register symbol after the first two words in the name. I added the R symbol in the item file, but DMDX does not recognize it. As a result, there is a mismatch between what is showing in TimeDX and what is recognized by DMDX. So I am still getting the selection failed message. I think this may be the cause of the problem. 
      Is there a way to resolve it? Help appreciated.

   Without having a device here I can't say.  I can use the "logitech 
cordless USB mouse" here so I don't think it's anything to do with USB or 
long device names.  My guess is that you'll have to carefully check that 
the name you provide in the input file is exactly the name TimeDX provides, 
like perhaps it's GamePad and not Game Pad, perhaps you've got two spaces 
instead of one some place.  Case doesn't matter.  Perhaps that opening 
fancy quote is screwing things up, you can always look at rtfparsed.txt to 
get an idea, the quotes should be gone there.

Did you know that if you took all the economists in the world and lined
them up end to end, they'd still point in the wrong direction?
