Hi Henry --

   The solution I've been using for the last 3 years is admittedly old
   fashioned, but it has gotten the job done for me so far.  I just use the old
   "tar" command, which allows you to make incremental backups based on the
   modification times of files.  That is, I first create a complete gzipped
   tarball backup of my entire directory structure as root:

tar --atime-preserve -pzcvf - * | cat > backup.tar.gz

   You can of course have the 'backup.tar.gz' file written to any directory (or
   media). 
   Then, whenever I want to make an incremental backup:

tar --newer-mtime 20030619 --atime-preserve -pzcvf - * | cat > backup.20030620.tar.gz

  --> This command creates a gzipped compressed tar file that contains the
  --> entire directory structure of the parent directory, but only the *files*
  --> that have been modified since (and including) the date indicated after
  --> the "--newer-mtime" in the tar command.

   Although I'm of course interested in any slicker ideas that are out there,
   this backup method did successfully allow me to recover from one painful
   hard disk crash last year.
