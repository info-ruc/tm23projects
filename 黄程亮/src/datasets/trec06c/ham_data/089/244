The great advantage of DMDX is that with no previous experience you can get 
viable experiments up and running fairly quickly.  A lot of folk here use 
VB (especially for fMRI experiments) but it takes them a lot of time before 
they are writing their own programs, they usually rely on other folk to do 
it for them to begin with or have to wait six months before they start 
their experiments.  Of course it depends on what you want to do.  I see no 
reason to learn e.g. VB, if all you want to do are things like lexical 
decision, naming etc.

I've found it fine for that.
