I think DMDX is very good in terms of time it takes for you to get from 
complete beginner to running reasonably simple experiments.  Obviously it 
helps a lot to have a decent techy around that can do the setting up and 
checking timimg etc.  You can nick bits of other folks scripts fairly 
easily, which is why I made my tutorial pages (on which, once I have my 
thesis finished in a few weeks, I will do a complete overhaul).

Of course in the early days of car travel, being a car-mechanic was 
considered quite high status...
