Hi,

I would like to customize a reaction-time joystick/button-box for use with
DMDX. In order to do this I'd have to use a joystick interface. Now I
wonder if I'd best use an USB or a Gameport type joystick. I can't find a
lot of data on usb interfaces, which makes me lean towards the gameport
solution. Should I just try some cheap usb and gameport joysticks and test
them? Another possibility would be to use the USB based PIO which Jonathan
mentions on the list.

What am I to do? Anyone got any experience on this subject?

Regards,

Robin van Emden
