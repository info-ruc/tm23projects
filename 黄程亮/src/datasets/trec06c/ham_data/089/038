   Looks like NVIDIA have finally cured their display drivers.  I have a 
Dell something or other here that has a NVIDIA 440 MX display in it with 
display drivers labelled 4.2.3.8 (42.38) _without_ DirectX 9 on it, just 
the DirectX 8.0 or DirectX 8.1 that XP SP1 comes with and it didn't crash 
my crash tests at 640x480x8 or 1024x768x16.  Only took them them three or 
four years, hey, what am I complaining about?
