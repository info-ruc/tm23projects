This is only automatic if both the host from which you are running
ssh has it either configured in the /etc/ssh[2]/ssh_config file
or you specify -X or +x on the command line AND the target machine
is configured to allow X11 tunneling in its configuration file,
/etc/ssh[2]/sshd_config

The commercial version of ssh that you have compiled uses the
syntax +x instead of -X, so try that first.
