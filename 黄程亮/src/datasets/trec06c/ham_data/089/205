Greetings College of Engineering Faculty & Staff!

The Fall Semester is a less then two weeks away and there is important
information I would like to share with you from The FSU Career Center and
our Satellite Placement Office at the College of Engineering.

1.	There will be three career expos. sponsored by FSU held during the Fall
2003 Semester: 1) Engineering Day 2003- Thurday, Sept 18 at the College of
Engineering 9 to Noon & 1 to 4. 2) Seminole Futures- Friday, Sept 19 at
the Civic Center 9 to Noon & 1 to 4 3) The Grad School & Law Expo- Monday,
Oct 13 at the Woodward Union Plaza 9 to 1. These expos are open to all
FAMU & FSU Students, Faculty, Staff, and Alumni. Information about
participating organizations can be found on-line at www.career.fsu.edu
under the correct link found on the right of your screen. Please pass this
information on to your students of all levels and use the opportunity to
network and share the good things going on at the College of Engineering.
Remember to tell your students they should attend all expos because some
employers will only attend one and they don't want to miss opportunities!

2.	The FSU Career Center now encourages all FSU Students to register with
the Career Center on-line via Seminole CareerNet. This formally links the
student to career development information & programming. It is especially
important that students in their junior and senior years register, as it
is required for those wanting to participate in on-campus fulltime and
internship interviewing, FSU’s Resume Books, Job Search Agents, Mock
Interviewing, and Job Listing. Information and steps are available
on-line. Please direct all your students to www.career.fsu.edu for more
information or to our office.

3.	There is now a new SENIOR SITE for FSU’s Graduating Seminoles. Please
refer Seniors to www.seniors.fsu.edu for information and help on job
searching, on-campus interviewing, grad school application, career fairs,
and more! Help your students start planning early and with a smooth post
FSU transition.

4.	The Career Center is available to do workshops or short presentations
in your classes. If you would like us to speak on: Job Searching,
Interviewing, Resume Writing, Second Interviewing, Transition from College
to Work, The FSU Career Portfolio, or more… please contact me at
pheaton@admin.fsu.edu or 644-8625/410-6171. In addition to scheduling your
own workshop or brief Career Center Overview in your course, please refer
students to the following workshops at the College of Engineering:
Wednesday, September 10, 6pm: Resume Writing - A125
