     A recent problem is devices having cute little symbols as part of the 
name making it very hard to get the name of a device into an item file.  To 
combat this version 3.0.2.4 of DMDX dumps the names of available input 
devices into the diagnostics, not only that it also checks a parsed version 
of the name that has unusual characters removed from it that is also 
printed in brackets.
