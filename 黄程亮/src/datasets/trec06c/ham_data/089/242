   The mode you select time TimeDX has no correlation with the mode DMDX 
uses, it only affects the mode TimeDX will test.  DMDX either uses 
640x480x8 at 0Hz or whatever the <VideoMode> keywords tells it to 
use.  TimeDX must be used for each video mode that DMDX might use, you have 
to select that video mode and you must time and save those values in the 
registry.  Which brings us to 640x480x8 0Hz vs. 640x480x8 75Hz.  Under 
older versions of windows video drivers only ever enumerated 0Hz video 
modes meaning no control over refresh rate, you take whatever the default 
is.  Under XP (and maybe 2000) you can now select the refresh rate you want 
and these are all distinct from 0Hz mode which is what is used by DMDX by 
default.
