Hi,
   I want to put the computers in the waiting room, and monitors, headsets and gamepads in the testing room. I have to use a few meters of cables to connect them. Is there any special kind of cable/wire to use for connecting the headset and gamepad to the computer in the other room? prefered brand or required specifics? any information will be appreciated.
