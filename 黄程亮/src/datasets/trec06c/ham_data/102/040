   Some machines need to have the "Read Between Flips to stop Cheating 
Drivers" check box checked in the Refresh Rate test.  In the unlikely 
circumstance this doesn't get it you'll have to drop the number of cycles 
to test in that same dialog till it can get a good sample -- but the 
accuracy of the refresh rate determination will be impaired and you might 
have to enter the refresh rate manually in the Time Video Mode tests.  Tons 
of discussion in the TimeDX help.
