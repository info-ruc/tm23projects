IFAC SYMPOSIUM ON ROBUST CONTROL DESIGN (ROCOND'06)
Toulouse, France, July 5-7, 2006

www.laas.fr/rocond06
rocond06@laas.fr

This IFAC Symposium on Robust Control Design is the 5th of the series,
following Rio de Janeiro (1994), Budapest (1997), Prague (2000)
and Milan (2003). It will take place in the ancient tobacco factory
(manufacture des tabacs), in the historical center of Toulouse.

SCOPE
The field of robust control provides the theoretical principles and
the numerical tools used to design engineering control systems that
give adequate performance within an uncertain environment. Robust
control theory is built on applied mathematics, operations research
(optimization) and computer science (complexity and algorithm
theory). Deeply rooted in rigorous mathematics, the aim of robust
control is to develop theoretical and computational tools for
versatile practical applications ranging from guidance and control of
aerospace systems, control systems for the manufacturing industries,
and control of communication systems. The symposium aims at bringing
together experts from control theory (applied mathematics, convex
optimization) and applied control engineering (aerospace,
biotechnologies) to discuss the state-of-the-art in robust control.
