Subject: [DMDX] Feedback to blindman.

Hello everyone,

    I've made a program of auditory Inhibition of Return (IOR). Now, I want to put
it to the blindman. You know, blindman can't see the FEEDBACK on the screen, and
It's unsuitable to use auditory feedback. So, I think If blindman made a fault,
the program will stop there,when blind subjects find this, they will know that
they have made a fualt. How can I do this? Please tell me, thank you very much.
