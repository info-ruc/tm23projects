   You can't, or if you do it (a) serves no purpose and (b) the times I've 
accidentally run a TFT faster than 60 Hz it's washed the display out.  TFTs 
are another whole kettle of fish, the only time you need to be careful is 
doing tachistoscopic displays with a TFT with a slow response time -- which 
you can't do.
