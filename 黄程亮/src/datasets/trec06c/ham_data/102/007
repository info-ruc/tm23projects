No, you are correct.  I had singled out the ones on constraint propagation
just because they were the ones on my mind.

The ones you point to have SOME ties to Sun hardware, and Sun probably IS
entitled to patent hardware/software implementations of the basic interval
operations.  However, as I read the patents you list, yes, any software
package that implements interval multiply or divide as [min, max] of the
four combinations of endpoint probably infringes Sun's patents.

Those claims seem entirely unenforceable, and I have no intention of
changing my behavior or that of my codes to work around them.  I think it
unlikely that Sun would come after individual researchers (unless by these
messages I distinguish myself as a prime target), but commercial vendors
(e.g., Microsoft Excel might have intervals under the hood) may have some
risk.  Microsoft can probably defend itself, but smaller firms might not.
