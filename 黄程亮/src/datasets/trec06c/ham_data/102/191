   It occurs to me that I've had a request or two for looping background 
audio in DMDX around here, each time the problem has been solved easily by 
other means however I can see the need arising for it in the future.  This 
would be implemented with a looping audio command that I'm reasonably sure 
exists in DirectSound (haven't checked yet), that is a <wav> frame would 
have a modifier that makes it play continually.  The question becomes more 
interesting in how that background undergoes change, the easy way and 
therefore the likely route I would take would be to have some keyword that 
cancels all looping audio when the item is parsed and then when the item 
executes another <wav> would be played with the looping option -- meaning 
there would be a gap between them.  Is this acceptable for the recent audio 
query?
