Martin and the reliable computing community,

Please see my interpolated comments.

On the other hand, there is a history of users thinking that the
code "works" while it is giving incomplete or erroneous answers, because
the code used is non-validated.  An example of this is the prize-winning work
of Mark Stadtherr et al in pointing out errors in widely used tables
listing molecular properties.  Thus, "what's under the hood" may matter,
but the users may not know it, due to lack of knowledge.  In such cases,
user-opinion alone should not be the determining factor for code acceptance,
but the users should be further educated.

Please explain the logic of this.  Is the reason not to use Sun equipment
something to do with avoiding legal problems, is it to "boycott" someone
who does bad practices, or is there some other reason?

Certainly, Sun began as a company to supply the scientific
and engineering community, and continued
to do so as Microsoft and Intel emerged in the popular market.  My 
perception is that Sun has moved away from that as its primary 
business pursuit in recent years.  The question now is "Is there a
company today whose primary mission is to supply academic and
scientific interests?"
