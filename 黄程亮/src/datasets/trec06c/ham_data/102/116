Hi everyone!

I’m trying to use DMDX to run an experiment about priming and image 
categorization. My problem is that I need to show on screen two bitmap 
files of 5 Kb each, titillating at 32 ms. (1 tic one of them, 1 tic the 
other, and so on)

I guess that the loading time of a picture every 16 ms would decrease 
the real frequency. How could I get the right frequency or at least one 
as close as possible?

Thanks.

Pablo.
