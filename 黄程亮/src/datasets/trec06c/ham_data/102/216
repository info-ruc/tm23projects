Hi all,
	I'm not a very regular DMDX user so I'm not sure I have this correct.  I 
would appreciate it if some kind person more experienced would like to 
assure me I have it right or tell me I have it wrong.

I am setting up an experiment that has the subject respond to a left or 
right arrow on a black background.  The subject presses "A" if the arrow 
points to the left, "K" if the arrow points to the right and does nothing 
if they see anything else.

The display time is approximately 50ms
The response is accepted for 500ms
The inter stimulus interval varies between 750 and 1500 ms

I'm using an 800X600 display, JPG graphics (I know BMP would probably be 
faster) with about 100ms delay after each item to allow time to load the 
next image.  I have feedback on but will probably turn it off with a <nfb> 
in the header for the final version.  TimeDX says I have a 11.773ms refresh 
interval on the current machine.  The second blank part of each item is to 
give the correct (and varied) ISI of 75-1500ms.

! ISI : 594 + blank, require 750 - 1500ms
! shortest 594 + 14 tick = 759ms
! longest 594 + 76 = 1488ms

--and on for 50 items--

If I have this completely wrong please say, I not sure I have the 'concept' 
of a DMDX trial right.  As the display time is so short I'm worried a small 
error could through things off and I'd never know.  After reading the help 
"Timing notes" and some web pages I'm actually less sure I have it right.

Thanks in advance
Peter
