checks, please have your MIT Identification Card ready and refer to 
the checks as follows:

Chandler Hatton, Harvey Jones, David Pitman

If you need to send someone else in your/their place to pick up the 
checks or want them mailed to you, please email funds@mit.edu ahead 
of time in order to receive approval from funds.
