Dear Jonathan,
         I suspect this is a mistake I have been making often.  I have a 
habit of starting with a short attention message and normally dont put 
comments in the middle of a file (unless commenting out lines) so I suspect 
I have just not noticed.  I'll now get it right!

I still think that a semicolon on the end of a comment seems a bit 
redundant but its your software so if that is the way you want it then that 
is how I'll use it.

Thanks again
Peter
