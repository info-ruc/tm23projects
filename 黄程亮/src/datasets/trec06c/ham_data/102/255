Dear Friends, 

I realize that it is a very short notice, but I think it will be a very good 
idea to organize a special session on the relation between fuzzy, interval, and 
probability approaches - and on joint applications of these techniques, along 
the lines of the special issues of Reliable Computing and Fuzzy Sets and 
Systems and special sessions at fuzzy conferences organized and sponsored by 
Weldon Lodwick, Dan Berleant, Scott Starks, and many others. 

A lot of researchers are working in these areas, as most of you know Arnold 
Neumaier published a fundamental paper in FSS, a lot of the relation has been 
covered in NSF meeting on interval techniques in engineering organized by Fafi 
Muhanna and Robert Mullen. There are many interesting applications to 
engineering, including control, to geoinformatics, bioinformatics and other 
areas. 

Quite a lot of related papers were presented at a recent FUZZ-IEEE'05 
conference in Reno, Nevada, where several special sessions were devoted to 
interval-related topics - several, on interval-valued fuzzy sets organized by 
Jerry Mendel (chair of IEEE Technical Committee on Fuzzy) and Bob John, one of 
the main organizers of FUZZ-IEEE'06 in London, UK. 

Interesting new interval-related algorithms were presented in a FUZZ-IEEE'05 
paper by D. Dubois and others. 

Dr. Masoud Nikravesh, the main organizer of this Berkeley meeting, has 
encouraged us interval folks, at FUZZ-IEEE, to participate in FLINT'05. 

This is one more good opportunity to make our interval methods even better 
known to fuzzy community - in a celebratory conference in honor of 40th 
anniversary of the publication of the 1st fuzzy paper, a conference that will 
attract a lot of top researchers and top application folks. 

To make this special interval session possible, we need, by June 10, 2005, to 
send a list of potential authors and topics (see details below). 

Please send me the info ASAP if you are interested in coming. 

Vladik

CALL FOR PAPERS

The 2005 BISC International Special Event-FLINT05 "FORGING THE FRONTIERS"
will be held in the University of California, Berkeley, from 
November 3 - 5, 2005. UC Berkeley, WHERE FUZZY LOGIC BEGAN, is
a preeminent research institution in the proximity of Silicon
Valley. The successful applications of fuzzy logic and its
rapid growth suggest that the impact of fuzzy logic will be felt
increasingly in coming years. Fuzzy logic is likely to play an especially
important role in science and engineering, but eventually its influence may
extend much farther. In many ways, fuzzy logic represents a significant
paradigm shift in the aims of computing - a shift which reflects the fact
that the human mind, unlike present day computers, possesses a remarkable
ability to store and process information which is pervasively
imprecise, uncertain and lacking in categoricity.

The BISC Program invites pioneers, the most prominent contributors,
researchers, and executives from around the world who are interested
in forging the frontiers by the use of fuzzy logic and soft computing
methods to create the information backbone for global
enterprises. This special event will provide a unique and excellent
opportunity for the academic, industry leaders and corporate
communities to address new challenges, share solutions, and discuss
research directions for the future with enormous potential for the
future of the Global Economy.

Technical topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
 
  Soft Computing Techniques/Methodologies/Tools
  Fuzzy Sets
  Fuzzy Logic
  Knowledge Management/Discovery
  Data Mining 
  Clustering 
  Hybrid System 
  Fuzzy-EC-Based

CALL FOR INVITED SESSIONS

The goal of the invited sessions is to provide focused 
discussion on a new topic, or innovative applications of
a new approach. Proposals for invited sessions should be submitted 
by June 10, 2005 to the Program Chair. Each invited session consists 
of three-four papers, which will be reviewed through the normal
process. The proposal should be submitted by the
session organizer, and include a brief statement of the focus of the paper,
short bio of authors (including title of 3-5 refereed papers)
along with authors and titles of each paper submitted electronically.

CALL FOR TUTORIALS

Requirements for Proposals: Proposals for tutorials that address the
technical topics related to the workshop theme are welcome. We encourage
programs that will attract industrial members, and programs with high
anticipated level of interest, impact, creativity.

Tutorial Proposals must follow the format below and be submitted 
via email to: flint-cibi@eecs.berkeley.edu by June 10, 2005.
Please email only ASCII text, MS-word or Postscript files. 

Proposal Format:
 1. Title
 2. Abstract/List of Topics (< 1000 words, indicate full or half day
    tutorial) 
 3. Speakers (complete address, phone, and email. short Bio including title
    of 3-5 refereed papers)
 4. Motivation and Objectives (< 300 words)
 5. Primary/Secondary Audience

All reviews and interactions will be conducted via email. Organizers
agree to collect written course notes from all speakers no later than
Sept. 1, 2005.

EXHIBITION

There will be an exhibition site at the workshop. Reservations for
space and further information may be obtained by contacting Local
Chairs.
