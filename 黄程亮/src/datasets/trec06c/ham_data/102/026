Dear John, Bill and all:

I trust that people at Sun will take these concerns seriously, and for =
the=20
good of all, including Sun, make the necessary changes. People have been =

writing and distributing computer programs using interval operations and =

interval algorithms for more than 40 years DIFEQ integration routine - =
user's manual,=20
and will continue to do so.

In order "for interval R & D to progress as fast as possible", it is=20
necessary that Sun dispel even the perception of a threat to take any =
legal=20
action against anyone engaged in interval R&D including developing and=20
distributing interval software.
