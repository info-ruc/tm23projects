Hi all, 

I'm trying to run an auditory experiment where the listener is 
repeatedly presented with a 5 s wav file until he/she enters a number, 
after 
which DMDX is supposed to branch onto the next item. The wav file has 
to 
be repeated in such a way that there are no gaps between successive 
presentations and the listener gets the impression of a continuous 
auditory stimulus.

My problem is that when i use a multi-way branch keyword and a counter 
to loop through the wav file until a response is input, the 
repetitions 
of the audio file are not heard as continous:

n4 g1 <azk> <nfb> <d -1> <t 5000> <vm 1400, 1050, 1050, 32, 0> <id 
keyboard> <zil> <zek> <ztr> <zor> <vzk +4> <vzk +5> <vzk +6> <vzk +7> 
<vzk +8> <wfbo [0]> <dbc 255255255> <dwc 0> 

0 " item 1: how many sounds can you hear?" <set c1 = 40>;
+10 <umpr> <mpr +4> <mpr +5> <mpr +6> <mpr +7> <mpr +8> * 
<wav> “file1” 
<dec 1> <mwb +4, 30, +5, 30, +6, 30, +7, 30, +8, 30, binr 20> c; 
20 <bicGT 1,0,-10> <c>;
30 “next item”;
0 " item 2: how many sounds can you hear?" <set c1 = 40>;
+11 <umpr> <mpr +4> <mpr +5> <mpr +6> <mpr +7> <mpr +8> * 
<wav> “file2” 
<dec 1> <mwb +4, 31, +5, 31, +6, 31, +7, 31, +8, 31, binr 21> c; 
21 <bicGT 1,0,-11> <c>;
31 “next item”;
0 “End”;

Then I considered using the "again" keyword, but i can't figure out 
how 
one would stop the repetitions when a response is input and move onto 
the next item. 

0 “item1: how many sounds can you hear?”;
+10 <umpr> <mpr +4> <mpr +5> <mpr +6> <mpr +7> <mpr +8> <mwb +4, 30, 
+5, 30, +6, 30, +7, 30, +8, 30> * <wav> “file1” <an 40,296>/; 
30 “next item”;
0 “item2: how many sounds can you hear?”;
+11 <umpr> <mpr +4> <mpr +5> <mpr +6> <mpr +7> <mpr +8> <mwb +4, 31, 
+5, 31, +6, 31, +7, 31, +8, 31> * <wav> “file2” <an 40,296>/; 
31 “next item”;
0 “End”;

Any ideas on how i could do this?

Thanks in advance
