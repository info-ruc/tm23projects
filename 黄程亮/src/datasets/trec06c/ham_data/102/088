   Another thing about monitor refresh rates is that there's a check box on 
some machines (maybe all) that tells the machine to hide the video modes 
that it thinks the monitor can't handle.  While this is fine and dandy if 
the machine really recognizes the monitor a lot of the time XP recognizes 
monitors as Plug and Play Monitor, which means it doesn't recognize it at 
all.  Either install the software that came with the monitor or uncheck 
that check box and perhaps new faster video modes will become available to 
DMDX.  It's usually in the Control Panel / Display / Settings / Advanced / 
Monitor tab.  If it's not there it's possible you need to get better video 
drivers for the video card.

Kids have *never* taken guidance from their parents.  If you could
travel back in time and observe the original primate family in the
original tree, you would see the primate parents yelling at the primate
teenager for sitting around and sulking all day instead of hunting for
grubs and berries like dad primate.  Then you'd see the primate
teenager stomp up to his branch and slam the leaves.
