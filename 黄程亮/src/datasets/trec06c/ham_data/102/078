Hello!

I wish to run a masked priming experiment with DMDX. My prime durations 
are extremely brief (14, 24 and 34 ms) and it was recommended to me that 
I set my screen refresh rate very high to avoid much variability in the 
presentation of my primes. I also need this resolution because I will be 
running an eye-tracking study with the same stimuli and prime durations. 
I need both experimentations to be compatible. I have a couple of 
interrogations:

(1) The video mode in DMDX can be set at 85 Hz maximum and I am 
wondering what setting I should use since my monitor is set at 160hz.

I have already tried the help files and I have read a thread on this in 
the mailinig list but I didn't really understand. I am very new at 
dealing with hardware and timing issues. If someone could provide me 
info in laymen terms, I would appreciate. I have updated the pilots of 
my monitor (ViewSonic P95f+) and of my graphic card (Radeon 7500).

(2) Also, when I run the millisecond timer test in the basic tests 
section, it gives me a value of -0.00 ms for the refresh rate! Somehow, 
I think that is now quite what it should be.

Thank you,

Nathalie
