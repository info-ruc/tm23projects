But what about such basic operations like:

6,842,764
Minimum and maximum operations to facilitate interval multiplication
and/or interval division

6,779,006
Performing dependent subtraction on arithmetic intervals within
a computer system

6,751,638
Min and max operations for multiplication and/or division under the 
simple interval system

With them patented, most interval progams will have to infringe
the patents when trying to do elementary interval arithmetic...
Or am I missing something?
