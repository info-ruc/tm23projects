Hi,

I'm trying to install DmDX on two machines and I am experiencing
problems on both with setting the video timing parameters.

I keep getting 'certain errors' and many time out's and multiple
time out's. I tried a shorter sleep time, or a smaller value for the
'maximum lines to blit' field, but nothing helps.
The 'tachistoscopic acid test' also fails most of the times on
both machines.

The reported actual sleep time are often double the requested
sleep times, and many are longer that the refresh time. But some
are reported to be 0.0 ms!
Setting the priority for the vertical retrace thread to 'time critical'
doesn't help.

One machine runs Windows 2000 and the other Windows XP,
both patched to the most recent version. Both have DirectX 9.0.
The XP one has a NVidia GeForce MX2 video card with the
lastest driver, the Win2000 machine has a Radeon 7500 video
card. Both have a Keithley PIO card and the latest version of
DmDX installed.

The strangest thing is that the WinXP machine used to have Win98
installed and ran DmDx with that without any problem at all!
So, I am pretty sure it is not the hardware.

Does anyone know what might be going wrong?
What could I try to find out what is going on here?

I did close all other applications, by the way, even stopped the virus
scanner.

Thanks,

Maarten
