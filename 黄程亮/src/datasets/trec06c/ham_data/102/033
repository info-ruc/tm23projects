Help.

TIMEDX (v 3.1.06) keeps displaying the following message "failed to find
100 cycles without a missed retrace after 5000 cycles", when I try to
set the Time Video Mode. 

System: Pentium 4 2.66 Ghz, ATI Radeon 9000 card, 512 MB memory, monitor
Philips 107 t4

Is this just one of those configurations that do not work, or am I doing
something wrong. I have had DMDX working on a few computers now, except
this one.
