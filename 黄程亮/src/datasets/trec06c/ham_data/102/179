   Don't think that can be done, there's code in there that specifically 
waits till any audio is done playing before proceeding to the next item.

   Gaps between items are part of DMDX, I doubt there's a solution.  Doubly 
so if you are gathering input.

   That would be impressive if it worked but I certainly didn't have audio 
in mind when <aw> was designed because audio capabilities didn't exist 
then.  And I'm pretty sure I didn't think of <aw> when I added the audio 
capabilities.


>Any ideas on how i could do this?

   If you can get DMDX to loop with your audio appearing to be continuous 
then you're halfway there.   The only thing I can see that might facilitate 
this would be using <MediaLife> on you audio frames so DMDX never reads the 
file beyond it's first occurence.
