Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for yout help.

The problem is that the XP machine is one of our lab machines, and I was
testing it to see if we could move to XP with all our (about 20) lab machines.

So, the hardware cannot be changed.

Anyway, strangely enough the problem happens on both the XP machine
as well as on my own desktop machine, which has completely different
hardware and runs Win2000.
