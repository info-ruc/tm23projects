Dear all,

at Imperial College, we are at the moment in the process of building
a tool for validated integration of ODEs, where the vector field
that defines the equation is not smooth (but still Lipschitz).
Examples of such equations occur e.g. in control theory. Our hope is
to improve on existing techniques by using generalised gradients. 

Of course, we are very interested in other packages / tools to
compare our approach to. 

I'd be very grateful for any references to methods, and in particular
to implemented package, that handle validated ODE integration for
non-smooth vector fields.

Best,

Dirk.
