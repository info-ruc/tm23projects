Overview

   Various Oracle products and components are affected by multiple
   vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include
   unauthenticated, remote code execution, information disclosure, and
   denial of service.


I. Description

   Oracle released a Critical Patch Update in April that addresses
   more than seventy vulnerabilities in different Oracle products and
   components. The Critical Patch Update provides information about
   which components are affected, what access and authorization are
   required, and how data confidentiality, integrity, and availability
   may be impacted.

   US-CERT strongly recommends that sites running Oracle review the
   Critical Patch Update, apply patches, and take other mitigating
   action as appropriate.

   Oracle HTTP Server is based on the Apache HTTP Server. According to
   Oracle, the Critical Patch Update addresses a number of previously
   disclosed Apache vulnerabilities. Oracle Database Client-only
   installations are not affected.

   US-CERT is tracking all of these issues under VU#948486. As further
   information becomes available, we will publish individual
   Vulnerability Notes.


II. Impact

   The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary depending on product or
   component and configuration. Potential consequences include remote
   execution of arbitrary code or commands, information disclosure,
   and denial of service. An attacker who compromises an Oracle
   database may be able to gain access to sensitive information.


III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle
   Critical Patch Update - April 2005. The update notes that some
   Oracle patches are cumulative while others are not:

     The Oracle Database Server, Enterprise Manager, and the Oracle
     Application Server patches for this Critical Patch Update are
     cumulative, and contain all the fixes from the previous Critical
     Patch Update.
     ...

     E-Business Suite patches are not cumulative, so E-Business Suite
     customers should refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to
     identify previous fixes they wish to apply.

     Oracle Collaboration Suite patches are not cumulative, so Oracle
     Collaboration Suite customers should refer to previous Critical
     Patch Updates to identify previous fixes they wish to apply.

Workarounds

   It may be possible to mitigate some vulnerabilities by disabling or
   removing unnecessary components and restricting network access.
   Revoking PUBLIC EXECUTE privileges from vulnerable stored
   procedures may reduce the impact of SQL injection vulnerabilities
   (VU#982109).  For more specific workarounds please see the
   individual Vulnerability Notes.

   Oracle Critical Patch Update - April 2005 contains a workaround for a
   vulnerability in PeopleSoft.
