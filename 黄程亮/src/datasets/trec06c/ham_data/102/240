Dear colleagues,

Few weeks ago, Vladik Kreinovich announced two interval-related tracks, 
  identified as RCA and MCMS, at next 2006 ACM Symposium on Applied 
Computing (Dijon, France, April 23-27, 2006).
We complete his email with the CFP and the URL for the latter.

* RCA: Reliable Computations and their Applications, with an emphasis on 
combining interval and constraint satisfaction techniques.
(organized by Martine Ceberio, Vladik Kreinovich and Michel Rueher
http://www.cs.utep.edu/mceberio/Research/Conferences/RCA06/

* MCMS: More Accurate Computations: Methods and Software, with a focus 
on today's and tomorrow's methods and software that go father than the 
precision currently available on our computers
(organized by Philippe Langlois and Siegfried M. Rump).

All information is available at:
http://webdali.univ-perp.fr/mcms

MCMS Important Due Dates:
* September 1, 2005: Abstract due
* September 3, 2005: Paper submissions
* October 15, 2005: Author notification
* November 5, 2005: Camera-Ready copy

Ph. Langlois and S.M. Rump
