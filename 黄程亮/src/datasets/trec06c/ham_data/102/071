   You would have to sponsor the additions to DMDX that would allow it to 
send data out the serial port.  With said modifications done you wouldn't 
have to buy a PIO card, but the modifications to DMDX are going to cost you 
more than a PIO card will.

sure you are removing a weed and not a valuable plant is to pull
on it. If it comes out of the ground easily, it is a valuable
plant.
