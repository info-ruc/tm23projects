Hi,

I tried some of your suggestions, but as you expected, i was not able 
to eliminate the gaps between successive presentations of the wav 
files. I think my problem might be solved if there was a looping 
modifier for wav files and a keyword that cancelled this whenever the 
listner responds.   

Thanks,
Ranmalee
