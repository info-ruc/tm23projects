   Your monitor might be capable of running at 160Hz but it isn't set at 
160Hz, it will run at any speed up to 160Hz.  DMDX simply reflects what the 
operating system says the display can handle, if it's not what you want you 
can try new video drivers and if that doesn't work you'll probably have to 
get a new video card.

   My guess based on my experience with Radeon 7500 is that it isn't 
capable of providing a display at 160Hz.

   You can try checking the "Read Between Flips to stop Cheating Video 
Drivers".  If that doesn't get it it sounds like you're a prime candidate 
for new video drivers from ati.com.

sure you are removing a weed and not a valuable plant is to pull
on it. If it comes out of the ground easily, it is a valuable
plant.
