Hello,
I need to send an electrical signal from one pc to another (the latter with an input EEG card), for ERP experiment using a DMDX program.

In the past (when i didn´t know DMDX), i used the parallel port as an ouput device with an Qbasic instruction. I ´have read that it is not possible with DMDX, and that a parallel interface card (PIO card), is neccesary to sen output signals. Is it truth? Is it necesary to only send an electric change each time that an event happens?

In that case, which is the PIO card recomended to a desktop-pc Pentium IV (Window XP)?

Thank´s you in advance
