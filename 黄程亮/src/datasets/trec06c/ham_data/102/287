   Oh.  Well as a diagnostic measure it still might tell you something.

   Basically what's happening is that the machine has something else that 
needs to be done by some super critical process -- which is usually a 
device driver and in my experience it's almost always been the video 
driver.  You don't notice it normally because you're not trying to track 
the retrace but when DMDX tries to actually tell what's happening in the 
hardware it blows a bunch of assumptions out of the water that novice 
driver writers make.  I've rarely been able to track what makes one machine 
terrible and another good but usually if one tries enough new drivers the 
problem goes away.  Beyond video card and sound card drivers a really good 
candidate is chipset drivers.  If the machines have VIA chipsets in them a 
new set of Hyperion (or whatever they're calling them these days) drivers 
can make all the difference (particularly the AGP miniport and it's settings).
