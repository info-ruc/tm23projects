Dear John and all,

THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

I feel certain that it was never the intention of people at Sun Microsystems 
to stifle research and development of interval methods of computing. I 
understand that Sun is a business, however the methods of computing with 
interval numbers go back at least to my own early work while at Lockheed 
during the late 1950's and early 1960's. Since that time there has been free 
and open exchange of ideas in many publications and at many international 
meetings and through personal contacts, just as it always is, or should be, 
in basic science. Commercial applications come later. None of the patent 
applications referred to in the correspondence below are involve commercial 
applications. Rather they are only particular instances of ways of 
programming basic interval computational operations or techniques. It should 
be made CLEAR to the many hundreds of concerned researchers that they should 
relax about fears of their work being put in jeopardy by Sun lawyers.

It makes no more sense to cause such fears than it would have back during 
the introduction of the calculus by Newton and Leibnitz. I recall there was 
some sort of rivalry about that, but fortunately the lawyers of that distant 
day did not prevent the evolution of ideas and techniques which led to the 
many spectacular benefits to all of mankind from applications of the 
techniques of the calculus. Of course businesses also benefitted. Businesses 
are part of mankind.
It is one of the many things they do.

Let us sort all this out ASAP.

best wishes to ALL,

Ramon Moore
