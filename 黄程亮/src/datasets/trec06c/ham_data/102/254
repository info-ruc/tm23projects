If you know anyone who is interested in organizing a special session
at InTech'05, could you please ask them to send me a proposal asap (the
due date is the 6th June), so we have time to both evaluate it and, if
accepted, put their information on our InTech's web.

Regards,
Jirapun

Sixth International Conference on Intelligent Technologies InTech'05

Call for Special Session Proposals 

The InTech 05 Organizing Committee invites proposals for special
sessions to be held during the conference.

Each special session proposal should be well focused and
motivated. It should consist of a list of four to six papers. Each
paper in the list must have a title, names of authors with e-mails/Web
sites, and an abstract. The special session organizer's contact
information should also be included. 

All special session organizers must obtain firm commitments from their
special session presenters and authors to submit papers in a timely
fashion and, of course, to present them at InTech 05 (if the special
session is accepted). 

The special session organizers will be responsible for the quality of the
special session papers. They are expected to obtain three reviews for
each paper and make recommendations on the papers to the program
chairs based on the review reports. All accepted papers will be
published in the InTech 05 Proceedings. 

Authors who planned papers for
special sessions which were not accepted can submit their papers as
regular submissions. 

NOTE: For the special sessions, restrictions on
the number of pages will be the same as those for regular
sessions. 

Proposals should be submitted in ELECTRONIC FORM to: 

  Jirapun Daengdej (jirapun@scitech.au.edu)
