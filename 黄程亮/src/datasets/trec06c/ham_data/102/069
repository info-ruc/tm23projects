Subject: [DMDX] using serial port for EEG?

Dear DMDX,
we are looking to use DMDX for experiments with EEG. 
E-prime had been previously used in the lab for some
of these experiments, but the timing seems to be an
issue now.  We want to try DMDX, but my concern is
that in DMDX help files it says "nor does it use
serial ports (although it could)".  Serial ports have
been what we have used to send triggers to E-probe,
which is set to accept these triggers.  How can a
serial port be used to send triggers with DMDX?  Would
you use the <o N1> command in the header line?  Can we
avoid buying a PIO card?
Thank you for any help.
