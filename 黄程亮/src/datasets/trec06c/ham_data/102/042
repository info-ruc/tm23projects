That is not sufficient. The two prime US government funding agencies do not by
default allow work funded under their grants to be put in the public domain.
Rather, they usually license it for free to other government agencies,
academe, and other non-profit organizations, but not to entities that do not
make their products freely available themselves.

> Concern is not “just” among the interval folks.

Surely not; for one, the patent applications also cover most of automatic
differentiation. Also, of the more than 1000 licensed COSY users are not core
intervallers; they only want the code to work, and don't care much what it
uses inside. Those who already know about SUN's attempts overwhelmingly feel
deeply concerned, and the funding agencies urged us to inform all of them.
Worse yet, there is even movement to explicitly not make COSY available for
SUN platforms because of these problems.

I believe it is not an exaggeration to believe that to the COSY users, running
the code is more important than what machine it runs on. Earlier informal
estimates showed nearly 50% of them running on SUN, much to that company's
credit. Now this number may be lower, but whatever it is, this alone may
translate into several hundreds of lost high-end machine sales when upgrade
time comes. Likely more since the really high-end systems are often shared,
and if one user speaks up against a particular bidder, then that one is
eliminated.

As SUN is surely aware, much of its success with scientific researchers lies
in a perceived no-nonsense approach, the fact that SUN is viewed as "from
researchers for researchers", and that they are not just another IBM and
Microsoft. These patent issues have the power to torpedo this trust in SUN, at
least in a fraction of the scientific community in nuclear and particle
physics labs - and that cannot be in the interest of anybody.
