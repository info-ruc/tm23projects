   I think the easiest and cleanest way to do the background audio is to 
have it start when the item is parsed that contains the definition (before 
the item's display) and similarly have it stop when the item that contains 
a blank background audio specification is similarly parsed.  This will be 
it's use here where people have simply wanted some background noise to be 
continually present.  Integrating an indefinite length audio segment into 
the regular DMDX queue of frames so that it's beginning and ending can be 
rigorously controlled in a timewise fashion is fraught with peril and I'm 
pretty sure is unnecessary.  It would be similar to the <DVOXBeepSpec> in 
that it would not affect the item's timing or display in any way.
