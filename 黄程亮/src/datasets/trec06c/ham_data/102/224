   It would be cancelled by a keyword you'd include in the item after the 
response is given, whether that gives feedback as well is up to you but I 
try and make any functionality I build into DMDX as general purpose as 
possible so it's highly unlikely that I'd make an audio command cancelled 
by a response.

   I've looked at the code and of course it's more complicated than it 
might otherwise be but I'm fairly sure I'll be doing it sometime soon.
