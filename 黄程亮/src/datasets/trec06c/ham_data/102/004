Intervalers,

Update on Sun's patent applications:  Several of the applications have been
issued as patents, including two dealing with term consistency - constraint
propagation.

Some believe that much of this work belongs to the prior art, in patent
language.  That is, it was done more than one year before the patent
applications were filed.  In many cases, the work may have been done
previously by many members of this community.  According to my best
understanding, as individuals, probably our most effective strategy is:

For pending applications, do nothing.  Why is a longer letter than I want to
write this morning.

For issued patents, anyone can send a report to the Office of Patents and
Trademarks outlining prior art, that is, material (especially published or
commercial product, e.g., ILOG's Numerica) in which the work claimed in the
patents had appeared more than one year before the patent application.  Your
report has no direct effect, but it goes into the patent file.  If someone
sues Sun, or if Sun sues anyone, both parties will have the benefit of your
research to help make their cases.

According to a recent masters thesis by attorney Jill Gilbert, proposals for
reform of the patent process have been advanced by the US Patent and
Trademark Office, the Federal Trade Commission, and the National Research
Council.  You might consider informing yourself and lobbying for
Congressional action.
