                   ----------- CALL FOR PAPERS ----------
                  Please distribute and accept our apologies
                      if you receive multiple copies.


                              REAL NUMBERS

                    Special issue of the journal

             Theoretical Informatics and Applications
        http://www.edpsciences.org/journal/index.cfm?edpsname=ita

Guest editors: Vasco Brattka, Christiane Frougny, Norbert Mueller


IMPORTANT DATES (tentative planning):
  - Deadline for submissions of manuscripts:        June 15th 2005
    (full papers only; extended abstracts will be rejected)
  - Notification of acceptance/rejection:           October 1st 2005
  - Deadline for reception of final papers:         December 15th 2005


Efficient  manipulation  of  real  numbers  in computers  is  still  a
challenge.  Many interesting  theoretical and algorithmic problems are
linked with  that topic and belong  to quite distant  fields such as
computer science, number  theory, numerical analysis, computer algebra
and  logics.  Several special  issues on  real numbers  and
computers have been previously published in the journal Theoretical
Computer Science, as follow-up  to the  RNC meetings  on these  topics.

The last meeting was RNC6 which took place in Dagstuhl, Germany,
in November 2004, see
         http://cca-net.de/rnc6/

However, this call for papers is open to authors who did not attend RNC6.


TOPICS
Scientists working  on questions  related to real  computer arithmetic
are encouraged  to present the  theoretical or algorithmic  aspects of
their results, even if they did not attend the RNC6 conference. Survey
and  tutorial  articles  may  be  suitable if  clearly  identified  as
such. Topics include (but are not restricted to) the following list:

   * Foundation and properties of number systems
   * Computability and complexity
   * Formal aspects and automatic proof checking
   * Links with number theory and automata theory
   * Basic arithmetic operations
   * Implementation of the standard and special functions
   * Engineering of floating and fixed point algorithms
   * Symbolic manipulation of numbers
   * Accuracy and reliability for applications and industry
   * Robust geometric algorithms and exact geometric computation
   * Hardware design support and implementations


HOW TO SUBMIT
The  submission  should  contain  a  scholarly  exposition  of  ideas,
techniques, and  results, including motivation and  a clear comparison
with related work.
Submissions  must   not  substantially   duplicate  work
published or submitted for publication elsewhere.

Prepare a  PostScript or  PDF version of  your full 10-20  pages paper
preferably using the latex style
LaTeX2e class for RAIRO -Theoretical Informatics and Applications
ftp://ftp.edpsciences.org/pub/ita/.

The file should be sent  by e-mail  to Christiane.Frougny@liafa.jussieu.fr
before June 15th 2005.
Make  sure that  your  PostScript or  PDF  file can  be  printed on  a
standard  laser printer.
Language: English.
