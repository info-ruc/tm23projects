This statement is absolutely meaningless, regardless of Bill's apparent
good will.  It carries absolutely no legal weight and certainly will
NOT allay anybody's fears. In particular it will not allay the fears of
those lawyers who dictate to us what we should and should not do, and
who we should or should not collaborate with, and it will certainly
carry zero weight in court should Sun, at some future date, decide
to sue those infringing on its spuriously granted patents.

What WOULD be meaningful would be for Sun to do the following with
its patents that pertain to prior art: to release those currently
owned patents to the public domain, and to either drop its current
applications or publicly announce that intends to release said
patents to the public domain upon having them granted.

Bill's statement does NOTHING to change the fact that, as Ray
previously stated, this situation is completely unacceptable, and
Bill's apparently well-meaning statement is, unfortunately, entirely
vacuous.

And of course, you can bet your buns that Sun is completely out of the
running to supply the cluster of computers that I intend to buy in the
near future.  And I will vehemently attempt to disuade any of my
co-workers from buying Suns as well, until this mess is cleared up.

It is quite possible that the only measure that will convince Sun to
pony up the patents is to convince them that it will hurt them
in the pocket book.  That is the traditional way to convince
corporations that they are doing something unpopular.  Since academia
is a substantial customer to Sun, perhaps it is time that we start
speaking up loudly and clearly to our colleagues about Sun's
actions in this regard.
