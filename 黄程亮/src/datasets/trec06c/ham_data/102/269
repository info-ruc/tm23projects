Dear Vladik;

Prof. Zadeh had lecture in NERSC (National Energy Research Scientific 
Computing Center) and had discussion with Director of Center, who in 
fact, I am working under his program and I do represent both LBNL and 
NERSC in State of California funded program which we do fund Faculties .
http://www.nersc.gov/
As some of you also know, NERSC is the largest Super computing within 
DOE that public can have access to it.
The reason for that background is that, as Valdik you have also 
recognized very well, there are so many interesting problems that supper 
computing also does not help, and they are mostly very complex and 
uncertain (variables).

Well, during the meeting that Lotfi had with our Director and we have 
also routinely, one of the top area of interest is to how to go from 
data with probability (which have information) to Interval (which no 
assumption with respect to what are the distributions) to Fuzzy and 
eventually to information that are linguistics. That has been focus of 
discussion with Prof. Zadeh and our Director in NERSC and also a group 
that I am part of it at LBNL.

In my believe and I think that would be one of the Lotfi's believes that 
this field has a tremendous potential for fuzzy community that can 
impact the Engineering field for the years to come and may need more 
attention.

I am looking forward to your contribution and have a special session in 
this field that cover, both theoretical background and application and 
road map.

Best Regards,
Masoud
