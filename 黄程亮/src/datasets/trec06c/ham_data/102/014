		   2nd CALL FOR POSTERS
		   ====================
 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation
 =============================================================
		ISSAC 2005, Beijing, P. R. China
		================================

ISSAC, the International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation,
is an annual gathering of the Symbolic Mathematical Computation community.
ISSAC 2005 is scheduled for July 24-—27, 2005 at the Key Laboratory of
Mathematics Mechanization, Chinese A cademy of Sciences, Beijing, China.

ISSAC 2005 is expected to be very well attended. More than 110 papers were
submitted for review. Planned conference activities include invited
presentations, research and survey papers, poster sessions, tutorial
courses, vendor exhibits, and software demonstrations. Proceedings, as
well as abstracts of all posters, will be distributed at the conference. 

The Poster Sessions are an ideal avenue for presenting recent research
results or reports on ongoing research projects that might not yet be
complete, but whose preliminary results are already of potential interest
to the community. Especially welcome are posters describing
implementations of algorithms, computer algebra systems, and applications
of computer algebra and symbolic computation in the domains of education,
science, and industry. 

To encourage submissions of good quality, a prize will be awarded for the
best poster presented. Posters will be reviewed by a panel for content
correctness, relevance, and style of presentation. 

Abstracts of final versions of accepted posters will be distributed at the
conference, and will appear in the Communications in Computer Algebra, a
quarterly publication of the Special Interest Group on Symbolic &
Algebraic Manipulation (SIGSAM), ACM. All accepted posters will be
archived for public download, at the website of SIGSAM.

TOPICS OF INTEREST
 
Topics of the meeting include, but are not limited to:

* Algorithmic Mathematics: Algebraic, symbolic, and symbolic-numeric
algorithms. Simplification, function manipulation, ODE/PDE solving,
summation, integration, linear algebra, number theory, group and geometric
computing. 

* Computer Science: Treatments of theoretical and practical problems in
symbolic computation. Systems, problem solving environments, user
interfaces, software, libraries, parallel and distributing computing,
programming languages for symbolic computations , concrete analysis,
benchmarking, theoretical and practical complexity of computer algebra
algorithms, automatic differentiation, code generation, mathematical data
structures and exchange protocols.

* Applications: Problem treatments using algebraic, symbolic, or
symbolic-numeric computation in an essential or novel way for engineering,
economics and finance, physical and biological sciences, computer science,
logic, mathematics, statistics, and educ ation.

SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:

Authors are invited to submit an abstract of no more than 900 words by
electronic mail to Austin Lobo at the address alobo2@washcoll.edu. 
Portable Document Format (pdf) or PostScript is preferred, but TeX or
LaTeX source, or plain text are also acceptable . 

The deadline for submission of abstracts is May 17, 2005.  
Notification of acceptance will be made by June 14, 2005.
 
The deadline for submission of the final version of the abstract, and the
LaTeX source of the final version of an accepted poster is June 28, 2005. 

INSTRUCTIONS FOR POSTER PREPARATION

Authors should prepare posters that fit the A0 size, i.e. a maximum of 33
inches (84 cm) wide by 46 inches (117 cm) high, or 46 inches (117 cm) wide
by 33 inches (84 cm) high. Posters will be pinned onto display boards at
the conference site. 

All accepted posters will be printed at the conference site in Beijing by
the organizers of ISSAC 2005, at no cost to their authors.

Authors should strive to make their posters visually appealing and
viewer-friendly. In particular, the dense typesetting typical of journal
articles should be avoided. To ensure that the posters are of high
quality, authors are advised to use poster-prepa ration tools such as
LaTeX, Xfig, and PowerPoint. 

Prospective authors are encouraged to visit the following sites for
tutorials and other information on poster preparation
