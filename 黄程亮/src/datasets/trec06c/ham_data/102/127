Good Afternoon:

Thank you for your email note regarding a special license plate.  Wisconsin
offers two types of special license plates to recognize organizations or
groups.  The first type of plate would include a donation with the
registration fees which is returned to the organization or group to whom the
plate recognize.  The second type of special plate is the Authorized Special
Group license plate which does not allow for any type of donation but does
have the name and official symbol of an organization or group.  

If you are planning to request a special plate that would include a
charitable donation associated with the registration fee such as the
Celebrate Children, Green Bay Packers, Endangered Resources or University of
Wisconsin System license plates, it would be necessary to work with a state
legislator or legislators.  If a legislator agrees to introduce the new
plate to the legislature on behalf of an individual or organization, the
request would have to be voted on and approved by both houses of the
legislature, then signed into law by the governor. 

Should the legislature approve such a plate and it is signed into law by the
governor, the cost to the individual or organization making the request
would be approximately $197,000.  This would be required to cover the costs
of the data processing necessary to issue the plates.  The total amount
would either have to be paid up-front, or the Department of Transportation
(WisDOT) would retain each donation amount made to the organization until
the $197,000 costs are satisfied.  

The Authorized Special Group plate does not have to be coordinated with the
legislature, rather an organization requesting this type of plate need only
submit an application directly to the Special Plates Unit.  To qualify for
the plate, it is important to know that the group must meet a specific
criteria (i.e., the requesting organization cannot be a political committee,
a church, a group that operates under a creed, or a group that promotes,
practices or encourages hatred or discrimination in any form).  The group
must also submit a fee of $15,500 with the application to cover data
processing costs.  However, up to $12,000 of this fee could be refunded to
the organization during the first year of issuance at a rate of $15 per
plate sold. If you would like to have application materials for the
Authorized Special Group license plate, please let us know by return email
and I will get the materials in the mail as soon as possible. 

Thank you for your inquiry.

Correspondence to this e-mail address is managed by the Special Plates Unit
staff. Please include a copy of this note when responding. Thank you.

Good morning.

Last week I sent the following message, asking for information on how to 
establish a new special license plate. About a year ago, I requested 
this same information and never received a response.  If you are not the 
folks who can answer my questions, could you provide me with the name(s) 
of those who can.

Thank you in advance,
MaryAnn Riggs

Greetings.

I am working with the Washington County Humane Society to establish a
spay/neuter license plate for the State of Wisconsin.  Are there forms
that need to be submitted?  Do I need a sponsor?  I have read the
statute (http://www.legis.state.wi.us/statutes/Stat0341.pdf), but this
doesn't seem to provide me with the "getting started" information I need.

Thanks in advance for any help you can provide.
