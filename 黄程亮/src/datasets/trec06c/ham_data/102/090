Dear colleague,

We are again delighted to kindly invite you to participate in the conference
on
scientific computing - COSCOMP 2005 - held in honor of Hans Stetter's 75th
birthday.

The conference will take place in Vienna from June 9 to June 11, 2005.


   Due to a severe shortage of hotel rooms in Vienna in June, registration
until the
   middle of May is required: Link under
http://www.anum.tuwien.ac.at/coscomp2005/


In the technical part of the conference the evolution of scientific
computing will be
dealt with in retrospect and prospect. Speakers will be Dario Bini, Roland
Bulirsch,
Rob Corless, Jack Dongarra, Keith Geddes, Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, Linda
Petzold, Rolf
Rannacher, and Gilbert Strang.

Last but not least, there will be an extensive social program: There will be
plenty
of time to talk with the other participants and to get to know the
magnificent town
of Vienna. You will enjoy the beautiful surroundings of Vienna during a
half-day
excursion. After the excursion you will spend the evening at a traditional
Heurigen,
a rustic-style wine tavern, and feast on hearty snacks washed down with a
glass of
local wine in an informal and relaxed atmosphere.

Yours sincerely,

The organizing committee (Winfried Auzinger, Gabriela Schranz-Kirlinger,
Christoph
Ueberhuber, Ewa Weinmueller).
