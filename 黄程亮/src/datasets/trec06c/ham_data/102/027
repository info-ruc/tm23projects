Thanks Ray.

This concern may be broader than just the interval community.  When I
started to tell the story to my university IP attorney, he said, =B3I'm
acquainted with the Sun problem.=B2  When I mentioned to Jorge More at Argonn=
e
an interval project I=B9m proposing, he said, =B3But the Sun efforts to patent
interval work may put a serious damper on this project.=B2 Neither of them ar=
e
intervalers.  And that=B9s just conversations in one day.

Concern is not =B3just=B2 among the interval folks.

I join Ray in urging Sun to put their interval patents into the public
domain. Then both Sun and the research community are protected.
