Dear Ken & Jonathan, 
 
The major cause of running DMDX faster on a laptop was incorrect recognition
of the external monitor in Windows XP. Windows didn't change the monitor
type from the default one (which is it's own LCD screen) to the one which
was plugged externally. However, it did allow me to choose higher refresh
rates. This mix-up was making TimeDX to give out vertical refresh interval
in ms and other parameters inconsistently with the actual refresh rate. The
solution was to manually set the type of the monitor to the external one.
Once it was done, the TimeDX was able to get correct vertical refresh time
and program ran as expected. 
 
I guess some people are using laptops with external monitors - thought would
be useful to share the experience. In order to set type of the monitor
manually, go to Display Properties-->Settings-->Advanced-->Monitor. Select
the external monitor and choose the refresh rate. In my case it is "Plug and
Play Monitor", but could be different with different monitors & different
versions of Windows. 
 
Thanks for your replies - they helped to have stringent control over stimuli
presentation timings.  
 
Thank you, 
Arman

Arman,

 

            My suspicion is that the refresh time as indicated by TimeDX is
wrong, and it's really more like 16.6 ms.  We see this every now and then -
TimeDX either fails to give any value at all, or it gives a stupid one.  If
the refresh rate is 60 Hz, then the refresh cycle can't be 16.1 ms.
Downloading and installing the latest set of drivers for the graphics card
usually solves the problem.

 

            --Ken Forster
