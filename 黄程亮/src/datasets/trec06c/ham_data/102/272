   Did you try setting TimedDX's Read Between Flips to Stop Cheating 
Drivers in the Refresh Rate test?

   There's as much relationship between a windows 98 device driver and one 
for a unix machine as there is between a 98 driver and an XP machine.  To 
wit, none.  So a machine with XP is essentially a whole new beast.  It 
might look the same to you and your software might still be working but 
there's a whole different set of underpinnings in there.
