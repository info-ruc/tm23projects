DMDX 3.1.3.0 introduces the Background Sound Keyword

<BackgroundSound [N]>
<BGSound [N]>

     The frame's definition and contents exactly parallel a Sound Frame's, 
any keyword appropriate there is appropriate here. The difference is that 
the <BackgroundSound> has no other effect other than to start playing the 
specified wave file in a looped fashion, continuously.  As far as DMDX's 
presentation is concerned the frame does not exist.

     Once a frame with this keyword has been parsed DMDX will play the 
sound continually, that is the sound will commence before the item displays 
as DMDX waits for the previous item's request.  If there is no filename 
present in a <BackgroundSound> specification the current background sound 
will be stopped.
