Hi All,

2 Questions:

Is it possible to get the median response times using Analyze?

Does anyone know of the most commonly used cut-offs for RTs that are too short,
i.e. likely to be anticipatory responses rather than true responses. I've used
250ms, but 150ms seems to be common. I was just wondering if there was a
standard procedure out there.



Thanks,


Carrie
