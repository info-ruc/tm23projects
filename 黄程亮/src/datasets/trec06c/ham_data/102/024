Dear John, Bill and all:

I trust that people at Sun will take these concerns seriously, and for the 
good of all, including Sun, make the necessary changes. People have been 
writing and distributing computer programs using interval operations and 
interval algorithms for more than 40 years DIFEQ integration routine - 
user's manual, and will continue to do so.

In order "for interval R & D to progress as fast as possible", it is 
necessary that Sun dispel even the perception of a threat to take any legal 
action against anyone engaged in interval R&D including developing and 
distributing interval software.
