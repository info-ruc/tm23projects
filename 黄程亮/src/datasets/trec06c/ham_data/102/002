Dear Friend,

May the good tides of the lord be with you.My name is David Richard, I 
worked in a bank here in the United Kingdom.(UK)I am contacting you for 
a business transaction, of a huge sum of money from A deceased client 
of mine. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude Will make 
any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything 
has been taken care of,and all will be well at the end Of the day. I 
decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction.

FACT:
I was the account officer of a foreigner named Gerald Welsh who died in
an air crash along with his wife on The 31st October 1999 in an 
Egyptian airline 990 with Other passengers on board. You can confirm 
this from The website below which was published by CNN.WEBSITE.
XXXXXXXnews.bbc.co.uk/1/world/americas/502503.stm

since his death, none of his next-of-kin are alive to Make claims for
this monies as his heir, because they all died in the same accident
himself and is wife (May Their soul rest in peace). We could not 
release the funds from his account unless someone applied for claim as 
The next-of-kin to the deceased At that period he had $14,210,045m 
(fourteen million two hundred and ten thousand dollars)in his 
account.After four to five years the money was called back to the bank 
treasury as unclaimed bill and the money shared amongst the directors 
of the bank,which has already been done by the directors mid last year.

PROPOSITION;
Due to the relationship between i and the deceased(Gerald Welsh)he told
me of a diamond business which he had to do and left me in care of the
\"CERTIFICATE OF DEPOSIT\" which he used to lodge the funds in a
security company which is to the tune of $8.4m(eightmillion four 
hundred thousand dollars).

Note:that I decided to seek for whom his/her name shall be used as the
next of kin/beneficiary to claim the funds at the security company
rather than allow The funds to lay unclaimed. It may interest you to
know that i have secured from the probate a WRIT OF MAMANDAMUS to 
locate any of the deceased beneficiaries again; no one was found. 
Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual 
business endeavor by furnishing me with the following information if 
you are interested.
1.Full name in order for me to prepare the Document in your name.

2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers For ourPersonal Contact and mutual
trust in each other.

I shall be compensating you with 20% percent of the Whole funds on 
final conclusion of this project for your assistance,while the balance 
shall be for me for investment purposes. Because I just retired.If this
proposal is Acceptable by you,please endeavor to contact me 
Immediately.Do not take undue advantage of the trust I have bestowed on 
you.I await your urgent mail.
