Hi All,

I'm running analyze and I have no 2.0 SD trimming command in my specification
file, however trimming does seem to occur as shown in my .ism files. In a
previous query, see link:
http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/thread?message=1923726 it was suggested
that trimming is done by default. I would like to have only high and low
cut-off values rather than trimming---is there anyway not to trim the data?


Here is my .spc file specifications:

discard_display_errors
low_cutoff: 250
high_cutoff: 2000


Here is a sample from my .ism file output:

SUBJECT %ERRORS    MEAN   S.D. SD/MEAN 2.0-SD MISSING CUTOFF DISPLAY
     1        2   498.9   89.6    0.18     15       0      0       0
     2        6   442.9   88.3    0.20      9       0      0       0
     3        4   490.6   81.4    0.17     13       0      0       0




Thanks,
