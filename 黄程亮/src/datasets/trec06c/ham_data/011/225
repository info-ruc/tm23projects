Subject: Serial problems

Hello,

I am trying to get my handyboard working after it has been in a box for a
long time.  It used to work flawlessly but now I am having trouble
downloading the pcode.
I did all of the checks for the serial/charger board in the assembly
instructions and it seems to be working fine (The Max232 is outputing 9.59
& -9.59) and the LED flickers appropriately.
I run the download app and the light on the serial board flickers and the
green LED on the handyboard lights (after being off for bootstrap mode) and
I get the following output from the downloader:

Please place board in download mode and press RETURN
To quit, press Q
For help, press H
Downloading 256 byte bootstrap (229 data)
................................................................
................................................................
................................................................
.....................................___________________________
Timeout on serial receive.  256 chars left to receive
Perhaps the board was not connected properly or not in download mode


I have tried everything I can think of.  I have used about a million
different phone cords.  I've tried different options for the downloader.
I've tried 2 different macs & a PC.  I used all the different downloaders I
could find.  No dice...
Does anyone have any suggestions?   I've gone over the serial board, it
seems ok.  Where should I start looking on the handyboard for problems?
Thanks,

		-Jeremy
