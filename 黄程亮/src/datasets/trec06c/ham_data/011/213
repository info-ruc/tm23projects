At the bottom of the following page are a couple links to vendors:

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/sonar.html

(This page is on the Handy Board site; hit the Software link, then
Libraries, then follow the Polaroid sonar link.)

In addition, the Robot Store in California sells 'em, but they're a rip-off
($150/pair!) so I think you're much better off getting one from Wirz
Electronics or directly from Polaroid for about $50 each.  As far as I can
tell, it's the same item.
