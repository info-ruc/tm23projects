hello!
    I pulled out my HB today and rtied playing around with the IR port. it
does not work for some reasons. I checked the remotes: they are still
transmitting!

Here are the steps I took: am I missing a step?

1. loaded sony-ir.icb
2. sony_init(1);
3. ir_data(n);

and it alwayys returns a zero ,even when Im sending remote signals. So this
means that the IR receiver on the HB is shot, right? Is there anythig else
that may be acting up?
thanks alot!
