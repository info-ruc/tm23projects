Hi
    Ive elected to use 2 relays to run a motor. Im going to put one motor on
with the power coming in 'straight' and the other one in reverse of the
first one:

    [RELAY 1]       [RELAY 2]
    ++          --         --           ++   (power is inverted)

       |--------|            |-----------|
       |          \_______           |
DIODE                      \        DIODE
       +-----------------+   \            |
                               |     \           |
HB motr port 1:    X    X-------+


Will this method work effectively by allowing only 1 relay to work at once?

One other question: What could I use in place of a diode, since the motor
ports operate at a higher voltage and amperage than most diodes are. Or how
ca I effectively reduce the power output of the HB?

Thanks alot!
phil
