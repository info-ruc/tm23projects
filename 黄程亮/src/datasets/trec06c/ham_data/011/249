I didn't actually buy the clock, the company that I work for was
scrapping a load of stuff from one of it's buildings and these clocks
were some of it. The company said if we gave 2 pounds to charity we
could have a clock. They have been very popular so there are none left.
I am hoping to make use of the compass section as a heading indicator
for a walker robot but I haven't worked out if the cpu is spi compatible
or if it uses the same commands as the V2X.

The V2X only costs 50 USD from Jameco and these clock were probably sold
for 100 - 200 GBP (166 - 333 USD) so I was just lucky.
