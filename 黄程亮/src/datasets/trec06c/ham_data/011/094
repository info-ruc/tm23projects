Mr. Conn.

Can I place my small library to the PAL ? 

I have created library which allow operates with unlimited numbers. Each
number allocates so many bits how necessary. Maxumum number is about
2**2_000_000_000, and maximum precision is about 2**-2_000_000_000 for 32
bit machine. The size of numbers is limited only by memory size. Allowed
operations is + - * / rem > < >= <= = /= Shift, Abs, or, and, xor,
To_String.  Test program which uses this library been successfuly compiled
and runs under GNAT_3-10_Win32 and under AONIX for Windows Spetial Edidtion
v 7.1.424.

I send the archive for preliminary familiarize you about it.

I have readed the 
"Detailed PAL Submission Instructions
Last Update: 26 September 1993"

Is there all instructions actual now ?
