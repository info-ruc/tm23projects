it then activate it and retrieve the data but I still get 255 when I press a
different button on my remote. I am using an all in one remote which is
compatible to the sony remotes.  I also have a pcbug11 program and don't
understand a thing about that. I need help in the next few days.thanks

The all-in-one remotes usually only send Sony-compatible signals after
setting the proper mode.  I had to refer to my owner's manual to figure out
which buttons to push to put it in Sony mode.  Make sure yours is set
properly.  Good luck.
