Dear Fred,

The Mechatronics class competition was to build autonomous miniature 
forklifts that would navigate a complex course.  In the course, the 
forklifts had to identify, pick up, and deliver three.  The path that the 
forklifts had to negotiate became increasingly difficult for each pallet 
they encountered.  They determined the ID of the pallet from a barcode 
label.  They received material handling instructions (i.e. which bay to 
take the pallet) and traffic information from a IR Tower that broadcast 
instructions from the center of the course.  They also had to negotiate a 
"factory door" that they sensed to determine if it was closed. Pictures of 
the competition can be seen at  http://www2.et.byu.edu/~eetwww/Mfet548/

The students handled the memory limitation by eliminating as many of the 
programs loaded at start up that they could and making their code as 
concise as possible.

The Handyboard is very useful and the students really enjoyed working with 
it.  However, the memory limitation was a problem for the students that did 
the best in the competition.  One of the students, Richard Abbott, asked 
the same question back in November but I didn't see any responses.  Since 
the topic of memory came up was hoping someone might be willing to share a 
solution - if there is one.

The idea to have a Mechatronics competition came from seeing your work at 
MIT, and the Handyboard greatly facilitated building the forklifts.  For 
this I want to say thank you.  It made big difference in the class.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kevin

Dear Kevin,

Please forgive this non-answering of your question, but I am curious
as to what kinds of hardware projects/software objectives were your
students working on when they ran out of 'hc11 memory, and how did
they deal with this circumstance?

Fred
