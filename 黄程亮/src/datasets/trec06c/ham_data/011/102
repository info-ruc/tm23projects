I have been using very successfully for two months now, the code in the
attached zip file. It has Interrupt Driven Transmit & Receive functions, both
are buffered.
    I found the code easy to adapt for my specific task. Messages can be
"Canned", Fixed, or variable length.
    *** I found this on the Net somewhere, but cant remember now. All rights

  The second thing I noticed in your mail was looking for ways to control Data
flow to keep your PC & HB syncronized.  There is a solution built into the
attached software as well  !!  Its commonly known as "XON / XOFF Flow
control".   If the software receives $11 in the buffer it turns ON the
transmitter , allowing data to be sent - this is XON.   Alternatively, if the
software receives $13 in the buffer it turns OFF the transmitter , stopping
data  transmission- this is XOFF. 
      A similar technique could be used at the PC end for controlling data
from the PC.

  Many Regards,

Terry Howsham
