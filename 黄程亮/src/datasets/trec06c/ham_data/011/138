Subject: Thanks Fred et al...

        My first scratch-built HamdyBoard has passed all of it's tests and
is up and running.  I've only been looking for something like this for about
twelve years, so I'm REAL happy. I especially appreciate the emphasis on
both hardware and software development in the HB program, and your continued
support of the community.  Again, thanks.

        Other notes:  BG Micro (www.bgmicro.com) has a quantity of 'A1FN
chips for 6.95 each.  These are used, and look it, but the three I bought
seem to work.
        If you're running HBDL in Windows and have trouble configuring the
register at 0x0C, try running the DL.EXE that comes with shareware IC from
the DOS prompt.
        I also have 6 extra IS1U60's available at cost plus postage if
anyone is interested.
