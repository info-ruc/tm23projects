Subject: using the MC34064 LVI
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello,

This is a warning for anyone considering using the Motorola MC34064 to replace
the DS1233. I have just built a couple handyboards and I had some problems
getting them working. I finally tracked the problem done to the LVI. I used the
MC34064 instead of the DS1233 because I had some laying around. WARNING the pin
out on the two is not the same:

Pin  DS1233  MC34064
 1    GND    *RESET
 2   *RESET    +5
 3     +5     GND

The MC34064 can be used but it must be rotated 120 degrees so that the signals
will be correct.

-- Jeff
