Everyone is complaining about the price of LEGO motors.  There is a
new product, a gear reduction motor, that is a great value.  It is a
super efficient DC motor with a built in gearbox that can be used for
direct drive, or with one stage of gear reduction.

At $24.50, it's cheaper than any gear motor but those found
sporadically on the surplus market.  Plus it's fully LEGO compatible.

It should be available now, but might still be delayed for a couple of
months.  Call PITSCO  (800) 362-4308 to get a catalog.  I don't know
the part # offhand, but it's the "9v gear reduction motor."  You might
need to get 9v connector leads as well.
