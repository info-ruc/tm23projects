Subject: Re: Lego 9V motors work well?

Hi Greg,
I have been using LEGO 9v motors for a few years and I am very pleased with
the results.  I run freshman and sophomore engineering design and computer
science courses using LEGO kits and HB's.  The motors are well worth the
price if you are integrating with LEGO.  My students have built Nerf
basketball playing robots, a successful IEEE micromouse, and very successful
Trinity fire-fighting robots (including first place in 1997) using LEGO
motors.  I used surplus DC motors in the past, but we encountered too many
problems including mounting/interfacing to LEGO, alignment, current demands,
etc.  Good luck.
