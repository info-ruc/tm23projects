Hello I=B4m a beginner. I have problems download pccode in my HB.
I=B4ve a Mac G3 and I use Init board HB 7.2 modem & 6811 Downloader.
I,ve check connections, batteries and the board is in download mode.
Bat/pwr LEDs light on (1/3 second) and turn off.
When is downloading, power LED is flickering.
The error messages are:
- Init board HB 7.2 modem "Time out"
- 6811 Downloader "sinchronizing failed"
The HB is made by Gleason research and is tested.
I,ve used the HB 3 months ago and it worked right (with another computer
, macintosh quadra).
Please tell me any solutions. Thanks
