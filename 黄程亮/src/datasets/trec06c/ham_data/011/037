Subject: Lego 9V motors work well?

What has been people's experience in using the Lego 9V motors with the
Handyboard?  I know they're overpriced, but they are easy to use...

We've used small RC car motors etc. in our Lego robot course in past years,
but some students have been looking at the Lego motors and I promised them
I'd see what I can find out.  Thanks for any help.
