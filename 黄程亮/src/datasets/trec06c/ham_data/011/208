Kay,

Thanks for sending me your project description.  As we discussed, I like
it very much.  I think you will have some very interesting results. 
Some further comments:

1. Since compression is not your major emphasis, it is ok to use
off-the-shelf codec.  Note that you can compress video into bitstreams
off-line.  For your experiments, you will then packets the bitstream and
send the packets out, in which the exact scheme/parameters will be
adaptive to the network traffic.

2. As I mentioned, I hope you will also study also the error resilience
issues at the decoder.

For the mid-term, I suggest you show a working MPEG2 video coding with
offline encoding, real-time transmission over the network, and perhaps
real-time decoding.  Good luck!

Tsuhan
