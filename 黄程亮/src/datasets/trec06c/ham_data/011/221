Hello everyone,

A few sonar questions (other than where to buy them):

1: The speed of sound has been widely quoted to be 0.9 ft/ms (274m/s),
   but my Physics text lists it as 343 m/s (at 20C/70F), which is about
   1.13 ft/ms, or 25% faster.  So why the 0.9 value (or just cuz
   the Polaroid guys say so)?

2: The sonar routines (e.g. sonar_sample()) return the distance as an
   int, meaning the greatest round-trip distance possible is 32768 
   half-microsecs, or 8192 microsecs one-way.  By my math, 8.2ms is
   about 3m (10 ft).  Is this our max distance?  Any way to improve
   this?

3: My sonar works well, but about 10% of the time it returns a spurious
   low value (around 2200 counts/8 inches), even if nothing has moved
   or changed in the environment.  I have written a kludge to simply
   re-pulse if it receives such a result, which works fine, but it's
   ugly and I'm just treating the symptom, not the cause.  Any ideas
   why this is?  (I'm using sonar_closeup(), BTW)

4: I'm confused by the guts of the sonar routines.  The start_time is
   read from the system TCNT register as a 16-bit integer (max 32768
   counts).  If TCNT increments 2,000,000 counts/sec, does this mean 
   TCNT rolls over every 16ms?  If so, it seems quite likely that the
   counter will roll over while we're waiting for a pulse to return
   depending on when we peek it for the start_time.  However, the 
   routines work fine, so can someone please clear up my 
   misunderstanding?

Cheers!  Skye.
