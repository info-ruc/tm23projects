Ive never done this before, but couldnt you do this?
    Buy a multiplexer that will take 2 outputs and multiplex it to 4
outputs, since you will only be driving one at a time. To each individual
output of the multiplex, wire the power to one outputting transducer and one
inputting transducer, and wire all of the recievers to the reciever portion
of the interface, and all the transmitters to the transmitter and of the
interface. Using the multiplexer, you are guaranteed that only one
multiplexing pair will be on at a time, uless you have a faulty chip.
Again, I have never worked with Polaroid sensors, but this does work with
motors, ETC
