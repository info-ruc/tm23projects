The Lego motors are sized such that they can be "pinned" to the frame of a
Lego robot easily.  With a horizontal beam beneath the motor and another
across the top, a pair of six-unit beams can be pinned vertically to the
horizontal beams using the Technics black pins, resulting in a bomb-proof
assembly.  My entire robot chassis is built this way, and so it's guaranteed
not to come apart unless I take it apart.  For details on the general Lego
pinned structure technique, see "The Art of LEGO Design" link at the bottom
of the Docs page on the Handy Board site.  Good luck.
