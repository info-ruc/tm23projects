Sure did.  I used a ceramic disk capacitor...  Hope that was okay to use.
I just can't find what the problem is with the ranging board.  For all I
know, it has never worked.  This is my first attempt at using it.  There
really isn't a whole lot to the board, and I am generally confused what
could be causing a short.
