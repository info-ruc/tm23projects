I am wanting to add speech to the Handy Board.  I am currently
looking at interfacing a SPO256-AL2 speech synthesizer chip and
have a very limited schematic that came with the chip many years
ago.  Does anyone have a nice set of schematics for doing this
or know where I could find some?  Also, is there a better chip
out there with the associated schematics?

  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you,
John Woolsey
