I have a question for you, how much does the compass deviate when the motors
turn on. As an ex-sailor, one of the major consideration in using magnetic
compasses is deviation, and on a small bot, the deviation would vary due to the
changing electromagnetic fields. So have you turned on the compass, and watched
to see if the reading varyied if the motors turn on and off?

Just wanted to know.
Thanks

John,
My v2x has these numbers on the cpu        6448
                     			           PN11096	 
					V2XC JJJ
I have a handyboard , a v2x compass  and small robot platform with left and
right steering motors. Everything works, I can run the motors,load
compass.icb and compass.c and the lcd will print the heading constantly
when I type  v2x( ); at the command line.
My problem is lack of knowledge programming. I would like to know if any
one has a complete program that I could run and learn from.
Just a program that I could have my robot go one direction for a certain
number fo wheel rotations or length of time then turn another direction
ect,ect,ect. I think I could make changes rotations and directions ect. if
I had a working program to start with and study.
Thanks
