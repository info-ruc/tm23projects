Hi there, I'm in the middle of building a handyboard and I'm having a lot of 
problems. 
I'm on part 7.2 (Digital Input cct) and the testdigitals(); function in hbtest.c 
doesn't respond to the start button. All the chips and RP1 are installed 
properly and none are getting hot. While testing pin1 of U5, the yellow 
Charge LED on the I/C board lights up fully. Is this supposed to happen, as 
I suspect it's not good.
I just tried it now, and even when testdigitals(); is not running, it still does 
the same thing, in fact, it stops any communication between the board and 
the computer. This is part of my final year project and I've been stuck on 
this for ages. If anyone could help, I'd really appreciate it.
Thanks,
   Rob O' Neill
