We used OEM barcode reader (IS4120-41 scanner decode engine) from 
Metrologic Instruments, Inc..
The output of this reader is the barcode ASCII format transmitted across an 
RS232 line.  We read this with the handy board's RS232 serial port.  You 
can slow down the data transmission on the barcode reader so that you do 
not have to use interrupt driven software on the handyboard's side. 
 However, in our competition seeing the barcode was frequently an 
asynchronous event and an interrupt driven approach worked the best.  They 
are only about an 1.5"x1.5"x0.5" in size and they worked great.  The 
address for the barcode reader supplier follows:

How did the board read the barcode label? What equipment/algorithm
was used?

I've been screwing around with a train, and haven't really had any
luck with reading a barcode from the track as it passes over.
