Just take a look: CHINA GOLD CORP
Symbol: CGDC
Current Price: 1.90

You can see China’s developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare opportunity for early investors!

Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? See nowadays what happened:
• Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for inflation.)

• HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.

• China is the world’s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China’s rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.

• China is already the world’s 4th largest producer of gold — and will soon be the world’s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going gold-crazy!

• Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed to provide full legal protection.

 Never stand on the tail of a hedgehog after midnight As busy as a bee There is no time like the present Boys will be boys Never play leapfrog with a unicorn  Forbidden fruits create many jams It takes all sorts to make a world Good fences make good neighbours! Big tree fall down, goat bite he leaf. When man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am. We cannot be more sensitive to pleasure without being more sensitive to pain  It is foolish to deal with a fool Think before you speak Don't count your chickens before they're hatched . A constant guest is never welcome. You catch more flies with honey than with vinegar He is always right who suspects that he makes mistakes Like flogging a dead horse Never judge someone until you have travelled a mile in their shoes He that knows nothing, doubts nothing Nah put all two foot in river if yuh want see how he deep. What does not kill you makes you stronger Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. Wise children have short years Strike while the.. bug is close. If yuh nah get wing, nah ah guh a bird sport. Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it A good mate is the road map for the spaghetti junction of life. Love is blind. Yuh can't fatten cow fuh another man butcher.	 Haste makes waste. Opportunities always look bigger going than coming

  Stock analysis tools and tips meant to increase long-term profits <BR><BR><BR> A Fool May Give a Wise Man Counsel. Great minds think alike Happiness is not a state of mind, but a manner of travelling  Good talk saves the food Your future lies before you like a field of driven snow Be careful how you tread it for every step will show Opportunity makes a thief Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings 
  Lightning never strikes twice in the same place Beer before wine is fine Wine before beer makes you feel queer! Ill-gotten gains never prosper Where there's a will, there's a way. Rats desert a sinking ship. Opportunity makes a thief The fish will soon be caught, that nibbles at every bait After the game, the king and the pawn go into the same box There is a skeleton in every cupboard  Divide and rule as delicate as a baby's eye lashes 
  Anybody can make history Only a great man can write it  as soft as velvet A huge part of real love is constant forgiveness. The country is in ruins, and there are still mountains and rivers - japanese proverb The trouble with experience is that by the time you have it, you are too old to take advantage of it What flares up fast, extinguishes soon When the student is ready, the master will appear  Folly grows without watering When distrust enters in at the foregate, love goes out at the postern  The stylus is more potent than the claymore. When one shears the sheep, the skin on the ram trembles  
  Good talk saves the food As is the gardener, so is the garden  Well done is better than well said <br>
