	Performance-wise, they are okay (i.e., they are powerful enough).
I don't like the short axle they have on them, though (compared to e.g. a
Mabuchi motor with a LEGO 2x drilled axle Super-Glued onto the motor shaft),
because gears (especially worm gears) slip off of them.  With a longer
axle, you can use a half-bushing on either side of the gear to lock it down.

	They are indeed terribly overpriced...just like the SPST switch in
a LEGO brick for $20, and the photoresistor in a LEGO brick for $26.
