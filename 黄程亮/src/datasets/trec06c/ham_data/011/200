I would recommend buying the one transducer and module for $50.  The extra
circuit that you would get with the designer's kit is totally unnecessary if
you have the Handy Board already.

You only save a few dollars by buying more than one unit, and hooking up the
second might be tricky.  You might want to try out just one at first.

One sonar unit is easy enough to connect using the instructions on the Handy
Board web site.  I'm looking into ways to connect a second unit.  I would
certainly appreciate any suggestions from others on how to do that.  I would
like to use as few input/output ports as possible, perhaps by sharing the
BINH or ECHO signals between the two (alternating between the two units as
necessary).  My biggest concern is whether the ECHO signal put out by one of
the units will harm the other unit, if the two are simply connected in
parallel to the same TIC port.  Can anyone tell me about that?  Thanks a bunch.
