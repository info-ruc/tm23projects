I'm curious how you went about securing the motors to your robots.  I
picked up a couple yesterday, and they do seem to be very good quality
motors, but just sticking them on "the LEGO way" doesn't work too
well.  They keep ripping themselves loose and falling out.  Did you
end up drilling through the bricks and using screws, or did you glue
them in place, or what?
