Hi German,

I'm not sure why this message got re-forwarded to the handyboard mailing
list.  I was cc'd on the key that our order department e-mailed to you
last week;  if you still have not received it please let me know.

We appreciate everyone's patience while we got our new credit card
system up and running with our bank.  (It's running smoothly now).
