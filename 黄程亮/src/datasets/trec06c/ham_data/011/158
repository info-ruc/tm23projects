Dear Laurent and German,

I wish to publicly apologize for Newton Lab's slowness of response to
your messages of last fall.  You should know that the employee in charge
of handling IC sales and support during that time is no longer with the
company.  Please send IC sales requests to "sales@newtonlabs.com" or
"support@newtonlabs.com" to prevent your messages going to an unread
mail spool.  (I only have one message from either of you in the last
month, and that was from German on Wednesday asking to purchase a copy
of IC 3.1).

Furthermore, as you know we have been waiting for some time to be able
to take credit cards, which makes purchasing much more convenient for
overseas customers who do not wish to go through the trouble to generate
a money order in U.S. funds.  As of yesterday we are now (finally) able
to accept credit cards for IC purchase -- our bank took a lot longer
than we were originally led to believe.  This should make overseas
purchases like your own much easier in the future.

Again, I apologize for these two problems last fall, and I invite you to
try our service again.

-- Randy
