Hello all,
            I am attempting to use the shaft encoder routines but am =
having trouble.When I try to load the file fencoder0.icb I get a message =
that ic cannot find the file.Any hints?
   Also I would like to know whether these routines count off one edge =
of a pulse or what dictates how the count is incremented.
