The Very Large Array continues to observe the full sun on Feb.24
from 15:23-23:23 UT.

RECENT ACTIVITY:
Yesterday during the VLA observing period, the selected
target filament erupted around 21:00 UT.  The eruption was well
observed in H-alpha from the SOON observatory at
Holloman New Mexico and was well observed by the imaging H-alpha
spectrograph at Mees Observatory in Hawaii.  

OBSERVATIONS on Feb 24.

SOONSPOT observatories are now (16:00 UT Feb 24) targeting
a new large filament that was located (approximately) at
S56 E53 at 23:45 UT on Feb. 23.  Limited field of view
instruments following these VLA/SOHO/YOHKOH observations
are advised to target this filament until 12:00 UT on Feb. 25.

FUTURE OBSERVATIONS:

After today, VLA observations are suspended until Feb. 28th as
indicated in earlier announcements.  Targeting information for
limited FOV instruments will be broadcast by 20:00 UT on 27 Feb.
These special low frequency observations with the VLA will
occur from 14:37 to 22:37 on Feb. 28.
