The handyboard has to stay in special test mode so that it can switch
into and out of 'single chip' mode at will. This is necessary to operate
the LCD (which uses either a clever or gross hack depending on your
taste). If you are writing code using something other than IC you can
modify the board to stay in extended chip mode (all RAM is accessible)
and then you'll need a new LCD circuit or module.
