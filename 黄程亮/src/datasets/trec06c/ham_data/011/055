I think the file is named fencdr0.icb by default (not fencoder.icb).  Maybe
it's just that simple (I hope)?  Also, it's probably easiest if it's in the
directory with all the other stuff you're loading (the lib directory).

These encoder routines seem to simply monitor the analog port and increase
the count whenever the reading drops below the low threshold or goes above
the high threshold.  The simple way to set these threshold values is to
print the value on the analog port repeatedly in a loop while spinning the
shaft around, and making a note of the low and high readings.  My
Hall-effect magnetic sensors, for example, only range between about 110 and
135, so I set the low threshold to 115 and the high to 130, and they work
great.  Your results will vary depending on the type of sensors you're using
(IR transceiver, etc.), but if you calibrate them correctly, you'll be off
by just a constant factor.

Try the slow versions of the routines first (e.g. sencdr0.icb) instead of
the fast ones, since the slow ones are more efficient.  Good luck.
