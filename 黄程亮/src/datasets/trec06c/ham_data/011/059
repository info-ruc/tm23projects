I think the file is named fencdr0.icb by default (not fencoder.icb).=20

 Maybe
it's just that simple (I hope)?  Also, it's probably easiest if it's in =
the
directory with all the other stuff you're loading (the lib directory).

These encoder routines seem to simply monitor the analog port and =
increase
the count whenever the reading drops below the low threshold or goes =
above
the high threshold.

Does this mean that if you have a very slow pulse the encoder routine =
may increment more than one time per pulse or is it triggered of only on =
a rising or falling edge?


   The simple way to set these threshold values is to
print the value on the analog port repeatedly in a loop while spinning =
the
shaft around, and making a note of the low and high readings. =20
  My
Hall-effect magnetic sensors, for example, only range between about 110 =
and
135, so I set the low threshold to 115 and the high to 130, and they =
work
great.  Your results will vary depending on the type of sensors you're =
using
(IR transceiver, etc.), but if you calibrate them correctly, you'll be =
off
by just a constant factor.

Try the slow versions of the routines first (e.g. sencdr0.icb) instead =
of
the fast ones, since the slow ones are more efficient.  Good luck.
