Subject: Expanding the memory of the handyboard

A number of students that used the handyboard in our Mechatronics 
competition needed substantially more memory than the 16,320 bytes 
currently available.  What options are there to add memory to the 
handyboard?


Thanks to everyone who contributes to handyboard@media.mit.edu

re: #1,

in a sense, the stuff you downloaded *is* there, but IC doesn't know
how to access it until you re-download.  So yes, each time you restart
IC, you must re-download your project.


re: #2.

there are not good reporting tools for memory usage.  i think the
'mem' command reports free memeory in the IC application, which isn't
that relevant.

the way that the 6811 memory is partitioned is follows, there is
basically 16K for user code.  There is no way to free up more space
without recompiling IC.   Here are some more details.


user program object code + user global variables	16320 bytes available
runtime OS						 7936 bytes used
stack space for user processes				 6656 bytes used
buffer for interaction process				  256 bytes used
buffer for printing					  256 bytes used


When downloading your code, IC tells you how many bytes are going
down.  You've got 16,320 available.
