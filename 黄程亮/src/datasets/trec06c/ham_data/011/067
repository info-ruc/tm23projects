In my experience, it doesn't matter how slow the pulse is.  The count is
increased each time the analog port value crosses outside of the middle
range defined by the two threshold values as shown below (please note that
you'll need to view this with a non-proportional font, like Courier):
          __              __
         /  \            /  \
high .../....\........../....\..........
       /:     \        /:     \
        :      \      / :      \      / 
 low ...:.......\..../..:.......\..../..
        :       :\__/   :       :\__/
        :       :       :       :
                                   time-->
count:  +       +       +       +

Of course, if you only want one count per period, you could just set one or
the other thresholds to an extreme value and the other to a mid-range value.
This allows you to count either rising or falling signals.

Good luck to you and your robot.
