SCIENTIFIC OBJECTIVES:

We plan to image coronal mass ejections and associated metric type II and
type IV radio bursts  and compare them with the SOHO/ LASCO and EIT and
ground-based observations in order to better understand solar eruptive phenomena.
The primary goals are to learn more about the relationships between  shock waves, 
flares and coronal mass ejections. We will explore the relation between thermal 
and nonthermal plasmas during the eruptions.  The radio and coronal white light 
images will both be used to determine CME masses and the results from
the two wavelength regeimes will be compared.
 
OBSERVING PLANS:

The VLA will observe at 327 and 74.5 MHz.  At these frequencies the VLA field of view 
is very large (2.25 deg at 327  MHz and 10 deg at 74.5 MHz), so the disk center is 
the target for the Very Large Array.   Instruments with limited fields of view should target
active filaments.  The SOONSPOT system of USAF telescopes will be targeting
filaments for these observations.  SOONSPOT targeting will occur by 21:00 UT
on the days prior to VLA observations.  It is our intention to broadcast those
targets to help guide limited field of view instruments.
