	Yes, this is very possible, and I've done a fair amount of work for
various experiments where I needed to get data back from the board.  First,
you should check out http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html
for the routines that the 6.270 and Handy Board that let you disable the
communication stream between IC and the board and then send your own data
over the main serial link.

There are also Richard Drushel's routines, which implement some basic
functions to send/receive data between the board and a host computer.
These routines can be found at
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/contrib
/drushel/ and have worked very well for me.

On the PC side, you'll have to either open up a terminal window to the COM
port you have the board on (9600 baud, no handshake), or write a software
program to handle the data.  I use Linux to talk to my HB, which simplifies
programming quite a bit and works very well overall for data logging,
remote control, etc.  One of my current projects is using the HB to
activate the PTT circuit on an amateur radio in an effort to set up a
remote control station.  Doing that sort of thing is very simple in Linux,
while a monster in Win95 or DOS.

Linux serial routines can be found on the Linux Documentation Project HOWTO
page or on sunsite, etc.

Hope this helps!
