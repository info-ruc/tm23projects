>Also. The Robot Builders Bonanza has a similar circuit. The price for the
parts should be under $10.00. Has anyone tried this circuit?


Yeah, it doesn't work :) That's why I designed my circuit in the first place.
I tore my hair out for a couple of weeks trying to figure out what I was
doing wrong. I finally realized it wasn't me, it was the circuits in the book
were just plain wrong. So instead of figuring out where the author messed up,
for me it was just easier to redesign the darn thing. The writeup though in
the book that goes along with the circuit seems to be pretty accurate. That
was the information I used to build my circuit.
