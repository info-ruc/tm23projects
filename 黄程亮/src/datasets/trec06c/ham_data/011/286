I am having troubles getting my ir sensor to work I did everything that is
said in the technical reference and when I try to retrieve the data all I
get is 255 the first time and 0 all the other times. I tried to deactivate
it then activate it and retrieve the data but I still get 255 when I press a
different button on my remote. I am using an all in one remote which is
compatible to the sony remotes.  I also have a pcbug11 program and don't
understand a thing about that. I need help in the next few days.thanks
