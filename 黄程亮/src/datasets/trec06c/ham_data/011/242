Yes!  I have been working from your sonar page, but as a sanity check 
I checked the Polaroid sheet again.  Whoops!  At least we were both 
tripped up by it.  I'm used to seeing the "speed of sound" (ft/ms) 
quoted, not the "slowness of sound" (ms/ft)!  

aside: Using my trusty tape measure I calculated a speed of 1.09 ft/ms 
(330 m/s) so it *is* pretty close.

Aren't IC 16-bit integers only signed, and therefore -32k to +32k?
Does it thus return times from -16ms to +16ms, 32ms total?  Or is this
somehow an unsigned integer?  I know signed/unsigned integers differ
only in the interpretation of the sign bit, but how does *IC* interpret
this 16-bit time?

True, but we aren't *initializing* the timer to zero when we send the 
pulse, are we?  It is my understanding that we only *sample* the timer 
when the pulse leaves, and then have it automatically sampled again when
it returns.  Thus subtraction yields the time-of-flight.  But (if this
is true) what happens if we send the pulse (and sample the timer) just
before it rolls over?  Then the return time is recorded *after* the
rollover and our time-of-flight is boned.  Or does it not work this
way at all?

Thanks for the prompt reply!  Cheers, Skye.
