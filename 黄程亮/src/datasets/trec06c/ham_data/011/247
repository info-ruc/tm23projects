Subject: Help for problems with Polaroid 6500 sonar board

Hi all

if anyone has problems using the 6500 series for distances below 35cm by
using the binh signal I have a possible solution to the problem. We also
expierienced problems using the sensors for distances between 15cm and
40cm. We finally found out that the digital chip (TL851) on the 6500
board gets huge voltage spikes making it detect an echo even if there
was none.
We solved the problem by adding an additional capacitior to the
powersupply.

THE REWORK
Solder a tantal c (1uF) directly to pin 3(Gnd) and pin 1 (+) of chip U2
(TL851).

This will filter the spikes keeping them from droping below 2.5 V.
If anyone has a better way of solving this problems please tell me.
