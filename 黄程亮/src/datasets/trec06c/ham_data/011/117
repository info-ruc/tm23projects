Does anyone have a temp 3 week reg code for IC 3.x that I could use??  =
Im having problems loading the frequency measuring routinues provided on =
this mailing list and I believe it might be because I'm still using IC =
2.8 and the routines have been tested and used on IC 3.x.  I dont want =
to have to put up $35 for the reg if it wont solve my problems.  Thanks. =
