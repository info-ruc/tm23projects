I notice that Adam's circuit uses all 4 available SCI outputs to select
the transducer, but the sonar board itself requires two of them already.  
Why not just get a 2-to-4 line demultiplexor, and use the remaining 2 
SCI outputs to select the transducer?  (i.e. 00,01,10,11)  If you can't
find one ('139 I believe) a demultiplexor can be easily made out of
a couple of NOT gates and a quad NAND gate (or quad AND if you need
active high outputs).

I have a question: why does Adam use open-collector NOT gates with
pull-up resistors?  Why not just use a totem-pole chip?  Any advantage?

Cheers, Skye.
