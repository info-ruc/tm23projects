John,
My v2x has these numbers on the cpu        6448
                     			           PN11096	 
					V2XC JJJ
I have a handyboard , a v2x compass  and small robot platform with left and
right steering motors. Everything works, I can run the motors,load
compass.icb and compass.c and the lcd will print the heading constantly
when I type  v2x( ); at the command line.
My problem is lack of knowledge programming. I would like to know if any
one has a complete program that I could run and learn from.
Just a program that I could have my robot go one direction for a certain
number fo wheel rotations or length of time then turn another direction
ect,ect,ect. I think I could make changes rotations and directions ect. if
I had a working program to start with and study.
Thanks
Terry P.Gathright
