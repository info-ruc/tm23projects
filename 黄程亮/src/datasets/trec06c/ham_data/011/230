I have recently obtained a digital compass circuit as part of a clock
(it lights an led that points north) but haven't yet tried to interface
with it. I think it will be communicating via SPI but I'm not sure.

The question I want to ask anybody with a V2X is what cpu does it use on
the board ?.

Thank for any help.
