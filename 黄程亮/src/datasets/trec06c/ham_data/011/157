After seeing some of the recent e-mail to this list, I realize that we
should send out the following announcement to the Handyboard list.  IC
3.2 for Windows fixes the problems that a percentage of folks reported
about pcode download problems.

---------------------------------------

Newton Research Labs is pleased to announce Interactive C 3.2 for
Windows 95/NT.  Users of IC 3.1 for Windows 95 and Window NT are
encouraged to download IC 3.2 free of charge.  Your IC 3.1 licenses
are also valid for IC 3.2.  The new version includes minor
enhancements and bug fixes, including:

    * A "Go To Line" menu item,

    * Improved reliability for the initial download of pcode; IC will
      no longer incorrectly complain about the Config register on
      certain machines,

    * The interaction window can no longer be resized to zero size, and

    * A standard windows installation program makes installation easier.

Newton Labs is not releasing a new version of IC for UNIX and
Macintosh, as the bugs are Windows-specific.

Please visit the following web page to download IC 3.2 for Windows
95/NT:

The development team wishes to thank all the customers whose feedback
have helped make Interactive C the best integrated development
environment for Rug Warrior, Rug Warrior Pro, Handyboard, and MIT Lego
Robot Controller Board.
