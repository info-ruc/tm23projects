Hey! Im a realitivly clueless High school guy.  Our Adventures in
Supercomputing group is making a mobile robot using a handyboard and 3 or
4 infared sensors.  Is tyhe bouncey ball method a good one for having a
rover permeate a halled area?  the thinking behind this method is that if
you throw one of those dangerously bouncey super ball bouncey balls they
go everywere, out the cracked window, into the dogs food bowl, into the
guest room.  Anyway...just wondering.
