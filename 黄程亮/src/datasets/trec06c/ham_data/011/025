Yup.  I loaded the sonar.c file and ran the sonar_display() routine.  It
just displays values that make no sense.  The sonar doesn't click and the
diodes get hot.  After recieveing some mail from other, I have come to the
conclusion that the diodes are hooked up properly.  What could be causing
the heat?  Is there a short somewhere?

Thanks all,
Mike
