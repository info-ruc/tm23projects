ok, i finished the digital input circuit and the first time i turned it on both
green and red lights stayed illuminated so i checked the orientation of all the
chips and they were correct so i removed and reinserted them for good measure.
This seemed to fix the light problem. I was then able to send pcode_hb.s19.
When I restarted the handyboard Instead of the Interactive C message, all 32 of
the LCD panels lit dimly. The second time I tried to load pcode_hb.s19 the
Interactive C message appeared to i ran the interactive C program and it loaded
the Interactive C libs. i typed 
c> 1+1;

This proceeded to crash interactve C and nothing appeared on my handyboard.
Since then i have tried this procedure with vairing results

1) Load pcode_hb.s19
2) Restart Handyboard
3)observe results
4)unplug/plug rj-11 from handyboard

I have done this about 10 times hoping to have it work.
sometimes the speaker makes rapid clicking noises, this is accompanied by the
yellow light flashing in unicen on the charger board

once, just the heart appeared on the bottom right on the lcd screen
once random(?) pixels illuminated on the first three panels of the LCD screen.
most of the time after loading pcode_hb.s19 and restarting the board the top 16
panels light darkly for a second and then all 32 panles light dimly.

Any ideas would be appreciated.
