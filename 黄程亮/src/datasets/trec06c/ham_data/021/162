The voltage regulator on my board (U13) gets so hot that when i touched it it
burned my finger. I am using the recomended 12V 500ma ac adaptor. I have been
having problems testing the motor circutry and the red motor lights light up
when i turn the board on. However the board voltage is correct (5.00V). This is
the second voltage regulator i am using because the otherone was giving a board
voltage of 5.13V. I suspect the malfunction was due to the heat it generated.
The orientation is correct. Why is this happening?
