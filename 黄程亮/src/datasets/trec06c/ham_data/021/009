I believe it is a subset of striaght C. However, I never learned C: I junped
straight into C++ before even getting my HB. However, programming was of no
dificulty to me, even thought I only knew C++

IC will work on a computer. I have used it on my 386/sx laptop as well on my
Pentium 2 - 233 desktop. IC has been ported to the IBM/PC. All you need is a
serial port......

IC really is not that hard, especially if you keep the HB technical
reference at your side. The only previous experiance I had had with
programming was a little bit of BASIC, and then C++ (I learned all I know
about c++ from the book 'teach yourself C++ in 21 days' by Jesse Liberty,
and then by reading help files that came with my c++ compiler. C++ can't be
that much more hard than Calc II!
