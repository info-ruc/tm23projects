hello,

does anyone know how to interface the handyboard with a shaft encoder from a
mouse?  i am interested in using one out of a microsoft mouse, which uses
electrical contacts, instead of an optical sensor.  what kind of signal is
sent from the encoder, and need i include all of the circuitry that is already
in the mouse, or can i adapt the encoder to the handyboard thru programming?
thanks.
