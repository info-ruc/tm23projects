Thanks for the Kudos,

Actually the timeline is more like "Clyde" (not pictured), "Robotank"
(Sherman chassis with a miniboard), "RobotTankII" (Sherman Chassis with
6.270 board), "Comet" (not pictured, R/C conversion w/Miniboard),
"Ghost" (not pictured) a Sumo robot with a miniboard, "Sherman" pictured
with a rug Warrior board, "Cougar" (pictured with Miniboard), "Dino" and
"ARBE" simultaneously (I would like to figure out a reasonably priced
"generic" robot for club members to build), then "RoboTankIII" (current
project).
