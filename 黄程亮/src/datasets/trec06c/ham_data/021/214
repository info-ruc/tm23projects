All:

  I am trying to find a World Scale RC Car/Truck base for my robot.
One of the items I have been looking at was the Thunder King RC
Monster Truck from MRC/Tower Hobbies, but they have recently
discontinued that part.
  Does anyone have any suggestions for a fairly large RC base that
would work well with the HandyBoard?  Your comments would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you,
John Woolsey
