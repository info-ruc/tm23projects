     Hi guys,
     
     I am worried about the 2MHz clock speed of the HB.  The robot that I 
     am building has a mouse in the bottom of it and I am writing the 
     program to read the number of digital pulses and calculate the 
     position relative to the starting point.  There are many square roots 
     and unit vector additions in the calculations.  
     Do you think the above speed is good enough for the job?
     
     I know the E series 6811 runs at a faster clock speed.  So can I 
     replace the 6811 chip and the oscillator and get a faster performing 
     controller board?  If yes, please let me know where to get the parts 
     and things to know when making the change.
     
     Thanks every body,
     -anton
