Subject: interfacing V2X compass
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

HB Folks,

I'm currently using the HB to interface to a Vector 2X compass.  I'm
using the compass in RAW slave mode, so it's different than the hardware
interface that's documented on the HB web site.  But I did notice that
the documented interface just left the ~RESET pin float high, so I
assumed that the compass could be trusted to power up reliably as long
as the interfaced pins are connected to i/o lines that boot up in a
high-impedance (as should all of the SPI lines on the 6811).  The V2X
documentation says that should work, and the interface documented on the
HB web site implied that it at least worked for someone.

The problem I'm having is that most of the time this works fine; but
occasionally the V2X gets into some state where it will not power up and
work properly until I momentarily lower the ~RESET line (with a wire
jumper).

Have other folks got the V2X to work reliably for them with the ~RESET
pin left unconnected???

Thanks,

    Rick
