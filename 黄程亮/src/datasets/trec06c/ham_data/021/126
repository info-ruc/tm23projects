You shouldn't lose place if the mouse is serviced by input counters and
interrupt routines, so whether 2 MHz is fast enough depends on how often you
need the positions calculated from the mouse counters.  You won't be able to
get that as fast as the mouse counter updates, but all you have to do is get
the latest and do your calculation.  It's the control aspects using that
information which will determine whether your application is fast enough.
