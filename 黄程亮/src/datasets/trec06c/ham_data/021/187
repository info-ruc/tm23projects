Hello all.

I've settled down into a stable E-mail address again. please update your
bookmarks with this address kevin@urly-bird.com

I've also started recieving the list again.  what is the latest buzz? 
is there a solid theoretical design yet, and if so what are the
parameters?

This is what he wrote, not me:
" I know what my device does. My bud sees major potential 
and just because I never learned advanced physics, or whatever, 
doesn't mean that I can't make it work. In answer to your points. 
((A)). No it is not a battery. 
((B)). The wires do not touch the rods. 
((C)). As far as I know, it will last indefinitely.
((D)). Thanks for the little equation on V and A and stuff but I use a
handheld voltmeter bought from an  electronic shop on the corner 
because I spent all my dough building the device.  
((E)). The TEMI is the DRIVE. The Hyronoline Tank is the POWER 
SOURCE. 
Also, the tank is as real as you or me. It is not a hoax. 
It has been running for three and a half weeks and 
doesn't show any sign of stopping. At present, I think that raising 
the temperature of the fluid may yield more energy."

Jonathan,

Why did your friend want to inform this mailing list of his experiment
while it still is in a premature phase (it has been running only 3 weeks)?
This list can't function if we can't have more exact data or theory.

The availability of infinite obtainable energy in a small container would
make a large part of the subjects of this list useless. This is not a
problem, however such devices need more backup than a single university
friend who "believes" that it will work. Only freedom of information (if
necessary through a patent) about the device will serve as enough backup.
This mailing list can't function in any other way.

If your friend merely did want to ask how he could avoid rapid cooling of
the device in space, then the answer is simple: Insulation.
But of course the propulsion system we need should release enough energy
per second to accelerate a heavy starship. The heating of the device would
only be a fraction of the power compared to the power needed for acceleration.

Timothy

That, unfortunately, was the first thing I suggested. It 
cannot be insulated because it is live. Nothing can touch 
it without being zapped. He didn't want to ground it, so he
put it on some corkboard and blue tacked it in place.

Strongly agree!  This is obviously nothing of interest to this group, or
anyone else with knowledge of energy systems.  Sorry for farwarding him.

I meant THERMAL insulation. This should have to do little with ELECTRICAL
insulation, which is what I think to read in the above message.

So my suggestion is: put the heat-sensitive part of the device in a
thermos-flask. If the device can sit on corkboard and be in normal air, it
should not matter if it for example is inside a mirrored glass flask.

OK, I hope this has cleared up the confusion.

Hey check out

http://www.freedomshipcity.com/index.html

http://popularmechanics.com/popmech/sci/9802STRSAM.html

Its an idea for a floating city ship.  Looks like the project will get funding
and probably launch in 2-3 years.  It cruses around the world as a combination
resort/retirement home, trade center (tariff free) and tourist spot.  25
stories tall, 4300 feet long, onboard airport and marina, and has a population
of tens of thousands.

Its planing to recycle its water and airs not a big step up from there.  So
its functionally very much like a space station on water.  But more important
a self supporting platform that can self fund as  residence & zero tariff
trading port is a very interesting step toward seting up colonies on sea or in
space.  I've heard several times that a floating city is a good testbed for
the economics of a orbiting city, but this is the first project that looks
like its got a practical idea, not just a idealize vision.  (Hey it makes more
sence then colonizing Mars!)  I'm very interested to see how it will come off.

Besides, as I've understood it most Starships would have trouble with
overheating (from all the waste heat of equipment and propulsion systems
on board) because of the lack of a medium to carry the internal termal
energy into space, rather than with "deep-freezing" anyway...
