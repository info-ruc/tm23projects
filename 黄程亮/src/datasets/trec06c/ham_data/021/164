there is probably some other circuit on your board that is drawing too
much power.  put your finger on the other chips and see if any of them
is hot (there shouldn't be any).   if necessary, remove all socketed
chips to see if you can get the vregulator to cool down -- you may
have a failed chip that's drawing the power.
