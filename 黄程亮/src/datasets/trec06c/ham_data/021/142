I am assembling my handyboard and am at the stage where i have completed the
motor and analog circuits. When I test hte analog circuit the LCD screen
prints"press START to test knob..." when i press start the board beeps and the
screen goes blank. when i testmotors() it downloads to the board but the LCD
screen does not change from the IC message. I checked the potential between pin
51 and 52 and measures 5.00 V The board came equipped with a different knob
than the one in the pictures (it is smaller) The testdigitals() functions
worked flawlessly.
any help would be appreciated
thanks
