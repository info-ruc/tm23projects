I figured out all of my problems were caused by using an ac-dc adaptor with=
 the wrong voltage. What is the correct output voltage  for the adaptor tha=
t should be used with the handyboard? Also, I cannot find L1, the iron core=
 inductor. I ordered my handyboard kit from the Hong Kong robot store and i=
nstead of the reddish iron core conductor i have an extra thing that had th=
e shape of a resistor and has a<x-color><param>red=3D25088;green=3D54784;bl=
ue=3D44032</param> teal </x-color>background and for stripes, silver gold b=
lack and brown. is this L1?

Thanks,

sam
