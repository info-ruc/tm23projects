     Some time ago Karl Lundt included in his Amateur Robotics column a short
description of a new Printed Circuit Fabrication material where you ran the
copper clad through a laser printer (to print directly onto the copper rather
than using iron on transfer sheets).  I was wondering if anyone here remembers
where that article appears or if anyone knows the name of the company.  I also
recall that it appeared in QST magazine, though I'm less clear on where.  Any
help would be greatly appreaciated.  

Thanks
Pherd
