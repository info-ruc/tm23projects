Hi all,

I am considering purchasing a handyboard, but Definitly want to get the 
sensor expansion board when available.

1) Do I need to purchase a specific handyboard in order to get the I/O
expansion board to work?  

2) Is Gleason Research a good company to buy from?

3) Are there any examples/kits available for doing some vision analysis?

4) Is there any reason to wait a few months on purchasing one?  Is there a
HandyBoard 2 coming out soon?

I am not that confident with my soldering ability, so I need to get an
assembled one to start with...I don't mind soldering add-ons though.

Thanks!
Gerald
