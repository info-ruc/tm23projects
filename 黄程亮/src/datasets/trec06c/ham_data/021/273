Problem:

 I have built a small robot with differential drive using 3+ACI- diam =
whee
 ls turning at 66 RPM +AEA- full power PWM no load.
 =20
 Each wheel has a 16 pulses per rev. reflective type shaft encoder.
 the robot is controlled by the Handy Board running IC 3.2.
 =20
 I'm fairly new to the robotics field and looking for some info or Tips =
on
 how to accomplish some sort of PID control for this robot.
 =20
 I toyed around with different timing ideas to move the robot 1 rev but  =
I
 soon found out it's very unreliable type of control due to the fact =
that
 each surface has a different drag coefficient and  battery voltage also
 makes a big difference.
 =20
 Another problem I'm facing is that with the L293D IC's have no brake
 capabilities , so once the power to the motor is removed the momentum =
of=20
 the robot  moves the robot past it's target.
 =20
 Precision is limited to 22,5 deg due to the shaft encoder resolution =
but
 it's good enough for the moment.
 =20
 I would appreciate any feedback regarding this problem.
