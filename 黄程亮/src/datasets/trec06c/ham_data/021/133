While any text editor will suffice, I highly recommend one called
TextPad.  It has very powerful features and does an excellent job of
formatting source code.  It's available as shareware from
www.download.com.  (Note:  I'm not getting anything out of this; I just
think it's a great piece of software!)  If you use a word processor
(like MSWord), be sure you save the code as plain text.

Interactive C code does not need to be compiled.  Simply save the code
as a text file in your IC\libs\ folder with a ".c" extension, then run
IC and use the "load" command.  Hope this helps.  Good luck!
