National Semiconductor make an "LM317" 3 terminal adjustable regulator which
can easily be used as a current limiter. I am not sure if the schematic for
this particular application is included with the Data sheets so I'll add it
here.

Current Limiter

________________     R1
Vin       |LM317|___/\/\/\_________Iout
          |_____|Vout     |
             |            |
         Vadj|____________|

Iout = 1.25/R1 where I is the output amperage
