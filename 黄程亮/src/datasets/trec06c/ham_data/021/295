No exploring anywhere is a good idea, but you don't settle there without a

I assume you're actually refering to the GRAVITATIONAL field or else
you've got me really lost... :/

Now how high Velocity could our probe have if we want it to do a 180???

Does anyone know the equation?

Of course, but then you'll have access to whatever machinery was used to
launch it. That's got to be a big advantage? :)

Yeah, you'll have to accelerate the propellant too :(

I just have a funny feeling that there is something that I/we have
missed... There just might be some way of using all these Magnetic fields,
sheets and pauses to provide SOME sort of brakeing :|

Or what about brakeing via a solar sail?

Or (worst-case and ONLY for a really tough probe) what about hard-landing
it??? 

These are just some wild guesses but there's GOT to be something we can
work with???

When I sent out some of the postings that initially failed to

apparently sent them out with the address
owner-starship-design@lists.uoregon.edu in the headers.  I've
sent out a couple more postings that came back to me as a result
of this, but this time made sure to edit the correct address into
the headers.  Please check any replies you make to postings to
make sure they are going to starship-design@lists.uoregon.edu,
and not owner-starship-design, so that your postings won't be
delayed from me having to manually forward them into the list.

Bjorn,

Umm, yes, no, maybe....

It is possible to use a star's magnetic field to swing a probe around a star
and onto a different trajectory (even a reciprocal). The actual amount of
deflection possible is determined by the velocity of the probe and the
strength of the magnetic field of the star in question. Obviously, the
higher the velocity the less deflection or steering that can be
accomplished.

But you still have to stop it when it gets home.

In our discussions, we have been able to pretty much agree that there are
several viable methods of accelerating a ship up about .3 or maybe even .4
c. Unfortunately, these methods almost always rely on some trick which
cannot be provided at the other end to slow the vehicle down. Simply
doubling onboard reaction mass or fuel is not the answer. If you do the math
you will discover that doubling the mass of the vehicle will decrease the
cruise velocity significantly and drastically increase mission length.

Propulsion wise, what we need as a BARE MINIMUM is a self contained
accelerate/decelerate capability in the 100,000 m/sec range, or put another
way, a 200,000 m/sec total change in delta v. This would enable us to reach
the nearer stars within the lifespan of a single person (but not necessarily
to return within one person's lifetime.)

I am working from memory here, but I think the best we can currently manage
is only 200 m/sec, which is quite a bit shy of the minimum. We may be able
to reach 100,000 m/sec buy combining several different systems i.e. a
powered perihelion maneuver with a maser sail last stage, but this is again,
only one way.

Excuse my Ignorance but wouldn't it be possible to Use the target Star's
Gravity to "swing" the probe around and into a return orbit to Earth (or
at least close enough to our solar system to be recovered in some way.)

Just curious...

Yes, I meant MAGNETIC. It's called Lorentz Force Turning. A charged object
moving through a magnetic field experiences a force at right angles ti its
direction of motion and the magnetic field. The magnitude of the force is
described by the equation:

|Fbar| = |QVbar * Bbar| = QVBsin theta

where Q is the charge on the object, Bbar is the magnetic field vector, Vbar
is the velocity vector, and theta is the angle between Vbar and Bbar.
Skipping a bit of math involving the application of Newton's Second Law,
this can be reduced to:

r = mV/QB

where r is the radius of the orbit, m is the object's mass.

Hope this helps <G>

	I was reading some of the numbers for the various engines that
could be used to power a starship, and I noticed that every fusion
reaction shown only used its fuel once.  If a closed powerplant (not
rocket) could be run hot enough, there's no reason I can see not to run
the fuel up to heavier elements instead of just throwing it away after it
turns to helium. Note:  I didn't do any math for this one, it might be
impractical.  Although I realize that a scheme like this would require
reactors far superior to a today's can't-quite-ignite tokamaks, it might
be doable in fifty years. The power from this type of reactor could be
used to power a laser or ion drive, the latter prehaps adding the
reactor exhaust to the Xenon reaction mass. 
	The upshot is, exhaust recycling could reduce the amount of fuel
required by which is one of the major hurdles of starflight.
