Hello All,=20

I posted a little note a while back about our use of the HB on the two
bikes that our local high school is using in solar bike races in Topeka a=
nd
Akita, Japan.  Well the races are over and I thought that some of you may
be interested in the results. =20

The bikes are stock bike frames with motor power, a minimum of 1.2 sq.
meters of solar panels and batteries.  The electrical system is
supplemental to the rider supplied power.  The races are 100 km.  The ide=
a
is to make the best use of what power you have to help the rider.  The HB=
s
were used to monitor battery voltage and current, bike speed, and control
settings.  The HBs were also able to directly control the solid state mot=
or
speed controllers.  The displays gave the riders information like battery
voltage, current, accumulated amp-hours, speed, and control settings.  Al=
l
in all it worked great.

So for the results;

In the SunRaye in Topeka ;=20
http://sunrayce.gmr.com/sea/bike_raycing/bikerayce.html

Our Boys team took a second place in the =93A=94 category under 18 group.
The girls team took a first place in the =93A=94 category under 18 group.

In the World Solar Bike Race in Akita ;
http://www.ogata.or.jp/english/wsr/98wsbr/98wsbr.htm=20

The boys team took first place in the =93A=94 category overall (that incl=
uded
the under 18 and mens groups).
The girls team took a second place in the =93A=94 category under 18 group.
Both teams took first place in the spring portion of the race.  That=92s
where they sprint a short track before the race for starting position.

The link to the Akita race has a few pics of the bikes and riders.  Its a
little hard to see but the HBs are hanging from a set of Aero Bars locate=
d
on the front of the handlebars.

A few months ago when I first posted a message about this I got a few
requests about the details.  That is coming (I hope).  I=92m trying to ge=
t
the kids to do that.  We are starting up a web page with pics and details
of the bike.  BUT....  These a re HS kids and it is summer and... and...
and..=20

Anyway I thought I would pass this info along since we did use the HB on
the bikes with what I consider great success.  Being able to know exactly
how much power is being used from the batteries and having the ability to
accurately control the power consumption is a valuable tool.  (Plus I=92v=
e
got more bragging rights than most on this project since my son was one o=
f
the boy=92s team riders)

Special thanks to Fred for the design and the advice he was able to give =
us
when we had some charging problems in Japan. (If your taking one of these
thing to Japan don=92t forget to factor in the 100V AC they have)
