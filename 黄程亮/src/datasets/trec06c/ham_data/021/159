I am in the need for additional digital outputs. 
I have read the FAQ and found out that to get 8 more 
digital outs, I have to connect the 'hc374' clock line 
to any of the unused output latch selects of the 'hc138'.

Has anyone done this? If so, any feedback?
Does anyone know the number of the pins on the chips that are involved in 
this?
What would be their address? 0x???? and which out is which bit?

Thanx in advance
Ilya
