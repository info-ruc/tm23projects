anton,

     You might want to think about getting rid of all those square roots.
Take a look at what you are really trying to do and decide if you need the
square root.  For example, if you are just compairing two distances to see
which is greater, you can leave the numbers as squares.  With a little head
scratching you ought to be able to develop a navigation system that is
strictly integer.
