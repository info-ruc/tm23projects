I have 2 large motors that draw about 2 amps. They are powered by a battery
that's 6v at 2amp. How can I limit the motors so that they can only draw 1/2
amp?????

I know on my first robot (ahh, fine memories of burning resistors), I just
made a bank of resistors, but that got extremely hot and melted the nearby
electrical tape and even softened the LEGO piece it was on. What method
would be better?

thanks!
