"Handyboard for Dummys"...
No, just kidding.  Maybe not just yet.  :)

Check the HB HP for the "HB Technical Reference".  You can download it.
Gleason Electronics sells HB kits and Assembled HB's.  They have a 
starter package.

Get IC 3.2 from Newton Research Labs . It cost like $35 (?).  But, it's 
better.

You can find akll the above info on the HB HP as well.
