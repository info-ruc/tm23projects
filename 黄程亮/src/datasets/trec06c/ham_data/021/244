Subject: ports question (cont)

... just to follow up on my question: i'm trying to read
the photosensors through the analog ports.
however, the value returned by analog(i) is always
255, so perhaps i have the sensors hooked
wrong.

when i read "analog(0);" it always 
retunes 255, no matter how much light
i am shining upon the sensor, which i
have plugged into the rightmost set
of holes in the analog bank.

btw, i am able to turn the motors fwd/rev/off,
and can printf(). basically, the hb (which i bought
assembled) seems to work, so i'm sure i just
have something wrong with my understanding of
how to hook into the analog (and digital) ports.
 
thank you for your time
