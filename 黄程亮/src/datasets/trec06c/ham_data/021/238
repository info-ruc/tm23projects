Hi,

I've built several robots over the years and for the RoboExpo in SF I
put together a web page with pictures showing them off. Most are R/C
conversions but you can view them at
	http://professionals.com/~cmcmanis/robotics/family.html

I'm happy to answer questions as well. All except the last one use a
Miniboard, Robotank III's base controller is a handyboard, its upper
level decision making will be based on the Motorola ColdFire board.
