We have been using the Radio Shack, Archer board #276-162A.

Specifications:
	Dimensions 3 inches x 4 inches, with copper lands on one side.
	30 holes by 25 holes
	with mounting holes at 2.5 inch and 3.5 inch spacing.

We have to told that Radio Shack stores no longer carry this item.

We are in need of 60 boards now.  Since the board is a good general PCB we
would like to find a supplier.

Any help to find a source is appreciated.
