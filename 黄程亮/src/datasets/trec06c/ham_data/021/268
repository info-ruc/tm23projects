It's not impossible. The easiest way is to use the same technique as
Java (or IC) and write an embedded interpreter that executes code for a
"psuedo" machine. The resulting machine can have arbitrarily strict
access restrictions between tasks. You do have to take away some C
"features" like casting an arbitrary value to a pointer, etc, but you
can do it. 

I'm curious how the "users" of your system would be motivated to crash
it. If you're simply looking for a "safe" development environment
consider a version of BASIC without poke...
