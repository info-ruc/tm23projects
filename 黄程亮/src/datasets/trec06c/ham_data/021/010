The freeware version of IC is very much a subset of standard C, let alone C++.It
is extremely limited, and in my opinion, quite buggy.

If you don't already know C, this is not the way to learn it.  The bugs and
limitations in the
freeware version could completely destroy your understanding of the language.

This is not to say that IC isn't a great product...  in fact it is almost
perfect for what it intends to do, and you can count on it to learn some basic
programming skills, just don't expect that it will let you REALLY learn 'C'.
