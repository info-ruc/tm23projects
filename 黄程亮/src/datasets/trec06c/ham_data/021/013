Hello All,

Just a quick question,

On the handyboard there is a socket header for the 7 analog inputs, 
and 9 digital outputs.

There is actually three rows of headers for these inputs.
I am enquiring as to what are the three headers for?

I am currently using the top row for the signal, the middle row for 
the common, and the bottom line is not wired.

i.e.

_____________________________
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo      Signal
---------------------------------------------------
_____________________________
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo      Common
---------------------------------------------------
_____________________________
ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo      Unknown
---------------------------------------------------

What is the third line for, and are I wiring them correctly.

I know I could look at the wiring under the board, but to save me 
pulling a Handyboard out of the (student proof) containers, I am 
hoping someone could answer this question.
