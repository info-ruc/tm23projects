Actually I was thinking of it more as a model for space development,
specifically space stations, but they are obviously similar.  Thou a 50,000
person floating city is a big jump past a 700 person interstellar survey ship.

Well the current cost to orbit is a side effect of political factors and the
current trivial flight rates.  Obviously just lifting the fuel for a starship
like ours would drive the launch industry up orders of magnitude in size, and
down orders of magnitude in costs.  However the resulting cost (assuming
current technology) might be less then an airliner, but far more then an ocean
frieghter.

Well were not that far down.  The Vikings could even dream of the technology
the floating city would use.  We already have most of the technologies a
starship would need.  Thou obviously some wild cards like zero=point energy
would be a BIG help.  ;)

Depends on what kind of propulsion you use. To get it there fast is
virtually impossible with current technology. 

To give you an example of how bad it really is, this is how much it
would take to send a school bus sized payload past Alpha Centauri in 900
years:

Propellant:       Specific Imp.:            Fuel mass:
=======================================================
Chemical           500                      10^137kg (not enough mass in
universe)
Nuclear fission    5000                     10^17kg (a billion
supertankers)
Nuclear fusion     10000                    10^11kg (a thousand
supertankers)
Antimatter         50000                    10^5kg (ten railway tankers)

If you want to get there faster that 900 years, it gets worse. If you
want to actually stop at the destination, it gets even worse. That's why
I don't believe we will make it with any of these propulsion systems. It
would be better for a 2 kg probe, but not good.

None of the Mars coloinization concepts offer a plausibly way the Colony could
pay its way (colonies and cities that arn't profitable become ghost towns),
this flosting city can, and its: cheaper, more accesable, has a greater
surface area to colonize, and far less servicing and transport problems.

Ah, I understand. I thought you were adverse to exploring Mars.
Colonizing it also does not make much sense to me.

I'm not so sure whether the numbers in the table are correct, however the
table does depict an important characteristics: (Kyle, next time you do
calculations please include some rough guide of how you got the numbers.)
- A low specific impulse (Isp) is really bad from a total energy (and thus
mass) point of view.
- A relative small increasing in the Isp will yield spectacular decreases
in energy consumption and thus mass of the fuel.

I'd like to remark that of the 10^5 kg in the last case, only VERY LITTLE
(140 gram) has to be anti-matter, because the amount of energy needed to
give 10^5 kg a velocity of about 5E5 m/s is "relatively" small.

Increasing the Isp to more than 3E5 seconds (exhaust velocities of more
than 1% of the speed of light) will be necessary before any serious probe
will be sent.
>From an energy point of view this doesn't need anti-matter, fusion can
provide enough energy in a relative small package as well. The question is
whether that energy can deliver what we need: few but fast particles.

What can you put in a 2kg package that will justify the expense? If
nanotech procedes, there is hope, but if not...

You can't stop the thing; so what are you going to observe flying
through so quickly? After all, this group is for discussing sending a
manned mission to another star. I posted the real, if somewhat
dissapointing, fuel needs. The only hope I see for a manned mission
anyways is if we figure out how to manipulate gravitation and
space-time. Then we might get somewhere. How to do it...we don't know.
Yet.

We had some problems with darkwing.uoregon.edu last night that
seem to have prevented a few posts from being redistributed (and
I was busy trying to bring darkwing back to life so I haven't
gotten to them until now).  I'll be forwarding them back into the 
list momentarily.

Gene,

Robert Forward proposed an interstellar probe based on a perforated sail
design combined with gravity assist and beamed microwave power. The payload
was to be 4 grams of intelligent microcircuitry embedded within the actual
structure of the craft - something that is not so far fetched any more - we
actually know how to do this!
Forward's calculations showed that we could accelerate starwisp (his name
for it) to 20 percent of the speed of light within only a few days. This
would deliver the probe to Alpha Centauri within about twenty years.

You must note however, that this is a "flyby" at twenty percent of the speed
of light with a very limited payload and extremely limited data return. It
may not be very useful, especially in light of what we can potentially see
from Earth orbit with advanced optics.

Using current and near-term technology, how fast could we get a 2

Kyle,

You weren't being fair, you simply quoted from NASA's "Warp Drive When?"
page. A 2 kg probe is in the starwisp class and we already know how to get
one of those up to 30 percent of lightspeed with virtually no fuel. that
would put it passing through any of these systems within fifty to a hundred
years. Well, maybe not 61 Cygni...

Lee

Depends on what kind of propulsion you use. To get it there fast is
virtually impossible with current technology.

To give you an example of how bad it really is, this is how much it
would take to send a school bus sized payload past Alpha Centauri in 900
years:

Propellant:       Specific Imp.:            Fuel mass:
=======================================================
Chemical           500                      10^137kg (not enough mass in
universe)
Nuclear fission    5000                     10^17kg (a billion
supertankers)
Nuclear fusion     10000                    10^11kg (a thousand
supertankers)
Antimatter         50000                    10^5kg (ten railway tankers)

If you want to get there faster that 900 years, it gets worse. If you
want to actually stop at the destination, it gets even worse. That's why
I don't believe we will make it with any of these propulsion systems. It
would be better for a 2 kg probe, but not good.

It is a thought experiment. And you could put a radio beacon in there to
justify the expense. TV signals may not be reaching nearby stars.

Actually the numbers for a couple hundred thousand ton ship with a max speed
of .4 light (with a external Boost to speed) was 25 million tons, not billions
of tons.  Thou carrying the accel and decel fuel internally would add several
0's.

Didn't do the caluculations, they were from a NASA web page.
