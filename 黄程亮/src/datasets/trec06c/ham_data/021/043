Has any new information on the IC floating point bug come up?  I have
been coding neural networks into my robot and was having problems.
A simple 'test' network of simple values ran fine, but when I manually
entered a real evolved network with many significant digits I got
garbage results.  I assumed I had a problem somewhere with my code and
have been tearing out my hair, but if it is just a problem with 
entering long literal strings of digits...

So what is up with NewtonLabs?  I am an honest-to-gosh paying owner
of IC 3.2, and emailed their support address months ago with a question
about "how much global variable space is possible in IC", and have heard
nothing.  Will they ignore this problem too?

Mildly annoyed, Skye.

PS: 
Does anyone *else* know how much global variable space is available?
>From the FAQ:
User program object code plus user global variables: 16320 bytes available

My code is about 10K in size, but I have problems with assigning more 
than about 60 bytes of global variable space.  It does *not* seem
limited by available user space.
