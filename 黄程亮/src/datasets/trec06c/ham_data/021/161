Option #1:  How about making some of your own?  If you need 60, then the
prices from board houses start getting pretty low.  Check out these
places:

http://www.apcircuits.com
http://www.advancedcircuits.com
http://www.expresspcb.com

I made up a small spreadsheet for expresspcb and apcircuits pricing, and
at quantity 60 you can get boards for about $10 each from ExpressPCB, and
$9 each from APcircuits (3" x 4" board, single or double-sided,
plated-through holes). Crank up the quantities or crank down the board
area and the prices go down.  You also have the option of customizing the
board for exactly your use.

ExpressPCB uses their own software (downloadable for free last time I
looked) to do the layout, while apcircuits accepts standard Gerber files
and drill files.  I have not used any of these services, but I plan on
trying out APcircuits in the coming months.

APcircuits is in Calgary, which might also affect your decision.


Option #2:  Another thing to check out is "TechAmerica", which is
apparently another Tandy company?  They are connected to Radio Shack in
some manner, and you can buy their catalogs at Radio Shack.  They have a
lot of parts and project kits and such, and may carry the type of board
that Radio Shack no longer does.

Good luck,
