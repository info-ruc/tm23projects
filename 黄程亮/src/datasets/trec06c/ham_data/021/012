I have one extra HandyBoard that I will sell if anyone needs one.  It
is a fully assembled and tested board with Serial Interface/Charger
Board and cases.  It  has never been used in a project (about 2 months
old).  I built two of these and find that I am only going to need one
for now.  It has the 68HC11E1 micro installed.

It does NOT include an IR demodulator and I do NOT have an extra 
LCD display, so it does not include a display either.  These two
missing items amount to about $15.

$225, if interested:
