Hello mario,

Its actually very simple,

use an uln2803, connect it to an not used port (i.e. porta in my case),
connect the coil wires to the appropriate pins, and the supply lines to
the stepper vcc. now you can write values to the port. you should write
the step sequence to the port and the stepper should step. be sure to
add some delays between steps if your handyboard is fast, my own is
running at 16 mhz (e = 4) and i need the delays. for the wiring scheme
of the 2803 look ath the following page

http://home.wxs.nl/~luberth/plotter/plotter.htm

here is information on wiring the steppers to an PIC, but it works the
same.

also look at
http://www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm
for stepper motor info
