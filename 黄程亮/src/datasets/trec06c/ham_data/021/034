Hi All,

That color code on inductor should read:

BROWN(1), BLACK(0), GOLD, SILVER which is (1x10^0)uF => 1uF.

Sorry for the confusing and we will mark that in the future.

Thanks.

Patrick

I figured out all of my problems were caused by using an ac-dc adaptor with
the wrong voltage. What is the correct output voltage  for the adaptor that
should be used with the handyboard? Also, I cannot find L1, the iron core
inductor. I ordered my handyboard kit from the Hong Kong robot store and
instead of the reddish iron core conductor i have an extra thing that had
the shape of a resistor and has
a<x-color><param>red=25088;green=54784;blue=44032</param> teal
</x-color>background and for stripes, silver gold black and brown. is this
L1?

Thanks,

sam
