One Handyboard, from Gleason Research, specifically GRHB-PC, with all
cables, power supply, software, LCD, battery, charger board, etc.  Get
it with two Lego 9 volt gearmotors (they cost me $19 each) and my key
for IC 3.2.  
Used for one small project, then put back in box.  Dodn't need all the
bells and whistles this thing has over the miniboard, and don't have a
use for IC  (not that I don't think it's a great environment, I'd just
rather use assembly language or ICC11!)

all for $235 plus shipping.  (from California)
