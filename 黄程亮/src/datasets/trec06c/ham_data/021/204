<b><u>Truth About Hoodia</u></b><br><br>
</font>
<font size="2" color="white" face="verdana,arial">
The truth about food after 40 is that it is required<br> 
for maintenance only. We really don't need to eat that<br>  
much to keep healthy, trim and fit. The problem is we<br>  
live in a culture that forces food at us. Here in America<br> 
the tendency is to snack all day. For many of us there<br> 
are no meal times. We sneak down to the fridge at two<br> 
in the morning and hit the HaagenDaz, consume huge<br>  
amounts of calories and still not feel full.<br>  
We think too much about food, make too many ceremonies<br> 
around it.<br><br>
<b><i>But how can we stop?</b></i><br><br> 

Hoodia diet pill kills the appetite and attacks obesity,<br> 
is organic with no synthetic or artificial appetite<br>  
control agents, has no known side effects, contains<br>  
a miracle molecule (up to 100,000 times more powerful<br> 
than glucose) that fools the brain into believing<br>  
you are full, and even stops you from thinking about food.<br><br>   
<b><i>But it actually does MORE...</i></b><br><br> 

Moreover, aside from using it to stop unbearable hunger,<br>  
provide unperturbed energy (not jitters or sleeplessness),<br> 
and shore up emotional centeredness, the San also use it<br>  
to treat diabetes and hypertension. It's even said to cure<br> 
hangovers and upset stomachs too. With no noted downsides<br> 
and no known side effects...<br> <br> 
<b><i>What more could you ask?</b></i><br>
