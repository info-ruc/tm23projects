hi

i have a java app which gets input from the serial port via 
jni (java native interface) and c++.

i'd like to get input from 4 photo sensors via the handyboard.

however, i read in the FAQ that because i'm running 
windows nt, i will need to "turn off" the COM port 
in order for the hb downloader/ic to work. 

but i need to be able to access the COM port from 
within my dll which holds my native code.

is there a way to make this work? 

thanks,

sawad
