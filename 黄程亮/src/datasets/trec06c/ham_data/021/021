Joseph,
I am new to the handyboard myself but as a professional software
engineer, I can give you some pointers on the software issues.

When they say that IC is a subset of C they mean that there are certain
ANSI C features that will not be found in IC. There is NO C++ in IC
(Thank Goodness). Do not get a book with C++ unless you really want to
be frustrated. C is a wonderfully powerful and terse language and you
don't want or need C++ for simple robotics. 
I would recommend "C for Dummies" from the ...for Dummies series from
IDG publishing. Keep in mind that this will be written for writing
programs for a PC and spends a lot of time on printing messages to the
screen but the information you will need is in there.

Regarding your comment about a "simpler language":
Most "simpler languages" do not make effiecient code which means that
you may save time in development but the program won't run fast enough
or will chew up all of your memory. I personally don't think that basic
is easier than C once you understand the workings. But then I grew up on
assemblers!

I don't have my handyboard yet so I can't help with the mechanics but
you shouldn't need unix.
