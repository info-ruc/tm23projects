I checked the ECHO signal and found it to be at 2.0V when plugged into
TIC3 on the HB.  I also applied a pull-up resitor which did send ECHO
to 5V when not pinging.  However, in both cases, I still had seemingly
random positive and negative values returned from the sonar.

Any insight would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Sheridan
