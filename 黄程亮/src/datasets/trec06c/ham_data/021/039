I also wanted a small board with MCU, memory, serial and a bus to the
outside world. This way i made a general io board and could connect
anything to it.

You can buy the hc11F1 in 4 speeds, with a freq up to 16 Mhz, setting
the e-clock to 4. This gives 250 ns cycle time. In the ref. manual you
can find the mcu codes for the speeds, i don't know excact, but
something like 68hc11F1FN4

Also did you do anything special because of the

My prototype is wirewrapped, i had some problems because of this, some
bad connections. Also you should take into account the cycle time.
Because during reads and writes during e-clock high you have 125 ns
timing. If you use decoded r/~w and ather system signals, you should
check the timing. I use a flash with 90 ns access time, and i also use a
74hct139 for system signal decoding (r/~w, E-clk).
