Hello all,

i'm trying to write a small OS, but am confused about something.

I don't want to give access to all memory locations for the user, only
for the supervisor. 
Since the 68hc11 doens't have these modes i have to think of something
else. A sollution is a external mmu, but this maybe some overkill.

Does anyone have some suggestions, or is it simply impossible to do.

Regards
Richard Meester
