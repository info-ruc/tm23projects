Howdy from Texas.

I have set myself the goal of making a robot with the handyboard --
just for the learning of it.  Until 2 days ago I had zero knowledge of
electronics, although I am teaching myself using some kits and books.

I also do not know C language, although I have taken FORTRAN and COBOL
in the dark ages of my days as an unsuccessful computer science
undergrad.  So, if you will pardon my ignorance and my background (I
have an MA in Applied Linguistics) and accept my enthusiasm and
motivation as a ransom, could y'all answer the following inquiries.
Know that I have read the 6.270 handbook and also most of the
handyboard tech reference, and also Art of Lego.

(1)  When you say IC is a subset of C, do you mean C or C++ ?  I
imagine I will have to teach myself C, but was confused at the store
that most books were for C++.

(2)  What do =I= need to program with IC on my PC (Pentium 233 or so)?
I imagine I would need UNIX?  Would the line editor for IC work on my
PC as well as MITY Athena, whatever that is?

(3)  I was going to ask if anyone had a "cheat sheet" for the resistor
color bands, but I found an excellent one on the web, thank goodness.
:-)

I think the IC would be the hardest to tackle, and so it may be better
for me to not even try it, but stick to a simpler language, esp. as I
have not had a math class in 15 yrs, although that was Calc II.

Any comments anybody wants to throw at me?  I appreciate the feedback
about Fischertechnic and I gobbled up 3 big sets (1400 pieces) for
half price this weekend.
