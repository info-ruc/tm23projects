the other issue that should be mentioned re: changing clock speed is
that it messes up the baud rate of the serial communications.  if you
plan to use interactive C, would have re-assemble the pcode program
with a different baud rate constant, to achieve the target rate of
9600 baud.  (this is the rate that the PC hosted Interactive C program
communicates at.) not all baud rates are available at all system clock
rates; 9600 baud might not be available on the 6811 at other than the
standard 8 MHz crystal/2 MHz system clock.

In your message you said:
