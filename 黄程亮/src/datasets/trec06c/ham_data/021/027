I'm trying to make the polaroid ultrasonic motion detector compatible with
the crickets.  Does anyone know where I can find a data sheet for these
detectors?  I unfortunately broke the last one I was using.  I think I must 
have exceeded either the acceptable voltage or current limits.  It would be 
nice to get my hands on a data sheet before I break another one.
Thanks,
Ava Erickson
