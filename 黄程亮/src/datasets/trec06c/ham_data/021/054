     Hi every body...
     
     I need help guys!
     So far in my life I haven't done any thing like this, but I like to learn.
     Is there an idiot's guide for a beginner to start programming a handy 
     board?
       
     Can some body tell me where to buy a handy board and which version is 
     the best for me.
     
     Thanks,
     -anton
