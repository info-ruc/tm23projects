hi,
I have gone thru the Handy board expansion schmetic circuit version 3.0 by
Mr.Fred Martin whcih updated on the June 14,1998.  I have some doubts :

1) What and where is the the Analog pass-through connector (J4) and Motor
power pass-through connector (J6) situated in the Handybd ?

2) This is an important and urgent issue . 
    From the expansion circuit, there are two  74HC374 (U1 & U4) used for
expansion. How and WHERE does the input lines from D0 to D7  to be
connected ? I find no space to be connected or tap-out  from the handybd .
Can I do such a way that I insert the input  lines of D0 to D7 of the two
74HC374
into the  digital inputs from pin8 to pin15 (near the  battery & power LED)
for connection? 

3) How should I initialise with program  of the output and input digital
and analog respectively ?

4) Can the expansion board expand further for digital inputs ?

Please help me to clarify the doubts. I need it urgently for my project.
Thank you.
rgds,
phillip chia
