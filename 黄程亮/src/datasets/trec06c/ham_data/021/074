Hi.  The beta testers are still discovering issues, so I'm not ready
to release the design just yet.  I'm particularly waiting for results
of multi-servo testing.

But, it appears that the basic design is sound, and only minor rework
(if any) will be needed.

The board will be a double-sided board.  I will post artwork
concurrently with its release.

Thanks for checking in.

Fred
