To Anyone Interested,
	I have a nearly brand new complete Handy Board for Sale.  I used it 
one week and unfortunately it does not have the capability to do what I want. 
 It is complete with battery installed, serial/charger board, software for 
IBM, power supply, Assembly, IC, and Handy Board Manuals.  It comes in a nice 
portable padded case for safe travel.  It is brand new and fully functional. 
All of this for $215 plus shipping.  Email me at pwebb@ieee.org if 
interested.  First reply has first priority.
