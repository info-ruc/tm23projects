You may be trying to draw more current that your external battery can 
handle.  The HB Nicd battery can supply alot of current, both surge abd 
continuous.  This may be why it works in this case.  If your external 
battery is not NiCd, it might cause a problem.  Try other sources and see 
if you get any results.
