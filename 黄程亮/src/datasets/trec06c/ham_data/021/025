Subject: What types of IBMs does IC Run on?

Greetings,
     I have recently gotten the free version of IC working.  It was a battle
and it seems that the type of host processor makes a difference.  Running IC
on an old IBM XT (8088) CPU produces the following error whenever a routine
using floating point is loaded:

C:\IC >ic
 
{ lots of welcome stuff including Version 2.851 (Jul 27 1994) }

Loading /ic/libs/lib_hb.lis
{ files loaded } 

run-time error M6107: MATH
 - floating-point error: unemulated

     Doing exactly the same thing on my Pentium system (In a Dos window) works
just fine.  Rick Moll tells me that running on his 486 Lap top works fine as
well.  So the question for the list is what types of machines work with IC.
Scan the responces to this question, and if you don't see your machine type
listed, please post it.

Thank you,
Fred Thompson
