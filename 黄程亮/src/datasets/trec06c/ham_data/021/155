The sensor connectors on the HB already have pullup resistors on the signal
inputs (as I recall they were 47K), so you shouldn't need to add an
additional pullup.  If you want to make sure, just check the signal
connection with a voltmeter to verify that it's close to 5V when the sonar is
not being pinged.
