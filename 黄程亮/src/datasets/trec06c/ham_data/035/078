Subject: Need Help - 68HC11E1/68HC24 and 32K external RAM
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I have a HB w/exp brd and have just acquired a TCOMP PortMaster board
(by Ray's Tiny Racers) which I would like to use on a 'robot dispatch
base station'. Other than two PWM motor ports it has no other
accessories ( ei beeper, IR detect etc.). It uses an E1 along with the
68HC24 and 32K battery-backed external RAM. The TCOMP comes with limited
documentation. I have found little info on using the 68HC24 other than
what is in the Motorola Ref Manual ("The Pink Bible"). From what I
understand is that the 68HC24 recovers Ports B and C which were used for
addressing external memory and is transparent to software. IC does not
have any support for the TCOMP. However, I am able to use the RugWarrior
pcode to access the motor ports, porta and porte but not Ports B and C.

If any one has used the E1 with the HC24, I would truly appreciate any
help or suggestions.

Thanks,
Ranjit
