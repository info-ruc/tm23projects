it's extremely unlikely that removing a battery will have done any
harm.

which program precisely are you using to download the pcode?  you
should be using HBDL.EXE or DL.EXE or DLM.EXE.  you should be trying
to download PCODE_HB.S19.  

also, make sure your board is in "bootstrap download mode" when you
begin the download.  this is done by holding down the stop switch
while turning the board on.
