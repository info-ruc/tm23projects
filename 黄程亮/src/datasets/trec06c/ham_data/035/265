re: exp bd SPI pins:

* 2 of the pins are used by the sonar and aren't separately
available.
* the other 2 SPI pins are at PCB holes J20 and J21.

see the schem for details:

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbexp30/expsch30.gif

if you need all 4 spi pins for something, leave out the j11 sonar
connector and tap the signals from there.
