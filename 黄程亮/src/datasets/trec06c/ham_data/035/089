I picked up a surplus remote control at Halted Specialties
  (http://www.halted.com/) and am trying to use Max Davies' IRINT.ICB,
  IR.C and TEST.C, and I'm not having any luck.

I'm seeing two main problems.

1) Some keys give 35 bits of data, and some give 38 bits.

2) The raw data for any given key changes between subsequent presses,
  switching back and forth between two values. 
  
For instance, the "1" key gives 38 bits, with 8004002000 on one 
  press, then 4002001000 on the next, and then back to 8004002000. 

The "2" key gives 35 bits, cylcing between  8020828020 on one press 
  and 4024024020 on the next.

I had the same problem with the remote for my Magnavox VCR. THe remote
  for my Sony TV works fine with the sony_ir routines, so I'm pretty
  sure the Handy Board and the IR receiver module are workin ok.

The surplus remote is a TV remote, but has no indication as to what
  brand it is for.

Am I dealing with RC-5 coded remotes? If so, is there any software 
  for the Handy Board that will decode RC-5? Or am I facing some other
  issue?

Here are typical values that TEST.C is giving me for pulse widths:

Pulse_mode:	1		Bits:	38 or 35
Lpulse:		1150		Lspace:	630
1pulse:		2000		1space:	700
0pulse:		1000		0space:	700
Tpulse:		1030		Tspace: 1030

BTW, the Tpulse and Tspace are always identical. Looking in TEST.C,
  they are both set to the same value. Is this a bug?

  Thanks for any light anyone can shed,
