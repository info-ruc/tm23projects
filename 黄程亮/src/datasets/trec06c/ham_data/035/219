Hi,

I am trying to get communication working between two HBs via the RJ11 
serial port.  I read the FAQ on the HB web site and I have the right cable. 
 On the trans.  HB the power LED blinks which indicates it is transmitting. 
 Also whenever I turn on the Trans. HB the recieving HB says 255.  Below is 
the code I am running on both HBs.

Thanks

-Peter

Here's the code I am running the recieving HB:
void disable_pcode_serial()     /* disable board handshaking with IC   */
                                /* on the host computer, allowing user */
                                /* programs to receive serial data     */
{
    poke(0x3c, 1);
}

int serial_getchar()            /* read a serial character.  Note:  the */
                                /* program hangs until a character is   */
                                /* received!  There is no timeout!      */
{
    while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x20));     /* wait until a character arrives 
*/
    return (peek(0x102f));              /* return it as an int */
}
void main()
{
int x=0;
disable_pcode_serial();

while(1)
{
	printf("\n%d",serial_getchar());
}
}

The transmitting HB:
void serial_putchar(int c)      /* send a serial character.  Note:  the */
                                /* program hangs until the character is */
                                /* sent!  There is no timeout!          */
{
    while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x80));     /* wait until it's okay to send */
    poke(0x102f, c);                    /* send the character */
}

void main()
{
int x=0;

while(x < 250)
{
	serial_putchar(x);
	x++;
}
}
