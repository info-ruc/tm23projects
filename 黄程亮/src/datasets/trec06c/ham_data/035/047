Hi,

The "Projects in Play" Web page is up:

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/classes/play99/

The assignments for next week (though there is no class meeting) and
the readings for the week after that are detailed thereon.

We will continue to add to both this page and our individual pages
over the course of the semester. If you have suggestions, please don't
hesitate to offer them...

Kwin
