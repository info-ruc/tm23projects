It is correct that you can use the remaining SPI pins as digital outs to
trigger a second sonar.  I've done it and it works fine.

It's also true that there *is* signal contention on the echo lines if you
simply plug 'em both into the same TIC port.  I don't yet know whether
diodes will fix the problem, but I'll give it a try and let you all know.
