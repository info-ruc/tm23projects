I have seen this occasionally.  As long as it's consistent for each key, I
think the best bet is to just assume the data size is the larger of the two
with trailing 0's for the shorter one.  I can't promise this works though,
as I've only had a single hands-on example of this case.

This is really bizarre.  Because it is consistent it doesn't look like a
hardware problem, it's more likely I have a bug in the software somewhere.

My routines do not currently support RC-5 because I do not own a remote
using RC-5 to use for test purposes.  However, based on feedback from other
users, I have tried to include a warning message in the software if it
SEEMS that the remote is using the RC-5 standard.  I cannot guarantee that
the warning message will really work because I have no test device, but if
you repeatedly get the message "RC-5 NOT SUPPORTED" that should give you a
hint.  Note though, that this message might also appear in error if any
'garbage' signal is received due to excessive sunlight, low battery
conditions, etc.

It is very interesting that you mention a result of Pulse_mode 1.  This is
unusual, and again is not a case that I can test with the remotes that I
own.  I have recently (within the past few weeks) tried to correct apparent
bugs regarding the pulse mode.  Please contact me privately at
mdavies@cam.org and tell me what version of my IR routines you are using,
and we can try to hammer out the problem.

No, this is normal.  In real life, the "trailer space" is what happens
after the signal is finished, and is potentially infinite in length.  The
only reason a trailer space is included in the settings is to help separate
one signal from another should you transmit more than one button press in a
row.
