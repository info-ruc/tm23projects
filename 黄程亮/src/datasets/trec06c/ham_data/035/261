I am the guy who wrote the V2X code that is on the HB web site.  I
just got an expansion board, and am looking into v2X and sonar on the
exp board right now.

I cannot find where there are pins for the SPI port on the expansion
board.  Yup, the breadboard area would work, and I have thought of
that.  

The SPI port is maybe overkill, so I am thinking that I'll just have
like a timed process that, say every 500msec (configurable), it takes
a heading.  Then with the extra output pins, I'll be able to disable
the compass, and send calibration signals, and resets.  I think it'll
be better.  If anyone else is working on v2x, I'd love to hear about it.
