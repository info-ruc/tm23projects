hi all,

my take on the email format issue is that nearly everything should be
handled on the client side.  in other words, write your filters to deal
with the "re's"; figure out that mail is from the handy board list by
searching for "handyboard@media.mit.edu" in the To: or cc: fields, etc.

the one thing i will insist on is that people turn off HTML formatting
when they post a message to the list.  this is for two reasons:

1.  if you don't have an HTML capable email client -- and a lot of us
do not -- it's REALLY annoying to scroll through tons of garbage to
get to the content.

2.  the archive format of the list isn't HTML friendly.

in my list guidelines, i do mention the HTML issue, and i
occasionally remind people privately when they post an HTML message. 

(i admit, the HTML thing is a pet peeve of mine -- i like my email the
old fashioned way, with monospaced formatting, *asterisks* for
emphasis, and UPPER CASE if you are really annoyed.  but as list mom i
get to have a few idosyncracies.)

thanks,
fred
