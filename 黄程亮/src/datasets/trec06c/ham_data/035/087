Most email packages automatically insert this and it is quite alot of trouble
to disable this for just one list. I usually look at the subject line and remove
multiple "RE:" manually and some email packages do this automatically, too.
I suggest that you set you filter to look at the subject line and do a "contains"
rather than 'begins with" type of compare.
