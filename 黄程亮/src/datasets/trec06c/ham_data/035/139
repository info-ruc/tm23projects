Hi All,

On Saturday, March 27, 1999, Penn State Abington College, Abington, PA
(Phila., PA (USA) region) will host a Fire-Fighting Robot Contest based on
the rules of the International Fire-Fighting Robot Contest held annually at
Trinity College.  The goal is for a mobile robot to explore a maze
consisting of 4 rooms, locate a candle, and extinguish the candle in the
minimum time. 

The Penn State Abington event is open to the public as participants and
spectators, and is free.  There will be a $150 first prize. We try to have
good time and there's always free pizza. It is a great way to prepare for
the Trinity contest in April.  Information about the contest can be found
at  http://www.ecsel.psu.edu/~avanzato/robots/contests/

Thanks

-Bob
