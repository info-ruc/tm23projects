Hi Simon,

> please send it to me, that would be nice ;)

ok I'll send you, but the function names and comments are in Portuguese...
If I have time I can translate it.

I have suggested in the list some time ago (when I was waiting for my
HandyBoard components) that people used the PC paralel port to test the
stepper motor algorithms before going to the Handy Board. But that isn't
necessary, as it's so easy to program the Handy Board. The same circuit you
connected to the paralel port can be connected to the HandyBoard, but take
care not to short circuit it and damage your HB. The appropriate connection
is shown below.

> But i dont know how to interface the HB to make the thing work :(

Well, if you want to make the same thing I did, wipe out from the sockets
your motor drivers for a while (L293?). Now if you have a protoboard,
excellent. You will place wires in the socket holes to the protoboard
matrix holes. These is a suggested connection, I'm using it in my HB:

U10:
connect pins 6 and 7 (make a little jumper)
connect pins 14 and 15
Stepper motor coil 1 output: pin 3
Stepper motor coil 2 output: pin 11

U11:
connect pins 6 and 7
connect pins 14 and 15
Stepper motor coil 3: pin 3
Stepper motor coil 4: pin 11
Ground: pin 4
5 VDC out for your circuit (don't exxagerate!): pin 16

This way you will use all your outputs, but this is only for algorithm
testing... You can use bk() and fd(). The pins connected together turns on
the red leds for you to see what's going on. (I didn't have an LCD the time
I did this, my LCD arrived some days ago but I didn't have time and
connector to place it in the HB yet). For you to use all the 8 outputs,
these should be the connections:

U10:
Output 1: pin 1
Out2: pin 2
Out3: pin 9
Out4: Pin 10

U11:
Out5: Pin 1
Out6: pin 2
Out7: Pin 9
Out8: Pin 10
GND: Pin 4
5 VDC out: pin 16
 
PLEASE REMEMBER THE FOLLOWING:
1 - The current you have in this pins is very LIMITED, you shouldn't drive
more than 15 mA, so you will have to use external drivers or transistors.
2 - If you use transistors other than TIP122 that already have a protection
diode inside it, remember to connect a diode in the reverse way as the
current flows through the coil. This will prevent your circuit from being
damaged by the reverse high voltage that the coil makes when turned off
(sorry, I don't know how to call this in English, hope you could
understand).

Connecting all the outputs this way you can't use bk() and fd(). You'll
have to write your own functions to acess the outputs (I didn't write that
yet, but as soon as I restart playing with the HB I'll make it). With those
connections the leds won't turn on, for them to blink you will have to
connect the outputs to the appropriate pins (3, 6, 11 and 14). A logic 0
turns on the led.

Hope this could help you a bit.

Best regards,
Cesar
