OK, now I too have my handy board, it's italian, not just the same, but has
a 68hc11, and all those other thinks that make it just quite the original
one similar to this. It will be interesting to see if we will can have, a
day or another, a new footbal match using boards coming from other places.
Maybe also the code written for the MIT's board is compatible with mine. I
will take care anyway to maintain pertinent
my mails to this mailing list.

Thanks
