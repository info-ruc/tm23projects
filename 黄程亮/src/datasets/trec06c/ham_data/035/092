Hi

I have been following this mailing list and the comp.robotics.misc news =
group for quite a while now and I did notice that there seems to be a =
lack of good quality and reasonably priced robot bases.

All the ones I saw where way overpriced or way to small to mount any =
real hardware

I have been thinking on starting out a small home based mail order
business providing affordable robot bases to serve the robotics =
community and would like to get some input from the readers of this news =
group to see if there is enough demand to even dream about it.

I would also like to get some feed back to see what sort of robotic base =
 majority of readers prefer.

here is some of the info I'm looking for:

base geometry: circular or rectangular/ single or double decker.
base dimensions:  9", 10" or 12" or larger
drive train configuration: differential steering or combined drive and
steering or front wheel drive rear wheel steering.
drive wheel diameter: 2.75", 3" or 3.25" or larger
base material: plastic, aluminum or fiberglass (PCB material)
accessories: turret, extra deck

Please feel free to add any other suggestions you may have.

Send all reply's to lroska@cyberus.ca

Thanks
