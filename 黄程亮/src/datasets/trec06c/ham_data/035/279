Keith,

I've succesfully connected two steppermotors from old diskdrives to the HB,
one 1.8 degrees and one even 0.9 degrees/step.
I found all the info I needed on the internet, and especially
www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm contains some useful information (not only
on stepper motors!), including IC-code to control a steppermotor with the
HB. I optimized the code found there, and was able to make 1 rotation within
a second with the 1.8 degrees/step steppermotor.
I found the main problem to be how to connect the differend wires to the
motor outputs. My 1.8 degrees motor has a brown, a black, a orange and a
yellow wire, and I connected them in this order from the RJ11 connection on
the HB down to the start button, using only motoroutputs 0 and 1, so I can
connect an other steppermotor to the outputs for motor 2 an 3. I have
SN754410 motor drivers chips, and I don't know what will happen if you use
the standard chip's.

BTW, using software to control steppermotors at a high speed uses quite a
lot of processor power. Also, you can only connect two steppermotors to your
HB this way. I think using seperate steppermotor driver IC's would be
better, but I haven't had time to test one yet :-(.
