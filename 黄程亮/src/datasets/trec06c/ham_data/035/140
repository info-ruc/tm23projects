Hello everyone,

	I have just recently received the Handyboard, and everything seems to be
working fine with the power adapter.  However, I am slightly confused by the
charging mechanism for the board.  When I connect the 8 AA Nickel-Cadmium
batteries to the board, the power seems to never turn off.   I have a
properly rated adapter (12V 500mA) plugged into the board, with power switch
on, the yellow charge light appears.  I turn the switch off, LCD remains on,
Green power light remains on, and Yellow charge light turns off.  Following
the directions from the manual, I left it to charge for about 14 hours, but
it didn't seem to work (Obviously the power seemed to remain on.)  Do these
characteristics seem to be correct when the Handyboard is turned off??

Thanks for the help,
James
