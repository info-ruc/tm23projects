I found that returning the median (middle value) of three successive
readings filters out the noisy readings quite well--especially the
occasional large error.  Just a couple nested if-then statements are
needed.

Sure, that sounds about right.

When I calibrated mine, the counts per cm ended up about 143 (maybe
because I live up in the thin air?)

There's a lot to be said for simple solutions.  The Seattle Robotics
Society web site had a great page about sonar (I don't know if it's
still there).  It described overlapping the 10-degree fields of "view"
of a couple of sonar transducers by five degrees to provide a 15-degree
field with 5-degree effective resolution.  I plan to follow their lead.=20
I'll let you all know how it turns out.  Have a blast.
