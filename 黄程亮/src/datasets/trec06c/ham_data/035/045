Hi everyone:

    Sorry for the reply latency, I was buried under an avalanche of work and
assignments.  Changing the format of the code (as detailed below) helped
immensely.  I re-wrote two of my drivers to use the increased size, and
everything is working perfectly.

I believe this is definitely something for the FAQ, as the solution is
fairly obscure, and the "yacc" keyword is best searched for.  Thanks to Max,
Regan, and Fred, for all your kind help.
