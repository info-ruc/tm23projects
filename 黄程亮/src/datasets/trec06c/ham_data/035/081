Before you do anything else, I would suggest cut to length the male headers
which interconnect with the HandyBoard, and plug them into the appropriate
sockets on the HB.  Note that the mating pins are too long to insert fully
into the sockets.  This is by design.  Fit the Exp board to the solder
tails, and solder from the top.  You may have to do some judicious bending
of the female sockets on the HB to make it line up.
