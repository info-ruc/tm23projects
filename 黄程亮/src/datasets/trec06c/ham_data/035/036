I just got a expansion board kit from Douglas Electronics and was wondering
if anyone has any tips for assembling the board,  I'm quite experienced at
building kits but I thought maybe someone who had built the kit already
might offer some advice, also, is there any instructions online?.
Thanks,
Clancy
