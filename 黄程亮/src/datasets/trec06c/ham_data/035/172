 Anyone know if there is a difference between these #s found on two different
detectors? gp1u5 81x   and  gp1u5 2x?  I dont think there is any difference
but?...
 Also, How could these be wired to individually to say, light an led that
would be a triggering signal I could use as an interface to my hc11.
Any help much obliged.
