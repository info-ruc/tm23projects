Hi!

> I have a question. Can i use stepper motors to drive my robot platform ?

I don't have any experience in robots, but I've mounted a positioning
system for a current transformer tap selector using the HandyBoard.

Stepper motors are generally strong and can keep the stopped position very
well.

You will find good 1.8 degree stepper motors in old 5 1/4 drives, generally
they are about 160 mA x 12 V. Other source of very good stepper motors are
old printers, I've found some incredibly strong ones.

Simon, please keep me in touch of your progress, I'd like to mount my first
mobile robot and I have lots of stepper motors right here... We can swap
HandyBoard code too.

Best regards,
Cesar
