I just finished my expansion board kit, it went together quite nicely
(thanks to everyone who gave me advice on its construction) but it doesn't
seat all the way down on the Handy Board because it hits the crystal which
protrudes above the the other components on the HB, is this normal or is the
crystal on my HB taller then normal?, it lack about 3/16'' of going all the
way down. Also, is there procedure for testing the expansion board?.
Thanks,
Clancy
