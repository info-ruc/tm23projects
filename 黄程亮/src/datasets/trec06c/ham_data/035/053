Hi all,
            Help, I suspect that my handy board is dead..:-(
I had it running at work and my boss pulled a battery out of the pack
while a program was running. I now have the black squares across the
top row indicating that there is no pcode or program loaded. I noticed that
the black squares used to flicker at about the same rate as the 
heart beat but now they are solid.. 

When I try to download pcode the green power led beats at the same rate 
as the SER led. After about two or maybe three seconds the LEDs go solid 
and the download program (I use icw and my boss the DOS version and
we have tried both ) reports board not responding.. About ten attempts and
nothing works...

My boss has a CRO and multimeter. What information could I 
provide to assist in working out what is wrong ?

Regards,

Regan
