You'll need slotted disks mounted on the axles positioned between the
emitter and the detector.  I recommend using ones from a dead computer
mouse.

You ought to check for wiring problems and excessive friction in the gears
and axles.  That seems like a huge difference in power settings.  Try
different pairs of motor ports, too.

I heard of such things, but don't have specifics.  Sorry.

It could be the wrong wavelength of IR, but more likely is that the
detector is expecting modulated IR (pulsed at maybe 40kHz or so to avoid
being affected by ambient radiation--e.g. sunlight).  Best of luck to you.
