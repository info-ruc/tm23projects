Hi Clancy, 
      Sounds like your HB has a full height crystal. I think a half height
one is in the specs, if you're worried about it switch it with a shorter
version. You could also use a ceramic resonator, they're shorter than the
crystal.

I rewrote Fred's hbtest.c to check the new analog and digital inputs, and I
have a short routine that lets you rotate the servos with the knob(). Let
me know if you're interested...

Best, Duncan
