Subject: shaft encoders for a track drive
Priority: normal
Message-Id:  <9902151227.aa25829@daneeka.flemingc.on.ca>

Has anybody out there constructed shaft encoders for a track driven
MOBOT. If any body has I would appreciate any help you could give me.
I wasn't going to use shaft encoders but I guess they are needed
for many things correct? Is there anyway to build encoders without 
using the led's and the colored disks? or is that the easiest way?
