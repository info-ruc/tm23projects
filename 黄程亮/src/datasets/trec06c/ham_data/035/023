Hi!

Please Fred Martin or somebody please help me on this!

I'd like to know if the MC 68HC711 E9CFN2 chip can be used with the
HandyBoard. It has 12 kB of internal EPROM, I've never seen a smd eprom
chip, but I don't need the EPROM. The case is that I can buy tons of these
microcontrollers for a bargain, much less than 10 dollars. One of the things
I want is to make some more HandyBoards to my friends here, and later I want
to use this chip on another project (using its EPROM).

Thank you a lot, and best regards.
Cesar
