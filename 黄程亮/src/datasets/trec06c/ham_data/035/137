I built a base for $50, including tools. It was made out of L-channel metal
girder. It had 2 drive motors, bought surplus, from those kid-cars ($12
apiece). There's a caster as the third wheel ($4), and I have a 12v 4a
battery ($10) plus metal ($10) and blades for my dad's hacksaw ($2). Cheap
and easy base WITH power to boot!
    Oh, and if I could put in a good word for those motors: they are
*really* nice and extremely powerful. Haven't tried it yet, but it should be
able to push a fair-sized vacuum around.......
