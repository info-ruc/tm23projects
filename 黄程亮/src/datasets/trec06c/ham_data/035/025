I got the gear sets from HVW Technologies in Canada. http://www.hvwtech.com/

The gear sets were pretty cheap when you take into account the exchange
rate - about $20 for two. They come with motors but youll have to swap them
with something else because the motors are rated at voltages below what the
H board requires. I used motors from the Gleason research motor/sensor kit
and because they were a little longer than the original motors that came
with the gear set, I fabricated small spacers out of some copper tubing.
Otherwise, the new motors line up fine.

Good luck!!
