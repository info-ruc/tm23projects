I recommend saving up your milk money and buying a pre-assembled, tested HandyBoard.  Sure, it costs a little more, but for me (electronics moron that I am) it was worth it.

I bought mine from Patrick Hui at the Robot Store in Hong Kong.  I can assure you that Mr. Hui is competent and helpful and a really nice guy.  I later added a NiCd battery pack and the resettable thermistor fuse (F1), since neither was included with the HB that I purchased.  Check the HB web site for information.
