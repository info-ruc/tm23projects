   What is the best way to manually etch the handy board, i've etched it 
by passing the circuit layout through the printer 3 times then ironing 
it on to the copper board.  This works well but some traces bleed 
together. I have access to a PCB repair lab so I am fixing this one 
unless someone has a better idea.

Thank You
