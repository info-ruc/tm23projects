You can get some from old printers or scanners but I think they are rated
for 24V

For Eurobot 97 ,some robots were using stepper motors. On Internet, there
was also a guy who explained how to build a robot from a floppy drive. 
As far as I know, you can't vary the speed too fast. You have to create a
kind of ramp function to slowly increase it otherwise your motor may stall
and you will loose count.
