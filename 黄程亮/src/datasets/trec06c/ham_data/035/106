I bought a "Rising Bird Turbo 7" radio controlled car, ripped out the
receiver
electronics, hooked up 12 rectifier diodes to the motor and a 1W, 10 ohm
resistor to
the steering electromagnet and bolted a piece of very light wood to the
chassis and the handy board
to the wood. Worked quite well and looked very sexy, (in my humble
opinion)..
My boss was giving me ideas about the electronics..

    Subject: Robot base


    Hi

    I have been following this mailing list and the comp.robotics.misc news
group for quite a while now and I did notice that there seems to be a lack
of good quality and reasonably priced robot bases.

    All the ones I saw where way overpriced or way to small to mount any
real hardware

    I have been thinking on starting out a small home based mail order
    business providing affordable robot bases to serve the robotics
community and would like to get some input from the readers of this news
group to see if there is enough demand to even dream about it.

    I would also like to get some feed back to see what sort of robotic base
majority of readers prefer.

    here is some of the info I'm looking for:

    base geometry: circular or rectangular/ single or double decker.
    base dimensions:  9", 10" or 12" or larger
    drive train configuration: differential steering or combined drive and
    steering or front wheel drive rear wheel steering.
    drive wheel diameter: 2.75", 3" or 3.25" or larger
    base material: plastic, aluminum or fiberglass (PCB material)
    accessories: turret, extra deck

    Please feel free to add any other suggestions you may have.

    Send all reply's to lroska@cyberus.ca

    Thanks
