The EPROM is probably disables with a setting in the config register.

If folks are looking for cheap 68HC11A1FN's, I was able to get 'em for
about $5 each, and they came with a bunch of other electronics, and 2
motors.  Turns out Connor disk drives used this chip for a while. A
local surplus store had "dead" drives for $5 each. If you are careful,
the chip comes off pretty easy using a dremel, and soldering iron. Not
sure what to do with the rest of the parts though :-).
