Hi,

I have a question. Can i use stepper motors to drive my robot platform ?

Do i need a gear ?
I'd like to use stepper motors instead of normal ones, because I would
not need any shaft encoders.
And I think stepper motors do not cause so much noise like normal
motors.
If someone have a idea where (old floppys,etc.) to rip out good (12V/1A)
stepper motors, please mail me.
Does someone use stepper motors to drive a robot ?
Are there any arguments against using stepper motors to drive ?


Thank You in advance.

Simon
