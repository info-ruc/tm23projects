The Vertical Sync Test is actually the most demanding thing that exists 
because it blits whole video screens of diagnostics as often as it 
can.  The Tachistoscopic Acid Test on the other hand merely blits the 
region of the screen that is changing, the text and the immediate area 
around it.  The Tachistoscopic Acid Test is designed to behave as DMDX 
would under it's most demanding situations whereas the Vertical Sync Test 
is testing whether we can sync with the video card and unfortunately the 
amount of diagnostic spew it makes presents a bit of a strain on some 
machines, it's not designed to behave like DMDX does.  That is why DMDX 
executes just fine, it is closer to the Tachistoscopic Acid Test in 
execution.  The Vertical Sync Test would have to be de-tuned quite a bit to 
get it down to normal loads and I haven't bothered to do it because of all 
the users you are the only one to have ever noticed -- and it would 
interfere with the test. So it stands as is.  I spent quite some time 
tracking down what was happening there and watching the machines around 
here that reported unusually long sleep times (it's not uncommon) and 
finally figured out what's happening and it's non issue.  You can use test 
modes 2, 3 and 4 to monitor what's happening as DMDX runs but I'll bet 
they're fine as you see the Tachistoscopic Acid Test is just fine.
