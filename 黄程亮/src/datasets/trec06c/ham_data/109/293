From your description, it appears that you also want the image to be
response contingent.
See the two Visual lexical decision task sample item-files (and timing
notes) on this webpage
http://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu/methods/DMDX/SampleScripts/SampleScripts.htm

The first item file is not response contingent (i.e., the text is up for 30
ticks every trial regardless of response speed).  The second item file uses
<clfd> and <fbd> to make the text remain on the screen until (but only
until) the participant responds
