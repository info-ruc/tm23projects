   Almost nothing as far as DMDX is concerned, I always thought two ticks 
was a ridiculously long time myself but given that DMDX doesn't check where 
it is in the previous retrace two ticks is pretty much the minimum if you 
don't want stress things.  Something else on your machine is probably 
chewing up oodles of execution time.
