Hi All!

The final set of notes (for diving) has now been posted under Course Documents in the folder where all of my other notes are placed.  We will cover these notes on Friday of this week.  John will finish his lectures on Hypoxia on Wednesday (tomorrow).  Remember....another riviting session of late-night presentations tomorrow!
