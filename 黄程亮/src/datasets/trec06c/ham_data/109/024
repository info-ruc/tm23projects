There seem to be a number of students who did not submit a book review before the deadline on Tuesday, Nov. 8. Please check your grades on Blackboard, and if you do not have an ! mark next to the book review assignment, and you do not have permission to turn in your paper late, it means we did not receive your book review. If you submitted one, and we didn't get it, that means that you did not correctly follow the instructions for submitting your book review. If you have proof (written - you can show through your computer records) that you submitted your book review on time, we will accept your book review. However, if you have no proof that it was submitted, we will not accept your book review unless you are one of the students who received written permission from me to submit the report late.
