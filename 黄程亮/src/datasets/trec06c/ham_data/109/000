Hellos,

Does anyone have DMDX scripts for (1) a finger tapping
or (2) Stroop tests which they would like to share?

For my part I have well developed DMDX scripts for the
PASAT (Paced Serial Addition Test - in English,
Swedish, and Italian no less!) and Posner's Covert
Orienting of Attention paradigm ... which I would
likewise be happy to share.

Warmest regards,

Derek Eder
