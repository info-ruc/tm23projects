Hello,

I am trying to get my program to display a picture until it detects a
vocal response.  Then, the screen should clear and move on.  Or, if
there is no response after 2 seconds, it should clear and move on. 
Also, it should record the reaction time from when the picture is
displayed to when the vocal response is detected.

As it stands now, I can only get it to display the picture until it
detects a vocal response (but the reaction times all come out as 1.00
in the azk file) OR I can get it to record the reaction times in ms
but it just displays the picture for 2 seconds no matter what.

Here is some of the script where it displays the picture until it
detects voice, but the reaction times all read 1.00 in the azk:

<ep> <ntl><d 0><cr><id digitalVOX><id RecordVocal 0, 2000><id
keyboard><wc 000255000> <dbc 000000000><dfs 36><vm
1024,768,768,16,75><ClearFeedback><eop>

+1111 g"+2" <% 75> / <bmp> * "picture1";
0 <ms% 2000> /c;
+1112 g"+2" <% 75> / <bmp> * "picture2";
0 <ms% 2000> /c;

Here is some of the script where it displays the picture for 2 seconds
irrespective of when it picks up the vocal response but it records
different reaction times in ms in the azk file:

<ep><fd 160><d 79><cr><t 1990><id digitalVOX><id RecordVocal 0,
2000><id keyboard><wc 000255000> <dbc 000000000><dfs 36><vm
1024,768,768,16,75><nfb><eop>

+1111 g"+2" <% 75> / * g"picture1" / !;
0 <ms% 2000> /c;
+1112 g"+2" <% 75> / * g"picture2" / !;
0 <ms% 2000> /c;

Can someone please help me?

Thanks,
Jillian Lee
