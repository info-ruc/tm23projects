Hi,

We are still having trouble making TimeDX work properly with
Windows XP. On some machines everything seems to work fine, on
others it doesn't and sometimes it depends on the videomode.

The latest discovery is that things can fail in the vertical retrace sync test,
but then are fine when we do the tachistiscopic acid test.

The problem in the vertical retrace test (or 'Time video mode' test) is that
the reported sleep times are often much longer than the requested sleep
time, resulting in many timeouts and multiply timeouts. These things
son't happen at all in the acid test, even with demanding settings.

Aren't the vertical retrace test and the tachistiscopic acid test supposed
to use the same underlying code? And isn't the latter supposed to be more
demanding? These results are a bit puzzling and seem to indicate that the
vertical retrace test isn't working correctly.

Another reason to think that this is the case is the fact that no problems
have been reported yet for that specific machine when using DMDX.

Maarten
