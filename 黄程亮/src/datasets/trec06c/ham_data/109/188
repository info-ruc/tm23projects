Thanks for the info. The computer I am running this script on is my persona=
l
notebook that I dont use for data collection. I guess there could be a lot
of things wrong with it (such as old drivers, crappy notebook video card,
etc). Out of curiosity, what processes occur during those two ticks between
item preparation and the actual display (might help me to understand what
the culprit is on this notebook to satisfy my need to understand this).
