Hi Derek (and other DMDX users),
I am teaching a short grad course on DMDX scripting right now. As part of
that course, the students and I are putting together a website with scripts
that demonstrate various features of DMDX (much like some of the scripts on
Mike Ford's website). We also intend to start to archive full scripts for a=
n
array of common tasks/paradigms. Just started teaching the course two weeks
ago so the site is kinda fresh right now. You can view it at
http://dionysus.psych.wisc.edu/methods/DMDX/DMDXHelp.htm
 I would love to add scripts from others and will accept them via email (at
jjcurtin@wisc.edu). Ideally, they should be commented to indicate function
and details about the task, timing, number of trials, etc. These will
hopefully serve as nice starting points for similar script development.
 I intend to keep this site public accessible and hope to improve on it
during the class and afterwards to serve as a resource for everyone using
DMDX. Always willing to take suggestions for helpful content as well.
 Derek, I do have a couple of Stroop scripts (generic, and one based on the
Carter et al, trial type frequency manipulation). I will send this in an
email to you directly.
 Best, John
