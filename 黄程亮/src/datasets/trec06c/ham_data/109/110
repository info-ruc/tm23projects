Hey everyone!

The presentations will be held in room 175 of Lillis.  We will get started at 6, with pizza arriving at 5:45 and with groups who are presenting needing to get there early to make sure everything gets loaded up correctly.  

I posted the missing overhead in Course Documents.  John will get his overheads posted soon.  Have a great week and weekend!
