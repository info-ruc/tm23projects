Hi everyone,

I regret to inform you that I have been shut down in terms of supplying food for tonight.  The University will not allow us to order food from off-campus, and we are not allowed to have food in the classrooms of Lillis.  So...make sure you come with a full belly...and I am really sorry that this is the case.  

Chris
