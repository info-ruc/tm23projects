Enter the Pepsi "Maxed Out Mazda RX-8" Sweeps
	
Hey Valdo,
	
I just entered this awesome new sweeps from Pepsi Street Motion. They're giving away a full-blown custom Mazda RX8 tricked out by Vivid Racing. It's one of the wildest imports I've ever seen.
	
You should enter too. And if you win, you owe me. Big. Let me take the whip around the block once or twice and we'll call it even.
