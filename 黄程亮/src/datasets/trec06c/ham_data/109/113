Hi,

I'm trying to run a simple repetition priming experiment in
American Sign Language. For that, I need to present a prime
video and a target video. I constructed the script file
beforehand, based on a previous one I had, just modifying the
relevant parts.

I tested the script with some dummy videos I had. It worked.

When I got my first actual videos (i.e., the ones I would be
using for the experiment), I ran a couple on TimeDX test mode,
and everything was displayed correctly.

But when I tried to run the script with the full list of
materials, DMDX crashed immediately, whether I was checking
the syntax or trying to run it directly.

I tried reducing the number of items in my list, thinking that
it might be a memory issue. Instead, I found out that the
problem is not the number of items, but simply that some trial
lines will make DMDX invariably crash, while others won't.

I really don't get it, since all the trial lines are all
identical, just the name of the files are different. And to
make things worse, if I run the problematic files on TimeDX or
in a separate script that just displays them, everything works
out fine.

Has anyone ran into a similar problem? Any ideas of what the
problem might be?

I'm using AVI files, btw. I know the computer is a Pentium 4
with 1GB RAM, but I don't remember the video card specs from
the top of my head (I'm at home right now, which is also the
reason I can't send my script code on this mail).

I can post the correct specs and the script code first thing
in the morning, if necessary.

Thanks in advance for any help.

best,
Diogo
