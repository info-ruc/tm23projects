From: Mrs. Rachael Stewart.
#23 Les Caches,St.
Martins, Guernsey,Channel Islands,
United Kingdom. 
Atention ;
I am the above named person but now undergoing medical
treatment in London, England. I am married to Dr.
Richard Stewart. who worked with British Railway
Commission in Chelsea England for over a decade before 
he died on 5th of July in the year 2003.
We were married for fifteen years without a child. He
died after a brief illness that lasted for two weeks.
Before his death he made a vow to use his wealth for
the down trodden and the less privileged in the
society.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or
get a child outside my matrimonial home.
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of
(Eighteen Million US Dollars) with one Finance House. 
Presently, this money is still with the Finance House.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for
the next 150 days due to cancer problem. Though what
disturbs me most is my stroke.
Having known my condition I decided to donate this 
fund to an individual or better still a God fearing
person who will utilize this money the way I am going
to instruct here in.
I want an individual that will use this to fund and
provide succor to poor and indigent persons, 
orphanages, and widows and for propagating peace in
the universe.
I understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I
took this decision because I do not have any child
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives 
are not inclined to helping poor persons and I do not
want my husbands hard earned money to be misused or
spent in the manner in which my late husband did not
specify.
I do not want a situation where this money will be 
used in an ungodly manner, hence the reason for taking
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I
know where I am going.I know that I am going to be in
the bossom of the Almighty.
I do not need any telephone communication in this 
regard because of my health and because of the
presence of my husband?s relatives around me always.
I do not want them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive
your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance
House.
I will also issue you a letter of authority that will
empower you as the original beneficiary of this fund.
I want you to always pray for me. My happiness is that 
I lived a life worthy of emulation. Whosoever that
wants to serve the Almighty must serve him with all
his heart and mind and always be prayerful all through
your life.
Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing 
for an individual for this same purpose. Please assure
me that you will act according to specification
herein. Hoping to hear from you.
Thank you and May the Almighty God bless you.
Yours sincerely
Mrs. Rachael Stewart. (Benefactor).
