Thanks for your replies. But when we run the above lines, with <nfb> and <cr>
added, we found another problem.

Now "circle" and "cross" are a set of sequential stimuli. But "cross" will not
be displayed unless a response is made after the presentation of "circle". That
is, "cross" displays only after a response is made for "circle". So we cannot
manipulate the ISI between "circle" and "cross". What we want to achieve is to
manipulate the ISI, such as 10ms, 50ms, etc. Could you give us some
recommendation? Thanks.
