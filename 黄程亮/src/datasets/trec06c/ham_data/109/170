No fees, no travel, you're invited! From December 5th through December 9th,
CGAP and *MicroSave* are sponsoring a virtual conference on savings
mobilization. Facilitated by Madeline Hirschland, senior managers from
leading financial institutions including FinComun, Equity Bank, and *Safe*S=
ave
will discuss their experience serving small depositors. You are invited to
simply listen in or to contribute your own experience with deposit
mobilization. Entitled "Serving Small Depositors: Meeting Demand While
Managing Costs", the conference will focus on the following questions:

=B7 What are the keys to managing the costs of deposit mobilization?

=B7 What mix of products can an institution offer to attract the balance of
low-cost stable funds that it needs?

=B7 What delivery options (such as mobile vehicles, mobile phone banking,
deposit collectors or satellite offices) are the most effective means to
bring services close enough to poor and rural depositors?

=B7 What types of marketing will most effectively inspire depositors to tru=
st
and deposit their savings with our institutions?

=B7 What types of external factors (regulatory frameworks, payment systems,
supervisory bodies, technical assistance, liquidity management mechanisms,
etc.) are most helpful to financial institutions that have or seek to
develop deposit services?

To register for the conference, simply send a blank e-mail to:

savingsconference-subscribe@yahoogroups.com

Ten participants in the conference will receive a free copy of the
just-released book, *Savings Services for the Poor: An Operational Guide*,
written by experts in the field. We look forward to your joining us.
