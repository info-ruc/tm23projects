It is important for my experiment to display text in certain color (or
grayscale). I am using WYSIWYG formatting of my stimuli.

Problem 1: Sometimes, instead of displaying the text in, say, gray (as
it is formatted), it is displayed in black.

Problem 2: the display location is also important. Sometimes the text
is not displayed in the right location (e.g., when it should be
displayed a bit to the left (of fixation) it is displayed too far to
the left).

I have prepared a demo script, please let me know if and where you
want me to send it.

Thanks again,
-Yuval.

PS: Font size problem is solved (for my purposes), thanks!
