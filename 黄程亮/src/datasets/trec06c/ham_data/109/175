Hi,

I am writing a program for a simple reaction time task. In the
experiment,participant would be instructed to depress a button(home
button) until a signal is presented, then the participant need to
leave-off the home button and move his hand to depress the another
button(response button).

The problem is that, i would like to use DMDX to count the RT of
leaving off the button and at the same time the RT of pressing the
button in one trial. How to use DMDX to do that?

Thanks,
Kevin
