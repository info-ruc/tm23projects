   Cheap laptops and running DMDX recording speech would be mutually 
exclusive terms.  If you want any chance of recording speech in DMDX on a 
laptop you are going to have to buy a gaming machine, one that is sold as 
being good for playing games on.  Then it MIGHT have a decent audio device 
that MIGHT have drivers that function nicely that you MIGHT be able to get 
working with DMDX.  Dell Inspirons are my recommendation.
