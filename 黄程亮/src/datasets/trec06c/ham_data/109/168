Dear all,=20
We have recently updated our computers (from Windows 2000 to XP, =
updating of
DirectX and DMDX) and I have problems with DMDX when doing a self-paced
reading (but none with a simple visual lexical decision paradigm).
The following script used to work before, but now we have the infamous
"display error" on each word, although we have <d 20>, although the =
refresh
rate is the same as before (11,7ms). After 20 or so sentences, Windows =
XP
crash and the computer needs to be restarted.
-> Do you have any clues why it is so?=20
To avoid these display errors, I tried to increase the delay up to 60 =
ticks,
but it remained the same. Finally, I set the delay to -20, that is <d =
-20>,
so that DMDX anticipates the next trial. This time, no display error
occurred. However, the reading times, measured after each word, are very
strange, being as low as 0.7ms (which never happened before). This is =
not
due to speedy behaviour, because participants respond accurately on =
trials
where they present such behaviour.
-> Does the <d -20> mean that I need to add 20 ticks to my measured RT,
namely adding 20*11.7 to 0.7ms?=20
Your help would be very helpful.=20
Here is an example of my script, with one sentence.=20
