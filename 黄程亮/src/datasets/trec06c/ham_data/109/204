There's a whole slew of RecordVocal and DigitalVox issues that produce 
exactly the symptoms you describe and that have described by me in great 
lengths in the past, the finer details of which I never remember.  Check 
the help on RecordVocal and the archives and you should find all the 
information you need, it's all I'd be doing in any event.

   The voice key is probably triggering correctly however the data that is 
being written out is likely to be out of phase however.

   It's an audio driver and operating system issue.

"There are those who claim that magic is like the tide; that it swells
and fades over the surface of the earth, collecting in concentrated
pools here and there, almost disappearing from other spots, leaving
them parched for wonder.  There are also those who believe that if you
stick your fingers up your nose and blow, it will increase your
intelligence."
