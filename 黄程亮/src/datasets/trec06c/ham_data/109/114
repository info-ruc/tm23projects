   DMDX does a few things differently to TimeDX so it's possible that some 
evil encoding scheme might work with TimeDX but tosses DMDX for a loop.

   Not that I've heard of.  Other problems, yes (invariably the result of 
some evil video codec) but not quite like you're describing.  You might try 
<SafeMode 1> in the parameter line and see if that clears things up -- but 
I'm not holding my breath.

   I'm guessing you'll have to post a section of your item file and we'll 
see if there's anything odd with it.
