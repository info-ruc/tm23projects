Dear all,

I am coming back to you because adding "-buffers 4" didn't help at all. Our
128Mo video card is INTEL 829156/GV/910GL Express Chipset Family.

With d 20: DMDX crashes
With d 0: many display errors
With d -20: no display errors but weird RTs (0.7ms)

I am sorry to bother you, but we are incapable of finding a solution. Plus,
we would like to know whether measured RTs are accurate with d -20, because
they are sometimes dramatically low.

Claire Delle Luche

   You need new video drivers or you need to used one of the shortcuts that
limits how hard DMDX presses the video card drivers, "DMDX for GeForce Video
Cards" or "DMDX for Really Bad Video Cards".
