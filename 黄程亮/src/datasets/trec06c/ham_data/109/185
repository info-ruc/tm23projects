Why does DMDX occasionally produce display errors when using a delay of 0?
If a delay of 0 means "get the display up as quickly as possible, the delay
being determined by how long it takes DMDX to prepare the item", then it
doesnt seem to make sense that a display error could occur. When these
errors occur they seem to always be 1 tick delayed (which in the script I a=
m
writing is about 10% of items that load a bmp which has previously been
loaded using medialife)
