   Various people have expressed a desire to do so throughout history, a 
number have even made tutorials (that we are thoroughly thankful for) and 
that are linked to from the DMDX Updates page.  However a comprehensive 
work is a truly staggering amount of work and anyone that seriously 
investigates writing a manual for DMDX soon finds that out.  There's a 
reason why the profession of technical writer exists and alas none of us 
are a member of it.  So it hasn't happened.

Associate with well-mannered persons and your manners will improve.
Run with decent folk and your own decent instincts will be
strengthened.  Keep the company of bums and you will become a bum.
Hang around with rich people and you will end by picking up the check
and dying broke.
