Thanks Jonathan, that makes things clearer. I was under the impression that the
acid test was less of a load than the retrace test, but if things are 
the other way
around it makes perfect sense again. Certainly now that you''ve told 
us that these
long sleep times are not uncommon and nothing to worry about.

I'll just run the acid test from now on, and if that one runs fine 
I'll stop worrying.

Thanks again,

Maarten
