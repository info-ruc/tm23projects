Thank for your quick reply. However, we still do not quite understandthe use of <delay>. When we write a program like this:

<ep> <s 1>  <id "Áä½L"><dbc 0> <dwc 000255000> <vm 1024 768 768 16 0><delay 0> <eop>
$0 "instructions"<umr> <mr "+Space"><umpr> <umnr> <mpr "+A"> <bu 1000>;~1 <bi 4, lastXT .gt. 0>;~2 <bi 5, lastXT .eq. -4000>;3 <delay 3> "wrong" <return>;4 <delay 3> "correct" <return>;5 <delay 3> "too long" <return>;~1000;$+1001 <ms% 75> "circle" * <call 1>/<mpr "+A"><mnr "+L"> ;+2001 <ms% 75> "cross" * <call 1>/<mpr "+A"><mnr "+L> ;
$0 "The End. Thank You.";$
Under this program, the subject will see a word "circle" flash on thescreen first. If he press "A", a feedback "correct" with a RT isshown. However, the next stimulus will not be shown automatically. Thesubject need to press spacebar twice in order to make the nextstimulus appear. It seem that this program is far from our intention.We would like to make a experiment that shows two stimuli sequentiallywith ISI varied from 10ms to 500ms. While the subject need to press 2buttons in correct order so as to get a correct in each trial. Yet, wedon't know how <delay> and <bu> help us to attain these requirments. Although we have read about these 2 commands in the DMDX help website,we still not very understand. May you explain more?
Thank
