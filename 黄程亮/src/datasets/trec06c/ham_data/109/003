What amazed me, when I started with DMDX not too long ago, was that
nobody had produced an easy way for a non-technical user to create
scripts, or modify basic scripts for their own purposes (please let me
know if I'm wrong !).
What I've ended up doing is creating a document template in WORD, using
tables, which set out all the basic commands in 'greyed out' columns,
leaving all the bits the user needs to fill in (e.g. text, file names,
etc) in white columns.  I then change all the commands as necessary
before handing over to the user to do the mundane stuff !

P.S. of course once the template is produced, you need to use WORDPAD to
do the editing !
