Hi,
I have just posted the 3rd set of altitude notes on blackboard.  We will most likely get to them tomorrow.  I apologize for taking so long to post them, but I was out of commission that last few days thanks to a cold.  How is it that we can know so much about how the human body works, and still be shut down by a little bundle of DNA that is too small to even see?
