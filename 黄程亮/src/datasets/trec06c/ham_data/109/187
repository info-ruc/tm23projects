   DMDX when presented with a delay of zero prepares the item and then 
schedules it two ticks in the future.  Patently something on your machine 
is way slower than I ever anticipated.

"There are those who claim that magic is like the tide; that it swells
and fades over the surface of the earth, collecting in concentrated
pools here and there, almost disappearing from other spots, leaving
them parched for wonder.  There are also those who believe that if you
stick your fingers up your nose and blow, it will increase your
intelligence."
