All of the book reviews that were turned in have been graded. They are available to be picked up from 175 ED. The book reviews are in a green plastic bin on the file cabinet under the faculty mailboxes.

Book reviews will be available to be picked up until the end of finals week (Dec. 9).  After that, any unclaimed book reviews will be shredded.
