Hi,

I've been having problems with DMDX playing sound files since my 
computer crashed.  The files themselves work fine on other applications, 
and have not been moved.  DMDX will still run, and .bmp files are fine, 
but the sound files can't be heard.  Is there a volume control specific 
to DMDX that could have been affected, or could this be a problem with 
it using the .wav files at all?

Thanks,
Lucy
