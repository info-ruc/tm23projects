Windows doesn't use the middle button to speak of so a legacy device like 
that won't be exposing it's middle button without specific drivers for that 
mouse.  If you want more than two buttons a USB gamepad is a good way to 
go.  There are also speciality keyboards I've seen on the web if you're not 
interested in accurate RTs.  I've also fabricated button boxes that plug 
into PIO cards -- but I'm not cheap, quite the opposite in fact.
