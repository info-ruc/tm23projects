Thanks for your help. We understand that it seem impossible to give
feedback in our experiement. So we give up trying yo give feedback and
use <ZillionResponses>

we write the program like this:

<ep> <s 1> <zil> <id "keyboard"><dbc 0> <dwc 000255000>
  <vm 1024 768 768 16 0> <delay 0> <vzk "+A"> <vzk "+L"> <eop>
$
0 "instructions"<umr> <mr "+Space"><umpr> <umnr> <mpr "+A"> <mnr "+L">;
$
+1001 <ms% 75> "circle" * /<ms% 500> <bmp> "blank"/ <ms% 75> "cross"  ;
+1002 <ms% 75> "circle" * /<ms% 500> <bmp> "blank"/ <ms% 75> "cross"  ;
$
0 "The End. Thank You.";
$

it is useful as we can vary the ISI and collect 2 response time. Yet,
at the end of each trial, we need to press space bar so as to go to
the next trial. Can we write a programme that the next trial
automatically shows up after pressing the response keys which is A & L
in this programme but not space bar?

Thanks
