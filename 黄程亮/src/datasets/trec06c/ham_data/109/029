Dear Hui Yui Chi,

Desktop computer DMDX applications use a digital
signal input/output card generally referred to as the
"PIO".  See "input" section of DMDX help.

As a laptop user, you don't have this option (unless
you have one of those Toshiba laptops from the 1980's 
that had an ISA slot ... oh yes, and a DMDX that runs
on DOS :)  

Solution?

I would use the laptop's sound "card" as an output
"port" for "sending" "digital" control signals. 
Simply speaking, when you want to trigger the light
box, you instruct DMDX to "play" a sound.  

You will have to determine the appropriate trigger
signal for the light box and construct an interface. 
It is possible that the sound card could trigger a TTL
level device directly (i.e., you might only need a
cable).

If you wanted the light box to flash at, for example,
6 (or 600) times per second for 1 minute, you can
create a "sound" file with the corresponding
"frequency" of triggers.

I use the open source (free!) sound-editor program
Audacity (http://audacity.sourceforge.net/) for this
very purpose.  Audacity even comes in a Chinese
version.

Feel free to contact me privately if I can help you
further.

Best regards,

Derek Eder
