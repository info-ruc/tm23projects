Subject: Plan 9 beginner's questions
Reply-To: vhs@qb.rhein-main.de

Maybe you can answer a few beginner's questions I have:
	What is the equivalent of 'shutdown', 'halt', 'sync' in Plan9, i.e.
		how to safely shut the system down
	What are the equivalents of ^C, ^Q and ^S under 8.5, i.e.
		how to cancel a process without deleting it's
		window, and how to stop and resume text output?

Any help, even pointers into TFM appreciated. (IRTFM'ed, but not the whole  
M ;-)

	Volker
