If I remember correctly there was a discussion on this newsgroup 
concerning Creationism not long ago.  I think that someone asked for 
books supporting Creationism.  While the person knew of several oposed to 
Creationism, he or she wasn't aware of any supporting.  Here's one in 
favor of Creationism:

	_Genesis and the Big Bang_
	by Gerald L. Schroeder

	Schroeder is a physicist and addresses the creation of the 
universe and the primary origin of life in this book.  He is Jewish and 
also has a few interesting things to say about some commentaries of th Old 
Testament.
	I also have a few technical articles that address the primary 
origin of life.  Mainly these deal with the chemistry and thermodynamics 
of Evolution and describe why Evolution is a poor explanation of the 
primary origin of life.  If anyone is interested I'll be glad to send the 
references, but I wouldn't recommend most to those that don't have a good 
background in organic chemistry.

Here's the book I said was a "must-read" for anyone interested in the
creationist:evolutionist debate:

Science Held Hostage: What's Wrong with Creation Science AND Evolutionism
Howard J. Van Till/Davis A. Young/Clarence Menninga      ISBN 0-8308-1253-9
Calvin Center for Christian Scholarship 1988, InterVarsity Press

Besides discussing the basic suppositions of the debate, the book takes
a detailed look at several case studies, including the shrinking of the
sun, the dust on the moon, salt levels in the ocean, the rock layers
in the Grand Canyon, and critiques PW Atkins The Creation and Carl Sagan's
Cosmos series.  Most importantly, it examines the limits of what science
can and cannot prove.
