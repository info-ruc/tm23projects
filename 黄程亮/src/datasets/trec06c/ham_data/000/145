Oops ... just a bit late, but others may be interested in this information.

Actually, there tends to be a continual stream of articles in the general
area -- not so much creation vs. evolution, but recent articles I recall
included critiques of Philip Johnson's book _Darwin_On_Trial_, discussions
of flood geology, and other things that were way over my head.  

Incidentally, the Journal of the ASA changed its name a few years back
and is now known as "Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith"
or just "Perspectives".

ASA also puts out a booklet called "Teaching Science in a Climate of
Controversy", designed to be used as a supplement to high school courses
on evolution.  The point of the booklet is mainly that there are advocates
at both extremes of the controversy who are apt to practice bad science,
and that one must look critically at all claims in the field, regardless
of which position they advocate.
