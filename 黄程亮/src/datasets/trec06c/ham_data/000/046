    I don't mean to stir a hornets nest here, but it's my impression that
    there's no copyright protection for screen-bitmap fonts. Of course,
    that doesn't mean that omitting a distribution notice in this case is
    the Right Thing to do...

I was under the impression that this is the case in the USA --
screen-bitmap fonts are not protected -- but in Great Britian it's
a different matter.  I'm not sure of their status in Australia.
Adding a NOTICE is definitely a Good Idea(TM) and I have written to
Mr Charles A. Bigelow asking for permission to distribute the fonts.
