Hi 9'ers,
 my question is of the pc installation. We've
always used the original 1.44 floppy. In
"Configuring for a PC", it is discussed a way
to copy the boot files to a disk to use as the
boot disk. DOS doesn't like the AUX directory
in /386/bin. Even if the files are zipped, then
expanded into DOS, it refuses to create or 
maintain this directory. How have others got 
around this? Similarly, one may copy the image 
(pcdisk) to a floppy, but of what utility is this?
  Thanks in advance, --Jerry
