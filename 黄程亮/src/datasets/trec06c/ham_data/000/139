subject: scsi driver, small bits & pieces

i have an Ultrastor 14F driver for the cpu/terminal kernel.
i've been using it fairly heavily for a few months; it seems
all right, at least with discs and CDROM.  i've also got
a variant for the Adaptec 1542B/Bustek 542B, but i haven't
used it much.

if anyone would like it/them, please let me know.

i've got a few minor changes that might be of interest:
	16550A support in devuart.c and hayes.c (seems to work).
	changes to devvga.c, aux/vga and /lib/vgadb to
		give minimal support for (my) S3/911 card in
		1024x768 mode.  it doesn't use the accelerator,
		and still needs tuning, but if anyone else wants
		to help fiddle with it, let me know.
