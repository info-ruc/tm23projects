Greetings all.  This is a mass acknowledgement to everyone who has
signed on to the plan9-fans list to date, now that influx has slowed
down a bit.  (There are 75 people on the list right now.)

One person has suggested that the name of the list be changed to
9fans.  There's already an alias for that, in any event.

The list is not being archived (that I know of).  If someone wants to
do it, that would be great.

-- Scott
