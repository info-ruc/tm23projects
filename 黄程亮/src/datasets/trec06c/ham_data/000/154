Hi 9'ers,
 have there been other modifications to plan9, besides that long
list from Rob Pike & the ALEF changes from Phil Winterbottom, that
have been released by AT&T? Specifically, for the compilers or mail?
ALSO, can someone explain what is required for us to have our
"point of contact" changed, please? TIA, --Jerry
