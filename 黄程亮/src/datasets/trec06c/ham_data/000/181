subject: optical storage

i've been experimenting with the plan 9 file server's dump system
using the pseudo-worm on some scsi discs.
it's invaluable (and good for demonstrations).
i'd like to know how much it would cost to upgrade
to provide file service on optical disc.
the users currently have about 2 to 3 Gb of data.

which optical drives (especially jukeboxes) have people
tried with plan 9, and how much do they cost?
ideally, i'd like one that stores more than 1Gb per platter
and 11Gb per jukebox, to allow for expansion,
but i'd be interested in any and all answers!
