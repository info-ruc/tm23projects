Three things for your general edification/amusement:

For those interested, there is a program called 9x in
ftp.cs.su.oz.au:/matty which provides a remote graphical connection
to a Plan 9 machine on an X terminal.  The code needs to be cleaned up
(please don't look at it too much if you get it -- I will be mortified
if you do), and it doesn't support the polysegment primitive as yet,
but it's useful if you can get it to work nevertheless.  You will
need the libXg library from research.att.com (the one with the sam
distribution) to build it.

Secondly, on the same site in /matty/unicode, there are utf versions
of libXg which will, when compiled with sam enable it to edit utf
encoded files, i.e, files containing Runes encoded as Plan 9 encodes
them using the utf-2 encoding.  The libXg and libframe libraries are
both needed as well as the font archive.

There is also a program 9term which may be used a replacement for
xterm and which provides a 8.5 (8 1/2) like window for Unix: editable
command line and output, cut/snarf/send, and if you compile with the
right libraries, utf facilities.  This is fairly stable.  It only
works on a few systems at present so if you port it please tell me.
It's still a beta version but that's probably because I'm lazy and
haven't done a last touch up more than anything else.  I've not
used xterm in any major fashion since last October or so and having
the Plan 9 `look and feel' under Unix is a big win (plug, plug!).
The current version in the directory is 1.1.1 but 1.2 should be there
in the next few days.

					Matty.
