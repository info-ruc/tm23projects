I don't have RFC821 in front of me, but (unless I'm confused) it
indicates that the SMTP envelope address may be different than the
sender's address (and the sender's address is where one would
presumably want a reply to go).  The example that the RFC cites is a
special mailbox where errors are to be sent could be used as the
envelope address (e.g. the mailing list administrator's address).

I think that your sysadmins are right: the UA should reply to the From: 
address stored within the message.  I think that RFC821 specifies other 
headers that can be used, too, such as Reply-To:.

Regards,
Neil
