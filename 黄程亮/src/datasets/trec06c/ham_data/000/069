Subject: Ported U*ix programs to Plan 9?


Is there someone, somewhere who has ported a U*ix program to Plan 9.
I'm sure there is, so I wonder where I can get more information about
these ports.

We haven't got our system running yet - we'll try on wednesday - so I
don't really know if it's even interesting to port any programs! 

(Wouldn't it be nice to have Emacs on your system... :-)

Actually I had in mind something for managing mail and News.
Impossible?

Regards,
Homann
