Subject: libXg and caps lock on Sun type V keyboard under openwindows

Not sure which of these lists (9fans or sam-fans) is more appropriate, but
here goes:

Running 9term or samterm under Openwindows (sparcstation elc; type 5
keyboard; openwindows 2; sunos 4.1.1) I find that the Caps Lock key is
interpreted as Shift Lock -- i.e. 123 comes out as !"# and so on. It looks
like a libXg bug to me...

As far as I'm concerned this is only a minor irritant -- Caps Lock is
pointless anyway in these days of OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT DON'T REQUIRE
YOU TO SHOUT -- but I wondered if anyone else had noticed this bug-ette
and/or had a fix for it?
