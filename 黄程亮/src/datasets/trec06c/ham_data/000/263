I had exactly the same problem, to the rescue came Dave Presotto
(Thanks again Dave). The terminal doesn't ever read the nvram, you have to
boot the cpu-server "/sparc/9sscpu" instead. This will give you some
error messages, but you can ignore them. Then proceed as per the
instructions.

I could mail you the rest of the help we got from Dave Presotto, if
you're interested. There were a few other problems as I remember it.
Mainly dealing with authentication.
