It's working here.  I have departed almost totally from the Bell Labs
recommended configuration.  I'm running a hacked version of the
terminal kernel on Sparcs, booting off local disc, using a remote Unix
machine running a hacked "u9fs" as the file server.  Lots of things
don't work yet.  I have a TODO list a light-year long.  I expect many
of my problems would go away if we had the resources to dedicate a CPU
server (to run daemons) and a file server.

I'm interested in hearing how others are doing...
