In the good old days, copyright notices meant something.
The latest instance of their devaluation is Matty's posting
in a public place of a number of copyrighted fonts from
the Plan 9 distribution (itself a violation of the copyright)
without reproducing the notice (which would be our
request to anyone who asked to copy them).

For those interested in maintaining the principle of
letting artists maintain ownership of their work, the
fonts Matty distributed should be stored with the
following notice:

The fonts in this directory are based on fonts
Copyright (c) 1985 Bigelow & Holmes Inc.

This text is (with a substitution for (c)) the contents of
/lib/font/bit/(pelm,lucm)/NOTICE
