Hi,
	This is in response to your request for sources on this debate. 
There is a good book written in favor of creation
TITLE: The mystery of life's origin : reassessing current theories
 Charles B. Thaxton, Walter L. Bradley, Roger L. Olsen.
PUBLISHER: New York : Philosophical Library, 1984.

The book mainly addresses the primary origin of life and is rather
technical, being written by chemists.  It also contains a large number of
references, but I would only recommend this book for someone with a good
background in chemistry i.e. at least one year of college chemistry,
though a layperson could read and understand the concepts if he or she
were willing to really work hard.

Hope this helps
Steve
