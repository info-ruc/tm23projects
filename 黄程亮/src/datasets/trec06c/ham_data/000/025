Subject: Plan 9 beginner's questions

I don't know how to shut down a file server or CPU
server, but to safely shut down a terminal, type "^T^Tr".
The connection to the file server is not cached, so
there is no need to sync.

The equivalent of ^C is delete.  (Long ago, Delete was
the standard interrupt character on Unix too, but
Berkeley, in their infinite wisdom, decided to switch
to ^C.)

The equivalent of ^S and ^Q is the scroll/noscroll
item on the middle mouse button menu, together with
the scrollbar.
