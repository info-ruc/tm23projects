For a good historical perspective of the modern creationist movement
I would recommend:  _The Creationists_
                    by Ronald L. Numbers
                    New York : A. A. Knopf, 1992.

This book skips the scientific debate of creation vs. evolution and
instead details the history of various Christian creationist movements
and creationist organizations starting from around 1900.  Very interesting
and, because it avoids the scientific debate, largely unbiased (read
Ronald Number's introduction for more details).  Most of the information
is based on first-hand accounts and interviews.
