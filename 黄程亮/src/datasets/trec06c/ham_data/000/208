| The example that the RFC cites is a special mailbox where errors are
| to be sent could be used as the envelope address (e.g. the mailing
| list administrator's address).

That's exactly what we do.

| I think that your sysadmins are right: the UA should reply to the From: 
| address stored within the message.  I think that RFC821 specifies other 
| headers that can be used, too, such as Reply-To:.

RFC 822 says that.  See sections 4.3.1 and 4.4.4.
