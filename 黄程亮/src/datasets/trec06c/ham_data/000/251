i know that rob et. al. were spotted at a recent usenix
conference sporting [34]86 laptops (or so i've heard).
so i'd like to know 
o is this included on the cd?
o is anybody using this
o this implies that the laptop is running the 
  fileserver, cpuserver and terminal software. is this
  possible to pull off on a sun or sgi?
