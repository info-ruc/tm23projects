How about "Reasons" by Josh McDowell and DonStewart, Living Books, (1981)
ISBM 0-8423-5287-2, most of which is devoted to that very topic.

Also helpful is a small section on "Don't Genesis 1 and 2 contain
2 contradictary accounts of creation?" in the book "Answers" by
Josh McDowell and Don Stewart, Here's Life Publishers, Campus Crusade
for Christ, ISBN 0-918956-65-X, published 1983.

Also contact:
Institute for Creation Research; P.O. Box 2667; El Cajon, CA 92021-0667
Ask them for materials on this subject.

Rex,

In soc.religion.christian you write:

>Tuesday, August 3, 1993 on the topic of Creation vs. Evolution.  

Would you like to try:

"Life - How Did It Get Here? By Evolution Or By Creation?" published by
the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, 1985

Yes, this was written by Jehovah's Witnesses.  I realize you may have many
differences with Jehovah's Witnesses, but on this subject you may find
agreement.  This book addresses many of the *theories* that evolutionist
have created, and counters them with Bibical as well as secular evidence
which exposes the evolutionary theory as being impossible.   This
book contains many illustrations and references.  It may be exactly what your 
looking for.
