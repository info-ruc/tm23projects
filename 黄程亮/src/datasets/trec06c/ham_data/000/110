I tried re-linking against MIT X11R4 libraries rather than the Openwindows
ones, with the same result. I guess it's an Openwindows 2 server
``feature''. Sigh.

Hmmm.... I think if I was using sam to edit a language which required upper
case I'd knock together some sort of filter to do the capitalisation and
pipe the file through it before a write... that's what the '|' command is 
there for! Couple of extra keystrokes perhaps (maybe only one if you're
using the keyboard extensions to sam) and it avoids the dreaded emacs...
