Subject: /dev/audio format?
Message-Id: <93Sep4.091950edt.292033@psuvax1.cse.psu.edu>

Should there be a standard format for files that
can be cat'ed to /dev/audio?

Pros:  it would seem nice to be able to simply
cat file >/dev/audio no matter what terminal I'm using.

Cons:  Picking some standard format locks us in
to either keeping redundant info, or throwing
potentially useful info away, as different machines
have different capabilities (8bit, 16bit, mono/stereo).

Any ideas?

The question is burning as I've got a SPARC and a 486
sitting here which have incompatible /dev/audios, and
that doesn't seem right for Plan 9.
