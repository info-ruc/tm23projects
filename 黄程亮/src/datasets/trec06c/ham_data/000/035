Your impression is the same as my impression.  It's a very usable system
by Bell Labs for Bell Labs to play on/create new stuff on.

Obviously the posters to c.o.r. will have opinions on what should
go into any OS (they made all sorts of suggestions for/criticisms of QNX too).

Probably few of them actually USE plan9.

You can see what strong forces there are for an OS to accrete "features".

Speaking of feeping creaturism, are there plans to add a "find" command?
