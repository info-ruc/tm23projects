CALL FOR PAPER:

		1st International Workshop on:
	Distributed and Speculative Constraint Processing
			---  DSCP'05 ---
    http://www.cs.utep.edu/mceberio/Research/Conferences/DSCP05/
		  held in conjunction with:
	    the 11th International Conference on
     Principles and Practice of Constraint Programming, CP'2005

			October 1 - 5, 2005
			Melia Sitges Hotel
		      Sitges (Barcelona) - Spain

		!!! EXTENDED DEADLINE: JUNE 29TH !!!

------------------------------------------------
Overview:

DSCP'05 addresses constraint processing techniques in distributed 
environments, with a special interest on speculative computations. 

A distributed constraint satisfaction problem (usually referred to 
as DisCSP) is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) in which multiple 
agents are involved. DisCSPs arise when pieces of the whole problem 
can be discharged / allocated to agents. These agents are generally 
independent (autonomous), but able to communicate, basically to let 
the others know (depending on the communication protocol) the result 
of their inner solving process. Pieces of the global problem may be, 
depending on the problem, variables, or constraints, or both.

Many problems in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can be formalized as 
DisCSPs. Therefore, we expect this workshop to impact a wide range 
of people, more specifically a lot of people involved in both CSP and 
MAS, or in either of these. Multi-agent systems are indeed very 
fashionable and convenient, for they make it possible, for instance, to 
take advantage of multi-processor machines, and for they also make it 
possible to design human-like efficient organizations of agents.

In addition to work on plain DisCSP, our workshop aims at emphasizing 
the process of speculative computations among agents. Indeed, even if 
multi-agent systems are very fashionable and convenient, their main 
limitation is that, as arises in human organizations, communication may 
be an issue: delayed or broken, it leads to incompleteness of the 
information in the reasoning structure. This is a concrete concern when 
we consider distributed systems such as the Internet, in which 
communication is indeed not guaranteed, and even if we could guarantee 
it, communication may either take time, or agents themselves may delay 
their sending information. In the case of such not ideal but practical 
situations, when problem-solving is at stake, frameworks for speculative
computations can constitute a solution. Some work was already carried out 
on speculative constraint processing, but only in master-slave systems.

-----------------------------------------------
Scope of DSCP:

In this workshop, we would be pleased to gather together researchers 
interested in all aspects of distributed and/or speculative constraint 
solving, such as:
* frameworks for DisCSPs
* algorithms
* communication protocols in DisCSPs
* theoretical issues, such as space complexity
* handling over-constrained DisCSPs, as well as performing optimization 
  using DisCSPs
* applications of DisCSPs
* frameworks for speculative computations in MAS
* theoretical work on communication protocols for speculative computation 
  in MAS
* algorithms for DisCSP solving with speculative computation
* applications
* ...
We encourage in particular the submission of work in progress, of work 
on very specialized aspects of distributed and/or speculative constraint 
processing, and of work emphasizing real applications of DSCP. 

------------------------------------------------
Submission:

Prospective attendees can submit a paper, which can be up to 15 pages 
in length. Authors will submit their papers electronically in postscript 
or pdf format. Papers should be formatted using the Lecture Notes in 
Computer Science (LNCS) style. 

Please send your submissions by email to mceberio@cs.utep.edu, with 
DSCP'05 Workshop Submission, as the subject of the email.

-------------------------------------------------
Important note: 

The workshop is open to the entire community. All participants will have 
to pay the registration fee that entitles them to participate in all CP/ICLP 
workshops, and at least one author of each accepted paper must attend 
the workshop.
