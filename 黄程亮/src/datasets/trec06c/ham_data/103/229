X-Spam-Not-Checked-rig: Message not rechecked



Dear TREC 2005 participants,

This is only the second message that I have sent to the
TREC 2005 mailing list (the other being the Welcome message).
The lack of additional messages is actually a positive
sign in that it means that TREC has been moving along
without serious issues.  The track mailing lists have been
busy finalizing task guidelines, and except for a
subtask in a few tracks, the guidelines are now complete.

Everything is also in place for you to be able to submit
TREC 2005 runs to NIST.  Before describing that process,
let me encourage you to take a look at the guidelines
for tracks you had not originally anticipated participating in
to check for new tasks of interest.  For example, there
is a text categorization task in the genomics track,
a document ranking task in the QA track, and the HARD and robust
tracks are sharing topics and documents that should support
interesting comparisons.  The tracks page in the active
participants' section of the TREC web site has a pointer
to the guidelines for each track (either directly, or
a link to the track website that has the guidelines).
For some tracks, the first deadline is next week (egad!)
so don't procrastinate in having a look.

The scripts that check TREC 2005 submissions for common errors
have been posted to the the "tools" page of the active participants'
section of the TREC web site.  The scripts are also linked
under the individual sections of the tracks page.  A README
file with complete details regarding the scripts is included
on the tools page.  The check script is not yet posted for
the tracks whose guidelines are not complete; those will
be posted once the task definition becomes firm.
There is a separate script for each track.

The scripts look for errors including such things as malformed
input, the same document being retrieved more than once for a topic,
documents that are not part of the official collection being
retrieved, etc.  The scripts also issues warnings of things
that aren't necessarily wrong, but often signify a problem,
such as fewer than the maximum number of documents retrieved.

You are *VERY STRONGLY ENCOURAGED* to use the scripts to
check your runs before submitting the runs to NIST.  The automatic
submission process will run the same checks on the files you submit,
and any runs that contain errors will be (automatically) rejected.
Any warning messages produced by a run submitted to NIST
will *not* be forwarded to the submitter.  Under no circumstances
will NIST accept a run by email because you couldn't get
it past the check process during submission.  It is your
responsibility to create a submission file that conforms to
the requirements specified in the guidelines and enforced by
the check script.

The README file gives lots of details about the scripts;
please read it before using them.   However, if you have
questions not covered by the README, or if you find a bug
in a script, please do let us know (trec@nist.gov).

To submit a run (or HARD track clarification form, or spam track
filter) to TREC 2005, you must fill out and
submit a web form.  There is a separate form for each track
that is tailored to the particular track's requirements.
Be sure to use the correct form for your run.
If you do not, you will get an error message saying that check_input
failed (because the document ids or topic numbers will be wrong).
The forms are located at
      http://trec.nist.gov/act_part/forms/results.forms.html
(which is linked to from the main page of the active participants'
part of the TREC web site as "Results Submissions Forms").

Enter the name of the submission file on the web form and the
form itself will upload the submission to the NIST machine.
Once you submit the form, a few data-validation checks are made
and the submission file is uploaded.  The appropriate check_input
script is run on the submission file.  If there are any errors,
they are reported back to the web browser and the run is rejected.
If the run checks out, it is entered into a table of runs and an
acknowledgment is mailed to the submitter of the run.  Please note:
your run has been successfully submitted ONLY if you receive an
acknowledgment from the submission procedure.  NIST does not save
runs that were attempted to be submitted but failed.
If we were to keep such runs around, you wouldn't be able to resubmit a
correct run using the same run-tag, we would waste a lot of disk space,
and we would get confused about what runs were what.

Last year, some groups had trouble submitting TREC runs because
their organization's firewall prevented files from being uploaded.
Sometimes, the firewall disallowed uploads but didn't actually
complain, just hung.  There isn't anything we can do on our end
to prevent this.  It may be worthwhile investigating earlier
(rather than the 10 minutes before the deadline) whether your system
can upload files.

Among the information asked for on a form are the run tag and
reply address.  This tag is used as a unique identifier for the
run at NIST.  Case is significant.  Tags may not contain a colon (":")
because a colon is a significant character in the format we use
to store run information.  The reply address is the email
address to which the acknowledgment will be sent.   Please make
sure the address supplied is valid and that mail sent to the address
will be read.  An emailed acknowledgment will not be received
instantaneously since there are likely to be many runs being
submitted simultaneously and allowance must be made for the vagaries
of mailers, but the acknowledgment should be received relatively quickly.
If there were no errors of any kind reported to the browser and you
do not receive an acknowledgment within several hours of the submission,
send mail to Ian Soboroff (ian.soboroff@nist.gov) to notify NIST
of the problem.  Please note that errors are only reported back
to the browser, and a run that has any errors reported has
NOT been submitted.


Happy TREC-ing,

Ellen
