Dear Romanian Club at Colombia,



             I am a Peace Corps volunteer in Romania.  I joined the Peace C=
orps in February 2004 and I will serve in Romania until April 2006.  I am a=
 volunteer for the institutional development of non-governmental organizati=
ons.  I am writing to request support from Romanian Students=92 Clubs in th=
e US for a project I am working on through my Peace Corps service.

Since joining the Peace Corps, I have become involved with the development =
of gender equality, combating domestic violence and helping to develop lead=
ership in young Romanian women.  Despite its efforts to move toward a more =
democratic and civil society, Romania continues to struggle with issues reg=
arding the role of women. There are some cultural beliefs and societal atti=
tudes that impede progress and the empowerment of Romanian women. Romania c=
ontinues to be a male-dominated society and many young women struggle to id=
entify female role models within their community.  There is also a general =
lack of support in public institutions for women=92s issues. Women=92s heal=
th and sex education remain widely neglected in the educational system. The=
 law continues to largely ignore problems such as domestic violence and sex=
ual harassment. All of these factors indicate a need to empower young women=
 so that they might contribute to society with positive new roles of leader=
ship and cooperation.

One way I work to advance the rights of women is through the Gender and Dev=
elopment Peace Corps committee (GAD), of which I am the President.  The GAD=
 committee is a group of 10 Peace Corps Volunteers and 10 Romanian counterp=
arts.  GAD develops projects to raise national awareness about gender issue=
s and creates a network of local women=92s organizations.  One GAD project =
is the Girls Leading Our World Camps (GLOW), conducted in Romania since 199=
6.

This August, 3 female Peace Corps Volunteers will lead a GLOW camp with 15 =
high school girls (15-17 years old) from 3 different communities in Romania=
=2E  We are also training a young Romanian woman to conduct future camps.  =
The camp offers a unique opportunity for the girls to learn about leadershi=
p, self-confidence and teamwork.  We will also discuss issues like body ima=
ge, healthy relationships, safe sex practices, domestic violence, and drugs=
/alcohol use.

We are seeking contributions through a Peace Corps Partnership Program in w=
hich donations from our home communities can be made to support our GLOW Ca=
mp.  We are attempting to raise an additional $1,300 (USD).  All donations =
are tax deductible.  I am requesting sponsorship from Romanian Students org=
anizations.  Any size of sponsorship or donation is welcome either from ind=
ividual students or from the Club/organization.  There are two ways you can=
 make a donation, online or via postal mail.



You can make a donation online through the Peace Corps website:
