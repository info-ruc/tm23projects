Person in charge of the Grenoble Summer Schools

Alina Voda Laboratoire d'Automatique de Grenoble, INPG, ENSIEG,
Grenoble

Audience

Firstly, those in control who want to learn and use set computation
and especially interval computation. Secondly, computer scientists and
interval analysis who are interested by control as an application
field for the techniques and solvers that they develop.

Prerequisite

Basic knowledge of control (transfer function, state space
representation, mathematics (set theory, matrix computation) and
scientific computing (MATLAB).

Organisation

The course will consist of a series of talks and opportunities to
practice on computers (mainly in MATLAB, but those interested may also
learn how to use a C++ library for interval computation).
Each participant will receive the book Applied Interval Analysis by
L. Jaulin, M . Kieffer, O. Didrit and E. Walter (Springer, London,
2001), copies of the talks and non commercial software will also be
provided.
