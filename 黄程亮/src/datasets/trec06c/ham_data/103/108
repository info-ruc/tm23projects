Ms. Mary Ann Riggs:

While we don't have the fiscal note from the Department of
Transportation at this time, we have been told that costs will be around
$27,600; therefore around 1,104 plates will need to be sold/registered
before the beneficiaries would see any income. =20

In addition, below please find a list of current fundraising plates and
how many plates were registered on 12/3/04.  For example, the lowest
selling plate had 1,552 registered plates -- if you multiply that by $25
(the annual fee associated with the Golf Wisconsin plate), it would have
brought in approx $38,800 in 2004. =20

I hope this information is useful to you.  Let me know if you need any
further information. =20

Thanks for your interest,

Luanne Kostelic  =20

Luanne, as you asked, the numbers of special plates.  Our records of
December 3, 2004 show the following numbers of plates registered in each
fund-raising special plate category:
=20
Endangered Resources  22,136 (first available January 1995)
Ducks Unlimited 1,552 (first available January 2001)
Celebrate Children 5,785 (first available January 1999)
Packers 16,515 (first available January 2001)
University plates (all campuses together) 7,181 (first available in the
late 1980's)

Rep. Ziegelbauer,

I recently read that you have introduced a golf license plate.  Your
website states "After the Wisconsin Department of Transportation
recovers the initial cost of creating the plate. . . ."

How much are those "initial costs?"  How many plates would have to be
purchased before the designated beneficiaries would see any income?

Thanks for your help.

MaryAnn Riggs
