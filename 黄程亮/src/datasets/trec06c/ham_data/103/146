   Decisions while gathering data just aren't in DMDX capabilities.

   It is.

   Only other thing to try is to use the <AbortItemKeyName>.  You'll only 
be able to have one response key and you'd have it set as both the positive 
response and the <aikn>.  Your item would have to play a wave file at it's 
commencement that has 500ms of silence followed by your tone.  If they 
respond then hopefully the response code will see the response and the 
abort item code will stop playing the wave file (hopefully because I've yet 
to test responses being abort keys as well).
