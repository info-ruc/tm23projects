Markus,

	I've always argued that there must be a way to meet any presentation
requirement with DMDX, but this one is certainly difficult.

	You might try something like the following.  Perhaps this is what
Jonathan had in mind.  The text displays are just to indicate what happened.
If you wanted feedback to item 2, you'd have to include your own branching
code.

<cr> <nfb>
+1 <t 500> * "target" <bic 100>;
+2 <t 3500> <wav> "skid"/ * "target";
0 <bu 200>;
100 "response received prior to 500 ms";
200  "End of item";

	Hope this helps,
	--Ken
