Subject: Conference in Heidelberg on Optimization Under Uncertainties

GAMM Activity Group on Applied Stochastic Analysis and Optimization
IGK 710 "Complex Processes: Modeling, Simulation and Optimization"

CONFERENCE ON OPTIMIZATION UNDER UNCERTAINTIES
Heidelberg (Germany),  September 28-30, 2005 (COUCH 2005)
University of Heidelberg

This conference will combine a wide range of topics important to
optimization problems where the models are subject to uncertainties.
The topics include, but not limited to robust optimization, theory and 
computational
methods for uncertain continuous mathematical programming problems and
optimal control problems, stochastic optimization, applications in 
finance, biology,
engineering design etc

Invited speakers:

Aharon Ben-Tal (Technion - Israel Institute of Technology, Haifa)
Christodoulos A. Floudas (Princeton University)
Kurt Marti (University of German Federal Armed Forces, Munich)
Ruediger Schultz (University of Duisburg-Essen)
Alexander Shapiro (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta)

A short course on stochastic programming will be offered on September 27,
a day before the workshop, by A. Shapiro (Georgia Institute of 
Technology, Atlanta).

Invited and contributed presentations will be scheduled during the
following three days. Participants who wish to present a talk are
invited to submit a title and an abstract to 
couch2005@iwr.uni-heidelberg.de
by June 30, 2005. Notification of acceptance will occur before July 20,
2005.

Additional information regarding registration, contributed talks,
deadlines, accommodation etc. is available from the workshop web site:
