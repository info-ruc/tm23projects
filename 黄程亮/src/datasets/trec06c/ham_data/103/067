   Mind you that value of 30 what chosen eons ago in the days before a high 
performance counter when we were lucky to know the retrace interval to 
within a tenth of a millisecond.  Given that every machine has one these 
days and we could assume that interval is known to within microseconds I 
could happily increase it's value to 300 and there'd be no loss of 
functionality.  It of course puts the onus on users to get the value of the 
retrace accurate which is why it's left at the value of 30.

   And yes, a machine with certain errors isn't good.  Once DMDX hits a 
certain error condition it just goes into a tight loop polling for the 
retrace indicator till it actually finds a retrace and then reschedules 
everything accordingly.  You can see it in the .AZK file as it will flag 
the error if it occurs during the presentation of a stimulus.  So you could 
build an item file and either run it yourself or make one that's amenable 
to Diagnostic mode and see just how often the errors occur in a 
tachistoscopic frame.  My guess is that it's rarely.  If it's actually a 
problem I can either make the number of timeouts till a certain error is 
thrown greater or make it under user control -- my guess is that I'd make a 
registry key with the value in it and let you use RegEdit to modify it 
because this is literally the first time it's been a concern.
