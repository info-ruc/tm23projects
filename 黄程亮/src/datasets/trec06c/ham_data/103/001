   Different for every keyboard, a lot of them were much worse than 5ms.

   USB devices I've tested had a 4ms SD.  The only way to test it is to 
build a test jig and use one of DMDX's test modes as is outlined in the 
DMDX Input help.  Or you can send one to me and I'll test it for you, if 
you want me to return it you'll have to include return shipping.

   Perhaps upping the XP USB polling rate like gamers do for their ultra 
high precision mice would affect the accuracy but I've yet to verify this.

USB Mouserate Switcher lets you enforce a mouse polling rate
of 250 Hz (4 ms), 500 Hz (2 ms) or 1000 Hz (1 ms)
and lets you restore Windows' original "usbport.sys" (8 ms)
if needed.
