The 2005 BISC International Special Event-FLINT05 " FORGING THE 
FRONTIERS" will be held in the University of California, Berkeley, from 
November 3 -6. UC Berkeley “WHERE FUZZY LOGIC BEGAN” is a preeminent 
research institution in the proximity of Silicon Valley. The successful 
applications of fuzzy logic and it’s rapid growth suggest that the 
impact of fuzzy logic will be felt increasingly in coming years. Fuzzy 
Logic is likely to play an especially important role in science and 
engineering, but eventually its influence may extend much farther. In 
many ways, fuzzy logic represents a significant paradigm shift in the 
aims of computing - a shift which reflects the fact that the human mind, 
unlike present day computers, possesses a remarkable ability to store 
and process information which is pervasively imprecise, uncertain and 
lacking in categoricity.

The BISC Program invites pioneer researchers from around the world who 
are interested in forging the frontiers by the use of fuzzy logic and 
soft computing methods. This special event will provide a unique 
opportunity for the academic and corporate communities to address new 
challenges, share solutions, and discuss research directions for the 
future.

Technical topics of interest include but are not limited to:
