   Can't happen.

   It wouldn't help you in any event as conditionals are all evaluated at 
item parse time, ie, before any display.  The best you can do is to have a 
really low Delay parameter and break your item into multiple items instead 
and live with a couple of ticks between items where if a response occurred 
it wouldn't register.  I've toyed with the idea of buffering input data 
across items for this sort of purpose but have yet to see a real need for 
it here (ie you're into sponsorship territory).
