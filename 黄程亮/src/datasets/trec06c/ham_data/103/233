Dear Friends,

The main organizers of this conference, Oscar Castillo and Patricia Melin, are 
major specialist in applications of interval-valued fuzzy techniques. They 
would welcome participation from our interval community.

*****************************************************************
International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, Neural Networks and Genetic
Algorithms (FNG 2005) 

Hispanic American Fuzzy Systems Association (HAFSA), Tijuana, Mexico,
October 13-14, 2005

Description

The International Conference will consist of papers describing
research work that deals with Computational Intelligence (CI)
methodologies for the development of hybrid intelligent systems. CI
methodologies at the moment include (at least) Fuzzy Logic, Neural
Networks, Genetic Algorithms, Intelligent Agents, and Chaos
Theory. The use of intelligent techniques, like neural networks, fuzzy
logic and genetic algorithms, for real-world problems is now widely
accepted. However, still the performance of any of these techniques
can be improved, in many situations, by using them in conjunction with
other techniques. For example, genetic algorithms can be used to
optimize the design of a neural network for time series prediction, or
fuzzy logic can be used to combine the information from expert neural
modules, just to mention two cases. Also, mathematical methods, like
the ones from Chaos and Fractal Theory, can be used in conjunction
with intelligent techniques to improve the performance of hybrid
systems for real-world applications. The international conference will
consist of papers addressing these hybrid approaches and similar ones,
either theoretically or for real-world applications. Also,
distinguished internationally recognized invited speakers will give
lectures on the main areas of CI. The conference is intended primarily
for researchers and graduate students working on these research areas.

Topics of interest (not limited to)

1. Successful new applications to real-world problems of CI techniques
that are found to achieve better results than conventional
techniques. In this case, special attention should be given to the
metrics used to compare CI techniques with conventional ones.

2. Developments of innovative hybrid methods combining CI techniques
and conventional techniques. In this case, the problems to be
considered in these papers may not be as complex as the ones in the
previous point, but the authors have to explain very carefully how
their proposed method could be used, in the future, to solve
real-world problems.

3. Papers considering original research on new CI architectures,
models or techniques are also welcome, but the authors would have to
make a detailed description of how their proposed approach is compared
with other related approaches.

Format and Submission Procedure

Papers must be send by email, by the prospective authors, to the
General Chair and the Program Chair. The paper must be send as a PDF
or word attachment with their email message. The papers will then be
distributed to the Reviewers for evaluation according to their
originality, technical soundness, writing, etc. Notifications of
acceptance will then be send to the authors by email. The authors of
accepted papers would then be asked to present it at the conference,
and send their registration form by the due date. The Proceedings (CD
form) will be prepared for distribution at the Conference. All papers
presented at the conference will be also published as an Edited Book
(Springer-Verlag), after the conference. Selected papers will be
considered, after improvements, for a Special Issue of the Fuzzy Sets
and Systems Journal of Elsevier (ISI Index).
