   Given that 16ms time I suspect what's happening is that the video 
drivers are having to wait till a retrace goes off before they are able to 
complete the requests they've told TimeDX are done already.  Probably got 
something to do with TimeDX polling the vertical retrace status constantly 
for several milliseconds per retrace and TimeDX wanting to blit a full 
screen of data every other retrace or so.  Basically circumstances that 
aren't likely to occur in DMDX, most people that do really demanding 
tachistoscopic displays aren't doing it to the whole display nor are they 
likely to be doing it when there's only one back buffer like TimeDX 
uses.  Full screen video is the only thing I can think of but all bets are 
off there anyway.
