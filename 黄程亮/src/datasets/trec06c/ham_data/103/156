Hi,

I have written an item file and now something happened that I don't
understand. In the result file the first few item still have a reaction
time after the item number, but than, surprise, in the file only 1.00 and
-1.00 are indicated.

here are some sample rtf file lines:
<snip>
+1 "" /<wav 2> "auf1_p" /  <ms% 750>  "*" / * <wav 2>  "auf1_t" c; +2 
<wav 2> "auf2_p" /  <ms% 750>  "*" / * <wav 2>  "auf2_t" c;
+3  <wav 2> "auf3_p" /  <ms% 750>  "*" / * <wav 2>  "auf3_t" c;
+4  <wav 2> "auf4_p" /  <ms% 750>  "*" / * <wav 2>  "auf4_t" c;
+5  <wav 2> "auf5_p" /  <ms% 750>  "*" / * <wav 2>  "auf5_t" c;
0 c;


0 <ln 0> "Jetzt geht es los!";

0 c;
$

0 c;

+3000    <wav 2> "brust_p1234c" / <ms% 750>  "*" /   * <wav 2>
"brust_t1234" c;

and here are some sample azk file lines:

<snip>
Subject 1, 06/22/2005 16:38:57 on HANUMAN, refresh 16.61ms
  Item       RT
     1   1015.22
     2    879.04
     3    849.56
     4    732.79
     5    552.47
  3005      1.00
  1208      1.00
  9908     -1.00
<\unsnip>

can anybody tell me what is going on, and what I can do to fix it?

best and thanks in advance,
