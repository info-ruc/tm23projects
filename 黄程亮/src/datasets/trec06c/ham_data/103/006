   I just had a play with this on my system and it reduced the SD on the 
system mouse from 6.40ms to 5.65ms so it's doing something but I suspect 
there's so much hanging off the mouse introducing latency that this is not 
a real indicator of the Mouserate Switcher's efficacy.  If I had a USB 
joystick or gamepad I'd test it but alas I don't.  Maybe tomorrow I'll have 
one.
