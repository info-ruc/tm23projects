"Mathematically meaningful" depends on your definition of a function.

(i)  If you consider arctan(y/x) as a single valued function (by taking
the principal value), then extending the range is wrong.

(ii) Continuing on the helix, you lose inclusion isotonicity. Consider

X1 = ([-2,-1],[-2,-1]), X2 =  ([1,2],[-2,-1]), and X3 = ([-2,2],[-2,-1]).

We have X1 \subset X3, X2 \subset X3. Extending the range on the helix
implies

either  arctan2(X1) \not\subset arctan2(X3)  or  arctan2(X2) \not\subset
arctan2(X3).

(iii) Continuing on the helix, you also lose analyticity of the
underlying complex function. See the discussion of the argument
functions in the CoStLy library
 (http://iamlasun8.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ae16/CoStLy.html). There
are applications, where analyticity is reqired and where the use of
non-analytic inclusion functions is prohibited.

Markus
