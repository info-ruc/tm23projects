>Please note the following fund opportunity:
>
>Program:          Research on Research Integrity (RFA-NR-06-001)
>Agency:            National Institutes of Health (NIH)
>Deadline:          August 16, 2005- Recommended Letters of Intent
>September 16, 2005 ­ Formal applications
>URL: http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-NR-06-001.html
>
>The purpose of the proposed grant program is to foster empirical research 
>on research integrity. The sponsoring programs are particularly interested 
>in research that will provide clear evidence (rates of occurrence and 
>impacts) of potential problems areas as well as societal, organizational, 
>group, and individual factors that affect, both positively and negatively, 
>integrity in research. Applications must have clear relevance to 
>biomedical, behavioral health sciences, and health services research. 
>Applicants are strongly encouraged to take into consideration problems or 
>issues that have relevance to specific missions of DHHS, NIH, AHRQ, or NIH 
>institutes and centers.
>
>While a great deal has been written about integrity in research and its 
>importance, empirical information is lacking in four crucial areas:
>
># the standards that guide responsible practice, how are they set, and the 
>extent to which researchers routinely adhere to these standards;
># the effectiveness of professional self-regulation in research; and
># the factors that influence students, researchers and research 
>institutions to adhere to or deviate from integrity in research and how 
>these factors can be reinforced or modified to promote responsible 
>practices; and
># the economic and intellectual impacts of behaviors that fail to adhere 
>to rules, regulations, guidelines, and commonly accepted professional 
>codes or norms.
>
>This RFA seeks applications for empirical research that will provide 
>information about these areas in ways that will aid policymaking and help 
>promote integrity in PHS funded research. The participating programs are 
>especially interested in quantifiable information that is relevant to 
>particular PHS research communities and/or research interests. Projects 
>that are relevant to the current NIH Roadmap Initiatives (New Pathways to 
>Discovery, Research Teams of the Future, and Re-engineering the Clinical 
>Research Enterprise) are also encouraged.
>
>Specific areas of interest include:
>1. Standards for responsible conduct (best practices;
>2. Self-regulation;
>3. Factors that enhance or undermine integrity; and
>4.  Economic, policy and scientific impacts.
>
>Letters of intend are recommended, but not required.
