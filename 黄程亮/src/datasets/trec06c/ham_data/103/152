Hi,

I was just wondering how exactly the <again when> keyword works if it 
is used with audio files. does it load the file into a more accessible 
place that allows it to repeatedly play it without closing and 
reopening it? 

This question is related to a previously posted question about 
presenting a wav file repeatedly without any noticeable gap between 
repetitions. The again when keyword achieves this but i also need it to 
stop when a response is input.

if i had an idea of how it worked, maybe i could find a different 
program out there that would be able to have a wav file repeat 
continuously but also stop when required.

Thanks!
Ranmalee
