  abstract =     "A hybrid method for plotting 2-dimensional curves,
                 defined implicitly by equations of the form f(x,y) = 0
                 is presented. The method is extremely robust and
                 reliable and consists of Space Covering techniques,
                 Continuation principles and Interval analysis (i.e.
                 SCCI). The space covering, based on iterated
                 subdivision, guarantees that no curve branches or
                 isolated curve parts or even points are lost (which can
                 happen if grid methods are used). The continuation
                 method is initiated in a subarea as soon as it is
                 proven that the subarea contains only one smooth curve.
                 Such a subarea does not need to be subdivided further
                 so that the computation is accelerated as far as
                 possible with respect to the subdivision process. The
                 novelty of the SCCI-hybrid method is the intense use of
                 the implicit function theorem for controlling the steps
                 of the method. Although the implicit function theorem
                 has a rather local nature, it is empowered with global
                 properties by evaluating it in an interval environment.
                 This means that the theorem can provide global
                 information about the curve in a subarea such as
                 existence, non-existence, uniqueness of the curve or
                 even the presence of singular points. The information
                 gained allows the above-mentioned control of the
                 subarea and the decision of its further processing,
                 i.e. deleting it, subdividing it, switching to the
                 continuation method or preparing the plotting of the
                 curve in this subarea. The curves can be processed
                 mathematically in such a manner, that the derivation of
                 the plotted curve from the exact curve is as small as
                 desired (modulo the screen resolution).",
