  abstract =     "In both [3] and [8], the authors review the
                 implementation of the basic operations in interval
                 arithmetic, and in particular discuss the different
                 approaches given in the literature for interval
                 division when the divisor interval contains zero. In
                 these papers, and in the references therein, the basic
                 operations are defined for real or extended real
                 interval operands.\par

                 Division by an interval containing zero is a special
                 case of an interval function for which the input
                 arguments contain points outside the domain of the
                 underlying point function. A number of approaches exist
                 in the literature, [7], [12], to remove restrictions on
                 the domain of interval functions and hence obtain a
                 closed, exception-free interval system.\par

                 In this paper, we present an alternative approach to
                 remove restrictions on the domain of interval functions
                 and to guarantee the inclusion property in all
                 situations, even when some input intervals contain
                 points that lie outside the domain of the underlying
                 point function. To achieve this, we allow for the
                 (efficient) set-based representation of non-real
                 results. The computed intervals are sharp, yet contain
                 more information and the resulting interval system is
                 closed and exception-free. We also show how the
                 presented ideas can be implemented in an interval
                 arithmetic library. The performance overhead is
                 negligible compared to the fact that the implementation
                 using the new approach offers 100\% reliability in
                 return.\par

                 The structure of the paper is as follows. We set off
                 with a motivating example in Sect. 1. In Sect. 2, we
                 review various approaches to interval division and then
                 introduce vset-division of real intervals, based on the
                 newly introduced concept of value set or vset. In Sect.
                 3, we give a formal definition of real vset-intervals
                 and arithmetic on these intervals. We prove a number of
                 essential properties and point out the likenesses and
                 differences with other approaches. Finally, in Sect. 4,
                 we discuss the implementation of vset-interval
                 arithmetic in a floating-point context.",
