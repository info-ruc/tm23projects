Hi Jonathan,

mention.

That is good to know, although on one machine I am still getting 'certain 
errors'
whatever settings I use, and that worries me.

The same hardware (really exactly the same) performs very well under Win98.

I did reduce the number of line to blit to less than a quarter of the automatic
values, without too much difference: still more than 40% time-outs.

Would it not be possible to use the multi media timer to unlock the vertical
retrace thread, instead of relying on sleep times? You're using the MM timer
anyway. In my experience Window's sleep times can be very unreliable, but
the MM timer is rock solid. This could also cut down on polling times, as
less safety margin is needed.
