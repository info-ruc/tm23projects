>Grants.gov was developed as part of the President’s Management Agenda 
>(PMA) and related E-Government Strategy (P.L. 106-107). It is one of 24 
>PMA initiatives dedicated to improving government services via the 
>Internet. Grants.gov is a collaborative initiative, developed in 
>partnership by 11 Federal agencies. The Program is led the U.S. Department 
>of Health and Human Services. Partner agencies include the U.S. 
>Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Homeland 
>Security, Housing and Urban Development, Justice, Labor, Transportation 
>and the National Science Foundation.
>
>Grants.gov allows organizations to electronically find and apply for 
>competitive grant opportunities from all Federal grant-making agencies. It 
>is, currently, the single access point for over 900 grant programs offered 
>by the 26 Federal grant-making agencies.
>
>Grants.gov has two main features:  Find and Apply.  We encourage 
>investigators to log onto <www.grants.gov>, click on the “Find” tab, and 
>enter their Fund Profile to begin receiving announcements (click on 
>“Receive Grant Opportunity Emails”) of opportunities that match your 
>research interests.  You can also use grants.gov to perform basic searches 
>for fund opportunities, or you can browse by category (science, 
>technology, energy, humanities, etc.) or by agency.  You do not need a 
>password to find opportunities.
>
>More and more agencies are requiring that proposals be submitted through 
>grants.gov.  The National Science Foundation (NSF), for example, has just 
>identified 23 programs that “offer proposers the option to utilize 
>Grants.gov to prepare and submit proposals.”  Ultimately submission of 
>proposals to NSF via grants.gov will be required.
>
>According to the website <www.grants.gov>, “Grants.gov is designed to be 
>user friendly and offers a range of online user support tools, including:
>
>#       Tutorial: A computer-based training tool
>#        Context-Sensitive Help: Information specific to the web page 
>being viewed
>#       User Guide: An indexed comprehensive guide to reference 
>information on Grants.gov: Viewable online and downloadable in PDF and 
>Word formats
>#       Quick Reference: Reference support likely to be used most often
>#        Frequent Questions and Answers

>“These tools should provide grantors and the grant community with 
>everything needed to know to use the site. These links can be found by 
>clicking on the Customer Support tab on the site.
>
>“Personalized support is also available through the Grants.gov Contact 
>Center (support@grants.gov)."
>
>Once you find the relevant Funding Opportunity and/or CFDA number of a 
>program that matches your research interest you are ready to apply for 
>support via Grants.gov.
>
>1.  The first step in the process to download the particular grant 
>application package for your proposal.    However before you can download 
>the application package you must download and install PureEdge Viewer at 
><http://www.grants.gov/DownloadViewer>. This program will allow you to 
>access, complete, and submit applications electronically.  Note that 
>Grants.gov strongly recommends the use of Internet Explorer and not other 
>browsers.  The application package you download will contain not only 
>forms that are required for the solicitation, but also application 
>instructions specific to the solicitation.
>
>2.  Complete the application package off-line.  Much of the application 
>face-page (SF424) is pre-filled as a result of your download.  Areas that 
>need to be completed on the face-page will be highlighted in 
>yellow.  Morningside investigators, when prompted, should enter 049179401 
>as our DUNS number. We are, additionally, already registered with the 
>Contractor Clearinghouse Registry (CCR).
>
>3.  Notify your OPG Projects Officer that you are preparing an application 
>that must be submitted via email;  send him/her an advance copy of your 
>proposal for review and comment.
>
>4.  Once your Projects Officer approves the submission send them all parts 
>of your proposal via email or, if very large, via a CD.  Please remember 
>that we require 2 hard-copies of your proposal prior to its submission.
>
>5.  Ensure you have prepared, and all approvers have signed off on your 
>RASCAL PropTrak form.
>
>6.  OPG will upload and submit your proposal via grants.gov.
>
>Please note that proposal submission via grants.gov, although required by 
>many programs is not the most user-friendly system OPG has 
>encountered.  It especially gets very slow after 3 PM in the afternoon ­ 
>it is often so slow that it takes ½ hour or more for us to submit one 
>proposal.  As the system does not allow multiple logins under the same ID 
>at the same time Projects Officers can only work to submit one proposal at 
>a time.  We urge you to get us your proposal as early before the deadline 
>as is possible.  Please remember that we generally process proposals on a 
>first-come, first-serve basis.  Additionally, OPG guarantees on-time 
>submission if we receive proposals at least 2 business-days prior to the 
>deadline.
>
>Please contact your OPG Projects Officer for additional information about 
>grants.gov.
