Hello, i'm writing you because we are organizing an art show at our
gallery in new york,Our art space is not a commercial one, but still i
wanted to invite you to participate.
here  i'm sending you here a brief description of the art space as
well of the basic (and i mean really basic) concept of the show. the
suggested name until now is "and then it was us" but it most surely
will change, still i just wanted to email you the info so if you get
interested, we can start working out an idea for collaboration from
you. in case you are not interested, but know someone who might fit
and might be interested, please let me know.


here is the text:

Local Project is a non-profit organization committed to building a
forum for artists, creating synergy between their art work and the
public.  LP supports all forms of self-expression by providing an open
space for artists without concern to their genre, medium, or
provenance. In using diversity as the key to growth, both the artist
and the community collaborate toward a richer and fuller development
of both.

As part of this year's calendar Local Project is organizing and
inviting artists to become part of "And then it was us", a collective
and multidisciplinary art show opening for one week on November 2005.
"And then it was us" will show the art work of artists coming from
Europe, or with an European background, whose work represents the
other side of the Europe that mainstream media shows. People and
communities reconstructing an identity after years living on war,
after the transition from communism, with a constant migration and
facing economic, political and social crisis.
The exhibition will show artists living in Europe as well as work from
immigrant artists living in the US, creating a dialogue between the
differences of their artistic representations.

For any concerns, questions or suggestions, please feel free to contact me,
