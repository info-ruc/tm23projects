GREETING!!!
 
Dearest One,
 
Good a thing to write you. I have a proposal for you,this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to honour against your will.  Your profile pushed me to send you this mail.
 
I am mohammed malik,21years old  My late parents  Mr & Mrs Tureh Malik.My  late father was a highly reputable busnness magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the capital of Ivory coast during his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France during one of his business trips abroad year 12th.Febuary 2003.
 
Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncle of his who travelled with him at that time.But God knows the truth! My mother died when I was just 10years old,and since then my father took me so special.
 
 Before his death on Febuary 12 2003 he called me who accompanied him to the hospital and told me that he has the sum of Twenty two million,seven hundred thousand United State Dollars.(USD$22.700,000) compile in two metallic boxes and deposited with one of the leading security company here in Abidjan-Cote D'ivoire.
 
 
He further told me that he deposited the consignment  in my name,and finally issued a written instruction to his the security company  whom he said is in possession of all the necessary but legal documents to this fund and the security company .
 
I am just 21 years old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do,this is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of incessant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life.I am in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards.Your suggestions and ideas will be highly regarded.
 
 
Now permit me to ask these few questions:- 

1. Can you honestly help me as your child? 
2. Can i completely trust you? 
3. What percentage of the total amount in question will be good for you?  
 
Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.
 
Thank you so much as you read this mail comprehensively.
 
My sincere regards,
mohammed  malik
