   A certain error is thrown after 30 sequential timeouts.  You could try 
increasing the sleep time to within a millisecond or two of the retrace 
interval.  If the machine is allergic to DMDX trying to determine the state 
of the raster it's conceivable that trying to do less of it might help things.

   The thread has to go to sleep, if it doesn't nothing else executes, the 
machine freezes.  When it goes to sleep it tells the OS I'd like to wake up 
in N milliseconds.  On your machines it gets to wake up much later than it 
asked for.  It's not in DMDX's control.  You happen to have some crappy 
combination of components that's less than excellent for DMDX's 
purposes.  Could be your chipset, your video card, who knows.
