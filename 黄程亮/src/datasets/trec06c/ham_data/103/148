  path and other minor problems with Enhanced Carbon Emacs (Mac OS X.3)

Hi,

as a new subscriber to this list, I first feel obliged to thank all the 
people who work at making emacs availalble on the mac.

1-In order to make Enhanced Carbon Emacs work as the emacs command in a 
shell, I had to replace, in
Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/environment.plist,
/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin
by
/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp
(before running set-environment).

Has anybody noticed this before? Or did I miss something?

2-From Franconi's readme.txt :

> - If the provided dot-emacs.el is copied in your personal ~/.emacs
>   file, auto-magically the emacs bundled with MacOS X (in /usr/bin)
>   and the fink installed emacs (in /sw/bin) will become enhanced as
>   well.

Running /usr/bin/emacs in a shell, with Franconi's dot-emacs.el as 
.emacs, yields
Error in init file: File error: "Cannot open load file", 
"/Applications/Emacs.app/Content\
s/Resources/share/emacs/site-lisp/site-start.el

Again, this is a path problem. I tried replacing, in .emacs,
(load-local-site-start 
"/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/share/emacs/site-lisp"))
by
(load-local-site-start 
"/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp").

Something gets loaded, yet /usr/bin/emacs is not enhanced. Why?

These are not serious bugs, but I would really like to understand what 
is going on. Thanks.

Yes, that's true. The shell script /Applications/Enhanced Carbon =20
Emacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp/emacs had to be put into into =20
another directory than /Applications/Enhanced Carbon =20
Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin because this one already has the emacs =20
application programme, that's not 'relocated' correctly and hardly ever =20=

works. I chose to use the script directly when I needed to install =20
AUCTeX or preview-latex etc.

When did you find you had to invent this clever idea?

And yes: you did miss something! Recently there are better Carbon =20
Emacsen around, from 2005, that might provide better results. Aquamacs =20=

(http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/aquamacs/Aquamacs-Emacs=20
-0.9.2b8.dmg?download, http://aquamacs.org/) gets enhanced into another =20=

direction: being better integrated into the Aqua look&feel. And it's =20
supported by its developers here in this list. You still have to use =20
the work of others to have AUCTeX and friends installed: =20
http://yaced.sourceforge.net/. Norm Gall has Yet Another Carbon Emacs =20=

/usr/bin/emacs is a very old programme that Apple included into Mac OS =20=

X. Check its version! It's 21.2! I support with my .emacs file =20
different Emacsen in different environments. So I added

	(defconst mWS (symbol-value 'window-system)
	  "Running as some windowing system's client,
	   or as slave of a terminal emulator?")

and use this variable later:

     (cond ((string=3D "nil" mWS)
         (message "Sind im Terminal")
         (load "~/.emacs_nil")
     ))  ; Ende Terminal

So I have (external) sections to setup Emacs. You could put Enrico =20
Franconi's .emacs code, at least some parts, into such a clause, =20
comparing mWS with "mac", the window-system in which Carbon Emacs runs. =20=

(Others are x11 or windows.)

Thanks.

It looks good indeed. However, the meta key is not bound to command,  
and I cannot type ~ (tilda) (I get empty set instead). For the moment,  
Enhanced Carbon Emacs is OK for me.

You can bind meta to the option key (see item in Options menu), or  
set Command to meta in .emacs (see the Aquamacs wiki -- from Help menu).
For ~: what keys do you need to press for this? What kind of keyboard?

I usually press alt (aka option) n space.
This is a French keyboard.

That's as in German. I have this "customization" active for Aquamacs:

         (setq mac-pass-option-to-system t)
         (setq mac-command-key-is-meta t)
         (setq mac-option-modifier nil)
         (setq mac-command-modifier nil)
         (setq mac-control-modifier nil)
         (setq one-buffer-one-frame nil)
         (setq mac-allow-anti-aliasing nil)
         (setq mac-transparency-alpha 80)

With this the Alt key just alternates the keyboard layout, i.e. you get=20=

~, =80, @ ... It makes Aquamacs not to communicate with Aqua, i.e. there=20=

is no way to exchange selections with other tools and applications.

Ok, I can confirm there's still (or again) a bug regarding composed =20
characters (deadkeys). It'll be fixed - thanks Pierre for reporting.

Well, Command-C/X/V don't work any more of course because you've =20
bound Meta to Command. You can still use Copy/Cut/Paste in the Edit =20
menu to exchange data.
