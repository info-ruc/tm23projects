Dear Colleague,

Prof. Zissimos Mourelatos from Oakland University and I are planning 
to edit a Special Issue of the ASME Transactions, Journal of Mechanical 
Design (JMD) on "Risk-Based and Robust Design." For your information, 
I have enclosed the Call for Papers (CFP).

Could you please disseminate the enclosed CFP to your colleagues, 
in particular those who might be interested to submit a paper to the special

issue?

As detailed in the attachment, the deadline for submission is 
September 16, with accepted papers to appear in the July 2006 issue 
of JMD.

We believe that this will be a good forum to present the latest
advances in the area of risk based and robust design. We look 
forward to receiving your very best paper in the area.

Thank you.

Best Regards,

-Shapour
