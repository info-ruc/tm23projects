I've tried s=76 and n=17, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work. 
After the practice, the stimulus still starts in the middle of a 
sentence. If possible, I'd like to keep the block as a whole, so that 
the 1292 lines in a block remain as one unit (so g=1292). Any 
suggestions?  

Thanks again!
Jesse
