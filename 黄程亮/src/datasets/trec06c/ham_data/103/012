Hi,

I am part of a research group that is investigating whether DMDX could
be a valid alternative to Eprime (for us, obviously it is a very nice
program!).

We need now to use a microphone as input device, which with Eprime
requires a 450$ additional device. We were very happy that a colleague
pointed us to DMDX. However, the software requirement page mentions
that not everything is working perfectly with DMDX under windows XP,
and we were wondering whether this touches the microphone input.

Thanks for your time,
Stefano
