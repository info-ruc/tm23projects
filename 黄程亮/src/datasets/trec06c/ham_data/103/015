Call for Participation: ISIPTA '05
4th Int. Symposium on Imprecise Probabilities and Their Applications
July 20-23, 2005 - Carnegie Mellon University
http://www.sipta.org/isipta05


Highlights:
- Invited talks by Arthur Dempster and Isaac Levi
- Tutorials by Gert de Cooman, Paolo Vicig and Kurt Weichselberger
- Workshop on Financial Risk Assessment, on the morning of July 24
- 46 technical papers will be presented (oral and poster) on July 21-23

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ISIPTA meetings are one of the primary international forums to
present and discuss new results on the theory and applications of
imprecise probabilities. Imprecise probability has a wide scope, being
a generic term for the many mathematical or statistical models which
measure chance or uncertainty without sharp numerical
probabilities. These models include belief functions, Choquet
capacities, comparative probability orderings, convex sets of
probability measures, fuzzy measures, interval-valued probabilities,
possibility measures, plausibility measures, and upper and lower
expectations or previsions. Imprecise probability models are needed in
inference problems where the relevant information is scarce, vague or
conflicting, and in decision problems where preferences may also be
incomplete.

The program with all tutorials, sessions and invited talks can
be found at the site of the symposium (http://www.sipta.org/isipta05).
The site also contains information about location and registration.

Workshop on Financial Risk Assessment
-------------------------------------
There will be a workshop addendum to the conference, to be held on the morning 
of July 24, with invited speakers
on the topic of financial risk assessment, to which all
of the ISIPTA'05 participants are welcome, at no additional
registration cost. The list of invited talks to be presented
at the workshop can be found at the symposium site.
