   All audio is loaded into memory (a buffer) before an item plays it.  If 
<aw> works with audio (and it wouldn't surprise me in the least if it 
didn't) then it will play the same buffer again if it's finished playing 
from the first command to play it.

   Yeah, <aw> won't be stopping.

   The <BackgroundSound> keyword doesn't do it?
