   None of which will particularly affect DMDX's ability to run I might 
mention.  TimeDX poses a particularly intensive test of the hardware as not 
only is it tracking the retrace but it's also almost constantly updating 
the screen.  You might see some reduction in the long sleeps if you reduce 
the number of lines to blit but unless you plan on displaying extremely 
intensive tachistoscopic sequences I find that machines that have less than 
stellar TimeDX performance as you are finding have no trouble with actual 
DMDX work.

   I suspect the large sleep times are caused by the video driver batching 
up display commands and once TimeDX goes to sleep the video driver goes 
into overdrive doing all the stuff it told TimeDX it had already done.  I 
tend to have a whole range of video driver versions as sometimes the latest 
drivers are the worst performers -- but that's still just TimeDX 
performance.  DMDX tends to be fine.

   Another thing to bear in mind is that the default 8 bit video modes are 
almost useless with modern video cards so tests in TimeDX using them are 
likely to be more crippled than the 16 and 32 bit video modes.

   I would point out that Windows 98 is still 32 bit windows, it's just not 
NT based and requires WDM drivers.

   It almost has to be, I just checked this machine and it's fine.  I see 
the odd machine around the department (one in recent memory that I can 
think of but that was a year ago) that has similar sorts of TimeDX 
performance but when it's running experiments you never see display 
presentation errors.  My guess is that there's some feature of less than 
the most recent video cards causing the problem as I used to swear by TNT2 
video cards but in the machine I see the problem with the TNT2 didn't solve 
the problem.
