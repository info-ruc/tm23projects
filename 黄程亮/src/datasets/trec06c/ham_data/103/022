Jonathan,

I've investigated this problem further by checking another machine.

This is a 3.2 mHz 64 bit hyper threading machine with 2 gb of memory
and yet another video card. It run WinXP and has the latest version
of everything. This machine is serious overkill for running DMDX, but still
I get the same results: over 50% of timeouts and actual sleep times of
up to 16 ms, while 6 ms sleep is requested. I tried all different settings,
but nothing seems to make a difference.

(Next to it is an old 1 gHz Win98 machine, and it manages 0% timeouts
with hardly any tweaking at all)

So, this is the third 32 bit machine that I've tested that has the same 
problem.
All machines have different video cards, and two run Win XP while the
third one runs Win2000.

We have even disabled the Keithley card on the last machine: it doesn't
make a difference.

I really don't know what is happening here, but it looks like 32 bit Windows
and DMDX don't like each other very much.

I haven't been able to have a look at your other driver suggestions yet, as the
technical guy knowing about this wasn't available. But it seems very unlikely
that it is a specific driver problem when we have  three machines, with almost
nothing in common, all showing the same problem.

Maarten
