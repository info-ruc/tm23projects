Hi,

I'm trying to construct an experiment in which two audio signals are mixed 
together and start simultaneously. One steam is made of a single long wav 
file, whereas the other one is made of 4 small wav files.

For simplicity, one can imagine that one signal comes in the right ear and 
one comes in the left ear, similarly to dichotic listening experiments:



R channel: RIGHT_WORD

L channel: left_word1 --> left_word2 --> left_word3 --> left_word4



I've followed the suggestion made on Mike Ford's page to use the "svp" keyword.

While I've been able to have two files presented simultaneously (one on the 
right, one on the left), I've been unable to have the remaining files 
played SEQUENTIALY on the left channel.

Here is a sample of the script:



=1 <ms% 1000> / <svp start> %0 * <wav 1> "RIGHT_WORD" / <wav 0> 
"left_word1" /

<wav 0> "left_word2" /  <wav 0> "left_word3" /  <wav 0> "left_word4";



Any help or advice would be appreciated.

Thanks,

-Sid
