   I'm implementing interval arithmetic in my programming language "Frink":

   http://futureboy.us/frinkdocs/

   and I'm attempting to implement the two-argument version of
arctan[x,y], but I'm encountering a few difficulties in dealing with
discontinuities and would like some suggestions.

   If we define arctan[x,y] to return arctan[x/y], but corrected for
quadrant, we get a discontinuity when going from quadrant III to
quadrant IV where the value jumps from -pi to +pi along the line at x=0
where y goes from 0 to -infinity.

   Does anyone have an elegant method or redefinition to overcome this
discontinuity?
