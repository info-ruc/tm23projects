Dear Colleagues,

There is a push-and-pull between the concepts and practices of =
"intellectual property" and "free-exchange of ideas". Personally, I have =
never had any interest in owning "intellectual property", but a strong =
interest in free exchange of ideas.
=20
I did not like the idea of allowing my name on a patent application, but =
reluctantly agreed to it, thinking then and still that it is of no =
importance. And yet, I have been made aware that it has caused some =
concern among some of you, my colleagues. For that I am surprised and =
very sorry. I would like to have your thoughts on how to rectify the =
situation.

I do not understand the practice of patents on software, even though it =
is evidently important in commercial enterprises, e.g. Microsoft, etc. =
What bothers me a lot about patents on interval software is that the =
algorithms concerned seem to me to be but variations and combinations of =
themes and techniques that have been in circulation for decades. =
Hundreds of authors around the world have been publishing such =
techniques for many decades.=20

And yet it could be argued, I suppose,  that if a new variation is =
worthy of being published in a journal or book, it might be regarded as =
containing "intellectual property" that could be "protected by a =
patent". I do not understand what that means either. I have even heard =
one of you express concern that you "would be descended upon by an army =
of Sun Microsystems lawyers".=20
Good grief I hope not !=20

I do not understand the intricacies of patent or copyright law, and have =
absolutely no interest in the subject, except I don't like it when =
something impedes free exchange of ideas. So how can we fix the =
situation, or is there anything to be fixed?
Perhaps it is a non-problem? If it is a problem, then is there a =
solution? If so, what is it ?

best wishes to all,

Ray (Ramon Moore)
