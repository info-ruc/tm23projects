 This is always the case when considering what essentially are
multivalued functions.  You have to implicitly or explicitly chose a
branch and evaluate the function on this branch instead of its Riemann
hypersurface.  (What you are considering can be viewed as a
fundamental function of one complex variable, namely arg.)  (Note that
you should declare explicitly which "side" the branch cut itself
belongs to.  Standard notation in the CAS community is "counter
clockwise continuous", i.e., to have arg, ln, etc. be continuous when
approaching the negative real axis from above.)  Also note that the
Riemann surface and its image may be much more complicated than for a
simple arg.  Have a look at the graph of the complex arcsine function
at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/InverseSine.html and think about
continuing the graph -- especially for the real part.

 You could, but that would violate inclusion monotonicity, which would
for many applications be a really bad thing.  And what would you do
with ([-1,1], [-1,1])?  Your argument above would suggest to return
the real axis.

 There is another possibility of handling the admittedly arbitrary
branch cut, namely to return the union of two intervals.  The
advantage of this approach is to significantly reduce overestimation;
the disadvantage is that further up in the algorithms you may need to
limit the number of intervals by explicitly enlarging selected ones to
avoid an exponential explosion.  Then again, often, you do not need
to.

 As I said above: Inclusion monotonicity is something you should
strongly consider supporting.  It would be potentially disastrous to
have a bisectioning algorithm and then not have 
arg(-1+[-1,-1,3]*I) subset arg(-1+[-1,1/2]*I).
