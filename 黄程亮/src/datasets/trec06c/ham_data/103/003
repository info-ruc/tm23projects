Subject: Conference in Baikal, Russia on Optimisation Methods

This is the Thirteenth Triennial Baikal International Conference on
Optimisation Methods & their Applications, which traditionally (since 1969)
brings together the engineers and the scientists working in the general
area of optimisation. 

Themes
The conference will cover all topics related to optimisation and 
include the following sessions:
Mathematical programming 
Interval analysis 
Optimal control 
Inverse and ill-posed problems in applied mathematics 
Modelling of technical and nature systems 

The special attention will be paid to the following topics:
