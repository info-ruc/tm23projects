Hi everyone, 

I am putting together a large self-paced moving time window study in 
DMDX, but am having some trouble with the block randomization. I’m 
worried that the items in the practice run are affecting the scrambling 
because after the practice, the experiment sometimes starts in the 
middle of a block in the middle of a sentence. 

Do I have the n, s, and g parameters correct? There are 5 blocks with 
76 experiment items. Each item takes 17 DMDX item lines (including the 
0 and 800 items) and each block is followed by a rest. I have 10 
practice items that all have the same item number (7). I’ve set n=6460 
(17*76*5) and g=1296 (17*76). 

Oddly, it seems to work with a smaller file, but with the same basic 
set up. Script is included below, much shortened. 

Thanks in advance for your help, 
Jesse
