Jonathan,

> How does it not work?  It looks good to me.

I've just tried the script on a different computer and found exactly the
same problem.
I used DMDX 3.1.2.6 on WIN XP and 98.
I've also recorded the output signal to see what happens.

The two first files on each channel (RIGHT_WORD and left_word1) strart ok
and are perferctly synchronized.
However, the 3 remaing files (left_word2...4) do not appear untill 400 ms
after the offset of left_word1 (!) and are strangly srambled altogether
(!!!).

Something that might help. I seems to have to do with adding %0 to "svp
start".
If I delete the %0, I found that the files are showing a convenient and
expected behavior. However, when doing that I loose synchrony of the first
files, given that %0 avoid the concurent file from starting 1 tick later, as
described in the audio input help.

Hi,
I'm trying to construct an experiment in which two audio signals are mixed
together and start simultaneously. One steam is made of a single long wav
file, whereas the other one is made of 4 small wav files.
For simplicity, one can imagine that one signal comes in the right ear and
one comes in the left ear, similarly to dichotic listening experiments:

R channel: RIGHT_WORD
L channel: left_word1 --> left_word2 --> left_word3 --> left_word4

I've followed the suggestion made on Mike Ford's page to use the "svp"
keyword.
While I've been able to have two files presented simultaneously (one on the
right, one on the left), I've been unable to have the remaining files played
SEQUENTIALY on the left channel.

Here is a sample of the script:
=1 <ms% 1000> / <svp start> %0 * <wav 1> "RIGHT_WORD" / <wav 0> "left_word1"
/
<wav 0> "left_word2" /  <wav 0> "left_word3" /  <wav 0> "left_word4";

Any help or advice would be appreciated.
Thanks,

-Sid
