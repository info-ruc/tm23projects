I have been using a joystick in the gameport of a windows 98 machine,
which works fine. However I want to run some RT studies on my laptop
which is an XP machine without many ports - I only have a choice
between the keyboard or a USB device (gamepad/joystick or mouse).

I have read that the keyboard timing is something like 5ms error rate,
though maybe it might be different with a laptop?

I want to use a gamepad and would like to know how I would be able to
determine what timing accuracy I can get with a USB gamepad (which
Timedx recognises in the input test) - or do you have any best
guesses? And what do you think is the best option with this setup for
getting the the most accurate timing?

Thanks,
