Subject: serial board
Priority: normal

I'm having trouble assembling the serial board. When I do the 
test(see snip below) I only get about 5 volts.  When I try and run 
the downloader, I don't see the green light come on.  (tried two 
different computers....)

any suggestions? thanks in advance,
						Owen

Now temporarily jumper the -12 volt supply (pin 6 of the MAX232)
to pin 10 of the MAX232, which is the input side of this output stage. Again measure the voltage at
pin 3 of J9---it should now read +10 to +12 volts.
