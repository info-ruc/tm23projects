Hi all,

I just finished searching the FAQ for stepper motor driving tips and found
none. :(

Anyone know what the most efficient way to connect a stepper motor to the HB?

I know that they have these $8ish driver chips...but I've never used one.  If
anyone has any experience with connecting stepper motors to the HB I'd
appreciate some tips or links...

Thanks!!!
Gerald.
