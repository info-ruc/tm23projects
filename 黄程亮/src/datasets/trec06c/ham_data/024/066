> I'm looking for a recommendation on a LEGO set to buy for use with my Handy Board. I'm looking for a set with a reasonable number of pieces, gears, wheel and stuff to build a simple robot. I already have some motors and micro switches, I just need to build a chassis to support my "creation".

Looking through the Lego Shop-At-Home catalog (1-800-453-4652), it looks
like the best deal for a starter robotics kit would be the Universal Set
with Storage Case (#8062) for $68.  Not that you would need the case,
but it has a bunch of general purpose pieces, an assortment of gears and
pulleys, and six medium-sized wheels.  The second-best would be the
Giant Model Set (#8277) for $44.  It has the very useful longer beams,
but it has smaller wheels and few gears.  The Gears & Differentials
assortment (#5229) can be added for $4.50.  BTW, the Mini Motor (#5225)
for $17.50 is a compact, efficient gear motor that runs well directly
off the HB.  Shipping is free.  (Note:  I don't get any kind of kickback
from Lego--I'm just a big fan).
 
> Also, how do you interface a random DC motor with the LEGO gears? Can I just take one small gear and glue/epoxy it in place on the motor output? Is there another trick I should know about? (Sorry for the stupid questions, but I've never played/used LEGO before, unless you count playing DUPLO with the kids...)

The Lego gears are designed to press-fit onto the plastic Lego shafts,
which have a "+" cross-section.  To fit 'em to a round shaft, try gluing
a short section of shaft into the gear first (with epoxy?), then
drilling the appropriate size hole through the shaft.  If you glue a
Lego bushing onto the assembly before drilling, you might be able to
drill and tap a hole for a tiny set screw, too.

> What set are you using?

I'm using a bunch of sets that I've been collecting for years.  The big
one was the pneumatic claw rig for about $120, but I don't think they
sell it anymore.  It came with a motorized air compressor for the
pneumatics!  No matter how many sets I have, I still drool over the
catalogs.  If I didn't already have the HB, I would save up my meager
research assistant stipend to buy the Lego Mindstorms kit.

Hope this helps.  Good luck!
