if a sensor connector row looks like this --

  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
   6  5  4  3  2  1  0


then to connect to sensor 0, you plug the switch into the places
marked "[X]":

  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][X]

  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][X]
   6  5  4  3  2  1  0

In your message you said:
