Hy,

I just read the compass.asm file. I don't know very much about assembly
langage, but it seems that some of the motor commands are used in it. 
Can I still use the 4 (or a least 2) motors outputs to drive motors while
using the compass.
Are there any limitations induced by the use of this programm?


Thanks
