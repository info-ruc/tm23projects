There is the Micro Kernel from Jean J. Labrosse. It's a free kernel readily
available, also for the 68hc11. I have his book but haven't implemented the
full kernel yet, only parts of it. Its well written and cheap.

Subject:	RTOS for HB?

To me is seems, that multitasking futures of IC is very insufficient.
Is exist any small, inexpensive RTOS (real time operation system), that is
tested for HB?
I'm hear that RTXC,  RTEK or  MCX11 may be that RTOS.
Is anybody tested some RTOS with HB?
