Hi all,

I'm looking for a recommendation on a LEGO set to buy for use with my Handy Board. I'm looking for a set with a reasonable number of pieces, gears, wheel and stuff to build a simple robot. I already have some motors and micro switches, I just need to build a chassis to support my "creation".

Also, how do you interface a random DC motor with the LEGO gears? Can I just take one small gear and glue/epoxy it in place on the motor output? Is there another trick I should know about? (Sorry for the stupid questions, but I've never played/used LEGO before, unless you count playing DUPLO with the kids...) 

What set are you using?

Thanks,
-- Eric
