It sounds like you've got the switch between +5V and GND. What pins
exactly are you connecting to?

The sensor connections Are like this:

        _ _    _
        G +    I
        N 5    N
        D V    P

You dont need a resistor to use a microswitch.  The HB inputs have pull-up
resistors, so all you need to do is connect the input to GND to make it go
low.
