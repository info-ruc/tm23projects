You could do what they do for aquarium filter pumps -- use magnetic
transfer.  Put a bar type magnet on the motor shaft and put a similar magnet
on a propeller just outside the hull where the motor is.  Since propellers
require low-torque it works fine.  The main down side is that this type of
system can have problems starting up if clogged with crud.

I'm interested in building an underwater ROV and am wondering if anyone 
has any insight on buiding waterproof seals for the motors.(I'd like to 
eventually be able to go down 200 ft or so).

I realize this is a bit off topic but hope that someone may have some 
experience in the area. I will be using a handyboard communicating via 
SPI to a PC for the on board control and sensing.

Thanks,

Matthew Essar
