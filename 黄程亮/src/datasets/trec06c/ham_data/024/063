Jaron,

No offense taken here...I was just voting my support for Fred, no matter what
he wants to do.  I think he is an incredibly generous guy to answer my dumb
newbie questions. :)

I also subscribe to several newsgroups for hypothisizing (sp?):
comp.arch.embedded
comp.robotics.misc
sci.electronics.design
sci.engr.control

hope this helps,
Gerald.
