After reading the Vector 2X Manual a couple of times, it seems that the SDI
pin (Serial Data In) has no function. It is even stated in the manual that
this pin is never connected. If this is the case, couldn't we use the MISO pin
from the HandyBoard to control the P/C pin on the compass? This would free up
the motor output.
I'm not that familiar with the 6811 SPI, so I don't know if this would make
sense?
(What data would the HB be transmitting to the V2X anyway?)
Thanks again,
Dave
