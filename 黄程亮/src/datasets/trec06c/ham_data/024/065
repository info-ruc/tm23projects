The junk mail part is true, but I'm not sure how true it is that you need
Internet access to read newsgroup. You see, the dialup is regulated by a
server computer. This computer has different accessible ports. One of them
is the email port. Another one is the news port, which is port 119. So,
any thing with an email port should have a news port. Then news reader
does NOT do any transfer like HTTP (which would be internet). Rather, it
acts like an email client and connects to the server the same way an email
program does, just on a diffrent port. Heck, I think that even the
protocols are similar!
