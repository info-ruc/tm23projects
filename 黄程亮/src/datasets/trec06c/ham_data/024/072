Hello. I don't know if it's proper to introduce yourself on this list or
not, so I'll just say I'm new here, and new to electronics in general. Lego
Mindstorms came out and got me interested, but I decided I wanted a more
hands on experience.

Anyway, quick questions about parts. The list says it wants 0.1uF monolithic
caps, with Digikey part #P4917-ND. I couldn't find this part in the catalog,
and I think I had problems ordering something similar for building a
miniboard. Part #P4923-ND is an 0.1uF mono cap, but it says it's 50v. Is
this what's needed, or do I need a lower or higher voltage? Also, a bridge
rectifier with part #DB101-ND is called for. In the catalog I found part
#DB101DI-ND. Is this acceptable?

Thanks in advance.

Kris
