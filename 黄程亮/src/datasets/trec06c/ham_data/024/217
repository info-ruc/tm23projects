It seems to give me a reading relative to the sensor distance from a surface, but not always... And sometime I got "close" reading when I'm actually really far from any surface...

The results you get from a reflective IR sensor will vary quite a lot
depending on surface color, roughness, angle of incidence, electrical
noise, etc.  My IR sensors were not good for much of anything besides
encoders, where the surface characteristics are controlled.

One technique that I use to filter noisy sensor data is to return the
median of three successive sensor readings.  This works extremely well
for the Polaroid sonar sensors for example, where an occasional huge
error can mess up other averaging schemes.

Hope this helps.  Good luck!

Wendy Parson,             If you can find something everyone agrees on,
Will Bain,                                                  it's wrong.
