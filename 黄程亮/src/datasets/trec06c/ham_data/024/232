  See nowadays what happened:<BR><BR>&#149; Rising gold prices are further accelerating 
  this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and 
  this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted 
  for inflation.)</p>
<p>&#149; HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been 
  estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.</p>
<p>&#149; China is the world&#146;s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked 
  away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China&#146;s 
  rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.</p>
<p>&#149; China is already the world&#146;s 4th largest producer of gold &#151; 
  and will soon be the world&#146;s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is 
  going gold-crazy!</p>
<p>&#149; Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed 
  to provide full legal protection.<BR>CURRENT NEWS: China Gold Corp. Announces

  In the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil, but a foolish man devours all he has One man's meat is another man's poison.. Bread is the staff of life Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy  Doubt is the beginning not the end of wisdom Perfection is inperfect You can't teach an old dog new.. math. He That Will Not Be Counselled Cannot Be Helped He who awaits much receives little Beauty without virtue is a flower without perfume Grease is the only cure for a hangover 
  Let sleeping dogs lie. When a fool is silent, he too is counted among the wise What goes up must come down Every man has his price The road to hell is paved with good intentions A clear conscience is usually the sign of a bad memory.  War does not always decide who it right but it always decides who is left! Beautiful is not what is beautiful, but what one likes  God gives every bird its food, but does not always drop it into the nest  Yuh gat fuh blow yuh nose where yuh stump yuh toe.	 There is more than one way to skin a cat 
  What goes up must come down Many hands make light work Charity covers a multitude of sins <br>
