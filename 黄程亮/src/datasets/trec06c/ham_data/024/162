Sorry to intrude,  I would like to check with people of this list if any
one have used the NEC V40 ucontroller before.  I'm doing a project on
this and have problem programming the timer and intrl3.  Kind reply to
me personally at   choykm@singnet.com.sg.

Please do not reply thru this list as not to inconvenience user of this
list.

Thanks in advance
