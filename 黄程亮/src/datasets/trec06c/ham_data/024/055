Subject: Inconsistent startup

I'm trying to get a minimal 68hc11 board to run in single chip mode. After
I download the code and switch to run mode, pushing reset works fine. The
problem is when a startup in run mode, this Line of text comes up in my
terminal emulator. "BUFFALO 3.2 (int) - Bit User Fast Friendly Aid To
Logical Operation" It usually takes 3 resets to get my program to run. How
do I get the MCU to run my program at startup?

One other Question. What directive do I need to use for the as11 assembler
to recognize values as data and not generate an error?

Thanks.
