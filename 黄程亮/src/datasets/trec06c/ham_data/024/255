I tend to agree.  Most people think that if the display is dead, the system is
dead.  The fact that you can download the program is a good sign.  I think, you
then need to prove that it was downloaded using simple known commands to
establish that it is listening, returning information, etc.  The art of
troubleshooting is not only what does not work, but more importantly what does.

Can you turn on various ports (motors)?  Does the system react the same each
time you reboot?  Can you read switches on the input port?  You do not have to
replace anything until you get an understanding of the limits of the failure.
