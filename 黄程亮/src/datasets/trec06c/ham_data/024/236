Ok,

I found the link to the Expansion board info website...it's all about a beta
version.  But, there appears to be enough information there for me to build
one myself.  (is that what everyone's done?)  I have never built something
from scratch like this, so I was hoping to find someplace that would sell me
the printed PCB and the components...or, I could scrounge the components from
the sources mentioned.

Q1:  Anyone have any PCB's for sale for the Expansion Board?
Q2:  Anyone know how much all the parts cost?

Thanks!
Gerald.
