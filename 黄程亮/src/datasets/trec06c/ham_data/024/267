hi all,

i have trouble with my handy-board.

Few days ago it works proberly, now i doesn=B4t go into the
bootstrap modus. Both leds (red+green) lights and i can=B4t download the
pcode.

I tested the board with and without the serial interface. But it doesn=B4=
t

work it didn=B4t go into the bootstrapmode.

Sometimes it works without the serialinterface, the hb changed into the
bootstrap mode but most times it didn=B4t work :-(


what can i do ?

thanx bernd klein
