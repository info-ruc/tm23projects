Well maybe you should try replacing the HC11 for a start.. These things tend
to spoil easily and for no apparent reason.... :( (or is it just bad luck?)
That's funny, you shorted out something and it still can download?
Maybe you should also change the RAM chip for good measure.

Anyway does anyone know if I can use a NVRAM module (Dallas DS1230) in place
of the SRAM now so I don't have to use a battery just to keep the RAM
contents?
