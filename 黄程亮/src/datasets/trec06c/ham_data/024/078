Hi All,
Thanks  a lot for the help.
I just dont know what we would do without this mail list!!

All you need is a little direction when things are going wrong.
I had switched  cables from my 6.270 board.

THANKS A MILLION GUYS.

Choo, The v2x compass is great,I can't write code very well as of now but I
have it reading the compass following instructions from it.
Thanks to Tom Bruesehaver for his work.
It still "hangs up" every now and then reading 0's but there are
instructions how to fix.
See arcives at 5-12-97 and 5-19-97. Please let me know if I can help.
