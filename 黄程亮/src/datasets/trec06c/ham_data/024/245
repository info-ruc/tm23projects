Sounds like a lot of it is still up and running if you can download.

I'd suggest going through the assembly instructions and performing the
tests at the end of each section.  You should, thereby, be able to isolate
smaller areas that may be fried and hence improve your chances of saving
your board.  Otherwise, take a look at the schematics and use them as a map
of the circuits that were involved in your short. 

Sorry this is so general, but it's hard to be more specific without knowing
exactly what part of the board the other end of the wire was on...

Good Luck,
	Owen
