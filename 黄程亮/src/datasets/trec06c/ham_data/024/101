Hi,
any LCD Display 2*16 with a Hitachi HD44780 Controller will do.
There are several retailers. But I do not know about the UK.
Batron, Rohm (the HB original) are just two producers of LCD Displays.
I needed some LCD's (same as on HB) myself and ordered them from Rohm
(http://www.rohm.com/overview/europe.html).

Bye

Tom
