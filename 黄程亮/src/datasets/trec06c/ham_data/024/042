you are using the wrong kind of RJ11 cable.  See the FAQ question

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#rj11

under the heading "The R11 on my Interface/Charger board is smoking
hot and is turning black!  What is wrong?"

Always check the FAQ, there is a lot of good stuff in there,
Fred
