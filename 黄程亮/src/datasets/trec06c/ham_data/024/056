Unless Fred knows any different and 2 days is an accurate time I would
suggest changing your ISP as I have always received the mailing list
copy of any messages that I have sent within 30 minutes of being sent.

Also a news group would require this part of internet access whereas
most people have access to email (mine is at work so reading emails is
allowed but internet access is restricted) not every body would want to
or be able to access a news group. So in my opinion the mailing list is
better, and we hardly ever get junk mail (I don't remember seeing any
within the last year).

John
