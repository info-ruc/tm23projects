One thing that was discussed before (I think on this mailing list?) that I
thought was pretty cool was a small robot with a microphone (FM wireless
mike perhaps?) and a photocell.  It would stay in the shadows while
trying to get close to people speaking.  Bump sensors and/or ultrasonics
sensors would also be nice to keep it from running into things much.
