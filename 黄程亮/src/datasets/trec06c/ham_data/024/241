I didn't look that closely at your program but I have included a routine to
read the analog ports that I know works.

After assembling and loading the program, you make two c function calls:
powerup_ad(); and read_ad(i); where i is the analog port address you want to
read.

Best wishes,

"HI" , I am trying to read the A/D converter but the program gets "Hung-Up"
on the line ...
