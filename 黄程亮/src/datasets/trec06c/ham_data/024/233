Hi All,
While I was building my sumo robot I managed to short a wire in my HB.
I put a wire that was connected to a multimeter and also connected to
another part of the robot, into a digital sensor input, sparks came out
and it smelt like burnt electronics.  I checked over the board and there
was no physical damage that I could see.  I downloaded IC and when I
reset it didn't say "Welcome to interactive c  blah blah blah", like it
usually does, the LCD just stayed the same, all full bars on top row and
all clear on the bottom.  There is obviously something wrong and I was
wondering if anyone may know of any quick tests or fixes for this sort
of problem.  Thanks for any help
