SPARTAN 201 will be carried into orbit by the space shuttle on Mission
STS-95 which has a launch date scheduled for 29 October 1998, 19:00 UT.
The payload for SPARTAN Mission 201-5 consists of a White Light Coronagraph
(WLC) provided by NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center and an Ultraviolet Coronal
Spectrometer (UVCS) provided by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.

SP201 will be deployed on 1 November 18:46 UT and retrieved on 3 November
20:30 UT. The duration of the SPARTAN flight is almost two days (43.5 hours).
Deployment is planned to occur 71 hours, 46 minutes after launch. Primary
targets are the north polar hole and the adjacent streamers surrounding the
polar coronal holes.   The primary goals of the SPARTAN 201-5 mission 
is to study the physical properties of the corona and to update the absolute 
radiometric calibrations for two of the coronagraphs on the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) spacecraft:SOHO/UVCS and SOHO/LASCO. 

Coordinates for the targets will be announced 28 hours before deployment.
Updates of the coordinates may be issued at 12 and possibly 8 hours prior to
deployment. Once deployed, SPARTAN automatically executes the pre-programmed
maneuvers on each target.  The current primary targets for this flight are the
north polar hole and streamers on the east and west limbs.  The location of
the fourth target will probably be in the south coronal hole.  Space-based
observations from instruments on SOHO and Yohkoh will be used to identify
transient activity as late as 8 hours prior to deployment.

Additional supporting observations from prominence monitors, 
coronagraphs, and interplanetary scintillation arrays
can provide useful correlative measurements of temperature, density and
velocity diagnostics of the lower and upper corona.  In particular, synoptic
observations of coronal and photospheric/chromospheric features  FOR ONE WEEK
BEFORE AND AFTER the flight will be very useful in determining the three
dimensional structure of the coronal features.  Magnetic and H-alpha 
observations are useful in determining large-scale magnetic field
patterns. 


A tentative timeline showing actual times and true position angles will be
made available on 30 October 1998, two days prior to the SPARTAN deployment.
A FINAL timeline of the SPARTAN observations will be sent out on the day of 
SPARTAN deployment.
