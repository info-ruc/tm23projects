hello,

i am trying to send a data array to my PC from the handyboard thru the
serial cable.  a couple months ago, i was advised to use a terminal
emulator to capture the data.  this has not worked, however.  i was told
about using a null modem cable when attempting such a task, and i am
wondering how this works, and if it is the correct method.  also, can
anyone recommend a good terminal emulator?  thank you.
