Dear Sir,
      Iam getting started with my project. At our lab we are having 
freeware version of IC (version 2.8). We tried to install the commercial 
version 3.2, but we are facing some problems. We tried to install from 
the site you told i.e http://www.newtonlabs.com/ic/ic_download.html
Can you please help us how to install it by step by step.
thanking you sir,
Madhusudan Gaddamidi
