Respected Sir,
           I have installed the newer version of IC into my PC. My 
Handyboard is ready with all parts assembled. Earlier I have done a 
project called "Mobile Robot Navigation of a Maze" with this handyboard. 
In this the robot navigates the maze and comes out of this successfully. 
I have implemented "Wall Fallowing Algorithm".I have to start another 
project with the same Handy Board. So I request your suggestion about 
any Algorithm you suggest or any problem you can suggest for this 
Handyboard mobile robot.
 
Thanking You Sir,
Madhusudan Gaddamidi
