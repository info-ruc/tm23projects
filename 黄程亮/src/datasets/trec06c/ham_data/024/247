I can not get the sensors to respond correctly, for instance if I do
analog(0) the value of the sensor marked 7 on the hb is returned. After
going through all the sensors here is the layout I came up with:
I never got a reading on port 0,1,9 or 10

analog(x)         returns a value from the hb sensor marked
0                        7
1                        8
2                        12
3                        13
4                        14
5                        15
6                        start button
7                        Stop button
8                        4
9                        5
10                        6
11                        pot
12                        3
13                        2
14                        8
15                        4(dup)

Everything else seems to working correctly.
Any ideas what could be causing this?

Julian
