I used to work at AOL technical support, I would be very much interested if
you could figure out how to use AOL as a POP3, AOL is NOT a POP3 server.
AOL is very proprietery, one of the many reasons (and doesn't support DUN -
dial-up networking) that AOL isn't very good.  One thing that you can do,
which is still very unacceptable, is to go to www.aol.com and follow the
links for AOL Netmail, you can use this rather pathetic feature to check
your mail w/o having your AOL software loaded on the machine.  This BTW
doesn't support NT 4.0.
