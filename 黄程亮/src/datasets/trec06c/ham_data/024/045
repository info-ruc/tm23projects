Howdy Fred and all others,

I still enjoy the HandyBoard mailing-list a lot.
So much that I would like some easier way to use it. 
Is there a reason this group is not on a news server (too)?
In my humble opinion this would allow faster responses.
And with it strengthen the bond between handyboarders worldwide.
At the cost of flames and spam though.

Groetjes,
