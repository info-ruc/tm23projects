I am aiming on using the 16x2 LCD from Maplins (part number DK63T, 8.89
pounds + vat, model number LM016L). I don't know of hand if the pin
layout is the same as the LM052L listed in the parts list but as I am
going to be using a connecting lead this is not a problem for me but it
may be worth finding out if you are intending mounting it on the board.

Hope this helps.
