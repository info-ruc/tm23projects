Erm... not quite.  I much prefer an email based distribution.  I don't
access the net interactively that often.  I just queue up my mail, and my
computer autonomously purges each evening while I sleep.  If the
handyboard list were a newsfeed, I would be required, at the very least,
to set up yet another process that bulk acquires the latest postings, as
well as my mail.  Worse case, I would have to bring up an interactive
session and tie up my phone line to access the latest HB postings.  Thank
you, no.

just my (010)b cents.
