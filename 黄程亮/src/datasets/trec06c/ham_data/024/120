Subject: waterproof seals (a bit OT)
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Fri, 16 Oct 1998 07:20:06 PDT

I'm interested in building an underwater ROV and am wondering if anyone 
has any insight on buiding waterproof seals for the motors.(I'd like to 
eventually be able to go down 200 ft or so).

I realize this is a bit off topic but hope that someone may have some 
experience in the area. I will be using a handyboard communicating via 
SPI to a PC for the on board control and sensing.

Thanks,

Matthew Essar
