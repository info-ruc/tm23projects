I just got my HB and am trying to test the sensor input, the docs say to
hook up the microswitch between signal and ground, when I do this and close
the switch my hb resets (because I just shorted it out...).  I tried putting
a resistor (330 ohm) in the circuit this stopped the reset but I could not
get the switch to change states in ic, it is always 255. I am new to
electronics and appreciate any help you can give.
