Hello,
I need help with the file types used by the handyboard. There are c, asm, icb,
and lis files. How do I work with them? For example, I downloaded the
compass.icb and compass.c files from the HandyBoard Site. Do I need to
download both of them to the handy board in order for the program to work? I
just received my handyboard a few weeks ago, so I really don't know how to do
this. I have read the HandyBoard manual a couple of times, so I understand
what each file type is, but my problem is: what to do after I have them loaded
into the handyboard?
Any help is always appreciated.
Thanks,
Dave
