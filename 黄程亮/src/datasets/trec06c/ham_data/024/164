it's in the faq, at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#memmap

all you do is write to 0x4000, 0x5000, 0x6000 depending on whether
your latch is attached to Y0, Y2, or Y4 (respectively).  e.g.,
"poke(0x4000, 0xff);" will set all the bits of a latch attached to Y0
to 1.
