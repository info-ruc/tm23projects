After reviewing the Dr. Seuss Power Points I notice a few things that took away from the overall quality of the presentation.  I thought that I would send this out to remind you of these points.

1. Poor picture quality (many stretched out the pictures or enlarged them too far)
2. Many used bullets and had large amounts of information (please don't use bullets. If you have large amounts of information use more than one slide)
3. Many did not align their text to the left  (this needs to be done when you are typing next to the picture as well as above the picture)
4. Keep your presentation consistent through out.  Try and place you picture in similar areas from slide to slide.  Use the same font and the same size of font.

You all did a great job on using a San Serif font!!!

I hope this helps. If you have questions please email Carolyn or I. Have a great three day weekend.
