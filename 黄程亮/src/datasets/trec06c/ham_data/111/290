   Beyond getting another sound card or updating the drivers for your 
current sound card you could try it without the DigitalVOX and RecordVocal 
devices as almost anything weird with sound is usually related to 
them.  You could try putting another blank frame before the sound 
frame.  Do you really need a fixed delay between items?  I'd take it out 
before anything else.
