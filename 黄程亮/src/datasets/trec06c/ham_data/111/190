Good morning Thomas.

The error you are seeing is related to the Cflow.pm perl module. The 
module must be configured and compiled for use with flow-tools files. 
I'm not sure how to correctly install it when using a debian package of 
flow-tools. Using the flow-tools tarball, you would do the following:

untar the flow-tools tar.gz
cd flow-tools-0.66
cd contrib
tar -zxvf Cflow-1.051.tar.gz
cd Cflow-1.051
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

The Cflow Makefile will look for the flow-tools files itself. It expects 
to find them in the same folder path, so it's important to follow this 
exactly as described above.

Let us know how it goes.

Thanks, Robert

P.S. You'll find the same notes here near the bottom of the page.
