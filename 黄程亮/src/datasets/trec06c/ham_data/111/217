Thanks for the answer.

I keep on hitting "Test" but no polling results show up.
Only the coordinates.
In addition (though I don't know if this is relevant), when I try
different polling times in the id parameter, nothing seems to change in
the output. Not even with absurd polling times, like every 100 ms. I
still get results to the 100th of a ms (like 454.34) in the output file.

Since I can't get TimeDX to give me the polling time, I suppose I
shouldn't risk it, and buy a new pad, right?

Is an USB interrupt-driven gamepad the best choice? (apart from the PIO
thing) Or should I look for a polled one that is polled in a very short
time?

Thank you,

Joao
