I hope there's a simple answer to this.

I have the Q key mapped as a negative response, with the item line
ending with a 'branch if wrong' to the end of the script and that works
just fine.

However my user now wants an automatic timeout e.g. <t 4000> and when
timed out, go onto the next item. If I introduce that, I find that a
timeout acts as a wrong response, and branches to the end.

What am I doing wrong - I want 'Q' to go to the end, but a timeout to go
to the next item..

P.s. 'branch if no response'  may work instead of the timeout, but
requires me to edit every line of the script to tell it where the next
line is.
