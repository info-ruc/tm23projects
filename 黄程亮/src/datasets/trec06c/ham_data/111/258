Hi Patricia,
This is to approve the request of enclosed equipments (estimated to be
$75,000+) using SVC equipment funds. This request has been discussed with
Bob Vitale and has been developed in cooperation with him.
This request has also been discussed with TIM faculty and
they have given their approval as well.
If there are any questions, please feel free to reach me.
thanx,

Subject: request for equipments

Hi, Suresh,

Here is the budget estimation for the equipments. The goal of purchasing
these equipments is to set up a new facility - the Enterprise Management
Cockpit - which will promote the teaching and research of TIM by bringing
industry executives and other levels of Silicon Valley firms to UCSC
physically or virtually over tel-conferencing. It will also be used as TIM
teaching labs. The equipments will be located at E2-475.

Thanks,

Yi

Hi, Randy,

Thank you. You are making a very good point. Let's try to improved it. Can
you do a modification to open the window side of the rectangular (instead of
the long side as shown in OptionH) to set the curved lectern and add an
extra projection on the window side? This will accommodate 20 persons, and
people can see each other as well as the screen.

The general goals are:
1) every one can see each other
2) every one can see all of the screen (For goal 1, there will be two
displays of the screens to make sure all (or most) of the people can see all
of the screen. One is the long side as you put on the latest design, another
is on the window side.)
3) under the above constraint, maximize the nubmer of people. 

Thanks,

Yi

Yi,
Here is a new option based on the changes you request.  Keep in mind that the people at either end of the room will not be able to see some or all of the screens.

&gt; Hi, Randy,
&gt;
&gt; Thank you very much for these nice layouts. Option F is the best. Can you do
&gt; some modification to make it a one layer U shape? This will accommodate 16
&gt; persons, and people can see each other.
&gt; In general, it would be nice to make the room similar to room E2-599, except
&gt; 1) we use a curved lectern in front of the canvas; 2) the room is smaller;
&gt; 3) the computing facilities Bob will set up will be more advanced.
&gt; For the furniture, let's consider standard and cherry wood. If there is any
&gt; extra cost for cherry wood furniture, please give an estimation of it. I
&gt; will present both options and to all ISTM faculty for all of us to make a
&gt; decision which one to choose from.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks,
&gt;
&gt; Yi



Yi,
Attached are seven alternative layouts for the ISTM Cockpit.  They are very preliminary, of course.  Options F and G differ only in the shape of the lectern.  A curved lectern is probably not within the E2 furniture budget and will likely require additional funding.

One of the most important questions to address is how many people does the room need to accommodate.  Ram originally asked for 20.  Twenty appears to be do-able, but very tight.

The layouts show the marker boards but not the projection screens, which will be located  6-8" from the wall.

Feel free to suggest entirely different arrangements.

Thanks.
Randy

Bob,

Thank you and Yi for the follow through.

As Yi is suggesting, I am providing more details:
   * Randy Porter has a layout design for the Cockpit furniture; this might give a better visual starting point
   * This layout has executives/students sitting around in a horse shoe or oval table (or recatngular arrangement): about 20
   * Each person would have a common screen to view and then project on to 3-4 displays on the walls, and a second that only he/she can use and see - consider a VP of Engineering sharing the end results with others executives an dthe CEO, but running detailed calculations on his liminted domain screen. We need 10-20 of these to start with.
   * We need associated 10-20 desktops or laptops - students can use these for developing code etc., when the cockpit is not being for executives and student teaching
   * We need to ensure that the footprint and communication of all the applications/modules of Oracle, SAP etc. work in our environment (adequacy of RAM etc.)
------------
NASA has two interesting elements you might like  to visit and look at:
   i. a HUGE local screen - very convenient in the cockpit context for an individual for viewing multiple windows and connections - used by a budget/legal person Sonia Lau
   i. A touch screen, and a software platform they have developed, including an Oralce database, which they are using for Program Management (I provided the PMT URL in my writeup), to support 10,000 NASA personnel, including knowledge management

   * You also had budgeted several video screen drivers/controllers
   * We need (multiple) viewing panel/screen controls at the Cockpit table/chairs

   * I still need to connect with SAP and Oracle and am waiting for some other call backs in this regard, to obtain more detail
   * Cisco has a cockpit: I am not quite sure what it looks like or whether they will let us see it
