Dear friend,

Not only reaching, but also empowering, women is the second goal of the
Microcredit Summit Campaign.=20

Women are not a secondary or marginal constituency in micro-finance:=20

-        Globally they are the majority of the world's population and =
over
70% of the poor.=20

-        In some countries women's enterprises are growing faster than =
those
of men.=20

-        Moreover micro-finance does have significant potential to =
challenge
and change the gender inequalities which prevent women from improving =
their
livelihoods for themselves and their families.

-        Evidence of much higher female repayment rates has led many
programmes to target women. Most programmes attempt at least 50% women
clients.

=20

However, gender strategies in micro finance need to look beyond just
increasing
women's access to savings and credit to look strategically at how
programmes can actively promote gender equality and women's
empowerment. This includes not only addressing gender concerns in
product design, but also non-financial services, group and
organisational structure, staffing policy and advocacy.=20


A new discussion group has been started as a complement to=20

the genfinance website sponsored by Aga
Khan Foundation Canada http://www.genfinance.info=20
to enable international exchange of experience and ideas on 'gender
best practice'. This includes a chat facility for online discussions.

=20

The aim is to focus in much more detail than has so far been done in=20

many E-mail discussions on specific areas of programme design.=20

This could if members wish focus on specific topics each month.=20

Please just send your ideas to the group.=20

=20

As a means of starting some discussion I have pasted a question about
savings.

=20

Please join the group discussion
http://finance.groups.yahoo.com/group/genfinance/ .=20

Or if you feel you already belong to too many groups and prefer to =
respond
as part of this one,=20

I hope you will not mind my crosspasting.

=20

Hoping to hear from you,

Linda=20

=20

If you have any problems/questions about joining the group please let me
know.

Savings for women

=20

For many women, including very poor women, savings facilities are as
important in increasing amounts of income under their control as are =
loans.


=20

However savings products are often designed more in order to increase
programme financial sustainability or as a moral commitment to 'thrift',
than in the best interests of clients. It cannot be assumed that savings
programmes necessarily benefit women:

=20

- Women may already have a range of effective ways of saving and NGO =
savings
programmes may be imposing a less efficient way of saving on women,
particularly where savings are a condition of loans. =20

- Savings programmes may detract resources from indigenous savings =
groups
which often provide a safety net for very poor women from the funds of =
other
group members e.g. 'trouble funds' in West Africa.     - Savings are
foregone investment and/or consumption and may therefore harm both =
women's
ability to increase profits or their nutrition and health.=20

=20

It is particularly important that women do not become solely responsible =
for
saving within the household leaving men's responsibilities and =
contributions
unquestioned. Some programmes appear to see women as a 'soft option' for
getting savings and make little attempt to encourage men to save. There =
is a
danger that some Savings and Credit Cooperatives, particularly where =
women
are the main savers but underrepresented  as borrowers and on
decision-making bodies, perform the rather dubious function of   =
recycling
poor women's savings as low-interest loans to (often better-off) men.=20

=20

Women's own needs and existing strategies therefore must be carefully
examined before designing any savings programme.

=20

How much do we actually know about the effects of different types of =
savings
products on women's enterprises/livelihoods, gender equality within the
household and the other assumed benefits? What are the best types of
products for which women in which contexts?=20

=20

From my own consultancy it is clear that in some contexts women appear =
to
prefer compulsory to voluntary savings as a means of ensuring their =
ability
to protect incomes against the demands of husbands.=20

=20

I would very much like to hear other peoples' views/experience of =
different
types of savings product. And particularly details of any impact
assessments.

=20
