   You must be hitting the button that tests the device as a touch screen, 
the coordinates only update when the lower buttons are used.  Use the test 
button at the top of the dialog.

   Yeah, but it was only polled once every 100ms, DMDX is still going to 
display the exact time it was polled at.  If however it's actually a 
interrupt driven device DMDX is ignoring the polling commands.

   I don't think you're using TimeDX correctly, we'll see what happens when 
you use the right commands.

   Interrupt driven would be my choice.  I suspect however
