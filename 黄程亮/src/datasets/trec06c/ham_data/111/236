Hi Michael,
I'm in Northeast Ohio, Green specifically (about an hour from 
Cleveland).

I discovered last night, while working with my IIfx, I was resetting 
the PRAM incorrectly, as embarrassing as that is.  I was also holding 
down the Control key, which apparently some Macs don't like.  Most work 
with this combination, in my experience.

I'll try resetting again, and maybe anything else I can think of.

Thanks,
Kyle-
By the way, sorry if I'm being annoying or sounding short-tempered, but 
I've been dealing with one Genesis for about 10 months now.
