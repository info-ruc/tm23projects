Dear Romanian Club Board Members,
My name is Kseniya Shelkovskaya, and I am writing on the behalf of
Columbia Television (CTV).
CTV network broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and 365 days a
year. CTV is flushing out our schedule with brand new original
programming. From short films, to original series; from Basketball
to political speakers; CTV is the place to find it all.
Romanian Club made a great impression on me when I read about you
online, and it would be amazing if we could have your club
represented on our channel. If you there are any upcoming projects
that you feel are particularly interesting and you would like us to
tape, or you already have tapes of the past events, we will edit and
air them. While Columbia community will be getting an exciting and
engaging show, Romanian Club will be getting free exposure and
promotion.
Not only will Romanian Club get a chance to be on TV (Channel 37),
your friends and family anywhere in the world will be able to watch
on the Internet (www.columbia.edu/cu/ctv).
If there are no events that you would want us to tape, but you are
interested in working with us, or have any questions, concerns, or
suggestions, feel free to contact me at ctv-campus@columbia.edu.
Thank you so much in advance, and have a wonderful break,



Kseniya Shelkovskaya
