Geochemical Transactions has had a troubled history. Four lackluster  
years hosted by the Royal Society of Chemistry led to a transfer to  
the American Institute of Physics. AIP opted out due to a continuing  
dearth of manuscript submissions over the last two years.
With volume 7, the editorial board is trying a new tact. The journal  
is moving to BioMed Central and adopting an author pays [UK pounds  
800, Euros 1185, US$1410], Open Access publishing model. Officially  
the move is effective on 1 January 2006. Currently, the new website  
has an announcement of the purchase of all of the backfiles (funded  
by the ACS Geochemistry division) and an editorial on the new vision  
for the journal.

Geochemical Transactions forward as an open access journal.  
Geochemical Transactions 2006, 7:1. doi:10.1186/1467-4866-7-1

Geochemical Transactions, the first online-only journal in  
geochemistry and environmental chemistry, is now the first major open  
access journal in this subject area. All issues of Geochemical  
Transactions, including the back content, will be fully and  
permanently available online to all, without a subscription charge.  
Copyright of all future articles will be retained by the authors.  
Geochemical Transactions remains the official journal of the Division  
of Geochemistry of the American Chemical Society. The generous  
support of the Division has made it possible to make the back content  
available without a subscription charge.
As the impact factor demonstrates (1.941), the content has been  
strong, even if the flow of articles has been meager. The journal has  
never received a noticeable push from the American Chemical Society.  
The Geochemistry Division of the American Chemical Society has done a  
poor job recruiting submissions from its own members, but perhaps,  
the journal has finally turned the corner.
