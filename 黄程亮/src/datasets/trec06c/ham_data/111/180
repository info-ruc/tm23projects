hi ml,

i am new to this list and cuflow.

i am running
a linksys wrt54gl with dd-wrt v23 12/25/2005 and started rflow on this
router to a flow-tools 0.67.8 from debian sarge.
this flow-capture does capture the databases fine. imho without nexthop
and outif. a flow-print file looks like:


srcIP            dstIP            prot  srcPort  dstPort  octets     
packets
193.27.253.47    192.168.0.98   6     8080     1188     126         2
192.168.0.98   193.27.253.47    6     1188     8080     110         2
193.27.253.2     192.168.0.98   6     80       1216     3979        10
192.168.0.98   193.27.253.2     6     1216     80       2695        10

when i run flowscan with the CUFlow report i get:

2006/01/13 00:35:24 working on file
/var/flow/test/ft-v05.2006-01-13.000000+0100...

cause i had before some other troubles and got:

ERROR updating /var/flow/rrd/total.rrd: illegal attempt to update using
time 1137106800 when last update time is 1137106800 (minimum one second
step)

ERROR updating /var/flow/rrd/total.rrd: illegal attempt to update using
time 1137106800 when last update time is 1137106800 (minimum one second
step)

i tried running flowscan with a user without the privilege to delete the
file, cause somebody said the file got deleted by something while
getting processed by CUFlow. 
https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/bboard/mj/cuflow-users/archive/2005_08/msg00005.html

but with this i saw the problem with not having a complete version 5
flow-export

is there a way to get CUFlow running without the complete flow-file?
cause it is enough for me, to get the packets/time/bytes for some subnet
as a graphical output?

greetings
thomas
