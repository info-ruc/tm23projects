Hello, all.

I'm trying to set up a masked priming experiment using an USB Logitech
Wingman Precision gamepad (not a joystick).

In the Input Device section in TimeDX, the device is properly
recognized, but it doesn't say "polled device" or the polling time.
It doesn't say it is interrupt-driven either (like it does for the
keyboard and the mouse.

Instead, I get a pair of coordenates, like (0, 65565) that change with
the directional axis.

Does this mean the device is not polled and that I should get rid of it?

If that is the case, can anyone recomend a gamepad that works?

Thanks a lot,

Joao Verissimo
