TOPICS IN THE BLACK EXPERIENCE: Transgressing Female
Gendered-Sexualities
tUESDAYS 6:10-8:00pm Dr. Jill Humphries=20

This exploratory course examines Black female gendered-sexuality from a
transnational perspective.  Drawing primarily from a social science
perspective we will examine the theoretical, conceptual, historical, and
socio-cultural context in which race, gender, and sexuality are used as
analytical concepts.  Using new media technology we will also explore
the fluidity of these concepts as social constructions that shape and
influence our notions about women of Afro-descent as racialized gendered
sexual beings.=20



AFAS G4080/002 CALL #94267=20
TOPICS IN THE BLACK EXPERIENCE:  BLACK WEST: AFRICAN AMERICAN ARTISTS IN
THE WESTERN UNITED STATES=20
THURSDAYS 4:10-6:00PM DR. KELLIE JONES=20

This course considers the creative production of African Americans
primarily in California in the 19th and 20th centuries.  Of interest are
the graphic and photographic works of Grafton Tyler Brown and J.P. Ball
and the narratives of black cowboys in the 19th century.  Moving to the
20th century we will consider sculpture by Beulah Ecton Woodard and
Sargent Johnson and architecture by Paul Williams and their relationship
to modern themes and theory, particularly that of the Harlem
Renaissance.  We will also look at African American connection to the
film industry through black westerns like The Bronze Buckaroo, Harlem
Rides the Range, and Two Gun Man from Harlem all from the 1930s.  In the
contemporary period we will explore the work of artists in dialogue with
the Black Arts Movement including Betye Saar, Charles White, David
Hammons, and Senga Nengudi.  Themes pertinent to the course include: how
are African American identities and cultural production imbricated with
concepts of what is considered "western" or trends of west coast
artmaking?; what can these artists tell us about notions of space,
place, and migration in the African American imagination?
