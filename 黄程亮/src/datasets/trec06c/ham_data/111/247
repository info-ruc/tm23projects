                           Virtual Savings Conference
        "Serving Small Depositors: Meeting Demand While Managing Costs"


      No fees, no travel, you're invited! From December 5th through December
      9th, CGAP and MicroSave are sponsoring a virtual conference on savings
        mobilization.  Facilitated by Madeline Hirschland, senior managers
       from leading financial institutions including FinComun, Equity Bank,
       and SafeSave will discuss their experience serving small depositors.
                    The conference will be conducted by email.

          You are invited to simply listen in or to contribute your own
      experience with deposit mobilization. To register for the conference,
                          simply send a blank e-mail to:

                                savingsconference-subscribe@yahoogroups.com

          The virtual conference will focus on the following questions:

       -   What are the keys to managing the costs of deposit mobilization?

         -   What mix of products can an institution offer to attract the
                 balance of low-cost stable funds that it needs?

          -   What delivery options (such as mobile vehicles, mobile phone
          banking, deposit collectors or satellite offices) are the most
         effective means to bring services close enough to poor and rural
                                   depositors?

        -   What types of marketing will most effectively inspire depositors
            to trust and deposit their savings with our institutions?

       -    What types of external factors (regulatory frameworks, payment
           systems, supervisory bodies, technical assistance, liquidity
            management mechanisms, etc.) are most helpful to financial
           institutions that have or seek to develop deposit services?

        Ten participants in the conference will receive a free copy of the
        just-released book, Savings Services for the Poor: An Operational
                     Guide, written by experts in the field.

                       We look forward to your joining us!
