Hello, all.

Welcome back.

If you are intending to complete your MA degree this semester, you must =
enroll in the MA thesis-writing tutorial (G5005). Please do so as soon =
as possible so I know who you are (this will help with sending out =
e-mails, etc).

Also, please consult with me to make sure that you have fulfilled all of =
your requirements (seminar requirements, distribution requirements, and =
language requirements). I will be in my office (408J Philosophy) every =
afternoon this week, and I can also be reached by e-mail.

All the best,

Amanda
