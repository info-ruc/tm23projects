I'd just use a <call> in every item and have it do the branching with a 
<MultiWayBranch>.  Something like:

0 "instructions" <bu 1000>;
~1 <mwb binr 2, biw 9999>;
~2 <return>;

+1000 "probe" * <call 1>;
+1001 "probe" * <call 1>;
+1002 "probe" * <call 1>;
+1003 "probe" * <call 1>;
+1004 "probe" * <call 1>;

9999 "end";
