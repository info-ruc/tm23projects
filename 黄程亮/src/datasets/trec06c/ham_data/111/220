hi robert,

thanx for the information. the problem depends on debian-bug
http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=3D327367
the maintainer compiled libcflow-perl before flow-tools :(
this bug is at least up to debian sarge 3.1r1, it got fixed in testing
(for etch), but didnt want to upgrade, cause libc would also get exchange=
d.

so i downloaded flow-tools-0.68 and compiled (quick and dirty) Cflow.pm,
but your checklist is not complete.

untar the flow-tools tar.gz
cd flow-tools-0.68
configure                                   <--
make                                          <--
cd contrib
tar -zxvf Cflow-1.051.tar.gz
cd Cflow-1.051
perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

afterwards i delete /usr/lib/perl5/Cflow.pm and linked
/usr/lib/perl5/Cflow.pm to /usr/local/lib/perl/5.8.4/Cflow.pm

afterwards flow-scan and CUFlow worked fine.

thanx robert

cu
thomas
