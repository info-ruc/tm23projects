We have scheduled a speaker, Michael Franzese, for Monday, January 16th in 
the Pitman room.   Michael is a former mob boss who will be speaking about 
gambling.  I realize that this is Martin Luther King holiday, but it is 
scheduled at 7:30 pm to accommodate basketball practice and those who are 
returning from a long weekend.  This is a mandatory event.
I have attached his website so you can know more about him...I think you 
will find him interesting.
