UofO Athletics Duckling Fund raiser at Papa's Pizza on Wed. January 
18th, 2006.  You must bring the flier to participate.

The University of Oregon Student Athlete Advisory Committee has taken 
Bailey Santana (Amanda Santana's (UofO Track team) little sister) 
under their wing and declared her their UO Duckling.  And will be 
sponsoring events throughout the year to help raise money for Bailey 
and her family.  One of these events is coming up very soon!

On Wednesday Jan. 18th Papa's Pizza Parlor on Coburg road is helping 
the UofO Student Athlete Advisory Committee sponsor an event to help 
raise money for Bailey.

There will be fliers at the front desk of the Casanova Center as well 
as the Student Services office.  By bringing this flier to Papa's 
Pizza on Jan. 18th the fund will receive 50% of the value of the food 
you purchase!!!  You must have the flier when you go to Papa's!
