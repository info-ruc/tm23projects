Dear DMDX users,

If you run any sort of naming experiments, in which you collect vocal
responses using RecordVocal from DMDX, you have faced the problem of
listening to all the responses in order to determine which ones are
correct.  You may also have wanted to check the response times given by
the voice key (VOX), in cases of mis-triggering, late triggering etc.
This is cumbersome and time-consuming to do with generic audio
applications.

I have written a short program in Python which will play out the
recorded responses and display the waveforms along with the timing
marks and corresponding correct responses, so you can move on to the
next trial with only one click (if the RT is correct) or two (if not).
This program makes it extremely rapid to go through a large set of
subject data. It is designed to be failsafe and can resume if
interrupted for any reason. It produces an RT file, one row per
subject, that can be directly read into a spreadsheet or statistical
program for analysis.

I have already successfully used the program for a couple of
experiments. If you think it might be useful to you and are willing to
provide detailed feedback, especially in case of problems, I would be
happy to mail the code and instructions to you (the only reason I am
not attaching it to this message is because attachments to the list
are not allowed).  Once a sufficient set of testers has determined
that the program is bug-free and useful I would be happy to see it
uploaded somewhere publicly available for any DMDX user to download.
