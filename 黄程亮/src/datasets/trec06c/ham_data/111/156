Subject: Another Daystar...
Date: Wed, 11 Jan 2006 17:10:12 -0500
X-Mailer: Apple Mail (2.623)

Hi all,
I have received another Daystar Genesis.  It is the 6-PCI slot kind, 
and has a 132MHz 604 (from a 7200 or similar, I believe).  I have a 
hard drive, CD drive, and video card for it, as well as RAM.  This 
computer, however, does the exact same thing as my other genesis - it 
chimes, spins up the drive, and sits there.  Nothing else.  I have 
tried all kinds of things - moving the card around, swapping from 3dfx 
to IMS Twin Turbo (in slots 2 and 4 from processor), I have tried 
changing RAM around - how should it be installed?  I have five 128MB 
sticks of RAM, and an 8 mB stick from a PowerMac 5400.  I was also 
using a 128MB stick in it, and it worked fine.  I have tried 
disconnecting all SCSI devices, I have tried CUDA reset, I have 
installed a new battery.

Interestingly, one Genesis has a sticker on the MB with the Daystar 
logo, the other has it printed on.  The one with the printed-on logo 
also has all the internal connectors labeled.

What else can I do?  If I can't get these to work, i guess they will be 
junked.  They both "worked", according to previous owners.

Thanks,
Kyle-
