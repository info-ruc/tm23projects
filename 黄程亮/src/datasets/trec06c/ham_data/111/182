Tried nothing at all - just to see if any video would happen.  Nothing. 
  Just chime

Tried external AppleCD 300e with terminator block.  same.

tried connecting the internal SCSI drive to the cable again, with a 
jumper on termination, with AppleCD plugged in/on.  Same.

Tried changing jumper to disable parity.  Same.

The RAM I have is four banks of four chips - two banks on each side.  
They're labeled 16x64 60/EDO 128MB/4K/2BANK.  All five are identical; 
I've tried the one verified in my Powermac 5400 too.  heck, i even 
tried the little 8MB stick from the PowerMac, same thing.

Any special order to put in the RAM?

This is the only RAM I have, by the way.

You said don't chuck them.  People have said this before, too.  Well, 
this is about the fourth time I've asked on this forum alone, and I 
haven't been able to get anything, and this is my SECOND daystar.  Last 
time, I was told by an individual that my problem seemed similar to one 
he experienced, and a new logic board fixed that.  I have a whole new 
machine, and I think its really doubtful that they BOTH have a bad 
logic board.

I'd love to get a machine working, but I'm about out of patience.

Thanks for your response.
Kyle-
