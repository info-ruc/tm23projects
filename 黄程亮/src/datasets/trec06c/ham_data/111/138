The AuseAccess wiki 
<http://leven.comp.utas.edu.au/AuseAccess/>http://leven.comp.utas.edu.au/AuseAccess/ 
has received a number of updates over the holiday break, which you might 
like to look at.

Five new Australasian universities have established repositories, all of 
whom have signed up with commercial service provider ProQuest.

A fair bit has happened with deposit policies; see the page. I've updated 
my graph to 1 January 2006, which shows how voluntary policies continue to 
be underperforming disasters; QUT continues to surge ahead and is probably 
heading for full-text of 60% of DEST-reportable 2005 content. There are 
also moves from grant agencies in the USA and the UK. My sources say there 
may be movements in other countries surfacing soon.

Please feel free to edit any page that you can contribute to; it's your 
wiki. See you in Sydney in February, perhaps.

Arthur
