   Well, it has to be interrupt driven as that's the only code that will 
update the analog axes display which what you're seeing.  But the only way 
that the button names could be missing on the screen is for the device to 
have no digital buttons or it is enumerating them in a fashion that TimeDX 
can't handle -- either of which would be the first time we've come across 
such a device.

   Doesn't really matter, if there are no digital buttons DMDX isn't going 
to be using it.
