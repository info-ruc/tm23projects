Abstract
Most chemical engineers are (indirectly) trained to be "feedforward
thinkers" and they immediately think of "model inversion'' when it comes
doing control. Thus, they prefer to rely on models instead of data, although
simple feedback solutions in many cases are much simpler and certainly more
robust. 

The seminar starts with a simple comparison of feedback and feedforward
control and their sensitivity to uncertainty. Then two nice applications of
feedback are considered: 

1. Implementation of optimal operation by "self-optimizing control". The
idea is to turn optimization into a setpoint control problem, and the trick
is to find the right variable to control. Applications include process
control, pizza baking, marathon running, biology and the central bank of a
country. 

2. Stabilization of desired operating regimes. Here feedback control can
lead to completely new and simple solutions. One example would be
stabilization of laminar flow at conditions where we normally have turbulent
flow. I the seminar a nice application to anti-slug control in multiphase
pipeline flow is discussed. 

Biographical Sketch
Sigurd Skogestad was born in Norway in 1955. He received the Siv.Ing. degree
(Diploma Engineer) in chemical engineering from the Norwegian University of
Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim in 1978. After finishing his
military service at the Norwegian Defence Research Institute, he worked from
1980 to 1983 with Norsk Hydro in the areas of process design and simulation
at their Reseach Center in Porsgrunn, Norway. He then spent 3.5 years in the
US working towards his Ph.D. under the guidance of Manfred Morari, receiving
the Ph.D. degree from the California Institute of Technology in 1987. He has
been a professor of chemical engineering at the Norwegian University of
Science and Technology (NTNU) since 1987, and since 1999 he is Head of
Department of Chemical Engineering ( Kjemisk prosessteknologi ). He was at
sabattical leave at the University of California at Berkeley in 1994-95, and
at the University of California at Santa Barbara in 2001-02. 

He has a group of about 10 Ph.D. students and is the Head of PROST which is
the strong point center in process systems engineering in Trondheim and
involves about 50 people in various departments. 

The goal of his research is to develop simple yet rigorous methods to solve
problems of engineering significance. Research interests include the use of
feedback as a tool to (1) reduce uncertainty (including robust control), (2)
change the system dynamics (including stabilization), and (3) generallly
make the system more well-behaved (including self-optimizing control). Other
interests include limitations on performance in linear systems, control
structure design and plantwide control, interactions between process design
and control, and distillation column design, control and dynamics. 

The author of more than 100 journal publications and 150 conference
publications, he is the principal author together with Ian Postlethwaite of
the book "Multivariable feedback control" published by Wiley in 1996 (first
edition) and 2005 (second edition). In October 2000 he published a book on
"Process engineering - mass and energy balances" and a second edition came
in August 2003 (In Norwegian; , Prosessteknikk (Tapir, 2000/2003) (he is
considering writing an English edition.) 

Dr. Skogestad was awarded "Innstilling to the King" for his Siv.Ing. degree
in 1979, a Fullbright fellowship in 1983, received the Ted Peterson Award
from AIChE in 1989, the George S. Axelby Outstanding Paper Award from IEEE
in 1990, and the O. Hugo Schuck Best Paper Award from the American Automatic
Control Council in 1992. He was an Editor of Automatica during the period
1996-2002. 

In the autumn he teaches a course on introduction to process engineering
based on his own text book. He used to teach the process control course for
the 4th year students, but more recently this has been taken over by
professor Heinz Preisig. Since 1989 he taught a Ph.D. course in robust
multivariable control in the Control Department, based on his book with Ian
Postlethwaite, but the course was given for the last time in spring 1999,
and it has been replaced by an advanved undergraduate course given by
Professor Morten Hovd. The engineering degree at NTNU has recently (first
5-year students graduated in 2002) changed from a 4.5 year program to a 5
year program and the siv.ing. degree is now considered equivalent to a M.Sc.
degree. Professor Skogestad presentlty teaches a new advanced process
control module for the 5th year students.
