Thanks, again.

I'm using the correct Test button (top of dialog, next to Cancel and
Help buttons).

When I click it the coordinates appear below (or reset to (0, 0) ), but
nothing else.

Could it possibly be that it is an interrupt-driven device, though I get
the coordinates, instead of "device is interrupt driven"?

(I'm using the latest versions of DMDX/TimeDX and DirectX, by the way -
both of December 2005)

Thank you,

Joao
