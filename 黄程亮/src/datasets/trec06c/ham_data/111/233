Precedence: list

I get the list of buttons available (and axes), when I press test.
It's only the polling time that I don't get.
When I press the axes, instead of highlighting them on the list, the
coordinates change on top, just bellow the Test, Cancel and Help buttons.

So, if it is interrupt-driven and if the the buttons I'm using are
recognized, I guess I'll use this gamepad.

Anyway, thanks a lot for your help.

Joao
