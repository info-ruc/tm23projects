Dear member,



In the next few days you will receive a ballot paper asking you to vote on
whether to take industrial action in support of the 2006 pay claim. The
employers received our claim in early October 2005, and got a further
detailed presentation from AUT, NATFHE and EIS on 10 January.  Despite
having had more than three months to make a response, they said that while
"sympathetic" they had still not consulted with institutions about what
they might offer! 



In the face of this complacency, AUT and NATFHE both immediately agreed to
ballot for industrial action. EIS indicated that subject to their Executive
they were likely to follow suit.  Unfortunately it seems that only the
prospect of united action by all three academic unions will show the
employers that it is higher salaries we want rather than their "sympathy".



The unions presented data which showed that there is an estimated £3.4bn
(+25%) in additional income coming into the sector over the next three
years.  For years, the employers have said that they would like to pay you
more if only they had the money.  Now they do, and if you are serious about
wanting to improve your pay and conditions please use the ballot paper to
send the employers a clear message.



Your general secretary, national president and national executive all
recommend that you vote YES to take action, and this local association
joins them in also strongly urging you to vote YES in support of your union
and our campaign for better pay.  Every vote counts, so please fill in the
ballot paper as soon as your receive it. 



Please use your vote.
