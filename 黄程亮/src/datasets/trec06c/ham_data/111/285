I am running a cross modal experiment. The problem I am 
having is that the wav frame and the text frame overlap in 
spite of the null frame that comes between them. Below are 
data from my file:

<ep><azk><cr><s 72><fd 75><dfs 24><d 50><t 1500><id 
keyboard><id digitalVOX >
<id RecordVocal 0, 1500><oversize 2, 0, 5, 5><nfb><dbc 
0><dwc 255255255><vm 1024, 768, 768, 32, 60><eop>

Sample item:

+005135 <wav 2> “dictator” / <fd 25>/<fd 15> * 
“dictatorial”/;


In spite of the fact the the <fd> parameters are identical 
for each text item and for the null frame, the overlapping 
between the wav and text doesn't occur with the first few 
items presented. It actually develops later. In other 
words, it acts as if the blank <fd 25> frame gets shorter 
as time goes on until the wav and text frames actually 
overlap.

Any ideas you have are appreciated.

Thanks,

DE
