   If it's not interrupt driven it's polled, there are only two 
options.  TimeDX won't list the polling time till you actually test it.

   It means it's polled and isn't nearly as good as an interrupt driven one.


>If that is the case, can anyone recomend a gamepad that works?

   I would have said any USB device had to be interrupt driven but if 
TimeDX says it isn't then it ain't.  Depends how long it takes to poll the 
device, if it takes a small fraction of a millisecond to poll you can poll 
it every millisecond and it'll make a fairly good input device.
