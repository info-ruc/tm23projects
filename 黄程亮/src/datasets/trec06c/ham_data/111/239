   That's because it's an interrupt driven device.  As soon as it sees axes 
data however it overwrites the interrupt driven message with the axes 
data.  Guess when I wrote the code whatever device I had didn't immediately 
provide the data or I didn't care if the message was overwritten immediately.

   Yeah, it's supposed to.

   Yep.  You had me scared for minute there that there some new thing out 
there but no, everything's under control.
