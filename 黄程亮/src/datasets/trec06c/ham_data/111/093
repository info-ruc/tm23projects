Dear All,



Happy New Year. A short but important email this week.



In this weeks briefing for members, a reminder about the crucial meeting
with the employers on the 10th, the timetable for the conduct of a ballot
on industrial action and action short of a strike, should the employers
fail to make us an acceptable offer and a reminder about organising General
Meetings.



To build turnout and a yes vote, it is imperative that members have the
chance to discuss the issues. General Meetings on the pay campaign,
addressed by national representatives have now taken place in most local
associations. Many more LA's are organising meetings in the next few weeks.
If you are planning a general meeting, or even planning your second, and
would like a national speaker please contact: Justine.stephens@aut.org.uk



On Wednesday morning next week (January 11) we will be emailing you a
template for a local press release with space for local comment if talks
break down on Tuesday.  We will also be emailing you an update on
negotiations.



It is extremely important that the message below gets to as many members as
possible -- please forward to every member of your LA.

Dear Colleagues,



IMPORTANT MESSAGE



10th January: Last Chance for the Employers



It is crunch time for the employers. On Tuesday 10th January, AUT and
NATFHE will be meeting with UCEA (the employers' body) in a last ditch
attempt to find a negotiated settlement to this dispute. At this meeting
the employers have their last chance to prevent a year disrupted by action
across the entire Higher Education sector. If no acceptable offer is
forthcoming on 10th January, both AUT and NATFHE will begin to ballot their
members on industrial action and action short of a strike.



The very fact that this meeting is happening at all is a tribute to the
pressure that AUT and NATFHE members have mounted on the employers. This
pressure has been created by members' holding meetings across the country,
by members writing to their Vice Chancellors asking where they intend to
spend their additional income and by members writing to their MPs, asking
for their support for our campaign. The growing consciousness that members
are angry and have had enough of evasions and excuses, coupled with the
growing political support for our campaign among MPs and peers in
Parliament has made this meeting happen.



However, the meeting on Tuesday represents the final opportunity for the
employers to honour their previous commitment to spend 'at least a third'
of additional income from top-up fees and other grants on improving staff
pay. Should they once more fail to do so, both unions will begin to ballot
their members.



Balloting for action - Building for a Yes vote:



Should the employers fail to make an acceptable offer, AUT will send out
ballot papers to members on 13th January. AUT and NATFHE will be asking
members to vote YES strike action, and to vote YES to action short of a
strike, including a boycott of student assessment.



It is essential to get a high turnout and a big yes vote in this ballot.  A
high turnout and an endorsement of action would send the clearest possible
message to the employers and ironically represents the best possible
opportunity of resolving the dispute without having to take action. If the
union has to ballot members PLEASE make sure you use your vote.  A survey
conducted by the Employment Relations Research Centre at the University of
Copenhagen, showed that 30% of people who do not vote in ballots fail to do
so because they forget. Don't forget to use your vote and remind your
colleagues! Ballot papers are due to be dispatched on 13 January failing an
offer which is acceptable to your union.



Make sure the campaign is visible on your campus:

It sounds simple and it is: the more AUT posters on display around your
university- the more high profile the campaign will be. The visibility of
the strength of members feeling is absolutely essential if VC's are to take
notice. Should no acceptable offer be made on January 10, new vote YES
materials will be arriving at your university -- make sure you put a poster
on your door and distribute the fliers to colleagues, reminding them to
vote.



Build an alliance with students:

Student support and understanding will be vital in the coming weeks. New
resources for this are being prepared, but LAs and members are reminded to
approach Students and your local Students' Union to explain the campaign to
them. Specifically, LAs can ask Students' Unions to sign the NUS statement
of support (adapt to reflect any local situation if necessary) and then
send it to your VC. By this means, the academic unions can deprive VCs of a
way of dividing staff and students. The statement of support is available
here: http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/m/k/pay_jointstatement_final.pdf



All the best.
