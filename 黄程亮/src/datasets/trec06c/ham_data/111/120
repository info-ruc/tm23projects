<Please excuse the cross-posting of this message>

This message is directed at those involved with implementing or  
managing an institutional repository.

As we all know, recruiting content is probably THE biggest challenge  
for IRs. To assist others in populating their IRs, I am conducting an  
informal survey of organizational strategies for populating IRs.
Of course, I will be conducting a review of the literature, but I am  
also interested in hearing from those who have not made this  
information publicly available.

In particular, I would like to know the following:

I. A description of the strategy used to populate the IR
II. The approximate cost of this strategy
III. The success of the strategy in terms of increased content

Any and all input would be greatly appreciated.

Please reply to me off list (mkshearer@videotron.ca), and I will be  
happy to provide a summary of these results to the list when compiled.

Kathleen
