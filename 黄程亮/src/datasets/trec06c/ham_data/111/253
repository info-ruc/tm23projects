Hi everyone,

You're getting this email because you're registered for my fine-grained 
parallelism seminar this semester, or have told me that you probably will 
register.

The syllabus and basic info for the class online are now online at the
class web site:
http://www-csl.csres.utexas.edu/~billmark/teach/cs395t-06-spring/

The readings for the first two weeks of class are also listed.  Readings
for the rest of the semester will come later, after I make it past the
Jan 25th SIGGRAPH submission deadline that is keeping me fully occupied
right now.

Since the class only meets once a week, we're going to do the 
administrivia and background during the first half of this Thursday's
class, and start the actual learning during the second half.  Thus,
there is an assigned reading for the first day of class.

The reading for Thursday -- a paper on the Niagra architecture -- is
now posted on the class web site.  Please try to read the paper before
Thursday's class, and think about the following questions:

How is a single-chip multi processor like Niagara different from 
traditional multi-chip parallel computers?

What kind of tasks does the Niagra chip seem to be designed for?  To
what extent do you think it will provide good performance and
cost effectiveness for other kinds of workloads?

Bill
