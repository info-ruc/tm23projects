Dear Dr. Protopapas,

I would like to get a copy of your Python program and 
instructions/description because I am going to run a series of naming 
experiments with bilingual participants.
I hope you can provide me with detailed instructions because I have not 
idea what a Python program is.

Sincerely,
Irina Sekerina, Ph.D.
