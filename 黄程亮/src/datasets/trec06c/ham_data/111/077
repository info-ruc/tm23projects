Comments to the Author

I enjoyed reading the ODRPACK95: A Weighted Orthogonal Distance Regression =
Code with Bound Constraints. The manuscript and code are certainly appropri=
ate for ACM TOMS and the paper is a nice updating and natural generalizatio=
n of ODRPACK.

I think the paper would benefit from a quick review of applications of ODRP=
ACK; indeed the authors reference an application in biology in their refere=
nces. A few paragraphs describing and citing some examples of `ODRPACK in a=
ction' would, I think make the paper more accessible to a less mathematical=
-software audience. There are certainly many and varied applications that c=
an be used.

Secondly I thought the paper failed to explain sufficiently how the bounds =
were handled. I understand that the ODRPACK step was projected into a bound=
 constrained box, but I would have felt more comfortable knowing exactly wh=
ich projection was used (inspite of the reference to LANCELOT) and a precis=
e formulation of that projection. Also related to this, the current impleme=
ntation of the code calculates finite differences and up- or down-winds so =
that all function evalautions remain feasible, even when iterations are on =
or close to a constraint boundary. I think that the paper would benefit fro=
m a clearer explaination of why this is a good idea and how it affects the =
accuracy of the gradient calculation. For example, if one is fitting parame=
ters from a differential equationa and using the finite difference feature =
in the code, this lack of consistency in how gradients are calculated could=
 make a significant difference in optimization. I don't disagree that what =
has been implemented makes good sense. Clearly in most instances, it will m=
ake very little difference and will restrict all function evaluations to be=
 made inside the box. I think the paper would benefit from a clearer descri=
ption of why it was done and how it could change optimization.

There were a few corrections/suggestions specific to the text below:

Page 2:=20

"then (1.1) holds exactly" should read "then (1.1) holds".

"true value of $\Beta$ can only be" should read "true value of $\Beta$ can =
likely only be"

Page 3:

"the data to be complex" should read "complex data"

Page 4:

"This property obtains because" should read "This property holds because"

"diagonal matrix of constants" should read "constant diagonal matrix"

"In the weighted" should read "In the non-constant weighted"

Page 5:

"is just the Jacobian" should read "is the Jacobian"

"defined here to make the following equation simpler" should read "defined =
here to simplyfy the following equation"

Page 6:

"to stall near" should read "to stall near a boundary but far from optimali=
ty..."

"exploitation" should read "effective use"

"where $\Beta$ is physically constrained" should read "where $\Beta$ is con=
strained"

Page 7

"affect" should read "effect"

Page 8

"if the user did not" should read "if the user does not"

Page 11

"is greatly simplified" should read "simplified"

period missing from the third sentence in section six.

Finally - I think a reference to a modern survey on Trust Region Methods
(e.g. the book ``Trust-Region Methods''  by Conn et. al.) would make the pa=
per
more useful as a reference to non-mathematicians as would a reference
in addition to the Fuller text for statistics oriented readers (perhaps the=
 book
``Statistical Regression with Measurement Error'' by Cheng and Van Ness).
