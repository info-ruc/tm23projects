Hi Folks;

I quickly made up an example of a slide show that would work for the Four S=
lide example. It has a title slide, an explanation slide, a progressively d=
isclosed list of take away points and a comparison slide. Actually it has f=
ive slides=97I thought that last picture was so cute I just had to include =
it. You can find it in the Resources section of Blackboard. This show uses =
Comic Sans=97another very nice sans serif font that works on both macs and =
pcs.

Please remember the following:
1) Print out the assignment to better see all the details you'll be graded =
on,
2) We don't have class Monday,=20
3) I'll teach you to do the progressive list on Wednesday,=20
4)Submit your presentation before class on Wednesday,

OK? Email me if you have questions or problems.

Enjoy, Carolyn
