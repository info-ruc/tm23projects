Dear Athanassios
It sounds like it would be an excellent resource for DMDX users.  Hope it 
succeeds.

> Dear DMDX users,
>
> If you run any sort of naming experiments, in which you collect vocal
> responses using RecordVocal from DMDX, you have faced the problem of
> listening to all the responses in order to determine which ones are
> correct.  You may also have wanted to check the response times given by
> the voice key (VOX), in cases of mis-triggering, late triggering etc.
> This is cumbersome and time-consuming to do with generic audio
> applications.
>
> I have written a short program in Python which will play out the
> recorded responses and display the waveforms along with the timing
> marks and corresponding correct responses, so you can move on to the
> next trial with only one click (if the RT is correct) or two (if not).
> This program makes it extremely rapid to go through a large set of
> subject data. It is designed to be failsafe and can resume if
> interrupted for any reason. It produces an RT file, one row per
> subject, that can be directly read into a spreadsheet or statistical
> program for analysis.
>
> I have already successfully used the program for a couple of
> experiments. If you think it might be useful to you and are willing to
> provide detailed feedback, especially in case of problems, I would be
> happy to mail the code and instructions to you (the only reason I am
> not attaching it to this message is because attachments to the list
> are not allowed).  Once a sufficient set of testers has determined
> that the program is bug-free and useful I would be happy to see it
> uploaded somewhere publicly available for any DMDX user to download.
