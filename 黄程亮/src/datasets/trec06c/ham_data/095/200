   ANALYZE 2.03 fixes an error where if there were no data points in a 
condition it didn't explicitly set the avg, sum, and sd to zero in the data 
rejection code.  If there were data points they were zeroed prior to 
summing and so forth but because the code has to avoid the divide by zero 
that would result with no data points it just skipped that whole block of 
code.  At the start of a subjects calculations this would leave zero in the 
variables otherwise the average and sd will have come from the prior 
condition.  Not sure where the value 2 came from in the recent post but 
it's gone now that the data rejection code is making the right decisions 
when there are no data points.
