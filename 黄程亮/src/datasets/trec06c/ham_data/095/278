Arnold (et al),

Nonetheless, the technique DOES allow you to treat the integers
as continuous variables without losing optima.  
Second, some global optimization programs are touted as
being able to efficiently ignore large numbers of local optima.
Third, it is presently unclear to me what you mean about
"generates a local extremum at each critical point."  What is
your objective?  Are you using a penalty method?

Please understand that I am not saying that the technique is a 
panacea for all validated mixed integer programming problems;
I just would like some additional clarification of your statements.

Best regards,

Baker
