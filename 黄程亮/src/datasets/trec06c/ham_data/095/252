   And it also needs the .RTF item file.  The file you made that DMDX 
runs.  So it can tell what is a correct response for any given item.  As 
well as the .AZK.  Like both of them.  And the .AZK isn't converted into an 
.RTF, it's just plain text like DMDX produces.

There's an old proverb that says just about whatever you want it to.
