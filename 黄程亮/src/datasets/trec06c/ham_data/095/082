The key is, knowing when to get on and when to get off a stock, for  
successful day trading. CWTD has distinct patterns to watch for. 
 
Yesterday CWTD volume spiked again 53%. Today we got word that there  
will be more exciting news early next week. We are still hovering at  
$1.98, up 48 cents since this climb began. 
 
Take advantage of the current price on Monday, we expect to see it begin  
climbing Monday and Tuesday in anticipation of the coming news that stirred  
the market last week. 
 
This ride is not over. Jump on now and ride the price up on the  
highest return "Day Trade" we have featured this year. 
 
Get on CWTD first thing Monday morning.
