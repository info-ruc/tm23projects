   Oracle's Collaboration Suite and E-Business Suite 11i contain some of
   the vulnerable components and are also affected.

   According to Oracle, the following product releases and versions, and
   all future releases and versions are not affected:

     * Oracle Database 10g Release 1, version 10.1.0.3
     * Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 10g, version 10.1.0.3 (not

     * Oracle Application Server 10g (9.0.4), version 9.0.4.2 (not yet
       available)

Overview

   Several vulnerabilities exist in the Oracle Database Server,
   Application Server, and Enterprise Manager software. The most serious
   vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
   code on an affected system. Oracle's Collaboration Suite and
   E-Business Suite 11i contain the vulnerable software and are affected
   as well.

I. Description

   Several vulnerabilities have been reported in Oracle's Database
   Server, Application Server, and Enterprise Manager software. According
   to reports, several buffer overflow, format string, SQL injection and
   other types of vulnerabilities were discovered and reported to Oracle.

   Oracle has released Oracle Security Alert #68 (pdf) to address these
   vulnerabilities. We are tracking them as follows:

     VU#170830 - Oracle Enterprise Manager contains several
     vulnerabilities

     VU#316206 - Oracle Database Server contains several vulnerabilities

     VU#435974 - Oracle Application Server contains several
     vulnerabilities

   As more information becomes available, we will update these
   vulnerability notes as appropriate.

II. Impact

   The impacts of the vulnerabilities described above are unclear.

   According to credible reports, the impacts of these vulnerabilities
   range from the remote unauthenticated execution arbitrary code to data
   corruption or leakage.

III. Solution

Apply a patch or upgrade

   Apply the appropriate patch or upgrade as specified in the Oracle
   Security Alert #68 (pdf).

   Organizations that use Oracle's Collaboration Suite or E-Business
   Suite 11i should see Oracle Security Alert #68 (pdf) for remediation
   instructions.
