Hi Jonathan,

   Again, thank you for your quick reply.  I selected 640 X 480 (256color) in
'select video mode' in TimeDX and do the test.  Then, I do test in 'time video
mode'.  When I run the item file, the following error message appears: "Could
not find registry key <SOFTWARE\TimeDX\3\1\1 ATL MOBILITY RADEON 7500\640X 480
(480)_8bpp_0Hz>"  What should I do then?

best,
