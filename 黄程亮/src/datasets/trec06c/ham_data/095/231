IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) 
Sheraton Vancouver Wall Centre Hotel,
Vancouver, BC, Canada, 
May 21-26, 2006
http://www.wcci2006.org

On behalf of the Operating Committee, I would
like to welcome you to the venue of the 2006 World
Congress on Computational Intelligence, Sheraton
Vancouver Wall Centre in Vancouver, British Columbia,
Canada. Inherited from its successful history in
1994-Orlando, 1998-Anchorage and 2002-Honolulu, WCCI
2006 is the largest technical forum in the
Computational Intelligence community. Sponsored by the
IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (formerly the
IEEE Neural Networks Society), WCCI 2006 will provide
a venue to foster technical exchanges, renew
everlasting friendship, and establish new connections.
The Congress will bring together researchers and
practitioners in the area of theory, design,
implementation, and applications of computational
intelligence. The Congress will feature world renown
plenary and invited speeches, state-of-the-art invited
sessions, themed tutorial workshops, moderated panel
discussions, regular technical sessions, poster
interactions, and last but not least, exciting social
functions that include welcoming reception, award
banquet, student reception, and farewell reception.

Host of the 2010 Winter Olympics, Vancouver is
one of the most exciting meeting destinations around
the world. Some people come to Vancouver to enjoy the
wide-open spaces, sandy beaches, majestic rainforest,
and rugged West Coast mountains. Others come to
explore the mountain biking, first-class skiing,
windsurfing, scuba diving and inline skating, all
within driving distances. A rich ethnic mix of
cultures has provided Vancouver with incredible
world-class cuisine, shopping, and entertainment
experience.

Mark your calendar and plan for a lifetime
experience in WCCI 2006!
