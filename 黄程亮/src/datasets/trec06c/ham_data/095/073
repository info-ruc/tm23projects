   In our latest attempt to deal with the vile pool of evilness that is the 
Keithley driver software DMDX 3.0.4.4 shifts the focus back to the menu 
window after it kills the Keithley crap off as the Keithley crap would 
appear to be shifting the focus for no good reason other than to be 
evil.  Assuming of course that what I'm able to get here is replicating the 
same problem that PCMCIA Keithley card users are having where after a 
syntax check a nice big white screen would be displayed.  You could ALT-TAB 
to the right DMDX window but almost no one but me would know it of 
course.  So now DMDX does it for you.
