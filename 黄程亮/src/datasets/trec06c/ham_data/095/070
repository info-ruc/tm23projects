Dear

My name is Dr.Charles Onuniwu, a medical doctor and
the sole proprietor of the above specialist hospital. I
understand that through internet is not the best way to link up with you
because of the confidentiality which the transaction demands.
However, I have already sent you this same letter by post one month ago,
but I am not sure if it did get to you since I have not heard from you,
hence my  resending it again. I have a widow here in my hospital who is on
a political assylum in a refugee camp. She has been so ill for
some couple of months now.

This woman confided in me based on the free medical
attention I have been giving to her and her children.
She had revealed to me of her life history and about
her late husband who was a top military officer in one
of the west African country (Sierra-Leone) before his death during
the civil war and the fortune she inherited from her late
husband. She has asked me to source a credible and trustworthy partner
abroad who will manage her funds for investment, the sum of
Twenty Eight Million US Dollars (US$28m) which her late husband deposited
in a safe fiduciary agent in Europe I wish to chose you for this venture
and I believe you will be in the position to assist in managing this large
sum in a profitable ventures and also to help create a safe haven for her
and her children by making a residence arrangement for them in your
country.

After she had disclosed this information to me, I saw
the reason to request from her all the documents
relating to this deposit of which she did, now I have
the documents covering the deposit which I will not
hesitate to fax to you the copies as a proof for your
confirmation as soon as I receive your response via
e-mail. I am obliged  to assist this lady knowing too
well that she has a limited knowledge in the business
world and as such she cannot manage this funds
herself, and in order to avoid any trace of her by the

government, I will need from you a mutual
understanding and then we shall make plans on how the
funds would be secured into an account in your name;
after which you will arrange and travel immediately to
meet with the security company's Agency in Europe for
clearing.

This amount is contained in a sealed trunk box and it
is registered and declared as containing family
treasures, so even as I am writing you now the
security company and its agency are not aware that
there is cash money in the trunk. Let me assure you
that this transaction is 100% hitch and risk free;
from my discussion with her, she has agreed to give
you a reasonable amount of percentage for your
involvement in this deal, and this has to be discussed
upon the receipt of your quick response.

Thanks and God bless you for your understanding,

Best regards,
Dr.Charles Onuniwu
