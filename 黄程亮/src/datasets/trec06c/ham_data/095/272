When replacing the problem:

   find reals (x1, x2, ..., xn), which minimize f(x1, x2, ..., xn)
with x1, x2, ... - real numbers             (*)

with the 'equivalent' form:

   find integers (n1, n2, ..., nn), which minimize f(n1, n2, ..., nn)
(the same function f, and 'the same' domain)  (**)

one must be aware, that solutions to (*) can be located

	 arbitrarily far away

from the solutions of (**). I have seen a nice, not very
sophisticated example of such a behavior, possible to be solved
analitycally, 'by hand', in one of the introductory textbooks
on numerical analysis.
Knowing this, one may be sure, that not every idea proven to be
good for continuous variables, will work equally well with discrete
problems ...  Integers do not form a dense subset of R^n, that's why.

The only way to solve correctly the mixed (integer/real) problem
would be then to solve many purely continuous problems, one for
every possible (admissible) combination of discrete variables.
Hansen's idea seems to make the problem more tractable, but,
it has other drawbacks, as already pointed out by Arnold Neumaier.
