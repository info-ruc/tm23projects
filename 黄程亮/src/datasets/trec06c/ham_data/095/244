Hi,

I'm having trouble getting the analyze program to run. I get an error message
that says: not an RTF file, first chars are not "{\rtf". I've followed the
directions on Matt Davis's site to convert .azk files to .txt files. But
analyze apparently wants .rtf files. I've even tried to simply save the
converted .txt file as .rtf, but I still get the same error message.

Any ideas?


Thanks,

Carrie
