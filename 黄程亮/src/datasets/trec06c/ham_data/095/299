Dear all,
=20
just to answer to the message from Martin Berz : I do not have a test =
problem as yet.  I actually wrote to the list since I am at a =
preliminary stage (thinking of a project and surveying interesting =
methods) and aware of part of the literature on interval methods but =
also looking for further relevant references.  I had read the section on =
integers in Hansen's book but I was wondering whether there were further =
publications and, also, published work on practical experiences.
=20
So I guess the way the discussion has developed, referring to (mixed) =
integer programming in general, is the kind of response I was hoping to =
read (and, by the way, many thanks to all those who posted =
contributions).
=20
Andrea Rosa
