   More attempts to make the Keithley hardware work like one would expect 
it to work.  TimeDX has largely cosmetic changes to the Keithley driver 
dialog that I forgot to make before releasing the last version and DMDX has 
a new way of killing the Keithley crap off that's no longer relying on 
fortuitous circumstances -- at least that's the theory.  Can't really tell 
as the laptop I have to test the PCMCIA Keithley hardware with isn't 
capable of running DMDX, instead all it can run is the syntax check.  Which 
is where the errors were manifesting anyway so we can hope that a machine 
that has a video chipset that can at least flip video pages will work nicely.
