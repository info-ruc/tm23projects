Dr. Rosa,

Actually, what George suggests is a fairly widely-used technique in
global optimization, not confined to interval methods:  One replaces
a constrained minimization problem by another problem whose minimum
is less than or equal to the minimum of the original problem;  this
derived problem is called a "relaxation."  The solution to the
relaxation over a sub-region of the search region then provides a
lower bound over any global optimum constrained to that subregion.
Upper bounds to the global optimum are obtained by 
evaluating the objective at feasible points.  The subregion can
then be eliminated from further search if the lower bound is greater
than the upper bound on the optimum.

The above "branch and bound" technique, to my knowledge, is more-or-less
"standard" for solving mixed integer programming problems (i.e.
replacing the integers by continuous variables as George Corliss
indicated, etc.).  Interval methods in particular supply the 
following additional features:

1. Validation, that is mathematically certain bounds

2. Several alternate ways of obtaining bounds on ranges 

3. the "interval Newton" acceleration procedure.

A good starting point for further research might be Arnold Neumaier's
web page:

Sincerely,

R. Baker Kearfott
