Claudio et al,

I've tried that.  For some problems it seems to work OK.  However,
if you follow that route, you must have a very good way of handling
general equality constraints, in general.  You cannot get around
the inherent computational complexity of integer programming
that way.  It is one tool of many that can possibly be used.
