I've referred to Jonathon's and Matt's documentation regarding the timing of
constant ISI's.  Thanks for the info, we have definitely improved the timing of
our script.  It appears I've got the timing down so that the ISI's are within
approximately 3 tics--regardless of whether or not one responds.  The timing
becomes more consistent when I use words (instead of jpegs).  If anyone has any
suggestion for improving the timing w/ the jpegs (COTs should occur every 4500
msec), I'd appreciate it.

Below is my parameter line and some item lines:
<ep><RecordClockOnTime><id keyboard> <id mouse><cr><NoFeedback><FrameDuration
225><Delay 76><t 2900><FontMultipliers 3><NoFeedback> <vm 800,600,600,16,0><id
keyboard><id mouse> <NoFeedback></ep>
