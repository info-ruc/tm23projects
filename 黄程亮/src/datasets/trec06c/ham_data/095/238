            First call for participation

    6th CONFERENCE ON REAL NUMBERS AND COMPUTERS (RNC6)
		November 15-17, 2004
              Schloss Dagstuhl, Germany


Website:  http://cca-net.de/rnc6/


Dates:

Registration deadline: October     24, 2004
Conference:            November 15-17, 2004


Objective:

The aim  of the symposia on  "Real Numbers and Computers"  is to bring
together specialists  from various research areas,  all concerned with
problems  related  to  computations  based  on  real  numbers.   These
computations  may use  any  number system  implemented  by a  software
package or in hardware,  including floating and fixed point, serial,
on line, continued  fractions, exact, multiple precision, interval
and stochastic arithmetic.

Results  are  sought  on   both  applied  and  fundamental  questions.
Important topics  discussed during  these conferences include  but are
not limited to:

   * Foundation and properties of number systems
   * Computability and complexity
   * Formal aspects and automatic proof checking
   * Links with number theory and automata theory
   * Basic arithmetic operations
   * Implementation of the standard and special functions
   * Engineering of floating and fixed point algorithms
   * Symbolic manipulation of numbers
   * Accuracy and reliability for applications and industry
   * Robust geometric algorithms and exact geometric computation
   * Hardware design support and implementations

The conference  will feature  invited lectures and  contributed talks.


Invited Lectures:

1.  Benno Fuchssteiner, Paderborn, Germany

2.  Simon Plouffe, Montreal, Canada

3.  Stefan Schirra, Magdeburg, Germany


Contributed Talks:

1.  Generating formally certified bounds on values and round-off errors
     Marc Daumas & Guillaume Melquiond

2.  A proven correctly rounded logarithm in double-precision
     de Dinechin, Loirat, Muller

3.  On intermediate precision required for correctly-rounding
     decimal-to-binary floating-point conversion
     M. Hack

4.  An extension of Chaitin's halting probability $\Omega$ to measurement

     K. Tadaki

5.  Bridging the gap between formal specification and bit-level
     floating-point arithmetic
     S. Boldo

6.  A fast algorithm for Julia sets of hyperbolic rational functions
     Robert Rettinger

7.  On the hierarchy of $\Delta_02$-numbers
     Xizhong Zheng

8.  Automata, Borel functions and real numbers in Pisot basis
     Cagnard, Simonnet

9.  A comparison of real and complex pseudozero sets for polynomials with
     real coefficients
     Graillat, Langlois

10. Software division and square root using Goldschmidt's algorithm
     Peter Markstein

11. A comparison of polynomial evaluation schemes
     L. Fousse, S. Schmitt

12. The generic multiple-precision floating-point addition with exact
     rounding (as in the MPFR library)
     Vincent Lefevre

There will also be an informal session open to present work in progress.
Potential speakers might contact Christiane Frougny with an intended title
