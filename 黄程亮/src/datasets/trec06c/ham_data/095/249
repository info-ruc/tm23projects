Dear Dr. Rosa,

I cannot point you to references, but I can offer that one approach I
suppose is considered well known in the community is to apply interval
methods to the continuous problem.  When the interval of real numbers
contains only one integer, snap to that integer.  You sort of run a
continuous algorithm with a tolerance of 0.99.

Others may have more directly applicable references.
