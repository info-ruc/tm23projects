Hi everyone, is there a manner by which I can provide
correct or incorrect feedback to a participant once
they
type the target in?  I saw a response to a similar
question from D. Hanley a while back but I cannot find
this'atozilliontext' key word.  I suppose if there was
a way to compare the typed word to something then you
could branch it to the word 'correct'.? thanks for any
help you can provide
-Tom Eaton
