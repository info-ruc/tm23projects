Dear N. Christopher Phillips,
 
I am writing following the impressive information about your profile through the website your capability and reliability to champion this business opportunity.
 
In an introduction of myself, I am Justin.  From the northern part of TOGO LOME working with the above  bank,Married with three kids but lost their mother some few years back ,you may ask why this unexpected letter which is normal I will want to seek your assistance after my discovery during auditing in this bank,
 
 I as the head of Auditing department discovered an abandoned sum Fourteen millions U.S dollars ($14 md) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family in 31 October,1999 in a plane crash. 
 
Since we got this information about his death, we have been expecting his next of Kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless somebody applies for it as next of Kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking and financial policies but unfortunately we learnt that his supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him in the crash leaving no body behind to claim the money.   
 
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and decided as the head of this department to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed bills.Do not view this as been illegal but to help people like us that have no hope in  life instead of the bank converting this much money to the security funds of the bank because if you dont assist us the bank will lay hold on this money. 
 
Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the Bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased indicating your private, telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the money will be remitted.   
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% hitch free and that you should not nurse any atom of fear as all required  arrangements havebeen made for the smooth transfer of this funds and your acceptance is what will crown this effort. You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter and don't fail to detail me with your contact numbers to enable me call you and detail you more. We can conclude this operation within some few banking days based on the amount of coperation you will contribute.  
 
Please keep this very confidential for more information about this crash and person you can contact this website:

Call me on :+228 9481249 on the receipt of this mail.
I long to hear from you soon.
Remain bless,
 
Justin.
