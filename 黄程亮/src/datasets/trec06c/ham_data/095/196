I have successfully run the Unload utility to merge two azk data files into one. However, I have not been able to run the Analyze program.

With my merged azk data as the input file, Analyze produces an error message: not an RTF file, first chars are not "{\rtf". Although I have not seen any references in the Help or Tutorial files to needing to convert the azk file to rtf for Analyze, I have done so in response to the error message. When I then try to run the RTF file as input to Analyze, I no longer get the RTF error message, but I get this in the progress box:

Parsing item file ...

Item file has 0 non-instruction item numbers

After several hours of trying everything I can think of, any advice or suggestions would be gratefully received.
