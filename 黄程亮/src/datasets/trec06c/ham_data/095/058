   The permission here is being able to write to the directory \Program 
Files\DMDX and isn't a registry thing.  The current versions of DMDX 
shouldn't require any more registry permission modifications.  I didn't 
attempt to resolve the diagnostics file message as finding a writeable 
location isn't as easy as trying the alternative registry keys.  I guess I 
can try and create diagnostics.txt in My Documents if the default creation 
fails but even figuring out where My Documents is requires digging into 
windows functions I only dimly recall existing...

   And of course when I go hunting for them I find my development system 
doesn't even have any of the required files, grrr.  Otherwise we might've 
seen something to fix it this afternoon.
