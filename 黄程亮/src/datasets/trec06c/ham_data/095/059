   While doing so will certainly rectify things the reason is probably that 
new TimeDX keys need to get created that the less privileged users can 
manipulate.  This will either entail running TimeDX again as each of these 
less privigidges users and changing settings indicated that are indicated 
in the error messages or by removing DMDX and TimeDX completely and 
starting over.  Settings will need to be created for each user of DMDX.
