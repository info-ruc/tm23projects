    We are currently experiencing timing issues with our Dmdx scripts for a soon
to be fMRI, encoding-retrieval study (done with pictures). We want to make sure
that we have the COTs nailed before we take it to the scanner but after many
test trials and much discussion we still do not have an answer for why COT
inconsistencies exist between items when a response is made and when a response
is not made.
   The problem is the following --the COTs for items when responses are made and
COTs for items when responses are not made are not identical. Basically, when a
response is made the following item is displayed more quickly than for items
that follow items where responses are not made. Therefore the COTs for all
items that follow an item that has timed out are later than the COTs for items
that follow items that are responded to. This experiment is not designed to be
self paced and we assumed that the COTs would not change, as a function of
whether or not a response was made, due to specifications made within the
script and header line such as, fd,d,t and /. Since we have not been able to
figure it out we thought we would look to the list serve for some advice. Below
you will find the header line as well as the first few items of a script.
Immediately following are the COTs for items responded to and not responded to.
Thanks~
