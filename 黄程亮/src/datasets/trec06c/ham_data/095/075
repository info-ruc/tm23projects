   Frame delimiters don't take a tick, the blank frame between the last 
frame delimiter and the semicolon /; takes tick.  So it's only one extra 
tick and 338 would be my reading of your item's duration.

   Looks to me like your refresh rate isn't really 75Hz, it's more like 
80Hz.  It's possible when you change video cards or monitors for TimeDX 
settings to stay set at some frequency that's no longer being used, you 
need to time your video mode again.  If you're using XP you might give some 
thought to using video modes like 800,600,16,75 instead of 
800,600,16,0.  While not foolproof I've only seen a specific retrace rate 
be incorrect once.
