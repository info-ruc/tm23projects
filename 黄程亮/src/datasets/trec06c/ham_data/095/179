SAC'2005
For the past nineteen years, the ACM Symposium on
Applied 
Computing has been a primary gathering forum for
applied 
computer scientists, computer engineers, software
engineers, 
and application developers from around the world. 
SAC 2005 is sponsored by the ACM Special Interest 
Group on Applied Computing, and is hosted by New
Mexico 
Institute of Mining and Technology, Socorro, NM, USA.

RCA TRACK: MOTIVATIONS 
Many numerical computations, be it solutions to
systems of
differential equations or optimization problems coming
from applied
areas like protein folding, do not provide us with
guaranteed
computation results. In many situations, we have
numerical solutions,
we may even have a theorem guaranteeing that
eventually, this numerical
solution tends to the actual precise one, but the
algorithm itself
does not provide us with guaranteed bounds on the
difference between the
numerical approximate solution and the desired actual
one. 

Therefore, in some practical situations, numerical
solutions 
are much farther from the actual (unknown) precise
solutions than the users assume. As a result, we often
end up with
inefficient local maxima for practical optimization
problems like
chemical engineering - or even with a mission failure
if we are
planning, e.g., a spaceship trajectory. 

For some such algorithms, researchers have found
guaranteed bounds, but
producing a guaranteed bound for each algorithm
requires a lot of work. 

It is therefore desirable to develop a methodology
that would provide
algorithms with automatic result verification, i.e.,
with
automatically generated upper bound on the difference
between the
actual and the numerical solution. In other words, we
need computation 
techniques that produce reliable (guaranteed) results.


This problem was recognized already in the late 1950s
when Lockheed 
wanted to develop algorithmic techniques guaranteeing
trajectories of spaceflights. These techniques,
largely developed 
by Ramon E. Moore, were later applied to other 
practical problems where deviations from the target
are of critical
importance. The main idea behind these techniques is
that 
at any intermediate step of the computations, instead
of the exact
number, we keep an interval of possible values. For
inputs (that
usually come from measurements), we have an interval
because
measurements are never 100% accurate; if the
manufacturer of the
measuring instrument guarantees that the measurement
error is D or
smaller, then the measuring result X means that the
actual value is in
the interval [X-D,X+D]. At each elementary
computational step, we
apply interval arithmetic to the corresponding
intervals and produce
the interval for the result; e.g., [a,b]+[c,d] leads
to [a+c,b+d]. 

Of course, this "straightforward interval
computation", that does not
take dependence between intermediate results into
consideration, does
not always lead to efficient estimates; however, in
the last 40+
years, efficient interval computations methods have
been developed
based on this original idea. There are a lot of
interesting
applications of interval computations, there is a lot
of potential,
but there are still numerous open problems, situations
where new
techniques are needed. 

One such technique that has also been used to provide
guaranteed
bounds is the technique of constraint propagation.
This technique
originated in logical AI problems, and it has been
lately successfully
applied to numerical problems, often in conjunction
with interval
methods. For example, one of the latest textbooks on
interval
computations, by Jaulin et al., contains robot-related
practical
examples of combining these two techniques. This
combination has
started, it is the object of interest by many
researchers, it has
already led to interesting and efficient packages like
Numerica, but
there is still a lot of room for potential
improvement. 

We hope that our track, with an emphasis on such a
combination, 
will bring together not only algorithm developers but
also 
practitioners whose practical needs will help guide
researchers 
in the proper directions. 

PAPERS
Authors are invited to submit original papers in all
areas 
related to the track's topic. Possible submissions
fall into 
the following categories:

* Original and unpublished research work
* Report of innovative computing applications in the
arts, 
  sciences, engineering, and business areas 
* Report of successful technology transfer to new
problem domains
* Report of industrial experience and demos of new
innovative systems

Peer groups with expertise in the track focus area
will blindly 
review submissions to that track. Accepted papers will
be 
published in the annual conference proceedings. 

Papers should be submitted with no more that 4000
words. Accepted
papers must fit within five (5) two column pages, with
the option (at
additional expense) to add three (3) more pages.

For submission, please use guidelines posted under
Downloads at the 
SAC 2004 website. (There may be minor changes for
submitting the 
final versions of accepted papers). 

Paper submissions should be sent to Track co-Chairs. 

IMPORTANT DUE DATES

CONFERENCE VENUE
Nestled at 7000 feet (2 km) in the foothills of Rocky
Mountains, 
Santa Fe, New Mexico, the "City Different", is the
oldest capital city
in the United States, the city that has a long history
and rich
cultural heritage. Originally a townlet populated by
Pueblo Indians, 
it became a capital of Nueva Espana (New Spain) in
1607, then a 
capital of the Mexican state of Nuevo Mexico (New
Mexico); 
since 1840s, it is part of the USA. 

Santa Fe is famous for its culture, art, and
traditions. It is home to 
US's third largest art market, to the Santa Fe Opera,
variety of
cuisines, hundreds of quaint shops, and unlimited
outdoor
activities. For more information about Santa Fe see
the city website
