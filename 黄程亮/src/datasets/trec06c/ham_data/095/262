This is a simple way of posing the problem to a package that handles
only continuous problems. But it is quite inefficient since
it generates a local extremum at every feasible integer point,
and thus makes the problem unnecessarily difficult.

Even linear mixed integer problems, which can generally be solved
quite efficiently using branch and cut with an LP-solver, 
will become nonlinear!
