Dear list members,

I have recently become interested in interval methods as a means of =
solving non-linear non-convex optimisation problems and I am looking to =
employ them in my own fields of work (traffic and transport engineering =
and econometrics).

However, part of the problems I'd like to work on with intervals are =
actually integer programs and I do not have, so far, a clear grasp of =
how applicable are interval methods in this case.

Could you point me to papers, books sections or other resources =
discussing the applications of interval methods to the solution of =
(non-linear) integer programs?

Many thanks
