   It's atoizilliontext, AsciiTOInteger, which is an ancient C 
acronym.  And it's not in the regular documentation because it isn't a 
keyword, it's a token in an expression so you need to look at the 
<SetCounter> keyword.  That or use the search function in the help but then 
of course you'd have to have known the correct spelling ;)

   Yep, that's the idea.  Load a counter with it and then branch on the 
counter's value or use <BranchIf> and branch on an expression that compares 
atoizilliontext with a constant, no counters needed.

                                                /"\

There's an old proverb that says just about whatever you want it to.
