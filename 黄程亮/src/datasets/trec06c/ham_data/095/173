Thanks.  I got rid of that and added $ to the begining and end parts. 
My last hurdle, and I might just leave it, is that we do in fact want to
have correct versus non correct answers on top of keeping track of the
ratings.  Right now I have it so that the mpr and the mnr are positive
and negative based on the correct answer, which gives me an output file
that records the reaction time, the answer given, and would show a
timeout whenever the wrong answer is given, but there must be a more
elegant way to do it.

    You might want to whack the <bu 1001> too if you still have it in
item 
0.  If you start scrambling things a different number of items will be 
skipped on each run...
