I'm running DMDX on a Windows XP box, and have had no problems as long as I'm
using my desktop login.

Now I want DMDX to run under other logins, and have had a lot of problems
getting it up and running.  I think I finally solved the TimeDX problems I had,
but now that I try to open DMDX under the new login I get an "Cannot open
diagnostics file" error box, and then, when I try to run a script the
following:  "Could not dreate/open registry key/
<SOFTWARE\DMDX\3\LastUsedItemFile> Error Code 5.

Help, please.
