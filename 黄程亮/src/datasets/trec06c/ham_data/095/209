   Ok, hopefully the last iteration in the battle against that which cannot 
be shovelled going by the despicable name of Keithley.  DMDX 3.0.4.7 now 
traps a windows message it previously had nothing to do with detecting when 
the Keithley crap shifts our focus (which can be some completely arbitrary 
time after initializing their excretions) and shifting focus back where it 
should be.  All previous kludges are removed as their action is rendered moot.
