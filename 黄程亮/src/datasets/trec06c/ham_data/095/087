Howdy,

I assume `admin' is the user's name!?

I think you've got a to go a bit deeper (~ is you HOME directory,
/Users/admin/ if you're short login name is `admin'):

~/Library/texmf/tex/ for startes. If that doesn't work try one level =
deeper:

~/Library/texmf/tex/plain/ for TeX files and ~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/ =
for
LaTeX files.

Hope that helps.
Good Luck,

This is very easy to change when done from a script, but more
complicated when integrated like in your second suggestion.

But those files are all generated automatically, and I can't think of
any circumstance where you'd want to keep some and trash the rest.


<excerpt>3) A suggestion for the design of TeXShop: Make all the
"related" files accessible within TeXShop itself. I.e., now you can
access your "file.tex" and "file.pdf" from the bottom section of the
Window menu. If you are dealing with several files at the same time,
this becomes a bit cluttered, but nevertheless you can only access the
source and the pdf. I would thus suggest that each main file writes a
single entry in the Window menu, and that all the related files appear
in a submenu, to the left. And even more, I would also suggest a
different scheme of key equivalent for this, instead of the command-1
to jump back-and-forth between source and pdf. For instance, using the
control key plus an alphabetic modifier: ctrl + : s for source, p for
pdf, c for console, a for aux, b for bbl, l for log, i for ind, t for
toc... and user-customizable, too.

</excerpt>

As i just mentioned, in general none of these are edited by hand.
_Maybe_ you'd want to look inside the main (.log), index (.idl) or
bibtex (.bbl) log files - but this is only for finding some very
obscure errors, and probably not worth integrating into an editor.


Something I'd like to see in TeXShop would be keyboard shortcuts for
the Scripts menu ... maybe just Shift-Command-1..9 for the first 9
entries in the menu, or maybe for the entries in the first submenu,
and then you could arrange your most needed scripts there?

Subject: "Clean up" macro
From: "Will Robertson" <will@guerilla.net.au>
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 2004 12:32:09 +0930

Hi all

I've got a macro for you guys to test! If it's all good I'll add it to 
my others for download. Comments of any sort are welcome! (Note that an 
iTeXMac version is not planned immediately due to time constraints, but 
is not hard to adapt - any volunteers?)

Anyway, you can customise the extensions list at the top if you wish 
(I'm still accepting obscure extensions for the `final' version), and 
there's a boolean you can set called delete_files_only_with_same_name. 
Say you've got:
    main.tex
    main.aux
    chap1.tex
    chap1.aux
If you run the script with that flag as false (default), it will delete 
both .aux files. Otherwise, as true, it will delete only the one 
corresponding to the tex document you run the script on.

Hope it's useful!
Will



--Applescript

-- CUSTOMISE TO YOUR LIKING:
property extensions_to_delete : {"aux", "bbl", "blg", "brf", "glo", 
"idx", "ilg", "ind", "loa", "lof", "log", "lot", "mtc", "mlf", "out", 
"pdfsync", "toc"}

property delete_files_only_with_same_name : false
-- If your file is document.tex, setting this true will delete only 
document.aux, document.log, etc., but NOT otherdoc.aux, otherdoc.log, 
etc.
-- Otherwise, ALL files with the extensions_to_delete will be deleted.

-- THE SCRIPT:
tell application "TeXShop"

	set texpath to alias posix file #TEXPATH# -- gives "/path/to/docu.tex"

	tell application "Finder"
		set texfolder to the container of (texpath as alias)
		if delete_files_only_with_same_name then
			set texname to the name of (texpath as alias)
			set texname to do shell script "echo " & the quoted form of texname 
& " | cut -f 1 -d '.'"
			set texfiles to every file in texfolder whose name contains (texname 
& ".")
		else
			set texfiles to every file in texfolder
		end if
	end tell
	
	set files_to_delete to {}
	set filenames_to_delete to {}
	
	repeat with this_file in texfiles
		if (the name extension of this_file is in extensions_to_delete) then
			set the end of files_to_delete to (this_file)
			set the end of filenames_to_delete to "    " & (the name of 
this_file as string) & return
		end if
	end repeat
	
	display dialog "Are you sure you want to move the following files to 
the trash?" & return & filenames_to_delete as string buttons {"Keep", 
"Trash"} default button "Trash" with icon caution
	
	if the button returned of the result is "Trash" then
		tell application "Finder" to move every item of files_to_delete to 
the trash
	end if
	
end tell

Thanks for all of them!
And thanks Constantinos, for your three.

Actually I wasn't, but I'll add it as an option - my reasoning being 
that when I have a bunch of \include files, they get .aux files and 
things too.

Here the problem is not with TeXShop, but with tex (the command line =20
program, which is the engine used by TeXShop behind the scene). tex, =20
being of Unix origin (to simplify), does not understand Mac OS aliases; =20=

it does understand, however, Unix symlinks (contraction of symbolic =20
links), created with the command "ln -s" in Terminal. To learn more =20
about this command, you can type "man ln" (without the quotes) in =20
Terminal. The Finder in Mac OS X understands both traditional Mac OS =20
aliases, and Unix symlinks, and displays them in the same way.

I've used symlinks in conjunction with TeXShop in the past, and that =20
works. For example, one of the folders on my hard drive has a similar =20=

structure (edited for brevity) as the one you're looking for:

ls -alR
total 88
drwxrwxrwx  59 brunovoi  staff  2006 13 Feb  2003 Dessins
drwxrwxrwx  54 brunovoi  staff  1836 16 Feb  2003 EPSF

-rwxrwxrwx   1 brunovoi  staff  4861 28 Dec  1998 macros.tex

where the subfolder Figures contains:

./Figures:
total 9520
-rwxrwxrwx   1 brunovoi  staff   48729 30 Dec  1998 finfield.eps
-rwxrwxrwx   1 brunovoi  staff   65749  8 Jan  1999 geomfour.eps
-rwxrwxrwx   1 brunovoi  staff   86314 26 Aug  1998 geomreal.eps
[...]

and the folder Version 2.0.1 (where a .tex file to be typeset resides) =20=

contains:

./Version 2.0.1:
total 1360
lrwxr-xr-x   1 brunovoi  staff      10 14 May  2003 Figures -> =20
../Figures
lrwxr-xr-x   1 brunovoi  staff      13 14 May  2003 macros.tex -> =20
../macros.tex
-rwxrwxrwx   1 brunovoi  staff  131137  9 Mar  1999 pap3v2.tex
-rwxrwxrwx   1 brunovoi  staff    1408  9 Mar  1999 paren.tex
-rwxrwxrwx   1 brunovoi  staff  129472 11 Mar  1999 ppt3v2.tex

The first letter "l" here at the beginning of a line indicates a =20
symlink, and "Figures -> ../Figures" indicates the exact nature of this =20=

link (namely, the folder "Figures" in the parent directory).

I've never got the syntax of ln to work exactly as I wanted it to, for =20=

example specifying the name of the symlink to be different from the =20
link of the original file (or directory). To get the above structure I =20=

had to use trial-an-error, though I don't remember exactly what I did. =20=

In any case, for example:

- "ln -s AAA/BBB" creates, in the current directory, a symlink named =20
"BBB" to the subdirectory "BBB" of the subdirectory "AAA" of the =20
current directory.

- "ln -s ../CCC/DDD" creates, in current directory, a symlink named =20
"DDD" to the subdirectory "DDD" of the subdirectory "CCC" of the parent =20=

directory.

Maybe some Unix-knowledgeable people on this list would have more =20
helpful indications on the precise syntax of ln? A lengthy discussion =20=

of symlinks with respect to TeX, entitled "[OS X TeX] Aliases, symlinks =20=

and hard links", also took place on this list starting 12 February 2003 =20=

<http://www.esm.psu.edu/mac-tex/MacOSX-TeX-Digests/2003/MacOSX-=20
TeX_Digest_02-12-03.html>.

Hope this helps,

I go one as a gift two years ago. My wife got them to ship to the US 
and all. Having my own TeX lion is very cool. Good quality, although 
not necessarily good for a toddler (who would likely rip some parts of 
it off pretty easily). It's designed more for adults for display.

But, in the pdf you continue to see

=95 word
=95
=95

Of course, there is no hassle as, if you delete instead of undoing,=20
everything works as it should.

Hi,

does anybody know if Aleph is available for MacOS(X)?
There is no i-package, but maybe another way?

Thank you,

Subject: Pixelated sans serif fonts (in TeXShop)
From: "Michael S. Hanson" <mshanson@wesleyan.edu>
Date: Tue, 17 Aug 2004 15:23:12 -0400

	I am using \textsf{} to render some text in sans serif in a LaTeX  
document, and discovered that this font appears as a bitmapped or badly  
"pixelated" font in the PDF document as viewed by TeXShop on my  
desktop.  Oddly, I didn't have this font problem when I compiled the  
same LaTeX document on my PowerBook last night.  I thought both  
machines had the same gwTeX installation, but perhaps not.   
(Unfortunately, I do not have the PB in my office today to confirm.)

	In any case, does anyone have suggestions for fixing this problem on  
my desktop?  I have attached what I think (hope?) might be the relevant  
output to the TeXShop console, but I frankly don't understand the  
TeXnical side of LaTeX to make heads or tails of it.  Thanks in advance  
for any assistance;  apologies for the length.

Howdy,

The last item in my contextual menu (right-click, Ctl+click) when a file =
or
folder is selected is ``Make Symbolic Link'' which will create a symbolic
link with the name ``originalname symlink'' in that directory. You can
change the name and move it wherever you wish after that. The command =
seems
slow but it works; I'm sure it's doing a ln in the background. I'm using
10.3.5.

Does anyone else have that? Where are these contextual menu items stored?

Good Luck,

I don't see this with contextual menus in the Finder (with 10.3.5). Do=20=

you have any special extension installed? Contextual menu items live in=20=

/Library/Contextual Menu Items and similar. For example, on my disk=20
there is:
