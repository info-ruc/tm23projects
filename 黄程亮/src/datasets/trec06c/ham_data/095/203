Hi Dmdxers

Thanks Jonathan for your attention to analyse.  I've run the new analyse on
the data I sent Ken, and no longer get spurious 2s (see start of new das
file below).  But analyse seems to be missing some incorrect responses that
are there.  For instance, subjects 4 and 5 appear as having no incorrect
values, but, according to the azk file, subj 4 makes one error on trial 112
(in the yes lefthand category) and subj 5 makes one error on trial 130 (in
the right hand no category).  These trials do seem to be included in the spc
file, so I'm not sure what's wrong.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Virginia Holmes
