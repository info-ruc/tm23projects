                       Call for Papers for 

                     "Methods for Modalities"

          A Special Issue of the Journal of Applied Logic
      (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/15708683)

The workshop `Methods for Modalities' (M4M) organized every two 
years aims to bring together researchers interested in developing 
proof tools and decision methods for modal logic broadly conceived,
including description logic, hybrid logic, temporal logic, etc.

During 1993 M4M-3, the third instance of the workshop was organized 
in Nancy, France.  We have been invited by the Journal of Applied 
Logic to prepare a Special Issue containing selected publications 
from the workshop, in addition to other articles that might fit 
within the  topics of interest of M4M.   For that reason we are now
distributing this Call for Papers.  


TOPICS OF INTEREST OF M4M

The following list is provided as an example of suitable topics for
the Special Issue. All topics should concern modal-like logics,
broadly conceived.  The list is by no means exhaustive and is given 
in an arbitrary order:

* Automated theorem proving
* Decision methods
* Proof methods
* Standard and non-standard inference problems
* Model checking
* Testing
* Expressive power
* Modelling
* Applications
* Successful uses of modal-like languages in other fields
* Knowledge representation


SUBMISSION DETAILS

The final version of accepted papers has to follow the standard 
layout guidelines of the Journal of Applied Logic.  Instructions 
for authors and the latex style files are available from
 
   http://staff.science.uva.nl/~m4m/SI/ 

Although not mandatory, we suggest to use the corresponding style
files from that web-page also for your initial submission. The 
issue aims at high quality papers with a length around 20 to max. 30
pages. Please send your submission in postscript or pdf no later 
than October 31th, 2004 to

   areces@loria.fr. 

Notice that all papers will be refereed to ensure that their
suitability for journal publication.
