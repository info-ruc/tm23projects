   Two new things in DMDX 3.0.4.1 and TimeDX 3.1.03.  First is the ability 
in TimeDX to specify the name of the Keithley DLL should you be cursed with 
having to use such miserable hardware.  I haven't got the hardware to test 
this right now so Maarten van Casteren will have to test it -- if it 
doesn't work I'll arrange to borrow the hardware again and fix it then.

   The second is that should DMDX or TimeDX not be able to read or write to 
the HKEY LOCAL MACHINE section of registry they try the HKEY CURRENT USER 
section instead.  This means that installations on multi user machines will 
work without any registry permissions chicanery and limited accounts can 
likewise run DMDX (although they still complain that they can't open 
diagnostics.txt which is no big deal).  It also means that on multi user 
installations every user will have to run TimeDX and time individual values 
that haven't been timed by the user that installed it (it's possible that 
they will be able to read keys but not write them).  Which of course opens 
large cans of worms if something goes awry and it becomes critical just 
what version of which key is being used when; but hey, you win some and you 
loose some.

just as much blood when you grab a thorn.
