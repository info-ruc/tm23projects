To apply interval methods to MINLPs, one just uses the general
recipes from continuous global optimization, with a few modifications
to take care of integer constraints:

1. When splitting an interval [a,b] for an integer variable,
instead of splitting at, say, the midpoint c one splits at the two
integers c_1 and c_2 closest to c, and gets the smaller
halves [a,c_1] and [c_2,b].

2. When using optimality conditions in an interval Newton method,
one needs to treat all integer variables as parameters, not as variables; otherwise one might lose solutions.

3. One can use many standard techniques from MIP to add useful
cutting planes.

You may wish to read Ivo Nowak's work on MINLP:
http://www-iam.mathematik.hu-berlin.de/~ivo/minlp.html
His work contains a lot of relevant material, although he uses
intervals only in a heuristic, nonrigorous fashion.
