Dear Friends, 

I hope someone more knowledgeable than me in robust control can answer these 
questions. If I understand correctly, by a discrete system the author (as usual 
in control) means discrete-time system, in which the dynamics is described by a 
different equation x(t+1)=f(x(t)) rather than by a differential equation in a 
continuous system. 

Some answers (definitely quite some answers to the second question) can be 
probably found in the well-known books (both listed on the Books part of the 
interval computations website) 

Robust Control: The Parametric Approach by S. P. Bhattacharyya, Herve 
Chapellat, and Lee Keel, Prentice-Hall, 1995. 

New Tools for Robustness of Linear Systems, by B. R. Barmish, McMillan, New 
York, 1994. 

There is also a lot about robust control in a more recent book

Applied Interval Analysis, with Examples in Parameter and State Estimation, 
Robust Control and Robotics, by Luc Jaulin, Michel Kieffer, Olivier Didrit, and 
Eric Walter, Springer-Verlag, 2001, ISBN 1-85233-219-0.

Dear Sir,
I am Professor S.Neduncheliyan, working in one of the
Engg College in India. I am doing research in the
field of system stability using Interval Analysis. I
kindly request you to give me some ideas (
methodology) with examples for the following problems:

1.How to get the discrete interval system from
continous interval system?.
2. How to find the controllability and obsevability of
continous system and discrete interval systems?.

Sir, please do this help for me.

Thanking You

Yours Truly
Prof S.Neduncheliyan
