Dear Colleagues,

I recently formulated an example in a "Mathematica" proficiency exam that,
although mathematically very elementary, reveals much about  the "naive"
interval arithmetic approach and, perhaps, about prejudices (and sources
thereof) against interval arithmetic.  I present my example and correspondence
with the student (without names, to protect confidentiality).  I have also
edited some of the comments.

People are welcome to use this example in elementary texts (should they be
writing one) or in courses and tutorials.

My conclusion is that, although it is possible to "oversell" interval
arithmetic, we still haven't reached everyone we should, especially
at an elementary level.  That is, using
business language, the market for intervals still isn't "saturated".
A second conclusion is that one should be careful, even with
simple problems :-)

Best regards,

Baker

==============================================================================
The exam question:

A. A petroleum storage tank in the shape of a circular cylinder has an
   inner radius of between 4.95 and 5.05 meters, and a height of between
   7.95 meters and 8.05 meters.  The thickness of the vertical walls
   varies between 1.99cm and 2.01cm, and the density of the wall material
   (steel) is between 7.85 and 7.91 grams per cubic centimeter.

   Use Mathematica's interval arithmetic capability to compute lower
   and upper bounds, sharp to within "roundout" error, to the following:

      (1) the total volume of the tank;

      (2) the weight of the vertical walls in kilograms.

   Although the actual computations are relatively simple, present the
   computations in an organized way, and place your explanation and report
   directly in the Mathematica notebook.  Format the notebook, including
   the comments, in a way that makes it easy and pleasing to read.


==============================================================================
The student's initial solution (with some of the explanation omitted):

r1 = 100*Interval[{4.95, 5.05}]

h = 100*Interval[{7.95, 8.05}]

thick = Interval[{1.99, 2.01}]

r2 = r1 + thick

\!\(Volume1\  = \ \[Pi]*\((r1)\)\^2*h\)

\!\(Volume2\  = \ \[Pi]*\((r2)\)\^2*h\)

VolumeWall = Volume2 - Volume1

 (output) : \!\(Interval[{\(-2.8057162558073882`*^7\), 3.813181213445664`*^7}]\)

d = 0.001* Interval[{7.85, 7.91}]

 weight = VolumeWall*d

 (output): Interval[{-221932., 301623.}]

(student's comment): We see that the interval solution is too wide to be
meaningful.

==============================================================================

My response to the student:

Your knowledge of Mathematica seems to be OK, but your use of interval
arithmetic is naive, since there is interval dependency;  additional
thought leads to a better  result.  In particular, the volume of the wall is

\pi * (r2^2 - r1^2) * h

You should get the exact range of volume, within roundout error,
if you evaluate the above expression with interval arithmetic.

The way you did it was to evaluate

\pi*r2^2 h - \pi*r1^2 h.

There is interval dependency in this second expression, since h
occurs twice in it.

Please redo this part of the project, using the correct formula
for the range of the volume of the vertical walls.

==============================================================================
The student's response:

    I still don't understand the term "roundout
error". I was serching in mathematica handbook for
that but I didn't see anything. I don't know also the
meaning of "exact range". Do you mean that after we
have got the interval of volume of the wall(by using
the formula pi*r2^2 h - \pi*r1^2 h) we have to use the
command in mathematica to find the exact range of the
volume?
I did check the lecture notes about interval
arithmetic and I didn't see anything about exact
range. I also searched for that term in many books,
and I still have no idea about that.

After I have used the formula pi*(r2^2-r1^2)* h,
I still got an interval with very big width.

==============================================================================
My second response:

Suppose you have a function f(x_1...,x_n), and evaluate it with interval
arithmetic.  Then the interval value \f(\x_1,...,\x_n) will always give
bounds on the range of the function, and will give the exact
range, in general, if and only if each symbol x_i occurs only once
in the expression.  If such a "single use expression" is evaluated
with floating point arithmetic, the result is not exactly the
range, since the lower end points are "rounded down" and the
upper end points are "rounded up".  That is "roundout error."
Some of this is explained in the introductory sections of my
book "Rigorous Global Search: Continuous Problems" (QA402.5 .K388 1996).


The problem is that there is still interval dependency, since
you defined

r2 = r1+thick,

so

    \pi *( r2^2 - r1^2) h = \pi ( (r1 + thick)^2 - r1^2) h

and r1 occurs more than once in the expression.  Rewrite
the parenthesized expression as

   (r1 + thick)^2 - r1^2) = 2*r1*thick + thick^2
                          = thick*(2*r1+thick)

(Please try that.)

You will get a better result, but it still won't give the exact
range to within roundout error.

To get the exact range, note that the minimum possible volume
corresponds to using

     \tilde r1 = sup(r1)

and

     \tilde r2 = min(r2)

and that the maximum possible volume corresponds to using

     \hat r1 = inf(r1)

and

     \hat r2 = sup(r2)

Storing \tilde r1 and \tilde r2 in intervals (whose endpoints are
the same), you will then use interval arithmetic to compute

inf(\pi (\tilde r2^2 - \tilde r1^2) h)

and

sup(\pi *\hat r2^2 - \hat r1^2) h).

These values will give lower and upper bounds on the range of volume that are
exact to within roundout error.

(Please also try this second scheme and submit to me.)
