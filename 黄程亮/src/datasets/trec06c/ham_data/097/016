If you are interested in practical applications of interval analysis
you may look at the applications part of:
http://www-sop.inria.fr/coprin/logiciels/ALIAS/Examples/index.html

in which examples in mechanism theory and robotics are presented. Most of them
present results that have been used for industrial applications.
