As vrea sa post urmatorul mesaj pe site-ul clubului:

Ma numesc Roxana Popovici si incerc sa pun la un loc un club de Scrabble in romaneste, inilniri saptaminale si un campionat periodic in New York City.  Ca locatie intiala, cred ca the Romanian Cultural Center on 38th and 2nd ar fi o optiune sau daca nu poate are cineva o idee mai buna.  Am sa pun la dispozitie jocurile si dictionare de Scrabble.  Daca sinteti interesati, send me an email at Roxana.Popovici@ubs.com.

Multumesc,
Roxana
