   That's GDI scaling your images for you, none too sophisticated.  If you 
need them scaled better than that either make the source images much larger 
or do the scaling yourself with some program that re-samples the image and 
thus does a better job than GDI does.  I like IrfanView myself, free and it 
does a good job of scaling things.  http://www.irfanview.net/

   T is in milliseconds, it's going to be a rare person that can react in 
100ms.

   You want to use the <Delay> parameter to set your ISI, by default it's 
something around 1/2 a second.  Which still doesn't explain your large 
ISI.  It probably takes your machine eons to read those pictures, have a 
look at the preparation times in the diagnostic window.
