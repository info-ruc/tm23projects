Dear all,

I am a senior undergraduate at Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Indian =
Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am currently working on a constrained =
optimization problem and trying to solve it with the help of interval =
analysis.=20

I was looking forward to some guidance in direction of algorithms and =
techniques available to solve ODEs using interval analysis. I would be =
very grateful if someone could cite me suitable references to help me =
solve ODEs using interval analysis.

Awaiting for a reply in anticipation.

Regards,
Aditya Agarwal
