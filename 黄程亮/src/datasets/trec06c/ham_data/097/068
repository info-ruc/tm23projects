      =========================================
                     IEEE International Conference on
                 Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems
                        June 30 - July 1, 2005
                    Marina del Rey, California, USA
     =========================================

                               WWW.DCOSS.ORG

The 2005 International Conference on Distributed Computing in Sensor Systems
(DCOSS '05) will take place in Marina del Rey during June 30 - July 1, 2005.
DCOSS is motivated by the successful ALGOSENSORS '04 (Algorithmic aspects of
wireless sensor networks) workshop, which was co-located with ICALP and LICS
in Finland on 16 July, 2004.  While the scope of ALGOSENSORS was focused on
algorithms for wireless sensor networks, DCOSS '05 is intended to cover
several aspects of distributed computing in sensor systems such as
high level abstractions, computational models, systematic design
methodologies, algorithms, analysis and applications.  The conference will
provide a forum for researchers and practitioners to present their
contributions related to the above high-level aspects of distributed sensor
systems.  In addition to contributed papers, the meeting will also include
keynote addresses by leading researchers, a panel discussion, and a
poster/presentation session.

Located in Marina del Rey, a beach side community that is the home of the
world's largest man-made harbor,  the meeting venue can be easily reached
from the Los Angeles International Airport (LAX).  Most of the world famous
attractions of the greater Los Angeles area - including the Santa Monica
mountains, the Getty Center, Hollywood, Venice Beach, Disneyland, and
Universal Studios can be easily reached from the Marina.

                      ==============================

CALL FOR PAPERS

Distributed sensor systems have become a highly active research area due
to their potential for providing diverse new capabilities.  Such systems
allow intelligent dense monitoring of physical environments, which makes
them immensely useful for data collection and analysis.  While much
ongoing research has addressed networking, communication and low-level
self-configuration issues in such systems, there are also significant
challenges pertaining to systematic design, algorithm development and
analysis, and abstract modeling in order to achieve efficient and robust
realizations of large-scale distributed sensor systems.  The large number
of sensor devices involved, severe power, computational and memory
limitations, resource heterogeneity, dense deployment and frequent
failures pose novel challenges to design, algorithms, analysis and
implementation.

The focus of the conference is on distributed computing issues in
large-scale networked sensor systems (including algorithms, applications,
and systematic design techniques and tools), but networking-related
contributions that support high level abstractions are also welcome.
Topics of interest  include but are not limited to:

       - Computation and programming models
       - Energy models, minimization, awareness
       - Distributed algorithms for collaborative information processing
       - Theoretical performance analysis: complexity, correctness,
              scalability, fault-tolerance
       - Abstractions for modular design
       - Languages, operating systems
       - Task allocation, reprogramming and reconfiguration
       - Dynamic resource management
       - Scalable, heterogeneous architectures (node and system-level)
       - Middleware interfaces, communication and processing primitives
       - Design, simulation and optimization tools for deployment
              and operation
       - Design automation and application synthesis techniques
       - Case studies: lessons from real world deployments

Authors are invited to submit original unpublished manuscripts that
demonstrate current research on computational aspects of distributed
sensor systems.  Submitted manuscripts may not exceed 14 single-spaced
pages using 12-point size font on 8.5x11 inch pages, including figures
and tables.  References may be included in addition to the 14 pages.
Authors need to make sure that the electronically submitted files are
formatted for 8.5x11 inch paper.  Submissions will be judged on correctness,
originality, technical strength, significance, quality of presentation, and
interest and relevance to the conference attendees.  Submitted papers
may not have appeared in or be under consideration for another conference
or a journal.

Submission procedures are available via Web access at http://www.dcoss.org/

All manuscripts will be reviewed.  Manuscripts must be received by
January 10, 2005, by 5 p.m. U.S. Pacific Coast Time.
Notification of review decisions will be mailed by March 15, 2005.
Camera-ready papers will be due April 15, 2005.

DCOSS '05 Proceedings will be distributed at the Conference.
