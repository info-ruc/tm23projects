Thanks JCF, I'll remove the recent DMDX and install the earlier one. 

In the mean time I have two questions (Doesn't everybody <grin>). 

1) I am using commercially available JPEG images (photographs). When I run
an experiment I am getting a degradation of the images; it looks like a grid
is bleeding into the image. 

2) I am trying to run a recognition experiment whereby I am presenting
target pictures to be test later. I want the script below to present each
Amusement Park picture for 250ms followed by 100ms ISI. When I run this
script, rather than get a 2000ms overall time, I get an overall time in the
area of 7000ms.

   I have a repeated instance of the recent graphics not displaying error 
so it's real and no doubt I'll have a solution soon but till then the 
version 3.0.4.3 would appear to be the one to use rather than the latest 
ones if you want to display JPEGs.
