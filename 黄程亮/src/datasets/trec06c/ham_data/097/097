It may perhaps be of interest for you to take a look at the following rather
extensive paper, which studies the various approaches in Taylor Model-based
validated integrators. It also contains various comparisons of different
methods, and includes many links to the rest of the literature.

  Subject: Solving ODEs using Interval analysis


  Dear all,


  I am a senior undergraduate at Faculty of Chemical Engineering, Indian
Institute of Technology, Bombay. I am currently working on a constrained
optimization problem and trying to solve it with the help of interval
analysis.


  I was looking forward to some guidance in direction of algorithms and
techniques available to solve ODEs using interval analysis. I would be very
grateful if someone could cite me suitable references to help me solve ODEs
using interval analysis.


  Awaiting for a reply in anticipation.


  Regards,

  Aditya Agarwal
