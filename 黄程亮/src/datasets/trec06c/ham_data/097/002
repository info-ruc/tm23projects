Hi,

I am wondering if anyone can pls help me. I need to connect a response
button box (a 2-button and a 4-button) to a Toshiba Tecra S1 notebook which
is running XP. I need to know if and how to connect a button box to this
notebook, and, if a response button box isn't the best input device for
this type of notebook , then what is? As i am not very technical at all, i
am willing to provide any further info which may be required for someone to
help me.

Thanks a lot.
