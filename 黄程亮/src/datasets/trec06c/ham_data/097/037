It seems that people have no idea why we are changing names.
This was not made clear in the notice and many people are 
seeing it as frivolous and a colossal waste of time and effort.
The name has to be changed because we will soon swap out the Eta
Model and its 3DVAR analysis / Eta Data Assimilation System (EDAS) 
and replace them with the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) 
versions: NCEP's Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model (NMM) and a new 
Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) analysis.  

WRF is already running in NCEP's Production Suite in the HiResWindow 
slot.  A briefing package can be found at:
http://wwwt.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/mmb/mmbpll/wrftest/WRF-HRW-Readiness-Rev-13Sep04_files/v3_document.htm

WRF, in various flavors, will be running in several other slots
in the future (Eta, DGEX, RUC, Fire Weather/IMET Support, Homeland 
Security, Hurricane, SREF & Air Quality).  We can't have run slots 
named after the model that is running in them anymore because then 
all those slots would be WRF.  Therefore, we have chosen to re-name 
the Eta slots to eliminate the association with a particular model.

Speaking of the replacement of Eta, now NAM, by WRF-NMM -- we had 
been planning on doing that in late September 2005.  We have now 
targeted that replacement to occur in late March 2006.  This difficult
decision was made as a result of three factors: a) delayed delivery &
acceptance of NCEP's new computer upgrade (which has caused a backlog 
of implementations to build up); b) new and still evolving consequences
of the recent decision to put 50% of our computer system at the Fairmont
WV site and c) the complex and intricate nature of the new WRF system 
which has added to our planned development time.
