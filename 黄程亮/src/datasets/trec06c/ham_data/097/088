ISSAC'2005 Call for Papers

ISSAC is the yearly premier international symposium in Symbolic and
Algebraic Computation. It provides an opportunity to learn of new
developments and to present original research results in all areas of
symbolic mathematical computation. Planned activities include invited
presentations, research papers, poster sessions, tutorial courses, vendor
exhibits and software demonstrations.

ISSAC'2005 will be organized by the Key Laboratory of Mathematics
Mechanization, Chinese Academy of Sciences, from July 24-27, 2005 in
Beijing, China.

ISSAC'2005 web page:  http://www.mmrc.iss.ac.cn/~issac2005/
ISSAC'2005 e-mail:    issac2005@mmrc.iss.ac.cn

Important Dates
Deadline for Submissions:    January 14, 2005 (Midnight [24:00 EST])
Notification of Acceptance:  March 15, 2005
Camera-ready copy received:  April 15, 2005

Conference Topics
Topics of the meeting include, but are not limited to:

Algorithmic Mathematics
Algebraic, symbolic and symbolic-numeric algorithms. Simplification,
function manipulation, equations, summation, integration, ODE/PDE, linear
algebra, number theory, group theory and geometric computing. 

Computer Science
Theoretical and practical problems in symbolic computation. Systems,
problem solving environments, user interfaces, software, libraries,
parallel/distributed computing and programming languages for symbolic
computation, concrete analysis, benchmarking, theoretical and practical
complexity of computer algebra algorithms, automatic differentiation, code
generation, mathematical data structures and exchange protocols. 

Applications
Problem treatments using algebraic, symbolic or symbolic-numeric
computation in an essential or a novel way. Engineering, economics and
finance, physical and biological sciences, computer science, logic,
mathematics, statistics and education. 

Instructions to Authors 
Original research results and insightful analyses of current concerns are
solicited for submission. Submissions must not substantially duplicate
work published or submitted for publication elsewhere. Late submissions
will be rejected. Papers will be reviewed by the program committee and
additional referees. Proceedings will be distributed at the symposium.
Papers must be in English and should not exceed 8 pages in the standard
format for ACM proceedings, or 20 to 22 pages of text in LaTeX 12pt
article style. 

To submit your contribution, please visit the Paper Submission page.

Each paper should have an abstract as well as an introductory section
that: Describes the problem. Motivates the study of the problem. States
the main results and compares them to other work (including theoretical or
empirical performance). Summarizes the original aspects of the
contribution. Formatting requirements will be based on the ACM Proceedings
Templates. For instance, in LaTeX2e you should use the
acm_proc_article-sp.cls document class to format your document. 
For information concerning ACM Proceedings Templates see
http://www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html

Authors of accepted papers are expected to present their work at the
symposium, or make arrangements to have it presented, and will be required
to sign the ACM copyright agreement (www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_form.html)
Some papers may be accepted for poster-session presentation; these will
not appear in the proceedings. Abstracts of all posters will be
distributed at the symposium. For poster submissions please consult the
Call for Posters. 

Distinguished Paper Award
This award will be given to the most distinguished paper(s) presented at
ISSAC'2005. The distinguished paper(s) will be decided by the program
committee. 

Best Student Author Award
This award will be given to the best student author. An author who is a
full-time student at the time of submission is eligible for the award. 
This status should be indicated when the paper is submitted. 

For details concerning the selection procedure for this award as well as
the procedure for the ISSAC Distinguished Paper Award, see the ISSAC Award
Guidelines.
