FROM THE DESK OF:
Chow Wong Lee.
Wing Hang Bank Ltd.
Stubbs Road Branch,
Ground Floor, AIA Building,
1 Stubbs Road, Wan Chai,
Hong Kong.

  
I am Mr.Chow Wong Lee, Bank Manager Wing Hang Bank Ltd, 
Stubbs Road Branch, Hong Kong. I have urgent and very 
confidential  business proposition for you.
  
A British Oil consultant and contractor with the Chinese 
Solid Minerals
Corporation, Mr Raymond Beck made a numbered time (Fixed) 
Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at 
US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million United States Dollars) in 
my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to 
his forwarding address but got no reply. After a Month, we 
sent a reminder and finally  we discovered from his 
contract employers, the Chinese Solid Minerals Corporation 
that Mr.Raymond Beck  died in a plane crash along with his 
 wife Mr and Mrs Raymond & Dorene Beck in EgyptAir Flight 
990,1999 air  crash(for more information about this crash 
and person you can contact this website: 
http://www.s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm
  
Since we got this information about his death and on 
further investigation, I found out that he died without 
making a WILL, and all attempts to  trace his next of kin 
was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation  and 
discovered that Mr.Raymond Beck did not declare any Kin or 
Relations in all his official documents, including his 
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of 
US$12,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the 
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at 
the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to 
claim it. According to Laws of Hong Kong,  at the 
expiration of 7 (seven) years, the money will revert to 
the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody 
applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is 
that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in as the 
Next of Kin to Mr.Raymond Beck so that the fruits of this 
old man's labor will not get into the hands of some 
corrupt government officials.
  
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately 
your full Names and Address so that the Attorney will 
prepare the necessary Documents and Affidavits that will 
put you in place as the Next of Kin. We shall employ the 
services of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of 
the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter 
of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. 
A bank account in any part of the world that you will 
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to 
you as the Beneficiary/Next of Kin. The money will be paid 
into your account for us to share in the ratio of 90% for 
me and 10% for you.There is no risk at all as all the 
paperwork for this transaction will be done by the 
attorney and my position as the Branch Manager  guarantees 
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are 
interested, please reply immediately via the private email 
address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide 
you with more details and relevant documents that will 
help you understand the transaction. Please send me your 
confidential
telephone and fax numbers for easy communication.
  
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured 
that this transaction would be most profitable for both of 
us because I shall require your assistance to invest my 
share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply via my confidential email 
address: chow_wong3@uymail.com
Regards,
Chow Wong Lee . (Wan Chai, Hong Kong)
