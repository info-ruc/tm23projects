Dear Friends, 

Granular computing is a general idea that includes interval granules as a 
particular case. 

In view of this, it may be of intereste to the folks from the interval 
computations community, specially those who are interested in relations between 
intervals and fuzzy and knowledge representation, that 
the Administrative Committee of the IEEE Computational Intelligence
Society has recently approved the proposal to hold the 
IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing
at Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, July 25-27, 2005.

Professors T.Y. Lin and Ronald Yager kindly agreed to serve as 
General Chairs of this conference. 

This conference will be held back-to-back 
with the 11th World Congress of the International Fuzzy 
Systems Organization IFSA'05, Beijing, China, July 28-31, 2005.
