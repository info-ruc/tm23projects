Hi JCF,
   I running the following script

<azk><cr><fd 10><t 200><vm desktop><dbc 0><nfb><dwc 000255000>
0 "Ready SPACEBAR";
^001 * g "Amusement Park 014.jpg"/;
0 "The End. Thank You.";

I am getting a large discrepancy between passage of time I calculate and my
stopwatch. I'll assume my stopwatch is correct therefore I need my mental
model tweaked a little. 

Stopwatch time = 2040ms - from the moment the spacebar is pressed to the
moment the end is sounded.

In the script:

fd 10 = 10 x 16.4* = 164.00ms 
t                  = 100.00ms

Graphic file:
Preparation A      =  42.83ms
            B      =  18.22ms 


 Subtotal          = 325.05ms

    default ISI    = 500.00ms

      Total        = 825.05ms

	What is eating up the time? Is there a default I'm not taking into
consideration? 

	Thank you for any help you can offer.

	And, I hope you have a Happy Thanksgiving <smile> , 

--Steve 




*I hand calculated (stopwatch) a tick to be around 16.4 using fd 100 vs fd
200 is there a more precise method of computing a tick?

   G is equivalent to <bmp> or <jpeg>, it just doesn't offer any 
scaling.  The reason G fixes your artifacts is that it isn't scaling 
anything, you're seeing the image as it is.  When you use <jpeg 
0.25,0.25,0.75,0.75> DMDX scales the image to fit on half the screen 
centered in the middle.  The scaling is done by GDI, the Graphics Device 
Interface of Windows and it's a little rough and ready when it comes to 
scaling things.  If Microsoft ever add a nice re-sampler to GDI then DMDX's 
scaling of bitmaps will get nicer too.
