   And you've swept the machine for malware and viruses and so 
forth?  You've tried turning off the anti-virus if it's got 
one?  Uninstalling other weird software?  It sounds like something's gotta 
be interfering with the machine's ability to render bitmaps if they're 
displaying as black.  If you've got another hard disk lying around maybe 
you can try a clean install of XP and see if the problem goes away.  If the 
onboard video is still enabled but not used perhaps disabling it in the 
BIOS will change things.  If you're using an 8 bit (256 color) video mode 
use a 16 or 32 bit one instead -- the bitmaps are usually safe enough as 8 
bit as DMDX promotes them to whatever the display's color depth is but just 
about all 8 bit video modes are busted these days.
