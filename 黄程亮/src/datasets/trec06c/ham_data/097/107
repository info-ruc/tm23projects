A day-long tutorial workshop entitled "*What Monte Carlo Cannot Do:
Introduction to Imprecise Probabilities*" will be held at the Wyndham
Hotel & Resort in Palm Springs, California, on Sunday, 5 December 2004. 

The workshop review the limitations of Monte Carlo methods and describe
strategies to escape these limitations.  It will introduce the notions 
of interval-
valued probability and imprecisely specified probability distributions and
review their uses in risk analysis. It will introduce the approaches of 
interval
probabilities, probability bounds analysis, Dempster-Shafer theory, robust
Bayes methods, info-gap theory, and the theory of imprecise probabilities.
It will also illustrate how sparse, incomplete or imprecise data can be 
used
to fashion inputs without making strong or untenable assumptions.

The workshop will be held in conjunction with the Society for Risk Analysis
Annual Meeting, but you don't have to register for the annual meeting to
participate in the workshop.  The registration fee for the workshop is $175
before 10 November, or $205 after this date, or on site.
