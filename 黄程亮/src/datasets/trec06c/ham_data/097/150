Hi,

This is Chandan, co-president of the Society for International 
Undergraduates. This Thursday, 11th November, we are holding a 
discussion where we'll talk about the international students' 
perspective of US elections, George W. Bush, Kerry etc. and what they 
see as their role in US politics. We hope your club can either send 
someone to our event or advertise it via email. We welcome all voices, 
not just international students, but int'l students would be especially 
welcome. Below is the info about the event. We would be glad to know 
about your events and encourage our members to attend, if they are 
relevant to international students. Thanks.

International Students and American Politics – A Discussion
   **Thursday November 11**

The race is over, and Bush is the US President again. Are you
feeling triumphant? Scared out of your wits? Apathetic? On Thursday
night, join us in our double themed discussion:

* As an international student, do you have a duty to take a stance
on
US politics? Do you even have a right to?

*What are the implications and consequences of Bush's re-election
on your home country?

We're also inviting other interested parties such as the Columbia
Political Union and perhaps a professor. Munch on yummy
international food, hang out with your fellow
worldly mates, and express and hear other international views.
All are welcome in this friendly discussion!
