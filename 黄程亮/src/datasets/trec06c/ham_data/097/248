   Thanks for the support. I managed to back into a solution based on your
hints. When I enter <bmp> I have to included top left corner x and y
co-ordinates and the bottom right: e.g., "<bmp 0.1,0.1,0.9,0.9>". Two digit
parameters produce on my machine a DDERR_INVALIDPARAMS error.
    I googled the error, but I'm not familar with game development to make
any sense of the responses I got. The only word that was recognizable was
DirectX.
    Again, thank you for the help.

   Have you tried the DMDX demo and it's bitmaps?  Perhaps the ones you are 
trying to use no longer work (although I'll be impressed, it's not like 
that code has changed in half a decade).
