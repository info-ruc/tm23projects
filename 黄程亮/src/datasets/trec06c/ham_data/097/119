Dear Colleagues,

My recommendations to the student in the "classroom example" were
not exactly correct.  Despite the problem being "simple,"
it took some additional discussion between me and the student
to correctly get exact bounds on the range, to within
"roundout error."  I append again the problem, followed by a
correct solution.  Are we right?

(I have edited the Mathematica notebook and have supplied more nearly universal
"TeX-like" notation).

Best regards,

Baker

The exam question:

A. A petroleum storage tank in the shape of a circular cylinder has an
   inner radius of between 4.95 and 5.05 meters, and a height of between
   7.95 meters and 8.05 meters.  The thickness of the vertical walls
   varies between 1.99cm and 2.01cm, and the density of the wall material
   (steel) is between 7.85 and 7.91 grams per cubic centimeter.

   Use Mathematica's interval arithmetic capability to compute lower
   and upper bounds, sharp to within "roundout" error, to the following:

      (1) the total volume of the tank;

      (2) the weight of the vertical walls in kilograms.

   Although the actual computations are relatively simple, present the
   computations in an organized way, and place your explanation and report
   directly in the Mathematica notebook.  Format the notebook, including
   the comments, in a way that makes it easy and pleasing to read.


==============================================================================
A correct solution:

(1) To find the volume of the tank, we use the inner radius of
the tank and the height of the tank. Use the volume formula for
the cylinder. We convert the unit of the radius and height of
the tank to be in centimeters instead of meters:

(Input): r1 = 100*Interval[{4.95, 5.05}]

(Input): h = 100*Interval[{7.95, 8.05}]

(Input): VolTank  =\pi*r1^2*h

(Output):Interval[{6.119661482569413*10^8, 6.449536565177991*10^8}]

The thickness of the vertical walls varies between 1.99 cm and 2.01 cm:

(Input): thick = Interval[{1.99, 2.01}]

We give the density of the vertical wall in kilograms per cubic centimeter:

(Input): d = 0.001* Interval[{7.85, 7.91}]


Let us find the exact range of the weight of the wall. To find
the exact range of weight of the wall. We have to find the
minimum and maximum possible volume of the wall first.  To this end,
we note that, for a given thickness, the volume of the wall is an
increasing function of the inner radius:

(Input): tilr1 = Min[r1]

(Input): tilr2 = tilr1 + Min[thick]

(Input): hatr1 = Max[r1]

(Input): hatr2 = hatr1 + Max[thick]

Now we use the interval arithmetic for these radius to find the
maximum and minimum possible for the volume of the wall:

(Input): LoBoundVol  = Min[ \pi*(R2^2 - R1^2))*h]

(Input): RR1 = Interval[hatr1]

(Input): RR2 = Interval[hatr2]

(Input): UpBoundVol  =  Max[\pi*(RR2^2 - RR1^2)*h]

(Input): IntervalVolume = Interval[{LoBoundVol, UpBoundVol}]

(Output): Interval[{4.930345702783755*10^6, 5.144303873599082*10^6}]

(Input): BWeight = IntervalVolume*d

(Output): Interval[{38703.2, 40691.4}]
