Bartlomiej,

You might look at work by Dan Berliant or Scott Ferson.  If anyone has done
it, they would know.

I did some work with validated quadrature 20 years ago.  Gaussian quadrature
with interval remainder enclosure should work.

Taylor models of Martin Berz is another possibility.

Why do you need validated values of CDF of the normal distribution?  You
have an analytic means of computing, and a symbolic package such as Maple or
Mathematica can give you values to many places.
