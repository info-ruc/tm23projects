	Thanks for quick reply. Over here at Pace University all our
machines have Symantec Corporate AV program installed. I am unable to close
the program. I do hope that is not the problem. I took part of your advise
and install DMDX on a Dell Optiplex GX 240 machine with ATI RAGE 128 Pro
Ultra GL AGP with display settings at 1024 by 768 pixel (Color set 32bit).
I'm still not able to see bitmaps in the DMDX.
	I'm going to try to get to a machine that has no AV software on it,
and see what happens. 

Thanks for the suggestions, Steve

   And you've swept the machine for malware and viruses and so 
forth?  You've tried turning off the anti-virus if it's got 
one?  Uninstalling other weird software?  It sounds like something's gotta 
be interfering with the machine's ability to render bitmaps if they're 
displaying as black.  If you've got another hard disk lying around maybe 
you can try a clean install of XP and see if the problem goes away.  If the 
onboard video is still enabled but not used perhaps disabling it in the 
BIOS will change things.  If you're using an 8 bit (256 color) video mode 
use a 16 or 32 bit one instead -- the bitmaps are usually safe enough as 8 
bit as DMDX promotes them to whatever the display's color depth is but just 
about all 8 bit video modes are busted these days.
