              Buffer Overflow in Microsoft Internet Explorer

 
  Original release date: November 10, 2004
  Last revised: --
  Source: US-CERT


Systems Affected

   Microsoft Windows systems running

     * Internet Explorer versions 6.0 and later; previous versions of
       Internet Explorer may also be affected

     * Other programs that host the WebBrowser ActiveX control


Overview

   Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) contains a buffer overflow
   vulnerability that could allow a remote attacker to execute
   arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running IE.


I. Description

   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the way IE handles the
   SRC and NAME attributes of various elements, including FRAME,
   IFRAME, and EMBED. Because IE fails to properly check the size of
   the NAME and SRC attributes, a specially crafted HTML document can
   cause a buffer overflow in heap memory. Due to the dynamic nature
   of the heap, it is usually difficult for attackers to execute
   arbitrary code using this type of vulnerability.

   However, if heap memory is prepared in a special manner, an
   attacker could execute arbitrary code more easily. Publicly
   observed exploits use scripting to prepare the heap, though this
   may be accomplished without scripting. Without the ability to
   prepare the heap, the impact is most likely limited to denial of
   service.

   This vulnerability is described in further detail in VU#842160.


II. Impact

   By convincing a user to view a specially crafted HTML document
   (e.g., a web page or an HTML email message), an attacker could
   execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. The
   attacker could also cause IE (or any program that hosts the
   WebBrowser ActiveX control) to crash.

   Reports indicate that this vulnerability is being exploited by
   malicious code propagated via email. When a user clicks on a URL in
   a malicious email message, IE opens and displays an HTML document
   that exploits the vulnerability. This malicious code may be
   referred to as MyDoom.{AG,AH,AI} or Bofra.


III. Solution

Until a complete solution is available from Microsoft, consider the
following workarounds:

Install Windows XP SP2

   Microsoft Windows XP SP2 does not appear to be affected by this
   vulnerability. If you are using Windows XP, please update to SP2.

Disable Active scripting

   To help protect against attacks that use scripting to prepare the
   heap, disable Active scripting in any zone used to render untrusted
   HTML content (typically the Internet Zone and Restricted Sites
   Zone).  Instructions for disabling Active scripting in the Internet
   Zone can be found in the Malicious Web Scripts FAQ.

Do not follow unsolicited links

   Do not click on unsolicited URLs received in email, instant
   messages, web forums, or Internet relay chat (IRC) channels. While
   this is generally good security practice, following this behavior
   will not prevent exploitation of this vulnerability in all
   cases. For example, a trusted web site could be compromised and
   modified to deliver exploit script to unsuspecting clients.

Read and send email in plain text format

   Outlook 2003, Outlook 2002 SP1, and Outlook 6 SP1 can be configured
   to view email messages in text format. Consider the security of
   fellow Internet users and send email in plain text format when
   possible. Note that reading and sending email in plain text will
   not necessarily prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.

Maintain updated anti-virus software

   Anti-virus software with updated virus definitions may identify and
   prevent some exploit attempts. Variations of exploits or attack
   vectors may not be detected. Do not rely solely on anti-virus software
   to defend against this vulnerability. More information about viruses
   and anti-virus vendors is available on the US-CERT Computer Virus
   Resources page.
