Re: Workshop on Applications of Interval Methods

In August 2005, we are again arranging a workshop in Copenhagen 
on interval analysis and its applications. This time, the focus will
be on applications. 

The Second Scandinavian Workshop on Interval Methods and Their
Applications will take place at the Technical University of Denmark
during August 25-27, 2005. 

...

Best wishes
Kaj.
