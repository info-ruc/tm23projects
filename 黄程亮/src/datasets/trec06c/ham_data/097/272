You've done it again. You solved my image quality problem.

I was using 

^001  *<jpeg 0.25,0.25,0.75,0.75> "Amusement Park 014"/;
^002 * <jpeg 0.25,0.25,0.75,0.75> "Amusement Park 027"/;  

your hint of the g, that is,

^001 * g "Amusement Park 014.jpg"/;
^002 * g "Amusement Park 027.jpg"/;  

cleared up the image problem.  

   Thank you, Steve

   Ok, found the missing JPEG problem and it's fixed in 3.1.1.3.  No, it 
wasn't Microsoft's GDI+ patch (thankfully) and was instead a slight 
oversight when I made 1.0 a scaled value for BMP multipliers instead of 
pixel coordinate 1 -- a change so trivial I didn't even log it.  And it 
tended not to show up around here because we tend to use G instead of <bmp> 
or <jpeg>.

One nice thing about egotists: they don't talk about other people.
