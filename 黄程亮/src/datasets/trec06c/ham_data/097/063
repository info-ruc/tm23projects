Dear Interval Researchers,

I need to have the validated values of CDF of the normal distribution.
Obviously, it can be simply obtained by integrating (in interval
arithmetic) the formula for the PDF (which is well-known).

Two questions arrise:

1) Did anyone do it before ?
2) Which method of integration can you recommend ?

Thank you for any advices and best regards
	Bartlomiej Kubica
