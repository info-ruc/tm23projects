Thanks for your suggestions. I think the problem arose due to a mixture of
bad coding* and my graphics card being very iffy with the latest version of
dmdx.  The below code, in combination with "DMDX for GeForce graphics
cards", and also using DMDX version 3.0.1.3, lets me present pictures as I
require. However, my graphics card is definitely not behaving with the
latest version of dmdx, as none of my previous correctly coded experiments
display any pictures at all using the latest version.  I reckon someone in a
similar predicament should go ahead with Gareth's idea of fiddling with
buffer settings**.

Thanks again, Andy.

* I wanted pictures to remain on the screen until a button press.  I used
the ending "/ , /;" previously, which probably explains why my bmp's
appeared very briefly and then disappeared. 


**last 4 months of phd and still testing. Can't risk not having this machine
to test on!  Will look into the problem when I stop testing.

Hi Andy,

This error (where the display fails after a certain number of trials) 
sometimes happens to us when we use NVidia cards which require the use of 
the "-buffers " option on the command line.

Try running DMDX with "-buffers 4" and see if this helps.

fingers crossed,

Matt
