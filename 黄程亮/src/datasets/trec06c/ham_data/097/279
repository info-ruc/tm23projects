   Well there's the ISI from the space bar instruction and the ISI from 
item 1 so that's twice the ISI you're allowing for.  And without specifying 
a Delay parameter DMDX takes it's own sweet time, there isn't a rigorous 
ISI till D or <Delay> is used.

   TimeDX displays the retrace interval in both the Refresh Rate test and 
the Time Videlo Mode test.  Perhaps when you timed the display mode TimeDX 
didn't do it correctly.  I find I need to tell a number of machines these 
days to Read Between Flips to stop Cheating Drivers in the Refresh Rate 
test otherwise TimeDX can make pretty poor guesses at the retrace interval.
