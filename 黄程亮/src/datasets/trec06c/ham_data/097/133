Dear Friends, 

Our interval colleague Chenyi Hu is planning to organize an interval session at 
the 11th International Fuzzy Systems Association will have its 2005 World
Congress in Beijing, China. http://ifsa2005.em.tsinghua.edu.cn/ 

The proposal for an interval sesion is due on December 20, 2004. If you are 
interested, please send him an email (copy to me). His email is chu@uca.edu.

CALL FOR PAPERS
IFSA2005 World Congress
July 28-31, 2005, Beijing China 
http://ifsa2005.em.tsinghua.edu.cn

The 11th World Congress of International Fuzzy Systems Association
(IFSA 2005) will be held in Beijing China, July 28-31, 2005. As a
major bi-annual event of IFSA, the Congress aims at bringing together
scholars and practitioners from academia and industries to present the
latest development in theories and applications of fuzzy logic and
soft computing. The scientific program will include keynote/plenary
talks and technical parallel sessions that address important issues of
interest in the fields. The Congress will serve as a platform not only
for knowledge sharing, but also for stimulating new ideas in
broadening and deepening theoretical and applied explorations of fuzzy
logic and soft computing. Notably, IFSA2005 will take place in the
year of IFSA¡¯s 20th anniversary, which may well be an event of memory
and celebration in the course of its evolution. 

This IFSA World Congress is to be the first-time-ever in Mainland
China. China is a dynamic nation with a rapid economic growth and huge
market. The conference site is Beijing, which has been the capital of
China for about five hundred years, and is now one of the largest
international cities in the world. Nowadays, as the cultural,
educational and Hi-tech center of the nation, Beijing possesses a
large number of world-class conference facilities, communication
infrastructures and hotels, and has successfully hosted many important
international conferences. In addition, Beijing is an ideal place for
sightseeing. Its rich cultures and historical attractions such as the
Great Wall, Forbidden City, Summer Palace, and Temple of Heaven will
provide participants with unique experiences for social activities. 

Topics
We solicit papers on theoretical issues and their applications related
to fuzzy logic and soft computing. Suggested topics include but are
not limited to: 
* Mathematical Foundations of Fuzzy Set Theory 
* Fuzzy Logic and Approximate Reasoning 
* Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms and Soft Computing 
* Fuzzy Control, Robots and Intelligent Techniques 
* Expert Systems and Computational Intelligence 
* Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining 
* Rough Sets and Evidence Theory 
* Uncertainty in Decision Sciences and Optimization 
* Signal/Image Processing and Pattern Recognition 
* Fuzzy Databases and Information Retrieval 
* Hybrid Systems
