   G is equivalent to <bmp> or <jpeg>, it just doesn't offer any 
scaling.  The reason G fixes your artifacts is that it isn't scaling 
anything, you're seeing the image as it is.  When you use <jpeg 
0.25,0.25,0.75,0.75> DMDX scales the image to fit on half the screen 
centered in the middle.  The scaling is done by GDI, the Graphics Device 
Interface of Windows and it's a little rough and ready when it comes to 
scaling things.  If Microsoft ever add a nice re-sampler to GDI then DMDX's 
scaling of bitmaps will get nicer too.
