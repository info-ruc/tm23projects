   That's what "DMDX for GeForce graphics cards" does for you, specifically 
it runs with -buffers 4.  We've seen increased sensitivity with cards that 
previously had no troubles (TNT2) and my guess is that something has 
changed with SP2 of XP as none of the changes I've made in many months have 
been to fundamental graphics stuff.  However if a graphics driver is 
misbehaving all I have to do is change the size of an executable and 
failures will change their manifestation.  You certainly can't use 256 
color video modes any more and the "DMDX for GeForce graphics cards" 
shortcut appears to have solved the problems we've seen.  It's possible 
that the GDI+ fixes from Microsoft are the culprits as that's code that 
DMDX is likely to be using.  It's possible that changing file formats that 
the images use will solve the issue, use JPGs if you're using BMPs and vice 
versa.
