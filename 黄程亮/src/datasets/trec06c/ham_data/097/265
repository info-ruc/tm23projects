   Ok, found the missing JPEG problem and it's fixed in 3.1.1.3.  No, it 
wasn't Microsoft's GDI+ patch (thankfully) and was instead a slight 
oversight when I made 1.0 a scaled value for BMP multipliers instead of 
pixel coordinate 1 -- a change so trivial I didn't even log it.  And it 
tended not to show up around here because we tend to use G instead of <bmp> 
or <jpeg>.

One nice thing about egotists: they don't talk about other people.
