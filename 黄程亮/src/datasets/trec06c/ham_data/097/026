Hello Everyone,

To speed up the distribution of WES3.3, we decided to ship the WES3.3
install CD on Thursday, 28 October 2004 with another package WDTB is
putting together for the Advanced Warning Operations Course. The AWOC
facilitators will receive this on Friday 29 October, and that should
include someone from every forecast office and every regional
headquarters. Keep an eye out for this release, and if your AWOC
facilitator does not receive it, let us know. All sites, including the
beta test sites, are encouraged to install the final WES3.3 unless you
want to wait for WES4.0.

For the details of what is new in WES3.3, see:

http://strc.comet.ucar.edu/wes/documents/wes3.3new.pdf

WES3.3 includes: a copy of AWIPS OB3.3, improved performance in running
WES, and some bug fixes. WES will detect and fix your old cases to work
with OB3 to get around the AWIPS change of data structures. You will be
instructed to manually remove any links you created to work around the
hi res radar product display problem (using OB2.1 to view OB3 archived
data).

FYI, we are changing the WES release numbers to match the AWIPS with the
release. This should help you keep on top of customizing WES from your
AWIPS. As you upgrade your real-time AWIPS, I strongly recommend keeping
a copy of your customization stuff for use with the WES.

OB3 significantly impacted WES. Occasionally this happens because WES
isn't part of the AWIPS baseline, and it is generally not considered in
the development process. So far OB4 appears a more normal release as far
as its impacts on WES. So we are getting close to being ready for a beta
test of WES4.0 with OB4. Some of the new things we are trying to include
are: DMD, TRU, and the SCAN storm cells table. I'll send a message
requesting beta testers once we get an install CD tested internally. We
may start beta testing either next week or late November, and the
earliest we could see WES4.0 out is around Thanksgiving, perhaps into
early December.

If you have and questions or comments about all that is going on, don't
hesitate to ask.

Mike
