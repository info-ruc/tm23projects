Taylor Model Workshop 2004
Third International Workshop on Taylor Methods 
Miami Beach, December 16-20, 2004

     Location / Accommodation
The meeting will take place at Fontainebleau Hilton Resort, Miami Beach, 
Florida, USA. More information about the hotel and 
information about the meeting venue and possible activities can be found in 
the workshop webpage http://bt.pa.msu.edu/TM/Miami2004/

We have negotiated a special rate of 85$/night for meeting participants. 
This discounted rate is available three nights both prior to and after
the event. Room reservations can be made at 1-305-538-2000
(Fontainebleau Reservations) and referring to the "Taylor Model
Workshop" or "Michigan State University".

            Companion Meeting 
The Third International Workshop on Taylor Methods will be preceded by the 
 2004 Workshop on Status of Muon Collider Simulations. Muon Colliders
are novel particle accelerators. Taylor methods have been used for
their design and simulation for many years, and the meeting may be of
interest to some TM04 participants. It is planned to have some
relevant talks overlapping both meetings.

              Abstracts 
 Abstracts should be submitted as Ascii documents to Johannes Grote by
November 21, 2004.

             Registration
There will be no registration fees, the corresponding expenses will be 
covered. Please send registration information, including name, institution, 
postal and email address, to Johannes Grote

           Financial Assistance 
Limited resources for financial support are available, in particular for 
participating graduate students and others in need of assistance.
