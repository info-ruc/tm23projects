I was studying for my ph.d qual and I came across that I couldn't solve. I 
was
wondering if you wouldn't mind looking at it.

Let {f_n} be a sequence of measurable functions defined on a measurable set 
E with finite measure.
Suppose that a family {f_n} is pointwise bounded, that is for each x \in E, 
there is a
constant M_x such that |f_n(x)| <= M_x for all n. Show that for all epsilon 
 >0, there is a closed
set F \subset E with m( E-F) < \epsilon such that the family is uniformly 
bounded on F. That
is , show that  there is a constant M such that |f_n(x)| <= M for all x \in 
F and all n.

Any help you could give would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your time

Sarh Wright
