*********************************************************************

                 2nd ANNOUNCEMENT AND CALL FOR PAPERS

                               A3L-2005

                    Algorithmic Algebra and Logic
   Conference in Honor of the 60th Birthday of Volker Weispfenning
                    University of Passau, Germany
                          http://www.A3L.org

*********************************************************************

The A3L conference is intended to be the first one of a series of
conferences on symbolic computation but with focus on commutative
algebra and the combination of computer algebra with logic, e.g.
effective quantifier elimination. Work on algorithms, their
implementation, and practical application.

A3L will be held at the University of Passau, Germany, from April 3 to
6, 2005.


Paper Submission
----------------
Authors should submit not later than November 28, 2004, by email to
jsc@A3L.org and/or to proceedings@A3L.org, resp.

There are two possible types of submissions:

(A) extended abstracts (2-4 pages) for the conference proceedings volume
(B) full papers for a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic
    Computation.

Material that is submitted only as an extented abstract need not be
original. Also it may be published in a different form elsewhere
later.

For full paper authors (B), the usual rules of the JSC apply. The
additional submission of an extended abstract (A) is mandatory.


Important Dates
---------------
*Deadline for Submissions:              November 28, 2004

*Notification of Acceptance:            January 13, 2005

*Registration and Welcome Reception:    April 2, 2005

*Scientific Conference Program:         April 3-6, 2005


Conference Topics
-----------------
Topics of the meeting include, but are not limited to:

 -Algorithmic Mathematics: Algebraic, symbolic and symbolic-numeric
  algorithms. Manipulation of formulas from logic, simplification,
  function manipulation, equations, summation, integration and
  differentiation, ODE/PDE, linear algebra, number theory, group and
  geometric computing, effective quantifier elimination.

 -Formal Deduction: Combination of methods or systems from computer
  algebra and computer deduction, design and implementation issues in
  integrated systems, formal method problems requiring mixed computing
  and proving, case studies and applications.

 -Computer Science: Theoretical and practical problems in symbolic
  computation. Systems, problem solving environments, user interfaces,
  parallel/distributed computing, programming languages, theoretical
  and practical complexity of computer algebra algorithms, code
  generation, mathematical data structures and exchange protocols.

 -Applications: Problem treatments using algebraic, logic, symbolic or
  symbolic-numeric computation. Engineering, economics and finance,
  physical and biological sciences, computer science, logic,
  mathematics, statistics, education.


Instructions for Authors
------------------------
Latex styles and detailed author instructions are available at
www.A3L.org/instructions.

For both sorts of submissions the authors are asked to make clear in
the abstract and in the introduction what is the relation to Volker
Weispfenning's work. The relation may be very loose. In fact, due to
the very broad scope of Volker Weispfenning's work, most topics from
computer algebra will fit fine. Contributions from the areas of applied
algebra, complexity, or model theory are highly appreciated as well.
