Hi all,

I've had extensive experience running IFPS on WES.  One "gotcha" on WES,
right before you run 'installGFE', is to 'unsetenv PYTHONHOME'.  If you
don't do this, you'll get an 'undefined symbol' error and a reference to
cPickle.so

Its not too hard to get GFE to work in DRT mode along with D2D. East and
Gulf Coast WFOs have used the DRT capability on WES to practice ingesting
and editing TPC wind guidance into GFE.  DRT mode is not necessary to
convert from 15 to 16, but it may help to determine of all your changes are
OK.  If you try to run GFE using old data without using DRT, GFE will purge
your grids rather quickly :)

I've put together some instructions, for those who might like to get IFPS
onto WES:

ftp://ftp.werh.noaa.gov/share/awips/ifps/16/gfe16_on_wes.pdf

You can install multiple IFPS versions on WES, just be sure to have only one
server running at a time :)  All you need to do is create a new directory to
install the other IFPS version into, like /data/GFESuite15 and specify that
on the installGFE line.

Just be sure not to install GFE on the /awips directory tree.  This
directory tree can get wiped out in an upgrade.

Josh
