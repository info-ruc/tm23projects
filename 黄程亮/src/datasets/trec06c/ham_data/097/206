<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All students should be aware of this terrific summer program.  Paid internships are available with many many branches of state government.  When looking through the booklet look through the entire thing, and do not be afraid to apply for one that does not specifically list your major, if you feel you are well-qualified.  But for most geology -type majors, the jobs in the Department of Environment and Natural resources are most appropriate.  (Although if you are interested in archaeology look in Cultural resources too.)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a great summer job, gives you experience and something good for your resume, and most important allows you to see what it is like to work for the state and for them to check you out possibly for a permanent job down the road.  Many of our students have had these.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application deadline is mid-January.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to this website for info:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please let your undergraduate and graduate students know about these internship opportunities with the Dept of Pollution Prevention and Environmental Assistance. The closing date is Monday, November 29, 2004 for both positions. Applications (cover letter and resume) should be emailed to me at <A HREF="mailto:kelly_porter@ncsu.edu">kelly_porter@ncsu.edu</A>.

<P>And Also...

<P>MEAS Undergrads:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Announcements for internships and other opportunities are coming in at a goodly clip, and are being posted on our MEAS webpage.

<P><A HREF="http://www.meas.ncsu.edu/02-internships.html">http://www.meas.ncsu.edu/02-internships.html</A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please take a look at the sorts of options available, even it you won't be eligible for a few years. It is best to know what sorts of opportunities are out there, so you don't waste a summer flipping burgers when you could be getting a great experience that will help you land that first job!  MEAS undergrads have a strong record in getting into grad school and getting jobs, partly driven by the high proportion of you that participate in research and other summer activities related to your fields.

<P>Ginger:  Both Scott Cover (an MEAS secretary) and I have received the following email today.  I presume that some MEAS students will receive the same email in the near future.  You might want to post a warning on your Geology Club Web site against submitting a resume in response to such an email.  The following email clearly is a fake, presumably intended to solicit the personal information that would be contained within a resume.  That personal information could be used by some crook to take out a loan in the name of one of your Geology Club members.   ------------  Michael Kimberley

<BR>Subject: Summer Internship at NCGS

<P>Hey Skip,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a Student Summer Internship opportunity!!! If you know of any students that may be qualified/interested, please pass this email on to them. The description of the Internship is specific and involves the compilation of existing groundwater geochemical data and bedrock geologic data into a GIS/ARCVIEW platform. We may be able to modify the subject of the Internship some to better suite a students senior thesis or masters. The application deadline is January 19, 2005.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The summer program offers interns an $8.25 hourly wage for a 10-week working period. Students work 40 hours per week and participate in meetings, tours, and other activities designed to broaden their perspective of public service and state government. The application deadline is January 19, 2005. A detailed explanation of the summer internship program, applications, eligibility requirements can be found the the following web site.
<BR><A HREF="http://www.doa.state.nc.us/doa/yaio/intern.htm">http://www.doa.state.nc.us/doa/yaio/intern.htm</A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following is a description of the subject of the internship taken directly from the internship catalog:
<BR>Preliminary Correlation of Groundwater Geochemical Data to Bedrock Geology - Orange County, NC, Land Quality Major(s): Geology with GIS/ARCVIEW Knowledge, Environmental Science with GIS/ARCVIEW knowledge

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Project Objective: Assist the NC Geological Survey staff with the production of geologic bedrock maps and derivative land use planning maps of areas within Orange County, NC. Activities will include an independent field-mapping project coupled with the compilation of available groundwater geochemical data (primarily the dissolved metals: arsenic, lead and mercury) into an ARCVIEW/GIS platform. The groundwater geochemical data will be coupled with ongoing bedrock geologic mapping data to determine if zones of elevated groundwater metals concentrations can be correlated with the bedrock geology.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Major Tasks: Collection of geologic field data and compilation of County and State groundwater geochemistry data. Data will be entered into ARCVIEW GIS and correlated with bedrock geologic data.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Final Product or Outcome: The groundwater geochemical data and bedrock geologic maps will be combined to aid in the production of a water resource map for portions of Orange County.

<P>Geologic Map Distribution via Internet at the NC Geological Survey, Land

<P>Major(s):&nbsp;  Geography Geology

<P>Project Objective:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distribute geologic maps via the Internet by significantly increasing the number of maps available to agency clients (e.g., environmental and engineering firms, geological consultants, planners, State and local government, educators, and the general public).

<P>Work to date can be viewed at
<BR><A HREF="http://www.geology.enr.state.nc.us/National%20Geologic%20Map%20interface20030929/interface1-2.htm">http://www.geology.enr.state.nc.us/National%20Geologic%20Map%20interface20030929/interface1-2.htm</A>.

<P>Major Tasks:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use ArcMap and the computer program CORPSCON (intern will be provided brief training, if needed) to georegister geologic maps that have been scanned and compressed using Mr. Sid software and create "world files".  Prepare a citation list for each map georegistered using a MS Excel spreadsheet with established fields consistent with the National Geologic Map Database and National Geologic Map Image Library
<BR><A HREF="http://ngmdb.usgs.gov">http://ngmdb.usgs.gov</A>. Scan additional geologic maps as time allows using an available 42-inch high-resolution continuous roll HP scanner.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The secondary task is to enter the data from the MS Excel spreadsheet into the National Geologic Map database using proscribed Internet-based forms.  If the applicant has modest .html skills (or is willing to be trained), the intern will have the opportunity to modify a web page for each geologic map georegistered to include a map "thumbnail" brief description, author, etc. - all information taken from the MS Excel spreadsheet noted above.

<P>Final Product or Outcome:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About 50 scanned geologic map images georegistered and ready to be added to the map server (see URL in project objective).  MS Excel spreadsheet of geologic map identification fields ready for entry into the National Geologic Map Database and National Geologic Map Image Library <A HREF="http://ngmdb.usgs.gov">http://ngmdb.usgs.gov</A> and if possible an Internet page for each map georegistered.  The intern should be able to use these products to enhance their portfolio as a project completed to show a prospective employer.

<P>Hi, Folks,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three things:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, welcome back to school (if you are coming back to school!).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, we will be updating the mailing list, and putting all the names on a list serve thingy.  Ginger Sigmon has already done some of that.  Basically, I will use the "Returned Mail" from this mailing to eliminate some names from the current list.  If you want your name removed from our mailing lists, please let me know.  However, be advised that we have more than one list, and sometimes a name may be on one list and not another.  We don't want to annoy anyone, so if want your name removed and somehow your name doesn't disappear, please just remind us again.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Third, the Geology Club WebPage has a new, (much) shorter address.  The old one will work for some time to come, but the new one can ac
tually be remembered!

<P>Old address:
<BR><A HREF="http://www2.ncsu.edu/eos/service/pams/meas/geology_club/">http://www2.ncsu.edu/eos/service/pams/meas/geology_club/</A>

<P>New address:
<BR><A HREF="http://clubs.ncsu.edu/geology/">http://clubs.ncsu.edu/geology/</A>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Note the complete lack of "w"s.)

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We'll let you know of our first meeting this (academic) year.

Colleagues,

We will be offering a workshop for grad students and post-docs this summer.
So, once again, I am asking for your help in getting the word out to that
target audience.  Note that workshop size is limited and priority will be
giving to those entering or soon to enter the job market.  So, pass along
to your grad students, to key faculty at your graduate institution, or
other grad students or post-docs who might be interested.  Also note that
the application deadline is March 24.

Thanks very much,

Heather Macdonald

Preparing for an Academic Career in the Geosciences: A Workshop for
Graduate Students and Post-doctoral Fellows

July 29-August 1, 2004, University of Minnesota
Application deadline is March 24, 2004

The workshop page has links to the workshop overview and application form
<A HREF="http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/careerprep04/index.html">http://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/careerprep04/index.html</A>

Description and Goals
This workshop will bring graduate students and post-doctoral fellows
interested in an academic career together with geoscience faculty members
>from different institutional settings who have a range of expertise and
experience.  The workshop will provide a stimulating and resource-rich
environment in which to explore important facets of an academic career.
Three main goals of the workshop are for participants to become more
effective teachers, stronger candidates for academic jobs, and better
prepared for a quick start to teaching and research in the next stage of
their career.

During the workshop, each participant will
?Learn more about the job-search process.
?Learn about roles and responsibilities of faculty members in different
educational settings (e.g., two-year colleges, four-year colleges,
universities) and positions in other academic institutions (e.g., museums)
and meet informally with workshop leaders from a range of educational
settings
?Explore aspects of effective and innovative teaching.
?Design a research plan suitable for the next career stage.
?Learn about strategies for documenting strengths and accomplishments in
teaching and research and develop or revise supporting materials.
?Share ideas and strategies for stress- and time-management.
?Develop a personal action plan.

Activities
The workshop will include an early-career faculty panel, short
presentations on various topics, structured discussions, small-group
collaboration, and informal interaction and conversation. Participants will
leave with a broad understanding of academic options, specific strategies
for developing as teachers and scholars and for meeting competing demands,
and an expanded network of colleagues. Participants will be involved in
electronic discussion and preparation prior to the workshop to become
familiar with key issues and concepts and will follow-through with
post-workshop plans.

Dates
The workshop will begin at 5:00 pm on Thursday, July 29, and will formally
conclude after dinner on Saturday, July 31. Optional workshops will be
offered in the morning of Sunday, August 1.  We are also planning an

I have secured write permission for <a href="mailto:ABigChevy@aol.com">David Coffey</a> for the Geology Club Web Page.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings everyone! We're into the Spring semester of 2003!  New news!  <a href="mailto:ABigChevy@aol.com">David Coffey</a> has offered to help out with the Web Page.  I will be archiving what we have now, and then turning him loose with it!  In the past I have archived within the Club account the various pages before making any drastic updates.  That way, we can look back and see what we had at an earlier date.  For example, I have recently removed from the membership list the names of the students who are no longer here.  However, I still have that old page in the files if we need that information.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please keep in touch with both <a href="mailto:ABigChevy@aol.com">David</a> and myself, <a href="mailto:rfmelvin@eos.cnsu.edu">Bob Melvin</a>.  All suggestions are welcome.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Geopeople,

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As many of you know, Dr. Cavaroc is ending his long career as a professor at NC State at the end of this semester. To celebrate his many years of dedication to the university and to geology students, a Pig-Picking is being held in his honor on Saturday, April the 27th, at Dr. Stoddard's house (see directions below). The cost of the Pig-Picking will be $10/person, but...the Geology Club will pay for any NCSU geology student that wants to go.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anybody who has had (or knows) Dr. Cavaroc, is encouraged to come and celebrate his retirement. There will also be many NCSU geology alumni at VicFest who would like to meet current geology students (and may prove to be important employment contacts).

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Geology Club has to know how many students to expect, so RSVP by replying to this email by Wednesday (the 17th) morning.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Directions to Dr. Stoddard's house: Go north on Creedmoor Road (Highway 50) from Crabtree Valley.  Turn left at the very first stoplight (just before the Hardee's) onto Plaza Dr.  Take the fourth left onto Turnstone Dr.  Take the first right onto Contour Dr. (unpaved).  It is the first house on the left.  5805 Contour Dr.  (919) 571-9199

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Want to know more about Field Camp?

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Geology Club is going to have a meeting about Field Camp this Tuesday (March 5) at 6:00 PM. All of you who are required to take Field Camp are strongly encouraged to go (especially those of you who are going this summer). What we have lined up is:

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Dr. Stoddard is going to talk about the official stuff (cost, schedule, etc.) as well as any advice he can offer.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -George Phillips was a TA for Field Camp last summer and he will give us insights from that perspective. (He might have some slides too.)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -Amanda Parodi and Jim Chapman both went to Field Camp last summer as students and will be able to give us practical advice and information from our perspective.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please respond to this email if you plan on going. The Geology Club will probably get pizza for the meeting and I need to know how much to get.

<font face=Helvetica>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The John M. Parker III Geology Field Camp Scholarship will be awarded to one or two students early this March.  The John M. Parker III Field Camp Scholarship Fund is a student initiated scholarship honoring Dr. Parker.  Dr. Parker taught a variety of geology courses at NCSU and emphasized "hard rock" petrology and structural geology.  He is well known for his field mapping in the Piedmont.  Continued contributions by geology alumni, faculty, and friends have now raised the trust fund to a level where its interest will completely cover the tuition and course fee for at least one, and possibly two applicants.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence, this year, the awardee(s) will receive a full Parker Field Camp Scholarship based on his/her transcript (it can be an "unofficial" one printed off TRACS) and a brief (max. 1 page) explanation of why he/she should be the recipient of this award.  The explanation should illustrate why field camp is important to the applicant's career goals and anything else that would indicate the applicant deserves/needs the scholarship.  The recipient will also be honored at graduation.  To apply, please place submissions in Dr. Kimberley's mailbox in Jordan Hall no later than <I>5pm on Monday, March 4</I>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I encourage anyone planning to attend field camp to apply.  Do not assume who will or will not be chosen.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The applications will be reviewed by a committee consisting of two faculty members and two students.  A decision will be announced in mid March.  Any questions may be addressed to me through email.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck with your applications!

<font face=Helvetica>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Greetings everyone! We're into the Spring semester of 2002!  So far this year, we have been very informal.  We have had no dues, so no paid membership.  Basically, if you've shown any interest in the Geology Club or even if someone else <I>thinks</I> you might want to be on the mailing list, you've been listed as a "Member"!  Meetings are scheduled only a few days in advance.  The meeting schedule can be found on the <a href="http://www2.ncsu.edu/eos/service/pams/meas/geology_club/minutes.html"> Club Schedule</a>.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Please excuse the present look of the Geology Club Web Page.  The previous administrator did a wonderful job, but ran out of time to work on it after November 1, 2000!  Right now, I am slowly updating parts such as the club membership, etc.  Most of the material from TWO administrators ago is also preserved, but presently not linked.  Please be patient.  As of now, about half of the "membership" is listed in the <A HREF="../geology_club/forum.html"> Members</a> page.  All suggestions are welcome!

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Brand new news!  We now have a <A HREF="http://courses.forum.ncsu.edu/cgi-bin/netforum/geologyclub/a/1">Geology Club WebForum </A>.  It has just been set up.  It is the type of student forum where anyone can access it.  I don't think that will be a problem, but if it is, we'll deal with that later.  My experience is that the WebForum is an underused resource.  Please try it out.  Either reply to one of the topics I started, or start a new topic.  I think it could work well for us.

<blockquote><font color="black"><font size=+1>Greetings everyone! Fall is here and it is once again time for Geology Club meetings to start. Here are the vitals about the club. Our meeting room is in Jordan Hall room 2106. Meetings will be held every second and fourth Monday of each month from 6:30-7:30 although sometimes meetings will run longer. Our next meeting will be Oct. 9th. A more complete schedule can be found on the <a href="http://www2.ncsu.edu/eos/service/pams/meas/geology_club/minutes.html"> Club Schedule</a>.</font></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="black"><font size=+1> Dues are still $5.00. This covers the expense of refreshments, speakers, and the general running of the club. We also have T-shirts from previous years available. In additon. with the funds we have we hope to go on at least one field trip. Hopefully, all our old members as well as some new ones will be able to come this year. And remember, you don't have to be a geology major to join.</font></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font color="black"><font size=+1>I would like to ask everyone to please excuse the geology club webpage. I am in the middle of giving it a totally new look. Therefore, links and pictures will not work, or if they work they will link to pages of the old design or with outdated information. I am working on getting these fixed. However, I am particularly busy this semester, and work is going much slower than I planned. Hopefully, the new look will make the page appear more professional since not only students, but professors, graduates, and AIME/SME members will be looking at it. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions on how to make this a better page do not hesitate to email <a href="mailto:tsaiko1@hotmail.com">Susan Gidley</a>. (Actually, Susan Gidley left.  Please email <a href="mailto:rfmelvin@eos.ncsu.edu">Bob Melvin</a>) </font face></font></font></blockquote>
