Bartolomiej,

There is no problem with the "reliable_computing" list: We have implemented
a new way of removing incorrect addresses corresponding to servers
that give "non-standard" information that crashes the list server.

The reason your message wasn't sent was because you were sending
it from an address you had not used with the list before, and 
I must explicitly "approve" non-member submissions.  This takes
time, as I also have other interests and duties :-) In the past,
my policy was to routinely add addresses corresponding to people
I know are legitimate to the list, and I just did that with your
new address.  I recently have been hesitant to do that, since I got
a complaint from a person whose address I added (who subsequently
was receiving traffic from the list twice).   Nonetheless, I think
adding people to the list (and removing them if they complain) is the
lesser of two evils, so I will continue to do that.  That way, I'll
be sure people whom I know should be on the list actually are, and their
posting will go through immediately.

Sincerely,

R. Baker Kearfott
