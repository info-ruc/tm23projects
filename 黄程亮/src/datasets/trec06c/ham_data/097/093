Hello!

My time-out on the third line of item line +001 is not working for me. =
Rather than waiting 150 ticks, it is quickly goes to the next line.

+001 <t 150> <umpr> <mpr "+m"> <ln -5> c*"Victor le mange pendant la =
soir=E9e ", <ln 5> c*" Victor le mange pendant la soir=E9e";

I've posted the entire file below, in case the problem is somewhere =
other than in the item line. Also, my <fd> counts work fine, so it is =
only when I switch to a time-out <t> that I have a problem. I also know =
that the problem isn't that the number of ticks isn't enough because my =
<fd 30> holds the item longer than the <t 150>.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Tyler
