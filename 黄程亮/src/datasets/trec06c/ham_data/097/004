   You buy a PCMCIA PIO adapter and plug your button box into that.  But 
each button box is fabricated to work with some specific type of PIO card 
and the chances of someone non-technical getting that to work are roughly 
zero.  Unless you are super attached to millisecond accurate RTs I suggest 
getting some USB device that you like, be it a gamepad or a mouse or 
something else, and using that instead.  If you really have to have RTs 
with errors less than the 5-10ms or so that prevalent USB devices tend to 
have then you'll have to get a technician to set it up for you.  If you 
have money I can build or modify any existing button boxes for you but 
that's discussed off list.
