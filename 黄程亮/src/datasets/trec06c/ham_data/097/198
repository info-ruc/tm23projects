    My guess is that Microsoft's GDI+ patch has broken NVIDIA's and 
possibly other manufacturer's drivers -- at least busted one of the 
features that DMDX uses.  Until I get the thing under a microscope here 
your best bet is to use the DMDX for bad video cards shortcut or possibly 
the DMDX for GeForce video cards shortcut.  You could apply SP2 to the XP 
machine with the problem as I've yet to actually reproduce the failure here 
and all the machines here are SP2.

   It's not.

   The web tosses up this one:

When running an application a message box pops up containing the error message:

     Run-time error '-2147024882 (8007000e)'
     System Error &H80004005 (-2147467259). Unspecified error.

Meaning:

This error is a VB/VBA automation error. Details on how to interpret this 
and similar errors can be found at: 
http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q186/0/63.ASP.

Specifically this error means 'Out of memory'.
Possible Cause and Remedy:

This error has been encountered when an application was attempting to write 
to the NT/W2K event log but the NT/W2K event log was full. The event log 
was set to 'Override events older than NN days' (and there was no system 
message indicating that it was full). Changing this to 'Overwrite Events as 
Needed' removed the error.
