Hi, 

For some completely unknown reason, DMDX on my computer stopped being able
to display bmp's or JPG's this morning (where they are supposed to be shown,
theres a black screen, no error reported).  Everything else works perfectly
(video's still work, text is still displayed).  The problem started when my
experiment started only showing 1/2 of the pictures I asked it to show.  I
thought it was an error in my script, but past expt's that I have run
without a hitch also didn't work.  After updating my version of DMDX to the
latest version, now all of bmps and jpgs that I try to display simply do not
get shown. I've tried using all of the options such as "DMDX for really bad
graphics cards", changing graphics resolutions, resetting, vigorously
shaking the comp, etc, but nothing so far has worked (will give the shacking
bit another try shortly).  Any suggestions would be most helpful! My
suspicion at the mo is a faulty graphics card, or some weird interaction
with the card and the headmounted display + monitor I'm running from it
(although this combination has been working perfectly for a while now). 

Cheers, Andy.
