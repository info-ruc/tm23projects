Hi,

Amnesty International is holding an event this
saturday night at the Intercultural Resource Center, and with their
cosponsorship, on behalf of Yury Bandazhevsky, a prisoner of
conscience in Belarus.
Dr. Bandazhevsky devoted most of his working life to investigating
the effects of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor explosion upon
the people of southern Belarus. A respected medical academic, his
research led him to conclusions critical of the response of the
Belarussian government to the disaster. The administration
responded by arresting him in 1999. He was charged with crimes
under "anti-terrorism" legislation. In 2001 he was released from
prison pending trial but was returned to prison after a court
convicted him of accepting bribes from students seeking admission
to the Gomel Medical Institute, of which he is the founder and
rector. The evidence supporting his conviction was based on the
testimony of one person, who herself admitted accepting bribes from
students.

This event will be a party to raise money for postage for letters we
are sending to President Lukashenka of Belarus on Dr. Bandazhevksy's
behalf. We would like to involve as many like-minded organizations
as possible in our efforts to help him. In terms of cosponsorship,
we don't request any financial support, due to the genorosity of
the IRC in hosting the event. We would love, however, to have as
many members from your organization as possible attend. It would be
very helpful if you could forward an announcement about the event to
your  listerv, which I've appended below. We will continue working
on Dr. Bandazhevsky's case throughout the year. If this is
something you think your group would be interested in getting
involved with, please let me know. It would be a great opportunity
for us to combine our strengths for a common cause.

best,
Azatuhi Ayrikyan
