Hi Everyone,

I'm having problems tring to make Dmdx run short wav files of about 0.5 
sec. This is a continuum for a categorization test so the shortest files 
are of 0.51 sec and the longest are of... say 0.60 sec. The wav files have 
sample frequencies of 22050 Hz, and are instances of the word "step", this 
implies that after a periodic sound (the vowel) there is some silence and 
the a burst of energy (the 'p').
Now the two shortest ones have a strange behaviour: the 'p' or its last 
part is repeated.

I had set the item file for continous run, whit a fd of 115 ticks (on my 
notebook 16.674 ms) and a delay between items of 90 thicks. More over a 
text frame starts at the same time of the audio frame.

the following is one of my item lines:

+2 <wav 2> <emit "id steppe"><svp start>%0 "cepe_2" /*"2"/;

Does anyone ever knon of a promblem like this?



Thank you in advance for answers suggestions or ohter.

Leonardo
