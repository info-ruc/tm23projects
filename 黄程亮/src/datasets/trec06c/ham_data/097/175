Hi,

the <oversise 15,15,15,15> command (without DMDX for really bad video cards) did
the trick too. I should have tried using the larger values before.

I saw in the documentation that Arial is a good font to use--what would the
recommended font size be? I'm using Times New Roman 12 at the moment.



Thanks again,


Carrie
