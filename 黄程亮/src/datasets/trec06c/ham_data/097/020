Dear Friends, 

I have just learned that the deadline for submitting a paper to the 2005 IEEE 
International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE 2005) has been extended to 
November 15. This conference will take place May 22-25, 2005, in Reno,
Nevada.

 As you may remember, the conference organizers approved a special interval 
session at this conference. 
 
 All the papers have to be submitted through the conference webpage. When 
submitting, please follow the instructions send by the organizers:
 
IMPORTANT: The authors of the papers intended for the interval session
must specify the following topic:

    S1. Relation between fuzzy and interval techniques

as the first and only research topic on the online submission form.

Additional information on the conference can be obtained at the conference web
site:

    http://www.fuzzieee2005.org/
    
I hope to see many of you in Reno.

Vladik
