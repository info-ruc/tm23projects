Hi Jonathon,
    I've tested approximately 75 subjects on a Windows 2000 machine 
using the same DMDX program, and things have worked just fine--until 
this morning.  The syntax check didn't output any errors, but when I ran 
the script, the following message appeared: "Create memory-120x-17 
surface for qptr failed.  Unknown directdraw error (8007000e{14}).  
    I found the message copied below in the list archives, but I'm not 
sure if it's relevant since the error message is different and my 
program has worked fine until now.  Since multiple people use the 
machine, I'm in the process of trying to determine if anything was 
downloaded that may be corrupting DMDX.  In the mean time, do you have 
any suggestions for what the source of the error might be?  
Thanks,
Scott

   Hmm, could be DirectX 9 but seeing as you probably can't get rid of it 
you'll have to try some newer video drivers.  If you're using the most 
recent ones then you can try some different color depths, either 8 bit (not 
recommended but you may have no choice) or 24 or 32 bit.  If you have 
another video card perhaps you can try that.  OTOH perhaps this is another 
manifestation of whatever instability it is that VC 6 has introduced into 
DMDX and if nothing else alters the behavior you'll have to wait till I can 
figure out what's wrong -- I suspect I have located the basic region of the 
failure, it appears to be the RTF parser.
