Dear colleagues,

a new version of the CoStLy library for complex inclusion functions is
available now.

The whole library has been redesigned completely. All of the "usual"
standard functions have now (almost) optimal accuracy.  There are new
power functions with (almost) optimal accuracy and new root functions
with (almost) optimal accuracy.

The code and a preprint are available at

http://iamlasun8.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ae16/CoStLy.html


The ACETAF package is also affected. The new version 3.0 uses the CoStLy 
inclusion functions, which are more accurate than the previous 
implementations in ACETAF (but the "true" ACETAF procedures are 
unchanged). ACETAF is available at

http://iamlasun8.mathematik.uni-karlsruhe.de/~ae16/acetaf.html


Best regards,

Markus
