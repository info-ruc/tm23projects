  Hmm, I would have thought something like <oversise 15,15,15,15> would 
have been sufficient.  Not that using that shortcut will necessarily hurt 
anything, it will make extended tachistoscopically short displays more 
prone to errors but if you don't see errors in your AZK files you're 
probably fine using that shortcut.
