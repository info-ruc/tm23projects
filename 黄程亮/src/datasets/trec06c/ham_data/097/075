To the Williams Community,

I am writing to update you on the matter of the discrimination grievance 
proceedings that I spoke about at the Faculty Meeting in September.  The 
faculty members involved -- Professor Laylah Ali and Professor Aida Laleian 
-- have come to an early agreement.  The process that led to this agreement 
was initiated by Professor Ali and accepted by Professor Laleian.

I have been asked by both faculty members to make public the apologies of 
Professor Laleian.  Her two letters -- to Professor Ali and to the college 
community -- are printed here below, in full.

--------------------------------------------------

Dear Professor Ali:

In the studio honors meeting held on May 17, I conducted myself toward you 
in  a manner which was unconscionable.  I used racially charged language 
that was enormously hurtful.  What I did was profoundly wrong and was 
completely unprovoked.  Your statements were reasonable and professional, 
and I responded in a manner that was unreasonable, angry, emotional, and 
deeply offensive.

There is no excuse for that sort of expression in any discourse, and 
certainly not in the context of an academic institution.  As a result of my 
behavior, the atmosphere in the room became so offensive that you were 
essentially forced to leave the room.  As a result, you were excluded from 
participation in an important aspect of your work within the 
department.  In this you were doubly wronged, first by the hurt that I 
caused, and secondly by your being prevented from taking part in 
departmental discussion and decisions.  I accept responsibility for 
creating a climate in that room most inhospitable to you as a colleague:  a 
climate that interfered even with your ability to do your job.

Both for the pain which I caused and for the manner in which I have 
compromised your ability to effectively work within the department, I have 
the deepest regrets.  I want to offer to you a sincere apology for this.

Sincerely,

Aida Laleian

  --------------------------------------------------

To the College Community,

I have not addressed the Williams community before this because I was asked 
to maintain confidentiality, but also because I remain deeply ashamed of my 
words and behavior.  I am immensely grieved to recognize that the hurt, 
which I caused, is now felt by the whole of the community.  Continuing to 
this day, I feel terribly saddened and enormously sorry for having caused 
this harm to Professor Ali, to the other members of my department, and to 
the college as a whole.  I want to make my most sincere, heartfelt apology 
to all.

Sincerely,

Aida Laleian

--------------------------------------------------

In response to Professor Laleian's apology, Professor Ali has asked that 
the following statement also be released:

My reason for pursuing the discrimination grievance procedure was to see 
that the gravity of the incident was recognized by the person 
responsible.  I felt that it would only be possible for us to work together 
in the future if Professor Laleian took responsibility for her actions at 
our May meeting.  She has made a statement of apology that offers a sense 
of the fundamental breach that occurred at our meeting, and I accept that 
apology.  By her acknowledgement of the seriousness of what happened, we 
can begin to move on, and I hope that some trust can be rebuilt over time.

--------------------------------------------------

At this point, Professors Ali and Laleian have agreed to bring this matter 
to a close.  I am hopeful that this agreement will allow the community to 
move forward.

Sincerely,

William J. Lenhart
Dean of the Faculty
