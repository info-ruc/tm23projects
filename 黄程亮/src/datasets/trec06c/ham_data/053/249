Hi all!
    I recently got hold of a sharp GP2D12 ir range sensor (The analog
version, not 8-bit serial) Upon connecting it to my handyboard (Vcc-5v,
Gnd-Gnd, and Vo to analog port) I get between 249 and about 251 value from
the analog port. Clearly no good. Am I doing something wrong? I know the HB
has a 47k pullup, is this messing with things? Anybody had the same problem
and sorted it?
Matt

P.s I've had the same problem with both of my 'D12 sensors.
