There's no reason there should be a problem with this.  The HB interface uses 
fully standard serial comms protocols.

All you have to do is get the right cable to connect the HB interface to your 
SGI.  The HB interface acts like a modem with a DB-25 female connector (as do 
many modems).

So get whatever cable you would use to connect such a modem to your SGI and 
you'll be in business.  One end would be a DB-25 male and the other end goes 
into the SGI.
