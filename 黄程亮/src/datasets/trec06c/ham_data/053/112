Dear all,

I am hoping to use DMASTR to control ERP and EEG experiments using a
Neuroscan setup with synamps, and hope to find others who are doing the same.

First off, I need to get the stimulus computer connected to the EEG
computer.  I checked into the PIO12 i/o card from Keithley... It seems that
Computerboards makes an identical unit (called the CIO DIO 24).  Has anyone
used the Computerboards card for such a purpose?  

If anyone has any helpful hints about setting this up I would be most
appreciative.

with best regards,

John Kline
