i have used a few PICs, but they have to be programmed in assembly 
language. but just recently i have found a compiler called C2C which 
converts C code into assembly code. C2C provides assembly code for 
PICs from Microchip and Scenic. there is a freeware version to 
download at

i havent used it yet but would be interested if you get any progress.

cheers
