you won't be able to easily) get distance measures with standard IR comms
parts (such as the IS1u60).  light travels too fast for the time delay
betw xmit and rcv to tell you anything.

as a proximity sensor, all you get is a yes/no reading.  if you have a
well-aimed part, you might be able to use a pair to detect close/far.

for distance, use a specialized distance sensor like the sharp
GP2d02.  info is at www.acroname.com.
