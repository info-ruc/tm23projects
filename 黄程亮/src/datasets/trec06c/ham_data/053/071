Hi,
I'm assembling a handyboard and am at the stage where the digital inputs
are tested using the testdigitals() function of hbtest.c. The test
partially works, and I get the beeps after pressing the start and stop
buttons, but when I jumper the digital inputs at J2, the zeros never
change to ones for any of the inputs. I'd  appreciate your suggestions.
Thanks,

Umar
