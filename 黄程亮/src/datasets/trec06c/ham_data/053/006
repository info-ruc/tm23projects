Subject: Using 12V supply with Exp Board (2nd posting)
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi all,
 
This is a second posting of the question I posted up several days ago. So I
apologize in advance for any inconvenience if you've already got my first
posting.

Anyways, I am currently using the 9.6V supply voltage on the HB and hoping
to step up the supply to 12V. The problem is that since the Expansion Board
share the same power supply at the J6 junction it means that the 6V supply
connected to the diode labelled D5 (Please see expansion board electrical
schematic for detail at
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/hbexp30/expsch30
.gif) will also be increased to 9V, am I right? If this is the case, then
what is the 6 V supply for? Is it safe to assume that whatever is using
will be able to handle the increase voltage as well?  Also, since the
collector input of Q2 (3906 transistor for LEGO sensor) also share the J6
header, will the LEGO sensor circuit be able to handle the increased
voltage too? I'd be very grateful if someone can help me answer these
questions. Thanks.
