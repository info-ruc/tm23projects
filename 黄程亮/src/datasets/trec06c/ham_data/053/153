Kent:

I'm not at work, so I don't have access to some catalogs there... but have
you looked at W.M. Berg, PIC, Sterling Drive Components, etc??? I think they
are all located in Connecticut, USA.  hey specialize in very small precision
gears and drive components.  You  will probobly have to bore the I.D.
yourself, as your specs are a little off the nominal inch standards.

Give me a buzz personally if you want more info on the  above.

HTH, Jeff
