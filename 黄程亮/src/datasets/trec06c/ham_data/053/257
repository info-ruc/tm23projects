Hi , I am a handyboard user and I am trying to build a tele-robot.

I am using the transmitter and receiver from Glolab.

I have fix up a pair of transceiver namely "A" and "B" (with TM1V and =
RM1V) as guided in "How Encoders and Decoders work" using HT-680 and =
HT-694.

Transceiver "A" is connected to my host computer and transceiver "B" is =
connected to my handyboard.

Each transceiver has their common ground and +V5.  These transceivers =
work well in half-duplex mode.  I fixed a LED to the VT port of HT-694 =
and the LED light-up whenever valid data is being received.
=20
But I can't operate these transceiver in full duplex mode.  Whenever the =
transceiver "A" is busy receiving data, it just can't transmit out any =
signal.  When the receiving LED "A" (VT) is light-up, and when I tried =
to pull the TE of the transmitter "A" to ON (+5V sharing power source =
for both TM1V and RM1V), the receiving LED turn off and the other =
transceiver  "B" didn't receiving any signal as the led "B" didn't =
light-up.

I tried to solve this problem to have two antennas for transmitter and =
receiver but end up with the same result.

I tried to separate the +5V power source for the transmitter and =
receiver but this doesn't solve my problem.  It is not possible for me =
to separate the common ground (if this is the solution) as I need to =
connect all of the signal to one parallel port from my host computer =
with one common ground.

Please advise on the above matter.

Thank You.

Regards,
William
