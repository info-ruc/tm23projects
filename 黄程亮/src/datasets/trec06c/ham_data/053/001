Dear Paul,

I have an H-bridge that I designed to run big motors.  It runs at two
amps continuous, and three amps intermittantly.  It uses 5 volts for
logic from your Handyboard, and 12 volts from a gel cell to run the
motors.  It also has an analog feedback signal proportional to motor
current that you can read from the Handyboard.  You use it by removing
one of the L293D chips from your board, and plugging into the socket.  I
use an Allegro dual H-bridge.

I have circuit boards made up for the bridge, and most of the
components.  I would need to order a couple items to build you a board,
and I would need about two weeks to have one ready.  I'd also need to
write up some interfacing instructions for you, but there wouldn't be
much to that.  I designed the prototype using a Handyboard to run it.

The board was designed to sell commercially, but I haven't quite
completed the overall package it is to go with.  Check out
http://www.lightwaverobotics.com to see what I'm up to.

If you want a board complete as above, it's $100.  In another week or
so, I can take credit cards, or you can mail in a check.

You can do better!  There are other sources that will come in somewhat
less expensive.  However, mine is made for you specifically, and is not
a general design with little interfacing support.

If you object to this solicitation, I don't mind.  In fact, I'll send
you the design for free just for having irritated you, and you can make
your own by hand.

Best Regards,

Gary Livick
