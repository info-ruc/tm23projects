Eureka! <mip 27> did the trick for recording Bit4! Thanks tremendously.

Now I have another challenge. I'm displaying a series of images (.bmp),
each of which is followed by a prompt (also .bmp) for a response. My
timing is 500 msec for the image, 2500 msec for the response prompt, and
this sequence is repeated several times. I have coded <rcot> to get a
timed recording of when my images appear. I would also like to have a
timed recording of when they go off screen. To clarify, I need this for
the 500 msec. image, not the prompt that follows. Here's a sample of my
code for two images, each followed by a prompt.

=1101 <fd 30> *g"e:\Iaps\1101.bmp"/, <fd 150> g"e:\Iaps\PUN.bmp"/;
=1102 <fd 30> *g"e:\Iaps\1102.bmp"/, <fd 150> g"e:\Iaps\PUN.bmp"/;

Suggestions? I'm running this on Monday, and speed is of the essence.

Many thanks,

Clay
