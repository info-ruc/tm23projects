  www.yahoo.com, search for "H Bridge", trust me, lots of hits will comeup.
Look for the 4QD pages, they talk a lot about H Bridge designs.  If you 
aren't comfortable with electronic design, don't bother though... 

>The same goes for the LMD18200, I understand that is not compatible with

  This IS an H Bridge.  Its a 3Amp one.  Go to the National Sem. site and
get the databook pages for it, there are circuit design suggestions in 
there that are quite detailed.

  As opposed to a large circuit? 8-()  If you don't feel comfortable with 
designing your own circuits, check out http://www.hvwtech.com and look at
their L298 driver board, its about US$15 and has all of the parts, put it 
together and connect it up.  I have two of their boards, very nice.

  Actually, this is a fairly easy way to make a space heater, is there some 
other reason you want to do this?  If you want to use this as a motor speed 
control, its a very bad (wasteful) idea.  PWM is what you want, the H-Bridge 
type controllers just love to use PWM to handle this.

have fun,
