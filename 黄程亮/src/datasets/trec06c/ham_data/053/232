hello all,
quick question- inside the Handy Board Tech. Ref. we
saw two IR sensors mentioned (Quality Tech. QRD 1114 &
QRB 1114).  we are wondering if anyone has used these
sensors and knows how to obtain them?  we have
contacted our HB vendor, but they had no information
for us.

Thanks for the help!!!!
