Since the analog inputs read voltage levels, you should be able to just plug
in any switch or 5-0volt input directly.  To read the values, use the analog
command, and in theory you should only get two possible values, 255 for
+5volts, and 0 for 0 volts.  Depending on if your inputs are driven logic
versus switches, you may need to threshold these values and consider
anything above maybe 200 to be a logic high and anything below 50 to be a
logic low.  But if you are using precisely 5 volts and 0 volts, or an open
and closed switch, than the extreme values should be accurate.
