Here is a summary of activities from the Thu, Sep 23, 99 Graduate Student
Organization meeting.  It only includes the portion of the meeting in which
we described the committees, officers and dept representative positions we
are trying to fill.

Please take a look at each committee or position.  Each lists an e-mail
contact if you are interested.  Those committees marked as (new) are
brand-new this year and are mandated by our draft constitution (mail
steering@gso.bu.edu for information or comments on the constitution).

Our next general meeting will be in October (to be announced).  We will
attempt to finalize membership in committees, officer positions, and
dept reps at that time.
