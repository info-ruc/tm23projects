Interactive C can't handle 2D or 3D arrays.... instead another method needs
to be used..

If your matrix was a 3X3

789
456
123

and rows went from bottom to top and columns from left to right

then you'd have to come up with a formula using the row and column numbers
to access each cell

for example in this configuration you can access any of the cells using the
formula

let the row# = j
let the col# = i

total number of rows = J
total number of cols = I

cell# = (j-1)*J+i

or if the matrix is like so

369
258
147

cell# = (i-1)*I+j

I've never tried for a 3D array but assuming that there was a layer on top
of the second matrix shown, with the same pattern...

depth# = k
total depths = K

cell# = (i-1)*I+j+(I*J)*(k-1)

Hope that helps if you can follow the variables....

.I need to transfer the data in a matrix on the HB to my win98 PC?  I know a
.special program is necessary to interpret the signals going to the
.COM port.
.Does anyone have such a program or have the have some code that I
.can compile
.with VS 6.0?  Here is the function I am using:
.
.
.int map[15][15][5];
.void output()
.	{
.
.		int v=0;
.		int h=0;
.		int o=0;
.		for(v = 0; v<15; v++) {
.			for(h=0; h<15; h++) {
.				for(o=0; o<5; o++){
.		                      serial_putchar(map[v][h][o]);
.				}
.			}
.		}
.	}
.
