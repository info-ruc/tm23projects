I every one, I have a problem, is it possible to have an extension board
connected to the HB, and at the same time have a seperate motor power
source?

The reason I'm asking this is because that the "seperate motor power
source" and "extension board" would have to share the same motor power
header.

And another problem that would arise is that if I cut the motor power
trace, would the extension board still work????

Thanks,
