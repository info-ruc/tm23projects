Subject: Lo-Tech for Hi-Tech swaps, anyone? 

I plan to use the Handyboard within a Course on Interfacing, Microcontroller
and Assembly Language Programming at undergraduate level here, starting next
month. It turns out that there is a PCB production facility here in Zimbabwe
which is now manufacturing the Handyboard PCB for me quite nicely at
relatively low cost. But the parts (eg plcc sockets, 74HC family etc) are
relatively expensive here.

So here is my question.

Is there anybody out there who would like some low-cost Handyboard PCBs for
your students to mess up? I would like to swap bare, unfilled Handyboards
for parts, like 68HC11E1, caps, LEDs, anything on the list, new or used.
Just put them into a small Jiffey bag with a Green Customs Sticker marked
"Gift: value US$1" (very very important) and send to address below. Anything
you send will be used by my students, who would otherwise have to buy parts
locally for their practical work. Please include your name and mail address,
and say whether you want some Handyboard PCBs in return, or would rather
swap for African exotica. I do a rather nice line in African stone carvings,
Witchdoctor impedimenta, also local newspapers and books, ANYTHING (well,
almost.......)
