This is a classic application for what is called an Instrumentation
Amplifier.  An IA functions just like an ordinary Op-Amp, however it
typically offers close-to-rail-to-rail outputs and at least a very high
input impedance.

One would then use this amplifier as a preamp in your circuit.  Since you
intend on using a Handyboard, I would suggest a single supply IA.

Here is Analog Device's IA selection tree.

Here's a selector guide from Maxim.

Here's yet another from National Semiconductor

Intersil (formerly Harris Semiconductor) has a limited selection that
can be found here:

You would have to be more specific with your application for a less
ambiguous response.  Information you might find yourself needing would
include the output drive capability of your device under test, and the
maximum frequency content of the signal you are measuring.
