Hello,

i have the same problem with the Error at address 0x0000.

First i checked the hardware (Ram,Latch...) but i cant't find a bug.

In the archive i found this message that descibe a softwarebug on faster 
machines. 
But i tested HBDL with a P133 and P60. With the same wrong result :-(

I think this machines are slow enough ;-)

Has anybody some other ideas what's happen?

sincerely
Mike Schubert
