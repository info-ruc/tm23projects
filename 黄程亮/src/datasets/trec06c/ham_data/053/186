  You must still have a D parameter as the ISI is not guarenteed to be
anything other than longer than 48 ticks, just how much longer depends on
how much work DMDX must do to prepare the item.  You should determine what
delay you want between items and specify that as the value for the D
parameter.  And don't pick some really small value either, make it some
reasonable value like 48 ticks.
