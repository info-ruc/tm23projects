In case this talk of DMDX timing errors unsettles anyone, let me reassure
those who have not tried it for themselves -- DMDX is very accurate.

I just ran a test on one of our lab machines (nothing running in the
background except net traffic).

I looked up the refresh time: 13.7 ms (72 hz).
Then I prepared the following item:

	0 %300 "Begin timer......."/ %4320 "NOW"/ %72 "STOP!!!";

4320 ticks = 72 x 60, so this should give 60 secs as the interval between
the second and third frames.

I ran this 4 times, and got the following values (using my Ultimate Sports
Alarm Chrono stopwatch made in China, retail: free with a subscription to
TIME):  59.13, 59.38, 59.34, 59.47.

Hmmm.  Average = 59.33.  Not quite 60.00, but not too bad.

And then I remembered I was using the Primary display for timing, not the
secondary display.  So I checked the refresh time for the primary display
using TimeDX.  

The correct refresh time was 13.734 ms.  

Guess what (4320 x 13.734)/1000 equals?  Right -- 59.33!

So the point is that if you ask DMDX to control the time, it will.  If you
are interested in the time it takes to complete a whole series of items,
then you need to specify the exact inter-item interval using the d
parameter, as Jonathan indicated.
