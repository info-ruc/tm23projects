  For those of you concerned about display errors and that are running '98
there is an interesting utility available:

  http://www.98lite.net/

  It's been available for a while but has required a deal of skill on the
part of the person installing it, it now has a reasonably friendly
installer.  What can do (amongst other things) is remove the Internet
Explorer from the machine, a large program that is likely to be consuming
cpu cyles that DMDX could use to prevent display errors, it certainly
consumes memory resources that DMDX can use for more intensive item files
using large amounts of sound or AVIs and so forth.  The registered pro
version includes an interesting option, 98micro, which I haven't tested (I
don't have the pro version) but stands to yeild even greater benefit -- put
it this way, if his benchmarks show a 5% increase in frame rate for Quake
then that applies to DMDX as it's displaying frames, the additional 5%
increase for the business apps is more liklely to be an ISI improvement for
DMDX as it prepares materials for display.
