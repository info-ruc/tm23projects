Jim -

This is only tangentially related to your question, but
I have an article from the January 1987 'IBM J. Res. Develop.'
(vol. 31, n1, pp73-80) written by Mike Cowlishaw and
discussing the LEXX text editor. IBM has an R&D group at
Hursley, UK, and Cowlishaw is kind of their equivalent to
Rob Pike. Except of course IBM can never follow through
commercially on his creations.

Anyhow, Cowlishaw writes that 'the editor was originally
developed as a tool for lexicographers during the author's
secondment to the New Oxford English Dictionary project at
Oxford University Press and uses that project in the
examples.

The screen shot figures in my copy are illegible, but if
you're interested you might go to the Stanford CS library
and look up the original.  A version of LEXX called LPEX
is included in some of IBMs OS/2 products, so of course
I've never seen it.  But from reading the article (which
came out about the same time the original SAM article did)
it sounded like it had some interesting features, esp. for
<SGML> tagged (or any structured) data.
