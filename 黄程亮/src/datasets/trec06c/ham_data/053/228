  I'm trying to set up either one or preferably two near infra red proximity
detectors. I'm wondering whether the sharp IS1U60L component mounted on the
handy-board is suitable for this type of application.
  We managed to make it work recieving codes from a sony remote, but are having
problems using LED's to  emit a signal. As far as I know, I have to emit a
short pulse, and then wait until the detector registers a return signal and the
time difference will be proportional to the distance.
  Software drivers/locations and hardware details suitable for this application
would be much appreciated.

  Thank you in advance,
      Andrew Walker
