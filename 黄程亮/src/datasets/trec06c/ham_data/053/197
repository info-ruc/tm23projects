namespace is the best.  you can say file name space if you want but
I would prefer namespace.

This is just concerned with terminology of a concept in Plan 9.

In the papers where "file hierarchy" are concerned, the term "file name space"
is used.  On the other hand, Programmer's Manual Volume 1 says
namespace(4) and namespace(6).  Can I use those words with the same
meaning?
