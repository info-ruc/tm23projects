I'm afraid that I'm not qualified to recommend any PICs, but I do know about programming.  Basic can be used to implement fairly complex algorithms, but it's not easy to use it for the really tricky data structures, and it would be almost impossible to do object oriented programming (OOP) in Basic (i.e., encapsulation, inheritance & polymorphism, etc.).

C is not a very good language for OOP, either, although it is quite a lot more powerful and expressive than Basic.  There's really nothing that can't be done with C, if you have plenty of time to chase down bugs =%o  The HB is really ideal for science projects -- if you can afford it.

I have heard of new micro-controller processors with Java interpreters on board.  Java is about the easiest OOP language there is and also very powerful.  I don't know how much the new Java micro-controllers cost, or if they're even available yet.  You could check out Sun's Java page (www.javasoft.com) for more info.  Best of luck!
