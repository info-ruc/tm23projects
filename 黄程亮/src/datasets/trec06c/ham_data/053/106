Professor Robson:
    I am an Electrical engineering student at Oregon State University.  I am
really interested in trading you for your stone carving (My wife is an Art
major and collector), but I don't just want to send off a bag of misc. parts
that you really don't need.  In a couple of days, let me know what exactly
you still need and how many and I am sure that we can easily work something
out.  I also have a friend going to your country to visit in a few weeks so
I probably could just send them with him (Could ship from there and save me
some of the shipping if the parts are small).  Best of luck teaching the
class.  I am working on setting a more basic one up myself (starts in two
weeks w/ some basic electronic theory and practice)
