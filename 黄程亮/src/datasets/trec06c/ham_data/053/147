I am having problems with programming the handyboard using Interactive C
3.2. When I used the function fd(n) to test for continuous motor rotation,
the board would crashed or it would only spin for a fraction of a second.
Also, even when I put it in an endless loop, it would only spin for a
fraction of a second. I know IC is not a traditional C compiler, so is
there something I am missing?
