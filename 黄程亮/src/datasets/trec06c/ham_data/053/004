This is somewhat off subject, but I am looking for a circuit schematic that
will show how to build a serial port optoisolator for my computer.  The
problem I am having is that once in a while I wire a circuit wrong and end
up putting 115V onto the ground pin on my serial port.  Obviously the
computer does not like this very much and I ended up frying an old
motherboard.  Anyway, I wanted to build a small box that contained a circuit
that I could use to completely isolate my circuits from the serial port, yet
still be able to transmit and receive data through the port.  If any of you
have seen such a schematic or pre-existing part I would be extremely
grateful.  Thanks

Bill Denzel
