Hello,

I have seen on the Newton Labs website that IC is available for SGI Unix. 
Unfortunately I cannot find any more documentation than that. Does anyone know 
whether IC will work on Irix 6.2? Also, how do you download P code to the 
board? I think the website said an automatic dowloader is only available for 
Windows and Macintosh. 

Also, does anyone know whether the Macintosh Handyboard interface from Gleason 
Reseach will work with the serial ports on an Indy?

Thanks very much,

Owain Roberts
