I forget the web page, but I did find a JAVA compiler for the HB online!  
It looks great!  I havent had a chance to experiment with it yet, but it 
uses much less memory then IC and appears to be very powerful, might want 
to look for that.

Basic can be used to implement fairly complex algorithms, but it's not easy to use it for the really tricky data structures, and it would be almost impossible to do object oriented programming (OOP) in Basic (i.e., encapsulation, inheritance & polymorphism, etc.).

I don't know how much the new Java micro-controllers cost, or if they're even available yet.  You could check out Sun's Java page (www.javasoft.com) for more info.  Best of luck!
