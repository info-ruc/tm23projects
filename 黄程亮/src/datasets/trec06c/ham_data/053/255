no doubt Micro Mo motors are sweet, but if the project is on a hobby
budget, also consider:

All Electronics
-An electronics surplus company with a decent selection of motors and lots
of other neat gadgets for robot building.  This will be among the cheapest
of your options.
www.allelectronics.com

Pittman
-Another manufacturer of high quality motors, not quite as expensive, but
still pricy.  They also have gearhead motors and motors with built in
encoders.  We've used Pittmans for some robot projects at CMU with
great success.  Extensive specs on the web at:
http://www.pittmannet.com/  

Grainger
-"distributor of maintenance, repair, and operating (MRO) supplies" has a
few pages of motors in their phonebook-sized catalog.  They have gear
motors starting at $20 or $30.
www.grainger.com

best of luck,
Michael
