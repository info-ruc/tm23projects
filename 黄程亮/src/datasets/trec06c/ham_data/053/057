Also, the "digital(int p)" extends to the analog ports too.  When used
with a port that is analog in hardware, it just uses 127 as a threshold
value to return 1 or 0 (note below 127 returns true).

See page 22 in the HB manual.

However, with this method, you lose the advantage of setting your own
thresholds which, as Will stated, may be important depending on your
application.
