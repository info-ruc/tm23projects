Measure the resistance of the motor's windings. Motors are typically rated
in max current, NOT max voltage. Take any voltage and divide it by the
winding resistance to get the current the motor will draw at stall (and
when it is initally starting) at that voltage). 

There is no way to "deduce" the maximum current a motor can sustain without
either getting the manufacturers specifications or by burning up a few.
