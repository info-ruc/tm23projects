Reasonable is a such a subjective term ;>)

You might look at http://www.clippard.com/.  They have a very broad 
assortment of small pneumatic stuff.  Internationally available

Parker http:/www.parker.com has all the big stuff you'll ever need... not 
necessarily cheap, but it depends what you need.  Actually, because most 
large (> 1.5" ) cylinders are made to N.F.P.A. standards, they are 
remarkably inexpensive, and lots of different companies make them.  Shop 
around....

Hi everyone!

can anyone recommend a place where i can get pneumatic and hydraulic
cylinders, and hopefully at reasonable prices?

my team and i are planning to build a robot making use of those cylinders.
has anyone done the same?  any advice would be appreciated!
