Has anyone else had similar inconsistencies with the timing of a program's
length?

I have a DMDX program which is coded, using <fd n>, to last 816 seconds.
The day before running a subject, I ran the program several times and it
timed out exactly at 816 sec., both according to my output file and a
stopwatch. The next day, nothing having been altered, it ran 820 seconds
(according to output file and stopwatch), both in practice and with my
subject. To further complicate the issue, it twice ran for 820 sec.
according to the output file, but 816 according to a stopwatch.

I've had no error messages or other problems in terms of my image loading
time, so the trouble doesn't lie there.

Suggestions?
