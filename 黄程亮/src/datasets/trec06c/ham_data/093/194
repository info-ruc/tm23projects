   DMDX will use up to 24 frame buffers if the video card has the 
memory 
for them, otherwise it uses as many as it can make.  Which means that 
with 
an older video card or a really big and deep video mode there may be 
fewer 
frame buffers than there are in an item file which means DMDX has to 
load 
frame buffers as the item is displaying.  On some hardware this is no 
big 
deal, on others it's problematic and it sounds like this is exactly 
the 
issue you are facing.  Sometimes this can be ameliorated by changing 
the 
Number of Lines to Blit in the Advanced Vertical Retrace Synch Test.
