Sorry, I should have explained our setup a bit better. At the moment, I'm running both DMDX and the eye tracker on the same computer, so both processes will be working off the same clock. This is why I thought using the system clock with a millisecond time-stamp may work. (I do realise that running both processes on the same machine will introduce some additional error, but this setup is due to funding constraints.)

However, if there was a way for DMDX to set a given memory location or interrupt, I could try to use that as the trigger for the eye tracking software. I'm reluctant to use a feedback loop from a PIO card, but if you think that's the only solution I'll attempt it.

Regards,
Ronan

   We usually synchronize machines in such circumstances with a signal from 
an interface card, can your eye tracker record another channel of data?  Or 
alternatively can be started by the signal from DMDX?  Barring that the 
time stamp of the file is all that exists right now and I doubt that giving 
you a millisecond accurate time stamp would help much as the probability of 
the two clocks being in synch to the millisecond is zero.  Even if you have 
them synched to an external time source both machines will drift almost 
immediately.   Which is which recording a signal from DMDX in the eye 
tracking data is the best solution.
