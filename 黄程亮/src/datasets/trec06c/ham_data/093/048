   It wouldn't be in the help if it hadn't been, believe me.  In any event 
you don't need it.  There's a keyword to determine a frame's duration with 
a counter and there's a random number function that can be used in an 
expression to set a counters value so you can make the last frame of all 
items a random duration.
