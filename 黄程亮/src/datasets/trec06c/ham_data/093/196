   Yeah, but that's not windows playing them, that's Quicktime and I'm not 
convinced QT actually uses windows functions to play files.

   But Windows Media Player won't play .MOVs so DMDX won't either.  Sounds 
like you've got a balky machine there if WM 9 was causing trouble and it's 
XP repair time (boot on XP CD, ENTER to setup windows, R to repair the 
installation it should find -- don't do it with the ethernet connected or 
you'll get blasted, once it's booted turn the IP firewall on then plug the 
ethernet in and run windows update).

   If you don't repair XP you need to spend time with the Refresh Test, 
maybe you need to turn off Read Between Flips to Stop Cheating Drivers too.

   It's possible that D3D acceleration does in fact need to be on.
