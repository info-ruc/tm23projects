The files don't actually have any video. They're just sound. I saw the
StreamingAudio keyword, and I'll give it a try.  Thanks for the response.

   You want to strip the video out?  You could try the <StreamingAudio>
keyword.  I've only tested it with pure audio files but it just might work
with audiovisual files and it sure ain't going to render the video.
