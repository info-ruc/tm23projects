Hello,

I finally got Digital Video to work with some kindly advice. I needed the Nimo
Codec Pack. I found it at http://nimo.titanesk.com/. I went with Build 8 (they
advise that only expert users dabble with the current beta version). I could
not get DMDX to play mov files, but authorware like QT Pro or Macromedia
Director will convert that format to mpg or avi.

If you are going to use the default movie given in the test, it also helps to
verify if it is actually on your machine in the named directory (only happened
on 1 machine out of 3, but I admit to being baffled for a time there...) ;}
