   Are you using the latest TimeDX?  I seem to recall some silly error eons 
ago to do with that code but it doesn't seem likely, I don't see a record 
of it in the source code anyway.  Maybe the codec didn't come with 
Quicktime, what happens when you double click on the file in the 
explorer?  If windows can play the file DMDX should be able to and if it 
can't maybe there's something I need to fix.  Perhaps if the files aren't 
massive you can send on to me (not the list).  If windows can't play it 
then you'll have to find a codec on the Apple site somewhere or find a way 
to convert the files to .MPEG or some other format.
