Hi all,

I am trying to run an experiment where the inter trial interval varies 
randomly between items, ranging from 500 - 1500 msecs.....

Is this possible in DMDX?  I have looked at the scrambling help pages etc 
and it doesn't seem that this can be done.

I know I can group items, or just include a blank frame at the end of an 
item but then that item will always preceed an interval of the same 
duration and ideally I want it to be completely random.

Thanks for your help,
Emma
