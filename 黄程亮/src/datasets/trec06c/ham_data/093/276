Hi Cammy et al.!

In response to your request for information on the British music=20
tradition on the Swedish west coast, I'm sending along a few extracts=20
from my Ph D application, where I outline the subject and describe the=20=

aspects that I'm particularly interested in. Any comments or questions=20=

are more than welcome!

Enjoy!

Kind regards,
Jonas

"I intend to undertake research on the influence of British and Irish=20
music on Swedish folk music from the latter half of the 17th century=20
until the present day. Examples of possible angles from which to=20
approach this research would be to investigate the connections and=20
kinship between different types of tunes (for example =93engelskor=94 =
and=20
British =93hornpipes=94, or the =93rill/rull/rell=94 in Sweden and =
Norway and=20
the =93reel=94 in Scotland and Ireland), or how recent folk music bands=20=

such as =93Atlantiska Orkestern=94 and =93Orust=94 are emphasizing the =
kinship=20
between the different traditions.

According to Magnus Gustavsson, a musicologist at =93Sm=E5lands =
Musikarkiv=94=20
(=93The Music Archive of Sm=E5land County=94), it appears that the =
influx of=20
music from the British Isles can be divided into three separate=20
periods. The first began during the second half of the 17th century,=20
when melodies of British origin began to appear in Nordic music books=20
in large numbers. The melodies often had clear parallels with=20
contemporary British collections, such as the highly popular =93The=20
English Dancing Master=94 (1651) by John Playford (1623-1686). One of =
the=20
most popular dances of British origin in Sweden during this period was=20=

the gigue, which exists today mainly in Scottish and Irish tradition,=20
under the name =93jig=94.

The second period of diffusion pointed out by Gustavsson was during the=20=

second half of the 18th century, when a number of stylized French=20
=93engelskdanser=94 (=3D=94dances in the English (i.e. British) style=94) =
became=20
popular in Sweden. One of the most prominent dances is called=20
=93kontradans=94 (=93contradance=94). The name is derived from the =
English term=20
=93Country Dance=94, and a significant feature of the dance is that it =
is=20
performed by several dancers standing in parallel lines or in different=20=

geometrical figures. It is still practised in Anglo-American=20
traditions, known as =93line dance=94 or =93square dance=94. Interest in =
the=20
=93kontradans=94 originally spread to the Nordic countries from France, =
but=20
of the melodies that have been written down only a few are of French=20
origin =96 the majority have clear parallels in the musical tradition of=20=

the British Isles.

The third period pointed out by Gustavsson was at the beginning of the=20=

19th century, when a large number of melodies appeared in Swedish=20
collections with parallels in the British reel tradition. The reel is=20
Scottish in origin, and during the second half of the 18th century it=20
began to spread to Ireland and other neighbouring areas. The presence=20
of melodies with a foundation in the reel tradition in Swedish music=20
books from the turn of the century, appears to indicate that this=20
repertoire also reached Sweden during that period or soon afterwards.

The reason why reels, jigs and other British/Irish dances did not=20
achieve any dominant position in the Nordic countries was that they had=20=

to compete with a strong and well-established =93polska=94 and =
=93springar=94=20
tradition. Nevertheless, a remnant of the Anglo-Saxon repertoire=20
survived and has been kept alive to this day, for example in the form=20
of =93engelskor=94 in Sweden and =93rilar=94 in southern Norway.

/.../

Fundamental questions at issue

Below is a presentation of the questions which I currently find most=20
relevant, and which I intend to investigate in my research.

1.     Is it possible to prove scientifically that =93English melodies=94=20=

spread throughout Western Europe during three relatively clearly=20
demarcated periods?
- the late 17th century
- the late 18th century
- the early 19th century
What caused these periods of diffusion? Which melodies (types of=20
melodies) spread during the respective periods? What is the earliest=20
evidence of the occurrence of the different types of melodies in the=20
Nordic countries, and how have they expanded and developed? Some=20
examples follow:

In older Nordic collections of dances and melodies there are clear=20
parallels with British collections from the same period, for example=20
John Playford=92s =93The English Dancing Master=94, and as early as the =
1670s=20
and =9280s the jig (=93gigue=94) started to become a common feature in=20=

Swedish dance music. How did this music come to Sweden? Playford=92s=20
collection was very popular in its day, and a large number of copies=20
were printed; is it, for example, possible that some of them ended up=20
in Sweden? In that case, how did the music and dance become=20
incorporated into the domestic repertoire?

Personally, I should imagine that one possible reason why music and=20
dances of British origin began to crop up in Sweden during this=20
particular period could be that it was during this time that the=20
republican regime of Oliver Cromwell (1599-1658) fell. The republicans=20=

had assumed power by revolution and by deposing King Charles I =96 an=20
action which provoked extremely negative reactions in other parts of=20
Europe. In his book =93Svenskt och brittiskt=94 (=93Swedish and =
British=94),=20
Birger Steckz=E9n relates how a large number of Swedes travelled to=20
England after the restoration of the monarchy in 1660, for instance to=20=

study at English universities. In Sweden, these contacts resulted in a=20=

growing interest in English culture. Could this have been a=20
contributory factor to the influx of British melodies and dances in=20
this period?

Then we have the problem of the many stylized French dances of English=20=

origin =96 for example the contradances =96 which become popular in =
Sweden=20
during the 18th century. They are a common feature in Swedish fiddlers=92=20=

books during the 1770s and later, but it is very seldom a matter of=20
tunes which are French in origin. On the contrary, they usually have=20
direct parallels in the reel and hornpipe traditions of the British=20
Isles. This begs the question of how large a part of the Nordic=20
=93engelska=94 repertoire was indeed passed on via France in the form of=20=

contradances and anglaises?

According to Magnus Gustavsson, there is plenty of circumstantial=20
evidence that suggests that the =93reel=94, after having broken out of =
its=20
area of origin in Scotland, reached Scandinavia =96 and was incorporated=20=

into the dance repertoire here =96 virtually as early as it reached=20
Ireland. Can this hypothesis be verified?

2.       How has the =93engelska=94 repertoire in Sweden developed and=20=

changed since the 19th century? The Gothenburg fiddler G=F6ran Premberg=20=

has, for example, pointed out an alteration in the playing of=20
=93engelska=94 tunes in Bohusl=E4n county during the 20th century. He =
has=20
drawn attention to the occurrence of two older bowing techniques which=20=

gradually disappeared during this period and which, he claims, have=20
great similarities to two northern English bowing styles called =93the=20=

Newcastle Style=94 and =93the Sand Dance Style=94. They were common =
around=20
the turn of the 19th century, and were passed on by occasional carriers=20=

of tradition such as the Bohusl=E4n fiddlers Ernst Abrahamsson and David=20=

Andersson. What constituted these techniques, when did they disappear=20
and for what reason?

How has this tradition been used in our time, for example by bands such=20=

as =93Atlantiska Orkestern=94 and =93Orust=94? In what way was the =
playing and=20
reception of Swedish folk music of British/Irish origin changed by the=20=

National Romantic movement of the 19th century, when in certain circles=20=

folk music became regarded as an expression of the =93national=20
character=94? Did music of obviously foreign origin become marginalized,=20=

or could it still be played and documented on equal terms with other=20
types of melodies?

If it should turn out that the four years I have at my disposal are=20
insufficient to enable me to complete my research, it would probably be=20=

necessary for me to concentrate solely on the first point, and deal=20
with the other issues as a separate project after I have completed my=20
PhD. However, I intend to leave the question of priorities and=20
limitations open until I start my research.

Another important aspect of the subject which must not be forgotten, is=20=

the role of dance in this context. The music I intend to deal with in=20
my research is, after all, intended to be danced to. I have discussed=20
this with Mats Nilsson in the Department of Ethnology at Gothenburg=20
University, and he has, among other things, pointed out the differences=20=

between the =93engelska=94 as music, the =93engelska=94 as dance and the=20=

=93engelska=94 as a term. The fact is that a type of music, a type of =
dance=20
and a type of term do not necessarily appear at the same time in=20
history.

The fact that a type of music appears in Swedish collections at a=20
certain time does not necessarily mean that the type of dance which=20
belongs to the music had yet been introduced. The music and the dance=20
could have travelled along different paths. Nor is it certain that a=20
particular type of dance has always been danced in the same manner.=20
What we, for instance, call the =93jig=94 today is not necessarily the =
same=20
type of dance as it was in the 17th century. In order to gain a general=20=

view of possible parallels between dance forms in the Nordic countries=20=

and the British Isles, one would have to look at contemporary=20
descriptions of the dances in question.

/.../

Where the research stands

As far as I have been able to discern, there is no research that deals=20=

specifically with British/Irish influences on Swedish folk music =96 on=20=

the whole, there is in fact very little research about the =93engelska=94=20=

as a type of music. On the other hand, there is research concerning=20
different aspects of the subject matter, which, in combination, may=20
provide a general picture. Documents and recordings of contradances,=20
=93engelskor=94 etc. from the 17th century onwards may constitute=20
interesting comparative material, which will make it possible to=20
delineate the spread of different melodies and as far as possible=20
ascertain their earliest appearance in the Nordic countries. It will=20
also be possible to determine how the playing of melodies has changed=20
over time. (1) Examples of such material are Johan Jacob Anckarstr=F6m=92s=
=20
book of dances from the 1760s, Carl-Gustaf Tullberg=92s book of fiddle=20=

tunes from 1822 (which, for instance, contains clearly identifiable=20
versions of the melodies =93The Irish Washerwoman=94 and =93Lord =
MacDonald=92s=20
Reel=94), and Jacob Mestmacher=92s music book from the mid-18th century.=20=

More recent documents which might prove useful include, for example,=20
the field recordings of folk music from Bohusl=E4n county made by the=20
musicologist and folk music expert M=E4rta Ramsten in the 1960s, and=20
=93Gamla danser i Sk=E5ne: engelskor=94 (=93Old Dances in =
Scania:engelskor=94) by=20
B=F6rje Wallin, which contains documentation of dances and melodies=20
covering a period from the 1830s to the 1940s. Svenskt visarkiv (=93The=20=

Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research=94), the music archives=20=

of Sm=E5land county and similar archives elsewhere in the Nordic=20
countries (and in the British Isles) are likely to contain plenty of=20
useful information.

What we, for instance, call the =93jig=94 today is not necessarily the

general view of possible parallels between dance forms in the Nordic

contemporary descriptions of the dances in question.

different aspects of the subject matter, which, in combination, may
provide a general picture. Documents and recordings of contradances,
=93engelskor=94 etc. from the 17th century onwards may constitute
interesting comparative material, which will make it possible to
delineate the spread of different melodies and as far as possible
ascertain their earliest appearance in the Nordic countries. It will
also be possible to determine how the playing of melodies has changed
over time. (1) Examples of such material are Johan Jacob Anckarstr=F6m=92s=

book of dances from the 1760s, Carl-Gustaf Tullberg=92s book of fiddle
tunes from 1822 (which, for instance, contains clearly identifiable

More recent documents which might prove useful include, for example,
the field recordings of folk music from Bohusl=E4n county made by the

=93Gamla danser i Sk=E5ne: engelskor=94 (=93Old Dances in =
Scania:engelskor=94)
by B=F6rje Wallin, which contains documentation of dances and melodies
covering a period from the 1830s to the 1940s. Svenskt visarkiv (=93The
Centre for Swedish Folk Music and Jazz Research=94), the music archives
of Sm=E5land county and similar archives elsewhere in the Nordic
countries (and in the British Isles) are likely to contain plenty of
useful information.

My name is Campbell Kaynor and I am probably best known as a New

been

the Vasterdala region from Appelbo, Vansbro, Dala Jarna.... but I am on

this list because I also enjoy the dances and melodies brought to

Dear Allison,

It's the "Boot Scootin' Boogie" by Brooks and Dunn. The guy with the mullet haircut is Billy Ray Cyrus and his hit tune was "Achy Breaky Heart" which also had a Country and Western line dance choreographed to it.

In the Lexington, Kentucky area a very popular line dance comes from the disco era, "The Electric Slide".  

Also English Country dance could be discribed as in "sets" of couples, 
2 couple, "Handel with Care"
3 couple, "Fandango"
4 couple, "Nonesuch"
5 couple, "Levi Jackson"

> Interesting thesis! One little thing: the paragraph where you say that country dances are still practiced in Anglo-American traditions in the form of "line dances and square dances"....in America "line dances" 
are something done to popular country-western music.

And I remember learning the Alley Cat, long long ago before line dances became C&W.
