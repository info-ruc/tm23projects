Dear Sir,

I am Micheal Harni A former government official of Liberia. Following the
exit of president Charles Taylor of Liberia from power under a West
African brokered peace agreement, led by Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo he was granted asylum by the Nigerian Government. In my position
as the Financial Secretary to the President and close confidant, I left
for Nigeria in his Entourage.

 My country has been engulfed in Protracted Civil war with rebels
controlling some parts of the country. During the war, President Taylor
disbursed large sums of Monies to buy the loyalty of the entire cabinet,
and I can say with all modesty that I was one of the Chief Beneficiaries
of this disbursement. This is aside from monies I used my official
position to acquire while in office. Since we relocated to Calabar,
Southern Nigeria all has been well, but with the recent indictment of
former President Taylor by the war crime tribunal sitting in Sierra Leone
and confirmed reports of a dedicated fund by the American Government to
capture him in order to face war crime charges have now decided to leave
the country. Presently I have funds totaling United State $15,000,000.
(Fifteen Million US Dollars) Which I intend to move oversea for
investment and spend the rest of my life there with my family.

This transaction is risk-free as all local arrangement has been made.

If you are prepared to assist to work with me I require the following:
Your Full Name and Address, Your Private Telephone, Fax Number and private
Email Address. As Compensation for your assistance you will retain 15% of
the Total sum, While 5% will be mapped out for local and International
expenses. Though we are not known to each other, I strongly believe that
through this transaction we would be able to forge a mutually beneficial
relationship between us, now and in the future.

Finally, the success of this transaction will depend to a great extent on
mutual trust, secrecy and Confidentiality from you.

I await your response by E-mail.micheal_harni2001@yahoo.co.uk

Best Regards,

Micheal Harni.
