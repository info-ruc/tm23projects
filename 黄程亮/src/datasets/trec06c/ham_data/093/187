We have visual images being flashed on the screen in very rapid 
succession.  The speed of the flashing does not always remain 
constant despite the programmed constant interstimulus interval.  
DMDX statesthat some images stayed on longer either because there 
were other programs running that took up "ticks", but more likely 
because of msec callback being too late.  Given the latter 
explanation, how might one approach resolving a late callback?
