Hi,

I asked a question a while ago about randomising the ISI, thanks very much 
for the suggestion of using the "set c1=" expression (below)
+1 <!regular item body> / <set c1=random(80)> <%ctr 1> / ;

I have since been having problems with the clock on command, it is no 
longer recognised..... I have tried including it in <*> rather than just * 
alone, also tried using <ClockOn>

I have included a sample from my item file below, any suggestions would be 
really appreciated.......

n54  s54 <cr> <nfb> t5000

+250  < ! %60 "+"/ %0 x370 "read" / ! %30 x225 "write" / %0 x370 * "_____" 
/ ! x225  " "> / <set c1=random(90) + 30> <%ctr 1> / ;

I would also like the last frame before the random delay to remain on 
screen until the participant responds, so is it possible to include the 
"set c1=" at the beginning of an item with a blank frame following it?

Thanks for your help
Emma
