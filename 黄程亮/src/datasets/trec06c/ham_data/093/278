   Hmm, got a lulu here.  It's the design of the expression evaluator 
that's busted which means fixing it is likely to be really 
entertaining.  Basically random(100) + 101 is evaluated as random(100 + 
101).  So if you're going to be using the functions max, min, abs, or 
random till I figure out how to fix the parser (and that could be a while, 
it's a recursive little mess of a beast) then have the function be the 
rightmost element.  Like 101 + random(100).
