Hi all,

      I have just installed the DMDX 3.0.31 on my IBM notebook model T40. 
After
testing with TimeDX, and I run DMDX, the following message pop out and I fail
to run some test program.

the msg is:
'cannot find register key......'
and it remind me to 'tune some values to anticipating the vertical retrace.'

I am not sure what the problem it is, can anyone of you give me some
suggestion?
 Thank you very much!!
