Hi,

Thanks for the suggestion Matthew- that is one possibility but it means 
each participant has the same random order of interval unless I make lots 
of rtf files with the item having a different macro at the end.

I have been trying to get the odd and even item number scramble(from the 
help pages) to work.  It seems like this should work but as yet I haven't 
figured it out, I have basically included a dummy item between each trial 
(it is just a blank frame of different durations).  All the odd items are 
trials and all the even items are blank frames.........

Has anyone successfully used this method of scrambling?

Emma
