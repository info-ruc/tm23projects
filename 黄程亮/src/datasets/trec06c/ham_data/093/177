Jonathan,

I’ve downloaded the latest  DMDX on a second computer and I get the 
same error, “FAILED TO FIND 100 CYCLES WITHOUT A MISSED RETRACE AFTER 
500 CYCLES”, when trying to set the Time Video Mode. The Vertical 
Retrace Sync Test Screen has some peculiar numbers. For example, 
the “Refresh Rate” has value “0.000” for “Tuned Value”, “Automatic 
Value” and “Registry”. The Sleep Times has value 4294967293 
for  “Tuned Value”, “Automatic Value” and “Registry”.

The 4294967293 value for Sleep Time looks familiar, it’s twice the 
maximum value for a long integer (2,147,483,647 times 2) variable, 
which suggests a minor variable declarative error or a variable 
overflow error in your code. Its a possibility!

This computer is a
AMD Athlon XP2100+
1.74Ghz, 512 MB, 32MB Video On-Board motherboard
Running XP windows.

I try an older version of DMDX and see if it works.

Warm regards,
