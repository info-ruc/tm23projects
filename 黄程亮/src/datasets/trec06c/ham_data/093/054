Thanks very much for the info. Jonathan.  One more quick question- It seems 
like it will allow me to specify the maximum value of the random frame 
duration but not the minimum which defaults to " 0 " is this true?  Or 
could I include a minimum value, I want the shortest frame between items to 
be 500 msecs......
