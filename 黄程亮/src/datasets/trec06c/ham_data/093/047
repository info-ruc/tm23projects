hey

just wanted to drop a line to say that i haven't completely fallen off 
the face of the earth - i'm working hard to finish up and ship off two 
papers and to get an experiment going - and i have 1 review left to 
write (in the past couple of weeks i've reviewed 2 grants and 2 papers!) 
- so things have been a bit nuts

after that i plan to get back on things - okay?

what's up with you?
