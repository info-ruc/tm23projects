Dear Pr. Woolams,
 
I am Abdessatar Mahfoudhi from Ottawa. I was wondering if you could help me with this design question in DMDX.
What is the way to distinguish target words (and their primes) in different conditions from each other as well as from fillers, and practice trials, I mean what numbers do you give them. 
 
Thank you so much
