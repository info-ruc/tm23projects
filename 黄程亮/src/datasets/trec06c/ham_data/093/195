Glad you asked whether or not I could play it. I actually *could* play mov files
(QT), but not mpg's or avi's.  Microsoft had just nagged me into downloading
Windows Media 9, and it caused me no end of trouble. I uninstalled it & went
back to 7.1, -can at least play these file types from explorer.

I also uninstalled and reinstalled the latest version of DMDX. Unfortnately, not
only does it still say "VFW_E_NOT_FOUND" etc., but it will not do the
Time/Video test. Plugs in the following values: Sleep-4294;Timeout-.3;Max to
Blit-300;Refresh Interval-0. When I try to run the test it complains about
these values.

I did notice in DXDiag that  Direct 3D acceleration & texture accelation arent
supported -would this be a problem at all?
