   Courtesy of the folks at the University of Leeds we have an extension to 
the <rcot> keyword in DMDX 3.0.3.0 (dated 04/04/04, pretty cool I thought) 
that allows you to provide an event name that DMDX will signal every clock 
in addition to the normal rcot functionality to allow inter-process 
synchronization of DMDX with whatever custom software you care to 
write.  Details are in the <rcot> documentation.

                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X

   It's not an optical illusion. It just looks like one.
