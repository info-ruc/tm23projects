Thank you, 
I turned off all applications and the problem persists:
 
"Get 
DC for primary memory surface failed!
DDERR_SURFACELOST(887601C2)
Access to this surface is being refused because the surface is gone. The 
DIRECTDRAW SURFACE object representing this surface should have restore 
called on it."

I also retested the video modes and now none works!

Do you think I should get a new video card with its separate memory?
