   Hmm, there's no difference between 3.1.01 and 3.1.00 that I can see that 
would affect the video refresh synchronizing.  I've seen on a couple of odd 
machines recently that I've had to turn off the Read Between Flips to Stop 
Cheating drivers.  You can also turn off the Enhanced Retrace Rate 
detection if all else fails but I don't recommend it, the old routines 
could think they were working when they weren't.  Happily the worst mistake 
that can be made is that a frame is presented for one tick longer than what 
DMDX thinks a tick is.
