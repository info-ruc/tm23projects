   We usually synchronize machines in such circumstances with a signal from 
an interface card, can your eye tracker record another channel of data?  Or 
alternatively can be started by the signal from DMDX?  Barring that the 
time stamp of the file is all that exists right now and I doubt that giving 
you a millisecond accurate time stamp would help much as the probability of 
the two clocks being in synch to the millisecond is zero.  Even if you have 
them synched to an external time source both machines will drift almost 
immediately.   Which is which recording a signal from DMDX in the eye 
tracking data is the best solution.
