I don't know if this is the easiest way to do it, but when I've needed
to do this I've appended a macro variable on to the end of my items
(e.g. +1 * "target" ; 999 ~a ;  (where "~a" would expand into "%50 /!
c").  If you develop 10 or so different macros (where each one specifies
a different duration), it'll give you a pretty good range of ISIs and
it's easy to randomly assign them to your items if you use a spreadsheet
to put your items together.

if there's an easier way, i'd like to hear about it
