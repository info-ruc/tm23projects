Academic Press formally released the copyright back to myself and the
editors when the book went out of print and they had no plans to reprint it.
My coauthors and I agreed to put it on the Internet, so it would be
available to the world.  We would be delighted if you would copy it to your
site, as long as you give appropriate attribution and credit.
