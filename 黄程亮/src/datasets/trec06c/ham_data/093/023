   Hello, everyone.
   I’m preparing an fMRI experiment about working memory now. And I found DMDX is a very useful and simple software to present the stimuli. But I meet a question: If I want to use it in an ERP experiment, which command can I use to send the code of stimulus to the EEG files? As you know, the ERPs must be averaged by the type of stimuli, so I must have the different kinds of codes for sorting. By the way, the soft I used is the Scan4.3 of Neuroscan company. 
   Thanks a lot.
