DMDX finally (somehow) worked after the complaints it had about surface memory and XP (and therefore DMDX) handles Arabic with no problem at all.
 
Thank you all

Probably. Memory surfaces aren't supposed to be losable -- no matter 
what. On the other hand if you're using Windows 98 or ME it's possible to 
get the OS and it's video drivers totally snarled, so it may just need some 
major fiddling done to it. Things like deleting the video card in the 
device manager and letting it find it again. Later video drivers also work.
