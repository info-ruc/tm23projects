Hi everyone

I'm trying to set up an experiment about action recognition. I'm intending
to do a kind of gating task with videos of actions. To this end I use the
pdvt
function (Play Digital Video Frame to N). The ouput is OK with videos wich
have 15 frames per sec but not with videos wich have 25 frames per sec. The
problem is that, in the output, it is said that DMDX seems to played 1 frame
more
than what it is supposed to do. Unfortunately the videos I need for my
experiment have
25 frames per sec. So, what should I do? Is there something wrong with the
ouput?

This is an item files presenting 2 videos : Ciseaux1400 wich have 15 frames
per
sec (duration =1400 Number of frames= 22) and pianoval3 wich have 25 frames
per sec (duration = 1400, number of frames=35).
