   It did when I wrote it but .MOV is moving target so getting old 
operating systems to work with the latest and greatest compression formats 
is fraught with peril.

   If you're still using win98 all bets are off, I haven't used that in

   I suspect you need to be using XP.  Or at the very least reformatting 
and reinstalling 98 as it just plain stops working past a certain point.
