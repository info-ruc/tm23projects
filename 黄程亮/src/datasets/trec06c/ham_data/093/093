   Ever notice that DMDX updates tend to come in bunches?  3.0.3.1 fixes a 
problem with Word's smart quotes that I noticed the other day (probably 
weeks ago) but was too busy to fix.  Turns out that the 12/01/03 3.0.2.7 
release for stopping smart quote handling if the character set is 134 for 
asian fonts needed an else in there if the font hadn't been defined which 
can happen under some odd circumstances...

   It's not an optical illusion. It just looks like one.
