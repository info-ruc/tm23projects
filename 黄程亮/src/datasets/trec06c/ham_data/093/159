Subject: [DMDX] filler items after error-responses

Participants are often distracted by negative feedback which makes
response times to the following item relatively unreliable. Therefore, I
would like to insert a filler-item after each error-response.

I wanted to do this with <Call If Wrong>, sending the program to a list
of filler-items that was originally skipped, and <return> to continue
the program. This works fine, however, so far the filler item that is
inserted after an error-respons is always the same.

In order to send the program to different filler-items every time a
mistake has been made, I defined a counter <set c1=N> and then ended
each filler item with <inc c1>. Now I would like to use the variable c1
in <Call If Wrong>. However, this function only accepts numbers and I
don't see how I can get the <Indexed Call> function to work
conditionally (i.e. only if an error occurred).

Any suggestions?

Thanks!
heike
