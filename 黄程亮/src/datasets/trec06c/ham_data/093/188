   Numerous solutions here.  If you're using the D parameter (<Delay>) then 
that can cause the first frame to be late.  Other solutions range from 
tweaking the timing parameters of that video mode (see the TimeDX 
documentation) to removing all extraneous applications (like RealPlayer and 
the Office Startup crap) to getting new video drivers to reinstalling the 
OS to reformatting the machine to getting new hardware (either video card 
or the whole machine) to trying XP if you aren't already using it and the 
hardware can handle it.  Probably other things I'm forgetting too.
