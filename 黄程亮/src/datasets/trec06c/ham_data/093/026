  You need to have a parallel interface card before you can send codes to 
Neuroscan, DMDX refers to them as PIO cards.  Assuming you're using 
hardware that someone else has setup you would use the <Output X> keyword, 
around here 8 communication lines are run to the Neuroscan machines 
allowing codes from 0 to 255.  There's documentation in  TimeDX on setting 
up PIO.
