Hello!

We are starting a multi-site research project which includes 
an experiment in which RT data is collected.  The test 
involves a child (4-5 yr old) pressing a button on a joystick 
in response to a stimulus.

The question to the list is: do you recommend any particular 
brand/manufacturer of joystick that will give the best 
accuracy and durability?  Are off-the-shelf gaming joysticks 
sufficient (with proper software) to achieve millisecond 
precision?

Thanks in advance!
