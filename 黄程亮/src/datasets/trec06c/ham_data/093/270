Dear Sir,

I am TONY OWEN , Bank manager of TRADEVCO bank of LIBERIA, . I have urgent
and very confidential business proposition for you.

On june 6, 1999, an American mining consultant/contractor with the Liberia
mining corporation, Mr ROBERT FISHER made a numbered time (fixed) Deposite
for twelve (12) calendar months, valved at US$18,.500,000.00(EIGHTEEN
MILLION,FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS) in my branch.Upon maturity, I
sent a routine notification to his faaorwarding address but got no reply.
After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers, the LIBERIAN mining corporation that Mr ROBERT FISHER
died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out
that he died without making a (WILL) and all attempts to trace his next of
kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr ROBERT
FISHER did not declare any kin or relation in his official documents,
including his Bank deposite paper work in my Bank.This sum
US$18.5000.000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the in
terest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year.No one has ever come forward to claim the fund.According to our
LIBERIAN Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert
to the ownership of the Liberian governmen
t if nobody applies to claim the funds.

Consequently,my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next
of kin to Mr ROBERT FISHER so that the fruits of this old mans labour
will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is
simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full name and address
so that an Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
which will put you in place the next of kin. We shall employ the service
of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL
and to obtain the necessary documents and the of probate/adminisration in
your favour for the tranfer. A bank account in any part of the world which
you will provide will then facilitate the tranfer of this money to you as
the beneficiary/next of kin.
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ration of
60% for me and 40% for you.

There is no risk at all as the paper work for this transaction will be
done by the Attorney and my position as the branch manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please
reply immediately via telephone or fax number above or through my private
email address above. Upon your response, I shall then provide with more
details and relevant documents that will help you to understand the
ansaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply through telephone and fax above or my email
address.

Best regards,

TONY OWEN
