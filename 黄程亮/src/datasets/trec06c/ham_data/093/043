Hello,

I'm trying to interface a DMDX experiment with an eye tracker, and I'm having trouble synchronising the two data sets. I need to be able to link each eye position, of which there are 50 a second, to what dmdx is displaying at that time, so it's crucial that I can tell when each process starts.

I've used <rcot> to give me the millisecond starting point of each trial within the experiment, but I need to know the exact millisecond starting point of the experiment itself for this to be useful. So far all that I have is the second time stamp on the top of a ZIL or AZK file. Is there anyway to get this information? Or is anyone aware of a workaround that I could use?

Thanks in advance,
Ronan
