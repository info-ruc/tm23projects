   DMDX will use up to 24 frame buffers if the video card has the memory 
for them, otherwise it uses as many as it can make.  Which means that with 
an older video card or a really big and deep video mode there may be fewer 
frame buffers than there are in an item file which means DMDX has to load 
frame buffers as the item is displaying.  On some hardware this is no big 
deal, on others it's problematic and it sounds like this is exactly the 
issue you are facing.  Sometimes this can be ameliorated by changing the 
Number of Lines to Blit in the Advanced Vertical Retrace Synch Test.
