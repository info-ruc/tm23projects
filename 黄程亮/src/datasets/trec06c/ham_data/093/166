Hello,
 
I am trying a visual priming lexical decision task, when in the midde of the experiment show I get the following message and the computer crashes: "Resetting the Shift Key 5 times turns on Sticky Keys."
 
After resarting my laptop (built in video card  Mobility Radeon 9000) and running the task again, I get what seems to be a more serious error: "Get DC for primary memory surface failed!
DDERR_SURFACELOST(887601C2)
Access to this surface is being refused because the surface is gone. The DIRECTDRAW SURFACE object representing this surface should have restore called on it."
 
Any ideas as to what these 2 errors mean and how to fix them? (is the video card part of the problem?)
 
Thank you so much for your help
