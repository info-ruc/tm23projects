     You are using the latest DMDX I hope?  If so you probably want to hunt 
up some new video drivers.  If the latest ones still carry on like that 
then you'll have to hunt up some old ones.  The trouble is with these high 
performance cards is that in order to make their card look the best in 
benchmarks the drivers do all sorts of borderline illegal things and that 
often screws up TimeDX,   sometimes the plane jane video card is a superior 
choice.  If you can't get it to stabilize under any circumstances you will 
have to use the Refresh Rate test and lower the number cycles that it looks 
for without an error (the Number of Cycles to Time).

   And that's 512 megabytes of RAM, like "512MB RAM" ;)
