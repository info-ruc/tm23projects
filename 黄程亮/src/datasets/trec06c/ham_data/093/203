The help file said DMDX would support QT. -But never mind that, I could always
save them into a different format. It won't run AVIs or MPGs either. Same error
message (VFW_E-NOT_FOUND...).

No arguments, my office machine is still at Win98 (no XP) and it has led an
exciting life.  But my lab machine has hardly been messed with at all and it
doesn't work on that either (also Win98). They both have 3D acceleration
enabled at this point (must have turned it off accidentally).

I did plug in some plausible values so at least it *runs*, but same error
message on Digital Video test. I've messed with options under "Refresh Rate
(Basic) and Task Priorities" (Advanced) to no avail. Do I have to override the
DirectX refresh rate values or something? I could swear I've gotten the example
to run in the test before...
