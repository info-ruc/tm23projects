   Correction, the second to last frame.  Setting the duration of the last 
frame achieves nothing as the duration of a frame only determines when the 
next frame is to be displayed, if there are no more frames in an item it's 
a null statement.  So you want something like:

+1 <!regular item body> / <set c1=random(80)> <%ctr 1> / ;
