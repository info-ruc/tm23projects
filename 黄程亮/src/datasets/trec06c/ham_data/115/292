 Sorry, I wasn't too clear. Not a non-ISSA networked machine, just a non
 netBSD workstation. The problem applies to the ISSA Windows and
 Macintosh machines that are on the network. As I try it now, it may also
 not work properly on the workstations as well.
 
 For example, I get:
 
 [greg greg]$ mathematica
 xset:  bad font path element (#64), possible causes are:
 ~    Directory does not exist or has wrong permissions
 ~    Directory missing fonts.dir
 ~    Incorrect font server address or syntax
 set:  bad font path element (#64), possible causes are:
 ~    Directory does not exist or has wrong permissions
 ~    Directory missing fonts.dir
 ~    Incorrect font server address or syntax
 
 
 followed by an error window about fonts. Oliver has seen the error as
 well. Can this be re-opened?
 
 Thanks,

 So the problem you're reporting is that when forwarding the X display
 from a NetBSD machine to a non-NetBSD machine such as Windows or
 Macintosh, the font path is not found to be correct?  The category
 os-netbsd seems wrong, then.
 
 This would be a problem in the X server on the machine that is doing the
 display.  If we provide an X server in the Windows installation, then
 this needs to be fixed there (and this will become a windows PR).
 
 For the single Macintosh machine we currently support, we should install
 a native version of mathematica (if we have one) and obsolete the need
 to forward your display to an X server that would have to have been
 installed by the user (since we did not install it) which that user
 could of course also fix fontpath wise.

 It happens even on the NetBSD workstation on my desk. It's a 'xset' issue:
 
 
 [greg greg]$ mathematica
 xset:  bad font path element (#56), possible causes are:
     Directory does not exist or has wrong permissions
     Directory missing fonts.dir
     Incorrect font server address or syntax
 xset:  bad font path element (#56), possible causes are:
     Directory does not exist or has wrong permissions
     Directory missing fonts.dir
     Incorrect font server address or syntax
 
 
 The Mathematica documentation shows how to solve this by setting the
 font path with xset, but I can't seem to find it now ... anyway, the
 main problem was the the xset fp whatever command which did not fix the
 problem!
 
 Just run mathematica and you should see the problem.

 OK, now I'm feeling like I'm on crack. I logged out and tried twm and kde as
 my window managers and Mathematica worked. Now I'm back into gnome and it
 still works. I have no idea what just happened, except I entered the xset
 +fp /usr/local/mathematica5.2/SystemFiles/Fonts/Type1 command before I
 logged out the first time.
 
 Oh, well I hope this helps.

 I *still* can't reproduce the problem.  I've tried four different
 workstations, and even tried using your account.  No matter what I do,
 mathematica starts up without giving any problems.
 
 If you still see the problem, please specify on which machine you're
 locally logged in (ie the X server is running) and from which machine
 the display is forwarded.

 The problem only manifests itself under the following circumstances:
 
 - the user is logged into lab.cs from a windows machine, providing a
   cygwin X server to which the display is forwarded
 
 - the user is logged into lab.cs from a Mac OS X machine, providing an X
   server to which the display is forwarded
 
 - the user is logged in from some other unsupported private laptop and
   forwards the X display to that machine

 So... to fix the problem, the following should be done:
 
 - mathematica should be installed on all supported machines locally
 - Somebody (tm) needs to write up the instructions necessary to forward
   the display and copy over the appropriate fonts for machines that we
   do not support.

State-Changed-Why:

We have determined the problem to be on the user-site of the
remote connection.  The NetBSD machines work fine, the Mac OS
workstation we support now has a local copy of the application
and the remaining windows machines should get a local copy of
mathematica installed as well.
