Founder Paul Ginsparg Named Recipient of Paul Evan Peters Award</strong></font></h2>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Paul
Ginsparg, physicist and Internet scholarly communications pioneer, is
the latest recipient of the Paul Evan Peters Award, announced today by
the Coalition for Networked Information (CNI), the Association of
Research Libraries (ARL), and EDUCAUSE. The award will be presented on
April 3, 2006, at the CNI Membership Meeting in Arlington, VA, where
Ginsparg will deliver the Paul Peters Award lecture at the opening
plenary. A professor of physics, computing and information science at
Cornell University, Ginsparg has distinguished himself as the visionary
behind arXiv (<a href="http://arxiv.org">http://arxiv.org</a>), an
Internet e-print archive for articles in the sciences, which allows
scholars to circulate and comment on research prior to publication in
traditional peer-reviewed journals, thereby significantly reducing the
amount of time it takes for an article to be available to researchers.
Started in 1991 as a service for preprints in physics, arXiv eventually
expanded to include mathematics, computer science and quantitative
biology. Today, the resource boasts open access to over 350,000
articles. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">"Paul
Ginsparg's accomplishments as a theoretical physicist, alone,
distinguish him as a superb scholar, but his innovations in scientific
publication, for which the Paul Evan Peters award honors him, truly
places him in the annals of history as a transformative figure who has
changed the landscape of scholarly communication forever," remarked
Ronald Larsen, Dean of the School of Information Sciences at the
University of Pittsburgh and a member of the award search committee.
"This is a richly deserved award," Larsen continued, "that honors the
legacy of Paul Evan Peters."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Commenting
on how Ginsparg's brainchild has revolutionized science publishing, in
the October 2005 issue of Sky &amp; Telescope, author Richard Tresch
Fienberg reports that papers published in more than a dozen major
astronomy journals are twice as likely to be cited by other researchers
if they have also appeared on arXiv. He observes, "Clearly,
professional astronomers are gravitating toward [arXiv] as their
primary&#8212;perhaps even exclusive&#8212;reference source." Expressing this view
directly as part of the 2001 UNESCO Expert Conference Electronic
Publishing in Science, Ginsparg wrote, "The essential question for
'Electronic Publishing in Science' is how our scientific research
communications infrastructure should be reconfigured to take maximal
advantage of newly evolving electronic resources."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">The
award&#8212;named for CNI's founding director&#8212;recognizes Ginsparg as creative
and innovative, capable of taking a fresh view of conventional models
of exchange and collaboration, which, eventually, led to a
groundbreaking approach to scholarly communication. "Dr. Ginsparg has
helped to usher in an extraordinary new era in scholarly communication.
I am delighted that he has been selected to receive the Paul Evan
Peters Award&#8212;his contributions clearly illustrate the spirit of this
award," said Duane Webster, ARL Executive Director.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">In
2002, Ginsparg was named a fellow of the John D. and Catherine T.
MacArthur Foundation. Upon announcing the award, the foundation stated
that, "Ginsparg has deliberately transformed the way physics gets
done&#8212;challenging conventional standards for review and communication of
research and thereby changing the speed and mode of dissemination of
scientific advances."</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Commenting
on the impact Ginsparg's work has had on scholarly communication, CNI
Executive Director Clifford Lynch said, "Paul's work has shown how
technology can fundamentally change the patterns of flow and the pace
of scientific communication and has challenged scholarly disciplines to
reconsider their practices." </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Ginsparg joins
previous award recipients Brewster Kahle (2004), Vinton Cerf (2002),
and Tim Berners-Lee (2000).</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Three
nonprofit organizations, the Coalition for Networked Information, the
Association of Research Libraries, and EDUCAUSE, sponsor the Paul Evan
Peters Award, which was established with additional funding from
Microsoft and Xerox Corporations. The award honors the memory and
accomplishments of Paul Evan Peters (1947&#8211;1996). Peters was a visionary
and a coalition builder in higher education and the world of scholarly
communication. He led CNI from its founding in 1990 with informed
insight, exuberant direction, eloquence, and awareness of the needs of
its varied constituencies of librarians, technologists, publishers, and
others in the digital world.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">CNI
is a coalition of some 200 member institutions dedicated to supporting
the transformative promise of networked information technology for the
advancement of scholarly communication and the enrichment of
intellectual productivity. ARL's membership includes the leading
research libraries in North America. Its mission is to shape and
influence forces affecting the future of research libraries in the
process of scholarly communication, promoting equitable access to and
effective use of recorded knowledge in support of teaching, research,
scholarship, and community service. EDUCAUSE is an association of
nearly 1,900 colleges, universities, and education organizations whose
mission is to advance higher education by promoting the intelligent use
of information technology.</font></p>
