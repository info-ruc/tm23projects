BUSH AXING LIBRARIES WHILE PUSHING FOR MORE=20
RESEARCH =AD EPA Set to Close Library Network and Electronic Catalog

Washington, DC =AD Under President Bush=92s proposed=20
budget, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency=20
is slated to shut down its network of libraries=20
that serve its own scientists as well as the=20
public, according to internal agency documents=20
released today by Public Employees for=20
Environmental Responsibility (PEER). In addition=20
to the libraries, the agency will pull the plug=20
on its electronic catalog which tracks tens of=20
thousands of unique documents and research=20
studies that are available nowhere else.

Under Bush=92s plan, $2 million of a total agency=20
library budget of $2.5 million will be lost,=20
including the entire $500,000 budget for the EPA=20
Headquarters library and its electronic catalog=20
that makes it possible to search for documents=20
through the entire EPA library network. These=20
reductions are just a small portion of the $300=20
million in cuts the administration has proposed for EPA operations.

At the same time, President Bush is proposing to=20
significantly increase EPA research funding for=20
topics such as nanotechnology, air pollution and=20
drinking water system security as part of his=20
=93American Competitive Initiative.=94

=93How are EPA scientists supposed to engage in=20
cutting edge research when they cannot find what=20
the agency has already done?=94 asked PEER=20
Executive Director Jeff Ruch, noting that EPA=20
Administrator Stephen Johnson is moving to=20
implement the proposed cuts as soon as possible.=20
=93The President=92s plan will not make us more=20
competitive if we have to spend half our time re-inventing the wheel.=94

EPA=92s own scientists and enforcement staff are=20
the principal library users. EPA=92s scientists use=20
the libraries to research questions such as the=20
safety of chemicals and the environmental effects=20
of new technologies. EPA enforcement staff use=20
the libraries to obtain technical information to=20
support pollution prosecutions and to track the=20
business histories of regulated industries.

EPA currently operates a network of 27 libraries=20
operating out of its Washington, D.C.=20
Headquarters and ten regional offices across the=20
country. The size of the cuts will force the=20
Headquarters library and most of the regional=20
libraries to shut their doors and cease=20
operations. Each year, the EPA libraries =96
    * Handle more than 134,000 research requests=20
from its own scientific and enforcement staff;
    * House and catalog an estimated 50,000=20
=93unique=94 documents that are available nowhere else; and
    * Operate public reading rooms and provide=20
the public with access to EPA databases.

=93Access to information is one of the best tools=20
we have for protecting the environment,=94 added=20
Ruch, calling the cuts the =93epitome of penny wise=20
and pound foolish.=94 =93By contrast, closing the=20
Environmental Protection Agency libraries=20
actually threatens to subtract from the sum total of human knowledge.=94
