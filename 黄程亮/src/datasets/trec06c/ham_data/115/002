LETTER

(This letter will be sent to all members of the House and Senate 
Appropriations Committees, the House Government Reform Committee, the 
Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, and the 
Secretary of Commerce and the Director of the U.S. Census Bureau.)


February 10, 2006

Dear Senator or Representative,

As economists and social-science researchers, we are concerned about 
provisions of the President's FY2007 budget that call for the elimination 
of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), effective in 
September 2006.

The SIPP is the only large-scale survey explicitly designed to analyze the 
impact of a wide variety of government programs on the well-being of 
American families. As a longitudinal survey that tracks the same families 
over time, it provides researchers with unique information on the extent to 
which programs like Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), 
Medicaid, Social Security, and unemployment insurance are successful in 
meeting families' basic needs and promoting upward mobility. It also tracks 
health insurance coverage, and provides more in-depth information than 
other government survey on work-family issues, such as maternity leave, 
child care, and child support.

The Census Bureau first fielded the SIPP in 1984, after over six years of 
careful design and testing. Since then, the Census Bureau and 
social-science researchers have gained extensive experience with the survey 
and worked together to refine and improve it. The SIPP has served as the 
basis for thousands of academic papers and government and independent 
policy reports on poverty, income mobility, and the effectiveness of state 
and federal government programs. Over the last quarter century, hundreds of 
millions of public and private dollars have been invested in the 
development of the SIPP and the capacity to analyze its data. This 
investment will be lost if the SIPP is eliminated.

The total cost of the SIPP is about $40 million per year, yet it provides a 
constant stream of in-depth data that enables government, academic, and 
independent researchers to evaluate the effectiveness and improve the 
efficiency of several hundred billion in spending on social programs.

We urge you to fully fund the SIPP so that we may continue to use it to 
evaluate the effectiveness of public policy in promoting the well-being of 
America's families.
