The first two papers focus on two kinds of related attacks that can be
launched on P2P networks. The first is Sybil, which is where an attacker
tries to forge multiple identities in order to undermine the system. The
paper outlines several requirements that can be put into place to restrict
the number of identities a single entity could assume, which even though
it cannot fully prevent a Sybil attack, can severely limit the amount of
damage that can be done. The basic requirements are some sort of
constrained resource test for validation that is conducted simultaneously
across the network. In that case, if the test requires c resources to
answer correctly and a fradulent entity has at most k times more
resources, then that entity can assume at most k identities since the
validation is done simultaneously.
The second paper deals with Eclipse attacks, where an attacker tries to
take control of the routing done in a network by inserting itself or other
faulty nodes into numerous routing tables and links. The base assumption
is that the network has some constraint of the type above on Sybil
attacks; otherwise, an attacker could forge multiple identities and simply
overwhelm the number of legitimate nodes with faulty ones. The authors
limit the damage a node can do by limiting the out- and in-degree of
nodes, so that no node is pointed to by too many nodes, and no node takes
up the in-degrees of too many nodes. This prevents a small fraction of the
nodes from dominating a large fraction of the routing table entries, and
increase the probability that routing paths chosen do not pass through
faulty nodes. The degree bounds are enforced using anonymous auditing to
check the neighbor sets of its neighbors. Assuming that the anonymity
works and the challenged node does not know who issued the challenge, the
challenged node would have difficulty faking a neighbor set that contains
the unknown node while hiding some of its out-degrees so that it appears
as if it is under the limit.
The last paper is far more general than either of the previous ones. It
investigates three factors in P2P network security: nodeID generation,
routing table maintenence, and message routing. For nodeID generation,
their conclusion was that distributed generation is unable to prevent
Sybil attacks, and that the best bet was to have a Certifying Authority
with a requirement for attaining a certificate to make it expensive or
impossible to obtain a large number of certificates (eg. monetary or
unique identifications). For routing table updates, they constrain the
routing table and use multiple bootstraps to prevent a corrupt bootstrap
from unduly influencing a new node. The constraints could be such things
as the out- in-degree constraints from the Eclipse paper, though the
authors here do not offer any specific suggestions.
The main content of the paper involves routing failure detection. The
authors add deterministically chosen replicas for every root, and when a
node initiates a query, it checks to ensure that the node it is sending
the query to has a valid set of replicas. For Pastry, the replicas are the
neighborhood leaf set, and the deterministic property of that is a
probabilistic maximum width of the set and a balanced left-right property.
If the replica set returned from the targetted key node is deemed to be
invalid or doesn't even reach the sender, then redundant routing is
initiated.

The idea outlined in the Eclipse paper still seems quite vulnerable to
attackers. Even though it would be difficult to control the entire routing
table of the majority of the nodes in the network, a dedicated set of
faulty nodes could still consume all of the in-degrees of certain selected
sections of a network, possibly partitioning that segment of the ring.
Furthermore, all of the ideas outlined in the three papers are only
feasible for networks above a certain size. Smaller networks are naturally
much more vulnerable since an attacker could easily muster the resources
or entities to control the majority of the nodes in it.
