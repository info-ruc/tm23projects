This message is being sent using E-mail to Groups ( UM Employees ).

This is an alert that we have had several cases of stolen classroom
technology equipment over the last few weeks.  

About two weeks ago, a ceiling-mounted projector was stolen from
Bondurant.  In this case, the projector had a security cable, and special
equipment was used to cut the cable and remove the projector from the
ceiling mount.  

Last week a monitor was stolen from a lectern in Bishop.  In this case,
the room was left unlocked.

This week, another computer and monitor were stolen from Bishop.  In this
case, both the room and the lectern were left unlocked.

Please be aware that we seem to be experiencing a series of thefts and
that you should take every precaution in safeguarding equipment.  Simple
steps such as making sure that the room and lectern are locked may help
prevent future cases.
