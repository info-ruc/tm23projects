I can double or triple the amount of time DMDX waits for a thread to die 
before it decides that the thread isn't going to die.  Currently it waits 
for a second, a figure I picked out of the ether as an unreasonably long 
time to wait for a thread to die, plainly I can triple it.  I'll look at it 
later today.
