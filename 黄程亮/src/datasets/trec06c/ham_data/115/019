Hi,

The paramter line is

<ep> <id "keyboard"> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 60> <clfb> <t30000> <id digitalvox> <xyjustification 
1>
<id recordvocal 500> <DefaultBackgroundColor black>
<eop>

+118 g "background", %75 <xy 512, 384> "+" / * g "background", <xy 522, 334> "MASTER", <xy 522,
>>384> "TOSS", <xy 522, 434> "FINGER" %500 / g "background", <xy 522, 384> g"AbPic4" %500 / g 
>>"background", <xy 522, 334> "MASTER", <xy 522, 384> "TOSS", <xy 522, 434> "FINGER";
I may have been unclear in what I wrote earlier.  I want the screen to clear as soon as a response 
is registered. The program is recording reaction time and voice recordings just fine.  The problem 
is that the first two segments are 5 seconds each, but if the subject answers 2s after problem 
onset, the screen doesn't clear for 8 more seconds (i.e. until the very beginning of the final 
segment).

Any assistance would be great -- thanks again.

Carlo
