Saroiu et al.'s "A measurement study..." present measurement studies of
the p2p content distribution systems Gnutella and Napster.  A methodology
for colling information related to IP address/port, upstream and
downstream bandwidth (as reported and directly measured), node lifetimes
(and statuses throughout lifetimes) and workload generation is presented. 
This methodology is used to collect and present data regarding the node
composition of these networks: bandwidth capabilities as reported vs
measured, which can differ significantly for a significant number of peers
and varies considerably across peers, workload generation distribution and
the distribution of nodes which service that workload.  The conclusion
made from this presentation is that nodes in these networks can vary
considerably in bandwidth and workload generation and servicing.  And
nodes may often misrepresent themselves or provide no benefit to system
(such as serving content).

Gummadi et al.'s "Measurement, Modelling..." presents another study of a
p2p content distribution system, Kazaa on the University of Washington
campus.  Specifically the system considered the Kazaa traffic leaving out
of and coming into the campus network.  Similar statistics to "A
measurement Study..." were taken over a 200-day period.  Additionally,
content classes were identified.  The presentation here highlights the
significant difference between the workload distribution between a p2p
content distribution network and the web.  The notion of
"fetch-at-most-once" behavior in Kazaa is compared to "fetch-repeatedly"
behavior in the web.  This difference is pointed to as driving the
divergence from Zipf workload distribution in p2p networks.  A model of
this "fetch-at-most-once" behavior is presented which highlights that
object and client births drive the workload in a p2p file sharing
application versus object change which drives web workloads.  Finally, the
notion of locality aware routing is considered as a possible approach to
address bandwidth consumption experienced by oganizational networks like
Universities.
