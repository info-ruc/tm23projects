Paper 1: Secure routing for structured peer-to-peer overlay networks
Paper 2: The Sybil attack?
Paper 3: Defending Against Eclipse Attacks on Overlay Networks.

In Paper 1 the authors address security issues in overlay networks,
especially large-scale attacks when a fraction f (0 <= f < 1) of
the nodes on the network may be faulty/malicious in coalitions
of size of up c*f (where 1/N <= c <= f).
The first issue they address is thwarting attacks directed at replica
roots by a 'secure routing primitive' which ensures that when a
legitimate node asks for content, all non-faulty replica roots are
reached w.h.p. The paper then elaborates on how this primitive is to
be accomplished, and discusses three problems that need to be solved.
1) Securely assign nodeIDs to nodes: If an attacker could choose his
   nodeID, or forge enough clones to control a large enough fraction of
   the nodeID space (Sybil attack), she could take on the overlay
   network (e.g. route traffic to her, partition the ring, etc.)
   The authors mention the use of central certification of nodeIDs,
   but this solution is awkward for a number of reasons - it relies on
   central figures which counters the p2p paradigm, and their assumption
   that malicious users usually only control a few IP addresses is based
   only on faith. They then move on to the terrible idea of charging
   users $20 for a nodeID, or binding actual identities to nodeIDs
   (confiscating anonymity) and argue that this should prevent Sybil
   attacks. Fortunately, the authors realize that these ideas are not
   a solution, and conclude by listing other ideas, such as solving
   crypto puzzles or computing particular SHA1 hashes, all of these
   are based on the assumption that the attacker has very limited
   resources to mount an attack.

2) Securely maintain the routing tables: The authors argue that securely
   assigning nodeIDs is necessary but not sufficient to thwart attacks
   on the routing table maintenance protocol. Tapestry and Pastry use
   overlay locality when constructing their rings, and are suspectible
   to attacks where malicious users lie about their proximity. Also,
   they are example of systems without strong contraints on the nodeIDs
   in the routing tables, and are thus suspectible to attack. The
   authors propose that a viable solution is to impose constraints on
   the routing table, or by having an additional routing table with heavy
   contraints (ala Chord).

3) Securely forward messages: When 1) and 2) are in effect, an attacker
   may still choose not to forward messages, and even when f is small,
   this attack is effective. This is prevented by applying a failure test
   to see if the messages was routed, and if not, use some redundant
   route. The paper then spends some pages on describing how a statistical
   failure test can be done efficiently, and conclude with a model where
   that the probability of a false positive is about 12% (when ignoring
   node suppression attacks). This section needs some more subsequent work.
   Next, the paper describes how redundant routing can be done as they
   address the problem of ensuring the routes are diverse. The describe
   a technique called neighbour set anycast where "copies of a message are
   sent towards the destination key until you reach a node that has the
   key's root in its neighbour set. It then uses detailed knowledge that
   such a node has about the portion of the identifier space around
   the destination key to ensure that correct replica roots receive a
   copy of the message." Redundant routing is then compared with iterative
   routing where you iteratively look up the next hop in the routing table,
   keeping track of where you went, until you find the root of the destinatio
   key. It turns out that this is expensive. This section then concludes
   with performance analysis of redundant routing.
The article concludes with a description of self-certifying data (data
whose integrity can be verified by the client) to minimize the overhead
incurred by implementing the ideas above.

Paper 2 discusses the Sybil attack in which a potentially malicious user
forges multiple identities. The paper shows that for practical purposes,
it is impossible to determine if identities are distinct in a distributed
environment with no prior information available. The paper formalizes
this by modelling a generic distributed environment. It then proceeds to
show that for direct identity validation, a malicious user can counterfeit
a constant number of multiple identities even when severely resource
constrained, and that these identities must be verified simultaneously,
otherwise the number is unbounded. Larger scale networks exacerbate this
problem. For indirect validation (you accept entities that are accepted
by already accepted entities), a sufficiently large set of malicious
users can counterfeit an unbounded number of identities, and that
all entities in the system need to perform identity validations concurrently,
otherwise the each faulty entity can counterfeit a constant number of
multiple entities. Again, this problem grows as the system size increases.
The paper is brief, and does not go into full depth of the obstructive
power that malicious entities can have.

Paper 3 presents a so-called Eclipse attack which is a generalized
version of the Sybil attack. Here, malicious users can also attack the
routing table maintenance mechanism so that the number of nodes that the
attacker has full control over grows with time as maintenance messages
are infiltrated (this is what Paper 1 presented as one of the main
security problems in p2p networks). The authors propose a mechanism
called anonymous auditing (you don't know who is challenging you) that
attempts to bound the degrees of the nodes. They conclude by showing that
this line of defense is effective by providing some experimental results.
The authors identify some weaknesses of their approach, namely that the
ideal hacker mechanism need be identified, and that anonymous auditing
needs to be evolved.
