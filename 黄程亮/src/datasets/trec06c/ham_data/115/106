Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Mr. Kenneth Erabor, Personal Assistance (PA) to the late wife of the President of Nigeria,Mrs. Stella Obasanjo (First Lady, Federal Republic of Nigeria) who died in a Spanish hospital after complication from a surgery operation. You can confirm this from the website aired from the BBC.NEWS.

I will kindly and urgently beg for your help to immediately get the bonded funds we were to clear from the security firm based in Spain before her surgery that eventually resulted in her death on the 22nd of
October, 2005. The total amount of the funds is Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand 
Euro (Euro 6,500,000.00,). Please let me know what the funds can be invested in while in your care for profitable business ventures. I promise to give you 30% of the total sum. If you are 
interested please reply to my private email address immediately. Nobody knows about this business except myself, there is no risk involved.

Best regards,

Mr. Kenneth Erabor.
