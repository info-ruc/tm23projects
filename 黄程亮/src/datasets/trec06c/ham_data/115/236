The measurement study reports the characteristics of peers in the =
Napster and
Gnutella networks based on a pair of short traces.  They find there is a
significant discrepancy between the upstream bandwidth available to well
provisioned and poorly provisioned peers.  Another interesting =
observation is
that many peers are uncooperative, both by sharing no files and by
misreporting the type of connection they had (underreporting capacity to
discourage others from making requests).  There are several flaws with =
the
methodology of this study.  The Gnutella trace ran only 8 days and the
Napster trace ran only 4 days, which means that they have data only from =
a
short time period that may be non-representative or contain misleading =
trends
(for example weekday / weekend cycles will not be adequately captured).  =
For
the Napster trace, they gathered peers by seaching for popular files.  =
This
biases the data because (for example) it seems like people with =
collections
of rare things rather than popular ones are less likely to be free =
riders
(because they may well be the only source for the items they will be the
target of requests no matter what they report) and people who do not =
share at
all will not be captured (and they may be motivated to free ride by poor
connections).  Their technique for bottleneck bandwidth measurement =
raises
ethical issues.  Even if it is only done for a short time, it appears =
they
are essentially launching a DoS attack on the person's connection for =
that
time.  In 3.3.3, their explanation of a disproportionate percentage of
downloads by low bandiwdth peers does not make sense.  They claim that =
low
bandwidth peers tend to be free riders and this explains why they make =
more
than their share of downloads.  However, there doesn't seem to be any =
reason
why the number of uploads provided should have any influence on the =
desire
for downloads of these peers.  If anything it would seem that they =
should be
consuming less because it takes longer for them to complete a given =
download.
Finally, their numbers for the removal of nodes from Gnutella have an =
error
somewhere.  They claim they removed 30% of 1771 and left 1300, but 70% =
of
1771 is 1240, which even if rounded is closer to 1200.

The workload study reports the results of a 200 day trace of requests =
made by
users at the University of Washington on the Kazaa network and some
simulations based on this workload.  The most interesting result of the =
trace
is that the distribution of requests for large media files is not Zipf, =
a
fact that they are able to explain by the fact that files a requested =
once
rather than repeatedly as web pages are.  They draw a distinction =
between two
main classes of files on Kazaa: small files < 10 MB (typically music) =
and
large files > 100 MB (typically movies).  Most requests are from the =
former
but most bandwidth is used by the later.  This means that to optimize =
user
experience a system should focus on the former while to optimize =
bandwidth
use it should focus on the latter.  They also propose and simulate a =
system
for decreasing the bandwidth used by a file sharing system for a =
community
sharing an external connection (for example a university).  They dismiss
caching because of potential policy and legal issues.  Instead they =
propose
directing requests to internal peers whenever possible, effectively =
using
them as a distributed local cache.  Their simulations suggest that this =
can
make a significant difference in external bandwidth consumption.
