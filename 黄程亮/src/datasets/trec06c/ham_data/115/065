Subject: Urgent - strike dates called

Dear colleague,

Last week's ballot result was clearly a surprise to the employers.  Despite
an unprecedented propaganda assault aimed at persuading members not to
support the union, we received strong majorities in support of both strike
action and action short of a strike.  The same was true of the ballot
result of our colleagues at NATFHE.  Full details of the results can be
found here http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1522

The officers of AUT have now met and we are asking AUT members to:

  * take strike action on Tuesday 7 March 2006; and
  * action short of a strike including an assessment boycott on Wednesday 8
March 2006 and until further notice

NATFHE members will be asked to do the same.

We have produced guidance on what action short of a strike means and you
can download it here: http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1523

Speaking today after the decision of AUT and NATFHE to take industrial
action forward, AUT general secretary Sally Hunt said:

"Our decision to take industrial action has not been taken lightly. The
employers have had months to stop this happening and even after our
resounding mandate from members they still haven't made us a pay offer. I
am extremely saddened that it has got this far and can fully understand the
fears and frustration of students and their parents. How the employers can
claim their staff and their students are so important to them and then
treat both so shabbily is beyond me. The universities are gambling
disgracefully with students' futures and I would ask them to think again
and at last offer serious negotiations without pre-conditions.

For our part AUT and NATFHE are committed to a negotiated solution.  If the
employers do now finally actually come up with an offer that meets our
claim there will be no need for industrial action."

Given their initial response however we need to plan to make the action as
effective as possible, and we need your help as an AUT member.  Now that we
have a democratic decision the union will be asking all members to
participate in the action that begins on the 7th.  The more effective it
is, the more likely we are to get an offer that reflects your worth -- but
you can help us still further by:

  * Turning up to picket on 7 March
  * Offering help in the campaign to your local association
  * Supporting fully the action short of a strike, including the boycott of
assessment
* Writing to local and national papers and explaining to
students our case

Support for our case is already building up.  Only yesterday the Observer
in an Editorial described academic pay as "appalling".  If you want to read
more about what the media are saying go to our media digest at
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1526

Over the coming days we will be providing you with plenty of resources to
help you play your part. It is your union and your pay and future pension
we are fighting for so please get involved.

  * GET BEHIND YOUR UNION
  * SUPPORT THE STRIKE ON 7 MARCH
  * SUPPORT THE ACTION SHORT OF A STRIKE FROM 8 MARCH

All/Best

Matt Waddup, ags
