Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to you on behalf of the Romanian Cultural Institute, Bucharest=
.
One of our purposes here is making Romanian literature known abroad,
particularly in English-speaking countries. As part of this programme, our
Institute is offering a three-month grant for (native) English-speaking
translators with a fair knowledge of Romanian. They will be invited to
Romania and given the possibility to know the country, its language, and it=
s
culture in greater detail. At the same time they will be involved in
concrete translation projects together with Romanian authors and
translators, and given the opportunity to improve their Romanian with the
support of the teaching staff at Bucharest University.

Candidates can choose between the periods April-June and September-December
for their Romanian sojourn. During this time, they will receive free
accommodation and breakfast at Palace Mogosoaia, just outside Bucharest, an=
d
Euro 500 per month, plus another five hundred towards transportation costs.
Ideally, they should be expected to develop and maintain an interest in
translating Romanian literature into English and, to this end, keep in touc=
h
with the Institute. They will be welcomed to return in order to pursue any
relevant projects they embark upon. Further information is available on our
website: www.icr.ro.

 Since native English speakers with a working knowledge of Romanian and the
willingness to develop it with a view to making Romanian literature known
abroad are difficult to find, I'd greatly appreciate any suggestions you
might have as to where we could start looking for eligible candidates. In
case you happen to have concrete suggestions, we'll be only too glad to
consider them.

Hoping to hear from you soon, I remain

Yours faithfully,

Florin Bican
