The Sybil Attack presents a class of attacks on P2P systems based on an
attacker obtaining multiple identities.  The first attack is that a well
provisioned entity can exploit the fact that he has a multiple of the
resources of a minimally provisioned entity to appear as multiple =
minimal
entities.  It identities are not verfied directly, and are instead =
verified
by having a certain number of established entities vote to accept them, =
an
attacker with sufficient resources to establish a voting block of the
required size can create an unlimited number of identities.  Finally, in =
both
cases, if identities are not all verified at the same time, even a =
minimal
entity can sequentially create an unlimited number of identities.  One =
factor
that seems to be overlooked is that no additional work is required to =
provide
a cost for maintaining multiple identities.  The costs of overlay
maintainance and routing may, in many systems, provide enough of a cost =
to
keep the number of potential sybils small.

Secure Routing for Structured Peer-to-Peer Overlay Networks presents a
variety of techniques for securing overlays against malicious nodes.  =
The
property that they seek to provide is: "when a non-faulty node sends a
message to a key k, the message reaches all non-faulty members in the =
set of
replica roots R_k [i.e. those nodes storing a copy of the object with =
key
k]with very high probability."  To provide this guarantee, they examine =
ways
to provide three lower level properties.  The first is that the =
assignment of
nodeIDs is secure.  They propose using real world certification of =
nodeIDs to
make difficult or prevent obtaining multiple or carefully chosed IDs.  =
They
reject distributed solutions on the grounds that none they are aware of
prevent obtaining a large collection of IDs over time.  To ensure =
attackers
cannot hijack the routing table, they propose constraining the routing =
table
so that only a single node can fill any slot (as in chord).  This =
prevents an
attacker from being able to fill a large number of slots with a small =
number
of nodes and also ensures that filling any chosen slot with a random =
nodeID
is unlikely.  Finally, they examine ways to ensure that messages are
delivered even if some nodes along the path are faulty.  Their proposal =
is to
use redundant paths to ensure that a single node can not prevent any =
pair
from communicating.

Eclipse attacks proposes a different solution to this same problem.  By
bounding the indegree of nodes, it prevents a small group of nodes from
altering the routing tables so that a large fraction of messages must =
pass
through them.  This presents a new problem because now a small group of =
nodes
can take up the entire indegree of a large group of nodes, cutting them =
out.
To prevent this, the outdegree must also be bounded.  An auditing scheme =
is
used to enforce these bounds.  Another possibility these papers could =
have
considered is an expander graph type structure.  The fact that the
neighborhood of a node grows exponentially fast may be sufficient to =
provide
the diversity of paths needed to prevent a small set of nodes from
controlling routing.
