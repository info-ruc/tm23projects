The Sybil Attack

The paper is claiming that a sufficiently recourseful attacker can grab 
a large part of a peep-to-peer network by simulating a sifficient number 
of identities, which reduces the resilience of the network due to 
redundancy. The problem posed is to ensure that distinct identities map 
to distinct identities. One way to do this is to issue challenges to 
each identity that will be difficult to respond to by a single entity at 
the same time. However, the challenges should be computationally 
feasible for the given time to the least resouceful correct node on the 
network, thus an attacker can claim as many identities and the floor of 
the ratio of its resourcefulness to this of the least capable correct node.

The other interesting proposition is that identity checking can be 
"outsourced" to formerly accepted identities. An identity is accepted 
only if it has been accepted by a certain number of already accepted 
nodes. However, once a correct node accepts the threshold number of 
faulty nodes the group of fauly nodes can make the correct node accept 
anything else.


Defending against Eclipse Atacks on Overlay Networks

An attacker on a overlay network can "eclipse" a certain set of nodes by 
controlling all links in and out of the set of nodes. The eclipse attack 
is more general than the sybil attack. The main idea here is that the 
degree of correct nodes is going to be within certain bounds compared to 
that of faulty nodes. Bounding the degree will alleviate the strength of 
the attack.

To do this nodes keep asymentric key paris to encrypt and sign messages. 
Nodes also keep a "back pointer" list, which is the set of nodes that 
have that node as a neightbor. The size of that list should be between 
the stipulated bounds. The list is verified by asking the its members 
directly. A node whose degree bounds are out of range is ignored.

This approach makes rounting slower since messages need to be 
signed/encrypted at each hop. However, that may be a small price to pay 
since the eclipse attacks are very effective and the results show that 
the approach is reasonably effective.
