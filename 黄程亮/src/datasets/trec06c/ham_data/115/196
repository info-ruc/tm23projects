A MEASUREMENT ..

Peer-to-peer systems are designed under the notion that all peers are
symmetric with respect to resource availability and consumption. However,
empirical studies have proved this idea wrong and suggest that a peer must
be assigned a task taking into account the abilities of the peer.

the authors discuss the architecture of Napster and Gnutella and use
crawlers to measure a number of parameters which result in the following
observations:
1) peers have an incentive to report lower bandwidths than they have.
2) number of "free-riders" in both systems is more than 20%

3) Napster peers tend to participate in the system more often than
Gnutella peers probably due to better application features.

4) Peers that report uniform bandwidths are uniformly distributed across
the bandwidth population.

5) peers are heterogeneous with respect to many characteristics such as
Internet connection speed, latencies, lifetimes, shared data.

Thus, client-server like behavior is clearly identified in a good amount.

although the period over which the measurements were carried out was
small, the results should not differ much even for longer periods.



MEASUREMENT, MODELING ...

this paper compares peer-to-peer load (Kazaa) with Internet traffic.
it results in the following comparisons/observations :

1) Kazaa users display "fetch-at-most-once" behavior simply because
objects here are immutable. Web traffic display "fetch-repeatedly"
behavior as objects here change constantly.Thus, Kazza does not display
zipf distribution especially with caching.


2) Kazaa traffic is due to the fact that new objects are inserted into the
system while web traffic is due to object updates.

3) kazaa users are more patient. the suggested reason is that it is a
batch-mode delivery system where downloads are made in the background
while the web is an interactive system where immediate responses are
required (resulting in impatient behavior)

the average session length in Kazaa was smaller than the median time
required to download a small object. This hints that
1) many transactions fail
2) a client may not end up finding a server for a object resulting in
periods of no-activity



the number of requests to small objects is huge compared to the other
objects requested while the majority of bytes transferred are due to large
objects. Thus, if our concern is bandwidth consumption then we must pay
attention to the small number of requests to large objects but if our
concern is to improve overall user experience then we must pay attention
to the large number of small object requests.

locality awareness would result in much better performance in Kazaa.
