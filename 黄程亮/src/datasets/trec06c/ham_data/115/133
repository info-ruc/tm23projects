Hi fine-grain parallelism seminar,

Please make a note of the following important information:

We'll be in ACES 3.408 starting this week.  If you know of auditors
who aren't on the email list please let them know too.

We are getting a special-case deal on this.  The new room will 
*not* be posted on the web page, so please make a note of it.
Also, please don't mention it to anyone who isn't attending the class.
If our new location "leaks", we might have to go back to the room with
the elevator noises.

On two days we will have other rooms:
April 6, ACES 3.116
April 27, ACES 2.404b

Please make a note of these as well.

Bill
