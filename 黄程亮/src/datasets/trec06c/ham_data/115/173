arXiv Founder Paul Ginsparg Named
Recipient of Paul Evan Peters Award

Paul Ginsparg, physicist and Internet scholarly communications pioneer, is 
the latest recipient of the Paul Evan Peters Award, announced today by the 
Coalition for Networked Information (CNI), the Association of Research 
Libraries (ARL), and EDUCAUSE.  The award will be presented on April 3, 
2006 at the CNI Membership Meeting in Arlington, VA, where Ginsparg will 
deliver the Paul Peters Award lecture at the opening plenary.  A professor 
of physics, computing and information science at Cornell University, 
Ginsparg has distinguished himself as the visionary behind arXiv 
(http://arxiv.org), an Internet e-print archive for articles in the 
sciences, which allows scholars to circulate and comment on research prior 
to publication in traditional peer-reviewed journals, thereby significantly 
reducing the amount of time it takes for an article to be available to 
researchers.  Started in 1991 as a service for preprints in physics, arXiv 
eventually expanded to include mathematics, computer science and 
quantitative biology.  Today, the resource boasts open access to over 
350,000 articles.

"Paul Ginsparg's accomplishments as a theoretical physicist, alone, 
distinguish him as a superb scholar, but his innovations in scientific 
publication, for which the Paul Evan Peters award honors him, truly places 
him in the annals of history as a transformative figure who has changed the 
landscape of scholarly communication forever," remarked Ronald Larsen, Dean 
of the School of Information Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh and a 
member of the award search committee. "This is a richly deserved award," 
Larsen continued, "that honors the legacy of Paul Evan Peters."

Commenting on how Ginsparg's brainchild has revolutionized science 
publishing, in the October 2005 issue of Sky & Telescope, author Richard 
Tresch Fienberg reports that papers published in more than a dozen major 
astronomy journals are twice as likely to be cited by other researchers if 
they have also appeared on arXiv.  He observes, "Clearly, professional 
astronomers are gravitating toward [arXiv] as their primary - perhaps even 
exclusive - reference source."  Expressing this view directly as part of 
the 2001 UNESCO Expert Conference Electronic Publishing in Science, 
Ginsparg wrote, "The essential question for 'Electronic Publishing in 
Science' is how our scientific research communications infrastructure 
should be reconfigured to take maximal advantage of newly evolving 
electronic resources."

The award - named for CNI's founding director - recognizes Ginsparg as 
creative and innovative, capable of taking a fresh view of conventional 
models of exchange and collaboration, which, eventually, led to a 
groundbreaking approach to scholarly communication.  "Dr. Ginsparg has 
helped to usher in an extraordinary new era in scholarly communication.  I 
am delighted that he has been selected to receive the Paul Evan Peters 
Award - his contributions clearly illustrate the spirit of this award, " 
said Duane Webster, ARL Executive Director.

In 2002, Ginsparg was named a fellow of the John D. and Catherine T. 
MacArthur Foundation.  Upon announcing the award, the foundation stated 
that, "Ginsparg has deliberately transformed the way physics gets done - 
challenging conventional standards for review and communication of research 
and thereby changing the speed and mode of dissemination of scientific 
advances."

Commenting on the impact Ginsparg's work has had on scholarly 
communication, CNI Executive Director Clifford Lynch said, "Paul's work has 
shown how technology can fundamentally change the patterns of flow and the 
pace of scientific communication and has challenged scholarly disciplines 
to reconsider their practices."

Ginsparg joins previous award recipients Brewster Kahle (2004), Vinton Cerf 
(2002) and Tim Berners-Lee (2000).

Three nonprofit organizations, the Coalition for Networked Information, the 
Association of Research Libraries, and EDUCAUSE, sponsor the Paul Evan 
Peters Award, which was established with additional funding from Microsoft 
and Xerox Corporations.  The award honors the memory and accomplishments of 
Paul Evan Peters (1947-1996).  Peters was a visionary and a coalition 
builder in higher education and the world of scholarly communication.  He 
led CNI from its founding in 1990 with informed insight, exuberant 
direction, eloquence, and awareness of the needs of its varied 
constituencies of librarians, technologists, publishers, and others in the 
digital world.

CNI is a coalition of some 200 member institutions dedicated to supporting 
the transformative promise of networked information technology for the 
advancement of scholarly communication and the enrichment of intellectual 
productivity.  ARL's membership includes the leading research libraries in 
North America.  Its mission is to shape and influence forces affecting the 
future of research libraries in the process of scholarly communication, 
promoting equitable access to and effective use of recorded knowledge in 
support of teaching, research, scholarship, and community 
service.  EDUCAUSE is an association of nearly 1,900 colleges, 
universities, and education organizations whose mission is to advance 
higher education by promoting the intelligent use of information technology.
