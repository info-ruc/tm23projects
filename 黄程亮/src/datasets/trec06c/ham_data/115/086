Sybil:
         A Sybil attack is when a given principal acquires many different 
IDs, in order to take control of a disproportionate fraction of the 
network, to do damage.  A Sybil attack, properly defined, is a building 
block of some other attack.  In order to prove strong security properties, 
it would be very nice to be able to show that distinct machines in a P2P 
network are owned by different principals.  Alas, the central result of 
this paper is that there are no good strategies for limiting Sybil 
attacks.  In particular, techniques for directly proving that two hosts are 
distinct via network have an error margin proportional to the difference in 
resources between a "powerful" host and a "weak" one.  Different hosts must 
be tested simultaneously, rendering distributed challenges 
difficult.  Vouching schemes are also problematic.
         The Sybil paper unfortunately does a fairly shallow analysis.  It 
implicitly assumes that all authentication must be done across the network, 
through messages.  It assumes that every malicious node has a valid 
identity.  It implicitly assumes that identities are either accepted or 
not, with no middle ground.



Eclipse:
         In an eclipse attack, the attacker attempts to inject faulty nodes 
into every entry in the target host's routing table, with an eye to 
preventing proper overlay operations. In the end, the target host may have 
all its network operations mediated through hostile nodes.  To make this 
attack harder, the authors propose to limit the degree of nodes in the 
overlay network.  They propose a protocol for this, in which nodes can 
anonymously query their neighbors to verify that their neighbor's table 
includes them, and has a legal degree.  If not, then that neighbor is dropped.
         This defense is only partial.  The anonymous query protocol 
proposed has a number of weaknesses.  If an attacker controls a node and 
its entire anonymity set, the protocol fails.  An attacker can also cause 
innocent nodes to be marked as suspicious by falsifying their 
responses.  And even if the protocol works properly, an attacker's fraction 
of routing table entries can still be substantially higher than their 
fraction of overall nodes.


Secure routing on structured overlays:

         This paper proposes a general scheme for reliable delivery of 
messages on peer-to-peer networks, in the presence of malicious 
nodes.  Messages are sent redundantly, to each of several root nodes for a 
given object.  The authors propose to use two routing tables, one optimized 
for speed, the other constrained deterministically to limit an attacker's 
flexibility.  This does allow something otherwise impossible--very reliable 
behavior, with a substantial fraction of the network compromised.
         The protocol fails when more than around 25% of nodes are 
compromised.  When it does work, the proposed protocol is quite expensive, 
with substantial time and message cost; an attacker can easily force it 
every time, which would significantly degrade the network.  Another 
weakness is that the paper does not offer suggestions for cheaper protocols 
when the threat level is less severe.
