<A Measurement Study...>

This paper starts from the premise that p2p systems should take under 
consideration the characteristics of the peers that participate in the 
system, reports on measurements of bottleneck bandwidth, latency, 
availability and file sharing patterns of peers performed by crawling 
the Napster and Gnutella networks, and conclude by providing 
recommendations to p2p systems designers. The study showed that most of 
the users are behind modest bandwidth connections and have asymmetric 
connections with higher downstream then upstream capacity. Moreover the 
study revealed that peers tend to misreport their bandwidth capacity in 
order to avoid upstream bandwidth consumption, they are not willing to 
cooperate and the systems provide  no incentives for them to do so to 
the point where 25% of the peers are free-riders. Another key 
observation is that even if designed with symmetry in mind, there is a 
large discrepancy between the peers. The authors propose that effective 
delegation  of responsibility should take under consideration accurate 
characteristics of the peers for the whole system to perform better.

<Measurement, Modeling, Analysis...>

The second paper reports on a measurement study that was performed 
against the Kazaa p2p system over a period of 200 days. The most notable 
observation is the fact that Kazaa shared file distribution, unlike the 
web, does not obey a power law. This is attributed to the immutable, 
fetch-it-once nature of the relatively large files (objects) shared. 
Popularity of objects decreases as they get to be downloaded more, since 
there's no reason to get the same file multiple times, yet this 
phenomenon is counter-balanced to some extent by the injection of new 
files in the system. New nodes joining do not have the same effect 
however, since they cannot counteract the penalty incurred by aging -- 
as Kazaa clients age they demand less from the system. The paper also 
shows that even if the popularity distribution is not bound by a power 
law there exists enough locality in the workload for caching to reduce 
the bandwidth consumption.
