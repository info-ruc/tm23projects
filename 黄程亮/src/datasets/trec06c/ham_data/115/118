	The first paper, "Sybil Attack," describes an attack where one faulty
entity creates multiple entities in the overlay network. Using multiple
identities in the network, one faulty entity can control a large portion of
the overlay network and undermine its function. One way to solve such a
problem is to use centralized trusted authorities to sign certificate for
each entity. The paper claims that the system without a trusted authority is
not practical to use resource-demanding challenges, such as computation,
storage or communication challenges, to validate one's identity because node
needs to send out challenges concurrently and it assumes the system has
uniform resource constraints. Also, if we indirectly validate entities using
vouchers, the number of vouchers has to be greater than the number of faulty
nodes. As system scales to larger size, it is not feasible to use such a
technique to verify node's identity to prevent Sybil Attack. 
	The second paper, "Defending against Eclipse attacks on overlay
networks," presents a more general attack which controls a large fraction of
the neighbors' pointers of correct nodes. Defense for Sybil attack may not
work for Eclipse Attack, because faulty nodes can manipulate the overlay
maintenance algorithm instead of presenting multiple identities to launch
Eclipse attack. In this paper, it presents a general technique by limiting
the in-degree and out-degree of a node to minimize Eclipse Attack on any
overlay network. Using such a technique, the overlay network does not require
any special structure in the overlay maintenance algorithm. To audit the
in-degree and out-degree of a node, each node needs to maintain a back
pointer list. Periodically, node sends out challenges to verify the in-degree
and out-degree of a node. Also, it also needs to implement an anonymous
channel such that nodes do not know who challenges the node and the reply
only comes from challenged node. Using such a defense, the construction of
overlay network is more constrained and optimization, such as PNS, does not
perform as well in such a constrained network (because it has fewer neighbors
to pick from).
	The third paper, "Secure routing for structured peer-to-peer overlay
networks," presents techniques to provide security in structured overlay
network. It describes three major components in secure routing, which include
a secure assignment of node identifiers, secure routing table maintenance,
and secure message forwarding. In secure assignment of node id, it uses
certified node id to against Sybil Attack. For secure routing table
maintenance, it uses two routing tables, one normal pastry table and another
constrained version of pastry table, which points to the closest node Id in
id space instead of using proximity metric. For secure message forwarding, it
uses routing failure test by comparing the densities of nodes to test if the
root is likely to be correct for the key. If the test returns negative, it
will uses redundant routing to route to the correct node.
