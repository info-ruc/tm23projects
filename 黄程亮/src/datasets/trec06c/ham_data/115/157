Davis and Diane Grover Appointed ARL Visiting Program Officers to
Extend ARL/DLF Partnership to Develop License-Mapping Training </strong></font></h2>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Washington,
DC&#8212;Trisha L. Davis, Associate Professor and Head, Serials and
Electronic Resources Department, Ohio State University Libraries, and
Diane Grover, Electronic Resources Coordinator, University of
Washington Libraries, have been appointed Visiting Program Officers
(VPOs) by the Association of Research Libraries (ARL). Their portfolio
at ARL is to refine and extend the benefits of a pilot workshop on
analyzing and mapping license terms for use in electronic resource
management (ERM) systems.&nbsp; The pilot workshop was sponsored by ARL and
the Digital Library Federation (DLF) and presented as a preconference
program at the 2005 ALA Annual Conference (see <a
 href="http://www.arl.org/stats/work/mapping.html">http://www.arl.org/stats/work/mapping.html</a>).&nbsp;
The &#8221;mapping&#8221; of license terms refers to the process of summarizing
information contained in license agreements for use within the
electronic resource management systems that many libraries now use.<br>
      <br>
Development of this important new area of professional practice is one
of a number of efforts within ARL, DLF, and the larger library
community to establish effective practices for managing electronic
resources.&nbsp; For example, ARL began offering its highly successful
licensing workshops in 1997 and, more recently, has spearheaded efforts
to develop measures of electronic resources in the statistics and
assessment area.&nbsp; The DLF&#8217;s Electronic Resource Management Initiative
(ERMI) is aimed at fostering &#8220;the rapid development of improved tools
for managing licensed electronic resources&#8212;whether by individual
libraries, consortia, or vendors&#8221; (see <a
 href="http://www.diglib.org/standards/dlf-erm02.htm">http://www.diglib.org/standards/dlf-erm02.htm</a>).&nbsp;
The work of ERMI has been received with enthusiasm by the library
community and has been swiftly adopted by the large automation vendors
as they design their new ERM modules.&nbsp; License-mapping practice is
heavily reliant on the list of data elements developed as part of DLF
ERMI&#8217;s work.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Trisha
L. Davis has many years of experience in working with license language,
including a previous VPO assignment in 1997 with ARL&#8217;s Office of
Scholarly Communication to develop and deliver the ARL licensing
workshops. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Diane
Grover began her present position in 2001, following 20 years of
experience in serials and automated library systems.&nbsp; In 2002, Diane
served on a development team with Innovative Interfaces to design its
electronic resources module based on the DLF ERMI work, and later led
designated &#8221;development partner&#8221; libraries in mapping the DLF data
elements to the electronic resources module.&nbsp; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Coordinating
closely with the DLF ERMI steering committee that is working on the
data-standards issues and building on the pilot ARL/DLF license
language &#8220;mapping&#8221; workshop, Davis and Grover will develop course
materials and training opportunities to support the description and
sharing of license information.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">The
Association of Research Libraries (ARL) is a nonprofit organization of
123 research libraries in North America. Its mission is to influence
the changing environment of scholarly communication and the public
policies that affect research libraries and the communities they serve.
ARL pursues this mission by advancing the goals of its member research
libraries, providing leadership in public and information policy to the
scholarly and higher education communities, fostering the exchange of
ideas and expertise, and shaping a future environment that leverages
its interests with those of allied organizations. ARL is located on the
Web at <a href="http://www.arl.org/">http://www.arl.org/</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">The
Digital Library Federation (DLF) is an independent membership
organization of academic libraries and related organizations that
pioneer the use of electronic-information technologies to extend their
collections and services. Founded in 1995, DLF identifies standards and
best practices for digital collections and network access; coordinates
research and development in the libraries&#8217; use of technology; and
incubates projects and services that libraries need but cannot develop
individually. More information about DLF is available at <a
