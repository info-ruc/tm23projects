The Sybil Attack
Defending Against Eclipse Attacks on Overlay Networks
Secure Routing for Structured Peer-to-Peer Overlay Networks

The Sybil Attack describes an attack on a p2p network overlay where single
attackers can masquerade as numerous nodes on the network.  The attack is
on a network that does not have a central centralized trust verification
system, but that allows public key cryptography.  A simple generic model
of a p2p network was proposed.  The paper illustrates that even with
techniques such as testing resource metrics, the realities of a
heterogenous network and time coordination issues make it possible for a
single attacker to deal with the challenges that they are faced with and
to continue to masquerade.  Having indirect identity validation also
creates a problem as the attacker can basically vouch for itself through
it's multiple identities.

Eclipse attacks are somewhat similar to Sybil attacks, but more general. 
Essentially, the attacker uses either a Sybil attack or takes advantage of
structural features of an overlay network to "eclipse" nodes by taking
over their neighborhood and not allowing messages to pass to or from the
target node.  Unstructured overlays, such as Gnutella, are shown to be
most vulnerable to such attacks because there are no constraints on a
node's neighbor set.  Though structured overlays can be somewhat more
resilient to these attacks, they are not invulnerable.  The paper proposes
a method of degree bounding to combat eclipse attacks.  In and out degrees
bounds are audited anonymously in order to avoid falsified answers.

The Secure Routing paper deals with a ensuring that messages are passed
correctly in a structured p2p network even in the presence of malicious
nodes.  The paper first stipulates that the network must have secure
nodeId assignment, and proposes that this is done with trusted
certification authorities.  The paper rejects the notion of distributed
nodeId generation saying that there are fundamental security limitations
in this scheme.  The paper also mentions a need to maintain secure routing
tables where invalid entries in tables are kept bounded.  The paper
proposes that two routing tables are maintained, one that constrains table
entries and one that is based on efficient routing.  Finally, the paper
wants secure message forwarding.  The solution is to be able to detect
faults and to have redundant paths to forward messages.  The general basis
of the routing failure test that is provided compares nodeId densities
around a sender and replica roots of the destination key (the example
provided is for Pastry.)  In the event of a detected error, messages are
forwarded through redundant routes.  The paper selects this method for
seucure message forwarding over a technique of checked iterative routing.

The Sybil Attack paper's general and somewhat simple network view may
limit their ability to analyze solutions that, while perhaps not perfect,
may alleviate this problem.  Some techniques have been proposed for
dealing with Sybil attacks in sensor and wireless networks where resource
constraints and characteristics are more clearly defined (e.g. radio
resource testing and random key predistribution).  There are some
unanswered issues in the Eclipse paper, particularly related to techniques
that would work on an unstructured network, but this is mentioned by the
authors as they have only presented a work in progress.  There does seem
to be a bit of strain put on the system from their defense method, and the
audits could become a little more difficult to handle in a network with a
lot of churn.  The Secure Routing paper seems to be limited since one of
the cornerstones of their approach is having secure nodeIds.  They base
this on having certification authorities, but it is not clear that this
system is feasible for all kinds of p2p networks, as was illustrated in
the Sybil Attack paper.
