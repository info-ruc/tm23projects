A measurement study of peer-to-peer filesharing systems

         It would be nice to know what the 'typical' napster or gnutella 
node looks like, and the authors set out to measure this.  They built a 
small toolbox of programs for measuring bandwidth, latency, and so forth 
for a large sample of napster and gnutella nodes, over a short period of 
time (4-8 days).  The authors show that nodes are very diverse, in terms of 
bandwidth, uptime, latency, and files shared.  They provide detailed 
numeric data on each.  For instance, they show that the bulk of nodes on 
both systems are users connecting through cable modems and DSL links, but 
that there are sizeable fractions of LAN users, and even of modems.
         Unfortunately, precisely because of the short measurement period, 
the authors may not capture long-term, or even annual, variation in the 
properties of peer-to-peer networks.  These data are perhaps relevant for a 
year or two; as the overall demographics of the internet shift, it seems 
likely that these results are no longer directly applicable.  The paper's 
Figure 2 shows interesting diurnal variation; sadly, the authors do not 
indicate whether their data is measuring local time or GMT, making it much 
less useful.  The authors mention that other Gnutella clouds may exist; it 
would be interesting to know whether different clouds have different 
geographic distributions.


Measurement and modelling

         Whereas the previous study examined peer to peer hosts qua hosts, 
this study concentrates on the data being shared, and the users qua 
users.  The study looked just at the UW campus, and just at one P2P 
protocol; Kazaa.  The authors present population studies on object 
popularity, and how Kazaa users change their behavior over time.  There 
were a number of interesting results.  To give one: due to the fact that 
users generally download a given file only once, the distribution of 
requests is not zipfian--the most popular items are "clamped" in 
popularity, being requested less often than Zipf's law would suggest.  The 
authors use these results to propose a statistical model of user behavior 
and file choices.
         This study is quite narrow in both breadth and scope. It is 
limited to a few months, and to a heavily-networked university campus.  It 
is not obvious that the results generalize to other network settings, or 
even whether they are constant over time.  The authors assert that "fetch 
at most once" is a fundamentally different cause for non-zipfian 
distribution from web caching.  This is not necessarily true: the user's 
hard disk is essentially a very large cache for media files of interest to 
the user, who may play the same song or movie many times.  The fundamental 
phenomenon resulting in non-Zipf distribution here could plausibly be 
caching--whether the cache is shared or per-client is not fundamental for 
analyzing the distribution.
