Hello,

I can confirm that everything is running now.

There is this "-console" flag which made it possible to run the installer in
an interactive mode in the text-only environment.
"Console" mode:
LinuxCmapServer_v4.02_02-02-06.bin -i console"

After the installation I installed the CmapServer on a remote computer I use
for administration to install the AdminTools, too, because they are not
available as a single download, as Rodrigo mentioned. I was able to
administer the fresh installed CmapServer afterwards.

Thank you again for your fast and detailed help.
Kind Regards,
Johannes
