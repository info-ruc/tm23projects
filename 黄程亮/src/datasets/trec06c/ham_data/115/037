Thanks. I understand now why using <d 40> in parameter line leads to  
display errors when I use a timeout of 2000 ms. I just got confused  
by the effect of delay parameter because <d 40> in the parameter line  
leads to display errors while <delay 40> at the beginning of an item  
does not lead to display errors. Thus, delay in the parameter line  
and delay in an item are not the same. Also, I try to understand  
their effect on the total trial duration and the ISI.

Removing the <d> parameter from the parameter line makes the total  
trial duration 48 ticks longer, which is as far as I understand it  
due to the 'request scheduled' (DMDX housekeeping)? I don't want this  
because when I press a button the stimulus is not immediately removed  
from the screen (it takes 48 ticks).

I changed <d 40> to <d 0> and removed <delay 40>. As expected no  
display errors but the total trial duration is a few ticks longer  
than I expected.  I guess this is due to DMDX housekeeping. If I use  
the <delay 40> in an item my calculation of the total trial duration  
is correct. Thus, the DMDX housekeeping happens then within <delay 40>?

Thanks,

Walter
