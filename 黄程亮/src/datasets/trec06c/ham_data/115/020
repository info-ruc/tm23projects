   Yeah, you can't do that in DMDX.  Decisions made as the display is still 
active simply aren't possible.  Either change your paradigm so you can 
break it up into smaller segments, one per item that can have branching 
around the later segments/items if a response is made or live with the 
screen not clearing till the display is done.  No third options, sorry.
