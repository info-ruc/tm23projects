I am having a rash of input threads that fail to die
too ... oddly (?) enough, on the most pathetically
simple DMDX script ever to have been written:


<vm 1024 768 768 16 60> <dbc 000255000> <fd 1 > <id
mouse> <id QPIO12>  <nfb> 
0  <bmp -1> "pPASAT.bmp"  ; 
1000 l ;

... show a questionnaire on the screen (BMP), press
response switch to exit.

Like sand in ones socks, the error is mildly annoying,
but not at all fatal.

JCF, thanks for all your great work on DMDX!

   It's safe to ignore thread failing to die messages.
 Some machines seem 
to take forever to kill off threads that were doing
things that are part a 
job that was running, usually it's a video retrace
thread, this is the 
first instance of an input thread failing to die that
I recall.  Alas I 
never get to see such machines so never get to fully
investigate them but 
the work of running the item file and saving the data
has already been done 
so they are of no consequence.  If the thread was
responsible for saving 
data or some such thing there would be cause for
concern but no thread is 
so it's just a case of me religiously sticking error
messages around 
everything that possibly could fail and you having a
machine that for some 
reason takes forever to kill off threads.
