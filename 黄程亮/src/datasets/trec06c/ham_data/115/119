<The Sybil Attack>

The paper presents a type of attack (Sybil) upon large p2p systems, and 
argues that in the absence of a centralized authority this type of 
attacks are always possible. A Sybil attack unfolds when some entity is 
capable of forging multiple identities, thus the rest of the peers are 
oblivious to the fact that a single entity is chosen instead of multiple 
distinct identities during the protocol. Such attacks are always 
possible since an entity can use all its available resources in 
projecting the image of several valid identities, and thus "convince" 
other entities. Moreover, if entities are not validated simultaneously, 
a large number of distinct identities can be presented, and thus the 
malicious node may grow its identity numbers indefinitely. Without a 
central identification authority, p2p systems are vulnerable to such 
attacks, therefore we see a tradeoff between scale and security on one 
side and heterogeneity and security on the other size - the latter is 
due to the fact that if all entities have virtually identical resources 
Sybil attacks are less disruptive.

<Defending against Eclipse attacks in overlay networks>

The paper discusses and proposes a solution to the Eclipse attacks on 
overlay networks. More general then the Sybil ones, the Eclipse attack 
is initiated by some attacker that controls a significant fraction of 
the nodes in the neighborhood of correct nodes, thus "eclipsing" the 
correct ones and preventing them to take part in the protocol. The 
defense against such an attack proposed by the authors consists of 
limiting the indegree and outdegree of the nodes. The reason behind this 
is that attacker nodes have a larger indegree since more nodes connect 
to the faulty ones as opposed to the eclipsed ones. Secondly, imposing 
just an indegree limit brings upon the possibility of a different 
attack, namely malicious nodes may consume all the incoming slots of 
correct nodes, therefore the limit must be imposed on the outdegree as 
well. The bounds are enforced by an auditing scheme, when the challenger 
is anonymous, thus forcing the challenged to respond correctly.

The downfall is that in structured networks an attacker can "guess" with 
high accuracy where the challenge originated from, therefore the 
auditing might be unsuccessful.

<Secure routing for structured peer-to-peer overlay networks>

The paper considers the general problem of security and how one can 
address it in the context of p2p overlays. First they abstract out the 
overlay networks and their properties such that there is no particular 
system they have in mind, even though their implementation was done on 
Pastry. They describe a series of attacks that can be performed and 
identify secure routing as the main building blocks that secure overlays 
can take advantage of. Secure routing is split into three subproblems: 
secure node ID assignment, secure routing table maintenance, and secure 
message forwarding. Secure node ID assignment requires the existence of 
a centralized CA (as we have seen proved by the first paper). Secure 
routing table maintenance is achieved by imposing stringent constrains 
on the routing table entries, and the fact that nodeID's have been 
assigned securely. Secure forwarding is a 2-phase operation, first a 
fault is detected - by means of a timeout or a failure test upon the 
replica roots, and second, if there was a failure then the message is 
resent but on multiple paths, hoping they are disjoint and thus at least 
one reaching the destination with high probability.

The experimental evaluation did not include the resource cost of the 
secure methods.
