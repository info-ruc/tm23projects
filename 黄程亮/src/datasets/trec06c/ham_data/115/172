The motivation behind both papers is similar. They want to develop 
insights and draw conclusions about peer-to-peer networks by looking 
directly at a real deployments like Napster, Gnutella and Kazaa. The 
authors claim that actual usage patterns, node characteristic and 
motivation for participation are very important and should be taken into 
consideration when making design choices about the system and the 
related protocols.

Measurement, Modeling and Analysis of a Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Workload

The paper focuses on the properties of the file-sharing phenomenon as 
delivered by the popular medium Kazaa. Through the data collected they 
make two important observations about the characteristics of users and 
demand.

-Unlike in the case of web site or DNS, popularity for large multimedia 
files does not follow a Zipf distribution. This is due to what they call 
"fetch-at-most-once" behavior, where the mutimedia files are requested 
once becase of their immutability (in contrast to web sites). Similarly, 
movie rentals and theater visits are actions committed once per object. 
The popularity graph of such objects has a "flat head", when drawn or a 
log-log scale.

-The primary forces in Kazaa are the creation of new objects and 
addition of new users. This is in contrast to the WWW, where constant 
mutation of objects generates the traffic. Users in Kazaa are "patient". 
Kazaa is a batch-mode delivery system as opposed to the "interactive" 
web. Also, the number of user requests tend to go down as the users "age".


A Measurement Study of Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Systems

This paper focuses more strictly to the profile of the users with 
respect to the available bandwidth, latency, availability and degree of 
sharing. Not surprisingly, the authors find that there is a great 
heterogeneity there. Their second observation is that when peers have no 
incentives they tend to misreport information.

One problem is that the data shown seems like a too small sample -- only 
four and eight days, respectively for Napster and Gnutella. Since some 
of the authors are the same in the other paper, they seem to have 
learned a lesson.

The main problem that the paper is trying to deal with is the 
misrepresenting of the available bandwidth. There is no good solutions 
to that--users will always report what they have incentives to report. A 
good solution will be an incentive to report bandwidth correctly or to 
somehow measure it directly.

The paper shows interesting graphs regarding the resilience of 
Gnutella's connectivity. If random 30% of the nodes are removed the 
network will be still connected. However, if the top 4% high-degree 
nodes are removed, the network will be partitioned in a large number of 
small networks.
