A student asked me a question and I think it is important to share the

The issue of 'Solve' is a delicate one.  On the one hand, it is a
fairly useful thing to have when you have a white-box function.
On the other hand it is quite slow, taking several seconds to solve the 
the n>15 cases (assuming you know what to solve there) and over a minute
to do the n=20 case.  It altogether hangs when I do the n=25 case
  ??? Error using ==> solve
  Unable to find closed form solution.
and next year, if I teach this course, I will ask for a table up
to n=30.

Why is this?  Well, the nature of matlab's solve is that it is a
symbolic solver.  These are some of the nicer things to show up in the
world of mathematical software in the past decade.  I don't have anything
against them, but they are limited in many ways and poop out on fairly
complicated problems.

Anyone who does problem 2 right can trivially do it up to n=30.

The existence of good quality symbolic tools complicates this class
somewhat, because any time I give you a problem on a problem set which
is too toy-like, the symbolic solver will be able to do it for you,
giving you the impression that you are ready to handle non-toy-like
problems.  On the other hand, giving you non-toy-like problems on the
problem set would be extremely irritating for you and me, because of
all the effort we'd need to waste just to properly describe and code
F(x), when the problem is about F(x)=0.

Symbolic solvers are great at doing problem set problems.  But this
is not representative of their usefulness in real problems that you will
face later.  Don't use symbollic solvers in this course and we'll be
just fine.  Recall that the problem set isn't really about solving the
present problems.  It is about convincing me that you will be able to
solve the future problems.  Institute guidelines compel me to base your
grade on my assessment of your competence.  Even if Solve didn't poop
out, your use of it would not help me to assess your competence. 

That said, I can't sit over your shoulder and make sure you don't use
Solve or other tools as a crutch and then lie to me (at least one
student admitted to this last year).  I try to make the problems
non-toy-like enough to confound off-the-shelf tools, but new tools
appear every day and I am bound to lose in this arms race.  Be honest
with me, or hope that you can be convincing (doing it up to n=30 would
be pretty convincing).

I think that if you read my response about canned tools, you will
see that the use of a non-symbollic fzero will not demonstrate
to me your abilities.

What happens when you get hired by Apple to add a feature to the
iPod which involves solving some f(x)=0 equation? If all you have
demonstrated is that you can solve this equation if the iPod loads
MATLAB's fzero, then I'm not assured that you are competent
for this task.

To be clear, its not like you shouldn't use polyval and polyder if
you want (though I think they are getting in your way here).  These
are fairly simple things which are not relevant to the material
we're currently covering.  I hope you can see my point.

Finally, let me give you an leg up and tell you that
this approach will not produce accurate results for the largish
N.  E.g. even after you fix the bug that's in there right now,
which you really need to find, for N=15 you will obtain fewer
than 6 accurate digits.  I'll give you some of the correct digits
to help you debug your problems.
 N=15:  C=X.240XXXX75XXXXXXe-XX

That can be slippery.  If you show someone your numbers and
they copy you, it would look bad for both of you.  So I'd better
tell you.  The over all trend should be towards 0 with the each
successive C being about 3/10 of the preceeding C.

I also gave some digits for the n=15 case in that dialog about
solvers linked from the course webpage.
