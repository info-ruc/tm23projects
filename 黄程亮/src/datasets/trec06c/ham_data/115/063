    Kindest Attention:

My name is .Mr. Boulos Kasstrup I am a portuguese,  I have been diagnosed 
with  Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and 
right now I have  only about a few months to live, according to medical 
experts. I have not particularly  lived my life so well, as I never really 
cared for anyone (not even myself) but my  business. Though I am very rich, 
I was never generous, I was always hostile to people  and only focused on my 
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I  regret all this 
as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or  make 
all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to 
come  to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have 
lived it.

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and 
assets to  my immediate and extended family members as well as few close 
friends .I want God to  be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have 
decided to give alms to charity  organizations and those in Need, as I want 
this to be one of the last good deeds I do  on earth. So far, I have 
Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was  well. Now that 
my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I  
once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute 
the money  which I have there to charity organization in United States, 
Asia, Middle East &  Europe, they refused and kept the money to themselves.

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with 
what I have  left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is 
the huge cash deposit  in abroad bank of  Twenty Million United States 
Dollars ($20, 000, 000.00)   I will want you to  help me to withdraw this 
deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations and use it  to help those 
in Need.

N/B:Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami, 
Hurricane  Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to 
other Charity  Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and 
time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am 
using my Lap  Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to 
this e-mail if you are  interested in carrying out this assignment on my 
behalf. Send your response via e-mail  at: cmiec_company2004@myway.com

God be with you.

Mr. Boulos Kasstrup
