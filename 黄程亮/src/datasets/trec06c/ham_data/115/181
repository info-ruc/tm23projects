Two papers out of the University of Washington measure characteristics 
of early peer-to-peer file sharing systems to get a sense of traffic 
patterns and client behavior over time.  The first paper, by Saroiu, et 
al., studies Napster and Gnutella using crawlers to scour the networks 
for a interval of four to eight days.  The paper comes away with two 
major observations about large multimedia sharing p2p systems.  First, 
although such systems often assume homogeneity in clients' bandwidth, 
latency, and number of files shared, clients across the network often 
differ by three to five orders of magnitude on all those 
characteristics.  Second, to game the system, many clients seem to 
misreport information about themselves, such as connection speed.  By 
doing so, clients have less responsibility for uploading files, and can 
be "free riders," using the service to download files without 
reciprocating the favor.  Without auditing algorithms in place to 
prevent misrepresentation, approximately 25% of all Napster and Gnutella 
users are free riders.

The second paper, by Gummadi, et al., focuses on Kazaa, a later p2p 
multimedia-sharing system.  They tracked Kazaa traffic in and out of the 
University of Washington for a 200-day interval.  Much of this paper is 
dedicated to comparing query distributions in Kazaa versus the Web.  In 
particular, the paper shows that Kazaa queries do not follow a Zipf 
distribution as Web queries do.  The most popular files are not as 
popular as a Zipf distribution would predict, making the popularity 
function "flatten out" at the popular end.  The authors attribute this 
phenomenon to the "download once" model.  Since Kazaa distributes 
immutable multimedia objects, there is little reason to download the 
same file multiple times.  Contrast this with Web pages, which a client 
might check several times every day.  The authors also point out various 
other statistics about Kazaa users, such as their patience as compared 
with Web users, who often give up on downloading a Website after a 
matter of seconds.  Kazaa users treat the network as a "batch download" 
program, waiting hours of days before their requested downloads are 
complete.

Both papers note the heterogeneity among clients and nodes in the three 
studied p2p networks.  Because of the vast differences in machine 
capabilities and network conditions throughout the networks, newer 
systems have begun taking such conditions into account.  Peer-to-peer 
networks, however, despite their dominance on world-wide network 
traffic, are still not as well understood as traditional Web services.
