This week's papers (both written by the same group) attempt to  
direction to people creating P2P network applications through  
statistics gathered from real world cases.  The first paper uses  
Napster and Gnutella as case studies, while the second paper focuses  
on Kazaa.  The interesting conclusions, in no particular order are:
1) A large portion of P2P users use more system resources than they  
provide.
2) A small portion of P2P users provide a large portion of the  
resources available on the network.
3) People disable their P2P applications when they are not using them
4) While Gnutella is resilient in the face of most failures, there  
are a handful of nodes that act as key routers.  A concerted attack  
could cripple the Gnutella network.
5) Most files distributed by P2P applications do not follow a zipf  
distribution, as clients will only request them once.  Thus, an  
effective limit on download count is imposed.
6) Large objects represent the largest portion of P2P traffic,  
despite representing the smallest portion of P2P requests.  By  
comparison, small objects are requested frequently but represent only  
a small portion of the traffic.

Many of these points are facts that we take for granted nowadays.   
Particularly interested is the note about Gnutella's weaknesses.   
Their trace demonstrates a very strong tree-structure, though they  
neglect to show where their node is located.  Depending on how the  
search was conducted, it is possible that these graphs are not  
complete.  Gnutella's failure points may be artifacts of an  
incomplete perception of the entire state of the network, combined  
with a demi-deterministic random walk algorithm.  The second paper  
could have shown series of graphs demonstrating object downloads as a  
function of both time and rank.  One would expect to see a near-zipf  
distribution over a small window, turning into the graph they showed  
as the window increased.  Given the depth of their analysis,  
confirmation of this behavior would be a useful addition.
