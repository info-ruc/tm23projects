A Measurement Study of Peer-to-Peer File Sharing Systems
Measurement, Modeling, and Analysis of a Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Workload

Both of these papers deal with the issue of probing popular file-sharing
systems to try to derive some meaningful characteristics.  The first paper
set up crawlers for Napster and Gnutella.  Different findings were made
about bandwidth usage and the contribution of different nodes in the
networks.  It was found that nodes generally had lower upstream bandwidth
than downstream.  It was also found that there were many leechers on the
network.  Despite the appearance of a system where many nodes were each
carrying out similar responsibilities, the models of these systems seemed
to be much more like a modification on the traditional client server model
with much of the load borne by larger, more resourceful nodes with a
significantly smaller load on a large number of other nodes.  Gnutella
showed some resilience to failure, but it was shown that a coordinated
attack would be able to "shatter"; the system because of the uneven load
distribution.  It was also found that there is quite a bit of churn on
these systems, worse on Gnutella than on Napster.

The second paper considered measurements of Kazaa.  First, the authors
compared Kazaa usage to web usage.  They found that Kazaa users are
generally more patient than web users.  Also, Kazaa usage differs from web
usage because Kazaa users will often obtain an object only once from the
system, as opposed to a website that a user may visit many times due to
its changing nature.  Distribution of object popularity was also
considered.  It was shown to be non-Zipf, like websites, but the reasons
for the distribution were different between websites and Kazaa objects. 
Website distribution was driven by the nature of proxy caches, whereas
Kazaa doesn't really have a caching system like that.  The study also
showed that file-sharing effectiveness decreases with client age.  In
turn, this showed that the infusion of new objects rejuvenated the system.
 However, new clients joining the network did not have the same effect. 
The paper also looked at ways to improve performance, and showed that a
locality-aware mechanism may help to reduce bandwidth usage.

Both of these papers may not seem too ground breaking when considered in
retrospect, as some of the findings have now become somewhat commonly
known knowledge.  However, given the time when the measurements were made,
it was probably an important step to understanding such file-sharing
systems.  However, one of the drawbacks of these papers may be the
temporal nature, the papers do not look forward too much with respect to
changing Internet infrastructures, such as the recent development of
significantly higher speed networks in Europe and Asia, where bandwidths
may increase significantly and equalize in terms of up and downstream
capacity.
