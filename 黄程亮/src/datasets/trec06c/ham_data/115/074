    _The_Sybil_Attack_
    John R Douceur

    The essential point of this paper is a taunting one: to reduce loss due
to failure, redundancy can be employed; however, if the scenario involves a
malicious entity, then if they can leverage sufficient resources, they can
seize a considerable amount of control. The paper also proves that logicall=
y
centralized authorities can prevent Sybil attacks, but that otherwise,
extreme and unrealistic assumptions about attacker capabilities must be mad=
e
(and thus vulnerabilities introduced). The difficulty here lies that it is
not just redundancy which can be impacted by one attacker who can lay claim
to multiple identities -- in cases of data being split among several
entities, it can lead to data leakage; thus, the system must ensure that
distinct identities refer to distinct entities. The assumption on relative
resources (because, of course, with unbounded greater resources, an attacke=
r
can do nearly anything) is very weak: merely that there exists some n for
which all entities can perform operations which are polynomial in n, but no
entities can perform super-polynomial operations in n.
    The central concept was that the only way in-band to prove that two
entities are separate is for the two to perform some computation in time
that would tie up all of the resources of a single entity, and thus the
identities must belong to separate entities. However, even this is not good
enough, since it does not rule out collusion! Also, it assumes a certain
degree of homogeneity; the assumption is easily broken by a motivated
attacker, which is perhaps the threat model of every system. Once accepted,
the paper goes on to indicate that identities may be able (depending on
system) to vouch for other entities; thus the danger is that faulty entitie=
s
can (under the presented model) amplify their influence. The problem is wit=
h
the presented model of delegating identity verification: If we require not
just individuals vouching, but paths vouching, then we can detect whether
this attack is being used (or at least moderate the flow) based on the
presented path contianing duplicates.

    _Defending_Against_Eclipse_Attacks_on_Overlay_Networks_
    Atul Singh, Miguel Castro, Peter Druschel, Antony Rowstron

    In an overlay network, as the attacker compromises more and more nodes,
their influence grows superlinearly; specifically, if the attacker can
compromise a large fraction of the neighbors of a correct node, then they
may 'eclipse' that node, preventing correct operation. It may be launched
via a Sybil attack or via collusion, and is a higher order problem as
attackers may manipulate the overlay maintenance algorithm to mount the
Eclipse attack. The insight of the paper is that indegree of attacker nodes
is going to be greater than that of "honest" nodes, and thus bounding this
indegree mediates the attack, and to avoid the problem this creates by
bounding outdegree as well.
    The defense hinges on a solution to distributing node identifier, which
is not trivially solved, as the attacker cannot easily be prevented from
gathering multiple identities, merely slowed. The auditing method uses
source rewriting to have a set of nodes perform in- and out-degree queries
on behalf of other nodes on the network. Since there are a set of indirect
nodes, as long as we assume there are f failures and the set is of size
2*f+1, we can absolutely ensure correct behavior. This is polynomial in f,
but capable of growing quite large. Moreover, it uses only shallow source
re-writing, which means that a single compromised node can do significant
damage; in fairness, however, in the peer to peer domain it is difficult
enough to discover incorrect behavior, let alone absorb its damage
flawlessly.

    _Secure_Routing_For_Structured_Peer_to_Peer_Overlay_Networks_
    Miguel Castro, Peter Druschel, Ayalvadi Ganesh, Antony Rowstron, Dan S.
Wallach

    This paper explores some of the capabilities of incorrectly functioning
nodes in terms of message delivery through peer-to-peer overlays. They spli=
t
the weaknesses of peer to peer systems into three domains -- secure
identification, routing table maintenance, and message routing -- and
propose solutions for each vector of attack.
    Secure identification is in some senses a punted issue in this paper, a=
s
the solution is to require out-of-band verification of separate identities,
or a weaker guarantee than separate identities. The only "resource" which w=
e
can assume is equally shared between users, and no replicable due to
collusion, etc, is time; the paper proposes & rejects a cryptographic puzzl=
e
solution.
    Secure routing depends on good information which depends on secure
identities; thus the solution to one aids the solution to the other. Their
solution is to maintain, parallel to the optimized routing table, a second
routing table with constrained choices, making the attacker's chance of
having an entry in the table proportional to the number of nodes the
attacker controls (rather than much greater). This segment does not,
however, handle how to remove compromised nodes from the secure list, but
merely uses it as a backup.
    Finally, secure message passing relies on replicating messages; this is
a secure and inoffensive method of passing, though prevents information
loss, not information leakage.
