Someone has asked whether the study sheet can be typed or whether is 
must be handwritten.  You may type it - but please don't use a 
miniscule font or photoreduce it.  The goal is not to reproduce the 
entire textbook on a single sheet of paper, but instead to give you an 
opportunity to write down some notes and equations that may help jog 
your memory on the exam.

Cheers,
