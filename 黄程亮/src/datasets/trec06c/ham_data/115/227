That's a good question.  By the end of today's lecture we will
learn a 3rd form, the Newton form.  I'm happy with canonical,
Lagrange, or Newton form (with x's in the order given), but
simplify any constant coefficients in whichever you do and write
them to at least 7 digits.

I have removed the spline problem from the pset.  I won't cover
splines in as much depth as I had originally intended.
