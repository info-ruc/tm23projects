So far, all the peer-to-peer networks we've looked at have made some
general assumptions about the hosts which will be running the systems.
We've assumed that network bandwidth and latency were the limiting
factors, and not worried too much about CPU time or memory usage.
However, we had no idea how much bandwidth the average node had, or
how much this varied between nodes.  These papers study the
characteristics of the nodes running file-sharing software.

The paper by Saroiu et al. showed that the nodes in both Gnutella and
Napster were heterogeneous, with variations of several orders of
magnitude.  In addition, their work showed that nodes were likely to
misrepresent their characteristics, such as available bandwidth.
They also found that the 'free rider' problem from economics carries
over into peer-to-peer networks; a portion of the nodes in the system
only downloaded files, and never uploaded them.  Furthermore, 50% of
the sessions lasted less than 60 minutes, which gives us a value to
use for network churn. All of these facts suggest that the assumptions
made when creating and evaluating several popular peer-to-peer
networks were not correct.

The second paper by Gummadi et al. presents long-term study of the use
of the Kazaa peer-to-peer file sharing system.  They noted several
important facts about the characteristics of file-sharing networks.
For one thing, unlike web pages, objects in such a network will
generally be downloaded at most once by a single node. Kazaa users
were willing to wait for several days for a file to be downloaded,
making Kazaa more like a batch mode system.  There is also a potential
for significantly reduced bandwidth usage if caches or locality
awareness was used.

Both of these papers present the characteristics of nodes on a file
sharing network; they do not examine any other types of overlay
networks.  It has also been several years since these papers were
published, so the characteristics of nodes in a file-sharing network
may have changed over time.  The file-sharing networks have also
changed as a result of these studies; some networks require their
users to maintain a certain upload/download ratio, and there are
currently several projects which attempt to provide load balancing for
heterogeneous networks.
