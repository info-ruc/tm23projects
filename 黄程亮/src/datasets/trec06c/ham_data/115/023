Hi,
I have posted the class average for the homeworks online. You can find 
them in the "Solutions" sections through the following link:

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~skeckler/cs352/homework/hw.shtml

I understand the class average is not very high. I strongly recommend that 
you show all the formula and intermediate steps to get partial credits 
even if the final solution is not within error percentage. I have tried my 
best to accept range of solutions if it reflects understanding about the 
concepts and award more points to the approach than the final answer. 
Also, state your assumptions especially if you feel, the data given in 
the question is not sufficient. Catch me during your office hours if you 
don't understand why you have lost points so that you don't repeat it 
again in the exam.

Feel free to mail me if you want to know more statistics on the grades or 
if you other queries.

Thanks.
Madhavi
