ALPO 2006: Call for Papers!!!

The 2006 conference of the Association of Lunar & Planetary Observers 
will be held Thursday, Friday, Saturday, July 20, 21 and 22, in 
Atlanta, Georgia, specifically at the Fernbank Science Center.

Lodging for those arriving from out-of-town has been being arranged 
at nearby Emory University; attendees may also arrange for their own 
lodging elsewhere.

The primary purpose of this conference is for the presentation of 
papers which contain experimental results or current data on solar 
system astronomy.

This event is open to ALL. At this time the pre-registration fee is 
expected to be around $30, with the walk-in fee higher. Also, the 
final registration fees are subject to change as all event costs are 
ascertained; the Emory University lodging fees are expected to be 
somewhere near $30 per person.

Papers are sought for all areas of solar system astronomy. Topics of 
interest include, but are not limited to:
    * Recommended observing methods and techniques (elementary and 
advanced, traditional and new)
    * Interesting solar system object
    * Computer hardware/software to optimize solar system observing
    * Instrumentation used for lunar and planetary imaging, 
videography, or routine visual work
    * Historical observations of particular relevance
    * On-going and future opportunities for Pro-Am 
(professional-amateur) collaboration
    * Value of continued systematic, simultaneous lunar and planetary 
visual observations

Papers must be accompanied by an abstract of no more than 100 words. 
The abstracts should include
    * A description of the topic
    * The results or conclusions obtained
    * Additional background and other relevant information

Abstracts may also contain reference to supporting figures, tables, 
and other graphics. The abstract must include:
    * Paper title
    * Authors' names and affiliations
    * Address
    * Telephone number
    * Fax number
    * E-mail address

NO PAPER WILL BE CONSIDERED FOR PRESENTATION OR PUBLICATION THAT HAS 
BEEN PRESENTED OR PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE.

Two copies of the abstract as described above should be submitted to 
Ken Poshedly (address info in ALPO Resources section of this 
Journal). Deadline for submission of the abstract is June 15, 2006.

A special ALPO conference lunar & planetary imaging demo session will 
be held on Saturday morning of the conference. Led by ALPO member 
Larry Owens, the program will feature the use of the Registax 3.0 for 
stacking and preliminary processing of webcam-acquired images, along 
with post-processing techniques to use in your own graphics program 
(Adobe PhotoShop, Corel PhotoPaint, etc.).

Samples of Mr. Owens' work can be found on the World Wide Web 
at  http://www.atlantaastronomy.org/CEWMA/larry_owens_images.html
The Registax program itself is free and available at 
http://registax.astronomy.net/

Objects covered in the demo will include the Moon (between Last 
Quarter and New Moon at that time), as well as those planets up for 
nighttime viewing in mid-late July; this includes Venus, Mars, 
Jupiter, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto.

A free pdf version of Mr. Owens' presentation will be made available 
to all who attend this demo; even though tutorials are available 
online, the presence of other individuals who can assist with 
questions at the conference is a major advantage to this demo versus 
working through it on your own.

Registration materials will be available shortly in two ways:
    * On the ALPO website.
    * By a third-class mailing .
For more information, e-mail to poshedly@bellsouth.net
