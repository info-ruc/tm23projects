The solution is really simple.  All you have to do is run the power from 
the motor outputs to a relay.  This relay will activate another circuit 
(an automatic switch with power detected from motor outputs)which has 
your 12DC 4A motors AND it's own power source.

If you would like help with using a relay, just ask!
