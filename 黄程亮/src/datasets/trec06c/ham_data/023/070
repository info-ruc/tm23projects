1.  when you say "lights stay on," are you specifically referring to
the SER and PWR LEDs by the two buttons?  because the motor LEDs may
be on or off, it doesn't matter, before the bootstrap download.

2.  assuming yes, you are talking about SER and PWR, what happens when
you unplug the board from your computer entirely?  do they go off when
wehn you turn the board on?  if so, then you may have a problem with
the cabling, either from your computer to the serial interface board,
or the RJ11 cable from the serial interface to the handy board.  in
this case (lights go off properly when HB disconnected, but not when
cabled up to computer) it's also possible that the MAX232 chip on the
serial interface has failed.
