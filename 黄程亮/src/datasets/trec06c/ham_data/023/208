I was wondering if anybody knows how data is transfered through the RJ 11
modem cable to the Handyboard (i.e. the pin layout). My intention is to use
this information to look for/ design a wireless link.
Also, I would like to know if anyone has used, or if it is possible to use,
the Infrared input/ output for this purpose.
