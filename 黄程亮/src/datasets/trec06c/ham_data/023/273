hi, 
I'm doing a robot to navigate it to a destination that needed to avoid
obstacle collision
along the way. Besides, I intend to use 2 dc motor ( 12v ,0.9Nm, 310mA
rating) for the 2 wheels and include the encoder too. Should I use stepper
for such robot application ?
Which is easy to write the alogrithm ?

Moreover, My robot has to navigate with the boundary of 5metres square ? 

Please advice .

rgds,
chia
