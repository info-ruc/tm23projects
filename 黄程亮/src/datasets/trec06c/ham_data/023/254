The PLCC version of the 68HC11 is the one that you want. The part number
from R.S. is 265-853 and in the July 97 - October 97 catalog it cost
7.50 pounds + VAT. This price has no doubt increased but the stock
number should be correct.
The 32K RAM I found in Maplins (code UH40T price 4.99 pounds inc. VAT
this price was from about Feb 98).

If you have managed to get all the other parts from Farnell and R.S.
would it be possible to have a list of the parts with associated stock
numbers and prices.

I hope this helps.
