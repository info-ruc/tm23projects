Hi all,

I just read a great article from Karl Lunt in a robotics magazine about
beginning programming (exactly where I am) and the 68HC11.

He mentioned that he has a basic compiler that you can download from his site.
Does anyone know if this will work with the HandyBoard?  How well does it
work?

Thanks,
Gerald
