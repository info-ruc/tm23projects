Dear hb-fans,

	I'm currently trying to use the handy board to run a 12-legged
robot. I've tried to power the motors directly from the hb motor output
but apparently the current supplied is too low. 

	Is there any simple method of powering my motor and at the same
time allows me to control the power level via the handy board?

regards,
keong ;-)
