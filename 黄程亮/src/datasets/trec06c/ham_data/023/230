Dave,
    I have been doing radio communications between my HB and a remote sensor
but I am sure you could use the same radios for communicating with a PC at
up to 2400 bps. I have been using an Elsema transceiver coupled with an FSK
modem chip. Elsema's web page:
http://www.elsema.com/elsema.htm
They are an Australian company but they do export to the USA as well as
other countries. The radio's that I am using operate on 27.145Mhz which is
legal for unliscenced use at up to 1 watt EIRP here in Australia. I have
successfully achieved transmission over close to 2 kilometres(1.25
miles)line of sight, which is about what they claim they are capable of. Ask
if you need more specific help.
Joe Martin
