On the 6.270 board I run an application that is mostly timer interrupt
handlers and motor drivers all written in assembler. I took the assembler
off of the MIT site on Cher and I wrote a small C main program that calls
into the assembler and only returns when it's done. I would imagine the
Handy and Mini boards would be capable of the same method with the
interactive C available for them.
