Here is a summary of what we did at yesterday's Graduate Student
Organization meeting.  Our next meeting will be in 2 weeks (exact
day/time to be announced).

Summary
=======

1. Committee Reviews

   We reviewed the purpose of each committee (descriptions sent out
   earlier--available upon request).  Committees will begin meeting
   between now and our next general meeting to write up what their goals
   are and to begin their work.  Each will report on their progress at
   general meetings, but may also send/request information via the
   general mailing list.

   Below, we list each committee.  Following the names are the number
   of "confirmed" members, then the number of potential members from
   which we are still waiting for confirmation:

     Funding (3/1)
     Healthcare (4)
     Liaison (2)
     Social (2/2)
     Steering (4)

   There is also one person who has volunteered to improve our "housing"
   information.

2. Committee Reports

   The 3 committees that continue from last year gave brief reports.


   Social Committee
   ================

   Jen Wenner <wenner@bu.edu> and Sarah Lyons <slyons@bu.edu> reported
   that we will be able to have movie nights.  At these, movies will be
   shown on campus, free to grad students.  They are still deciding
   on a day/time and frequency; and thus, will give us more information
   about those and the movie night location in the future.

   They also plan to start looking into "brown bag" talks for the semester.
   It is likely that one talk will involve inviting a representative from
   the Chickering (student) insurance company.

   One meeting participant suggested the possibility of putting out a
   "topic of discussion" for a brown bag talk and then having each
   department prepare something to say about the topic.

   Other participants said that Pub Nights could be improved by
   having: more tables set aside, more signs around where the grads
   are sitting, and some people with name tags willing to go around and
   greet people.  Also, that perhaps some simple activities could be
   set up to help "break the ice."

   Liaison Committee
   =================

   Cassandra Celatka <celatka@chem.bu.edu> reported that Andrea White
   (our contact in GRS, who works under Assoc. Dean Whitaker) had not
   yet replied on what is happening with:

   - Our acquisition of a lounge for grad students.

   - Changes in library privileges, which we hope will give all grads the
     same (better) borrowing privileges as TFs.

   After being asked by a meeting participant about our rapport with
   the administration, Cassandra said she felt that while Andrea was
   originally very enthusiastic about doing stuff with the GSO, she has
   backed off some.  The Liaison Committee also feels that sometimes
   the administration has taken our ideas and tried to make them their
   own.

   Healthcare Committee
   ====================

   Rob Pitts <rip@cs.bu.edu> reported that he has written up some
   "guidelines" for summarizing healthcare plans.  These are based
   on what he's learned from writing up plans and are meant to keep
   plan summaries consistent and complete should new members of the
   committee write up plans.

   A definite goal is to get a good writeup of the Chickering plan
   (especially so that new students who don't have documentation on
   the BU plan can compare it to others we have summarized).

   A meeting attendee suggested having information about plans more
   accessible to students before they come here (by finding more ways
   to publicize our Healthcare Pages, etc.)

3. NAGPS Conference

   We discussed whether we will participate in the National Conference
   of the National Assoc. of Graduate-Professional Students (NAGPS) to
   be held in the Boston area (Boston/Braintree), Nov. 18-22.

   Gary Garber <ggarber@buphy.bu.edu>, who attended the NAGPS Northeast
   Regional Conference back in March 1998, stated that he felt that the
   most useful parts of the conference were pamphlets/info and networking
   with reps from other grad groups during conference meals.  He felt that
   the workshops (at least at the Northeast conference) were less useful.

   Normally, registration for the conference is $250/person.  Since
   this is not feasible for us, we have a couple other options:

   - Send reps at a day rate (approx. $50/day, but possibly lower if
     the NAGPS decides on a way to exclude meals).

   - Send volunteers.  Those that help run parts of the conference will
     be allowed to attend certain functions (usually on the same day
     they volunteer).

   Gary proposed that we try to ask GRS for some money to attend the
   conference.  We can also get more information about what types of
   volunteer work can be done.

   The consensus was that we should send some reps to the conference
   and that a good approach may be to send people from committees that
   would benefit from gathering information by networking with other
   grad orgs, e.g., Steering ("How are other groups run?"), Funding
   ("What is the funding situation at other schools?"), Healthcare
   ("How have grad orgs made strides in student healthcare?").

4. Registering the GSO/Becoming Official

   Rob Pitts <rip@cs.bu.edu> reported on what he learned from a meeting
   with a representative from the Student Activities Office (SAO) about
   what groups must do for official recognition at BU.

   Besides having at least 5 members, we'd need:

   - a constitution
   - a president and treasurer
   - an advisor

   in order to register.  The deadline for registering this semester
   was Wed, Sept 23.  Nonetheless, IF we do choose to register, it
   could be done in the spring (Feb) or next fall.

   Rob received materials that detail the requirements and benefits
   of being registered.  Below are listed some (not a complete list)
   of the advantages and disadvantages of registering:

   Advantages
   ----------

   - More visibility: registered groups can be part of some BU
     publications, calendars, event lists, possibly linked to via
     an SAO website, voice mail.

   - Tax-exempt status for purchases.

   - Use of university facilities (which we've used already to some
     degree).

   Disadvantages
   -------------

   - Cannot advertise (in any way) an event until it has been approved
     by the SAO.

   - Must notify the SAO before allowing a non-BU person to attend
     functions.

   - Lots of procedures/paperwork for spending money.

   ------

   We'll turn the documents that detail registering a group (and rules
   for registered groups) over to the Steering Committee.  They can study
   it in detail and give a more complete report on the pros/cons at some
   later date.  For now, we'll leave the issue of registering up in the air.
