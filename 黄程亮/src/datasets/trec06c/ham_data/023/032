Hi All,

I have been fighting a problem off and on for about a month now.  In IC 3.2
I can get pcode to load via the Settings menu item.  I power cycle the
board and the IC message and heartbeat comes up on the HB.  When I go to
load my libs file I get board synchronization errors.  Below is a capture
of one of my IC sessions.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks
Mike
