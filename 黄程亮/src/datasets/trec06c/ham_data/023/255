Russ,

From your email address I assume your are looking for parts in the UK. 

SRAM - I don't have a Farnell catalog around but almost any 32Kx8 SRAM should work. RS part number: 311-007 Toshiba TC55257DPI, 265-465 NEC uPD43256.

68HC11 - The 68HC11A1FN is a surface mount PLCC package. It will fit in the 52 pin socket.

You should also be able to get these parts from Maplin.
