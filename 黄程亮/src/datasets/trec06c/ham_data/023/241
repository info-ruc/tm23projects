the "correct" way is to measure their resistance with an ohmmeter.  if
it's less than 5 ohms, it might be a problem.

the "other" way is to just plug them in and turn on the motor
outputs.  as long as you use full power (not any of the
software-reduced power modes), the chips have thermal protection
against overloading.

if the motor chips get so hot they'll burn you, that is bad.  if the
HB immediately resets and beeps when you try to turn on the motor,
that is also bad.
