BS (shahian),

I have written a Machine code programming system, that I use for the 
Handyboards, in the microprocessor classes I lecture at this 
university.

The Machine code programming system is similar to the Motorolla 
Buffalo Operating system for the EV and EV-U boards.

You can obtain a copy at:

http://132.234.46.5/programs/

The documentation is also at that site.

I do not have a miniboard, so I do not know if it will run on it.  
But it probably would.
