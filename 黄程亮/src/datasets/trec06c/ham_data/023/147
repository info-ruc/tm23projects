Subject: multitasking using start_process();
Content-Type: text/plain

I've read through the maunual for the Handy Board, and I am aware that 
the handy board has multitasking capabilities.  The manual says that the 
function:  start_process(...) is the function to use to have the handy 
board multitask.  WHERE is this function?  It isn't in any of the 
libraries that come with IC 2.85, this manual was for this version.  Can 
anyone email me the code?  To substitute I've been using an infinite 
loop such as:
while (1)
{
...
}

This works, but the start_process fucntion is A LOT more intuitive.  Can 
anyone help? 

thanks!
