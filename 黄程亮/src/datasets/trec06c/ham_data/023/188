After not having used the handyboard for half a year I'm trying to get
it going again.
The problem is: when connected to the battery (but turned off and all
sensors and motors are unplugged), it draws about 0.15 amps
After about a minute or two, it's even 0.6 amps, and the voltage
regulator on board gets really hot.

The board doesn't seem very dusty or dirty, and half a year ago it was
working well.

Does anybody have an idea how to fix it?

Thanks in advance

Chris
