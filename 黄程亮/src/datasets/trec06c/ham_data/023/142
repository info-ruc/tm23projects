Notes from the Meeting at RAL on the 25/9/98 concerning IDET services.

Present: A.Nicholls RAL, M.Hatch CERN

1) ITC scintillator brackets
MH handed over details of the latest requirements for the arrangement of
fibres from the ITC scintillator. These fibres connect into the 80mm
deep tile plug via 7mm thick brackets at nominal 290mm centres in R-PHI.
These brackets attach to the underside of the 80mm tile plug, are 70mm
high and protrude 75mm from the end-cap tile end plate - 20mm inboard
from the face of the 80mm tile plug. There is a 45 degree chamfer on
these brackets to limit the effect on IDET services.
Although these brackets are in close proximity to the IDET services the
above arrangements are considered reasonable and are agreed.

2) Arrangement of IDET patch panels in the gap and full scale modelling.
MH handed over drawings showing possible locations and dimensions of
IDET patch panels in the gap region. The time is considered right for a
full scale model to be started. The dimensions of this model were
discussed. It was agreed that the model should include a region that
covers:
- 3 LAr front-end crates
- 2 adjacent IDET patch panel regions
- The tile cal fingers outboard of these crates
- 2 BIS and one BIL muon chambers.
The wooden model will be built at CERN. The IDET collaboration will
install their patch panels and services in the space available between
the above items. MH will produce a document describing the proposals for
this model.
This model is in addition and complementary to the model proposed by the
IDET collaboration.

3) IDET Fibres
MH handed over a drawing from R.Mclaren, CERN, showing proposals for
fibre types, connectors and lengths from the IDET to the USA15. Comments
invited.

4) TRT read out
A.Nicholls to advise MH the cross-sectional area requirements of the TRT
read out. Currently twisted pairs for cost reasons. Potential for space
saving if optical fibre ?

5) IDET Power supplies
AN to advise MH the contact persons for IDET power supplies.

6) SCT Power cables
AN handed over specification of flat power cables. MH to pass on to
K-H.Steinberg, CERN, to investigate possible alternatives.
