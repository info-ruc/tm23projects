I don't know how big the IC stack is, but I suspect you are overflowing it
because you're allocating the array on the stack.  If it's an array of
floating point the 10x10 array will be at least 400 bytes, and most likely
larger.

Try allocating the array as a static.  That is, declare it outside of the
function.

Later,
