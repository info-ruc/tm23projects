Dear all,

I just obtained a HB and I would like it to control my robot.

This is the situation:
The robot is currently functioning ok and it is controlled by a 16-bit
microcontroller, all the motions can be controlled simply by giving it a
command which looks like "GS"(Get sensor), "FD110"(Forward with speed 1 and
distance 10 inches).

However, it has to be connected to the PC all the time and I would like to have
it function independently when no commands are given in a period of time.

As I know, a program can be downloaded to the HB and it can then run without
any PC connection.

Can anybody give me some insights on how this can be done?


Thanks!


Keith
