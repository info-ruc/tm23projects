The problem is that I am already using the console port to communicate to
a pc.  What I would like is to have one or more devices communicate back
to the handyboard then the handyboard communicate to the pc.

On the home page there is link to "9600 baud serial output driver" what I
am looking for is a "9600 baud serial input driver"

Thanks,
Joe Hoffmann
