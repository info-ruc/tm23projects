Hi Everybody,

Sorry for bugging you all, but I'm desperate for some help...

My graphics Display preferences got messed up, and reinstalling the graphics 
card driver is not fixing it...

Last night I downloaded and unzipped http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Proj
ects/hb/software/ic2853r2.zip , but while I was reading the Readme.ic file, I 
saw the mention to the *.pif files, which prompt me to investigate the 
contents of one of those *.pif files...

So, I selected c:\ic\ic.pif, "right button clicked" it, selected "Open 
with...", selected "Notepad", and this is what happened next...

After selecting "Notepad" (for opening the file), and hitting enter, I got a 
black screen with something like a square white box (almost like a cursor, bit 
bigger, and "not blinking") on the top left corner of my screen... After that 
I tried "exit", but nothing happend (same black screen)... Did it again, and 
nothing... Hit "Esc, and nothing... Pressed "Ctrl+Alt+Del", and nothing too... 
Did it a few more times and still nothing... So I had to reset the machine...

After it came up, the standard windows graphics driver was installed... I 
tried to reconfigure, then reinstalling (from disk, and later dowloading a new 
driver from Number 9's web site) the correct driver for my graphics card, but 
somehow, windows keep using it's standard driver, and it's 640x480 
resolution...

The mentioned machine is a dual processor motherboard running one Pentium Pro 
200, with 128 Mb RAM, and an "Imagine 128 Series 2" graphics card from 
"Numbber 9". The OS is NT Server 4.0 with service pack 3. Please let me know 
if you need any extra system info...

Does anyone have any clue on what happened ? Does anybody know how to fix the 
problem ?

Any help will be greatly appreciatted...

Thank you in advance,

Andre Philippi.
