Subject: Serial I/O again
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII



Greetings!

I need a "good" sample of how to do serial i/o between the Handy Board
and a host computer. The host computer I am intereested in is running
MACOS (8.X).

Here is the scenario:

- The HB has an IC program downloaded on it.
- The program runs on it for a while, collecting some data (in any array)
- From time to time, I would like to enter a mode in the program where
  - I reconnect the HB to the computer (via serial interface)
  - The program transmits the array on to the computer.

In my mind, I need two things:

- A program on the host that talks to the serial port and "and listens"
  for the data. When the data arrives, it captures it into its own internal
  data structure (on the host).
- A set of routines on the HB that transmit the data.

I have seen various ways of doing this on the HB (i..e transmit). However,
at the moment, I am clueless about what I need to do on the host computer's
program to access the serial port. Ideally, I would like to run a program
different from IC to do this (unless there is a built-in feature in IC that
enables this).

Thanks,

Deepak.
