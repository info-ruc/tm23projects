Hello all,

    i'm developing my MicroMouse robot with the HandyBoard and i was
thinking about having 12 IR analog sensors (from Quality Technologies -
QRD 1114). However, the HB suports only 7 analog input sensors. So, is
there any way that i can use the digital inputs of the HB to read my
analog sensors? In case i need to use an A/D circuit, does anybody have
any idea of  where i could buy it ?

Thank you very much.

Marcelo Manjon
