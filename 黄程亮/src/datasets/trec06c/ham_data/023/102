Hi all,

 I've started playing with the Handy Board last week and needed more 
digital outputs then provided. After a quick look at the schematics, 
FAQ's and the manual, I decided to disable the motor circuitry and 
use the latch mapped to address 0x0e to get 8-bit digital out. This 
worked for me. However, I need 16 more digital outputs so right now
I'm tending towards using an MC6821 as a"bus expander". I have never
worked with the 6821 before so any comments on that would be welcome.

Ozan
