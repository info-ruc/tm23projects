Subject: help on a ADC 
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Thu, 08 Oct 1998 10:44:55 PDT

greetings everyone.

im building a digital oscilloscope (to use on a PC) for a project in 
school
but im running into trouble with the ADC im using because it says to use 
separate grounds and VCC for the digital and analogue parts, but 
browsing around i4ve seen designs that have a COMMON VCC and grounds, 
with some capacitors (for filtering noise i imagine)
if anyone who has worked with ADC4s (or digital oscilloscopes for that 
matter!) at high freqs (5-20 MHz) has any ideas or experiences that can 
help me please repply.
thanks
