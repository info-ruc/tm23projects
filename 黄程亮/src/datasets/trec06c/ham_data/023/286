Subject: Mindstorms

Hi Fred.  I enjoy the listserv, though I am a real novice and don't always
understand what is going on.  But, I am reading and learning.  I just found
out that you helped with the creation of the Legos Mindstorm robots, which
I have purchased two for my science classes.  Unfornuately, they only run
on Windows 95 and we are a MAC (God help us) school.  But, I am building a
couple of computers to run the Mindstorms, so in time, we should be up and
running.  I was wondering, how similar/dissimilar are the Mindstorms from
the handyboard?  Also, how is the new addition board coming along?
thanking you in advance
James Jones
