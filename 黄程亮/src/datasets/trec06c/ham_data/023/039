I'm doing a project for school.  I'm buiding a fire fighting robot and I =
need to do research on what other people have done in the past with fire =
fighting robots.  For example the Trinity College contest, if there's a =
URL please E-Mail it to the list.  Or you can just E-Mail info about =
your robot to the mailing list.  If there is anyone who doesn't want me =
to use his/her name in my report please indicate that in your response.

Thanks in advance
