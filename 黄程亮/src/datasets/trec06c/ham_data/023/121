I had the same trouble with the reset thing.  In the manual it states 
that resetting the board is simply turning the board on and off, this 
should work.  I've had the same trouble you've had.  The thing that was 
impeding me was the fact that I was using the WINDOWS based downloader 
(to download the initial file called something like:  pc_hbr122.s19).  I 
then used the DOS based downloader (DL.exe) and downloaded it with no 
trouble and then used IC.exe, this works flawlessly.  You should be 
using the DOs based DLer.
