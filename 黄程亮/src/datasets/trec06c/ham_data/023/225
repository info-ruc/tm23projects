Hi all,

 I need to connect a 4x40 LCD to the Handy Board. The "daughter 
board"(*) seems to contain the HD44780 controller and a 2x16 LCD. 
Ideally, we'd like to remove only the 2x16 LCD and replace it with a 
4x40 LCD that supports the HD44780. Any suggestions on how to make
this change transparent to the system?

Ozan

terminology.
