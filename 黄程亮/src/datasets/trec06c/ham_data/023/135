Hi All,
I am trying to write a code for fuzzy logic and using Matrix havig a size
of 10X10, but it gives an error (stack overflow). When i reduce the size
of matrix to 6X6 it works perfectly.I am using IC 3.0.
Can I  use a matrix having a size greator than 6x6, if there is a way, can
anybody help me out.
Thanks in advance.




Kind Regards

Sincerely,
Javaid Iqbal
