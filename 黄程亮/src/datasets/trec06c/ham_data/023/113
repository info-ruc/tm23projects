I have been attempting to run a circuit of my own design which requires both
a 9.5-14v DC supply and a 5v DC supply from a 9.6v NiCad. I run the 9.6v
straight to the part of the circuit which requires that voltage and that
works fine. I then take the 9.6v to an LM350 regulator adjusted to 5v DC
which is supposed to be capable of delivering 3A. The regulator seems to be
working fine when it is checked with a multimeter but when I attempt to
operate the circuit which should and seems to only want to draw about 400mA
it fails to work.
  The same circuit works reliably when connected in the manner illustrated
below to both the 9.6v battery and a regulated 5v DC(on the HB) supply which
is in turn
connected through a 12v 1A DC supply connected to the 240v mains.

The negative terminals of both supplies are not in any way connected within
the circuit but the connection between the positive terminals seems to be
essential. I have discovered this method of powering my project quite by
accident and am interested in any methods for obtaining both the 5v supply
and the 6.5-14v supply from a battery as that is what will be required.
Thank You
