Ok, after reading it for the nth time, I think I understand this statement
now:

<<The normally open case means that the sensor line is pulled high by the 47K
resistor on the Handy Board. The standard software for reading the state of a
switch interprets this logic high value as ``not pressed'' or false. When the
switch is closed, the sensor line is connected to ground, and the software
reads a logic low value, which is interpreted as ``pressed'' or true. >>

I've heard the term Pull-up resistor before and didn't understand it.  I've
only had 1 electronics course (yrs ago) and am just a little confused as to
which direction current is pulled, or how you pull current.  (+ to -?)

I'll stop talking now...and hit the books some more.  Sorry for the wasted
bandwidth!

Gerald.
