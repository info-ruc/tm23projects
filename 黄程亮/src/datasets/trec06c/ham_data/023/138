Hello,

You have to download the IC in download-mode again. All memory (32K volatile
SRAM) will be lost after you disconnect all the power from the board.

However, if you just turn-off the power (without removing power adapter or
batteries) of the board , all memory content will be fine. Interactive-C
will boot again once you turn-on the power switch.


Thanks and Best Regards,

Patrick
