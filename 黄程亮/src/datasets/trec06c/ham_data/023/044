Hi Kyle,

You quoted:
>The speed of the Bussard jet soon reaches an upper
>limit--about 10 percent of light speed--where thrust is equal to wind
>resistance and the ship can accelerate no further."

This thus means that the exhaust velocity of a Bussard drive is also about
0.1c (assuming minimal energy losses). If somehow the exhaust velocity
could be increased, then so would the maximum velocity.

Kyle, does the text from which you quoted also say something about maximum
exhaust velocity? Ie. Why can't the Bussard design be upgraded to say
exhaust velocities of 0.5c?

Timothy et. al.,

There seems to be two separate issues here, one of which may be valid and
one is not.

First, Kyle is correct that when drag equals thrust, acceleration will stop.
Note that I said acceleration, you will still have to maintain thrust in
order to maintain velocity or drag will slow you down. Of, course this
actually applies to the scoop area and assumes that scoop area is a
constant, so I suppose you could "fold" the scoop and reduce drag. For that
matter, you could reduce the scoop area constantly to maintain a constant
acceleration irregardless of drag...remember, drag is a function of area and
so is scoop efficiency. If the scoop area decreases for a given amount of
power, then its efficiency will increase as a function of field density
while drag is decreasing at a proportional rate. The trick is to balance
scoop area against the interstellar hydrogen density to maintain a more or
less constant thrust. If engine ISP is also increased then the area of the
scoop can be increased accordingly. There will always be some "magic point"
where scoop area, hydrogen density, and engine ISP will maximize thrust
WITHOUT an upper limit on velocity.

Second, the upper limit on velocity IS NOT the exhaust velocity of the
engine, go back to your freshman physics book if you don't believe me, and I
don't care who you've been reading. With enough reaction mass, you can get
to light speed by THROWING tennis balls off the back of the Santa Maria!

The only real problems (if one forgets the low local density) here are scoop
design and efficiency, engine efficiency (ISP) and design lifetime. An
antimatter drive fed by onboard hydrogen initially and later by interstellar
hydrogen could approach ANY fraction of the speed of light and do it fairly
quickly. By sacrificing a bit of thrust, it can even replenish its onboard
fuel enroute for the deceleration run.

Since we have several new subscribers, and many new subscribers
immediately start wondering why our design project excludes FTL,
let me just make a few introductory remarks:

We exclude FTL drives from consideration (for now) for the same
reason we exclude a lot of other things like "vacuum energy" --
they're simply too speculative.  The main point of this list is
to consider interstellar travel as an engineering problem, and to
think about sound engineering designs.  That means that we limit
ourselves to things that are less speculative and known to be
physically possible.  Relativity, hydrogen fusion and antimatter,
as examples, are observable and experimentally verifiable.  Until
someone demonstrates FTL travel _of a massive particle_ or
successfully extracts "vacuum energy" in experimentally
verifiable ways, these things won't be considered because it's
impossible to make an engineering design without a real
understanding of such effects.

In general relativistic terms, superluminal expansion of
spacetime isn't at all the same as FTL travel of mass.  Even
during that inflationary phase there was no mass traveling faster 
than light through spacetime.

And just what other FTL processes do you think exist?  Theorists
have yet to come up with anything tenable for allowing mass to
travel FTL.  Things like quantum connectedness don't allow
transfer of mass or even information.  Attempts to theoretically
describe FTL effects using general relativity have so far always
run into physical impossibilities like negative energy densities.

Actually, it's not a problem with distant observers; if you can
go FTL you can trivially travel into your own past.  Just do an
FTL jump, accelerate sufficiently, and then do another FTL jump
back to the location you started from.  The amount of
acceleration needed to do this depends on how much faster than
light you went, how far your jump was, and how far back you want
to travel into your own past.

Unfortunately it's difficult to include a spacetime diagram of
this effect here.

However, as Steve points out, this list is not a place for discussing

Yes, you can get there with a reactionless drive..but to do so
efficiently and quickly, FTL is quite attractive.

I'm not sure I would put it in quite those terms.  If someone
comes up with solid, verified results of something like FTL
propulsion of mass I'm sure we'd be the first to welcome the
information.

Some discussion of speculative topics here is unavoidable; as has
been pointed out before, even the sorts of things we're more
inclined to consider still involve a fair amount of speculation
(i.e. antimatter exists, but how would we make enough to fuel a
starship?).

I simply want to emphasize, for those people new to the list,
that this list is intended for the discussion of practical,
achievable methods for interstellar travel, and therefore is more 
limited in speculation than other forums might be.

A theory cannot tell you if something is or is not possible. Many of the
scientists who hold power today fail to recongnize this. Experiments can
give you proof, but not theory. I am not saying theory is bad, however.
It is necessary to logically organize experimental results and make
predictions.

No one can say. It may happen tomorrow, or it may take hundreds of
years.

According to special relativity, when an object travels FTL, it can
create what is known as a causality violation. What this is is when some
observer disagrees as to whether the FTL object left point A and went to
point B, or went from point B to point A. In other words, to this
observer, the ship's arrival at its destination occurred before it left
its origin. You can set up a situation with round trip FTL travel that
can allow a ship to return to its origin before it leaves (time travel).
(If you want to learn more about special relativity, read "Spacetime
Physics" by Taylor and Wheeler.)

What really happens? No one knows. If FTL is possible, then it certainly
will not involve time travel...there are many strong arguments against
time travel. But it is wrong, and quite arrogant for some scientists to
preclude FTL because time travel is impossible. Notice, I am not saying
time travel is impossible. It may or may not be. The same with FTL. FTL
and time dilation: First, calculate gamma. Gamma is equal to
1/((1-v^2)^.5) so gamma for an object travelling .6c relative to another
observer is 1.25. This means that the moving object's time goes 1.25
times slower than the stationary object. For an object going 3c, try it
on a scientific calculator. gamma=1/((1-3^2)^.5) gamma= approx
(0,-.35355) An imaginary number. This is where things really get
complicated. So, does this mean that FTL is impossible, or that
relativity can't correctly predict what happens for FTL? That is a very
good question, and if you can figure it out, you will likely be in the
textbooks. It is fun to theorize about FTL, but this really isn't the
place.

But even if someone proves FTL motion of mass, it would take awhile to
develop the necessary system. Accelerating matter to FTL might not
directly lead to a 'warp drive'. I think that even if FTL is discovered
tommorow, it will be quite some time before we can seriously start
designing FTL starships. It would be interesting to discuss the results
though, and I'd be interested even if they figured out how to send
information FTL. Applying real FTL to a starship engine might take time
though.

By speculative, I meant things that have not yet been toatlly all out
demonstrated. Antimatter is real (albeit very expensive), but FTL motion
of matter...we haven't done that yet.

Lee,

You may want to reconsider the following:

>don't care who you've been reading. With enough reaction mass, you can get

Unfortunately that reaction mass has to be accelerated by the ship to
transfer  momentum. The trouble is that the reaction mass is already having
a large velocity (0.1c) relative to the ship, because it is scooped. So to
add velocity (accelerate) to the particles, the exhaust velocity has to be
larger than 0.1c.

On the Santa Maria one doesn't scoop particles, but instead the particles
are at assumed to be stored on the ship. This makes it easy to accelerate
them.
So the comparison with the Santa Maria is totally off.

Well, that is VERY much a question of philosophy...

I personnaly think that it is well within the capacity of the human mind
to give proof from theory alone, as long as the base for the theory is
sound and your reasoning is stringent enough such a proof is at LEAST as
real to me as any experimental measurment. 

It all depends on your view of what constitutes the (scientific) thruth!
To you it is limeted to what can be OBSERVED, to me it is limeted to what
can be EXPLAINED and to others it might be a combination of the two!



Sorry for straying so far OT

In the particular instance of ramjets, you are correct that you have to be
able to accelerate the reaction mass to greater than its original velocity
relative to the ship. In addition, you must also do so without slowing the
reaction mass down on its way through, that problem has been realized for
quite some time. But I was speaking of reaction mass propulsion in general.

After looking back at the original statement, I see it was applied during a
conversation about ramjets and was probably meant to apply to them
specifically. But the way it was worded made it appear to apply to reaction
mass thrust in general...a patently false idea.

The ramjet idea does have several difficulties to over come if it is to work
however:

1)	A solid scoop will never work. Even if a thousand or ten thousand meter
scoop could be designed to withstand up to one tenth of a g of acceleration,
as the velocity increased, the mass of the matter impacting it would go up
proportionately. It would soon grow beyond any reasonable engineering.

2) 	If the scoop is immaterial, i.e. a field of some sort, then the same
argument still applies although a little differently. As speed increases,
the field strength must be increased without increasing the field area in
order to prevent more and more of the matter from slipping through before it
can be deflected far enough to bring it to the ship.

3)	As you point out, all of this deflection must be done without generating
so much drag from slowing down the fuel that we can't get enough thrust out
of burning the fuel.

What I would suggest, is that IF we can generate a field sufficiently strong
to catch ionized hydrogen, then we can probably generate one strong enough
to function as a sort of inside out accelerator and simply magnetically (or
whatever) propel the hydrogen backward without even bothering to burn it.
The second possibility is that the field itself may be able to accelerate
the matter as it is deflected inward, before it is burned thereby gaining
additional thrust rather than drag.

You may stop the particles, but you shouldn't loose too much energy in
doing so, because you have to speed up the particles again. This scenario
is usually to difficult to realize, hence it is best to not slow down the
particles.

>After looking back at the original statement, I see it was applied during a

Yes, applied to scooping only.

There is something I didn't think of before: Some of the particles that the
scoop tries to pick up will never reach the intake of the engine, because
the scoop field was just not strong enough (The magnetic scoop field does
not have a sharp edge, hence there will be particles that encounter a weak
field and they will be moved towards the intake, but not quite.). These
particles thus generate drag without contributing as reaction mass or fuel.
The larger the velocity of the ship, the more particles will slip through
the scoopfield and thus the more drag will be created.

So the sharper the edge (the greater the magnetic fieldstrength difference)
the  better the performance of the scoop.

This thus also means that my initial assumption "final velocity equals
exhaust velocity" isn't valid per se, but depends on the efficiency of the
field.

This is what led me to the thought mentioned by me above. (I'm not sure you
[Lee] realized what I wrote above.)

We have to burn it partially, since we need to add kinetic energy. That is
unless we have another source of energy on the ship of course (this source
should not be underestimated!).

Same argument, acceleration in this case means adding energy.

Timothy, Lee, 
	I like the point about the "sharpness" of the field affecting
efficiency.  However, I question the basic premise of a non-burning scoop.
In all of the discussions on the list about propulsion (about 90%, I'd
say) the final question is always the weight/energy ratio of the fuel.  
Even if your reaction mass _is_ gathered, if you carry 5000 times your dry
weight in fuel, you havent really gained much since the acceleration of
the ship is only dependent on how much wattage is put our the back.  
Scooping then simply becomes a way to add extra weight and complexity to
the ship. In order for scooping to be a good idea, the interstellar
hydrogen should be burned enough to at least make up for the added weight
and drag of the scoop, and then some.  How feasible this is
engineering-wise I can't say. 
Best Regards,
Nels Lindberg

Lee, 

You have given me a great idea (experienced list members will be ducking
for cover I assume ;)

let's rethink the idea of "engine", "scoop", and "sail"

scoop is a means of interacting with the interstellar medium.

engine is a means of accelerating the medium thereby moving us.

sail in this sense is a means of gathering energy.  a _trailing_ mesh of
some bits of silicon to turn UV radiation into electrical energy.

Please note, this is a very rough draft, there may be things I have not
thought out, I am thinking on the fly here.

What if a beaming system from earth simply created a "charge tunnel" in
the interstellar Hydrogen?  Then a ship could gather electrical energy
from a trailing sail, and use this energy to push against the charged
Hydrogen. perhaps using an oscilating electrical field.  The individual
hydrogen atoms, would not need to be drawn toward the ship, fused, and
expelled, but could be used in situ.  As the ship passed, each atom
would gain a small accel towards earth,  I think this would totally
eliminate the need for focusing the beam, earth would "paint" space a
fraction on an arc degree (limited by the wavelength of radiation
(ultraviolet would work best here)) around the target star, and the ship
could maneuver within that volume.  The entire engine would be outside
the ship!  the ship could be any size, but saucer shaped (to maximize
cross sectional area might be good) or cylindrical (to maximize
protection from speed induced radiation)

One main advantage is that you could establish this "charge tunnel" well
ahead of actual launch.

On the way back, you could wait to see the beam from earth before
heading back, and the hydrogen atoms that were accelerated towards earth
on the outbound trip would be accelerated towards Tau Ceti on the in
bound trip.

We have often wished for something to push against.

anyone care to shoot some holes in this?

Lee, 

I think this would be a suitable sentence in hell, you must spend
eternity throwing tennis balls out the back of a full-sized replica of
the santa maria, until you reach .9999 C. Sort of like Sisyphus.

Kevin,

This is pretty much what Timothy and I were discussing. To clear up a few
points for the rest of the list...

In order for an electromagnetic scoop to work, the particles that it
"scoops" must be charged, or ionized, you cannot scoop a neutral particle.

The most common method proposed for creating charged particles is to beam a
laser "fan" ahead of the ship. The photons impacting the interstellar
hydrogen will create a hydrogen ion with a negative charge which can then be
attracted to a positively charged scoop field.

In this much at least your idea is good. It removes the mass of the lasers
from the ship and you could actually use an uncollimated solar mirror which
is much simpler.

However, the density of the scoop field and the energy required to generate
it are still enormous. On board power generation would probably have to be
several times larger than a small city's supply.


Timothy,

How do you generate a field with a sharp boundary?

Where the dashed line is some sort of combination field conductor, and
energy collector.  I see this ship as a large saucer, with living
quarters toward the middle, and a very thin mesh of wires, and energy
collectors spread out along the periphery.  Rotation would keep the
whole thing stable, and spread out.  the above view would be from the
side.  Think of it as a giant version of starwisp, but instead of
reflecting the energy, the mesh collects the energy, turns it into
electricity, which supports an electric field of several megawatts
potential.  I suppose we'll need two meshes, one for the positive
charge, and one for the negative.  They only need to be separated enough
to prevent bridging.

I imagine the field must be pulsed to get any use out of it, but with a
"Sail" a few hundred kilometers across, we should find enough Hydrogen
to push against.  Not much, granted, but with a big enough field, we
should be able to make the hydrogen ions move fast enough so as to push
us in the the opposite direction.  

I think perhaps this would work better at higher speeds, where the
apparent density will increase.

Umm... Negative?  By stripping away an electron, wouldn't it be
positive?  If I'm wrong, then reverse the charges on the above drawing.

mirror, really?  That would be better, but would it be strong enough at
light years distance?

not if you are swimming in a sea of energy capable of ionizing hydrogen

The problem is how to generate two monopolar fields? If you simply use two
grids, your net thrust will be zero.

I'm not sure, but I think you would end up with both positive and negative
ions in roughly equal amounts.

> not if you are swimming in a sea of energy capable of ionizing hydrogen

Umm. there is not really that much usable energy there for the taking.

I received this letter some time ago, when I was on my holidays.
I have not yet checked the recommended site - maybe it contains 
something interesting..

Travel close to the speed of light as you fly a Star Ship to a distant
planet into orbit around a distant star.
I've written a program to make some calculations. I'm not sure if I'm crazy
or just wrong, but if I'm right, it might be something to think about and
share with the world.

Please check it out at http://www.dundee.net/holmsoft/StarTrip.html

Please let me know what you think about this at holmsoft@dundee.net

If you could share this with some friends, I would really appreciate it.

Accelerating at one Earth gravity, 32.2 feet per second per second.
The Ship will reach 99.9995750753503 percent Light Velocity.
At that velocity, one day on the Ship will equal about 343 Earth days.
The Ship will be traveling about one Earth Light Year per one Ship day.
To reach this velocity will take 11 months 18.13 Ship days or 1 year 6
months 5.41 Earth days.
Accelerated by a Ram Jet Fusion Engine using Interstellar Hydrogen for
fuel. At near light velocity the Engine Scoops will be collecting billions 
of Hydogen protons per second.
I hope a rock doesn't hit the windshield.

This table lists all known stars within a radius of 54 light-years that are
single or part of a wide multiple star system. They have no known
irregularities or variabilities and are between 0.4 and 2.0 times the
luminosity of the sun. Thus, a planet basically identical to Earth could be
orbiting around any one of them. (Data from the Catalog of Nearby Stars,
1969 edition, by Wilhelm Gliese.)

Lee,

>How do you generate a field with a sharp boundary?

Essentially you don't want a field where it can't contribute. Magnetic
shielding (with say iron) would be one solution. Another probably more
efficient solution would be to design coils in such a way that the
strongest parts of the magnetic field are contained in the volume where one
would like them most.

I've added a GIF to visualize what I mean with designing/shaping a coil.

(WARNING: a little understanding about magnetic fields is necessary)
(Red=tube around which electric wire is wound to make an electromagnet)
(Blue=part of the magnetic magnetic field outside the coil)

In the images, the charged particles are assumed to arrive from the right
side.

Let's start with image C, a charged particle will spiral towards the mouth
of the engine. The stronger the magnetic field, the smaller the "circle" of
its path. The magnetic field should be perpendicular on the direction of
motion, to accomplish this. (Perpendicular on the direction of motion in
these drawings is up/down and inside/outside the paper.)

The particles will come from the right, thus we would want want the
strongest perpendicular field at the right side. As I hope you can imagine,
design B will accomplish this better than design A.

Essentially the shape of the edges(openings) of the coil and their
direction will shape the field. One can for example also flatten the edges
(ie. make them ellipsoidal rather than circular). Also combinations of
coils may shape the field more and more as preferred.

BTW. You might be able to scoop a neutral particle, since neutral particles
can have magnetic spin. I guess though that the magnetic-magnetic
interaction between the spin and the scoop field is much less than the
electric-magnetic interaction of an ionized atom and the magnetic scoop field.


Nels,

As far as I know we always meant to use the scooped hydrogen as fuel and
propellant, not for propellant alone. We might carry a bit of anti-matter
to ignite fusion reactions, but that's about it.

Timothy

Hi Group,
Let's see if I can say something sensible.

We all know that a hydro-fusion ramjet just ain't gonna get to 0.9 c let alone .999etc.
Also I don't know how Larry calculated his figures but they're way off. To reach a gamma
of 343 it'd take 332.5 years real time, and 12.66 years tau. He got the rock against the
windshield right though.

I'm a bit suspicious. Sounds too eager to have people visit his site and download. Does
he have a virus he wants to share?
