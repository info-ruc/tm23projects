Subject: PicoJava article
Message-ID: <CMM.0.91.0.907780329.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

During last night's Java-SIG meeting in EMCB, the subject of PicoJava
came up briefly.

Coincidentally, in yesterday's mail, I received a new journal issue
that has an extensive article on the design of the PicoJava chip:

@String{j-COMPUTER              = "Computer"}

@Article{McGhan:1998:CPP,
  author =       "Harlan McGhan and Mike O'Connor",
  title =        "Computing Practices: {PicoJava}: {A} Direct Execution
                 Engine For {Java} Bytecode",
  journal =      j-COMPUTER,
  volume =       "31",
  number =       "10",
  pages =        "22--30",
  month =        oct,
  year =         "1998",
  CODEN =        "CPTRB4",
  ISSN =         "0018-9162",
  bibdate =      "Tue Oct 6 18:50:08 MDT 1998",
  URL =          "http://www.computer.org/computer/co1998/rx022abs.htm;
                 http://dlib.computer.org/co/books/co1998/pdf/rx022.pdf",
  acknowledgement = ack-nhfb,
}

According to the article, chips are expected to be in production by
the end of 1998 at multiple fabs.

P.S. This journal is received by most IEEE members, so you may be able 
     to find a colleague who has it if you don't already; otherwise,
     copies should be available in major libraries, such as the
     UofUtah Marriott Library.  The article text is available online,
     at the second URL above, provided you have paid for an electronic
     subscription to the journal.
