Converting between types is called casting, and it goes like this:

    float f = 4.6;
    int i = (int) f;     /* should assign 4 to i, I think */
    f = (float) i;       /* ought to assign 4.0 to f */

I'm not certain, but usually casting a float to an integer truncates
(rounds down).  A simple experiment would determine whether I'm
remembering this correctly.  Good luck!
