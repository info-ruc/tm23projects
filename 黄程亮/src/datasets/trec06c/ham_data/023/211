Fred,

Thanks the Polaroid sensors work great.  But I'm having trouble getting =
the two Handy Boards to commicate using Randy's routiine for the 6.270 =
board.   I have one board print everything that it gets from the serial =
port.  And I have another transmitting. The only thing that happens is =
if I turn the transmitting one on while it is connected to the recieving =
one then it displays a number.  But it doesn't display the number that I =
told it to send.  Any info would be helpful.

Thanks, Peter
