Hi,=20

Is it possible for 2 HBs to communicate via the serial port using Randy =
Sargent's serial code?
(http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html)
I'm not too smart in electronics so I plugged a standard telephone cable =
between two HBs and one of them turned off and smoke came from around =
the SPI.  I don't need to send strings just simple characters.  Any help =
would be appreciated.=20

Also does anyone have the ISBN for "Mobile Robots Inspiration to =
Implementation" ?

Thank You
Peter Eacmen
