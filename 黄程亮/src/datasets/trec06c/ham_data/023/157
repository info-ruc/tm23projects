Patrick,

Plugged the board into COM1 and all ok - strange as I use a modem in COM2
and this runs OK.

Thanks for the advice

Andy Burton

<Have you tried to download the IC in COM1?

<Download mode is the same as bootstrap mode where both LEDs (Red and Green)
i<n Handyboard board main board will turn off.

<Please let me know if it still doesn't work.


<Thanks and Best Regards,

<Patrick

><Hello,

><You have to download the IC in download-mode again. All memory (32K

><However, if you just turn-off the power (without removing power adapter or
