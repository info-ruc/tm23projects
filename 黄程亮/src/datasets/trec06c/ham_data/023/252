Hi all,

I have just got a set of blank P.C.B's from Douglas electronics and now
trying to get all the parts togrther
to build the Handy Board. I have managed to find all the parts from R.S.
components and Farnell Electronics
except for the 32Kbit SRAM and the MC68HC11A1FN. Does anybody know of any
equivelent part numbers
for the SRAM. Also i have found the 68HC11 chip from both above suppliers
but they are both marked 'SMT'
which i presume means surface mount. I know this may sound stupid but do the
SMT versions have the legs curled
under the chip body allowing them to fit into a 52 pin PLCC socket.

Please can anyone help!!


cheers Russ.....
