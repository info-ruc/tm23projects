 hi all
        does anyone know if there is a way where we can increase the 
        output frequency of the motor PWM output?

        i did a test by typing " motor(0,50) " and connecting a probe to 
        Motor 0 +ve and to the L293D gnd pin respectively. the reading
        on the oscilloscope showed that the frequency was 500Hz. i tested
        various variations (from motor(0,0) to motor(0,100)) and found 
        out that the output freq. range was from around 250-500Hz. i 
        require around 1000Hz for my project.

        a quick look at the lib_ic, lib_r22 and lib_hb files didn't help
        as i'm still a beginner at C-programming. Fred, i believe you wrote
        the routines in those files, could you tell me what 0x0e is? is
        it the address of a register/port? and can we change the speed/
        frequency of the PWM by modifying the routines?
