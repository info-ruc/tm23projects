Michael,
           I have tried to use the Elsema radios without the modem chips but
because 27Mhz is such a noisy frequency (at least here in Australia) I found
that I got way to much interference when interfacing directly to TTL. The
modem chips are really just tone encoder/decoder pairs and I still get some
interference when using them which must mean that the tones on which they
operate must occasionally be being received by the radios. As a result I
have had to slow my data rates down because I am using them in an
application where timing is critical, my app is nothing like RS-232. It may
be feasible to use them this way in other applications.

    Joe,

    I looked up both the ELSEMA radio link and the modem chips, and it looks
as though a wireless data link could be set up without a modem chip.  It
seems both the FMT2705 and R2705 can handle TTL level logic input and output
respectively.  Does this sound possible to you? Did you actually have to use
a modem chip for the receiver end at the handyboard?
    Thanks for the tips in the last mail, they were much appreciated

    Cheers.
