I am working on a project that requires serial output devices, I would
like to connect these to the digital inputs.  Is there anyone that has
some routines (preferably ic funtions) that I could have that do this.

Is there a way to use the SPI port to do this easily.
Take it easy I'm a beginner.

Thanks in advance,
