This paper proposes a routing algorithm called Associativity-Based Routing (ABR).

In ABR, routes are established on-demand and only the actually desire routes are
maintained. ABR selects a route based on nodes having high associativity states
that imply high stability.

1. Associativity:
A Mobile Host (MH) periodically transmits beacons and updates associativity ticks.
If a MH has low associativity ticks, it is supposed to be in a high state of mobility.
Otherwise, it is supposed to be in a stable state, which is ideal point to perform
routing.

2. Route Selection:
A destination node selects a route based on the associativity ticks and hop distance.
First, a route with the highest associativity ticks will be selected. If there are
multiple routes with the same associativity ticks, the shortest route will be selected.
Further, if even distances are the same, then one of the routes will be arbitrarily
selected.

ABR consists of two phases - Route Discovery Phase and Route Reconstruction Phase.

1. Route Discovery Phase: Initial phase where a route is established.

2. Route Reconstruction Phase: Maintenance phase where topological changes of the
                               network are dealt with.


In my opinion, this paper has the following strength and weakness.

Strength.

1. Associativity.
This paper characterizes the behavior of MHs, defines a new concept 'Associativity'
and proposes a new routing algorithm based on that, which gives originality to this
paper.

2. Adaptiveness and Scalability.
ABR is on-demand and maintains only the information for the desire routes. And route
maintenance algorithm allows locally reconstructing sub set of the route, instead of
the entire route. So, I think, ABR is adaptive and scalable.

Weakness.

1. Associativity ticks.
ABR selects the route which has the highest associativity ticks. But, in my opinion,
stability may not increase for ever as the associativity ticks increase. If the
associativity ticks are too big, it means that a MH stayed at a location for a long
time, so it is likely to move soon. I think, more study on the behavior of MHs can leads
to a mapping from the associativity ticks to stability.
