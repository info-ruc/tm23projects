A Sip of Wine, a Rustic View, and Hog Waste

      A Sip of Wine, a Rustic View, and Hog Waste
      By DAVID W. CHEN
      ENN YAN, N.Y. =97 David DeMarco, the owner of Seneca Shore Wine =
Cellars here, knows that most visitors to the Finger Lakes expect to =
indulge their senses. They want to taste award-winning wines. They want =
to see rustic farmhouses and Mennonite buggies. They want to smell a =
bouquet of lake breezes and fresh-cut hay.

      But these days, people sometimes have little choice but to inhale =
another potent local product: pig manure.

      "The only thing I can vaguely compare it to," said Mr. DeMarco, =
who quit his job as a software engineer in Manhattan to move here in =
1993, "is on the worst day of summer =97 hot and humid =97 and the worst =
subway in =97 pick your borough =97 and you go down, where the drunk has =
been vomiting and urinating, and it's stagnating for two weeks. Well, =
that isn't as bad as the pigs."

      In just the last few years, the Finger Lakes, a region best known =
for its deep waters and bucolic beauty, has become the hog farming =
capital of New York. But with that distinction has come controversy, =
touching almost every facet of life here and casting an awkward =
spotlight on the people most associated with the animals, Mennonite =
farmers.=20

      For some residents, the proliferation of large farms, those with =
1,000 or more hogs, has adversely affected the quality of life, the =
environment, the wine business and the tourism industry. Wine and swine, =
in other words, do not mix.

      For others, though, the hog business has helped to resuscitate a =
stagnant economy and stave off suburban creep. It is simply unfortunate, =
they say, that some residents =97 particularly newcomers with lakefront =
weekend homes =97 have little appreciation for the rural life or respect =
for the Mennonites.

      "It's a way of life," said Lilly Hoover, a 20-year-old Mennonite =
who works at her family's butcher shop, Shirk Meats, in Dundee. "People =
got to realize that pork chops don't grow on trees."

      New York's hog farms =97 the largest of which, in Genesee County, =
has 6,000 animals =97 pale in comparison to those in states like Iowa =
and North Carolina, where farms have up to 50,000 hogs. And over all, =
hog farming is on the decline in New York, with the number of hogs =
dropping by 40 percent between 1992 and 1998. But not in the Finger =
Lakes, which unlike other major hog-raising areas is also a prime =
vacation spot. Yates, Seneca and Cayuga Counties increased their hog =
production by 70 percent, and now account for one- third of the state's =
60,000 hogs.

      Given that growth =97 and recent hog-farm accidents in North =
Carolina =97 several Finger Lakes communities have halted or are =
considering halting the construction of barns used for concentrated =
animal feeding operations. In Albany, meanwhile, two lawmakers from the =
New York City suburbs =97 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester =
Democrat, and Senator Vincent L. Leibell, a Putnam County Republican =97 =
are sponsoring legislation that would require farms with more than 200 =
hogs to get a pollution permit.

      "You get one really bad manure spill, and it will be one of those =
things where everyone will wonder why no one did anything leading up to =
it," Mr. Brodsky said.

      In New York, as elsewhere, these are not heady times to be an =
independent farmer, as more families, squeezed by economics, sell their =
farms to large corporations. But one exception has been Yates County, =
thanks to the Mennonites, who operate 90 percent of the dairy farms and =
the three sizable hog farms.

      "There's always this undercurrent that farming is now dominated by =
Mennonites," said Judson Reid, an agricultural educator with the Cornell =
Cooperative Extension in Yates. "But I think they're essential. They =
stabilized the economy in this county. There's no doubt about that."

      Like their better-known Anabaptist brethren, the Amish, most =
Mennonites work as farmers, craftsmen or skilled laborers. Most dress =
simply and send their children to private religious schools. Some travel =
by horse and buggy; others use cars and trucks, as long as they are =
dark.

      The Mennonites began to move to the Finger Lakes region in the =
1970's because farmland had become too expensive, and the landscape too =
commercialized, in Lancaster and other traditional bases in =
Pennsylvania. Today, there are perhaps 600 Mennonite families in the =
region, dozens of Mennonite businesses, more than two dozen Mennonite =
schools and perhaps a dozen Mennonite churches.

      One Mennonite businessman, Melvin Kurtz, moved here in 1985 from =
Ephrata, Pa., to establish a division of his family's 107-year-old feed =
mill, Keystone Mills, in Romulus, N.Y.

      To complement its production of livestock feed, Keystone Mills =
buys thousands of hogs and contracts with individual farmers to raise =
those hogs, which swell to 250 pounds from 60 in three or four months.

      The farmer provides the labor and the building, which is usually =
150 feet long by 50 feet wide, atop a six-foot manure pit. The company =
provides the feed until the hogs are shipped to Pennsylvania for =
slaughter. The farmer spreads the manure on his fields, usually once in =
the spring, once in the fall.

      The work is far from easy. Many farmers raise the hogs part time, =
relying heavily on automation, and even those who do it full time say =
that they can gross only $30,000 in a good year.

      More than two dozen farms with 1,000 or more hogs now dot the =
Finger Lakes region, almost half of them run by Mennonite families, said =
Gerald Swartley, general manager of Keystone Mills. And while "the last =
four years have seen more growth than the previous 10 years," Mr. =
Swartley said that he did not forecast any additional growth.

      To critics, though, what currently exists is already too much.

      First, there's the stench, which even hog farmers acknowledge is =
usually worse than, say, cow manure.

      People say that it forces them to keep their windows shut and =
prevents them from hanging laundry outside. It also prohibits them from =
inviting friends over for barbecues and discourages outdoor sports. They =
have complained of headaches, nausea and respiratory irritation. Some =
have even fled their homes for a few days to take comfort in the =
odorless house of a friend or relative.

      "It becomes a rather significant psychological stress to have this =
with regularity," said Thomas Bjorkman, a horticulture professor at =
Cornell and a resident of Varick. "It's like being inside an outhouse."=20

      Another major concern is the manure's impact on the environment. =
The lakes are so clean that many people drink the water, untreated. But =
pig manure contains antibiotics and other chemicals that could =
eventually contaminate the lakes or the groundwater, said Jack Ossont, a =
longtime environmental activist who in March helped found FARM Yates, =
the initials standing for Families Addressing Rural Messes.

      "There's nothing I can find in the literature that convinces me =
that hog feces are less dangerous to human health than human feces," =
said Dr. Stephen I. Rosenfeld, director of the allergy training program =
at the University of Rochester medical school, who owns a weekend house =
on Keuka Lake.

      For the 75 wineries in what bills itself as the second-largest =
wine- producing region in the country, the issue is a delicate one. The =
grape growers feel a real kinship with the hog farmers. But they worry =
about the environmental consequences. And since up to 90 percent of =
their sales come from walk-in visitors, they fret that tourists, ever =
fickle, may be repulsed by the odor =97 and spread the bad news, said =
Mr. DeMarco of Seneca Shore Wine Cellars.

      Anne Parker, executive director of the Finger Lakes Wine Country =
Tourism Marketing Association, agreed. "You like to think of a wine =
region as something that's a little bit more upscale, and it's kind of =
hard to be upscale if the air doesn't smell too good," she said.=20

      In New York, "right to farm" laws are intended to preserve =
agricultural districts like the Finger Lakes, and many hog farmers here =
are very opposed to regulations that would limit their livelihood. It =
would also cost the average hog farmer in the area an extra $25,000 to =
$30,000 a year to comply with more stringent requirements, said Mark =
James, executive director of the Finger Lakes office of the New York =
Farm Bureau, a nonprofit advocacy group.

      Some hog farmers here have already spent more than $2,000 on food =
additives in an effort to reduce the odor, and they tell their neighbors =
in advance when they plan to spread manure. Four years ago, one farmer, =
Ed Hartman, began inviting neighbors to a pig roast at his Harty Hog =
Farms in Waterloo, because "once we can talk to them, they can =
understand what we do."

      Still, Mr. Hartman said he was frustrated by what he called =
misperceptions about what he does, and he eagerly offered two visitors a =
tour of his farm. Like other hog farmers, he has groused about animal =
rights advocates who have criticized the hog farms as inhumane, =
unsanitary corporate factories, and new residents who have romanticized =
rural life as odor-free.

      "The community is so far removed from what farming is," said =
Stewart Tietjen, a 38-year-old Mennonite farmer in Dundee who began =
raising 1,000 pigs in February. "They think farming is like the =
children's books where you have these red- gabled barns with a few pigs =
and one cow. Well, you can't survive like that. You need 1,000 pigs to =
survive."

      Until recently, the relationship between the Mennonites and the =
outside community here was amicable, and sometimes quite close. But hog =
farming has strained the relationship. While most Mennonites say they =
cannot fathom why people have been complaining about rural odors in a =
rural area, hog-farm critics say that the Mennonites have different =
values, rooted in a not-so-modern world.

      On a recent languid summer day, for instance, Joan Teichner, a =
member of the Varick Town Board, listened to the concerns of Virginia =
Olsowske, who lives a quarter-mile from a Mennonite hog farm, and within =
a mile of three hog farms.

      In 1997, Mrs. Teichner, a music teacher, became the first woman =
elected to the Town Board, after pledging to restrict hog farming. And =
though Mrs. Olsowske grew up on a dairy farm, she said that pig manure =
was a different beast altogether, permeating clothes, leaving a =
lingering taste in one's mouth and ruining many an outdoor activity.

      "What's irritating is that we built the home from the ground up, =
and you can't enjoy it because of them," Mrs. Olsowske said, pointing =
out the window to a nearby Mennonite farm. "They have no compassion for =
the neighbors, in my book."

      On the other side of Seneca Lake, at dusk, the Colegrove family, =
of nearby Phelps, were enjoying a lakeshore picnic and swim when they =
paused to talk hogs. Mark Colegrove, 35, a truck driver, said that he =
had worked on a hog farm as a teenager. And while he has tremendous =
respect for the farmers, he also said he cared deeply about the lake =
that his daughters, Samantha and Jolene, now enjoy.

      "It's a half-and-half situation," he said. "I think they ought to =
limit the size of the farms so it doesn't have an impact on the lake."

      His wife, Diane, also 35, did not disagree. But she added that the =
controversy, at its most basic level, signaled a growing divide between =
people who have competing visions for the Finger Lakes.

      "Sometimes I wonder," she said, "if it's not the farms that smell =
bad, but the people who think it should smell better."

      Swartley, general manager of Keystone Mills. And while "the last =
four=20
      years have seen more growth than the previous 10 years," Mr. =
Swartley said=20
      that he did not forecast any additional growth.</P>
      <P>To critics, though, what currently exists is already too =
much.</P>
      <P>First, there's the stench, which even hog farmers acknowledge =
is=20
      usually worse than, say, cow manure.</P>
      <P>People say that it forces them to keep their windows shut and =
prevents=20
      them from hanging laundry outside. It also prohibits them from =
inviting=20
      friends over for barbecues and discourages outdoor sports. They =
have=20
      complained of headaches, nausea and respiratory irritation. Some =
have even=20
      fled their homes for a few days to take comfort in the odorless =
house of a=20
      friend or relative.</P>
      <P>"It becomes a rather significant psychological stress to have =
this with=20
      regularity," said Thomas Bjorkman, a horticulture professor at =
Cornell and=20
      a resident of Varick. "It's like being inside an outhouse." </P>
      <P>Another major concern is the manure's impact on the =
environment. The=20
      lakes are so clean that many people drink the water, untreated. =
But pig=20
      manure contains antibiotics and other chemicals that could =
eventually=20
      contaminate the lakes or the groundwater, said Jack Ossont, a =
longtime=20
      environmental activist who in March helped found FARM Yates, the =
initials=20
      standing for Families Addressing Rural Messes.</P>
      <P>"There's nothing I can find in the literature that convinces me =
that=20
      hog feces are less dangerous to human health than human feces," =
said Dr.=20
      Stephen I. Rosenfeld, director of the allergy training program at =
the=20
      University of Rochester medical school, who owns a weekend house =
on Keuka=20
      Lake.</P>
      <P>For the 75 wineries in what bills itself as the second-largest =
wine-=20
      producing region in the country, the issue is a delicate one. The =
grape=20
      growers feel a real kinship with the hog farmers. But they worry =
about the=20
      environmental consequences. And since up to 90 percent of their =
sales come=20
      from walk-in visitors, they fret that tourists, ever fickle, may =
be=20
      repulsed by the odor =97 and spread the bad news, said Mr. DeMarco =
of Seneca=20
      Shore Wine Cellars.</P>
      <P>Anne Parker, executive director of the Finger Lakes Wine =
Country=20
      Tourism Marketing Association, agreed. "You like to think of a =
wine region=20
      as something that's a little bit more upscale, and it's kind of =
hard to be=20
      upscale if the air doesn't smell too good," she said. </P>
      <P>In New York, "right to farm" laws are intended to preserve =
agricultural=20
      districts like the Finger Lakes, and many hog farmers here are =
very=20
      opposed to regulations that would limit their livelihood. It would =
also=20
      cost the average hog farmer in the area an extra $25,000 to =
$30,000 a year=20
      to comply with more stringent requirements, said Mark James, =
executive=20
      director of the Finger Lakes office of the New York Farm Bureau, a =

      nonprofit advocacy group.</P>
      <P>Some hog farmers here have already spent more than $2,000 on =
food=20
      additives in an effort to reduce the odor, and they tell their =
neighbors=20
      in advance when they plan to spread manure. Four years ago, one =
farmer, Ed=20
      Hartman, began inviting neighbors to a pig roast at his Harty Hog =
Farms in=20
      Waterloo, because "once we can talk to them, they can understand =
what we=20
      do."</P>
      <P>Still, Mr. Hartman said he was frustrated by what he called=20
      misperceptions about what he does, and he eagerly offered two =
visitors a=20
      tour of his farm. Like other hog farmers, he has groused about =
animal=20
      rights advocates who have criticized the hog farms as inhumane, =
unsanitary=20
      corporate factories, and new residents who have romanticized rural =
life as=20
      odor-free.</P>
      <P>"The community is so far removed from what farming is," said =
Stewart=20
      Tietjen, a 38-year-old Mennonite farmer in Dundee who began =
raising 1,000=20
      pigs in February. "They think farming is like the children's books =
where=20
      you have these red- gabled barns with a few pigs and one cow. =
Well, you=20
      can't survive like that. You need 1,000 pigs to survive."</P>
      <P>Until recently, the relationship between the Mennonites and the =
outside=20
      community here was amicable, and sometimes quite close. But hog =
farming=20
      has strained the relationship. While most Mennonites say they =
cannot=20
      fathom why people have been complaining about rural odors in a =
rural area,=20
      hog-farm critics say that the Mennonites have different values, =
rooted in=20
      a not-so-modern world.</P>
      <P>On a recent languid summer day, for instance, Joan Teichner, a =
member=20
      of the Varick Town Board, listened to the concerns of Virginia =
Olsowske,=20
      who lives a quarter-mile from a Mennonite hog farm, and within a =
mile of=20
      three hog farms.</P>
      <P>In 1997, Mrs. Teichner, a music teacher, became the first woman =
elected=20
      to the Town Board, after pledging to restrict hog farming. And =
though Mrs.=20
      Olsowske grew up on a dairy farm, she said that pig manure was a =
different=20
      beast altogether, permeating clothes, leaving a lingering taste in =
one's=20
      mouth and ruining many an outdoor activity.</P>
      <P>"What's irritating is that we built the home from the ground =
up, and=20
      you can't enjoy it because of them," Mrs. Olsowske said, pointing =
out the=20
      window to a nearby Mennonite farm. "They have no compassion for =
the=20
      neighbors, in my book."</P>
      <P>On the other side of Seneca Lake, at dusk, the Colegrove =
family, of=20
      nearby Phelps, were enjoying a lakeshore picnic and swim when they =
paused=20
      to talk hogs. Mark Colegrove, 35, a truck driver, said that he had =
worked=20
      on a hog farm as a teenager. And while he has tremendous respect =
for the=20
      farmers, he also said he cared deeply about the lake that his =
daughters,=20
      Samantha and Jolene, now enjoy.</P>
      <P>"It's a half-and-half situation," he said. "I think they ought =
to limit=20
      the size of the farms so it doesn't have an impact on the =
lake."</P>
      <P>His wife, Diane, also 35, did not disagree. But she added that =
the=20
      controversy, at its most basic level, signaled a growing divide =
between=20
      people who have competing visions for the Finger Lakes.</P>
      <P>"Sometimes I wonder," she said, "if it's not the farms that =
smell bad,=20
      but the people who think it should smell =
better."</P></NYT_TEXT><BR>
