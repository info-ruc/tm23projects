nice start! like that elephant;
probably calling  it query caching instead
of opt is better as it is more concrete.


still need to work on an abstract (as a group).

you don't want to have anyone looking at the
site to have to go through each week's agenda
to figure out status, main documents, and such.

so more prominent on the main page, 
there needs to be urls to the 
the main issues coming out of each weekly meeting
pulled into appropriate main places, such as

- reading resources:
  under one url below.
-  or, the documents that you work on, as you
   work on them, such as  XQUERY EXAMPLES you
  collect and you walk through together.
  link those in as well.
- design document
- talk; (partial) report as produced per semester.

look at another  site for other mqp teams
for ideas on that.
