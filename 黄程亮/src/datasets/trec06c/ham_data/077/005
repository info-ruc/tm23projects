Indian reservations are the ghettos of the great plains: isolated pockets of
poor dark-skinned people surrounded by relatively affluent blonde whites
of Scandinavian descent.  They have all of the social ills normally associated
with inner city slums (poverty, unemployment, petty crime, alcoholism, drug
abuse, domestic violence) as well as their outward manifestations (federal
housing projects, pawn shops,  detox clinics, crisis centers and dozens of
missions trying to help by pure dint of religion).  The word from the
eastbounders so far has been unanimous: don't camp in city parks on the
reservations.

I entered the Fort Peck Indian Reservation 30 miles after crossing the Montana
state line (yes, I got a picture of the bicycle leaning against the sign).  About
15 miles later I hit the little town of Brockton, MT and decided to stop at the
convenience store there and perform the buy-Gatorade-and-fill-my-bottles ritual
once again.  There's nobody in the store except the woman working the register
and a guy who appears to be just loitering there.  I buy my Gatorade, fill my
bottles, make some small talk with the woman at the register about the "4-for-2,
contact your Congressman" sign outside the store (they want four lanes for
this stretch of US route 2).  I walk outside to my bicycle, and the loiterer follows.
"Do you have a dollar?" he asks.  "Yes, several," I reply and start drinking my
Gatorade.  "Will you give me one?" he asks.  At home, I walk through swarms of
pan-handlers every day in Harvard Square and I have about as bad a case of
compassion fatigue as it is possible to get: "No", I reply.  "How about a quarter?"
he asks.  At this point, I just want to finish my Gatorade in peace, so I hand him
50 cents and hope he will go away.  But no, still unsatisfied he decides to try
a rather blunt intimidation tactic: "Don't you ever get scared, riding that bicycle
all alone?".  Two can play at that game, I thought: "I'm not alone," I lied, "there
are four guys behind me.  I told them I'd wait for them here."  "Oh," he says, and
overwhelmingly outnumbered, leaves.  I think I have guessed his MO: he waits at
the convenience store for strangers to happen along. All the locals have heard his
sob story before and stopped giving a long time ago.

One important tidbit of information I got from the woman at the store was that
the forecast for tonight is for crop-damaging hail, so I wasn't really tempted to
camp at all.  It was hard to believe during the sunny and pleasant afternoon,
but sure enough, now something is really moving in with a vengeance.

The westbound Empire Builder passed me in Brockton at 1:15 PM MDT.  Assuming
that it covers the remaining 35 miles to Wolf Point in half an hour (a bit generous,
I admit), he was running more than two hours late, a fairly typical Amtrak
performance, unfortunately.  (Yes, of course I have an Empire Builder schedule with
me.  I'm not going to ride 600+ miles exactly parallel to its route without bringing a
schedule!)
