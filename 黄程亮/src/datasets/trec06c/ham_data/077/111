   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

  * Systems running the following products that use Gauntlet Firewall

     * Gauntlet for Unix versions 5.x
     * PGP e-ppliance 300 series version 1.0
     * McAfee e-ppliance 100 and 120 series

Overview

   A vulnerability for a remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists
   in Gauntlet Firewall by PGP Security.

I. Description

   The buffer overflow occurs in the smap/smapd and CSMAP daemons.
   According to PGP Security, these daemons are responsible for
   handling email transactions for both inbound and outbound email.

   On September 04, 2001, PGP Security released a security bulletin
   and patches for this vulnerability. For more information, please
   see

          http://www.pgp.com/support/product-advisories/csmap.asp
          http://www.pgp.com/naicommon/download/upgrade/upgrades-patch.asp
          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/206723

II. Impact

   An intruder can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
   corresponding daemon.  Additionally, firewalls often have trust
   relationships with other network devices. An intruder who
   compromises a firewall may be able to leverage this trust to
   compromise other devices on the network or to make changes to the
   network configuration.

III. Solution
