CERT Advisory CA-2001-27 Format String Vulnerability in CDE ToolTalk

   Original release date: October 5, 2001
   Last revised: Thu Oct 5 14:17:55 EDT 2001
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.


Systems Affected

     * Systems running CDE ToolTalk


Overview

   There is a remotely exploitable format string vulnerability in the CDE
   ToolTalk  RPC  database  service.  This vulnerability could be used to
   crash  the  service or execute arbitrary code, potentially allowing an
   intruder  to  gain  root  access.  This vulnerability is documented in
   VU#595507.


I. Description

   The  Common  Desktop Environment (CDE) is an integrated graphical user
   interface  that runs on Unix and Linux operating systems. CDE ToolTalk
   is  a  message  brokering  system  that  provides  an architecture for
   applications   to   communicate  with  each  other  across  hosts  and
   platforms.  The ToolTalk RPC database server, rpc.ttdbserverd, manages
   communication  between  ToolTalk  applications.  For  more information
   about CDE, see

          http://www.opengroup.org/cde/
          http://www.opengroup.org/desktop/faq/

   There is a remotely exploitable format string vulnerability in the CDE
   ToolTalk  RPC  database  server.  While handling an error condition, a
   syslog(3)  function  call  is  made  without providing a format string
   specifier  argument.  Since  rpc.ttdbserverd does not perform adequate
   input  validation  or  provide the format string specifier argument, a
   crafted  RPC  request  containing  format  string  specifiers  will be
   interpreted  by the vulnerable syslog(3) function call. Such a request
   can  be  designed  to  overwrite  specific  locations  in memory, thus
   executing code with the privileges of rpc.ttdbserverd, typically root.

   The  vulnerability  was  discovered by Internet Security Systems (ISS)
   X-Force. For more information, see

          http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise98.php

   This  vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CAN-2001-00717 by
   the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) group:

          http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0717

   Many  common UNIX systems ship with CDE ToolTalk installed and enabled
   by  default.  The  rpcinfo  command  may help determine if a system is
   running the ToolTalk RPC database service:

          $ rpcinfo -p hostname

   The  program  number  for the ToolTalk RPC database service is 100083.
   References  to  this  number in the output from rpcinfo or in /etc/rpc
   may  indicate  that  the ToolTalk RPC database service is running. Any
   system  that  does  not  run  the ToolTalk RPC database service is not
   vulnerable to this problem.


II. Impact

   An  attacker  can  execute  arbitrary  code with the privileges of the
   rpc.ttdbserverd process, typically root.


III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Appendix  A  contains  information  from  vendors  who  have  provided
   information  for  this  advisory.  We  will  update the appendix as we
   receive more information. If a vendor's name does not appear, then the
   CERT/CC  did  not  hear  from  that vendor. Please contact your vendor
   directly.

Block access to vulnerable service

   Until  patches are available and can be applied, you may wish to block
   access to the RPC portmapper service and the ToolTalk RPC service from
   untrusted  networks  such  as  the internet. Using a firewall or other
   packet-filtering   technology,   block  the  ports  used  by  the  RPC
   portmapper  and  ToolTalk  RPC  services.  The  RPC portmapper service
   typically  runs on ports 111/tcp and 111/udp. The ToolTalk RPC service
   may  be configured to use port 692/tcp or another port as indicated in
   output from the rpcinfo command. Keep in mind that blocking ports at a
   network  perimeter  does  not  protect the vulnerable service from the
   internal   network.   It  is  important  to  understand  your  network
   configuration  and  service  requirements before deciding what changes
   are appropriate.


Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  When  vendors  report  new  information  to the CERT/CC, we
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below, we have not received their
   comments.
