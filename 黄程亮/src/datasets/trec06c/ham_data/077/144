Celeste,
I'm sorry I don't know of any workshops or conferences but I am also working with highschool science teachers on lesson study and also I've seen that the Bellevue schools in Washington (they have a website but I don't know what it is but I found it through google by using the terms bellevue and lesson study) where their high school teachers are also involved in lesson study.  If you find anything I'd love to know about it.
