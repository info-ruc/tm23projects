CERT Advisory CA-2001-28 Automatic Execution of Macros

   Original release date: October 08, 2001
   Last revised: -- Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

   Systems running:
     * Windows
          + Microsoft Excel 2000
          + Microsoft Excel 2002
          + Microsoft PowerPoint 2000
          + Microsoft PowerPoint 2002
     * Macintosh
          + Microsoft Excel 98
          + Microsoft Excel 2001
          + Microsoft PowerPoint 98
          + Microsoft PowerPoint 2001

Overview

   An intruder can include a specially crafted macro in a Microsoft
   Excel or PowerPoint document that can avoid detection and run
   automatically regardless of the security settings specified by the
   user.

I. Description

   Microsoft Excel and PowerPoint scan documents when they are opened
   and check for the existence of macros. If the document contains
   macros, the user running Excel or PowerPoint is alerted and asked
   if he would like the macros to be run. However, Microsoft Excel and
   PowerPoint may not detect malformed macros, so a user can
   unknowingly run macros containing malicious code when opening an
   Excel or PowerPoint document.

   An intruder who can entice or deceive a victim into opening a
   document using a vulnerable version of Excel or PowerPoint could
   take any action the victim could take, including, but not limited
   to

     * reading, deleting, or modifying data, either locally or on open
       file shares
     * modifying security settings (including macro virus protection
       settings)
     * sending electronic mail
     * posting data to or retrieving data from web sites

   For more information, please see

     http://securityresponse.symantec.com/avcenter/security/Content/
          2001.10.04.html
     http://www.microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/tech
          net/security/bulletin/MS01-050.asp

   Given the strong potential for widespread abuse of this
   vulnerability, we strongly recommend that you apply patches as soon
   as you are able. For example, the Melissa virus which spread in
   March of 1999 used social engineering to convince victims to
   execute a macro embedded in a Microsoft Word document.  For more
   information, see the CERT/CC Advisory listed below.

     http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-04.html

   As a general practice, everyone should be aware of the potential
   damage that Trojan horses and other kinds of malicious code can
   cause to any platform. For more information, see

     http://www.cert.org/advisories/CA-1999-02.html

   This vulnerability has been assigned the identifier CAN-2001-0718
   by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) group:

     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0718

II. Impact

   An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system with
   the privileges of the victim running Excel or PowerPoint.

III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Appendix A contains information from vendors who have provided
   information for this advisory.  We will update the appendix as we
   receive more information. If a vendor's name does not appear, then
   the CERT/CC did not hear from that vendor. Please contact your
   vendor directly.

   Until a patch can be applied, and as a general practice, we
   recommend using caution when opening attachments. However, it is
   important to note that relying on the "From" line in an electronic
   mail message is not sufficient to authenticate the origin of the
   document.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This appendix contains information provided by vendors for this
   advisory.  When vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we
   update this section and note the changes in our revision
   history. If a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not
   received their comments.
