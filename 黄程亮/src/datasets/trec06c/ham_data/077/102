To All
	I have been interested in lesson study for 4-5 years, since I first learned
of it in Stigler's study which exerpted in the American Educator as
Polishing the Mirror.  I have since read "The Teaching Gap" and also
attended the Open House at the Japanese School in Greenwich, Connecticut
which was set up by Dr. Clea Fernandez at Columbia Teacher's College.
	A group at my high school started a lesson study in mathematics last year.
We had a diverse group of 5 teachers - from NBCT to new student teachers.
It took us a while to get started, but we began to make some progress by the
end of the year.  Unfortunately, we have no extra funding, so we only met
about \twice per month for one hour.  Due to issues of state standards, we
decided to focus our efforts on developing performance assessments to meet
our state standards, and instruction which will support students reaching
these standards.
	I would be very interested in discussing others' experience in this area.
(One thing I found interesting at the Open House was in response to my
question about the use of lesson study in high school classes in Japan, they
said that everyone was too focused on tests, and that it was rarely used.
