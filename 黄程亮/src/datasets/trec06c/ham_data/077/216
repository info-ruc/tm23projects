ABR:

This paper presents a new routing protocol, Associative-Based Routing
(ABR), that is in between broadcast and point-to-point routing.  ABR
does not attempt to maintain current route information at every node.
Routing decisions are made at the DEST and only one route is used,
while other routes remain open for other communication.

Routing choices are based on the associativity property--a MH's association
with its neighbors will change when it is migrating and be stable when
the MH is dormant.  The best route is composed of all (ideally) nodes
with high associativity (dormant nodes), based on the assumption that
this route will likely be longer lived than routes composed with low
associativity (migrating nodes).  This is one of the first papers that
we have read that gives actual data from a sample distributed system
(Active Badge System), which the authors believe that for practical
mobile users, some dormant time will be spent before migration.
Interestingly, ABR can be applied to BS-oriented WLANS to improve
robustness when BS failures occur.

In addition to conventional metrics (recovery time, minimum hop,
propagation delay, loop avoidance, & link capacity) this author
introduces longevity of a route, relaying load of INs supporting
existing routes, and knowledge of link capacities of the selected
route.

Their target model is migration based, laptops or PDAs inside of
buildings.  The simulation appears to be on par with the other
simulation environments we have seen in the other papers.  Figures
even have statistical confidence intervals!

This paper was very extensive in its background information and
discussions, and the analysis was good.  The biggest complaint that
this paper was perhaps too extensive--i.e. if every paper in this
field was 40 pages (or 20 double column) it would be ridiculous.
