>Dear Jane and Lisa,

	I am not doing a lesson study with high school, but am 
planning on using the lesson study design of professional development 
as a catalyst for helping elem teachers reflect on and improve the 
daily interactions with students in math. I have yet to write my 
proposal for my dissertation, but this is my intent. So if anyone out 
there is doing any part (math related, interactions, OR elementary) I 
think we would have things to share.
	I have found a book, Teaching and Learning in Japan eds. 
Rohlen and LeTendre which may be helpful. I also am planning on 
attending the AERA conference next spring in New Orleans, and perhaps 
this could be a meeting place for those interested in implementing 
Japanese lesson Study in the US. Any thoughts?

>Dear Jane,
>I hope to begin a very small lesson study with high school science
>teachers in the fall.  I would love to be in contact with you about this
>as it's my first attempt.
>
>I'd love to ask you some questions about how you introduced it to
>the teachers in your previous lesson study.  For example, a lot of
>people I've talked to about lesson study respond "isn't that just
>lesson planning.  we already do that."  Is it worth explaining how
>lesson study is different or just accept that as a beginning and let
>them see how it is different?
>
>Also, did you ever have problems with the discussion where for
>example teachers didn't necessarily really want to think through
>and discuss the "why" for their decisions?
>
>One final thought re: your work. I know somebody who has done
>lesson study in Math for GED teachers.  She is very committed to
>lesson study and had a great experience.  It's not a formal
>highschool setting but still might be valuable.  I will forward your
>e-mail to her.  Let me know if you want to pursue that discussion.
