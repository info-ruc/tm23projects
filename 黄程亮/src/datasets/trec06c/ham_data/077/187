Dear Colleagues,

I just learned that the Greenwich Japanese School community lost fathers in
last week's tragedy.

If you would like to express your condolence, you can write gwjs@gwjs.org
or send your mail to:

The Greenwich Japanese School
15 Ridgeway
Greenwich, CT  06831

Please share with the school community a little information about yourself.

Thank you.

Patsy
