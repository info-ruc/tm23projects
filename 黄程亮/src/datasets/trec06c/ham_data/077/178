Lily's Abstract

Ace-XQ is a web-based XML query engine. XML is a new language for the web that allows data to be stored in a specified format in a regular text file. This allows it to be queried much more efficiently than a regular HTML document. The Ace-XQ system not only allows users to query XML documents, but it stores the results from these queries in its cache and uses them to answer future queries. This query caching process allows many queries to be answered much faster than they would be normally since the query engine can retrieve many of the results from its cache rather than having to access the data across the network as in a typical search engine.(To be modified...)
