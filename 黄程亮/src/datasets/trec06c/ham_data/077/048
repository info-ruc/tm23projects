Dear Jane,
I hope to begin a very small lesson study with high school science 
teachers in the fall.  I would love to be in contact with you about this 
as it's my first attempt.

I'd love to ask you some questions about how you introduced it to 
the teachers in your previous lesson study.  For example, a lot of 
people I've talked to about lesson study respond "isn't that just 
lesson planning.  we already do that."  Is it worth explaining how 
lesson study is different or just accept that as a beginning and let 
them see how it is different?

Also, did you ever have problems with the discussion where for 
example teachers didn't necessarily really want to think through 
and discuss the "why" for their decisions?

One final thought re: your work. I know somebody who has done 
lesson study in Math for GED teachers.  She is very committed to 
lesson study and had a great experience.  It's not a formal 
highschool setting but still might be valuable.  I will forward your 
e-mail to her.  Let me know if you want to pursue that discussion.
