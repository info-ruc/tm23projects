Hi Jane

I am working with 15 teachers in a high school setting in the topic 
of Algebra. We started last year under a grant in California. But we 
have started our work around the unit or chapter. We pay for 
student-free days and sit down and plan the entire unit (chapter) 
together. We have done two units so far and this year we will do 
four. I found thus far that teachers are more engaged in improving 
their teaching in this form of "unit study" than with the traditional 
staff development work I was doing before with them.

I am not sure what topics you are working on, but if it is in algebra 
or even pre-algebra it would be great if we could share ideas and 
products.
