Linda,
My apologies for responding so late. This email address was supposedly
canceled as of Sept. 1 and I have just this morning discovered that it
remains active (a friend stood me up when indeed, she'd emailed me to this
old address!).
So, yes, we have a wonderful web site - www.landstewardshipproject.org.
Please peruse it and shout back with questions or other inquiries.
We're very happy to help promote your events via our bimonthly newsletter
and our web site calendar. On occasion, we'll help promote something non-LSP
to our members, but of course, it very much depends on what and who etc.
Just feel free to contact us as things arise; we're pretty flexible and we
try to be creative in how we help!

sincerely,
caroline
