The Outlook
The Outlook
The federal budget surplus is rapidly shrinking. That's a good thing, =
but you wouldn't know it from the debate in Washington, where the =
standard recession-fighting prescription is endangered by a newfound =
obsession with the Social Security surplus.

      1Amid a softening economy, how important is preserving the federal =
budget surplus? Participate in the Question of the Day.
    =20
Most economists accept that, at least in theory, the government should =
offset contracting private activity in downturns by reducing its tax =
take and by boosting spending, a policy advocated by British economist =
John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s. Yet after the administration said last =
week the surplus this year and next will be less than expected, though =
still among the largest in U.S. history, budget director Mitch Daniels =
began demanding spending cuts. Democrats responded by condemning anew =
the tax cut. Both agree the Social Security surplus -- the excess of =
Social Security receipts over benefits, estimated at $157 billion this =
year -- must not be touched, thus barring the government from running a =
deficit in the rest of its budget.

On Wall Street, where you'd think preserving surpluses would score =
points, instead it's considered a really bad idea. "If the economy needs =
help today, fiscal stimulus may well be a better bargain than mindless =
fealty to an accounting fiction about Social Security and Medicare trust =
funds," remarked Neal Soss, Credit Suisse First Boston's chief =
economist. Jan Hatzius of Goldman Sachs adds that President Bush's =
defense of the Social Security surplus "may very well stand in the way =
of a sensible, countercyclical fiscal policy. After all, a temporary =
on-budget deficit would be a price well worth paying for averting a =
recession."

But don't let last week's rhetoric in Washington fool you. Keynesianism =
is not dead. It's enjoying a revival in some of the oddest places. The =
International Monetary Fund, whose austerity prescriptions are often =
blamed for deepening the late-1990s Asian crisis, praises the U.S. tax =
cut as "appropriate and timely." Meanwhile, signs that Germany and =
France may overshoot their deficit targets have fueled talk of relaxing =
Europe's strict limits on deficits.

But Keynesianism's oddest standard-bearers are President Bush and the =
supply sider who advises him, Lawrence Lindsey. Mr. Lindsey once labeled =
Keynes's advocacy of countercyclical fiscal policy "utopian." But last =
month, he said it was only "common sense economics" not only to let the =
budget deteriorate in a slowdown, but to push it along with a tax cut. =
He compared Democratic critics of the tax cut to Herbert Hoover, who =
raised taxes in 1932.

President Bush is committed to preserving the Social Security surplus, =
Mr. Lindsey said in an interview last week, but he'd make an exception =
for war or recession. "I don't think his is an absolutist view here," =
Mr. Lindsey said. If it turns out the U.S. is in recession, "then I =
think he'd be willing to reconsider."

This seems to run counter to Mr. Daniels's demand for spending =
restraint, but then not many analysts expect the bipartisan defense of =
the Social Security surplus to prevail against the ingrained momentum =
for more spending.

As long as the economy looks sick, that's probably a good thing. =
Democratic and Republican economists agree that trying to rope off the =
Social Security surplus when the economy is sinking is bad economics. =
Harvard University's Martin Feldstein, who was chairman of President =
Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, thinks the record on fine-tuning =
the economy through countercyclical fiscal policy is awful, but says, =
"It's hard to see why we would want to try arbitrarily fine-tuning the =
economy in the wrong direction."

Princeton University's Alan Blinder, who sat on Mr. Clinton's council, =
says from the economics angle, an even bigger short-term tax cut would =
have been the right policy. But this time, good politics trumps good =
economics. "When you look out into the future, we really need that =
revenue for the Social Security system. To win politically you need a =
symbol that would attract politicians and voters. It turns out that =
saving the whole Social Security surplus is a pretty good candidate for =
that. This isn't something that comes out of the economic textbooks, but =
the political textbooks," Mr. Binder says.

On this, Mr. Lindsey agrees. There's no economic significance to a =
balanced budget or any given level of the Social Security surplus. "But =
it turns out there's value in the political process to having a number =
that everyone agrees to." It used to be zero; now it's $157 billion.

For this fealty to balanced budgets, thank the straitjacket of deficits =
that since 1982 not only made Keynesian countercyclical initiatives =
impossible, but often led to the opposite.

In 1990, President Bush senior had to raise taxes during a recession. =
Three years later, with the recovery still looking fragile, President =
Clinton had to abandon a $30 billion stimulus package he'd hoped would =
reduce the sting of his own tax increase. With the help of Federal =
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, those moves kicked off a prolonged =
decline in interest rates, 10 years of prosperity and, ironically, the =
budget surpluses that today make Keynesian-style stimulus possible.

If, as many economists think, the 2001 tax cut has come just in time to =
head off recession, it may give Keynesian fine-tuning its biggest jolt =
of credibility in decades.
