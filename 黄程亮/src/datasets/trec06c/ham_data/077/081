As Argentina Seeks Relief, Buenos Aires
Touts Bonds That Many Don't Want
By MATT MOFFETT=20
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


LA PLATA, Argentina -- In a daring, decadelong economic experiment, =
Argentina has held to a single, simple monetary rule: One peso equals =
one dollar.


      Carlos Ruckauf, governor of Buenos Aires province, with patacon in =
hand. =20
But as Argentina endures a financial calamity that has jarred markets =
around the world, the country's vast Buenos Aires province is suddenly =
facing a more complicated financial calculation: What is one patacon =
worth?

The patacon is a wallet-size negotiable bond that the cash-strapped =
provincial government wants to use to pay part of what it owes to public =
employees and suppliers. Complete with an engraving of Daro Rocha, the =
mustachioed founder of this provincial capital, the patacon looks like =
legal tender. And, if all goes as planned, the patacon will start being =
used as money Tuesday, in an area accounting for one-third of =
Argentina's population and economic output.

'An Act of Vandalism'

But many workers and businesses are outraged about the plan. Mobs of =
unemployed protesters, known as piqueteros, have set up roadblocks that =
paralyzed major thoroughfares in the province, which encompasses =
suburban Buenos Aires and a Nevada-size area of the surrounding pampas. =
The teachers union has decried the patacon as "an act of vandalism =
against wages," and the rank and file walked out of classrooms. Dozens =
of merchants and state contractors have flat out refused to accept =
patacons at face value.

The bonds pay annual interest of 7% to those who hold them to maturity =
next year, and the federal government has said it will accept them as =
payment on taxes, as well. But the country's long history of financial =
turbulence, resolved only by the dollar-backed peso, has made residents =
wary of anything that gives off a whiff of funny money. Many fear that =
patacons won't be widely accepted or will quickly lose their value.

Yet the consequences of not having enough pesos circulating are also =
proving devastating. Lacking the means to pay suppliers, provincial =
hospitals have been forced to ration food and have deprived cancer =
patients of medicine. "The question is whether bad money is better than =
no money at all," says Vitali Carlos, a union leader.

The Definition of Money

Argentina's patacon predicament demonstrates how confusing -- and =
crucial -- the very definition of money has become in interlinked global =
markets. An intractable three-year recession, combined with a =
speculative wave from Wall Street, has strained the limits of =
Argentina's "currency board" system of pegging the peso firmly to the =
dollar. Under the rules of the currency board, the central bank can't =
print pesos unless it has dollars to back them. During the first half of =
the 1990s, Argentina's dollar-backed peso not only vanquished inflation =
that had reached 5,000% annually -- it also ignited an economic =
expansion exceeded only by China's during the period. But more recently, =
as several Asian and Latin American countries devalued their currencies, =
the peso made Argentina too pricey a place to buy goods from or invest =
in. Finally, this year the local and international lenders that had been =
keeping Argentina afloat cut it off. Now, Argentina is negotiating with =
the International Monetary Fund to obtain further aid to help keep the =
country going. With its travails, Argentina, for a while seen as a model =
of free-market reform in Latin America, has shaken emerging markets =
around the world and hamstrung stocks of U.S. companies that had bet on =
the peso policy.

The crisis also has injected a note of desperation in the tone of =
Argentine authorities. "Perhaps I will pay for the crime of speaking the =
truth," Buenos Aires Gov. Carlos Ruckauf said. "It seems to me that the =
fact that Argentina went broke is being hidden from Argentines."

Federal Wiggling

Patacons are a stopgap measure in a country that can't print money, =
can't raise it through taxation during a recession and can't borrow it =
from financial markets. Provincial officials say one reason they have =
been forced to resort to the patacon is the federal government's own =
wiggling on the currency board.

The province was set to raise some badly needed revenue with an =
international bond offering in June. But in mid-June, federal Economy =
Minister Domingo Cavallo, the original architect of the currency board, =
committed what is widely seen as a major policy stumble: He announced =
that Argentina was tinkering with the peso-dollar peg to grant exporters =
what was, in effect, a 7% currency devaluation, intending to make their =
goods more competitive abroad.

International investors were so unnerved that Buenos Aires province had =
to cancel its bond issue, says the Buenos Aires economy chief, Jorge =
Sarghini. Without the fresh capital, the province hasn't been able to =
pay employees or contractors for weeks.

In downtown La Plata, merchants and shoppers are divided over whether =
the patacon is merely monetary sleight of hand or their salvation. The =
commercial district, several blocks of sprawling mission-style buildings =
subdivided into dozens of shops, once thrived on the trade of civil =
servants and factory workers. With the recession, some stores have been =
boarded up and political graffiti have proliferated. A typical message: =
"Fuera Ruckauf." (Out with Ruckauf.)

Some merchants are taking a proactive stance on the patacon. "Yes, we =
accept patacons," says the sign outside a Volkswagen dealership. Buenos =
Aires McDonald's restaurants are offering a meal they call the =
Patacombo. The notice outside the woman's clothing store Orix specifies =
that it will take the provincial paper at 100% of face value.

"These days, if customers want to pay us in tomatoes, I'll consider =
making a deal," says Mariano de Seta, the local cellphone dealer for =
Telefonica of Spain. He says sales have fallen to about 40 phones a =
month from three times as many at the beginning of this year.

Other businesses are more skeptical. The electric utility will take =
patacons, but only up to 60% of each bill. At a department store called =
Todo Vale $2 (translation: Everything Costs $2), management doesn't even =
want to look at the bonds. "My suppliers will laugh at me and then cut =
me off," says Rosana Gomez, an owner. In a telephone survey of 350 =
retailers, 40% said they would accept it; most of the rest weren't sure.

Federal authorities have become concerned that several other tapped-out =
states might flood the market with scrip, further undermining the peso. =
So Mr. Cavallo said last week that the federal government would issue a =
single bond that will eventually take the place of the patacon and any =
other provincial bonds.

Many industrialists cringe at the thought of the patacon, especially =
during a financial crisis. "This is not the time to be playing around =
with money -- or something that looks like money," says Francisco =
Gliemmo, president of a provincial industry group. Since March, when =
savers and investors were badly spooked by the country's prospects, =
Central Bank reserves have fallen $10 billion to about $17 billion. But =
Argentina still has sufficient resources to cover its monetary base; =
Argentina's currency-board law also permits, in a pinch, the use of =
government securities as backing for a portion of its money.

The province says it will issue $90 million in patacons this week and as =
much as five times that amount by the end of the year. "Putting such a =
large number of patacons on the market can't help but have the =
psychological effect of devaluing the peso," says economist Jose =
Sbattella.

The patacon also raises questions about Argentina's commitment to the =
steep budget cuts promised in its recently announced "zero deficit" =
plan. The austerity push is one of Argentina's justifications for =
seeking billions of dollars in additional assistance from the IMF. Along =
with introducing the provincial bond, Gov. Ruckauf announced spending =
reductions of $500 million, slashing everything from cellphone use to =
the paychecks of senior administrators.

But for every patacon the province issues, that is one less peso saved =
from spending cuts, since patacons represent peso obligations that the =
government eventually must meet. Critics say Gov. Ruckauf hasn't gone =
far enough in rooting out waste and corruption. State Congressman =
Horacio Piemont uncovered one Buenos Aires Education Ministry official =
who is earning $2,000 a month while spending much of her time in another =
state campaigning for public office. Moreover, in Buenos Aires province, =
as in both federal and state bureaucracies throughout Argentina, =
government salaries have generally been higher than private-sector ones.

Argentina's 23 provinces are a financial mess -- one state had to put =
its capitol building on the block, while another tried taxing wind as an =
economic resource. But Buenos Aires is the worst case. Gov. Ruckauf, who =
took office in 1999, says the problem was one he inherited. Argentina's =
peso, lashed to an ever stronger dollar, has become a hindrance to =
exporters. Also, Mr. Ruckauf's predecessor left him big deficits, which =
the province funded until recently by borrowing. Since the late 1990s, =
the total debt of the province has doubled to nearly $6 billion.

The peso problem worsened this year -- especially after a tumultuous =
period in March when Argentina had three different economy ministers in =
three weeks. The province couldn't borrow. The equally strapped federal =
government delayed revenue transfers.

Buenos Aires health clinics have been running short of rubber gloves and =
syringes lately. Some primary schools have had to stop offering the only =
hot meal many low-income students were receiving. Last month, Gov. =
Ruckauf had to admit the truth: "There isn't cash to pay salaries," he =
said.

The province tried to put the best face on the patacon, even cranking up =
a promotional campaign. The slogan: "He who wants to, spends it. He who =
saves it, earns."

Late last week, the government filled automatic tellers with patacons so =
that Buenos Aires employees could collect part of their salary in the =
bonds. But at the last minute, provincial judges barred the release of =
the bonds until Gov. Ruckauf assumed personal liability for any =
financial harm the patacons might cause. Mr. Ruckauf said he will go =
ahead with the patacon launch Tuesday anyway.

Some Buenos Aires residents are receptive to the patacon, if only out of =
desperation. Almost everyone in the province seems to be in hock these =
days. The province owes $180 million to contractors. The state has its =
creditors, too. The print shop that did the patacon engravings took on =
the job to cover an $8 million bill for back taxes.

The government said it would establish a hotline where consumers can =
denounce speculation by merchants who won't accept the patacon at 1-to-1 =
to the peso. But people such as teachers union leader Susana Luburu, one =
of 180,000 workers and retirees who will be paid partly in patacons and =
partly in pesos, frets that the paper won't hold its value. "One peso =
buys a cup of coffee or a newspaper," she says. "But what will you be =
able to buy with one patacon?"

The situation is even more confusing for government contractors. The =
province wants to pay them in both patacons and yet another piece of =
paper -- three-year "debt consolidation" bonds that yield 12%. Daniel =
Amato, head of the contractors' federation, says he fears the value of =
the consolidation bonds will quickly collapse as their cash-starved =
bearers unload them. "Contractors don't need money in three years -- =
they need it this instant," says Mr. Amato.

Other solutions are under discussion in Buenos Aires. One La Plata =
newspaper has been conducting an online survey on whether Argentina =
should extend its peso-dollar peg the next logical step: doing away with =
the peso and using the greenback for all transactions. The thinking is =
that dollarization would once and for all eliminate investor fears of an =
imminent devaluation, thus reducing capital flight and bringing down =
interest rates.

Some provincial-rights diehards have floated an even more radical idea. =
Since the provincial bank, Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, was =
chartered in 1822, before Argentina's Central Bank came into being, it =
might not be subordinate to the Argentine equivalent of the Fed, the =
theory goes. Thus the province might legally be able to print its own =
pesos.

eventually must meet. Critics say Gov. Ruckauf hasn't gone far enough in =
rooting=20
out waste and corruption. State Congressman Horacio Piemont uncovered =
one Buenos=20
Aires Education Ministry official who is earning $2,000 a month while =
spending=20
much of her time in another state campaigning for public office. =
Moreover, in=20
Buenos Aires province, as in both federal and state bureaucracies =
throughout=20
Argentina, government salaries have generally been higher than =
private-sector=20
ones.</P>
<P>Argentina's 23 provinces are a financial mess -- one state had to put =
its=20
capitol building on the block, while another tried taxing wind as an =
economic=20
resource. But Buenos Aires is the worst case. Gov. Ruckauf, who took =
office in=20
1999, says the problem was one he inherited. Argentina's peso, lashed to =
an ever=20
stronger dollar, has become a hindrance to exporters. Also, Mr. =
Ruckauf's=20
predecessor left him big deficits, which the province funded until =
recently by=20
borrowing. Since the late 1990s, the total debt of the province has =
doubled to=20
nearly $6 billion.</P>
<P>The peso problem worsened this year -- especially after a tumultuous =
period=20
in March when Argentina had three different economy ministers in three =
weeks.=20
The province couldn't borrow. The equally strapped federal government =
delayed=20
revenue transfers.</P>
<P>Buenos Aires health clinics have been running short of rubber gloves =
and=20
syringes lately. Some primary schools have had to stop offering the only =
hot=20
meal many low-income students were receiving. Last month, Gov. Ruckauf =
had to=20
admit the truth: "There isn't cash to pay salaries," he said.</P>
<P>The province tried to put the best face on the patacon, even cranking =
up a=20
promotional campaign. The slogan: "He who wants to, spends it. He who =
saves it,=20
earns."</P>
<P>Late last week, the government filled automatic tellers with patacons =
so that=20
Buenos Aires employees could collect part of their salary in the bonds. =
But at=20
the last minute, provincial judges barred the release of the bonds until =
Gov.=20
Ruckauf assumed personal liability for any financial harm the patacons =
might=20
cause. Mr. Ruckauf said he will go ahead with the patacon launch Tuesday =

anyway.</P>
<P>Some Buenos Aires residents are receptive to the patacon, if only out =
of=20
desperation. Almost everyone in the province seems to be in hock these =
days. The=20
province owes $180 million to contractors. The state has its creditors, =
too. The=20
print shop that did the patacon engravings took on the job to cover an =
$8=20
million bill for back taxes.</P>
<P>The government said it would establish a hotline where consumers can =
denounce=20
speculation by merchants who won't accept the patacon at 1-to-1 to the =
peso. But=20
people such as teachers union leader Susana Luburu, one of 180,000 =
workers and=20
retirees who will be paid partly in patacons and partly in pesos, frets =
that the=20
paper won't hold its value. "One peso buys a cup of coffee or a =
newspaper," she=20
says. "But what will you be able to buy with one patacon?"</P>
<P>The situation is even more confusing for government contractors. The =
province=20
wants to pay them in both patacons and yet another piece of paper -- =
three-year=20
"debt consolidation" bonds that yield 12%. Daniel Amato, head of the=20
contractors' federation, says he fears the value of the consolidation =
bonds will=20
quickly collapse as their cash-starved bearers unload them. "Contractors =
don't=20
need money in three years -- they need it this instant," says Mr. =
Amato.</P>
<P>Other solutions are under discussion in Buenos Aires. One La Plata =
newspaper=20
has been conducting an online survey on whether Argentina should extend =
its=20
peso-dollar peg the next logical step: doing away with the peso and =
using the=20
greenback for all transactions. The thinking is that dollarization would =
once=20
and for all eliminate investor fears of an imminent devaluation, thus =
reducing=20
capital flight and bringing down interest rates.</P>
<P>Some provincial-rights diehards have floated an even more radical =
idea. Since=20
the provincial bank, Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, was =
chartered in=20
1822, before Argentina's Central Bank came into being, it might not be=20
subordinate to the Argentine equivalent of the Fed, the theory goes. =
Thus the=20
province might legally be able to print its own pesos.</P>
