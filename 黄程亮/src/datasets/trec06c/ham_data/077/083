Hello All,
I recently posted a question about using lesson study in preservice 
teacher education. This message is a follow up to the entire list 
about exactly how lesson study is being implemented in preservice 
teacher courses. I will briefly describe what I am doing below and 
would be interested in hearing what you are doing as well.

In our secondary math methods, each of our students teaches two mini 
lessons to their peers. The topics ranged from fractions and integers 
in grade 7 to functions in Algebra 2. We basically teach our way 
through the curriculum. In the first half of the semester, the 
students prepare their first lesson on their own. At mid semester, I 
teach them about lesson study. In the second half of the semester, 
lesson study groups of 3 or 4 students and each group prepares 3 or 4 
lessons as a group. For each lesson, they meet at least twice and a 
different member of the group teaches each lesson. Although this is 
not real "lesson study", it does get them talking to each other about 
mathematics and anticipating student responses.

This fall we will do lesson study more similar to what the Japanese 
do. I will teach the class about lesson study and put them in groups 
of 4 part way through the semester. They will meet with a public 
school teacher and select a topic that the public school teacher will 
be teaching at the beginning of December. The lesson study groups 
will then prepare for two or three weeks before teaching their lesson 
to their peers. Based on the feedback received after this teaching 
session, they will revise their lesson in preparation for teaching in 
the public schools at the beginning of December. As one of the final 
papers for the class they will write about their experience.


Thanks for reading. I look forward to hearing about your experiences 
with lesson  study for preservice teachers.


Blake
