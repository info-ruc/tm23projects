Hello all,
I am curious if anyone on the listserve is doing or is aware of any 
work on Lesson Study with preservice secondary teachers. Lesson study 
appears to be a good way to teach preservice teachers how to 
collaborate with a strong focus on student understanding and 
mathematics. Even if new teachers don't end up teaching in a school 
with a lesson study environment, they can at least communicate better 
with their peers about mathematics lessons as a result of having 
participated in some form of lesson study group.

Thanks to whomever may have information along these lines.

Blake
