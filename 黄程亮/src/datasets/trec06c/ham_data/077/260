Barb,

I spoke with Rick last night on this subject and with Dan Wilson earlier this week.  We all are confused on what exactly is expected of us - we don't know what the next steps are to be.  After the original resiliency workshop, which we all attended, we were left with the question of how this was to be implemented.  I think we need another presentation of some kind to get us up to speed on what the next steps for this project are to be and what our contribution to the project is besides financial.  If that would be possible, it would be greatly appreciated.  

Our provider cooperative has been intense on establishing a task list of items to complete within the next 6 months.  We have been very detailed with evaluating all of the projects to see they fit with our mission and our communities we serve.  If additional information and understanding could be given to us soon, we can implement in our planning discussions the early part of November.  If you have questions, please contact me.  Thank you.

Heather

Subject: next steps for resiliency
 
Resiliency partners:
I reported on projects of the partnership at the recent Cluster 5 advisory
committee meeting - several asked for more information on the project.  This
is a topic that catches people's attention.  I've asked a couple folks who
have expressed interest for suggestions about the companion day workshops.  
 
Since we're getting closer to possible kick-off dates, I'm wondering how the
decision making in the North Region Health Care Alliance and the NW
Minnesota Health Care Purchasing Alliance are coming along.  
 
I'd be happy to arrange a teleconference to give us the opportunity to catch
up on the decision making.  Which date works the best for you folks?
