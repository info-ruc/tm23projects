re how I am (attempting to) do lesson study in the highschool.

I'm teaching a course for the Board of Education called Increasing 
Students' Literacy Abilities in the High School Science Classroom.  
In this class which meets for 12 weeks, we will learn about 6 
literacy strategies and as we learn create lessons to implement 
them (partly for practice partly to evaluate how relevant these 
strategies are for science teaching).  Once we've got a sense of 
the ways we can bring literacy into the science classroom, we will 
develop one lesson plan whose goal is to increase students' 
literacy abilities.  this will be the focus of the second half of the 
course.  Someone will then teach the class while the rest of us 
watch and then we will evaluate and revise the plan on our last day 
of class.  

It's too short a time and the teachers will be coming from different 
schools but I didn't know how else to begin the process.  I don't 
work in one school but am the literacy person for several schools 
who work with the Gateway institute which is who I work for.  I 
needed to do literacy staff development with all the teachers but 
our focus is science and so I begin with the science teachers.

If anyone has any advice or thoughts about this, I'd love to hear it.
