Dear Lesson Study Community,

This is a reminder that the purpose of this listserv is to exchange 
information and ideas about lesson study.  Although this listserv is 
currently set so that replies to a message automatically go to the 
sender only, we have received a number of e-mails from individuals who 
would like to read and participate in subsequent responses.  
Therefore, you may want to consider copying the lesson study listserv 
(lessonstudy@listserv.tc.columbia.edu) when posting messages that 
contain information that might be useful or of interest to others.  
However, if your response to a message is relevant only to its sender, 
please respond only to that person.  As a member of this list, you 
must be the judge of what might be useful to share with the other 
subscribers, and what is more appropriate for private conversations. 

Thank You,
Lesson Study Research Group
