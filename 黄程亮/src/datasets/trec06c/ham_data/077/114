Hi, I put up a web page at
http://davis.wpi.edu/dsrg/Ace-XQ2002/index.html with "Additional
Resources":

It includes links (also downloadable .ps, .ppt files) to many resources
which may help you to further understand XQuery, the static type checking
system, the semantic caching papers to read (in relational context though)
and the original system design for the previous version, etc.

It is hard to absorb them at once, but you can aim to understand it as
much as possible and get back to me with questions...
