Hello,

We recently made major changes to our lesson study website, 
www.tc.columbia.edu/lessonstudy.  For those of you who have not 
recently visited this website, it now includes many additional and 
updated resources for those individuals who are interested in learning 
more about lesson study or implementing it in their schools.  We hope 
that this website will be a useful resource for the Lesson Study 
Community; please feel free to e-mail us (lsrg@columbia.edu) if you 
would like to share any feedback that can help us better serve your 
needs.  

Thank You,

Lesson Study Research Group
