I noticed that you were very interested in taoist discussion while
surfing the usenet news.  Are you very knowledgeable about this subject?
I am seeking someone to give input to those at Daoism Depot
(the largest taoist site on the internet with the most active
message board).  Would be great if you gave your input to those
who are regulars there.

The url... XXXX://www.edepot.com/taoism.html

click on the discussion forum link.  hope this message does not
go to waste.
