Dear Math230H Students:

Today's terrible events have filled us all with disgust.  I am shocked and 
sickened by the wickedness that has been directed towards this country in 
which I have made my home.

In his address to the nation tonight, President Bush stated that the federal 
government and the country 'will be open for business' tomorrow.  In the same 
spirit, Graham Spanier has directed that Penn State classes should meet at 
their appointed times.  I am therefore writing to tell you that we will meet 
tomorrow at the appointed time and we will carry on with our business, which 
is learning calculus.  I am however canceling the test scheduled for Thursday, 
as that sort of pressure is not appropriate at this time.  I will let you know 
later what kind of arrangements I will be making to compensate for the missed 
test.

If you want to donate blood, which is urgently needed, you may do so at the 
following locations and times:

Penn State University Park Campus
       Wagner Building from 10am-4pm on Wednesday
       White Building from 10am-4pm on Thursday
       HUB 10am-4pm Monday (9/17) & Wednesday (9/19)

If any of you should be missing a loved one in this tragedy, please accept my 
deepest sympathy.

Yours very sincerely

John Roe
