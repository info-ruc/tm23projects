Hi Jim,

    It isn't quite a white paper, but below is a link to the proposal.
This has the
basic node (SGI dual P3) and interconnect (myrinet and gigE) configuration
and
talks about the topology a bit. These clusters are pretty standard
anymore.

http://www.as.ysu.edu/~mcrescim/advancedcomputationWG/proposalosc.html

    The proposal talks about configuration I and II; what we have chosen
to do is
to implement both I and II together in the same cluster. I'd be happy to
tell you
and your CTPO what we know about the configuration now, though in a month
or two
(after it is installed an running!) we'll have better information.

    At any rate we really look forward to conversations with you and your
CTO
on what YSU's cluster supercomputer can do for the YBI. I will get  back
to
you with the name of our delegate to the Phreak by Monday. Be so good as
to
save a spot for us, and sorry for getting back to you so late!


Thanks,

michael
