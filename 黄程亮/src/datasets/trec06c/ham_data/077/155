A Los Angeles Commuter Group Sees Discrimination in Transit Policies

      A Los Angeles Commuter Group Sees Discrimination in Transit =
Policies
      By JAMES STERNGOLD
      OS ANGELES, Sept. 15 =97 Perhaps it is not surprising =97 in a =
county with bus lines that meander for up to 50 miles =97 that a =
landmark, five- year-old court decision ordering better bus service is =
still, like a runaway train, rolling along under appeal.

      The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the bus =
and rail systems here, has contested a series of decisions in federal =
court, and each time it has lost. Two weeks ago a federal appeals court =
served up yet another defeat, upholding an order that the authority =
promptly buy 248 new buses to reduce crowding. Last week the authority =
said it would appeal that order, arguing that the court is overstepping =
its bounds.

      The transit authority's campaign would wear down even the most =
tenacious litigator, but in this case Goliath faces a David-like foe who =
was frustrated but, once again, ready. The Bus Riders Union, a =
grass-roots organization that has pursued the case on a shoestring, =
prepared to take on its giant nemesis, and to win.

      "We had a momentary celebration, because we knew what was coming," =
said Eric Mann, who is co- chairman of the planning committee of the Bus =
Riders Union. "When the M.T.A. said they were appealing again, we were =
prepared. Eventually it has to end."=20

      Michelle Caldwell, a deputy executive director at the M.T.A., as =
the transit agency is known, expressed begrudging respect for the group =
and its zeal for a civil rights crusade.

      "It just reminds me of the 60's," Ms. Caldwell said. "I don't know =
how else to put it."

      But, Ms. Caldwell added, "They have been very effective."

      The battle began more than a decade ago when the M.T.A., the =
nation's third largest public transit system, behind New York and =
Chicago, developed a plan to build a huge subway and light-rail system. =
The idea was to woo commuters out of their cars with efficient trains =
and rescue the region from choking sprawl.

      But the expense was so enormous =97 one stretch of subway leading =
downtown cost nearly $500 million a mile =97 that the plan included =
cutsdowntown cost nearly $500 million a mile =97 that the plan included =
cuts in some bus service.

      Initially, the agency envisioned a 30-year, $183 billion =
construction program, before scaling back to a $75 billion, 20-year plan =
with 95 miles of rail. Most of the rail lines were intended to link =
middle-class and affluent suburbs to downtown Los Angeles.

      But it was not just the cost that galvanized the opposition (the =
rail construction program has been reduced even further since then). =
Neither was it the question of whether a rail system could work in such =
a spread-out metropolitan region. Instead, the critical issue was a plan =
to raise bus fares sharply and eliminate the sale of monthly bus passes, =
used heavily by workers, immigrants and members of minorities.

      Mr. Mann, who is also a leader of a workers advocacy group called =
the Labor Community Strategy Center, said he went to some public =
hearings to oppose the fare increases because of the impact on the =
working poor. Being rejected by the M.T.A.'s board, he said, transformed =
a modest interest into a cause. The Bus Riders Union was born.

      "This was as close to class and racial cruelty as I've ever seen," =
Mr. Mann said.

      The M.T.A.'s policies had a big effect, causing boardings on buses =
to drop to roughly 340 million a year now from 497 million in 1985. The =
system has 185 bus routes and nearly 2,000 buses that prowl a region =
that covers 1,433 square miles.

      The Bus Riders Union needed legal help, and it eventually found it =
in the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., a civil rights =
organization.

      Lawyers with the fund decided to employ a novel legal theory: that =
by degrading bus service, which is used heavily by members of minorities =
and the poor, in favor of rail transit that would have been used by =
people from the suburbs, the transit agency was engaging in de facto =
racial discrimination. Because the transit system relies heavily on =
federal financing, it opened the M.T.A. to a suit in federal court.

      The fund sued under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, a statute =
that had been employed largely in cases involving public education and =
other public facilities in the South.

      "This was the Mississippi model applied to Los Angeles," Mr. Mann =
said.

      The lawyers for the NAACP Fund found that more than 80 percent of =
bus riders were minority members and that their average income was =
extremely low. While the fund's lawyers prepared the legal briefs, the =
Bus Riders Union collected a huge amount of data on ridership to =
substantiate discrimination claims.

      "They are one of those clients, well, I don't know how to say =
this, but they're a real grass-roots organization and real close to the =
streets out there," said Erica Teasley, a lawyer for the fund.

      The M.T.A. was finally pushed into signing a consent decree in =
1996 in which it agreed to reduce overcrowding on the battered bus =
system and improve service, but that began a new series of battles. A =
federal judge, a special monitor appointed to oversee compliance, and =
now an appeals court have all found that the agency was not living up to =
the terms of the decree by not buying enough buses to reduce =
overcrowding.

      Among other things, the M.T.A. was also ordered to pay the legal =
costs of the Bus Riders Union, which have run into millions of dollars.

      The M.T.A. has argued that the courts are misreading the decree.

      "He's not a busing planner," Ms. Caldwell said of the federal =
judge, Terry J. Hatter Jr. "That's not his area of skill." She added, =
"The point is we can show you we have increased the buses in service as =
we were required."

      Ms. Caldwell said that, in hindsight, the agency should not have =
signed the decree, in large part because, in her view, the Bus Riders =
Union would never stop fighting over it.

      Ms. Teasley, the lawyer for the fund, said, "The way I see it, =
there's this big organization, the M.T.A., that's fighting poor people. =
They signed the decree, it was the right thing to do, and now, six years =
later, they're saying it was wrong. This is a waste of taxpayers' =
money."=20

      Mr. Mann acknowledged that his membership, of which about 200 are =
active, has become worn down and discouraged.

      "I just tell them, we keep winning, don't let yourself get too =
high or too low," Mr. Mann said. "But I think it's an optimistic story. =
If you see this as a story about democratic theory and not just buses, =
we're keeping thousands of people who have no voice in the ballgame, and =
we're winning."=20
