Michael

We have been watching  all of the announcements concerning this initiative with
a great deal of excitement and anticipation. Once the cluster goes live, we
would like to sit done with you to discuss it and to learn more about your
working group.

As for GeekPhreak, we love to have you come. Just e-mail the names of those
attending and I will make a reservation for them.
