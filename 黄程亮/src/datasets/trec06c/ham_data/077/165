Associativity-based Routing for Ad-Hoc Mobile Networks
 
This paper by C K Toh proposes an algorithm for another property desired
of routing algorithms in ad hoc networks: route stability.  The
algorithm uses a measure of associativity ticks to determine the
stability of a link.  The network is assumed to be more or less stable,
more like an office environment.  Route decisions are made at the
destination: the most stable route is chosen.
The main contribution of this paper is the idea of associativity ticks
for stability of routes.  In fact in a subsequent paper, this idea is
stretched further to mark nbrs in degrees of stability based on the
number of associativity ticks received.  This parameter of the 'degree
of route stability' required is then specified by the source of the
route.  Based on this parameter the route discovery and maintenance
takes place.  Overall this is an interesting idea where the QoS features
of routes are specified.  ABR seems to be the only routing protocol that
has included a measure of link load among the factors for choosing a
route.
ABR is a great protocol, but at the expense of more communication.
Associativity ticks are extra beacons that waste battery power.
Although a study by C K Toh reveals that beaconing does not affect
battery life significantly, I still think that messages should be sent
only when absolutely necessary.  Besides, ABR works fine for more stable
networks.  It would not work as desired when there is more mobility in
the network.
