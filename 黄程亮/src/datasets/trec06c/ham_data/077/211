Associativity-Based Routing Protocol for Ad-Hoc Mobile Networks

This paper presents a routing algorithm in which the selection of a
suitable routh is based on the stability, or the associativity, of a route
with respect to the nodes that comprise of the route. Unlikse many other
routing algorithms for ad-hoc networks, this approach gives the
destination node the authority to choose a suitable route for data
transmission. In such a scenario, several routes may be available, some
more stable (i.e., a higher degree of associativity) than the others The
routing algorithm, executed at the destination node, will then choose the
route with the best associativity. If more than one route has the same
computed degree of associativity, the one that presents the minimal number
of hops to the destination is chosen. It is clear that the ABR algorithm
favors longevity of the route at the expense of added route acquisition
overhead. 

	The proposed associativity-based routing algorithm seems suitable
for an ad hoc network that does not experience drastic topological
changes. Indeed, this design philosophy is based on the author's belief
that "in an ad-hoc mobile network, fast adaptability at the expense of
excessive radio bandwidth consumption is undesirable." This may also
justify the author's choice of a conference-room size environment for his
simulations.

	ABR has a mechanism that is invoked when a link of the chosen
route is severed. The Localized Query (LQ) is enabled to seek out an
alternative partial route by the downstream pivoting node. This operation
is possible because of the degree of associativity that is inherent in the
chosen route. However, an issue that needs to be addressed here is a
trade-off between the time-out period after which the pivoting node gives
up searching for alternative partial node and the database of the upstream
node of the broken link to queue the incoming packets from the source. One
possible solution is to have the upstream node send a signal back to the
source, temporarily halting the flow of the data packets until a certain
amount of time has passed, after which the route is either re-established
or a new route needs to be acquired.

	One disadvantage of the ABR is its excessive use of the bandwidth
in a BW-limited ad-hoc mobile environment. On the other hand, ABR may be a
good candidate when we bring QoS into ad-hoc networks. Because it
introduces a sense of stability in choosing a route, that may be desirable
for many multimedia-intensive applications. However, in that regard, the
classical question remains: how to effectively trade off between time
delay, bandwidth utilization, and the guaranteed QoS level.
