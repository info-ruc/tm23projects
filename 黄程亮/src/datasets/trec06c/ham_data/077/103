      What We Work for Now
      By JEROME M. SEGAL
      OLLEGE PARK, Md. -- Despite all our concerns with =
self-fulfillment, most Americans work to earn money, just as their =
forebears did 100 years ago. The relative costs of necessities have =
changed, and so has a fair definition of what is necessary. But even =
with all our economic growth, and even with some items much cheaper than =
they once were, families still spend about four-fifths of their budgets =
for core needs, just as their counterparts did a century ago. Perhaps =
there should be some national introspection about how much we have =
really gained.

      Certainly, we have escaped the overwhelming tyranny of food. In =
1901, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that in major industrial =
cities, the biggest expenditure item for families was food =97 half of =
spending in low-income families and a third in more affluent ones. In =
1999, food took only 15 percent of household spending, and more than a =
third of that spending was for food prepared away from home. For food =
from their own kitchens, Americans now use up only 9 percent of their =
budgets. They can cover that with a little more than a month of work =97 =
probably the lowest level of work effort for food in human history. Even =
households in the lowest fifth of income use only 18 percent of total =
spending for food.

      Something similar has happened with clothing. In 1901 it took 10 =
to 15 percent of the family budget, and now it takes only 5 percent.

      What, then, are Americans spending their money on? A common =
stereotype of the pampered consumer might suggest that large amounts are =
going for toys and luxuries, but I found while conducting studies for =
Redefining Progress, a public policy organization in Oakland, Calif., =
that this is a misconception. Electronic gadgets, for instance, have a =
small place in consumer spending =97 2 percent in 2000. Entertainment =
takes less than 6 percent.

      The largest expenditure item now is housing. Bringing together =
renters and owners, shelter, including utilities, takes 27 percent of =
our spending, compared to a very similar 25 percent in 1901. Although =
our homes today are much more luxurious, safe neighborhoods with good =
public schools remain out of reach for many.

      The big growth category is transportation. In the earliest studies =
of consumption, transportation wasn't even a separate category; it took =
only 1 or 2 percent of spending. But then came the automobile, and now =
we devote more than 20 percent of our spending to transportation. Just =
to cover that, the average American family works from New Year's Day to =
March 14. No society in history has worked so much just to be able to =
get around.

      A car may once have been a luxury, but as cities and suburbs have =
spread out, stores have disappeared from neighborhoods, and work and =
school have ceased to be within walking distance, nearly all Americans =
have become car-dependent. And with most women in the formal work force, =
many families have two automobiles =97 not really as a matter of choice, =
but as a basic need.

      Another work-related item virtually unknown a century ago is day =
care. Self-sufficiency budgets, calculated by many states to determine =
families' costs for basic needs, allocate 25 to 30 percent of a =
low-income household's spending for day care.

      Though education remains only a minor category of spending =97 2 =
percent =97 this is just on average. For families with children in =
college =97 and college is now required for far more jobs than in the =
past =97 this expense can be staggering.

      So in a century of growing incomes and changing lives, what has =
been gained? While the energies of Americans are expended to obtain =
different items than they were years ago, what remains constant is the =
emphasis on the basics.

      In 1901, 80 percent of spending went for food, housing and =
clothing. In 1999, 81 percent of spending went for food, housing, =
clothing, transportation and health care. A century of economic growth =
has certainly brought some genuine progress, but it is less clear-cut =
than we sometimes think.
