Barbara,
I have the lesson study videos that are listed on the Japanese Lesson Study Home page:
http://lessonresearch.net/
I am planning on using the Perspectives Video when I introduce lesson study to the
elementary teachers in my district.  I think this one may work well for you too.

There are also links to resource articles.

Teachers College at Columbia has a lesson study page too.
http://www.tc.columbia.edu/centers/lessonstudy/Lesson_Study.htm

Does anybody know about any other videos and good web sites for lesson study?

I hope this helps.
Monica Hartman
