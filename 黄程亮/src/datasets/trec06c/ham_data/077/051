Jane,

When we were looking at doing lesson study with the support of a grant, I
showed a video on it. Seeing the process helped clarify what it is.
Teachers commented "Oh we can do that.  If there were a school near us
that did it, I would have suggested visiting.  Maybe someday lesson study
will be a norm in schools.
