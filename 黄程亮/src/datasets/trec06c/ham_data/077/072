Jane, please share information about how you are implementing lesson study in 
high school.  That is one of our goals, and I would love to be able to cite 
your examples when I speak to high school teachers and principals.  Thanks!

From: "Jane Gorman" <JGorman@edc.org>, on 8/20/01 7:47 AM:


My colleagues and I at Education Development Center in Newton,
Massachusetts are working on a proposal that would bring lesson study to
high school mathematics teachers in the Boston area.  We have for the past
year been working with one group in Watertown, Mass and have a two more
groups starting up this fall.

At the present time, I don't know of very many high school settings where
there is lesson study work going on, but would like to be in touch with
anyone who is doing this work.  If you have a high school lesson study
group going or are doing research in this area, please contact me.

Thanks very much.
