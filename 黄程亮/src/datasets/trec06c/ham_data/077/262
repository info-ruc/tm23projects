Linda:  If you have people interested in a conference call sooner, let's go
with it sooner.  There is some additional dynamic going on with the NRHA
that on the one hand can hold us up, or on the other hand can be managed if
we move ahead.  My two cents is that we move ahead, with the goal of keeping
all partners informed and invited, recognizing that we not have NRHA
support.  not sure.  ON the positive side, we are expanding interest from
new partners---------so let's go with the positive flow.  Looking forward to
the conference call.  
Scheduling the week of October 22 is fine too.  I'm open Tuesday, Wed
afternoon, Thursday and Friday.

Let's try for some new options.  Heather, maybe you could suggest some dates
that are convenient for you.

A conference call would be fine but as I sent in my previous e-mail -
neither of those three dates work for me.

Here is the plan that Kathy Marshall sent us early in Sept.  I think it
details the next steps, and reflects the planning discussion we had in
Duluth.  Linda has proposed dates for a conference call meeting to discuss,
and we know the Regional Partnership is ready to move ahead.  I apologize
for confusion.  The plan seems clear to me, so I need help understanding the
confusion.  Perhaps we could agree to the conference call, find a convenient
time, and see where it takes us.  Again, it would be wonderful to keep the
collaboration among our organizations going.  Thanks.

Barb,

I spoke with Rick last night on this subject and with Dan Wilson earlier
this week.  We all are confused on what exactly is expected of us - we don't
know what the next steps are to be.  After the original resiliency workshop,
which we all attended, we were left with the question of how this was to be
implemented.  I think we need another presentation of some kind to get us up
to speed on what the next steps for this project are to be and what our
contribution to the project is besides financial.  If that would be
possible, it would be greatly appreciated.  

Our provider cooperative has been intense on establishing a task list of
items to complete within the next 6 months.  We have been very detailed with
evaluating all of the projects to see they fit with our mission and our
communities we serve.  If additional information and understanding could be
given to us soon, we can implement in our planning discussions the early
part of November.  If you have questions, please contact me.  Thank you.

Heather

Heather and Rick:
Any feedback from the NRHA about interest in moving forward with this?
 
Linda:
All the times work for me.

Subject: next steps for resiliency
 
Resiliency partners:
I reported on projects of the partnership at the recent Cluster 5 advisory
committee meeting - several asked for more information on the project.  This
is a topic that catches people's attention.  I've asked a couple folks who
have expressed interest for suggestions about the companion day workshops.  
 
Since we're getting closer to possible kick-off dates, I'm wondering how the
decision making in the North Region Health Care Alliance and the NW
Minnesota Health Care Purchasing Alliance are coming along.  
 
I'd be happy to arrange a teleconference to give us the opportunity to catch
up on the decision making.  Which date works the best for you folks?
Thursday, Oct 4 at 2 pm
Monday, Oct 8 at 9 am
Friday, Oct 12 at 9 am
