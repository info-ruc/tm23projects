This paper introduces ABR, an on-demand routing protocol which uses the
stability of neighboring nodes to determine the best route.  The stability
is determined using "associativity ticks" -- a count of "alive" messages
from neighboring nodes greater than a set threshold (determined by the
migration speed and transmission distance of the nodes) sets those nodes
as active links, and not just a migratory node.  Thus, as in TORA, the
routes maintained may not be the shortest, but unlike TORA, multiple
routes are not maintained.

This paper was interesting in that a new metric was used to pick routes,
and they actually did an experiment (albeit very simple) to study mobility
traces of people occupied in real-world tasks.

However, I'm not sure how extensible this protocol is for different
varieties of mobile networks.  It seems that it's designed for networks
that have a few very stable nodes among more mobile nodes; thus the
associativity ticks will be able to identify these almost base-station
like nodes and route through them to reduce route rediscovery actions.
I'm not sure if it will perform as satisfactorily in an environment where
all the mobile nodes have high migratory patterns.
