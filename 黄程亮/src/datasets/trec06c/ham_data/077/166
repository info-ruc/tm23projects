>Associativity Based Routing For Ad Hoc Mobile Networks.
>
>       This paper presents an on-demand routing protocol for mobile ad
>hoc networks.  The two main contributions of this paper include a method
>(for the first time) to estimate the stability of a node and to detect
>nodes moving in the present vicinity, and to use the stability and other
>link metrics such as link capacity etc. to choose the routes.  The
>stability of the nodes is detected by periodic messages called
>associativity ticks. 
>
>       The author of this paper claim based on an experiment that in
>typical applications of ad hoc network, the nodes are mobile for short
>periods of time but remaim stationary for long periods of time between
>motion.  This corresponds to the random waypoint mobility model used in
>simulations.   While this may not represent the mobility patterns for
>all aplications, giving priority to stable nodes would work quite well
>under this assumption.  The route discovery phase of this protocol is
>similar to AODV involving broadcast queries (BQ) and replies.  Since the
>protocol aims to select routes based on metrics other than distance
>additional information is appended to the BQ as it propagates.
>
>       Link breakages are detected wither by link level protocol or by
>passive acknowledgements.  Upon breakage of a routing link a local query
>is initiated by the upstream node to find alternate routes.  If a local
>query fails to generate a reply the upstream node is intimated at it
>starts the process all over again. Repeating partial recovery at each
>upstream node looks very redundant and involves high control overhead.
>Further, concurrent events could generate route loops.  The paper argues
>on a case by case basis that such a thing does not happen.  But in real
>systems, messages could get lost or delivered out of order and this may
>cause route loops.  I don;t believe that this protocol is loop free.
>
>       The simulations presented in the paper appear to be
>insufficicient.  Standard metrics such as packet delivery, goodput,
>latency etc... are not discussed. Results showing the effectiveness of
>BQ and LQ are hard to understand.  Further the simulator seems to
>neglect path propagation and congestion effects and assumes perfect
>medium.  In sum, stability should be considered to be an important
>metric while routing; this paper presents a way to detect stability.
>However, other routing protocols enhanced to use stability information
>might be more efficient that this.
