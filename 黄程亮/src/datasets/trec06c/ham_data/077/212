10) Associativity-Based Routing for Ad-Hoc Mobile Networks

In this paper, they author motivates that Ad-Hoc networks do not have
hosts which move about randomly, and presents the idea that hosts
undergo a period of stability between movements, and that said
stability tends to last for a decent period of time. From this idea,
they've created ABR (Associativity-Based Routing) which finds routing
paths are selected by their likelihood of being long-lived and
therefore more stable. By choosing paths that are unlikely to be
broken, ABR lowers the amount of communication bandwidth used to
repair routes that are broken by having less broken routes.

Routes are found on demand like algorithms such as DSR, but unlike DSR
all routes are computed from a source to a destination, and the
destination picks a single route which is most likely to be long-lived
based on the associtativity count of the hosts [A measure of how long
a link between nodes has been active.]  From there routes are repaired
at breakpoints via LQ local queries which attempt to repair the
route. If a repair is not possible at the breakpoint, the LQ's bubble
backwards towards the sender, trying to repair the route at each
step. For local problems in the network, this scheme repairs routes
cheaply, but it is easy to construct cases where this approach is very
resource inefficient.

They do an extensive performance evaluation using simulations to
demonstrate the effectiveness of ABR, but tend to overwhelm the
reader with details. It was difficult to pick out the important
numbers from the large volume of data in the 7 pages of results. A
more concise results section would have been more useful. 

I thought the insight of finding long lived routes not only made sense
but matches my ideas on how Ad-Hoc networks are used. Although there
are some subset of nodes that are constantly in motion, most nodes are
stable for some period of time, and those are the nodes that should be
chosen for routing paths, as they are likely to remain stable.
