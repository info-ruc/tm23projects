ABR (Associativity-Based Routing) is a simple straightforward on-demand 
protocol that attempts to make use of stability in ad hoc routing. ABR employs 
the unique concept of associativity to determine the amount of stability in 
routes. It is measured in terms of the number of ticks, or beacons, 
successfully exchanged between neighbors. The longer a pair of nodes are co-
reachable, the higher the number of ticks. If a node and its neighbor move out 
of each other’s reach, their common node ticks are reset indicating movement or 
instability.

ABR uses broadcast and point-to-point routing to reactively construct, and 
reconstruct routes. A source node initiates a broadcast query (BQ), which is 
propagated through all possible routes to the destination (DEST). DEST chooses 
a single route based on highest associativity (and shortest route if there is a 
tie), and forwards a REPLY along that route. Each node keeps track of its 
neighbors and hop counts to the source and destination. The Route Re-
construction (RRC) Phase is invoked when an existing route changes. Nodes that 
lose a link along a path become pivoting nodes. A downstream pivoting node will 
send Route Notifications (RN) downstream to remove invalid routes. An upstream 
pivoting node will initiate a Localized Query (LQ), by broadcasting messages, 
to try to partially rebuild the path from itself. It will only select a new 
route that is shorter or equal to the previous route. If no suitable partial 
path to DEST is found before an LQ_TIMEOUT, the path will backtrack upstream 
and repeat LQ until the pivoting node is ½ the number of hops of the original 
path. At that point, it will send RNs upstream to erase the entire route and 
the source starts a new BQ. This algorithm is particularly efficient in dense 
node populations, where partial routes are easier to find, and therefore 
reduces re-construction time and avoids the maintenance of multiple routes. It 
may not perform as well in sparse environments.

As an on-demand protocol, ABR requires nodes to maintain a moderate amount of 
information (single path to node without maintaining entire path in each node), 
and forwarding of routing packets is also moderate since periodic broadcasts 
are not required. Therefore, it is fair to say that ABR has the potential to 
perform well in large-scale networks, but this issue is not addressed in this 
paper. An interesting study would be to simulate ABR in high population 
networks. In addition, it is not clear how ABR will react when a network 
partition occurs.

ABR applies well to BS-oriented WLANs, as it can exploit the stability of 
existing base stations, and provide recovery from BS failure. The associativity 
measure may not be as successful in mobile ad hoc networks. The rule of 
associativity states that after instability, or node migration, a node will be 
stable for some time. In ABR, the application of this rule is modified, and is 
used such that the longer a node has been stable within a group of neighbors, 
the more likely it will continue to be stable. Therefore it is not a direct 
application of the rule, nor is it guaranteed to select the most stable routes, 
since a node that was moving could suddenly become stable, and vice versa. To 
improve selection of stable routes, ABR can consider node speed in addition to 
associativity states.
