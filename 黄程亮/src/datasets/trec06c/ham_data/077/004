I have the courage to become rich, do you?

This niifty little letter has the power to fire your boss, within weeks! Forget about all those silly other chain letters, they are old and they don't work!
This letter will work for you today and will work for you tomorrow, it is a virtual money machine-- and it is legal!  I have never had as much fun making money in my entire life. Will you join me?
Forget about all the fancy math equations-- this letter allows you to think about all of the possibilities yourself.

Here is how this letter works(pay attention!):
We are going to be selling 5 marketing reports to each other.  This is what makes this letter legal, we are selling a product for a profit.
We will be selling a total of 5 reports.  Your total investment is $25.00 -- the cost of going to McDonalds and the movies with your wife!  And this work is so easy that a child of ten could do it.

Step 1: Order all 5 reports, putting a $5 bill in each of the five envelopes.  You will need these reports to re-sell to others.
Step 2: Cut and paste this letter uinto notepad or another word document.
Step 3: Remove the last name (number5) and replace it with your name and address. Delete the 1st name on the list, and move everyone else up one slot.
             Don't cheat here, everyone is entitled to their turn, and if you cheat this letter will not
             work as planned.
Step 5: Mail this letter to at least 20 people. I promise you that this will multiply like a virus.
Step 6: Open your mailbox and take a trip to your bank, it's really fun!

If you see my name listed more than once, then this is the first generation of this letter, you my friend are on the ground floor!
