CERT Advisory CA-2001-24 Vulnerability in OpenView and NetView

   Original release date: August 15, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

   * Systems running HP OpenView Network Node Manager (NNM) Version 6.1
     on the following platforms:

     * HP9000 Servers running HP-UX releases 10.20 and 11.00 (only)
     * Sun Microsystems Solaris releases 2.x
     * Microsoft Windows NT4.x / Windows 2000

   * Systems running Tivoli NetView Versions 5.x and 6.x on the following
     platforms:

     * IBM AIX
     * Sun Microsystems Solaris
     * Compaq Tru64 Unix
     * Microsoft Windows NT4.x / Windows 2000

Overview

   ovactiond is a component of OpenView by Hewlett-Packard Company (HP)
   and NetView by Tivoli, an IBM Company (Tivoli). These products are
   used to manage large systems and networks. There is a serious
   vulnerability in ovactiond that allows intruders to execute arbitrary
   commands with elevated privileges. This may subsequently lead to an
   intruder gaining administrative control of a vulnerable machine.

I. Description

   ovactiond is the SNMP trap and event handler for both OpenView and
   NetView. There is a vulnerability in ovactiond that allows an intruder
   to execute arbitrary commands by sending a malicious message to the
   management server. These commands run with the privileges of the
   ovactiond process, which varies according to the operating system.

   OpenView version 6.1 is vulnerable in the default configuration.
   Versions prior to 6.1 are not vulnerable in the default configuration,
   but there are public reports that versions prior to 6.1 may be
   vulnerable if users have made customizations to the trapd.conf file.

   On June 21, 2001, HP released a security bulletin (HP SB #154) and a
   patch for this vulnerability in OpenView version 6.1. For more
   information, see

http://us-support.external.hp.com/cki/bin/doc.pl/screen=ckiDisplayDocument?docId=200000055277985
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/952171

   Tivoli NetView versions 5.x and 6.x are not vulnerable with the
   default configuration. It is, however, likely that customized
   configurations are vulnerable. This security vulnerability only exists
   if an authorized user configures additional event actions and
   specifies potentially destructive varbinds (those of type string or
   opaque). Tivoli has developed a patch for versions 5.x and 6.x. The
   patch addresses the vulnerability in ovactiond, as well as taking
   preventative measures on other components specific to NetView.

   Tivoli has published information on this vulnerability at

          http://www.tivoli.com/support/

II. Impact

   An intruder can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the
   ovactiond process. On UNIX systems, ovactiond typically runs as user
   bin; on Windows systems it typically runs in the Local System security
   context. On Windows NT systems, this allows an intruder to gain
   administrative control of the underlying operating system. On UNIX
   systems, an intruder may be able to leverage bin access to gain root
   access.

   Additionally, systems running these products often have trust
   relationships with other network devices. An intruder who compromises
   these systems may be able to leverage this trust to compromise other
   devices on the network or to make changes to the network
   configuration.

III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   We will update the appendix as we receive more information. If you do
   not see your vendor's name, the CERT/CC did not hear from that vendor.
   Please contact your vendor directly.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This appendix contains information provided by vendors for this
   advisory. When vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their
   comments.

Apple

   Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server do not have this vulnerability.

Computer Associates

   Computer Associates has completed a review of all Unicenter functions
   and processing related to SNMP traps as indicated by the advisory.
   Unicenter is not subject to the same vulnerabilities as demonstrated
   by the SNMP trap managers identified by CERT (i.e., OpenView and
   NetView). CA Unicenter does not formulate commands determined through
   trap data parsing. Unicenter implements this technology using
   different methods and thereby avoids this exposure. Computer
   Associates maintains strong relationships with these vendors and
   recommends that clients running any environments containing either of
   these products visit the website URLs specifically identified by the
   CERT Coordination Center.

FreeBSD

   FreeBSD does not use this code.

Fujitsu

   Regarding VU#952171, Fujitsu's UXP/V operating system is not affected
   because there's no implementation of any OpenView Technology in UXP/V.

Hewlett-Packard

   On June 21, 2001, HP released a security bulletin (HP SB #154) and a
   patch for this vulnerability in OpenView version 6.1. For more
   information, see

http://us-support.external.hp.com/cki/bin/doc.pl/screen=ckiDisplayDocument?docId=200000055277985
http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/952171

Microsoft

   NNM is a third-party application as far as our platform is concerned.
   We don't have any special relationship with it. HP would need to
   provide the patches.

Tivoli

   Tivoli acknowledges that certain user customizations to Tivoli NetView
   may lead to a potential security exposure. Please reference
   http://www.tivoli.com/support/ for further information and to obtain
   an e-fix which addresses the issue.
