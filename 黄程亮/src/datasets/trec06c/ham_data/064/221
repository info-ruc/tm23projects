   How are you selecting the emulated driver?  Are you doing that in TimeDX?

   No, that all looks fine.  What the emulated drivers do is take the 
standard windows calls that have been around for quite some time and work 
quite well and wrap them up as if they were DirectX calls.  The trouble is 
that those calls can have huge latencies in them, for instance the 
DirectSound emulated drivers typically add 200-300ms of latency.  If you 
intend to keep on using them (and you may have no alternative) you will 
want to bench them with some auto calibrating itemfile, connect the output 
of the sound card to the line input (you probably will have to change the 
record device in the mixer and the DMDX VOX sensitivity), build a wave file 
with 1 second of silence followed by a beep and use items like this:

+1 "calibrate" / * <wav> "1secthenbeep" /;

   Having just benched the testbed I find little or no difference between 
the emulated and non emulated drivers (really suspicious in the light of 
earlier testing but the testbed is pretty buff these days and has a nice 
sound card in it so it's is possible), RTs in the above scenario are all 
1002 or 1003ms regardless of what I choose in TimeDX.

   Can't, drivers are hardware specific.
