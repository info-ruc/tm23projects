Subject: Ic 2.8 system requirements?

	Hi
		Im currently using IC 2.8 and was wondering what its minimum system 
requirements are?(ram, speed,processor,system etc.) By the way Im a mac user 
so Is there acopy out there for a 68k mac?
Thanx in advance and for quick responses?
-Alex

Ps- Reason is my mac is slowly dying , cant send it to get fixed because it 
would leave me with no computer to work on to get my trinity college fire 
fighteing entry ready, so Im looking for a extremmly cheap mac or pc 
portable (0-$420). and would be nice to know how low of a system I can go 
and have IC still work and be able to download.

Thanx again! = ^ )
