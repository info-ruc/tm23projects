The hardware is limited to 31.5' (~ 10 meters). The limitation is on the 
design of the receive amplifier's gain module (and noise floor). Generally 
scaling this to an integer of 32767 results in a precision of just over 1 
tenth of an inch (or 1/3 mm). Few robot projects can maneuver either 
themselves or an end effector to this tolerance. Thus the size of integers 
is usually not a limiting factor in using these devices.
