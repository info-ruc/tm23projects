Hi!  I've tried connecting the SSC II to the handyboard through a
telephone wire (and when that didn't work) through the configurating
header at the upper right corner of the SSC II circuit board.  I've
downloaded the proper library to the handyboard and I've run the commands.
The SSC II seems to accept the commands fine but the servo still isn't
working.  I'm really at a loss here can anyone help?
