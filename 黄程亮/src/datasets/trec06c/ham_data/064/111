I guess what I'm afraid of then is that subjects' responses may somehow be
slightly different following the slightly different display times.

Dear DMDXers,

I keep getting messages like 

"!  Display error at msec 20665, tick 2810 in item 30, frame "
                      #########             "
!    moved into video memory 19 ticks late
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)
!    -- possibly caused by another process taking 20 ticks.."

and I'm afraid this may affect subjects' reactions.

Any thoughts or ideas?

thanks,

Jerry P.
