My understanding is that these messages don't reflect inaccuracies in
response time measurement so much as inaccuracies in stimulus display
times. If there are any processes running at the same time as DMDX, this
kind of error is likely to be more frequent.



<excerpt><bigger>Dear DMDXers,


I keep getting messages like 


"!  Display error at msec 20665, tick 2810 in item 30, frame "           
                        #########             "

!    moved into video memory 19 ticks late

!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)

!    -- possibly caused by another process taking 20 ticks.."


and I'm afraid this may affect subjects' reactions.


Any thoughts or ideas?


thanks,


Jerry P.
