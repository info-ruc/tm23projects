That would depend on what was going on in the frame that was delayed and
the previous frame which would have been displayed for longer.

Judging by the error that was generated, the frame that was delayed was a
mask ("######"). If this was intended to mask a very brief display of a
word that was in the preceding frame (e.g. a sequence like "word 1" /
"######" / "word 2" /) this could cause changes in responses. "word 1"
would have been displayed for longer and may not have been masked as
effectively as would be expected. 

However, if it was a forward mask (e.g. a sequence of events like "######"
/ "word 1" / "word 2"/ ) then it is unlikely that responses would be
significantly altered. Although the onset of the mask might have been
delayed by a short while, this wouldn't alter the timing of events after
the mask. The slight delay before the start of the trial is unlikely to
distract subjects. You can check the data and find out. 

One tip that is often useful in preventing these late ticks is to increase
the delay parameter <d> in the top line. This is especially helpful if you
are displaying graphics files or using the record vocal setting.
