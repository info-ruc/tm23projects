Actually I am using the free version, but you have to be very careful,
if you need reliable floating point operations. For example try
printf("\n%f",4.1/4.1); and have a look at the surprising result (2.).
This is just an example, there loads of these errors!

I tried to figure out, if the commercial version still has these
problems,
but haven't got a response from newton labs yet.

Probably the problem can be solved, by rebuilding the Pcoder with a new
math library, but I haven't been able to do so yet.

Hope this helps.
