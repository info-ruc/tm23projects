   Or don't use it all unless you actually want it, it is only intended for 
use when DMDX has to be synchronized with other machines.  If you want the 
fastest display possible but that won't have display errors use zero or 
negative values, these will make DMDX schedule it as fast as possible, in 
the case of negative values (I have seen the occasional machine not handle 
D0 well) as fast as possible plus the negative value times -1).  For 
instance <d -10> should be as quick as possible and never give trouble.
