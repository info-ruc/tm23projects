This is really an empirical question, isn't it?  At least you know exactly
how many ticks late the stimulus was.  The number of ticks can be
translated easily into a msec value.

Also, consider the kind of processor, graphics card, system RAM, graphics
RAM, resolution, OS, Direct X version, and number of processes running.  If
your computer is on a network, don't let it share any resources.  Also,
make sure that there are no other programs loading on startup.

I run a 450 Mhz Pentium III with 256 MB RAM, dual video cards (can't
remember which ones I ended up with in there... but they each had at least
8 MB RAM). The thing rarely misses a tick.
