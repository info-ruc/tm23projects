Hi all,
    I was wondering if any battery expert can help me on this.  A friend of
mine gave me a NiMH battery pack for my HB expansion board AUX power supply.
It is rated 6V, 3 AH (yeah, he gave me the spec.) but there is no charger.
I know charging NiMH is complicated.  I was wondering if anyone knows a
ready-to-use charger circuit, or just the config of the charger, or some
info on how I should charge it.  Thanks!
    By the way, All Electronics (www.allelectronics.com) sells some cheap
Nickel-Cadmium packs.  Some of them are 6V at 600 mAH for about $5.00.
