   I am experiencing some anomalies in my deeper testing of the new (1.2.00 
and up) Digital Vox code when it is used without the RecordVocal device, 
you might want to exercise some caution here, looks like it's calculation 
of RT can be dramatically off (one of the major pains of looping capture 
buffers is determining just when it was that clock was turned on and it 
looks like there's a hole in the code).  The conditions under which this 
occurs have yet to be determined.
