Hi everybody, I have a software problem hope any expert can help me.. thanks..
I'm using IC ver. 3.2 for my project, when I run the main() program, it said I
have not enough stack space. One of my sub-function program also have the same
condition and I have solved it by using the "start_process" command, I just
want to know how can I use the "start_process" command for the main() program
?? or is there any other method which can increase the stack space directly
without start another process ?? thanks..
