Hi,
We saw this exact problem last year.  Our servos went so crazy that they
actually destroyed their gears and had to be scrapped.  The fix is simple,
solder a capacitor across the motor leads.  The motor causes noise on the
lines which the servo interprets as control signals.  We used a .1 microfarad
ceramic disk capacitor from Radio Shack and the problem went away instantly.
