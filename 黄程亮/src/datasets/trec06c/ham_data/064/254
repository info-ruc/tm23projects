  It is basically charged the same way and has all of the faults of he NiCd
(voltage depression, etc.) but while it has a higher average capacity, it does
not have as much current delivery (higher internal resistance.)  The cells peak
charge in a similar manner, but the delta drop-off when charged is less
obvious.  I don't know much about these cells beyond that.  I suppose I will
need to read up on them soon...

I recommend, again, a good peak charger for best battery health.  Two chargers
I know will deal with them, the Novak Millenium and (I think) the Tekin BC112.
Neither of these are cheap though (>$100).  Others may have lower cost ones,
but I don't know them.

have fun,
DLC
