I don't know of an automated way of doing this. You can use the <ln>
command to display multiple lines within an item, such as:

0 <ln 0> "Hello", <ln 2> "World";

which will display "Hello" in the centre of the screen and "World" 2 lines
underneath. Unfortunately, you then need to figure out how many words you
can fit on each line and format the text into lines. You could probably do
the formatting using text formulas like =LEN, =MID, etc in Excel if you
wanted to avoid counting characters by hand.

If what you want to do is display a single page of text (such as the
instructions for the experiment) an easy way to present a page of text is
to create a bitmap. If you set up a screen display of instructions in
Microsoft Word (or whatever), press the "print screen" button on your
keyboard, you can then paste the screen display in Paint or Photoshop and
make a bitmap file that contains the text that you want displayed. Then as
the first line of your file you can put in:

0 <bmp> "instructions" ;

(where "instructions.bmp" is the name of the file that contains the
instructions for your experiment). That way you can have perfectly fomatted
instructions as the first item of your file without too much hassle.

Good luck,

Matt

PS Thanks to Mike Ford for this idea.
