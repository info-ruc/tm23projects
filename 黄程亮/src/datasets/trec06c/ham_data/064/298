On Slashdot ( http://www.slashdot.org/ ) there is an article
http://slashdot.org/articles/00/03/30/1546247.shtml ) that talks about a
tilt sensor/accelereometer that was connected to a Palm Pilot for gaming
purposes. The ADXL202
http://products.analog.com/products/infoSamples.asp?product=ADXL202 ), from
Analog Devices, seems to be a perfect sensor for a Handy Board based robot.
I was wondering if anyone had used it? If so, would you share your diagrams
and drivers with the rest of us?
Tanks.
