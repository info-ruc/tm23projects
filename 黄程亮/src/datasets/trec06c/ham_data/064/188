Hi,
has anybody ever manage to rebuild a pcoder, using Kent Farnsworth's
routines? I just tried, but I am usure about the compiler switches.
Next to the startbutton I found the remark "rev. 1.2A", Kent just
mentioned REV2 or REV 2.1 board. Furthermore he talked about a
strip_cr.exe
utility, but I do not know, when to use it (before compiling, after
compiling,
before downloading ?!?). Even worse, Kent's email address is not working
any more.

Anyway, I tried different switches, the only success was a pcoder, which
chrashed after displaying the Version-Message.

As I stated a few times before in this newsgroup, the free pcoder 2.81
and also
Julian Skidmores replacement 2.82 do have floating point problems which
I want to
solve by rebuilding the pcoder with a new math library.

For this purpose I am just searching for the easiest way to do so, it
does not matter
if I have to do this with Windows / DOS or Linux. So if anybody has
experiences to
this matter, please help.

Any help is really appreciated!

Dirk
