   Actually it appears that the problem of RT 1 items was due to the user 
specifying the time limit in every single item.  When the time limit is 
specified it forces DMDX to re-setup all the DirectSoundCapture stuff, once 
he specified the timelimit once in the parameter line the problems went away.
