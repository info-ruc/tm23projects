Actually Jake, I'm having a similar problem right now, with regard to
loss of RAM capabilities.

I've been testing a new Polaroid 6500 sonar (which now works!) on the HB
and I've got it hooked up through the exp. board. I tried to run a simple
program that used actuated two servos, two motors, while polling one analog
input. It seemed to work without the Polaroid connected, but when I fired
it up with everything loaded on, it died, and now my HB can't seem to hold
it's RAM with the RJ11 cord connected to the charger/dler. I'm not completely
sure how the servos are powered/oscillated (etc.) so I haven't been able
to locate where I might have suffered some kind of power surge (possibly
from the sonar ranging board)... does it make any sense to think that
the sonar could have any affect on other periferals without being directly
powered up?... How ARE the servos on the Exp. Board driven?

thanks for any help,

John

p.s. On a somewhat different subject... I was wondering: Can the analog(n)
function be polled at any rate with success, or is it necessary to check
 the CCF flag on the ADCTRL register (0x1030) be checked before
everytime and before the call to analog()? I'm reading an analog port quite
rapidly and I just wanted to know if this precursory check needed to be done.
If so, is the same true with the exp. board analog ports?

THANKS!
