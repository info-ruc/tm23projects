There is an example of graphics files in Mike Ford's tutorial:


http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language/DMDX/dmdx_tutorial.html


In particular paradigm 7 (displaying graphics files):


http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language/DMDX/paradigms/parad7.html


There's also some information in my Powerpoint tutorial for DMDX:


http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/dmdx-tutorial/


In particular the page showing picture priming (picture then word
presentation):


http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/dmdx-tutorial/sld032.htm


To use the digital vox settings you need to add a couple of input devices
to the top line of your file. For example, the following section of a
file will do a single word naming experiment. It uses both Digital Vox
and Record Vocal with a time-out of 2 seconds. There's also quite a long
delay period (about 2.5 seconds) which helps ensure that there is
sufficient time for the machine to save files to the disk between items.
To change the file to display pictures you just add the keyword <<bmp> to
each frame.


Hope this helps,


Matt
