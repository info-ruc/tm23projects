Do you mean without?  That's my problem; the board only holds its data if
the cord is plugged in.

I've also got a servo which I can't figure out how to drive from the
exp. board, but the problem of the RAM discharging happens even with a
bare board (no exp., no lcd).

I'm convinced its a voltage problem and was going to try replacing the fuse
at F1 next.
