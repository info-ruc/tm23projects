Hello,

I have gotten DMDX to run and record RTs for my picture naming experiment.
I adjusted the VOX threshold to eliminate a Timeout error that I was
receiving, and it seems to be running fine, but before I collect the actual
data I have a couple of questions.

Is the computer's microphone (built-in on a laptop) sufficiently sensitive
to record the utterance onset time, or should I be using some type of more
sensitive microphone.

What would cause DMDX to record a RT for the first item, and then produce
the timeout error for following items?  Is there some way to know what an
appropriate VOX threshold is, or is it just trial and error?

Regarding DirectX:   The date of the DirectX program I have is Nov. 1999,
but I don't see what version of DirectX this is; is this DirectX 7?

Thanks in advance.
