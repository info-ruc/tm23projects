   They should be simultaneous, however it is conceivable that the video 
event is displayed before the PIO12 signal is sent.  My advice on this 
whole issue is to find a way to remove the errors, very few machines around 
here get any display errors at all (most of them are because people insist 
on using small <delay> values).  Try a clean install of the OS, don't have 
any other programs installed on the machine (esp. anti virus programs) or 
if you know how, remove all programs like the notorious M$ FastFind 
program.  Try a faster machine, if my celeron 400 with a TNT video _never_ 
gets display errors, I imagine you can find considerably less buff machines 
on which the same conditions will be met.  Try and get NVIDIA display 
adapters, the Riva 128 based cards were great.  Machines may have 
improperly configured network settings which can cause no end of display 
errors, having DHCP (or in M$ parlance, having the machine automatically 
obtain it's settings) turned on when there is no DHCP server and the 
settings are manually specified is a huge one.
