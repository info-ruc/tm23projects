Hi again,

Don't be confused la. I think you had made a little mistake. In order to
interface SSC with HB, the serial connection is not by the telephone line. The
connections is done by connecting the serial data pin on the SSC. Remind you
that it is a pin.....if you are still not sure, sent me a mail again, i give
you a photo about the connection.

Hopes help.
