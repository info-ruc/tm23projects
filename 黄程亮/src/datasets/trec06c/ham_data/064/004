Bob:

If you have major problems with the handyboard you would have better luck
with a logic analyzer than with an oscilloscope, however, I have build two
handy boards successfully without any of these tools straight out of the
box. Just be careful with solder bridges during assembly and keep it clean.
Also be careful with static electricity since all the chips used are ESD
sensitive. 

If you follow the steps per the HB website (which I did not), you will have
check stages at wich point you can still trouble shoot effectively at each
stage and know where thing go bad.

A logic probe is a device that will tell if a logic level is high (5V) or
low (~0V) (for TTL-levels). It can also tell if a signal is switching fast
from high to low by showing a blicking light. This is an inexpensive tool
that could help you out. However runaway software and trying to track the
instructions on the data bus and address bus is not possible with this tool.
My former employer (HP) quit making these neat little tools a long time ago.
They now sell the E2310A LogicDart, which is a lot more than what you need
and probably expensive.

Happy botting, Bart Schrijver Agilent Technologies.

Can somebody please tell if it is absolutely necessary to have an
oscilliscope for the assembly of and H board? If so, what are my INEXPENSIVE
options/suppliers? What is a logic probe? is it a 5vdc test lamp? Can I get
this kind of stuff at radio shack or will I needc to order it?

Thank You all
