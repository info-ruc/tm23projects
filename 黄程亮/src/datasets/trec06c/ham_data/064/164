Martin, I noticed a similar result as well. Maybe someone
else can say for sure, but I seem to remember that there
may be a way to slow down your interrupt counter, so that
it won't overflow (a timer setup register). I don't have
my 'HC11 book with me right now, but look into the section
on timers and interrupts (chapter 10 in the pink book).

Good Luck!

John
