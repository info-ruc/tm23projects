I have a really nice, and very expensive (somebody gave it to me), Tech 2432A
dual trace scope with storage.  I have also built about 20 boards of various
kinds, some of my own design.

The scope has lots of dust on it, although it looks great on the bench.  I turn
it on if someone is coming around I want to impress, but I've only used it once
that I really had to. That was just to get some software to drive a GP2D02 IR
module, and it was very handy in that case.  Bottom line, you don't need a
scope.  If all you ever get is a good digital volt meter, you can go a long
ways with that.

Good luck,
