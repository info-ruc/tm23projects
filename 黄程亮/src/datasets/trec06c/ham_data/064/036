Hi
	the servo ports on my expboard seem to work fine, but when the servos
are'nt active ( init_expbd_servos(0); ) and a motor is turned on the ports go
crazy , servos will turn eratically, with hacked servos they just move in one
direction. Would a filter cap help and if so were would one put it , in the
motor ports or servo supply?

Thanx -Alex

PS- now that I think about it could seperating the servo supply to a diff. batt
work?.

Thanx again.
