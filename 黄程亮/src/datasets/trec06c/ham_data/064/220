Subject: Using IC2/3 inputs w/interrupts in ASM?

One of my students wants to use the IC2/3 lines for a function on his LEGO
robot.  He needs to write an ISR for this particular line.  I've done this
many times with the 6811 under the BUFFALO monitor, but I don't know the
"side effects" likely if we do this under Interactive C?  Anyone know what
to expect?

I'm knowledgeable in ASM language, but never merged it with IC.

Thanks.
