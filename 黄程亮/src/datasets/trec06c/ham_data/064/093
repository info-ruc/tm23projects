I am having difficulty getting DMDX to display images.

My code is:

1 <bmp> "picture1" /;
2 <bmp> "picture2" /;
.
.
When I try to run a trial I receive the message "No media File found" and I
can't figure out what I'm doing wrong.  I have made sure the .rtf and .bmp
files are in the same folder, so I don't know why dmdx can't find the
graphics files.

Thank you.
