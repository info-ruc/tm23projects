re: this problem with the memory contents not persisting, check the
separate power supply to the RAM (U14).  you might need to remove all
socketed ICs from the board 'cause power can bleed to chips via input
pins.

also check that U12 the DS1233 is working.  when you turn the HB on,
the low batt led should come on for 1/3 sec.

i doubt it's the ram if things work normally otherwise.

btw the HM6264 chip is 64k *bits*, i.e., 8k bytes.  won't work, use
the 62256 variety.
