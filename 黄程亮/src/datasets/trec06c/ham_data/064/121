Hi Jonathan,

I think I may have misunderstood the way that the delay parameter functions
especially with zero or negative values. Can I run though my interpretation
of the above to confirm that I have got this straight. The delay parameter
is one of the main things that has caused confusion here in Cambridge, and
I want to make sure that I don't give out misinformation.

1) With a <delay> parameter of zero, the delay will be as short as it is
possible for the machine, but shouldn't go so fast as to cause a display
error. Is there any way of determining from the output file what delay was
produced on each trial? This would help in figuring out what the minimum
possible delay can be.

2) With a negative <delay> parameter, the delay will be as short as
possible, plus a fixed number of ticks. So <d -1) will be the minimum delay
plus one tick, <d -2> will be minimum delay plus two ticks etc.

3) With a positive <delay> parameter, the delay will be rounded up to this
number of ticks, *unless* the machine has difficulty loading and saving
files in this amount of time. In which case display errors can result. 

4) If the delay parameter is not set, there is a default value that is
invoked. I *think* this is about 50 ticks. Is that correct?

Thanks for the clarification.

Matt
