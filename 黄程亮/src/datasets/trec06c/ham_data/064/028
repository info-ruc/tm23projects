Acroname certainly seems to be the best source for the GP2D12 and Polaroi=

I'm a fool, too. That's why I went with the fully assembled & tested Hand=

I was just looking at the Sharp GP2D12 specs on-line the other night. Acc=
ording to the graph, the signal/distance curve is sort of logarithmic. St=
ill, unless you're mapping, the exact distance doesn't really matter anyw=

ues. Supposedly, you cut the pull-up resistor trace for port 0, and that'=
s supposed to float all eight analog ports on the expansion board. Sounds=
 too simple, eh?

I plan to use thin, clear Lexan (or some other brand of polycarbonate). I=
 would like to find a plastic bell jar and screw a flat disk into the bot=
tom of it, with holes cut for the wheels. I even thought about lopping of=
f the top and then reattaching it with a plastic "lazy susan" bearing and=
 servo motor, so that I'd end up with a small, clear plastic R2-D2 shape =
with a dome shaped turret for a head. That's where I'll put the sonar and=
 the video camera/transmitter. There's a plastics shop here in town that =
has a solvent glue specifically for use with polycarbonate. Until I gradu=
ate and have some free time though, I'll just have to make do with my Leg=
os.

I figure a color detector would be generally very useful. Some on this ma=
iling list have been experimenting with arrays of light detectors and col=
or filters. For ideas on what fun to have with a color detector, check ou=
t Sony's Aibo robotic dog. It can be "taught" to prefer objects of certai=
n colors and disdain others.

Best of luck!
