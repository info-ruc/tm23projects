Hello,

I've run into a problem setting up a picture naming experiment 
(with written distrator words):

  I think I have the parameters needed for the VOX device to record
utterance onset time, but trial runs have yielded the following:
	RTs of 1 (which I assume to be an error in the VOX digital device
	RTs of -2000 (the timeout set in the parameter line)  I've moved
the clock on keyword around, but I still haven't gotten this to work.

Here is my parameter line:

N4 <cr> <azk> <d 200> <s 2> <id "DigitalVOX"> <id 'keyboard"> <id
"recordvocal"> <dbc 255255255><dwc 0> <nfb><timeout 2000>
$0 "Press the spacebar to begin"$
+1 <TransparentBG> <bmp> "picture1" <ms%1>/* ! <ln 4> "word";
...etc.
My two questions are:
1.  How can I fix the timeout error that is occurring?
2.  Are there measures I can take to decrease the erroneous RTs (of, say,
1 ms)?

I'm working with a laptop, Inspiron 7500.

Thanks in advance to anyone who may know the answer.
