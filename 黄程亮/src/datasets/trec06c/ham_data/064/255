Hi everybody,
	I have a little Mac Plus (68000!) which has got 1Mb of RAM and
system 6.0.3 on it.  Running only the Finder (no Multifinder!), I just
discovered that I can run the INIT board and the IC applications with no
trouble whatsoever.  You should have no problems finding a machine that
will work for you (save for the 128K or 512Ke!)  :)

-Paul
