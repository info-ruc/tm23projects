The commercial version of IC offers the ability to declare multidimesional
arrarys (with freeware, you only can use single dimensiond arrays), commercial
IC allows #includes, and the user interface is somewhat more robust, making
debugging more straight forward.  However, the freeware version is very capable
as it is, and should present no real obstacles to your programming.

I have used both packages for several years, and personally I prefer the
commercial package for the few extra features it contains.  If you decide to
start with the freeware, you can upgrade to the commercial package later since
your IC programs developed with freeware will be upward compatable.

Good luck,
