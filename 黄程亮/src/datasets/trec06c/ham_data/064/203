   There is a new passpoint version of DMDX, 1.2.02b, on the website.  For 
those of you getting RTs of 1ms with the digital VOX please run this 
passpoint version and send me the passpoint file.  They are going to be 
obscenely large as this one contains all the samples in it, I get 800KB 
from a 5 item itemfile with RTs in the 2 second range, so don't use an item 
file with zillions of items.  Also, don't use an itemfile with the 
previously mentioned kludge in it to get things to work, I want to see the 
data when things are broken.

Nothing recedes like success.
