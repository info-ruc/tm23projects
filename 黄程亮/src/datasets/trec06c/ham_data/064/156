Hi,=20
I have connected sonar to my HB and it is time to analyse the data. =20

Is it true that the sonar range reading is in a cone shape at 30 deg. =
and not at point form ? I just can't find any information from the =
Polaroid home page.

Is anyone  there knows how to map using evidence grid method as =
published in Dr. Hans Moravec's "High Resolution Maps from Wide Angle =
Sonar?

Thanks.
William
