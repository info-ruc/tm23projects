Dear DMDX persons,

ok, now that I've found the solution to both the UNRECOGNIZED SWITCH
CHARACTER problem (items without proper quotes) and the 'is there an
aborted record' problem (it is in the Diagnostics file on the Desktop), I
have another problem.

Does anyone know how to have a scrambling routine work if the items in a
group are not of a constant number? I run into this problem because I'm
doing a 'moving window' sentence experiment, in which each word in the
window must have an item number. The problem is the sentences are not of
equal word length (the control sentneces aren't, at any rate), and so if I
use a group number of, say, eleven that is correct for most of the
sentences, the ones that don't have a length of eleven will mess up the
routine. 

I assume one way to fix it is with a dummy 'placeholder' that would be
added within groups to make them all  a consistent, maximum length. Does
anyone know if this is so, and if so, what a good 'placeholder' would be?

thanks,

Jerry P.
