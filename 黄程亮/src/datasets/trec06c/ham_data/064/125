Friends,

I have yet another problem I've been unable to solve. I keep getting the
message " UNRECOGNIZED SWITCH CHARACTER 's' " aborting my job. In the past
I've found the cause to be a misplaced space or dollar sign or something.
Now, I can't figure out what might be doing it. 

Also, since the program aborts, I can't find any file or record anywhere
that might give me more information about what might be causing the
problem. For example, the job, rtfparsed and scrambled files are not kept.
Is there a record kept somewhere when the process aborts? 

thanks,

Jerry P.
