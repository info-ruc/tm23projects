Subject: Pull-up resistors

I would like to attach a LM34 to my miniboard. In testing the LM34 at a room temperature of 60F, the device gives me a reading of .6V. The docs say that every 10mv=1F, so it seems to be working correctly. When I attach it to one of the analog ports on the miniboard, I get a reading of 151. If I do 151*(5/256), I get 2.95V. I am assuming the pull-up resistor is the cause of the difference. I don't want to cut out the pull-up resistor. Is there a way to calculate the affect of the pull-up resistor, so I don't need to remove it from the circuit?


I related question. I also want to use 2 cds on one analog input. Ideally, a reading of 128 would mean that both cds are getting the same amount of light. If the left photocell is getting more light, then the number should be less than 128. Again, I think that the pull-up resistor is affecting the readings. Is there a way that I can get this to work, without modifing the Handyboard or miniboard?


As you can probably tell, I know next to nothing about electronics.


Thanks
