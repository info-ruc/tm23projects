Hi Everyone!
It looks like Frankie Lai has found a way to interface the sonar I have on
my site to the HB.  Here are his comments:

hihi,
me again......I think you know already, but I would like to precise it.
The echo line through NOT gate is then connect to port A0, that is the
sensor input 7 on HB.

Thanks Frankie!
