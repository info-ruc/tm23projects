hello.

i used the wrong dc adapter (15v) to power my hb today.  i made the switch to
the proper adapter (12v) fairly quickly, and things seemed fine - i was able
to download the pcode.  but when i rebooted the board, the power died and i've
not been able to revive it.  there is no sign of life, no lights, lcd etc.

i imagine the extra voltage did damage.  does this sound right?  is there a
fix?

thanks in advance,
claudia
