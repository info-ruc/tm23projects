Hello,

I am looking for some sample scripts to use as models for a picture naming
experiment I am setting up in DMDX.  Does anyone have something like this,
or know of a website where I might find some?  My 'net searches have turned
up empty.  I have been using the http://mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language.DMDX
site, but I haven't found samples for displaying graphics or for the VOX
input.

I'd be grateful for any suggestion on where to look.  Thank you.
