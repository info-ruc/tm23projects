   Ok, I have been corrected, it appears that there is a work around for 
the RTs of 1ms occuring with some systems that are allergic to the new 
Digital Vox and that is to _specify_ the time limit in each item.  What 
this does is to force DMDX to reinitialize the DirectSoundCapture subsystem 
every item, the RT 1 problem appearing to occur some arbitrary time after 
the first item this kludge fixes the problems.  I would still recommend 
installing DirectX 7.0 before relying on this fix however.
