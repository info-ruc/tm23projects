Hi Todd,
  I'll answer the best I can.

As long as the relay doesn't require more current than the motor driver chip
can handle. You can always bridge the motor outputs together for higher
current. The motor chip has the built in diode, so you won't need to do
anything special.

As far as

Yes, the digital ins are pulled high. You can short them to ground to make
them go low when the switch closes.

  and the analog inputs for photo type sensors where the

Yep.

I wouldn't want to rely on the batteries not going dead when the unit was
unplugged. As Jake pointed out, IC will startup with main() when the
handyboard is turned on. You'll need to mod the HB and hook up a relay into
the 120V power to turn the HB on when the unit is powered up.

good luck,
