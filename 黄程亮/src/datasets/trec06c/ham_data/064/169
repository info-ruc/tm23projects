   Set the VOX threshold appropriatly.

   The trouble is I don't have a machine here that I can replicate these 
problems on so I can't very well diagnose them.  As far as I can tell it's 
a problem with the machine's DirectSoundCapture drivers and the only thing 
that's different between machines that exhibit the trouble and the ones 
that don't is that the machines that work all have DirectX 7.0 installed on 
them, so you might want to try that.

   Come to think of it, maybe all the broken machines are Dell laptops.
