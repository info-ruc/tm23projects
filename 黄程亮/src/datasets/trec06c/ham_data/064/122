   Not in the data file, it's stored in diagnostics.txt as the preparation 
times, somewhere in the DMDX help file I detail what the A and B 
preparation times are and how to use them to intelligently determine what a 
<delay> parameter should be.  You could use the <RecordClockOnTime> or 
<rcot> keyword however.

   Yep, check the <Delay> docs, IIRC D0 is actually a synonym for D-1 
(maybe D-2).

   Yep.

   Yeah, I think it's 48 ticks.
