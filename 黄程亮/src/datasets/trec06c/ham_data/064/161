That sounds correct. Someone else asked about that last year. Try searchi=
ng the mailing list archives.

The problem is not just that the result is an integer, but that it's a si=
gned integer. You effectively only get 15 bits of information out of it. =
If you could figure out a way to interpret the answer as an unsigned, the=
n you could effectively get up to twice the maximum range.

Of course, that still wouldn't get you the maximum available from the har=
dware, about 10.6 meters. To do that, you'd need at least an 18-bit count=
er (i.e., a long integer). Perhaps you could figure out how to change jus=
t the IC code to count (in a separate variable) how many times the counte=
r wraps around? Best of luck!
