   You will have to test it and see.  My guess is that it is going to be a 
horrible piece of junk but you never can tell when some gem will be found.

   Try running that latest passpoint I just released and send me (not the 
list) the dmdxpass.txt file so I can see what the data is looking like.

   You should have a file on your machine in Program Files / DirectX / 
Setup, it should be called DxDiag if DirectX 6 or 7 is installed, run it, 
it will tell all details about you install and even let you test the 
various componants on DirectX.
