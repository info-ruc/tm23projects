Subject: Using ICC11 with the handy board
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Dear Sir or Madam,

Let me preface this email by saying that I am an extreme novice at
programming microprocessors so please try not to laugh to hard at my
questions. 

I recently started an electronics project for which I chose to use the
handy board as a controller.  Unfortunately, I need to operate at speeds
significantly faster then the 1 kHz system interrupt allows.  Keep in mind
that I do not need the functionality of the LCD display even though it
would be nice.  Anyway, I did some research and found that Imagecraft's
ICC11 compiler would provide me with a means of simplifying the use of
interrupts, provide for faster routines and still allow me to program in C.  

Here is my dilemma.  To perform bootstrap mode programming, the ICC11
manual states that I must, "...Refer to the target system reference on how
to set the system to run in this mode."  I know that resetting the system
while holding down the start button puts the HB in bootstrap download mode,
however, I'm quite certain that the bootload program provided with the HB
sets up the system interrupt that I do not want. Imagecraft provides a HB
library, however, I would still be left with the system interrupt problem.
How do I set up the HB to accept programs I've developed using ICC11
without the constraint of a 1 kHz system interrupt?  

Thank you for our assistance.
