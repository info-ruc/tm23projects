Subject: [9fans] FD Formatting on some CPUs

Hello,

A few days ago, I said that
	A> b fd!0!9pcdisk
fails to detect 9pcdisk on FD on some CPUs(K6-2 300MHz and 350MHz).

I found more curious phenomena.
Dos command:
	format a:/s
is unstable! Format command  sometimes fails to detect FD! 
On the other hand, we have no trouble on formatting FD on Win98 or WinNT.
Experiments is done using Dos version 6.3 on K6-2 300MHz and K6-2 350MHz.

I asked to one of my friends (SE of our university) if  he had a similar experience.
His answer is YES.

How is your PCs?
