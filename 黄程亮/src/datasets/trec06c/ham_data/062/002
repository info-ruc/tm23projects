It may be because you use the wrong lib_hb.c.  There is one that works with
the expansion board (one without digital(), analog() and raw_analog()
defined, but the expsenc.c will define them so that the I/O port on the
expansion board will work).  It happened to me when I used the  lib_hb.c
from the "Smooth PWM Routines" (downloaded from HB homepage) with expansion
board.  I went in lib_hb.c and commented out the digital(), analog(), and
raw_analog().  See if that helps.

Hi all,

   I had a handyboard and an expansion board, they do not work together. I
had
definitely unzipped the explib into the libs directory and overwrote the
files
it need. But a strange problem occurs, when the board is downloading files
at
expsenc.c and hb_lib.icb, it said "analog already defined", "digital already
defined" and "raw_analog already defined".

   I had try that to use the handyboard only with its own files, it works
pretty good. But when work with exp board and exp files, the problem occurs.
I
had brorrowed an exp board from my friend, the same problem occur.

   My question is do anyone know what had happened on my boards? It seems
that
there is no problem on the exp board, I think the problem is on handyboard,
is
there any components burnt?? And what can I do with the boards???

Thank you very much
