Yes you are right, i just figured out too. i have to give at least 0.3secs
for the servo to move to the required position.

actually the servo doesn't move when you turn it off. if you don't turn it
off some small movements are observed. i think its due to some small changes
in the pulse timing. so i found it is better to actually move to the
required position and turn the servo off. this way it holds it position
firmly.

cheers again

What is it supposed to be doing?  When you say _it_ doesn't work, what
exactly is not working?  I'm not that familiar with the routines but it
looks like you're shutting off the servos before they can move.  I also
believe once you turn off the servo it won't hold it's position any
longer.
