CAVEAT: I'm probably full of it, but here goes....

My understanding is that a 12 V NiCd battery pack would not
damage the HB, since the HB can handle up to 12 V. The problem
is that in order to charge a 9.6 V battery pack, the HB built
in charging circuit delivers about 12 V, which isn't enough to
charge a 12 V battery. So a 12 V battery would have to be
unplugged from the HB and recharged with a charger designed for
12 V batteries.

I actually hope I'm wrong about this, and that somebody out
there corrects me. I too have a 12 V pack that I would really
like to use with the HB.
