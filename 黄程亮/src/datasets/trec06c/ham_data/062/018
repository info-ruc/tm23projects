Yes. Exactly the right point. The two different things to woory about, are the
mA/Hr rateing of the battery (which tells you how long a particular current
can be delivered), and the _internal resistance_ of the battery, which limits
the maximum current it can deliver. Now if you take some examples. The small
batteries used in some 'micro' radio controlled cars, have mA/Hr rateings of
just 500mA/Hr, but are run at currents (in some cases) as high as 15Amps,
giving a battery like usually measured in just a couple of minutes. If shorted
through a system only rated at 700mA, these can blow it just as easily as a
much larger battery. In the case of the Lego battery pack for the 9v motors,
few people realise, that this actually contains a 'self resetting' thermal
fuse, just to prevent a short from damageing anything else (it is a tiny 3/8
inch 'disk' hidden behind one of the battery clips). So the answer if you want
to use a larger capacity 'pack', is to use one as large as you want (provided
it is the right coltage of course), but limit the maximum current with a
similar fuse (or a conventional one, though obviously this has the
disadvantage of needing replacement if too much current is drawn). So
something like a 500mA self resetting fuse, and a 10A/Hr battery can be fine,
when much smaller batteries without the current limit of the fuse, could cause
problems

Best Wishes
