Anyone know how to connect the Hamamatsu P5587 to the Handy Board(with an
expansion) Schematic or pins-out would be great.

If your sensor output port already taken, is there any other port on the handy
board we can use to connect the Hamamatsu P5587?

What test routine do we have to use?

Any help would be really appriciated.

Thanks,
Michael.
