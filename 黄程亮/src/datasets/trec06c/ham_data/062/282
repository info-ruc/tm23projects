Hi,
has anyone experimented with light sensors?  My group is working on a 
mama and a baby robot this semester and would like to control baby's
movement by using sometype of sensors.  We are thinking of mounting sonar
sensor to the mamabot so that it could navigate around the room and maybe
mount light generating source so that babybot could follow the light.  
Any ideas?
Thanks.

Lee
