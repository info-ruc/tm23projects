Hi.  Tried running tachtest.rtf and that works.  The script itself runs,
however, the timing seems to be odd.  DMDX times correctly between items
but seems unable to time correctly the frames within an item.  I've checked
everything (as far as I can) in TimeDX and the millisecond timing seems
good.  The vertical retrace sync thread seems not to be missing refreshes,
in fact seems very good.  The script itself works fine on my PC, however
when we run it on the Dell 3700 it seems to go odd.  For any item the
second frame is flashed up very briefly whatever the display parameter or
switch says.  The first frame in the item is displayed fine.  Just running
single frame items - the timing is fine.
e.g. for.....

100 <fd 100> "hello" / <fd 300> "world";

...the second item will be not be displayed for the specified time.  Quite
but no always there is an error message about the frame being 155 ticks
late.  Can't understand why timing would be affected within but not between
items.

Thanks

- Mike
