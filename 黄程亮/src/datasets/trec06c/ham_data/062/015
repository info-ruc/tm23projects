Oh, you are missunderstands some "electrical" details :)
You can use a battery pack with 9.6V and 2000 mA or more if you like,
because the unit is exactly mA/h.

It means you can get this current over a time of one hour. Or the
half current over 2 hour's.

The current of the motor chip is only limited of the resistor (from 
motor and the cables to the motor). That the reason why you can't use
a "big" motor with the L293. The Motor get's too much current.
(but you can limit the current with a resistor) 

hope it helps :)
