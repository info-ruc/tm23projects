Hi,
In the kit you will find a number of pulleys about 1 inch in diameter.  These
are narrow enough to fit through the sensor.  They have six holes in them and
if they are on an axle, will give you 12 pulses per revolution - 2 pulses per
hole. One when the sensor starts seeing the hole and one when it stops seeing
the hole.  They work great.
