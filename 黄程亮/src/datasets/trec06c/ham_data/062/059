John,

The 1 KHz system interrupt is set up in the IC pcode, which you are not
loading.  Furthermore, the bootloader for the Handy Board is loaded into the
first 255 bytes of on-chip RAM when you load pcode, and disappears on reset.
It can't cause you a problem either.  In addition, there is no system
interrupt that is invoked automatically by being in download mode or special
test mode.  You should have no such difficulty, at least as far as I am aware.

Keep in mind that the Handy Board is hard wired to run in special test mode on
reset, so the reset vector and the other vectors are remapped from $FFCO-$FFFF
to $BFCO-$BFFF.

Also note that you can use the display even though you are not running IC.
The ICC compiler comes with libraries for the Handy Board, and one of them
will run the display as I recall.

Good luck, and have fun.
