Use the encoder routines from the HB web site:

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/encod=
ers.html

With these, you can use any of the analog ports (i.e., you don't have to =
use ports 0 and 1 first). I have the sonar hooked up to the expansion boa=
rd, too, so I have my encoders running on ports 2 & 3. It works great. Be=
st of luck!
