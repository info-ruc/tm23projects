   Ok, I'm tired of sticking things in for the 1.2.00 release, here's 
what's new:

   -- looped DirectDoundCapture buffers for DigitalVox device without the 
RecordVocal device, which means that if you use the DigitalVOX device and 
want a timeout of 20 seconds you can have it, when the subject responds 
DMDX will move on to the next item without waiting the full twenty seconds

   -- extended digital vox triggering, a new sibilant threshold is added 
and sampling over a user specified window to reduce lip smacks etc. has 
been added

   -- capture buffer create crash fixed

   -- item files can be dragged into a DMDX icon to run that item file

   -- added a mutex to stop TimeDX and DMDX running simultaneously

   -- I investigated whether comments were affecting overall item file 
display time, they are not, so I don't know what the cause of C. Fort's 
timing troubles are

   -- bell no longer sounds if audio used

   -- remote monitor bell sounds if remote monitoring used

   -- two new keywords, <visuallysignalexperimenter> and 
<acousticallysignalexperimenter>

   -- animate switch always clears buffers before hand to get rid of those 
stray bits of previous displays that could occur with the first usage of 
the animate switch
