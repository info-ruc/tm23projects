Voltage and resistance have no relation to each other - they are two different things.

The HB analog inputs convert the voltage level applied to them to a digital equivalent, basically an A/D converter.  So, you can apply your 0 - 5 volt signal directly to one of the analog inputs and use the resulting code.

You think you ask dumb questions?  I am an analog EE who knows very little programming as I have proven in this forum many times.

Good luck.
