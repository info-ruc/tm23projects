I've looked high and low for info on the P5587. - it's like the thing
doesn't exists.  I even went to Hamamatsu's web sight ... nothing!  The
only info I've found was a message in this newsgroup.  Below is a copy
of it.  I haven't hooked mine up yet so I can't vouch for its content.
When you get it working, please post what you did back to this newsgroup.
I'm very interested.

Good luck,
   Rick
