hi all,

  I had post a message about the exp board days before. Actually, the problem
had not been solved yet. I post the following message that was shown when I
was trying to load the exp files to the board. I don't know why this happen,
since my friends' boards have not got the same problem with the same
configurations.


Synchronizing with board
Pcode version 3.10 present on board
Loading C:\IC\libs\lib_hb.lis.
Loading lib_hb.c.
Loading C:\IC\libs\lib_hb.icb.
Loading C:\IC\libs\libexpbd.icb.
Loading C:\IC\libs\expsens.c.
Loading C:\IC\libs\expservo.icb.
Loading C:\IC\libs\explego.icb.
C:\IC\libs\expsens.c(13): analog already defined
C:\IC\libs\expsens.c(34): digital already defined
lib_hb.icb(1): _raw_analog already defined
Errors, unloading files
Cannot find file lib_hb.lis or file lib_hb.lis
C:\IC\libs\expsens.c(13): analog already defined
C:\IC\libs\expsens.c(34): digital already defined
lib_hb.icb(1): _raw_analog already defined


When I delete the "expsens.c" and "lib_hb.icb" from the list, the board works.
But I think there is something wrong.

If there is any possible solutions, please let me know.
Thanks for your kindly attention.
