Hi all you to all you guys in the HB world!,

	Found a old RC system for a air plane. Works fine with the 1 servo it had 
left, my question is how would one go about useing it with the HB? hooked 
one of the outputs to a analog port and got the P.W.M. signal of about 230 
to 250. What I'd like to do is control one of the motor ports with the 
signal, so you push forward on the stick robot moves forward , left bot 
turns etc and possibly use the other 2 channels to send codes. Any way 
system is 4 channels, any ideas? someone out there possibly alerady made a 
driver of this sort?
Thanx for you help!  : ^ )

-Alex
