Also, if you don't want your motherbot to have a "light-bulb" on it...
You can get an infrared LED (or a few to make it brighter) and use the same
concept Barry mentioned.
To get the best result in sensitivity it way be wise to match the peak
wavelength.
The sensitivity curve is usually like a bell so the further away from the
peak you are, the less it will detect.
Check the specs and try to get the closest match.
Order from Mouser to get more of a variety of choices if Radio Shack doesn't
do.
