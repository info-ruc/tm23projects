Hi John,

Using compiled programs with the Handyboard is not difficult, the steps
used to download a compiled program are exactly the same as downloading the
"pcoder" file in the Handyboard documentation. The compiled program is used
instead of the pcoder_hb.s19 file. 

There are several things to be aware of;

1) Unlike IC, when using a compiled program you must put the board in
download mode each time you wish to change the program. That means that you
need the board physically near you while programming.

2) Memory on the Handyboard is somewhat fragmented, in part because the way
the handboard runs (Motorola Special Test Mode) puts the interrupt vectors
at the top of the BF00 (or B600?) page. Anyway, icc11 can deal with it
better than IC does but it needs to be understood.

3) The Handyboard library with icc11 includes (IMNSHO) better LCD support
than IC (I wrote it so I'm biased :-). However it does use a 1Khz system
interrupt to be somewhat compatible with IC timings, it doesn't have to use
a 1Khz interval. Further, if you look at the code that handles encoders you
will see that it can run at pretty much any schedule you desire.
