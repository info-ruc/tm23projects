Hi.. i have some questions about the exp. board and R/C servo, hope anyone can
help me.. thanks..

From the "Expansion board software" homepage, it said that servo0=(value) is
used to control the servo, may i ask how can i convert this value to "degree" ?
i.e. if i want to turn the servo to 0 deg, 30 deg, 60 deg...etc.. what value
should I input ?? Thanks for your help...
