Is there a general guide to what fuse I should have with a certian current?  
Please excuse some of this if it doesn't make sense, I am learning a lot of 
electrical concepts as I go...

Would the internal resistance of the battery be shown if I measure the 
resistance across the terminals (my DMM does not display the batteries 
resistance, out of range)

Should I really be taking my measurements from the capacitor(?) which is 
the first component the trace leads too?

Again.. soory for my lack of knowledge... but I am learning.. really : >
