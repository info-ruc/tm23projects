Yes, there is a way. Check out the serial servo controllers at
http://www.seetron.com/ssc.htm

Each one of these that you use controls up to 8 servos, and you
can chain a bunch of them together and go servo nuts.

P.S. -- I haven't yet tried these myself. I'm curious about how
well they work (and how to hook 'em up and write code for them)
with the HB. Anyone?
