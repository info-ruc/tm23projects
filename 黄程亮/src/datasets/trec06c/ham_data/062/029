you are confusing mAh capacity (the amount of energy stored in the
battery) with how fast the batt can deliver the power.

the two are not the same.

the fuse is in the design because nicad cells can deliver a
*DANGEROUS* amount of power if shorted.

DANGEROUS, as in wires will melt from the heat, and the cells can
explode.

so i DEFINITELY do NOT recommend replacing the fuse with a wire.

if you stick a phone cable of the wrong polarity into the RJ11 jack,
or heaven forbid, a shorted phone cable, you'd be shorting the nicad
pack and BAD, BAD THINGS can happen.

so, the fuse is there for a good reason.


re: the discussion on using 12v rather than 9.6, there's not a big
problem with this.

it would put additional stress on the 7805, so check that it's not
getting too hot.

you would need to up the adapter to 15v, 500 ma (from 12v, 500ma) to
make sure you have adequate charge voltage.

in closing, let me reiterate:  DO NOT REPLACE THE FUSE WITH A WIRE.
thank you.  please practice safe handy-boarding.
