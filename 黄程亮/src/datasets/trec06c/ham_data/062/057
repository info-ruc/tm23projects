   Could well be, it has been used so it works (or worked in the 
past).  It's possible that there's some conflict between using embedded RTF 
colors and using the default writing color switches.  You might try 
creating the item file in the colors you want in Word and if DMDX displays 
white on white just change the default background color.  Also, ISTR that 
to get RTF feedback colors used you had to specify the text in quotes.
