As IC loads each file, it reports how many bytes each one
occupies. Just add 'em up.

The IC interpreter is said to occupy approximately half of the
32 kB available, so if your code gets up to about 16 kB total,
then you need to worry about trying to simplify control
structures, re-use variables, etc. to save code space.
