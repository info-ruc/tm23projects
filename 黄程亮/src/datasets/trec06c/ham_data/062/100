The problem is simply that the new expansion board code
supercedes a couple of functions in the old lib_hb.c (and
possibly in lib_hb.icb, too; I can't remember).

If you go to the HB web site, you'll find a new version of
lib_hb that's compatible with the expansion board code (i.e.,
it has the old versions of the functions removed from lib_hb).
Best of luck!
