I'm trying to set up DMDX on my Elonex Piranha laptop (Celeron 366) and I
get the following error as soon as I run Timedx:

DirectDrawCreate failed
DDERR_CANTCREATEDC (88760249)
Windows can not create any more DCs

Anyone know what might be going wrong here? (I'm running Windows 98, by the
way).

The first time I ran Timedx I got a menu of graphics drivers to choose
from, but every time since I've just got this error message.

thanks,

Sam
