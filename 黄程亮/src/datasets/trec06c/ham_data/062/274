   Hmm, that's a good one.  What happened after you got to choose which 
graphics driver?  My guess is that because old versions of TimeDX leave the 
last graphics device as the default (when they should be leaving the first 
as the default) you have chosen something that can't work like someone 
recently did.  You need to delete all the TimeDX registry keys and then 
when TimeDX is run again choose the first graphics driver, probably 
something like "Primary Display".  Next version of TimeDX has all this 
fixed, however I'm not releasing it for at least a few days as there are 
features of DMDX not working right now.  If looking up the archives for 
those instructions and editing the registry is too daunting I can make just 
the new version of TimeDX available if you want.
