Time for Spring Term packet preparations! First thing to do is fax (485-6253) 
or email (Copy-Shop@worldnet.att.net) JUST your bibliography to The Copy Shop 
so we can get your copyright clearances taken care of.  Please hurry, so we 
can get started and have the packets ready for your students by beginning of 
term.
 
Let me know if I can help in any way or call the Copy Shop direct at 
485-6253. 

Thank you we look forward to making your packets for this coming term.
