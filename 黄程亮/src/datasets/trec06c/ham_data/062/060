Dear HB,

I am trying to convert an anolog voltage from a thermocoupler to a digital
value and display it on the LCD. I thought this could be accomplished by
changing the high reference voltage V(rh) from the default 5V to 600mV to
get the max resolution over a range from  0V to 600mV. It looks like the
5V(rh) is set on pin 52 of the processor thru a cap connected to pin 22 if
memory chip U2. 

I initially thought I could use the pot (VR1) to adjust V(rh) but from the
schematic it looks like this only adjusts the input to AN7

Can anyone offer suggestions. 

Thanks much,
