ICANN Launches Membership Web Site for Individual Internet Users<br>
<br>
Marina del Rey, CA, USA, (25 February 2000) The Internet Corporation for<br>
Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) announces the launch of its At Large<br>
Membership web site.<br>
<br>
After considerable public input, the ICANN Board has developed this program<br>
as a new way for Internet users from all over the globe to participate<br>
directly in the ICANN process and help ensure the smooth coordination of the<br>
Internet's technical infrastructure. Individuals can begin registering today<br>
to become ICANN members at <a  href="http://www.icann.org">http://www.icann.org</a>. &lt;<a  href="http://members.icann.org">http://members.icann.org</a>&gt;.<br>
<br>
The At Large Membership of ICANN will give individual members of Internet<br>
communities worldwide a voice in the selection of Directors to the ICANN<br>
Board. By becoming an ICANN member, individuals will have an opportunity to<br>
become part of the ICANN &quot;bottom-up&quot; approach to making policy concerning<br>
Internet Names and Addresses. ICANN members will be able to receive regular<br>
news, updates and announcements about ICANN activities and policy<br>
initiatives.<br>
<br>
The basic requirements for applying to become an ICANN At Large member are:<br>
* The completion of an online membership application,<br>
* A working Internet email address; and<br>
* A single physical residence verified by a postal mail address.<br>
<br>
Thanks to a grant from the Markle Foundation, the initial launch of ICANN's<br>
At Large Membership program has been funded without the need for membership<br>
dues.<br>
<br>
The ICANN Board will consider and adopt further policy about composition and<br>
structure of the At Large Membership, and to establish rules for the<br>
nomination and election of candidates for the At Large Council, at the<br>
Board's next meeting, to be held March 9-10. It is hoped that the target<br>
goal of 5000 members can be reached in the next few weeks in order to move<br>
forward with the At Large Elections later this year.<br>
