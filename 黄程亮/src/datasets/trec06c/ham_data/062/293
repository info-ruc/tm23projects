I've tried their product before - the company is once the DVP.com.  And it
cannot transmit at 9600 baud which they tried to claim using their crystal
caps.  And the CS is not really that good.  I am not quite sure now since it
has a new name - probably they've changed.

I have had a success transmitting at 200 bps to 400 bps.  but  quite noisy!

How about the radiometrix - Bif-418???
