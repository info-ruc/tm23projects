This calls for a signal conditioning amplifier. Since you're not worried 
particularly about slew rate (the handyboard won't do much more than 12khz 
sample rate) you can pretty much use any op-amp you want. Ideally you'd use 
a single supply one, set the gain for slightly less than 9 (actually 5/.6) 
and then feed your signal across a resistor into the op-amp.
