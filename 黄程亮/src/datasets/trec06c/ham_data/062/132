Hi all,

A funny thing happened. i tried to download a file. IC gave the message it
was downloading, but just when it finishes it gives me an error saying "lost
synch with board". then i unloaded some files and redownloaded the file
again. this time no error.

is this because the HB memory is full? how would i know how much of the RAM
is still free, or how much is taken up by programs?

cheers
M Fazal
