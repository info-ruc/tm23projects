	I have written some library code which allows user programs to
effectively hog_processor() for a user-specified time interval, instead of
the 256 msec allowed by hog_processor().  The new functions are:

void lock_process(float seconds)	;locks out all other running
					;processes for time seconds.
					;time can range from .001-4294967
					;seconds.  (The counter is a 32-bit
					;msec counter.)

void unlock_process()			;unlocks the lock_process() lock and
					;swaps to the next process, allowing
					;multitasking to resume.

lock_process() installs a timer tick daemon which manages the counter and
prevents the current process from being swapped out, based upon the state of
a global enable flag.  The daemon is an .icb file.

lock_process() requires the hog_processor() function from lib-???.c and
the int2uf() function from my math.c library.  lock_process() works on both
Handy Boards and 6.270 boards.

The files are available via anonymous ftp at:

	Please let me know if you find any bugs or have any comments.

	Fred, feel free to add these to the appropriate area of the Handy
Board website.
