The self-resetting thermal fuse that's part of the HB ought to
be just fine (see item F1 on the HB schematics). I think that
if you use a 9.6 V NiCd battery pack with less than a couple
thousand mAH capacity, you probably have nothing to worry
about.

Be aware, though, that not all HBs ship with the F1 fuse. I got
mine from Patrick Hui of the Robot Store HK, and it had just a
wire where the fuse goes. Not that I had any problem with that
-- he told me before I ordered the board that it wouldn't have
the fuse. Just for my own peace of mind, I ordered the fuse and
installed it myself. You might want to verify that you have
component F1 before you experiment with bigger batteries.

Another thing to consider is that a 12 V battery pack would
probably not damage the HB, except that it would be a hassle to
recharge, because the HB internal charging circuitry is not
designed to deliver a high enough voltage. You'd have to unplug
it from the HB each time and plug it into the proper charger. I
looked into this, because I have a camera and video transmitter
that runs on 12 V, and I wanted to use a single battery pack
for everything. Unless I can figure out how to hack the HB
charging circuit to charge a 12 V pack, I figure it's not worth
the trouble.

I don't really know how to measure the internal resistance of a
battery pack. You shouldn't need to, though, because your HB
and motors will probably blow the fuse long before the internal
resistance of the battery starts to be an issue. Best of luck!
