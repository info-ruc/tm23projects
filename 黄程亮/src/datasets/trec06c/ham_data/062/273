   Yep, you're confused.  It fails when you've been using spaces and 
succeeds when not.  If you are getting correct 1 all the time then the vox 
is triggering all the time, you need to calibrate the vox, if it's not 
triggering there and you are still getting continuous triggering then the 
problem lies elsewhere.
