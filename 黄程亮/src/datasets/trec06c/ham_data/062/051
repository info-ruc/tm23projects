Hi.  I am having some problems trying to work out how to get colour
feedback when using other than the default colourings, i.e when the RTF
colour has been overridden.  I can't seem to get DMDX override the default
colours set in the parameter.  I am trying to get my experiment to have
white text on a black background with colour feedback, but only during a
practice session.  The main part of the experiment should have no feedback.
 It could just be that it is Friday afternoon, I am tired and am thinking
of that first warm frothy beer in that smokey pub.

Thanks.

- Mike
