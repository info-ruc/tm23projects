Whatever portion of the 40 mA that the HB requires for it's
operation will "float over" the battery pack and be consumed by
the board. The rest goes into the battery to recharge it.

I haven't measured the current draw of my robot, but of course
your results will vary depending on how active your robot is. A
good estimate of current draw could be found by first
completely charging your battery, then timing how long the
robot runs until the battery's drained. The average current
draw will be the mAH capacity of your battery divided by how
many hours it took to run it down.

If the board (and motors, etc.) demand more than 40 mA, then
none of the current supplied by the solar panel will go into
the battery, but at least the battery won't discharge as
quickly as it would have without any solar power.

BTW, I picked up this concept from a recent article about
hybrid gas/electric vehicles in a most excellent magazine
called Home Power.

That robotic arm on the web looks like fun. Hard to say how
efficient the motors are. Still, it looks like it's just
begging to be mounted on top of an R/C tank. Then you could
program the whole thing to serve cocktails to your guests!
