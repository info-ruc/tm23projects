These are what I also have been trying to use to break the beam, they seem to
be the best choice. My question was more about how you mounted the sensor. I'm
curious to know what piece people had glued the sensor to, and to see if they
used some sort of jig to make sure the sensor was aligned properly before you
began glueing.

Thx :)
