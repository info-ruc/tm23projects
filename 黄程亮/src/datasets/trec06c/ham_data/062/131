I am looking to purchase a small light laptop which will run DMDX.
Here at the CSL we are currently using Dell Inspirons, but are looking for
something both smaller and lighter, which is therefore more easily portable.

Does anybody have any suggestions for either laptops to avoid or those which
fit what I am looking for and have been known to run DMDX without problems?

Any information greatly appreciated,

Thanks,

Stu
