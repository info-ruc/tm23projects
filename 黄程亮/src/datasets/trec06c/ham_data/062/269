I was wondering if anyone might be able to help - my student is trying to record participant voice onset times and what they say. 

His parameter line and first item is below.

N80 <azk> <s8> <t3500> <dbc 000000000> <dwc 255255255> <id keyboard> <id Digital VOX> <id Record Vocal>

$
0 "Ready?";
$
+1 *"CHOOSE";

etc.

It works fine on my MicroPro 366 mhz Pentium 11 notebook - but not on his "Twin Head" brand Pentium 233 mhz - It runs, but the vox appears to trigger instantly, giving a feedback "correct1" for each item. I checked to see that he'd turned off the internal mike (he had). Dmdxpass gives the  following message: - <id DigitalVox> selection failed. Any ideas?

Many thanks. Chris
