The Topen message generates a permission check and enables I/O. Before
the open, you may not read or write on the fid.  There is no close (well, there
is, but it's called clunk) because you must dispose of fids that have not been
Topened, so it seemed that Tclose would be the wrong name for the operation.

The manual says somewhere I believe, and the code says somewhere I know,
that once a fid is opened, it cannot be walked or cloned further.  This avoids
some difficult implementation problems for the servers.
