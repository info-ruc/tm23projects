   Just found a subtle little error as I'm working through the enhanced vox 
code, some values of the time limit could cause the capture buffer create 
code to fail.  This failure is not due so much to the length of the time 
limit but to the fact that it caused a calculation to produce an odd number 
when it should have always produced an even number, changing the time limit 
slightly will more than likely fix the error.  The error when it was 
encountered also caused DMDX to crash badly if both the RecordVocal and the 
DigitalVox device were used.  I'm notifying the list as I don't expect I'll 
be releasing the next version of DMDX for a while, there are a number of 
other things I would like to clean up before the next release.
