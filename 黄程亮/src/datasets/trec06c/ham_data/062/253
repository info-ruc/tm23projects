   Hmm, then TimeDX's tachistoscopic acid test is a better test than I 
realized, or at least it's error checking is better than expected 
anyway.  Sounds like the video circuitry in that particular model is 
suspect and the request to flip from one video page to the next is done 
immediately instead of waiting for the retrace to actually occur.

   I take it you mean second frame.  It never would be even if everything 
was working, once the current frame is up DMDX proceeds to the next frame, 
the frame duration only specifies when the next frame is to be displayed 
and if there is no next frame the frame duration is meaningless, this is 
ancient DMastr design, don't blame me.

   Because between items it's simply waiting, between frames it's flipping 
video pages and possibly moving video data as well (if there are very few 
video buffers due to limited video memory).  My guess given the 155 tick 
error that video hardware just doesn't cut the mustard.  The only thing you 
can try doing is to fiddle with the timing parameters as I suggest in a 
couple of places in the help, reduce the sleep time so that DMDX flips the 
video pages earlier.

   Is that a Dell 3700 (as you indicate in this email) or actually 7300 as 
your original indicates?  If the hardware is indeed failing it's quite 
surprising in a later model, the earlier stuff is not too 
surprising.  Perhaps it's some budget model (usually their numbers are 
"pure", 7000 and so forth) and has cut down hardware that's a bit too cut 
down for our purposes.
