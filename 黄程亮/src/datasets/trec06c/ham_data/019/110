Hi  all,

Still having downloading problems with pcode_hb.s19
I think i have almost tried everything but change the ram, and still the
board does not wake up.
Can anyboady inform me also about the status of the Charge LED on the HB
board, what should it do, mine is always off, the led never comes on.,
although all 5Volt is present .

Thks
Luc Bodson
