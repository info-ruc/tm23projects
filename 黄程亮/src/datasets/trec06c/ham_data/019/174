Hi Skye,

I play in this time also with voice recognicition chips (and voice record +
playback
also for my rug warrior like bot) and I found two of them very interesting:
the first
is the MSM6679A-110 manufactured by OKI. This is a very large chip with 84
Pins
(PLCC) but he includes voice record and playback also and is relatively
difficult to
program. The second one is the HM2007 manufactured by HMC (this is Hualon
Microelectronics in Taiwan), this is a very simple chip but very good for
robotics.
Check out the following sites also, they are very interesting:

Cheers Erwin
