Assuming you mean R/C model servos, take a look at the Futaba servos for
sail boat winches.

Stock 
Number       Description             Torque     Speed  Weight  Dimensions  
FUTM0099  S5801 Sail Winch  136.0 oz.  .5/turn  2.9 oz.  1.81 x 0.98 x 1.73
in. 

Looking at the spec sheet for speed (taken from  Futaba's web site) it says
.5seconds per turn. You might want to call your local hobby store and
verify what that actually means. I haven't seen or used one before.

or take a look at this page I wrote up awhile back to modify a servo for
360 rotation
