This question has nothing to do with the Handy Board
although it is a general question which I need some
help with.

Previous students at the school I attend left behind=20
a robot which they worked on. The microcontroller was
Intel's 80C196. The microcontroller is shot however,=20
so we need to get a replacement. It is offered in both
16 and 20 MHz versions. The original used in the robot
was the 16 MHz version, however we can only find the=20
20 MHz version now.

If I was to replace the 16 MHz controller with a=20
20 MHz version would it affect any of the programming?
What would some effects be if any?

Maybe direct help some of you big microcontroller=20
gurus would be best. (Fred, Randy,... hint,hint)  :)

Thanks in advance,
