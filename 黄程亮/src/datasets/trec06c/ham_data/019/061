Luc,

it sounds like its not downloading at all.  make sure the port you are using
is not disconnected internally, such as when you are trying to use com2 and
the internal modem is configured to use com2, usually com2 port is
disconnected for external use.  it sounds like the problem i was having, and
this is what was wrong.  i ended up having to use com1 which is used by the
mouse, and having to keep disconnecting the mouse when i wanted to download
and reconnecting it when i want to use the mouse.  a hassle, but the only way
that i can get mine to work without download problems.  dont forget to
configure "dl.exe" and "ic.exe" to use com1.  in this case however, since com1
is configured to run with the mouse, you have to "restart the computer in MS-
DOS mode" in the shutdown menu.  this is the dos that you must use.  when you
want to go back to windows, type "exit" and wait a minute.  a good text editor
is found by typing "edit" at the prompt, so once you get to programming, you
will not have to go to windows for a text editor.  you will know if it is
downloading for sure if the green light on the HB blinks very fast, and almost
looks like it is ON.  if this is not happening, then you are not downloading,
no matter what the program says.  let me know how it turns out.
