Hi,

you could simply build and Acknowledge routine so that every character sent
by the PC could be echoed back by the HandyBoard. It asks a bit more of
processing time from the HandyBoard, but at least it's simple to build :)

ex:
PC sends 0x56
HB sends back 0xFF then 0x56
(here 0xFF could tell the computer that this is an echoed character)

Or you could lookup how to build a CRC correction scheme and build a kind
of packet with the CRC byte at the end, which would save a lot of
transmission time, but more processing time for the HB.
