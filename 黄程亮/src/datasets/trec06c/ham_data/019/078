Hello,

Thanks again for the help, but still i have problems getting the HB to talk
to me.
The com ports work, as the download led lights, and the boards does act
different after a download.
Could it be that the RAM is brooken and gives these erratic results ?
Hope to get the thingy talking without returning it to the states.
