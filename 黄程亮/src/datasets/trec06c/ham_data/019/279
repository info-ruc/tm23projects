Hello all,
I have also had this problem and would be interested in any resolution.
However, on another note has anyone had luck or intruction on how to you
the serial code here :

ml
I am not sure how this works and any information would be greatly
appreciated.

Thanks
Michael

Hi,

you could simply build and Acknowledge routine so that every character sent
by the PC could be echoed back by the HandyBoard. It asks a bit more of
processing time from the HandyBoard, but at least it's simple to build :)

ex:
PC sends 0x56
HB sends back 0xFF then 0x56
(here 0xFF could tell the computer that this is an echoed character)

Or you could lookup how to build a CRC correction scheme and build a kind
of packet with the CRC byte at the end, which would save a lot of
transmission time, but more processing time for the HB.
