Hi.  I was reading through a compilation of emails from the Handy Board 
Q&A and found a lot of great questions, but no answers to them.  I am 
trying to power some steppers, microsteppers from the RobotStore catalog, 
with the HB and am not having much luck.  The motors have two coils, four 
wires.  I'm trying to power them by putting one coil in motor 1 (pin slots 1 
and 3) and the other in motor 2 (pin slots 4 and 6).  In the IC program 
I'm turning motor 1 on and then off, then turning motor 2 on and then 
off.  It "steps," but the steps are very sparatic (not uniform in 
radians) and frequently reverse direction for no apparent reason.  PLEASE 
let me know of anything that could help.  

THANX
