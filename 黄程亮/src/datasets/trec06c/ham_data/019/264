Hello all,

I'm currently trying to communicate between the Handy Board and a PC (i486) 
using the existing serial line between the two. Sending data from the handy 
Board to the PC is no problem. An interrupt handler puts all incoming serial 
data into a buffer, which the main program can read from.

Sending data from the PC to the Handy Board is another story. The serial 
routines on http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html work
fine if 
the PC isn't sending very fast. The current 'solution' is to put the PC in a 
short loop after it has sent a character to slow it down. But that's not a
very 
elegant solution.

Is there a way to use the same technique on the handy Board as on the PC
(using 
an interrupt handler)? If so, has anyone used that approach and is willing to 
share this code?

If there is a simpler way of doing things, I would also be glad to know about 
it.
