Hi there, I am having some strange downloading problems.  I have had my 
handyboard working in the past but cannot get ti to work now.  I am using 
a macintosh with the lastest version of the mac downloader.  The first 
segment of the downloading goes fine and the second stage where it loads 
 the pcode to the handyboard almost completes.  The downloading gets to 
7360 bytes instead of something like 7500.  An error message comes up and 
says that the bytes programmed does not match the bytes sent and to check 
the power on the board because low power conditions can cause memory 
errors.  I have checked through the board quite carefully.  The only 
things that I think could be wrong are that the voltage at pin 28 of the 
memory chip is 5.2 volts.  Is this a problem? 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks
