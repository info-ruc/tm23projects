Dear WholeSun folks,

Unfortunately, as many of you no doubt have now heard,
contact with the SOHO spacecraft was lost on June 26.
(see http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/pr26june.html for
details.)  Although a retrieval of contact is still
possible and being actively sought, it seems likely 
that the WSM2 campaign in August, 1998, will be affected.
There are three likely possibilities: 1) SOHO is
retrieved soon, and WSM2 will go on as planned.  2)
SOHO is retrieved in the future, but too late for
an August WSM2 campaign, in which case we will probably 
try to reschedule.  3) SOHO is not retrieved, in which 
case we will run a limited campaign involving 
studies that can still achieve their scientific goals.  

Specifically, JOP 81, the magnetic field structure study -

http://sohops.gsfc.nasa.gov/whole_sun/HOMEPAGE/WSM2/MAGJOP/magjop.html

can be run in conjunction with JOP 84, the coronal active region 
study -

http://diapason.space.lockheed.com/~alexande/WSM_II/JOP.html

using Kitt Peak, Sac Peak, Mees, OVRO, Yohkoh, Canarias and 
Trace observations.  We would not have MDI, EIT, or CDS data, but 
these were not absolutely essential for reaching the goals of those
two JOPs.

Ground based coronagraph observations will continue
to be taken, including Mauna Loa and Sac Peak, which were 
used in the WSM1 campaign:  these along with special
off-pointing Yohkoh observations would allow an analysis 
along the lines of the JOP 76 streamer study -

Also, IPS observations can go on as planned involving
Ooty, EISCAT, and Nagoya

http://sohops.gsfc.nasa.gov/whole_sun/HOMEPAGE/WSM2/WINDJOP/windjop.html

and of course in situ solar wind observations will continue
to be taken.

If there are any questions or suggestions for how best to
deal with this unfortunate turn of events, please contact
gibson@thalia.gsfc.nasa.gov and/or doug@ajcannon.nascom.nasa.gov.
Updates to the WSM2 plans will be posted at
