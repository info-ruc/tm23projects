Subject: USA Today Media Lab story, 6/29/98

Hi all,

Those of you in the States might have caught today's issue of 
USA Today, which has a cover story on the Media Lab's research, 
including a photo of yours truly and a few paragraphs about the
LEGO Mindstorms Robotics Invention System.

there's a web link at  http://www.usatoday.com/news/acovmon.htm .
see also http://www.usatoday.com/news/nds32.htm for the blurb
about my stuff.

anyway, it's pretty exciting, and thought some of you might be
interested :-).

Fred
