	I am selling the Handy Board that I have because it is not fast 
enough for the application that I wanted to use it for.  I am involved in 
decoding highly compressed sound files in a stand alone unit and the 6811 
just can not hack the speed.  I have the Handy Board including the nicad 
battery back, the serial/interface charger board, power adapter serial cable 
connection and telephone cable all in a nice padded case ready for travel.  I 
also have the IC software along with the manuals.  All of this is available 
for $250.  Everything is brand new.  If you are interested please mail me.
