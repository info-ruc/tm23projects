Hello,	
	I've been having some problems using my HandyBoard to talk directly to my
PC via the serial interface.  I disable Interactive C and then Poke() and
Peek() as has been described on this list.  I  send short character strings
from my PC to the HandyBoard under Windows 95.  If I send strings longer
than 2 characters, it seems that some of the characters get lost. This
behavior seems to be affected by repositioning or slightly modifying the
code, suggesting perhaps a timing issue.
 
Why might this be?  Is there any way to check for an error situation?

Thanks for any help,
		Aaron
