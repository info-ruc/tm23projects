Subject: Sony IR Encoding Question - Sources
Message-Id: <Pine.GUL.3.96.980630094635.16905A-100000@coho.halcyon.com>

Does anyone know if there is a chip or software to allow the creation of
Sony Encoded IR signals.  

Since there IS software to decode Sony IR, I would like to be able to
generate, via computer, this Sony IR rather than using a Remote Control
device.

Any help would be appreciated.
