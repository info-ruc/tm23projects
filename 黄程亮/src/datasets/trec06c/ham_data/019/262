Hi, I trying to make a home page about interfacing handy board with
stepper motors, I hope it has enought quality to add a little contibution
to the handyboard effort.

 For now I has just two part :

	One is just mails I found in the mail archive about stepper motors
	http://laguna.fmedic.unam.mx/~daniel/handy_mail.html
	I will soon update the " Interesting mail list ", it has just one
	mail for now. But you can seach in the file of e-mails that have
	the stepper word in them.

	The second part is just how to get a bipolar motor going with a
	handy-board.
	http://laguna.fmedic.unam.mx/~daniel/handy_bipolar.html
	
	TO DO:

	Write a real program that doesn't use the PMW functions fd() and
	bk (), and poke's to the right ports.
	Make a page for the unipolar stepper motor.
	Find some cookbook diver circuts to attach to the handy-board
	digital outputs.
	Make or buy an expansion board to test it with stepper motors.

All you suggestions and constuctive critics are wellcome.
