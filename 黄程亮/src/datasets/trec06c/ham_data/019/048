from an interrupt code, is it possible to 'JMP' or 'JSR' to a
subroutine(function) written in C code?  what i am trying to do is the
following:  in the TOC4INT interrupt routine, be able to call in a C function.
i know that functions are called subroutines in assembler, but i tried the
following instruction in the interrupt code, and i could not get very far: 
 "JSR   subroutine_function"  
where "function" was the name of the function that i wanted to call.  is there
any way that i may do this, and if so, how do i "# INCLUDE" the code that
holds the C function that i am trying to call?  i never actually got far, the
assemler (as11_ic) did not allow me to compile the .asm code for reason that
it could not find the source of C code that was in the '# INCLUDE' statement,
however, the path was specified correctly.  there must be a way to do this.
thanks in advance.
