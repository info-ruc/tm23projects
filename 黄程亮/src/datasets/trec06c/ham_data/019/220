Hi, does anyone know how to efficiently multiplex 5 seven-segment
displays? What I'm doing now (turn on the segment drive, turn on the
digit drive, turn off everything, repeat) causes rather unacceptable
flicker and has the displays at different intensities.... Please help, I
know that there are ways to effectively multiplex without flicker. The
segments are connected to HC374's at 0x4000 and the digits are at the
lower 5 bits of 0x5000. Thanks!!
