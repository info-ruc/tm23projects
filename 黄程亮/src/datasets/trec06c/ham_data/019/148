I'm wondering how the servos are controlled on a walking robot.  

I would imagine that multiple legs would have to be moved simultaneously and 
in sync with each other.  If servos are changed one-at-a-time then one leg 
would be dragging the others.  A design that can control multiple servos but 
only by changing them one-at-a-time seems like one that is not suited for 
walking robots. 

What kind of a controller would be used to manage this?  Have I overlooked 
something?
