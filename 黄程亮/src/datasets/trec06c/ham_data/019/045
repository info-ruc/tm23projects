A while back a few people pointed me to an text about using stepper motor=
s with the handy board.=20
http://www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm=20

To the people who have told me about this, or have used this method to co=
ntrol steppers: please tell me how well you have gotten your motors worki=
ng. I have tried the sample code and my motors are a little sketchy. When=
 they first power up, they jerk left or right a little, causing my robot =
to align incorrectly. Also on the turns they sometimes jerk a little caus=
ing my turns to be thrown off.

...all stepper people *HELP ME* !=20

Thanks in advance,
