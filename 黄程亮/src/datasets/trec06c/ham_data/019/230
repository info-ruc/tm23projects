There are plenty of seven seg driver chips out there that you can connect to
the HB. Look some up on the web (data sheets are all over the place! try a
search engine). I have experience with a nice chip that drives four seven
segs with serial input, thus saving on I/O from the HB. It is the Motorola
MC14499P.

hope this is helpful,
