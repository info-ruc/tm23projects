A few weeks back I was a little dissapointed in the performance of the QT=
 refective optosensors which come with the Handy Board because when using=
 them on the digital inputs, their range was only 1/4 to 1/2 inch or less.

Some people told me to use the Radio Shack type Infrared modules. This wa=
s something I really frowned upon because I needed 5 sets of sensors, so =
this would add up to alot of space.

If anyone is interested in using sensors on the digital inputs here's a w=
ay to get a range of 3 to 3 1/2 inches, as opposed to 1/4 inch.

-----

I constructed my own sensor/emitter pairs from the following two Digikey =
parts:

L14N2QT-ND  Infrared photo transistor
LN66-ND     Infrared LED

The transistor is a 3 legged version so I removed the Base leg. Although =
if you keep it on, you can attach a potentiometer to it and vary the sens=
itivity of the sensor.  (something I havent played with yet)

*also please note the emitter and collector legs are swapped, the emitter=
 is the leg with the tab on the outside of the can.

The wiring is straight forward. I used the same approach shown in the Han=
dy Board manual. The emitter was grounded, collector was wired to the sig=
nal input, and the LED was limited with a 330 ohm resistor.

----

Anything within 3 to 3 1/2 inches gives a true result (0), everything els=
e give a false (1). The numbers are swapped but it works.  :)


Hope someone finds this useful.
