Pleas ere-read the answer. If i have a programa sending data to the serial
com port, nobody can open that port to log into a file! What he want is some
to do that (two programs reading the sam port).
I search some like that, and found a shareware package called: comtap. It
allow to build a wire between you serial port and the device to be atachhed
to the serial port, and monitor all tha activity. If you want that pealse
e-mail me.
