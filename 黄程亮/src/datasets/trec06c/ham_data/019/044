I am trying to transfer large amount of data to a computer from the Handy
Board as it collects that data from the sensors connected to it. I have a
choice of either a windows or a unix machine. I was wondering if anyone
has used the Handy Board for that and if so what is the optimal way to
run the transfer. My goal is to save that data in a file for later use.

Thanx in advance
