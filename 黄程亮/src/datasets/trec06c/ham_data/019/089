If you haven't had enough of football yet here's one for
your robots. No entry fee, no registration just turn up on
the day. Unfortunately the size restriction of 6cms dia
tends to exclude the Handyboard but may be worth a look
anyway. Here is the url:

Regards to all and best wishes to all the people in Northern
Ireland on this momentous day.
