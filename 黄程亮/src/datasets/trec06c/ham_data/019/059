If I'm not confused, I remeber seeing an article on pyroelectric sensors
in the new magazine "Robot Science & Technology" (Someone please verify).
It is still only up to it's premier issue so you can probably still
request it.
http://www.robotmag.com/index.html
Even if the article I remember is not in this issue, it would be great to
look into this magazine anyway.  The magazine is targeted to "educational
and hobby" robotics...people like us.  Maybe it would suit you.
