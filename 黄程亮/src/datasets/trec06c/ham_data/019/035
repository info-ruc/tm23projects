Hi!

    I am now modifying my old r/c truck to control it
with the handyboard, but I want a circuit that will
enable the receiver to control the servos when there
is an output received from the radio control and to
enable the handyboard to control when not output
is detected from the receiver.

    I will then be able to control the r/c truck in case
my programs are not well tune...

    I do have an idea how to do so, but I am wondering
where can I trigger in the receiver to know if there is
a reception of a command or not to enable/desable?

    If any of you have a plan of a futaba receiver, please
contact me.

Thanks!

Sebastien Verreault
