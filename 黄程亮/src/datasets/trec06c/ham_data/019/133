Hi

Replacing the 16MHz version with the 20 Mhz CPU would affect only the
timer speed of the internal timers.
We are using the MC and MD versoon of the 196.
Connected to those timers are about the following :

-PWM 1 & 2
-Wavegenerator (if it has one)
- timer unit (capture and compare unit)
- counters
- serial interface (UARTS)

Maybe there is more, but at this time a can't think of any.

What your main problem will be if using motion control is that your pwm
will run at a 25% higher speed and the time critical stuff relaying on
the timer structure. Further any real tme interrupts will run 25%
faster.  Speed measurement using the timers will go wrong by 25%.

You may have to change all the above to be sure your system doesn't do
strange things.

Hope this helps a little.

BYE  Tom
