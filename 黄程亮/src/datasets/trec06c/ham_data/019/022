Thanks,

Thanks to your suggestions, I was finally able to get the bootloader
downloaded to my 2 handyboards.  What I ended up having to do was use
the DL.EXE program in full-screen mode.
I've had no trouble using the Windows95 version of IC (v3.1) to get my
code into the board since.

The thing that bothers me is I have no idea why I had to use DL in
full-screen to make the download work.  Even using this approach, one of
my boards was still very "squirrelly" and I had to play around with it
to make it happen.  I can attribute the squirelliness of the one board
to potential hardware trouble, but I'm still confused as to the
differences between HBDL, DLM, and DL.  Is it possible to get a hold of
the source code for these apps?

Thanks,
