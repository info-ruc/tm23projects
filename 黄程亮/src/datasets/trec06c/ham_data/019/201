Subject: PCODE Modification for Larger LCD - Question
Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.01a)

I have a nice little box that I got surplus that has a 8x40 LCD with a nice 
keyboard.  I'd like to use one of my handyboards to control that box (tossing 
out the Z80 equiv board; don't have ability to reprogram the EPROM).

Am I correct that I only need modify the 'pcode.asm' file and recompile to 
pcode_hb.s19, to get the larger display to become functional using IC?  

The display that I have is controlled by a Toshiba T6963C LCD controller.  If 
anyone knows where a version of pcode_hb.s19 exists, for that display, I'd like 
to know about it.  No use reinventing the wheel.
