Is the ir emitter on the handyboard just a standard red led? Is it efficient at
emitting in the IR range. Are there better emitters? I want to build an emitter
and detector set and have studied the multiplexing circuit posted. It uses the
same LED. The circuit doesn't give a part number for the Sharp detector. Does
some one know what it is, what are some of the other detectors that can be
used.
