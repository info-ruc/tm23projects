Subject: Cirrus Servos - Question - How do they rate compared to Futaba
Priority: normal
X-Mailer: Pegasus Mail for Win32 (v3.01a)


I have a Cirrus Cs-20 BB Sub-Micro Servo that I have been using for testing.  I 
was wondering how this servo compares to others like Futuba and others.  
Since I know how this one behaves, I can use that info as a comparrison.

What Futuba mode is closest to this one? (11 oz-in at 4.8v)

Are there any dasheets for Futaba or Cirrus on the web?

Thanks
