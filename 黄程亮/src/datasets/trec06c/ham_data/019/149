Mike,
	I have mentioned before that I am going to use a Novasoft MSCC11 board
with an HC811E2 (which has 8K EEPROM on board) and a piece of software
called Robobug which uses all 16 of the i/o pins to control 16 servos.
These servos are all controlled at the same time, I would have to
re-read the info to tell you how but it appears to work. Email me if you
want any more info and I'll dig it out (along with a copy of the
software and documentation if you want it.
