Subject: connecting flash to 68hc11F1
X-Sun-Charset: US-ASCII

Hello all,

I'm using th e68hc11F1 micro and want to connect an AM29f010 flash to it.
I'm configured in a way that i first have 32 K ram and the 32K flash.

I'm not sure how to connect the ~OE (low aactive) ~CE and ~WE. to any of the rw chip select lines of the 68hc11.

I'm running on 16 Mhz.

I'v tried some things but i don't seem to get it running.

The ram works fine, but when trying to program the flash it doesn't
work.

Has anybody done this before or have some schematics.

Thanks

Richard
Software engineer.
