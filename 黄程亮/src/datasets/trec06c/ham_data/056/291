Hi.   I would like to find out more about outputting a signal from DMDX to
trigger another device.  Hardware is not my strong point so if this is a
bit garbled I'm sorry.


In the TimeDX help files it says

>
Assuming you have some test hardware and can monitor the output of PORT C
clicking on the output controls changes the state of that output bit,
checked being LOW.
>

With the keyword Output does the N refer to the pin in Port C that the
signal is sent to?  Does <Output 1> send a signal to pc1, i.e. pin 28?  Is
it a 5 volt pulse?  

We need to trigger an external computer to play sound, as part of out fMRI
set up.  How would I use this in a script?  

0 <o 1> "Start of experiment";

Thanks

- Mike
