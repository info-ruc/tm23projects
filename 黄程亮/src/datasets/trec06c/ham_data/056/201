Hi

Did somebody ever try to connect the Handy-Board to a Hewlett Packard 
48G or 48GX? I don't exactly know the specifications of the serial 
port of the 48G. But there are several serial options possible. For 
example the protocol can be Kermit or XModem, the format ASCII or 
Binary and the baud rate can be chosen between 1200 and 9600. 
So I think it should be possible.

Thanks a lot

Martin
