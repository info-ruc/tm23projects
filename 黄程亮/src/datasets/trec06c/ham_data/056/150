NetMarket (www.netmarket.com) carries a transmit/receive pair made
by Recoton.  It's intended to transmit audio/video around the house.
Ours includes a gizmo to extend your remote control capabilities, and
it cost about $120.  Just the transmitter/receiver pair can be had for
under $100, I believe.
