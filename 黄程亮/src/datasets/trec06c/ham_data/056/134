	JDR Microdevices (http://www.jdr.com) sells a $25 short-range VHF
TV transmitter kit.  It's all analog, so there is some drift with warmup and
it needs a very stable power supply, but otherwise it works great.  The
observer robot in our Egg Hunt contest, Cambot, is equipped with one.  It
broadcasts on Channel 4 to a widescreen TV; the spectators love it.

	It *is* a kit, so you need to solder about 20 components to the
single-sided board.  It has full schematics and troubleshooting, etc.
