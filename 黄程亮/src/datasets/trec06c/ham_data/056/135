Subject: mixing variable types in IC
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Now that I got past my nested function problem I have discovered that IC does not like mixing variable types.  For instance, this results in an error:

int x, y;
float c;

float
divide ( int x, int y)
{
	c = (x/y);
	return c;
}

IC will not let me calculate a float from two integers although it is a perfectly reasonable mathematical operation.  It complains about float/int incompatiblity.  The only solution this hapless programmer can find is to just give in and make everything float.  But that is a big waste of resources when x and y are truly integers.

Must be a more elegant way to do this.  Damned if I know what it is.

TIA

John
