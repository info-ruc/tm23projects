I't not that cheap, but if you want small size and low power consumption
check out this 900 Mhz transmitter/receiver pair from supercircuits:

  http://208.21.248.173/servlet/cat/product/AVX900R2.html

And here's a very small camera with transmitter built in:

Or if you want to receive on a televsion you can go 434 Mhz ATV:

They also have some 2.4 Ghz systems that do both audio and video and 
support simultaneous transmission over multiple channels. I have tried
all of the above and they are working well.
