Kalyan,

Both Marvin Green and Dennis Clark have IRPD kits (fairly cheap) that
IMO are much better than the Lynxmotion unit (I have all three).

   http://www.rdrop.com/~marvin/other/otherprj.htm
   http://www.verinet.com/~dlc/projects/botproj.htm

If you get either Marvin's or Dennis' IRPD kit, I can send you PIC
source code for either board that will greatly improve the noise
rejection.

Good luck and have fun,
 - Nick -
