Hi,

I am here struggling to connect the handyboard with my computer. I am trying
download  pcode.hb.s19
In com1 port, but i am receiving a message that it can't open the port.

I think that the settings of my com1 port is wrong. They are:

Band rate = 9600
Data base = 8
Parity= none
Stop bits =1

Base  I/O port adress 3f8
Interrupted request line 15
X  Fifo Enable.
Or maybe the windows nt is not recognizing the hardware serial port but i don't
know how can i do to make it recognized

Please, if  anyone knows what is going on with my port, please send me a tip, i
will be grateful. The plataform is NT.

Thanks,
