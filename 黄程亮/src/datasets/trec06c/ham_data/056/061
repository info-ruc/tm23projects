	A friend of mine of mine wrote a Ph.D. thesis describing a
the use of fuzzy logic to improve the behavior of an OCR system
capable of recognizing handwritten text. The idea was
to write a prototype Pascal compiler capable of getting handwritten
code. Of course, this works with a limited dictionary, such as the
set of reserved words in Pascal.

	The recognition rate increased dramatically over the result 
of the pure OCR, done with a neural network.

	You can contact him by email if you are interested.
His name is Javier Echanobe, and his email address is 
javi@we.lc.ehu.es.
