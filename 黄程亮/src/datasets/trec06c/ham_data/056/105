Thanks for all the helpful device but the darned thing still does not work.  I have created a simplified program to try to figure out what I am doing wrong.  Here it is:

/* A simplified program to figure out what is wrong */

long time;

void start()
{
       phony();

       void phony()			/*  Line 9 syntax error is reported here */
       {
       		while (digital(2) == 1)
                      		{
			 time = mseconds();              
			}
       }
}

When I try to load it with IC I get a syntax error on line 9.  Can anyone tell me why?

TIA
