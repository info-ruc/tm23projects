dear all,

I am having a problem using the input type keywords with multiple
responses, wonder if anyone could advise me on this.

my expt design, its an identification task which involves displaying movie
files of someone saying some chinese words, and subjects are required to
idenify that particular word from the 6 words given on the screen. those
words are lablled 1,2,3,4,5,6 with corresponding key inputs:  "A" = 1 , "D"
=2 , "G" =3, "J" =4 , "L", " ' " on the keyboard

commands that i put in :

<ep> f100  m110 <s 10> <t 3500> <id "keyboard"> <n 12> <mpr "+A"> <mpr "+D">
<mpr "+G"> <mpr "+J"> <mpr "+L"> <mpr "+'">
$<vm 640,480,480,24,0> <zil 6> <zek > <ztr > <!safemode 1> <azk> <eop>

My questions are:

1. i'm having difficulties recording subjects' responses.. i tried with the
typed responses  <ztr> command, but doesn't seem to work..no responses were
recorded ,  the result file looks as follows (the answer should be key "A")
,
<<

  For a start, key bindings will have to go after any zillion mode
specifications.  Also, specifying <azk> after <zil> is probably going to
screw things up royally, best case would be that it simply cancels <zil>.
My guess is that you want to use the zillion one response mode, <zor>.  In
addition you will have to specify which keys are valid zillion responses
with <vzk> to stop key releases from interfering with the recorded data.
Your parameter line should become something like the following:

<ep> f100  m110 <s 10> <t 3500> <id "keyboard"> <n 12> 
$<vm 640,480,480,24,0> <zil> <zor> <!safemode 1> 
<vzk "+A"> <vzk "+D">
<vzk "+G"> <vzk "+J"> <vzk "+L"> <vzk "+'">
<mpr "+A"> <mpr "+D">
<mpr "+G"> <mpr "+J"> <mpr "+L"> <mpr "+'">
<eop>

Subject 4, 11/09/1999 17:38:20 on avlaptop, refresh 16.63ms
  Item    RT
!  "to" frame 80 beyond end of A_fu1a.mov, resetting to 69
!  Played 68 frames of 68 in A_fu1a.mov

2. is that possible to have feedback for a design like this!?  eg. have
<mpr "+D"> <mpr "-G"> on one trial, and <mpr "-D"> <mpr "+G">  commands
design for separate trials!?
>>

  The + and - refer to whether the response is taken as the key is hit or
as it is released.  It is possible to have feedback, I assume by your
question though that what you want to have is one of you six buttons
correct depending upon the item.  The neat way to do that is with macros
and by having a macro for each response condition that remaps keys to
correct and incorrect responses as in the following:

<ep> f100  m110 <s 10> <t 3500> <id "keyboard"> <n 12> 
$<vm 640,480,480,24,0> <zil> <zor> <!safemode 1>
<vzk "+A"> <vzk "+D">
<vzk "+G"> <vzk "+J"> <vzk "+L"> <vzk "+'"> <eop>

c;

+1 ~' "button ' is the correct key" * ;
