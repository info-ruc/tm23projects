	You have the definition of phony() nested inside the definition
of start().  I don't know what ANSI C and/or C++ let you do, but this is
invalid IC.  You need something like:

long time;

void start()
{
	phony();
}

void phony()
{
	while (digital(2)==1)
	{
		time = mseconds();
	}
}

Of course, somewhere you will need a main() to call start().
