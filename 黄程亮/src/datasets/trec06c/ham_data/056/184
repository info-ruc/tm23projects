Hi.  Can anyone help me with the following.  I have been asked to write a
script that does the following.


8 800ms words played one after another, with a visual display of a number
every 750ms displayed for 500ms.  That is, two independent timings.  


I have one solution, that i am not happy with which involves a lot of
arithmetic, working out the display times relative to the length of the
sound files...


<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><bigger>+200 <<wav 2>"actor" <<svp start>
/  <<ms% 500> "1" /  <<ms% 250> /  <<ms% 50> "2" / <<wav 2>"actor" <<svp start>  / <<ms% 450> "2" /   <<ms% 250> / <<ms% 100> "3"


</bigger></fontfamily>The first 800ms involves 500ms of "1", 250ms empty frame and the first 50ms of the next number, "2", then the sound file cueing the remaining 450ms of the number etc.  I could use %N to keep the item on the screen as the next sound file played but I am not sure that would gain me much, would it?


Thanks for any help.
