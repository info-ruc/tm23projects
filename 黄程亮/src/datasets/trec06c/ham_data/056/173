> Hi, is there a way to evaluate inverse cosine and sine using IC? Thx

The most efficient way to do it is to use Taylor Series approximations of=
 the functions.  Decide how much precision you need, and then write funct=
ions that evaluate the first few terms in the appropriate series.

Usually, a series will converge quite rapidly, and only half a dozen or s=
o terms are needed.  For example, if the sixth term in the series is on t=
he order of 1.0E-6, then you're getting close to the limit of single-prec=
ision arithmetic anyway (and certainly close enough for horse shoes, hand=
 grenades, and tactical nuclear weapons).
