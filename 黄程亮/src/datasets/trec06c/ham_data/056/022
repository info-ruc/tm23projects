there will be a problem sending email larger than 64k whether
utf or not if you don't
	chmod 777 /mail/tmp
so that upas can drop the remainder of larger messages there.
after that, you can send and receive megabytes happily, until you get the phone bill.
the only restriction (i think) is that the header must fit in the first
64k.  that's usually not a problem even with chatty rfc822+mime.
