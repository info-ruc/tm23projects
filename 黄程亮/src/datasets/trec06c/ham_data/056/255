Hi

Ive been having problems with my batteries for my handyboard lately so I
took them out to check them all.
All the batteries checked out fine except for one, which had something very
wrong with it - the terminals were reversed!  So when I measured it with my
multi-tester it read -1.27 volts.
Is this because I may have inserted it incorrectly before, or is it
something else? Any Suggestions?

Thanks
Ross
