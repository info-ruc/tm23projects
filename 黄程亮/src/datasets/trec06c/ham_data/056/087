Dear Sir. 

I am Barrister Abbas Duruh(Esq.), a Senegalese Solicitor & Financial
Attorney/Consultant.I decided to send this first letter write through
email while subsequent ones would be secured. I was the personal attorney 
to late Mr. Essam Panak a foriegn contractor who died among many others
in a car accident along Sicap Express Road in Dakar Senegal. 

Before his death, he was an expatriate mining consultant and Gold/diamond 
machant within West Africa sub-region. Mr. Essam Panak here-in-after
referred as my client was also a category "A"contractor for Senegalaise
National Petroleum Corporation .He satisfactorily executed some contracts 
for Senegalaise National Petroleum Corporation and the sum of
Twenty million United States of American Dollars is an outstanding debt owe to 
him by the Corporation. Unfortunetely, it is after his death that
Contract Award & Suppervisory Committee of the Petroleum Corporation
approved this payment and sent notification to my chambers in accordance
with my client's instructions-that any correspondence in respect to his
dealings with the Petroleum Corporation must go through my chambers. 

The Petroleum Corporation has consequently asked me to contact his next
of kin to claim this outstanding contract fee owe to him. All attempts to 
trace his next of kin(s), even through search in the internet, were
fruitless. I also discovered that my client did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents with the Oil industry. I have 
contacted you to assist in claiming this money from the oil corporation
for benefit of two of us before it is confisicated or declared
unserviceable as warned by the petroleum corporation. This claim would
not be suspicious since am the authority to nominate my client's next of
kin. I discovered your contact during my tidious search in the internet for a 
legitimate next of kin of my late client. 

Note that this transaction is simple and 100% risk free because I am the
authority to nominate my client's next of kin and secondly, I will
provide legal documentations that will present and authenticate you as
the true next of kin as we intend to claim. I wish to point out that
after the claims, I would want 10% of this money to be shared among some 
charity organizations, while the remaining 90% would be shared equally
between us after deduction of expenses expected to be incured by both
parties in the course of this claim. Most importantly,I would also
require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or
anywhere as you may advice. 

If you are interested, please contact me immediately with your private
details which shall include telephone/fax numbers. Upon your response, I
shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with this
claims. I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest
assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us. It will 
take us about 5(five) day to complete this claim if there is no delays on 
your side. 

Awaiting your urgent reply. 
Thanks & Best Regards

Barrister Abbas Duruh
