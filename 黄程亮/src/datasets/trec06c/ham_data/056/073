I have a General Robotics RB5X  I'd like to sale for $1000, it was just
refurbished by General Robotics a year ago at a costs of $1200.
I know this doesn't have anything to do with Hand Boards but I thought maybe
someone from the mailing list would know a place on the Internet
where I could a tell people about it.
Thanks,
Clancy.
