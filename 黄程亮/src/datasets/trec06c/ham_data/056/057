IBM's jikes Java compiler also tries spelling correction, but its
ideas of proximity have nothing to do with any human's. it's
particularly unfortunate that it doesn't even know about the
Java naming conventions. (not that i necessarily think it should,
it's just that if it's going to try to guess what you meant to type,
it would be better off making educated guesses.)

there's a big difference between correcting simple typos and
more complicated "wrong identifier" errors.

anyway, back to the point: the original questioner might be
interested in "Finding Approximate Matches in Large Lexicons"
by Justin Zobel (jz@cs.rmit.oz.au) and Philip Dart (philip@cs.mu.oz.au),
which was the best paper i found when trying to come up with
decent guesses in a "dict"-like program.

btw, has anyone had better luck than i at getting information
about the CD-ROM version of the OED, with a view to having
a Plan 9/Unix OED "dict"? ever since i read the acme paper
with its "futtock" example, i've been jealous.
