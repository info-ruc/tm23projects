Thanks Dave.

I had, fortunately, success to deal with larger Japanese JIS coded files 
than 64 K bytes with upas system with 64K bytes virtual memory version.  
I put the boddle file to our usual home page
(http://basalt.cias.osakafu-u.ac.jp/plan9/p9index.html), which is written
in UTF-8.  In additon, the libtcs has also been updated.

I noticed, this is my first time, the larger file problem occurred when I 
wrote an introductory article on Plan 9 and tried to send/receive that text 
with a magazine publisher. :-)  The article exceeds 80Kbytes in its file size
with a figure. ^_^
