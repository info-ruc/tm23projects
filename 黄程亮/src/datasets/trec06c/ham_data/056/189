Danny,

Since you imply that your battery does not take any charge at all, it
sounds to me as though your problem is:
(1) fuse F1 is open, or
(2) a cell in your battery pack is open, or
(3) one of the battery wires or its associated PCB land is open.

The charge LEDs light when there is current through them ... and with
the HB power switch off, the only current is the battery charging
current.  Take a look at your HB Tech. Ref. pg 51 (fig. 9.6) and
pg. 52 (fig. 9.8).  

At the upper left corner of the HB, above and between the power 
switch and the speaker, there are two solder pads ... a square one
with a "-" above it (the negative side of the battery) and a round
one with a "+" above it (the positive side of the battery).  Check
for voltage at these pads with the charger plugged in ... if there
is 0V, then F1 is open.  If there is about +10V at those pads
when the charger is plugged in, but 0V without the charger, then
the battery or its wires are bad.

Let us know how it goes.

Good luck,
 - Nick -
