In the Handyboard manual it says when charging in trickle mode you should turn
the Handyboard off, however when I do try and turn the Handyboard off the
charge light on the serial/charger board goes off?  Is the board still being
charged or is there a problem?

The same problem occurs when I charge the Handyboard directly.  If the power
switch is turned on the charge light(LED) is on however when it's turn off the
charge light goes off? What's the problem?

When the batteries are charged should the board be able to run withought an
external power supply?

Any information would be great!!!
