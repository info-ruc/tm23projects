dear all,

I am having a problem using the input type keywords with multiple =
responses, wonder if anyone could advise me on this.

my expt design, its an identification task which involves displaying =
movie
files of someone saying some chinese words, and subjects are required to
idenify that particular word from the 6 words given on the screen. those
words are lablled 1,2,3,4,5,6 with corresponding key inputs:  "A" =3D 1 =
, "D"
=3D2 , "G" =3D3, "J" =3D4 , "L", " ' " on the keyboard

commands that i put in :

<ep> f100  m110 <s 10> <t 3500> <id "keyboard"> <n 12> <mpr "+A"> <mpr =
"+D">
<mpr "+G"> <mpr "+J"> <mpr "+L"> <mpr "+'">
$<vm 640,480,480,24,0> <zil 6> <zek > <ztr > <!safemode 1> <azk> <eop>

My questions are:

1. i'm having difficulties recording subjects' responses.. i tried with =
the
typed responses  <ztr> command, but doesn't seem to work..no responses =
were
recorded ,  the result file looks as follows (the answer should be key =
"A")
,

Subject 4, 11/09/1999 17:38:20 on avlaptop, refresh 16.63ms
  Item    RT
!  "to" frame 80 beyond end of A_fu1a.mov, resetting to 69
!  Played 68 frames of 68 in A_fu1a.mov
   250   1045

2. is that possible to have feedback for a design like this!?  eg. have
<mpr "+D"> <mpr "-G"> on one trial, and <mpr "-D"> <mpr "+G">  commands
design for separate trials!?


If anyone has any helpful hints/advice on this  I would be most
appreciative.

regards,
susanna Lau
