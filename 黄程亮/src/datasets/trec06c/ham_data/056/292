  Look at the docs on the scramble emit code, the backslash.

>>>>i had also come across another weird problem.. in my expt, the items
are run  in a way that the subject has to make a response in order to
proceed to the next item. BUT, its funny that, if the subject did not make
a response or miss the first item, the expt will continue on and proceed to
the next item no matter the subject did or did not make response in the
rest of the expt (but i did not have <cr> in the parameter line). But, this
would not happen if the subject had made a respone in the first item.

  Please turn of HTML in your posts, it causes certain mail clients (mine
for instance) no end of trouble.  My guess is that the code may be getting
tied up because you are using a regular clockon indicator in a digital
video frame.  You may want to try a test item file that doesn't play the
digital video but simply displays a target and see if the response system
works as expected there, otherwise could try using the digital video
clockon inidicator.
