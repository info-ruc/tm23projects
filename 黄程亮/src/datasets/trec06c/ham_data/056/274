did you try the Windows Serial Debug instructions, at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/winindex.html

this will at least tell you if the serial port is working at all.  if you don't
see the "Direct to COM1" setting available in HyperTerminal, then Windows
doesn't believe you have a serial port at all.  this might be a problem in the
System Registry or the CMOS configuration of the machine.
