The Bell-Labs web site seems unable to serve BWK's details, and
I seem to recall that he was responsible for an algorithm to
identify single-character spelling errors and character
transposition.

Can somebody point me in the right direction on this score?
Sorry to abuse this mailing list, but it's the closet I have
to the subject I'm interested in :-(

The URL I can't seem to get access to, by the way, is

	<http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/>

(I hope I got that right :-)  I seem to get a "connection refused".
