Yes, you are right.
I noticed this through to get it work, although I forgot to metion it
in my boddle file.

The problem I had was I could not end the cat_mail() after it must
have done the work.  Then, I put a line at its end to write a dummy 
character ('\n') to the file "/mail/tmp/mtxxxxxx", which solved the 
problem.
However, I don't know why.
