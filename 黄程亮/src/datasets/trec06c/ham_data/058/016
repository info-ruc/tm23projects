  I've just released DMDX 1.1.13 that has a check in it to catch these
non-english language versions of win32 that don't have a device named
"keyboard", hopefully they will now throw an error message prompting the
user to specify whatever the keyboard's name is and to map response keys
for it.  If someone would test this for me with an itemfile that contains
no <id xxx> I'd be obliged.
