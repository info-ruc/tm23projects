1. On the Handyboard website, there are 2 drivers which make ports 5 and 7
digital output ports. I have used one of them to control a servo. I need
another one to be connected to a SN754410NE so that i have a PWM output for a
DC motor.

Does anyone i can get another digital output and how to control its output
signal?

2. i'm using the June 1998 version of Lib_Hb.c. i was looking through it and
could not find any multi-tasking functions except for:

void hog_processor()
{
    poke(0x0a, 0);
}


in the tech manual there is a function called 'start_process( , , )' but it
isn't in the .c file. how do get my program to do multitasking?

3. under the System Interrupt Control section of the same library file, the
comments said we can turn on and off various interrupt routines. it only give s
functions for the PWM and Print screen functions. where can i get the other
functions such as IR Decoding, quad shaft encoding?

please reply soon.
