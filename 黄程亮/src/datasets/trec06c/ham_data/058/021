I have try DMDX 1.1.13 on Chinese win98
and on TimeDX the input device mouse and keyboard were test OK, but their
name are in chinese not english.

The PC detail were 
CPU AMD K2 300MHz
Tradition Chinese Win98 system
DMDX version 1.1.13
Directx 7 english version download from DMDX

The itemfile without <id xxx> used

<ep>f50<VideoMode 800 600 600 16 0> <eop>
=1 "fwdmask" %10 /  "target" %2 /* "make a response"/c;
=2 "fwdmask" %10 / "target" %2 /* "make a response"/c;
0 "Test Mode 1¨ / <testmode 1>/c;
=3 "fwdmask" %10 / "target" %2 /* "make a response"/c;
=4 "fwdmask" %10 / "target" %2 /* "make a response"/c;
0 "end¨ l;

Result:(prompt by an error message box)

"No default KEYBOARD input device found, manual specification of it's name
and reponse key is required"

Also in DMDX syntax check report 
"Input Device <KEYBOARD> selection failed" 



The itemfile with <id xxx> :(jfc the id's name below mean "keyboard" in
Chinese)

<ep> f30  <VideoMode 800 600 600 16 0> <id "Áä½L"> <eop>
=1 "fwdmask" %10 /  "target" %2 /*  "make a response"/c;
=2 "fwdmask" %10 / "target" %2 / * "make a response"/c;
0 "Test Mode 1¨ / <testmode 1>/c;
=3 "fwdmask" %10 / "target" %2 / * "make a response"/c;
=4 "fwdmask" %10 / "target" %2 / * "make a response"/c;
0 "end¨ l;

Result:(no prompt message)

DMDX syntax check no error report
under continu mode (/c) all item were show with message "CORRECT 4000" on
each frame. Without continu mode I can't go on as the keyboard show no
response.
