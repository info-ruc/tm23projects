Subject: archive and/or temperature sensor

Hi,

Hate to bother every one but is there an archive for the
list? I remember a few weeks ago someone talking about
interfacing a temperature sensor to the handyboard.
I wanted to see how that person was going about it.
I'm a software person who did hardware a long time ago
and need as much help as I can get to get started.
Finished building my handyboard over the weekend.

Thanks,
Jim
