Need more information.  What kind of "light" sensors are you referring to?
CdS cels, IR light sensors, active sensors?  There is alot of information
on wiring sensors in the Handyboard manual available in the Documentation
section of the MIT Handyboard website.  I'd suggest looking there first
and see if that answers your questions first.
