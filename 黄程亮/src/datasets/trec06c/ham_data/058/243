I have installed the memory and am on the test where i try to download a =
program and start up the handy board.....  (have it calculate 1+2;)

The pcode and everything install properly but when i cycle the power, i =
get nothing, no beep, and the LCD is just lit up on the top row. =20

I checked that voltage is staying on memory, even when board is off.  =
what can i do? it appears there is a memory problem
