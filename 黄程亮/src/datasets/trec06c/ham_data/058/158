I just added the Sharp IS1U621 to my handyboard. That is apparently a substitute
for the ISU160. When I run the simple test program:

    while (1) {if (4 & peek(0x1000)) fd(0); else bk(0);}

my lights continuously flicker. When I put my logic proble on the output, it is
a continuous pulse. The demodulator does not seem to be working. I also tried a
second part with the same result.

The data sheet for these parts seems to indicate the need for some capacitors on
the supply and output (47uF and 1000pF respectively)

Can anyone give me some ideas?

thanks,

Wayne
