  If you want precise acoustic relative timing I suggest you build single
wave files per item.  The kind of functionality you need was offered in VM,
Voice Master as opposed to Display Master.  It has been left as an orphan
DOS program tied to Mertus' BLISS drviers as alomost no one needs that
level of functionality.
