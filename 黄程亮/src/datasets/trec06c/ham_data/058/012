Hello,
This might be especially relevant to DMDX-users (especially "newcomers" like me)
who are not using the English version of Windows (e.g., I have a German version of
Windows).

At first, when I tried the "tachtest.rtf"-task from the demo files, my computer
kept crashing. Jonathan and Kenneth Forster then told me that the problem might be
solved by specifying keys or mouse buttons for positive / negative Response and
for Request,

<mr +name_of_key_or_button>    request
<mpr +name_of_key_or_button>    positive response
<mnr +name_of_key_or_button>    negative response

Importantly, the names of the keys or buttons have to be exactly like they show in
the TimeDX-input-test. The same holds for the input device, specified by
<id name_of_input_device>
Thus, e.g. if you have a German version of Windows (like in my case), the input
device, key and button names will be in German in the TimeDX-input-test. Then they
also have to be in German in the DMDX control file.

After I entered these lines into the "tachtest.rtf"-file, everything worked just
fine. I'd like to thank Jonathan and Kenneth Forster for their help.

Regards,
Florian
