Dear DMDX users,

I'm a new user trying to design a word-by-word sentence reading experiment
(‘moving window’) giving a reaction time for each keypress that erases a
word and elicits the next. Each word is preceded with a forward mask. The
subject answers a content question about the sentence after it is
displayed. Eventually I will be running these experiments with both English
and Chinese stimuli.

So far I’ve put together something that works (see program below) by using
<x N> and <y N> keywords to put the words and their masks where they should
go, but this takes a lot of time because of the need to figure out
different spacing required by different word lengths. I’ve tried the <px>
keyword, but as far as I can tell if I want a response time for each word,
then each word has to be contained in its own item, and the <px> keyword
has scope over a single item. 

I’ve also seen reference to a Response Contingent <rc [N]> keyword for
experiments like this, the usage of which I can’t figure out. 

Does anyone know of a good way to do this? 

Thanks,

Jerry Packard
