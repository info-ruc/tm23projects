1. Two quick question, when i type 'ps' at the C prompt, i always
get the following:

PID   STAT   PC    SP    ORG   Tricks       Executing
 1    20    c200  fe01   fe00   10        <command line interaction>


is that there becoz Interactive C is running or is that something else?

2. my handyboard already has the TI SN 754410NE H-bridge chip which combines
the attributes of the L293D and L293B. i need to be able to drive about 1.4A
per motor output. is there a chip with that current capacity which can replace
the one i have?

what are my other options? can i put 2 of those chips in parallel to double the
current capacity?


reply soon.
