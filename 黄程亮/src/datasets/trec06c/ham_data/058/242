Hi all,

I have just startded using a Handy Board. In the technical specification it
says "IC compiles into P-code, which is then interpreted by the run-time
machine language"

1. What exactly is p-code. i mean the format etc.?
2. Is C and assembler commands both compiled into p-code?
3. What is, and how is the compiler on the HandyBoard different from IC?

many thanks

M Fazal
