We've been have some serious problems with timings and WAV files. 
Sometimes DMDX clips off the end of the first file in a script as 
below.


(A) +1 <<wav 2> "500ms_file1" / <<wav 2> "50ms_file2" / <<wav 2>
"500ms_file3"/;


(B) This could come out as e.g. 478 ms of file1 then 45 ms of file2 then
483 of file3


We ran a test file like (A) above with each item the same as above and it
seems that there is some kind of pattern to the clipping.

On each running of the script the amount of clipping was the same for
each frame in each item, e.g. like (B).  However, on the next running of
this file you will get a different amount of clipping all the way through
the running of the file, e.g.


run 1 - a,b,c 

run 2 - c,a,b


Where the letters represent milliseconds clipped from files.    


This interacts in some way with frame duration as set in the parameter
line altering the amount clipped although we have not been able to work
out exactly what this is doing.


This would appear to be a <bold>serious</bold> problem as it will degrade
considerably the quality of speech files and make the intertrial
intervals incorrect.
