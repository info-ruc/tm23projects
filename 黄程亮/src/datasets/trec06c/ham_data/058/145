I know that designing your own servo motor is kinda stupid becoz they are
abundant out there. but i'm in a competition which requires us to design our
own gearbox, so i don't see a way out of it.

how do i start? how do i design that feedback loop which will involve a
potentiometer; the gear ratios, etc. please help.
