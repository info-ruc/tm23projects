Hello,
	I'm currently doing a project that requires emitter and receiver, but I
have a problem. For the emitter circuit, pulses is received from the
programmed that I've programmed into the Xilinx, it then sent the pulses to
the emitter and the emitter lights up accordingly, but after a few seconds
the emitter should not light up, as I would like to sent a new set of
pulses. It's the same for the receiver circuit. Thanx for your help.
