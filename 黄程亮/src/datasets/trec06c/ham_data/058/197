Hi guys,

        I built a Hbridge motor driver using the IC 
 L298N.  But it is not working properly.  It is
swithcing properly with the inputs but it is not
drawing the current required for the motor.  I am
sensing the out Voltage as 8v but when i connect the
motor it is dropping to 0v . and the current drawn by
the motor is very less(0.9ma).   I don't know why it
is 
not supplying the current for the motors. 
        i am giving the circuit as a text attachment.
Please help me with this. Logically circuit is working

properly, and it is switching the out voltages
acourding to the inputs but it is not drawing
sufficiant current from the power source and not
suppliing to the motors.
       any help is appreciated.
      thank you,

Robo.
