  No it's not strange, the name of the button (as far as DMDX is
convcerned) includes the + or - symbol.

  You can't use a pio12 input device unless you actually have a PIO-12, if
you do then DMDX will be taking noise as input and so it can see the
request key hit when in fact it isn't.

  Because only those buttons are bound by default, if you wish to use other
buttons you will have to bind them yourself.

  It's the PIO Test that you are talking about, not the Input Test.  You
can't use RawJoystick for anything except a classic joystick that has up to
4 buttons.  If you wish to use the fifth button you will have to use <id
jaystick> and put up with have it take 1.5ms to poll the device (or short
out the potentiometers n the gamepad).  Alternatively you could use
RawJoystick and map +Button 3 to the VOX (which you'd have to do even if
you could get button 4 anyway as it isn't bound by default), <mvk +button 3>.

Trying to be happy is like trying to build a machine for which the only
specification is that it should run noiselessly.
