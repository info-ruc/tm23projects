Here are the minutes of the Thursday, 12/16/99, GSO Meeting.

Summary:

1. The constitution was voted on; all present approved it, but based on the
number of approval votes received at the time of the meeting, three (3)
additional email votes from absent department reps are needed before it is
adopted.

2. Officers and liaison committee members who were elected are: Aimee
Trochio - Vice President; Dave Morgan - Treasurer; Amanda Schermer and
Masako Yamada - Liaison Committee.

Minutes:

Jason Ritt, from the Mathematics Department, moderated the meeting, which
began at 5:45 p.m.

I. The constitution was voted on. It received 12 votes in favor, which
included two votes via email, and none against; it needs three more votes
from absent department representatives before it is passed.

II. Committee chairs for the term beginning in the Spring are: FAR
committee - Nathan Mesnikoff; Healthcare - Robert Pitts (volunteered until
May); Housing & Community - no members; Publicity - no chair; Social
committee - no members.

III. Election of Officers and Liaison Committee Members. Nominated for
office to the GSO were:
1. Aimee Trochio - Vice President
2. Dave Morgan - Treasurer (volunteered until May)
3. Amanda Schermer and Masako Yamada - Liaison Committee

All were elected unanimously. Jason Ritt received one write-in vote for
President, but declined to run for the position. The position of President
therefore remains open.

IV. Constituent Issues.

1. Amanda Schermer raised two issues in two proposals to the GSO.

a. One-time Volunteer Activity for the GSO. Amanda proposed to approach the
administration in order to get a suggestion from them for a one-time
volunteer activity that the GSO might do as a community service project.
This proposal passed unanimously.

b. Graduate Student Representation on Administrative Committees. Amanda
proposed to approach the administration, in particular, Assoc. Dean
Whitaker's office, in order to find out what administrative committees
exist to which the GSO might send graduate student representatives. This
proposal also passed unanimously.

2. Report on Library Privileges. Robert Pitts reported that GRS is still
discussing extended library privileges for all grads with the library and
that some kind of semester-long borrowing period is very likely according
to Assoc. Dean Whitaker's office. The dean is still trying for a Spring
semester change in policy. The GSO's previous (11/18) decision to wait
until next semester before taking further action on this issue was
reaffirmed at this meeting.

3. Patent Policy. Someone stated that they believed that it was the Student
Employment office that sent out the letters concerning BU's patent policy
that some graduate students were required to sign this semester. It was
also noted that some undergraduates were also required to sign the policy.
Masako Yamada proposed to ask the administration about how they intend to
handle the patent policy issue next year and also to express the GSO's
concern about how the issue was handled this year. The proposal passed
unanimously.

4. Housing. A graduate student attending the meeting wanted the GSO to work
towards getting the University to help first-year graduate students obtain
housing. He noted that Rutgers, Harvard and MIT had such services. He
argued that at least temporary help would be useful, say, until the first
of September. He noted that right now new foreign students were given free
housing for about a week, during their orientation, but that they were
kicked out of the dorms on 8/28, while most of them could not move into
their new apartments until 9/1. It was pointed out that the GSO has the
opportunity to work with the administration on this year's orientation, and
that we might be able to pursue the issue further with the administration
in the Spring. The proposal to put the issue on the agenda of the next GSO
meeting was passed unanimously.

5. Travel. Jason Ritt proposed to look into group airline rates for travel
grants for those graduate students attending conferences and other academic
functions. This proposal passed unanimously.

The meeting ended at 7:15 p.m.
