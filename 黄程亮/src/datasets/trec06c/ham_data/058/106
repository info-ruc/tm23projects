Subject: Driving an L298 motor driver board

I'm trying to drive 2 larger DC motors that draw about 1A each.  I am using
a L298 motor driver board that is sold by HVWTech.  I would like to drive it
straight from the Handyboard and I'm wondering if I'm going about this
correctly.

Am I correct in thinking that I can run the signal straight from the motor
in on the l293 socket, straight into the appropriate socket or pin of the
l298 and get the same result ?  I have tried this but have not been
successful.

Anyone interfaced these successfully, and willing to share their expertise?
;)
