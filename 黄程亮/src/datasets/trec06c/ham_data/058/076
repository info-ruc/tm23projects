  The are called Cues and are a standard .WAV file feature however not all
editors may provide support for them, CoolEdit96 (View / Cue List)
certainly does though.  There are technical documents on the web about the
construction of a RIFF file (what a .WAV actually contains), use:

http://www.wotsit.org/search.htm

  And search for RIFF, there's a 47K MS Word document, from there look at
the Cue-Points chunk.
