  As always with the "what is better" question, I must ask...  What do you mean
by "better"?

  They will operate the same, I think they have the same cable pinout.  The
Hitec ones are cheaper usually, but a little larger for the same specs.  At
the low end ($10-$20 range) there is no performance difference.  There are
about 10 companies that make servos.  My only caveats are that the Hobbyco ones
are crap.  The rest seem to be quality products.
