  Looks good to me and the backslash is indeed what you need to use.  What
is the error that occurs on the line afterwards?  Illegal character or
switch perhaps?  My guess is that there are trailing spaces after the
backslash -- in order to stop scramble picking up backslashes in file names
the backslash has to be at the beginning of a line and IIRC have no spaces
after it.  Perhaps you've go some silly RTF stuff going on, you might want
to look at the the raw RTF codes too see what's happening.
