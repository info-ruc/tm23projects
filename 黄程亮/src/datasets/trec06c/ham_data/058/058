I have try the: 
<id "mouse_in_chinese_name_copy_from_timedx"> <mpr "+ Button_0_in
_chinese"> <mnr "+ Button_1_in _chinese">
 
<id rawjoystick> no mr/mpr/mnr require 

<id pio12> no mr/mpr/mnr require 

they all work, as you say the naming of input device must be correspons to
naming provide by TIMEDX input test

It is strange that on <id "mouse_chinese"> the (mr/mpr/mnr) +/- sign should
be include inside the " ", e.g <mpr "+ button_chinese 1"> but not < mpr
+"button_chinese 1">, the syntax check will report error that no mapping
were found on the later case.

and I can't use both <id rawjoystick> and <id pio12>, DMDX will behave
abnormally i.e. RT will be 1 and automatically continu without /c command.

On using the rawjoystick, it is fascinating, without running the TIMEDX, I
insert the parameter <id rawjoystick> and plug in the Gamepad
(logitech-thunderpad), the itemfile run, the default key REQUEST POSREPONSE
NEGRESPONSE all work except VOX. the response of the gamepad make me feel
much more skillful than the mouse button.

I am going to compare the old itemfile that run the chinese word in bmp
under english windows with the new setup with chinese word as RTF under
chinese windows to see if any different...

Last thing I want to ask Joanthan:
About <id rawjoystick> +Switch 4 VOX, on timedx input test VOX is mark N/A 
how can I make the VOX work on <id rawjoystick>, is it some add-on circuit
to connect to the gamepad....?
