I have two HandyBoards.
One is having a severe heating problem on the second from the bottom chip on 
the left side.  It is getting to the point that after a few minutes of being 
on, it is painful to touch.  All of the solder points to that chip appear 
all right to the eye.  If there is something that I can do to correct this 
problem let me know.

The second Handyboard is not being recognized by the computer.  To get into 
boot strap mode, I flick the on switch with "Stop" depressed. The power 
light then does not come on untill i have the board plugged into the 
Interface Board.  I have the Interface board plugged into the modem port and 
have the appropriate software running.  The power is plugged into the 
Interface board because it doesn't work if it is in the HB.  I get endless 
lines of "Synchronizing with board, Board not responding."  My only choice 
to close the program is to force quit it.  If I unplug the Board, it knows 
it is not there.

I have also tried it in the printer port.  The software does not run.  That 
is not so much a concern as long as the modem port works.
