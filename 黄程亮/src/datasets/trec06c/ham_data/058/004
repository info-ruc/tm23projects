Hi.  Has anyone had a problem getting a PCI I/O card working properly.  I
can't seem to get it working.  My intuition is that it is something to do
with setting the base address.  I can't find out how to do that with the
set up software that came with the card.  

The card is Keithley KPCI-PIO24

Thanks

Mike
