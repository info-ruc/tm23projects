We would like to use DMDX to run an experiment in which items within a
block are presented in random order, but the blocks of items are
presented in a fixed order - always the same for each subject. However,
the standard scrambling option re-orders the blocks (as well as
re-ordering the items).


Apparently there was a way to disable the block re-ordering part of the
scrambling code in DMASTR. We found the following in the manual:


--------

A backslash essentially divides the item file into two or more separate
files. Once a backslash is encountered, all the preceding material is
scrambled

and output, and then the material after the initial backslash is treated
as a new input. 


The implication of this option is that one can define segments to be
scrambled in the normal way, except that the segments retain a fixed
serial order relative to each other. So for example, if you had an
experiment with two different tasks, and it was important to make sure
that all the items for one task were presented before all the items on
the second task, then a backslash separating the two phases of the
experiment is required. If this option is not used, then you will find
that items from the second phase will appear in the first, and vice
versa. 

--------


which sounds like what we need to use. But wherever I try and put a
backslash into a DMDX file I get an error on the item after the backslash
and scrambling still seems to pick from either of the blocks.


Is the backslash included in DMDX V1.1.11? If so, what's the syntax that
we need to use to get this working?


I've attached a short sample script underneath.


Many thanks,


Matt
