The 'system_pwm_off' function comes standard with the 'lib_hb.c' file. this
function switches the PWM off for all the motor ports. is it possible to turn
the pwm off for a specific motor port while the others are able to run with
PWM?

        i've a DC motor and stepper motor hooked up to the motor ports. i
used Peter Harrison's stepper motor algorithm (from the handyboard site.
it turns the pwm off for all motors). but i need to use PWM on the DC motor.

i'm open to suggestions.

please reply soon.

thanx
