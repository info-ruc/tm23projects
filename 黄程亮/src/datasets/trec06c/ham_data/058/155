I'm building a robot for the 2000 Trinity College competition.  Since the
goals of the contest are fairly complex and I'm new to programming, does
anyone know of source code listings for a sumo bot?  I've seen a bit of
assembly source but I'm particularly in C (or near C) examples for
reference.  

Thanks!
