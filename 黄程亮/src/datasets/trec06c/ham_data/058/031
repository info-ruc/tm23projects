Has anybody tried self-paced reading with DMDX - or indeed any 
other form of response contingent display?

Versions of this that would work under Dmastr seem to no longer 
operate and indeed I've been unable to get any form of response 
contingency to work with DMDX (without it falling over later in the 
item or on the start of the next one) and wondered if anybody else 
has had success.

Thanks,  Wayne
