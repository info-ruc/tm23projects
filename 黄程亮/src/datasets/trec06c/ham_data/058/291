I want to add an additional character display operated from my HB.  It will be an LED character display larger than the LCD screen and remote from the HB.  I am thinking of doing it with a "Y-cable" from the LCD header so that both can be used with different addressing.

Surely someone else has done this.  Have any code for the additional display function?  

TIA

John
