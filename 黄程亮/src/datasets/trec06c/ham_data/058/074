I've written a script that processes sound files to be used in running a
gating experiment. (For the unitiated, in a gating experiment,
progressively longer sound files are played to subjects who respond with
the word or words that they can hear at each gate).

The script automatically processes .wav files, creating sound files of
increasing duration (e.g. first gate 100msec, second gate 150msec, third
gate 200msec, etc.). The script is fairly flexible so that you can set the
duration of the first gate and the interval between it and subsequent gates
to suit your needs.

Some caveats:

1) The script cuts off speech at the exact number of milliseconds specified
(not looking for zero-crossings). There may be some minor pops and clicks
in the resulting sound files.

2) I couldn't figure out how to work with the cursor specifications that
DMDX uses. So the script creates one soundfile for each gate - this can
take up a lot of disk space. 

You can download the script from here:

Comments and suggestions would be welcomed.

Matt

PS Can anyone point me towards documentation on how cursor positions are
specified in .wav files. That way some future revision to the script could
be written to use cursors rather than creating zillions of sound files.
