Dear colleagues,   
As D.Zonter showed in yesterday's SVD meeting, there were three
moments with extremely high dose rate while the high-emittance run of
KEKB was prepared.  

SVD has suffered radiation 0.2 to 0.4 krad, depending on the radfet
position.  Only F-90 sensor, which is put on Beryllium pipe, suffered
1.3 krad in a few minutes. The F-VA1 sensor which is placed at F-90
position, behind 300 um gold plates, suffered about 0.6 Krad. It seems
that the 300 um gold, together with the slight larger distance from
the beam center could reduce the radiation level by 1/3.  

1) December 2 16:20
   Since the injection to LER was poor, LER movable masks were fully opened.
SVD issued beam abort at LER current of 4 mA.

2) December 5 17:20
   Since the injection to LER was poor, LER movable masks were fully opened.
SVD issued beam abort at LER current of 20 mA.
      
3) December 8 19:58
   When vacuum leakage happened. Beam is aborted by SVD.
   

Graphs were read out by eyes.  
                            Dec.2    Dec.5   Dec.8
           Sensor           16:20    17:20   19:59
F   0 degrees on Be tube     0.6      0.3     0.4
F  90 degrees on Be tube     0.05     0.1     0.1
F 180 degrees on Be tube     0.05     0.1     0.05
F  90 degrees close to VA1   0.1      0.15    0.15
B 180 degrees on Be tube     0.05     0.1     0.1
