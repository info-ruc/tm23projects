Hey Group,
    I'm currently trying to get assembly files to work with my HB, i've
discovered that the exe I need; as11_hb.exe only runs on UNIX, so you have
to use http://www.newtonlabs.com/ic/icb.html to assemble the files, which I
might say is a little inconvenient.
    So, where can I get the source code to the program, and can I use DJGPP
to re-compile it into a dos format?

     Thanks Matt
P.s (Yes I know about the ctrl+m's)
