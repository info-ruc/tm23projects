I am developing a course at SJSU using the handyboard
as the microcontroller for a competition being held at
the end of the semester.

This new course have us build the handyboard from
scratch and go through the debugging process.  

I have help some people go through some of the basic
debugging process, but I would also like to know what
kind of other problem people from the mailing list
have encounter and how it was resolve.

I plan to use these debugging ideas as a manual later
use to help other people debug their board when they
encounter the same problems.

Thank you 
Henry
