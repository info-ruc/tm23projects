I suspect that I fried my memory chip.  The handyboard downloads
Pcode perfectly, but when it tries to synchronize with interactive C, 
I get an error.  While the board is off the 62256-12LP and the 74HC132
chips stay hot. is there a good diagnostic that I can perform to see
whether or not the chip is actually dead?

thanks
