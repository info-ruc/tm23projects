Hi,

There is a GSO meeting this Thursday, October 28, at 5:30-6:45 in MCS
135.  All graduate students in the Graduate School of Arts and
Sciences are welcome to attend.  We'll have FREE PIZZA AND SODA! 

In this meeting we'll:

-Finalize committees.  

If you are interested in serving on a
committee, please come to this meeting, or e-mail
joincommittee@gso.bu.edu.  If e-mailing, please indicate on which
committee you are interested in participating.  For a list and brief
description of the committees, see http://gso.bu.edu.

Most of the work of the GSO is done "in committee," so this is the
best way to get involved!

-Briefly discuss the GSO constitution.  

The GSO constitution is on
the web page at http://gso.bu.edu/Constitution.html.

-Have an open discussion.

If there is an issue you feel the GSO should address, this is your
chance to bring it up.

Once again, there will be FREE PIZZA AND SODA at this meeting.  Be
sure to arrive early to get your "piece of the pie."
