Mostly PWM will get jerkier. If you sit to long in there and the motors
happen to be 'on' then you can go faster than you would like :-)

You also "lose time" in the sense that msleep is no longer accurate so
there are issues with tasks that are waiting a set number of milleseconds
to execute. 

In general, if you are taking too much time in the ISR then either:
	1) You need a faster processor
	2) You need to re-evalutate what you need to do at
	   "interrupt time" vs "user time"
