Hans,

What Christopher Prosserhas stated was correct, and this is exactly 
what Vadim Gerasimov does in his HDBL windows program.

And it is also the technique used in my HB_Buffalo downloader program 
for programming the HandyBoard with a Buffalo type machine code 
monitor. 
http://132.234.46.5/Programs/HBoard/Index.shtml

My downloader was written in Borland Delphi, yet I am familiar 
with Borland-C.  I can thus help if needed.

I would be interested in seeing this project come about.  Keep us 
posted!
