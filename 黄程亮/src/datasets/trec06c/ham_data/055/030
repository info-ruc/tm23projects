Subject: motor current trick
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

I've got a great R/C track vehicle that I want to use as a robot
chassis, problem is the 1 Amp motors. I was going to use Kam's
suggestion, but then I saw the Sonar schematics. I noticed that the
sonar schematics have power coming from the motor outputs in parallel to
increase the current to the sensors range. Can I do that with a motor?
It seems that I could code it so that one call starts two motor outputs
simultaneously, and run the outputs in parallel to get a current pretty
near 1A. That's even simpler than Kam's idea. 

Of course, I'm assuming that since I haven't seen it brought up before,
that it's not a good option, I just like to keep things simple. I don't
want to stress anything, but it seems to me that that would work. Any
ideas?
