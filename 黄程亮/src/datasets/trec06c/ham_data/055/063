I work for ComputerBoards, Inc., a company that makes high quality yet
inexpensive expansion cards for Intel platforms.  We have just about anything
you could need for analog or digital I/O, serial communications, GPIB, and a
variety of other related products.  We cover ISA, PCI, PCMCIA, and a host of
other busses.

Check out our full product line at:

   http://www.computerboards.com

I apologize for pimping my company's wares on this forum, but I truly believe
that if you look around, you'll decide to buy from us.  Our products are better
and cheaper than anyone else's, and we've got the best warranties in the
business.

But I encourage you to decide for yourself.  Our main competitors are companies
like National Instruments, Data Translation, and Keithley Metrabyte.  If you
can find a better product for less from any source, I'd like to hear from you.

Good luck with your project!
