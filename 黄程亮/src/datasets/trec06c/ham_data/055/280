Hi!

I just upgraded the IC 2.81 to 3.2 version and now I can't anymore =
download the needed C libs.

The pcode (version 3.1) will download nicely but when the IC will try to =
download the lib files it will stop everytime in the same position. The =
lib_hb.c, lib_hb.icb and libexpbd.icb will load but expsens.c will give =
a message "Board synchronization error: sent 98, received 12". I do have =
the I/O-expansion board attached. With IC 2.81 version all the files =
would be downloaded and the HB is working properly.

Does anyone have some idea how to proceed to solve this problem? (I have =
sent the error description to newtonlabs but they haven't answered yet).
