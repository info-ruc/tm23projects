Hiya

	To all you mac gurus , recently obtained a rf tx + rx , have succesfully 
interfaced 2 HB remotley , and was wondering if a desktop top could TX data 
to a HB with the RX atached to the RX lines of the  RS 2-32 port.  Meaning : 
I know how to do it hardware whise but how would one go about sending the 
data , A hacked version of IC or a c c++ programm that opens a serial port 
and downloads what typed?

Ideas Suggestions?

Thanx in advance!!
