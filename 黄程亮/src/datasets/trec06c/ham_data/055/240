A new GCC/HC11 port is available.  I had nothing to do with this one,
but it looks much better than the GCC-2.8.1 port that I'm maintaining.
It uses the full GNU toolchain.

	http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html

It is reported to work with the Handyboard, the BotBoard2, and the
Adapt-11 so far.  It also has floating point.  This is just the thing
for you Unix guys out there (you know who you are).  Debugging support
also.

As all of you SHOULD know, it is copyrighted under the GPL license,
which means it costs nothing.

Here's the announcement:

Subject: New snapshot of GCC for 68HC11 

Hello,

A new snapshot of the 68HC11 port for GCC, GDB, Binutils is available.
The port is based on:

  - GCC 2.95.1
  - GDB 4.18
  - Binutils 2.9.1
  - Newlib 1.8.1
  - Dejagnu 1990809
 
This port supports 8,16,32 and 64-bits integers as well as 32 and
64-bits floats. It supports generation of trap and interrupt handlers.
The format of binaries is ELF32 with DWARF-2 for debugging format.

The GCC testsuite gave quite reasonable results as it produced only
1% of failure (86 failures over 7996 tests).

A complete description is available at:

http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/m68hc11_port.html

You can also get the complete port+html files at (752K):

http://home.worldnet.fr/stcarrez/gnu-m68hc11-19991102.tar.gz

You must get GCC, GDB, Binutils and Newlib separately.


regards,
        Stephane
