A couple of easy things that you can do to increase the current
capabilities of the motor drivers are: (1) replace the L293Ds with
SN754410 chips (available from Acroname), and (2) piggyback one
H-bridge chip on top of the other to handle almost double the max
current.  I haven't tried paralleling the motor driver outputs
myself, but I seem to remember it being mentioned on this list
some time ago.

Good luck,
