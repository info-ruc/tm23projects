Yep, I've checked out about every page I've seen on this.  I just haven't
had the time to do it yet. :| As soon as our competition is over and
classes settle down (maybe in 3 years :()) I will get a chance to
experiment with it.
 
When will you be shipping ready with the Handyboards?  Will you be
offering the serial/charging thing too?  I assume you'll be selling the
same thing as acroname?  Thinking of the LCD terminal is quite nice!
 
Thanks,
 
Jim M.
