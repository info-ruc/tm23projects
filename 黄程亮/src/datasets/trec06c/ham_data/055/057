If a motor stalls, it draws a lot of current (compared to normal operation).
You can measure that quite easilyusing dedicated chip, or by measuring the
voltage over a small resistor in series with the motor: if more current is
draw, the voltage drop over the resistor will increase. You will however
lose a little voltage also when the motor is not stalled.

Ps. does anybody know where to get the Polaroid 6500 sonar thing in Holland?
