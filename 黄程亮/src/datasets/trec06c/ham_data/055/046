  Well the code in TimeDX that displays the names of devices is the same
code in DMDX that does a stricmp() so if it can't find a device it's
because the strings don't match.  Either you are missing something cruel
like a trailing space or the item file has some special RTF code that isn't
getting parsed out correctly (which I'd bet is impossible).
