I have to admit that I have not actually finished the project, work
commitments meant that it was shelved for a while. The easiest way to
communicate to the HC11 is to use the software from the HB website that
allows you to use one of the pins on one of the ports (I think it is PA7 but
I'm not sure without looking it up) as a serial output. This should work
unless you want to use the analogue inputs from the HC11 board.
As to using the SPI port I thought that this was a synchronous port rather
than the asynchronous serial port that is needed, correct me if I'm wrong.
