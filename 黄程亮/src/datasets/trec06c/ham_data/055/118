Hi, All


My name is Pocorobba Tino.I'm 33 y old and I live in Sicily (Italy).
I bought a copy of "Mobile Robots:inspiration to implementation" and I studied
it deeply.
I've now some problems and I hope that somebody will help me!!!
I'd like to construct a robot arm with six step motors and to make this the
motors have to be driven simoultaneously.
I started writing a IC-program that move only one motor:


int abs(int arg)
{ if (arg< 0)
  return (-arg); else return arg;}


void move1(int step1, long delay1)
{
          int i;
          if (step1>0)
	  poke(0x5000,0b00000001);
          else
	  poke(0x5000,0b00000000);
        for(i=0;i<abs(step1);i++)
				      {
					poke(0x4000,0b00000001);
                                        msleep(delay1);
                                        poke(0x4000,0b00000000);
                                        msleep(delay1);
					}

}
As you can note, the program generate a train of step1 impulse for delay1
frequence(gate 0x4000).The direction is fixed on gate 0x5000.
I'd like now construct a function tipe:
move(int step1,.,int step6, long delay1,., long delay6)
this function should drive simoultaneously six motors.
This is my first problem.
Now I tell you the second one.
The precedent IC-program has a limitation:the max frequence that can generate
is 2000 Hz.
I thought to write an ICB-program to go over this limitation


org	MAIN_START
variable_step1:
	FDB	0
subroutine_set_step1:
        std	variable_step1
 	rts
variable_delay1:
	FDB	0
subroutine_set_delay1:
        std	variable_delay1
 	rts

subroutine_move1:
	ldx	variable_step1      (number of impulses)
loop
        ldaa    #%10000000
        staa    $4000
        bsr     rit
        ldaa    #%00000000
        staa    $4000
        bsr     rit
        dex
        bne     loop
        rts
rit
        ldy     variable_delay1
inner
        dey
        bne     inner
        rts





int move11(int step1, int delay1)
{
        set_step1(step1);
        set_delay1(delay1);
        move1(0);
}

This program worked only once, why???
I'd like to build up a program driving six step motors simultaneously without
the limitation of the 2000 Hz.
Hoping You 'll help me I send you my best regards.
