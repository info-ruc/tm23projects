Hey there -
I'm trying to upload information from the Handy Board to my Linux machine.
I've reviewed the Handy Board FAQ and the Linux How-To, but I'm still
having some troubles....
I'm using the code at
http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html
to transmit data from the board, but I can't seem to receive the data on
the Linux machine.
I'd really appreciate it if anyone has any code or can point me in the
right direction!
Thanks!

CHRIS IRELAND
