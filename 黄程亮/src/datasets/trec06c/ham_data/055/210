I live in the Las Vegas metro area, and our PBS affiliate here runs 
Scientific American w/ Alan Alda on Tuesday nights here.  Last night's 
hour program was devoted entirely to robotics with a long segment on the 
robot soccer competition.  They also showed a group of Sony's new dog 
robot (name escapes me) programmed to play soccer, also.

If this program hasn't run in your PBS catchment area yet, keep an eye 
out for it.  It's worth watching.
