Hi all,

I would greatly appreciate information on line-followers and oscillating DC
wire-followers to use with the Handy Board. Which models are the most
practical? Where can I find the specs and instructions for these models? What
is the code for each to be interfaced with the Handy Board?

Thanks for your help.

Salpi
