Greg:

You can run assembly from within Interactive C, so if IC isn't fast enough for
you, you can build in something that is.  However, IC will execute pretty quickly
in terms of how fast steppers run, so it could be that IC will work for you
as-is?

If it won't, and you don't need to change any faster than 1000 times per second,
you can inbed your assembly routine in the system interrupt which runs at 1000
Hz.  This is very easy to do, and there are examples of how to do it in the IC
manual in the Handy Board Technical Reference under the "Docs" button on the
Handy Board site.

I'm sure people would like to know what you are doing, so please report back on
how it goes.

Good luck,

Gary Livick
