Hi, I am planning to use a Vector 2X compass with the Polaroid Sonar and 
expansion board but not sure about the SPI connection part. Before investing 
into the compass, I would appreciated if somebody could  tell me if they are 
successful in using both these devices simultaneoulsy with an expansion 
board. Thank you.

Best Regard,
Rob
