I have an old 486 laptop and a few motors and sensors lying around...Does
anyone know of a DSP board or some other device I could use to interface the
motors and sensors to the laptop for real- time data aquistion? (I already
have my handyboard performing some of the same functions on a similar project,
but I'd like to put the dusty laptop to some use).
Thanks.
