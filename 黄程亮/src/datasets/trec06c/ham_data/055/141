I thought of an idea, Im sure has been used before.  Where you have
three sensors (ie light or ir) equidistant on an arc and they are all
pointing towards the center of the arc.  So that when they are all the
same value the source is both right in front of the robot and as far
away as the radius of the arc.  Im just curious has anyone ever
implemented this?  If so what where your experiences with it.
