Hi,

My computer crashed three months ago and I lost my IC3.2 software. I have re-
downloaded it from Newton Labs IC page, but I do not have a record of my key.
I have written Newton Labs for my key, but they haven't responded yet
(actually, I just now wrote them). Does anybody have any other ideas what to
do?

How is Newton Labs customer service these days?
