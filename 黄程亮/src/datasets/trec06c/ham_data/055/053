Danny,
The Polaroid 6500 is very common, and if you have the expansion board
on your HB you have a built in connection.  There are drivers on the
MIT HandyBoard site.  The units are available from Acroname and they
also have a good fact sheet.

Before deciding on sonar for ranging you might take a look at using
the GP2D02 IR ranging unit.  Info at:
   http://www.acroname.com/robotics/parts/R19-IR02.html

If you are only looking for obstacle detection/avoidance, then a
simple IRPD unit will be easier and cheaper.  Dennis Clark has one
that works well at:

Have fun,
