Subject: How can I connect 100 photocells to my handyboard?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi,

For a project I'm working on, I need to track the output of one hundred
(100) photocells. I don't need great accuracy on any of them, but maybe
a ten-step resolution at the most. 

Is there a relatively standard or well-known method to gather several
such things and combine them into a number of signals that the
handyboard can handle?

Thanks a lot!
