Hi Everybody,
Ensio, I'm having a very similyar problem, but with an interesting twist!
Check this out! I still don't have any idea what is going on here...
None of these have expansion cards.

I have 5 HB's from when this robotics class was taught 2 years ago. 2 of them
do not work, 3 do. The two that don't work apparently worked at some
point, but will no longer download, will not synch.

We purchased 2 kits, and got stopped at the exact same place you did,
after we put in the memory we could download IC without errors, but
the HB's will not boot it.

So, in desperation, we purchased 2 brand spankin' new pre assembled
boards. Neither of these two will download at all. I see the green
light on the charger unit flash, but nada from the HB. 
I use the charger/communications unit that came with them.
If I use the windows DL program, it just says the board is not ready
or the port is wrong.
I took the cables and chargers from the working boards and used
them on one of the new ones. Nothing. I thought maybe my 200mhz
Nec laptop was too fast so I used on of the old Macs that we're using
successfully in the labs, still nothing.

The only thing I can think at this point is that all HB are not created
equal.

Any ideas?
thanks,
ed
