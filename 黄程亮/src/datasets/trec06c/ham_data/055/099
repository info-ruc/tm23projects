Hi HBoarders!
Can anybody help me with making my HB run? Following the instructions
from the assembly manual, there were no problems until installing the
memory. Before it, the serial communication worked fine with hbdl
downloading the pcode, although I had to use dl.exe to change the
config register value from 0x0D to 0x0C on the 68HC11A1FN. With
hbdl.exe or dlm.exe, this was not possible. After installing the
memory and LCD, downloading pcode is still possible, but only with
hbdl or dl, dlm displays board synchronization error. The bad thing is
that the LCD displays no message, only the bottom row displays full
5x7 characters. I do not think that the LCD is bad, it is new, just
packed out. I will check the LCD, but I think it is OK (it is a Data
Vision P 1-1113). The other thing is that the board does not want to
communicate with ic.exe. IC only reports synchronizing with board. I
am using a 400MHz Pentium II PC  with Windows 98 installed.
I really do not know where the problem is, I am trying to find it,
maybe it is the memory, but the behavior of the LCD is the same, with
or without memory, even without the 68HC11, only the voltage
connected.=20
If somebody had similar problems, or has an idea how to revive my HB,
it would be very helpful for me!

Many thanks,
