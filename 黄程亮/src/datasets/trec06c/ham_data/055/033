Bill, after unzipping the files, copy all the downloaded drivers into your 
interactive C Libs directory. These drivers must reside in this directory 
(drive:\IC\Libs) in order for IC to load them at startup. You will be asked 
if you want to replace these files, choose yes to all of them and make sure 
your master list (lib_hb.lis) look something like this:

lib_hb.c
lib_hb.icb
libexpbd.icb
expsens.c
expservo.icb
explego.icb
