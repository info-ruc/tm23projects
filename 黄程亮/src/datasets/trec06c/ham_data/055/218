Precedence: list

the lego 9v active sensors (i.e., rotation and light) require a pulsed
9v drive & appropriate drivers.

the circuit and drivers are part of the HB Expansion Board.  you could
potentially adapt both to work w/o the exp bd.  it's a 2 transistor
ckt with a diode protect.  you'd also need to rework the drivers
(source is there) if you went your own way.
