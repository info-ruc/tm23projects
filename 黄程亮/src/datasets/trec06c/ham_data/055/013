it might not be permanently dead, but if it's not, it's not working.

one (or more) of the outputs of these two chips is probably shorted to
ground or shorted to +5v.  the chips get hot when they try to drive
this output to a state other than the one it is shorted to.

with power off, get out your voltmeter and measure continuity from
each of the hc132 and ram pins to +5v and gnd.  find the pin(s) that
stuck in one of these states and shouldn't be.
