I also have downloaded the libraries for Sun, and I did everything that
the readme file saids but the only output that I have is:

"bash: ./ic: cannot execute binary file"

With the "dl" and the "mon" I have the same output:

bash: ./dl: cannot execute binary file

bash: ./mon: cannot execute binary file

I have downloaded the source code for the ic 2.86 but I can't compile as
quick as I have imagine. I think I must to make some changes in the
MakeFile to compile.

I think the same, may be I'm doing some thing wrong.
But the the version 3.1 runs well, the only problem is that it ask me
for the registration key.
The "dl" and "mon" that comes wiht 3.1 tgz file also run well.

Thanks,

Filipi
