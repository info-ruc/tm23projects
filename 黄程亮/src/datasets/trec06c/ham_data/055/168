Hi Greg,
  It all depends. Various features of the HB can be turned on and off to
change the amount of work done in the main ISR. By default the code uses
300ms to execute. The file lib_hb.c provides the following:

/********************************/
/*** System Interrupt Control ***/
/********************************/

/*

    These functions allow you to turn on and off various features
    controlled by the system interrupt routines.  The more features
    you turn off, the faster your code will run.

    On reset, the features have the following state:
       pulse width modulation ON
       infrared decoding      ON
       LCD printing           ON
       quad shaft decoding    OFF
       IR tranmission       OFF

    This uses approx. 30% of total CPU time.

    Approximate benchmarks:

x    Feature  % of CPU
    -------  --------
    PWM       3
    IR decode     11
    LCD printing (active)   8
    LCD printing (inactive) 1
    quad shaft decode     5
    IR transmission     1
