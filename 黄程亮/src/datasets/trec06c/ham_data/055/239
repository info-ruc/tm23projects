The International Institute for Qualitative Methodology is presently
planning future programs and evaluating the work we have accomplished in
the past two years.  More specifically, we are determining the interest in
courses for credit and a distance Ph.D. program with a major in qualitative
methodology.  We would appreciate any thoughts you may have on this issue,
as well as comments on any of the programs offered by the Institute
(described below).

The International Institute for Qualitative Methodology (IIQM)
<a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/">http://www.ualberta.ca/~iiqm/</a>
The IIQM is an international, interdisciplinary institute, with the mandate
of developing and training in qualitative methods.  More specifically, the
objectives of the Institute are to:
1)  Attract a group of international experts in qualitative methods who
will create an environment that will enhance the development of qualitative
methods.
2)  Provide a forum in which to address qualitative methodological problems
that relate to social science research and to develop innovative solutions
for those problems.
3)  Facilitate development of excellence in qualitative research by
educating, mentoring, and consulting with researchers.
4)  Enhance qualitative health research by stimulating interest and
providing leadership internationally into qualitative inquiry.
These  objectives are being attained in various ways.  First, bringing
together experts with a common interest, but with diverse backgrounds, acts
as a catalyst for problem solving as difficult methodological problems are
addressed.  The Institute provides a panel of experts to assist with
problems that occur in the conduct of qualitative research.  More formally,
University lectures, think tanks and lunch time seminars have been
organized to address areas that are of special concern, such as qualitative
causality.  These are held on a regular basis.  Workshops are sponsored in
the summer and on weekends during the academic year.
<p>
Activities
International Conferences: IIQM sponsors two conference series each year:
the Qualitative Health Research conference series and the Advances in
Qualitative Methods conference series. The 6th Annual Qualitative Health
Research conference will be held in Banff, Alberta, April 6-8, 2000 and in
2001 in Seoul, Korea. The 2nd Annual Advances in Qualitative Methods will
be held in Edmonton, February 2001.
University lectures and seiminars:  Lunch time seminars hare held at the
Institute bi-weekly during the academic year.  University lectures are
invited twice yearly.
Qual Institute Press:  Qual Institute Press publishes outstanding
qualitative research projects. To date, we have published six titles:
Madjar, Irena. (1998). Giving comfort and inflicting pain.
Sewall, Ian. (1998). The folkloral voice.
Martin, Karin. (1998). When a baby dies of SIDS: The parents' grief and
search for reason.
Malacrida, Claudia. (1998). Mourning of the dreams
Bach, Hedy E. F. (1998). A visual narrative concerning curriculum, girls,
photography, etc.
Evans, Rodney. (1999). The pedagogic principal.
Journals:  Qualitative Health Research is an international,
multidisciplinary journal for the health sciences and published six times
per year by Sage and is edited by Janice Morse.
<a href="http://www.ualberta.ca/~qhr">http://www.ualberta.ca/~qhr</a>
Workshops:  IIQM offers workshops throughout the year that are conducted by
leading experts in a variety of qualitative research methods. Summer
Institutes are held in June, July, and August.
Think Tanks:  An international group met twice this year to discuss "The
nature of qualitative evidence:  the contribution of qualitative inquiry."
Under consideration is the issue of how qualitative research fits into the
evidence-based medicine movement.  The think tank will result in an edited
text.
Residency Programs:  IIQM offers predoctoral and postdoctoral research
internships and residency programs for visiting professionals. IIQM is the
North American training site for NUD*IST (qualitative analysis software)
under agreement with Qualitative Solutions &amp; Research Pty Ltd. (Australia).
Consulting: Faculty and staff at the Institute assist in the development or
modification of research methods, analysis and dissemination.
<p>
International Linkage Sites: International sites are linked to the
Institute.  These sites provide leadership in their own geographic region,
organize workshops, communicate with each other by Internet or by other
forms of telecommunication, develop resource materials on qualitative
methods, and disseminate information about qualitative methods.
These International linkage sites are:

At this time the international sites are developing cooperating sites
within their own geographical areas:  Brazil has  identified 4 sites,
Mexico 5, and South Africa, 19.  The IIQM site is presently developing
linkages in North America.
