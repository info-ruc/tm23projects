Igor:

Sounds like you have two problems, with the LCD being a separate one from
the sync errors.

For communicating with the board via IC.exe, try changing your port
settings to 9600/8 data/no parity/1 stop/Xon/Xoff/FIFO buffers enabled.
I don't have much idea what most of this means, but it works on my
laptop, and I know if it isn't set this way on my machine the
communications don't work.  If these setting don't work, try changing the
flow control and shut off the FIFO buffers.

Once you can communicate, then we can get to the LCD problem if it still
exists.

Good luck,

Gary LIvick
