Hi John,

Just read your message about IR ranging. Do you have a site address as I
can't seem to find the site using a web search,
also what is the usual working range for standard IR collision detection as
I have been looking through some catalogs and they all have a couple of cm
at best, even IR proximity switches only go up to 5-10 cm and these are
seriously expensive.

cheers Russ.....

Using a 'hacked' GPIU58X (see Novasoft website for acrobat file
describing changes required) you can get an analogue reading relating to
the distance from an object. The transmitting LED has to be modulated at
the correct frequency and should be mounted with the HB. The acrobat
file list the possible ranges as 0.5 to 44 inches, but this does require
some extra software control.
I haven't tried this myself but I intend to in the near future.

Hope this helps.
