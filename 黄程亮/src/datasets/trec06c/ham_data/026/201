I'm not at all convinced by this. The key attribute of hand-helds is that
they work, wherever you go. If there's any requirement on communications,
they're going to fall over at some point. There's a big leap between being
able to make use of a network while it's there, and having to have one all
the time. Does Inferno support  data replication and conciliation?

Having said that, I find the idea of replaceable application servers deeply
attractive. At the moment, as you move around, your cell-phone attaches to
different cells. Systems like Ricochet could also an Inferno-based server
that provides facilities such as Dharaneedharan mentions "locally", while
your personal data either lives on your palmtop, or on the other side of
the world.
