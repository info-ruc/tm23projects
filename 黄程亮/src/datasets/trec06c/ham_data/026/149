>i came to learn what stable means: linux is perfectly stable between crashes.

all I can say is that my experience is exactly the opposite.  I have 3 pc's
(2 486DX2/66 and a 6x86) and they simply do not crash. (and I run much
more than just netscape and xterm.) the longest continuous uptime that
I recall was just over 70 days; they're in my living room so I do have
to power them down every once in a while when I vacuum...

current uptime stats are 1 day, 34 days and 25 days respectively.
(my 56K modem card seems to get into a bad state that can only be
cleared by a power cycle; hence the 1 day uptime for the first machine.
just got a new modem card to replace it, with a Lucent chip, I'm
sure it will work perfectly...)

perhaps you were exerting a psychotronic effect on these systems that
you were using? ie, your ill-will towards them caused them to crash...
;-)
