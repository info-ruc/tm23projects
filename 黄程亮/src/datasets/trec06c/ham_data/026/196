Well put. It's disappointing that this needed to be said, since
I would have thought it was self-evident.

Let's get back to the jokes.

I suspect that, like me, Dennis uses the right tool for the job.
Plan 9 is wonderful, but it isn't supported by commercial apps.
There is no way that a small development team can provide all
the useful apps that one can obtain (free or cheaply) for the
Windows environment.  For example, I require Photoshop, S-Plus,
and Mathematica or some close equivalent, but there is (to my
knowledge) no close equivalent available on Plan 9.

Consequently, my own PC can be booted into Windows 95, NT,
Plan 9, or Solaris, all with C/C++ development environments,
and hosts Inferno and Java Workshop as well.  I get to choose
the most appropriate environment for whatever I need to do.
