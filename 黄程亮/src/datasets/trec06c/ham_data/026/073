I encountered the same problem with the DC motors I use on my robot.
I used a reflective type encoder that read a black and white stripe of the
driving wheels, but did not work reliably due to
lack of resoulution and interference from ambient light.

I want to try to get some comercial quadruature encoders with a resolution
of min100 ppr. and give it a try.
The other problem that I encountered is that if one of the motors is slighty
slower then the other and you use diferential steering
it will arc towards the slower motor some sort of PID might also help.

If you decide to go the stepper way check out this homepage
http://www.cctc.demon.co.uk/stepper.htm

B.T.W. if you don't mind I would be interested in the code you used with the
saft encoder.

Thanks,
