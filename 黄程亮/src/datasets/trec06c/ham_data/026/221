Not the world's best wording is it?

Since you have a scsi drive, you want 'disk/prep /dev/sd?'.  ls -l /dev/sd*
to see what's there after the bind and replace ? with the right number.

It works for non-PC's, or at least used to.  Just don't expect to see any DOS
partitions to be found.

A sun can be stand-alone.

Hi,

I have a SPARCstation 2 which I can network boot using u9fs
running on a local Unix machine, and I am trying to set it
up to use its local hard disk.

I can see the disk ok after doing a
	bind -a '#w1' /dev
But can't figure out how to partition and format it.

PREP(8) requires as argument a 'special', which is described
as a 'maximal prefix of names of the logical units on the disk',
but I can't find a definition of what this means. The example
given is '#w/hd0', but I don't see how that relates to '#1'?

Also, the '-a' is supposed to create default partitions on a
new disk, but the description indicates this includes a DOS
partition, so I am worried that maybe this is for the PC
version only....

Finally, the entry for the sparc in BOOTING(8) only mentions
net booting. Can a Sun be made into a stand alone Plan9
workstation?

Thanks,
DigbyT
