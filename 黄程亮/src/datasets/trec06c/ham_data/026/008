I enclose details of our latest internet vs. telecom report.  =20
  =20
The Internet=27s leading companies have enjoyed a stunning rise (traffic, =
net revenues), and have established themselves as powerful brands, thanks =
to a handful of extremely popular key services. Their business models rely=
 a great deal on advertising services and distribution, for low per-unit m=
argin but high volume markets.   =20
  =20
So these Internet giants are working to be as big as they can, by offering=
 an array of (possibly free) appealing services. They are battling it out =
chiefly amongst themselves in the services market, seeking to gain a great=
er share of the pie, while also destroying rival services=27 value by offe=
ring certain paid services for free, or at drastically reduced prices.   =
=20
  =20
This ongoing battle of the Internet giants is not without consequences for=
 the telecom industry. Concerned with creating new revenue streams, telcos=
 can either elect to develop their own service offerings directly, or to j=
oin forces with Internet portals and act as intermediaries. These partners=
hips offer real opportunities, albeit varying depending on the nature of t=
he service. The leading telecom operators, and mobile operators in particu=
lar, have been adopting very different approaches.   =20
  =20
But portals=27 appetite goes well beyond fixed and mobile services, and th=
e Internet giants could well prove a direct threat to telcos=27 longstandi=
ng access-centric business model. Recent developments are in fact allowing=
 them to launch full frontal attacks on the Internet access (virtual opera=
tors, Wi-Fi), voice (VoIP), TV and mobile access (MVNO) markets.   =20
