Right. If you're trying to do that, good luck!!! If I ABSOLUTELY had to do
that, I would try to use the reflectance of the disk. On the black spot I
would read zero. But it would be waaaay too much trouble.

Well the idea of putting a tore with some wire is one of my favorite idea.
Problems are:

1. the voltage output would have to be converted to DC throught a diode and
smoothed with some capacitors

2. the diode has some voltage drop, which you must take in consideration if
you want to take precise mesurements. If your goal is to get an overall
picture of your consumption, then if you read 0 with the handyboard, your
appliance may be completely off or using few amps (a CD player turned off
can still use 8 watts!)

3. if i had to do this, I would like to isolate the low voltage section and
the high voltage section... If something had to happen, I don't want my
handyboard to get fried.. maybe using some 1/8 fuses or less?

4. What the insurances would say if they knew you played around with your
electrical panel? ;) Do you have an electrician license?

5. Considering all this trouble, I think I prefer buying an amprobe and
keep my handyboard for controlling a stepper motor mounted on my vertical
stores =)

Cya!
