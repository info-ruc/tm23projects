don't forget to check that ndb/dns is actually running.
ndb/cs uses it (via /srv/dns union mounted on /net) to
translate domain names.
ps will show you if the ndb/dns
is running.  if it isn't you'll need to start it in /rc/bin/termrc
(or start it in /rc/bin/cpurc on a cpu server and import it in /rc/bin/termrc).
