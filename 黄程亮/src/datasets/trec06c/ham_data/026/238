Good application, although it is a bit of a challenge.

Do you want to measure the individual devices, or the whole house?

To do the individual devices you would have to have sensors right next
to the devices. To monitor each circuit in the house, you can put
sensors in the fuse box. To do the whole house, you can have a single
sensor where the power comes in the house.

There was an article in Circuit Cellar ink about 2 years ago on how to
do this. The sensors where a torroid core wrapped with wire.  The AC
induces a voltage into this coil.  I think the article had 5-10 wraps
of wire getting 0-5volts, so the analog port would give you the
inputs. 

Good luck.
