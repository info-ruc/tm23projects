That's strange.  I've had quite a different experience.
Mine is a newer model, ten years younger than Unix.      
It requires daily down time or it mostly stops functioning.  
Proper (and frequent!) care and feeding is essential as 
well, unlike (say) a Palm Pilot that lasts three months 
on a single set of batteries.

Despite the almost unlimited storage capacity, throughput
is comparatively (and frustratingly!) small.  Long-term data
loss is increasingly a problem and it doesn't come with ECC
memory.  Computational power is annoyingly limited;   
it would be nice if there were an upgrade kit to add
a couple extra processors.
