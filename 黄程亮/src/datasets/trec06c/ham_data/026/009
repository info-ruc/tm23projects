Hi,

I am having problems with one of the converted SPI pins, specifically
the MOSI pin. This is what I did,

poke (1009, 0x3c);
bit_set (1008, 0x08);

I then checked the pin with a logic probe and got a low. I sifted
through the other pins and they worked. Also I tried this onto two HBs.

Thank you,
Faris
