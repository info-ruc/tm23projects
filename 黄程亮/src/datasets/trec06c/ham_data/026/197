The next version the same project had Papyrus handwriting recognition
module running in Inferno with file tree interface. So we were even able to
keep
the recognizer itself in the network. It was evident that a powerful
multi-lingual
recognizer with huge dictionaries and look-up tables can be kept in the
host
while the device is still of same size.

With new communication mechanisms like wireless modem, waveLAN, irDA,
bluetooth,
etc., things seem to be very promising. In fact, in an Inferno based
solution,
you will only need to have a device with display and input method.
Everything 
else can be in a remote place. Imagine using a thin device with LCD display
and a keyboard anywhere to browse, organize personal information, do home
automation, etc!!
