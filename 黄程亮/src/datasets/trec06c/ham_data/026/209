Hi all,

I just got my Tech America catalog in the mail (1-800-877-0072).

On the back cover they have this 'portable power' thing which just might be
able to be used for a robotics application...for only $30!!!

Here's the specs:

8 Amp Hour sealed lead-acid battery.
"Great for charging power tools or running portable TV's..."
8 hour charge from 110v AC or
3 hour charge from 12v DC.

I don't know anything about power supplies or power systems, but I am looking
for some external power source to use with the Handyboard and External Motors.

Do you think this will work?  
Anyone know what circuitry I would need to add to use this battery?
Could I just plug it into the terminals after making the external power supply
motor mod on the Handyboard?  Or, would that fry my HandyBoard?

Thanks
