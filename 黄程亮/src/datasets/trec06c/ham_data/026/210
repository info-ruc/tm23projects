Hello, everyone:

   One of my students and I have been trying to get two HandyBoards
to talk to each other over their serial ports, but we are having
trouble.

   We first wired a 4-wire modular connector the way the FAQ says to.
No smoke -- a good sign.

   Then we used serialio.c (linked to on the FAQ) to create a
test program.

   The receiving robot never gets past the test of the data ready
bit of the SCSR location.  Moreover, when we comment out the wait,
apparently no data is being placed into the SCDR location in
the receiving robot.  These symptoms occur whether or not 
the sender and receiver call disable_pcode_serial() (and whether
reenable_pcode_serial() is called in there anywhere).

   Our 4-wire connector cable tests out OK with an ohmmeter.

   Does anyone have any suggestions of what we can try next?

   Has anyone had any success in getting two HandyBoards to communicate
through their serial ports?

   Oh, by the way, we're running the 2.82 (freeware) version of the
PCODE interpreter and ic.

   Thanks.
