good question. making a SPARC kernel with kfs is easy (the
Plan 9 FAQ even tells you how). booting that off the net is
similarly easy. booting from a local disc... that part has
escaped me. in the end i worked out that the only way it
was going to work was if i left a minimal Solaris partition
on my disc with the second- and third-stage boot loaders
and replaced the Unix kernel with the Plan 9 one. sadly a
friend had kindly installed Solaris 2.6 over Solaris 2.5 on
my little old IPC, and the boot loader in 2.6 only supports
ELF binaries. i don't have an ELF kernel, and frankly haven't
the faintest idea how to make one easily. versions of
Solaris earlier than 2.6 may (i'm wary of being more
confident, though i know forsyth used to boot an SLX from
local disc) support booting of a Plan 9 kernel.

as if one needed any more reason _not_ to "upgrade" to a
new version of Solaris...

[my IPC is currently running a stripped-down Solaris 2.6
install and has a very minor role on the network. and to
think it could have been running acme and 5s!]
