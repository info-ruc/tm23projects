Anyone can help me?


I have a ASAP proximity reader connected to the SPI port. I find some 68H=
C11
never detect signaling coming from Asap to the SPI port. Others work
excelent. Except at 2 or 3 months begin working that fail definitively. I
replace the 6811 but nothing come to live!!! I=B4m using two Resistors of=
 1K
because the ouput for the ASAP are open collectors.  Which can be the
trouble (Fred?).
