Drew,
     Last year I was involved in getting parts for the Missouri Area Robotics
Society.  We were making boards as a club project.  I found most of the parts
from Digi-key and Mouser Electronics.  The rest came from:  Wirz Electronics,
JDR Micro devices, Jameco, and B.G. Micro.

To contact:
Digi-Key                    800-344-4539  www.digikey.com
Mouser Electronics     800-346-6873  www.mouser.com
Wirz Electronics         www.wirz.com
JDR Micro devices     800-538-5000  www.jdr.com
Jameco                     800-831-4242  www.jameco.com
B.G. Micro                 800-276-2206
