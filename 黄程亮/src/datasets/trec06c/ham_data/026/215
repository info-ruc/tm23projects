My organizer has never crashed on me, and I've had it since before Unix
existed. It does OCR without having to learn someone's handwriting,
voice recognition, supports I18N, has almost unlimited storage capacity,
and an easy-to-use (actually, invisible) OS/GUI.  It requires no batteries
and has survived several collisions against concrete, ice and skulls.
I've never forgotten it, needed to back it up, swapped the hardware or
patched the software.  Hopefully, I never will.

Computer hardware and software still has a long way to go.
