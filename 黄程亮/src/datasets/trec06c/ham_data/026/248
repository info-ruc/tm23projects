Subject: RE: Monitoring household power consumption

I purchased a power meter from Brand electronics.  They have a few 
different models.  There is one that is suitable for measuring the costs of 
one device and there is a larger one that has to be hardwired into your 
house.  Check out http://www.mint.net/~ebrand/
They are pretty nice little devices.
