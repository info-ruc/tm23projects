My Greetings to you,


I am Mrs. Rashida Omar from Libya. I am married to Late Abdullah Omar of =
blessed memory who was an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years; =
before he died in the year 2000. We were married for twelve years without a =
child.

My husband died after a brief illness that lasted for only four nights. Since =
his death I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problems. =
When my late Husband was alive he deposited a substantial amount of money in =
millions of dollars with a Finance Firm oversea.

Recently, my doctor told me that I have only six months to live in this world =
due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a =
charity/orphanage home or devoted God fearing individual/company that will =
utilize this money the way I am going to instruct herein. I want this =
organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund charity =
homes (motherless homes),orphanages, and widows.

Although, I took this decision because I don't have any child that will =
inherit this money and my husband relatives are into radical organization
and I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy =
manner. Hence the reasons for this bold decision. Please, pray for me to =
recover as your prayers will go a long way in uplifting my spirit. I don't =
need any telephone communication in this regard, because of the presence of =
my husband's relatives around me always and my doctor has advised me not to =
speak on phone because of my health.
I don't want them to know about this development.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you further directives on what =
to do and how to go about actualizing this project. I will also issue a
letter of authorization to the Finance Company authorizing them that the said =
fund has being willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be =
forwarded to you.

I want you to always pray for me. However, any delay in your reply will give =
room in sourcing for an organization or a devoted Individual for this same =
purpose.

Until I hear from you by email and you can as well reply to this email =
address;
omarr006@email.ro,my dreams will rest squarely on your shoulders.



Remain Blessed.
Mrs.Rashida Omar.
