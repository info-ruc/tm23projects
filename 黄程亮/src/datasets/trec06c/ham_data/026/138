Plan 9 reduced much unneccessary efforts from system
management and programming.   Yes, I deeply agree.

However, it'd be better, I think, to consider what would be
her merrit for general users like me.  Genral users don't
care what ever the system is.  They have interests only
on applications.  I have one point regarding its international
nature from the bottom.  We have to fight against old
standard though.  :-)

Sorry of delay of response.  I've just returned from
Maui.
