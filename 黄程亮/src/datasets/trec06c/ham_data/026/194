The GPIU58X is not an IR proximity switch but the hack provides an
analogue level relating to the intensity of the received signal.
Novasoft also sell the IR receivers (it's where I got mine from and I'm
based in the UK).
The address of Novasoft is :
http://www.mil.ufl.edu/novasoft/


As an extra piece of information, I remember somebody recently
mentioning the video capture used by Joker Robotics in Germany. When I
last checked their site (which was a fair time ago) the Quickcam robot
was actually using a 68000 based board mounted on a Hexapod chassis.
Their address is :
http://www.joker-robotics.com/


Hope this helps.
