> What is the merrit to have Inferno on note PC?

>From what I've read, inferno has the same namespace coolness
that Plan9/Brazil has. Think about how nice that would be for a
hand-held. Instead of needing to squeeze apps into the tiny 1-4mb
memory-storage on a pilot (or spending big bucks to get an 8mb chip),
you could have all the storage be on a "pilot-server" sitting on a
computer with a real harddrive.

	o No more worries about backing up the pilot
	o Almost automatic groupware funcionality
	o You could "download" software to the pilot
		(in reality, your harddisk) via your computer's
		network connection -- instant install without
		the need for serial-cable downloads. 
	o No more need to hotsync between your PC and your pilot.
		both apps read the same files!
	o Pilot hardware can be dedicated more toward
		to screen i/o, and cache.
	o Having the equiv of /bin/cpu would be nice!

They have tiny ricochet modems (wireless PPP-capable modems) that are
about the size of the pilot. *I* think it would be cool. :)

> I have no idea on Inferno though. ;_;
