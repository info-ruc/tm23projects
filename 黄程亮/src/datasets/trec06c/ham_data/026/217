Subject: Unix sources for dl for E1

I have been using various boards (6.270, Handyboards and fingerboards) for
a long time and on various platforms (Macintosh mainly).
I am willing to use my handyboard from linuxPPC on my macintosh, so i
recompiled dl, ic and mon. It works fine with all my boards except the ones
that have 68HC11E1 instead of A1 controllers. I know that this is due to
the handling of the bootloader in dl and mon.

As i know that this problem has been solved for other ports (PC and Mac)
i'm looking for the changes to be done to the sources to handle the E1 as
well as the A1..... I'm ready to dig in the source code.
