> Does it have the same source-code coolness?

it's possible to buy a source licence, but the price i heard
was well out of my league. i don't think buying the source
is a realistic option for an individual.

as long as the documentation is so vague, there's unlikely
to be a free alternative. i know i couldn't guess the format
of the link section, for example.

P.S. i've just realised (and wasn't in hold mode!) that you
might not mean kernel source. if you're talking about the
source to the contents of /bin, then /appl is the place to
look. /appl/cmd/sh.b is the source to /dis/sh.dis, for
example. unfortunately, things like the TK graphics library
aren't written in limbo. so you don't get any source there,
and are limited in what you can do to (say) the window
manager.
