Robbie Berg and Capt. Jack Rutledge:

I'm a big fan of the Handy Board, but you might want to also consider usi=
ng a 3Com
PalmPilot.  The current model, Palm III, has a backlit 160x160 graphics d=
isplay, a
2MByte memory, and while I haven't used it, there is a company that makes=
 a GPS for
it.  I know that there are numerous real time mapping products out there =
already
that use the PalmPilot.

It sounds like your database of  "waypoints" would consist primarily of  =
a list of
X,Y coordinates, and be limited in area, so I would think that a database=
 on the
order of a few 100,000 waypoints could be stored in a Palm III.  And if y=
ou need
more memory there are lots of other handheld computers out there with gra=
phics
displays.

Since you are a pilot I'm sure you are familiar with GPS technology, but =
if you've
never used one for ground based applications you might want to also resea=
rch
"differential" GPS.  I would think that finding a hydrant hidden in some =
bushes
might require some very good resolution.  I've used GPS for hiking and fo=
r mapping
the location of trees and plants, so I know that the real world performan=
ce of *low
cost* GPS units on the ground can be very poor.  Some of the toughest pla=
ces for a
GPS to perform are in hilly, heavily forested terrain, but also in metrop=
olitan
areas with tall buildings and lots of potential noise sources.
