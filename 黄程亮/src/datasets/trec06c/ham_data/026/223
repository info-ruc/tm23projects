I've done this with a MIPS Magnum workstation, but not a sparc.
You'll need a kernel with kfs support, try 
'diff /sys/src/9/magnum/magnum /sys/src/9/magnum/magnumdisk' for help with that

There are scripts in the subdirs of /rc/bin for setting up standalone systems
Take a look at /rc/bin/magnum/home, which preps the disk
copies the boot partition and kernel, then uses kfs to
setup the filesystem. You'll probably want to run disk/prep manually.
You might not need a boot partition with sparcs.

Once your system is setup and running, you can sync it with your
fileserver by running something like /rc/bin/magnum/update
