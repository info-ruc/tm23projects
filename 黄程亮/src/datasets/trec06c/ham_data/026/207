Hi all,

Just a quick question on charging different types of batteries. I have got a
6Amp 12Volt Nicad battery out of a security alarm
panel, can i charge this using a normal lead acid charger that normally
charges car batteries, If not what is the difference in cahrging methods
between lead acid and nicad as obviously the handy board wall plug charger
rated at 700mAh would not do the job.


Regards Russ.......
