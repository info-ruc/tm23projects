Everyone seems to perceive some psychic effect or bad hardware.
It wasn't the hardware; we replaced that once to no avail and I could
crash others' machines that were otherwise stable just by using them
for a few minutes.

The anti-Midas touch, I guess.  I guarantee it wasn't psychic.

But I should add that around here, we have also seen much Linux
instability.  I suspect that, like most systems including ones I have built,
Linux is stable until it gets used in a new way, usually by a new
user.  Even so, the claims of Linux's perfection seem untenable
given my experiences with it in several versions on a variety of
hardware.

And that is my last word on the subject here; this is 9fans.
