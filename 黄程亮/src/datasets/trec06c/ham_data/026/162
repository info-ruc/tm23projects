Has anybody had any experience interfacing machine vision systems to a
robot controlled by a handyboard?=20=




The German company Joker Robotics does something using a QuickCam
style camera interfacing an HC11 board robot=2E  I think they use the Mobile
Robot board and they don't use a frame grabber so I'm not sure what the
system is actually capable of although they show a hexapod robot with a
quickcam head that certainly LOOKS cool=2E  I don't have the web address
but they are easy to find=2E
