>>This sounds most unusual. I hardly think Linux would have enjoyed such
>>popularity were it as prone to crashing as you suggest. I've been using

it was my impression that the most common operating system today
was indeed one of the least reliable.  it must be popular
with someone.  (i wasn't thinking of solaris,
though that's a close second in the unreliability stakes, in my
experience, even after applying Jumbo patches.)
perhaps o/s popularity increases with instability (much like politicians).
i can't comment about linux: i installed it several times (until i got one that worked)
but then found i had no reason ever to run it, so i turned the disc
into a paging file to get some work out of it.

anecdotal experience doesn't seem to me to settle the matter, and
i think this is all irrelevant in the context of the original message:
surely someone (even dmr) can run what he likes on a `personal' computer?
