I don't see anything surprising here. If you are coming from
Plan9, your expectations are high and Linux seems flakey.

If, like a majority of Linux users, you are a Windows refugee,
two commands in a row without a crash and you are ecstatic.

My impression is that the BSD derivatives are a little more
stable because they are more conservative. Linux has a somewhat
more adventurous, bohemian development philosophy, for which
there is a slight robustness penalty. Even so, I can believe
that many people use it for years without ever seeing a problem.

The only mystery is why Rob would have let someone load a clone
of an ancient Bell Labs operating system on his PC in the
first place :-)
