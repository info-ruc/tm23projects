Someone pointed out that I had been responding to an ancient message.
That confused me, since it was marked as an unseen message in my inbox.
I think what happened is my auto-indexing auto-filing script must have
gotten confused and popped it in there -- I don't see any indication that
anybody else got that message!  Sorry for the confusion!
