For an example, Plan 9 uses Unicode to deal with many 
languages, and UTF-8 for its communication.  
I agree with those choices as a reasonable base.

However, unfortunately, there have been locale
standard in many advanced countries.  Japan
is not an exception of this.  We have to communicate
with many others based on those "localed" machines.
Well, network is communication!

In such a situation, we have always two choices, one
is accepting the foregoing standard, which free-unices
are following as, and the other is a harder way where
we are now facing.  Logically speaking, the latter
is wright.  However,... Plan 9 might be too much logical 
for many of general users.  Furthermore, according to my
understanding, those general users seem to be getting
controle of the future networking environment as a
large mass.  It's not worthy to teach them what is better
from technical point of view.

For an example, if we want to use TeX( I mean 
Japanese version), we have to work more than 
those of other free-unix users.
