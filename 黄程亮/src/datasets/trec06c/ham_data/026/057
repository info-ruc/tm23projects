No, this command doesn't seem to exist on the pc distribution..

  I used nslookup from my linux box and got the names of the servers like you
suggested. I put them in my /lib/ndb/local file but still get the error
"can't translate address". I'll include my /lib/ndb/local file this time in
case there is any obvious error.

#
#  external internet domain service

dom=
        ns=ns1.worldnet.att.net
        ns=ns3.worldnet.att.net

dom=ns1.worldnet.att.net ip=204.127.129.1
dom=ns3.worldnet.att.net ip=204.127.160.1

#
#  your PC (edit to suit)
#
sys = carrera
        dom=carrera.plan9.org
        ip=165.238.0.36 ether=0020afec18ca ipmask=255.255.255.0
        ipgw=165.238.0.33
        bootfile=/386/9pcdisk
        proto=il

There isn't a section titled network like in your example but there is this
in the ndb file supplied with the PC distribution which I haven't changed.:

#
#  your ip networks and subnets (edit to suit)
#
ipnet=mh-astro-net ip=135.104.0.0 ipmask=255.255.255.0
        ipgw=135.104.9.1
        fs=bootes.research.att.com
        auth=1127auth
ipnet=third-floor ip=135.104.51.0
        ipgw=135.104.51.1
ipnet=fourth-floor ip=135.104.52.0
        ipgw=135.104.52.1


Anything under this point was unchanged from the origimal file on the pc
distribution.
There is a lot of stuff that looks like all Bell labs internal stuff. Is
there anything obvious missing?

Thanks,
Mike
