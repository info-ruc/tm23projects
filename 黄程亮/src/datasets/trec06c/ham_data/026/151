This sounds most unusual. I hardly think Linux would have enjoyed such
popularity were it as prone to crashing as you suggest. I've been using
linux for around 4 years, I don't think I've ever had it crash once,
(although X has died a couple of times) I'm sure many others will vouch
for its stability.
