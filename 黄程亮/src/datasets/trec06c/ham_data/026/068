I read somewhere that someone was selling the "hard to find parts" of
the HB including the DS1233, HC11, motor controllers and an LCD=2E  I can't
find it now=2E=2E=2E does anyone know of such a thing??? It would help=2E  P=2ES=2E=

to anyone who is considering building a HandyBoard from a bare PC
board may I suggest simply buying a pre-built and tested unit=2E  There is no
cost savings really, though I built one myself mostly for the experience of
it=2E    -Drew
