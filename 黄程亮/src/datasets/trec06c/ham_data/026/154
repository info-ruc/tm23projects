> 	I think you had a hardware problem, or you were using
an experimental version. Some friends use Linux for work, as
HTTP server, DNS... and I have seen uptimes in excess of months. In
fact, those are their most stable machines. (The others have MS operating
systems).

	And my experience with FreeBSD (which I prefer to Linux) has also
been excellent. I have had no problems. I can recall it only crashed once,
when I was trying a "snapshot" of a development branch. 

	Regarding Linux, there are too many "distributions" and
it is too chaotic. But, anyway, it works.
