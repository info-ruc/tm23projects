Hi,

I was trying to use the digital inputs for my project.
Whether I ground the inputs, or I connect them to high,
a read from 0x7fff gives me "76". (My connections are
correct, as per your drawing in this mail archive).

I finally discovered, that in the slot where I should find a 74HC244,
my handyboard has a 74HC374N. Please let me know
what I need to do to use those inputs.

Thanks,
Anuradha Mulukutla,
