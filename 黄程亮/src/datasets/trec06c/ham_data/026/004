It's also worth pointing out that you don't really
need to know the names of your nameservers.  Just
make them up!

I just use this and it works fine for me.

dom=
	ns=harvard0
	ns=harvard1
	ns=harvard2

dom=harvard0 ip=140.247.21.21
dom=harvard1 ip=140.247.21.22
dom=harvard2 ip=128.103.200.101

Remember that after you change this, you'll
need to restart dns, and the easiest way to 
do this is to just reboot [sic].
