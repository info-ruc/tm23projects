No.  You need to limit the current going through the nicad when you charge
it.  Typically it's some relatively small fraction the the current the
battery can supply.  Car battery chargers can supply a LOT of current.
Hooking a small nicad to a car battery charger would be a BAD idea.

Determine the ammount of current the nicad can handle, pick the
appropriate series resistor, and then you can use the 12V car charger.
