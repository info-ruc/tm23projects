when i was on sabbatical the university installed linux on the PC on my desk.
it crashed regularly, several times a week. the netscape on it crashed at least
several times as often; i never enabled java on it.  everyone else in the department
said that i was crazy; linux was very stable, etc. etc.  they changed hardware,
it made no difference.  i sat down at their desks and crashed their machines,
always by doing nothing more than running xterm and netscape to look at
ordinary things.  a friend of mine sat at my desk, typed a single url to her own
perfectly sane home page, and hung the machine completely.

i came to learn what stable means: linux is perfectly stable between crashes.
