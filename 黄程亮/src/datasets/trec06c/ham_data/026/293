Subject: [9fans] How to use strdup()?

strdup(2) uses malloc(2), but does not free it.
When the malloced memory space will be freed?

I'm facing memory problem in news reader having
more than 2000 unread articles which
uses the strdup() more than 2000 times, and 
then  fails in malloc. 

Is this mean not to use strdup() in that situation?
