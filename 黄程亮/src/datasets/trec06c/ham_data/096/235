   It was needed for a task here and I'd more or less designed the changes 
to the code in my head some time ago so it was happening regardless.  And 
the mouse I tossed in because (a) I just know I'll get people clamoring for 
it and (b) it was relatively easy to add there and then so I did.  Of 
course I just realized it won't handle multimon installations of DMDX but 
that's for the future...

   There are three ways to get something done - do it yourself,
hire someone to do it, or ask your kids not to do it.
