            From the desk of
            Bill and exchange manager
            BANK  OF AFRICA(BOA)
            AMUDA LORGU.
           Ouagadougou,
            Burkina  Faso.


Dear Friend,


I am the manager, incharge of bill and exchange of the Bank Of Africa (BOA) 
foreign remittance department.There is a business l would want you to 
champion for me.In my department l discovered an abandoned sum of US $30m 
(Thirty  million united states dollars)In an account that belongs to one of 
our foreign customer mr Abdullu Haruna from Brunei.who died along with his 
entire family in Novmber 1999 in an Aeroplane crash in Abidjan coast in Cote 
D'Ivoire. (for more information about this crash and the person,please visit 
this  website: XXXX://www.s-t.com/daily/11-99/11-02-99/d08ho174.htm).



Since we got information about his death,we have been expecting his  next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we can not release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines,but unfortunately we  learnt that all 
his supposed next of kin or relation died along side  with him in the plane 
crash leaving noone as the right beneficairy to his balance with our bank.

It is therefore upon this discovery that l decided to make this business 
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of  kin or relation 
to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement  since nobody is 
coming for it and we don’t want this money to go into  the bank treasury as 
unclaimed fund.

The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe can not stand as 
next of kin to him.l have agreed,  that after the smooth conclusion of the 
transaction,that l will make it 60-40 for you considering you as a foreign 
partner,in respect to the  provision of a foreign account,There after l will 
visit your country  for disbursement according to the percentage agreed.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you account as  
arranged,you will apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin  of 
the deceased,indicating your full name,your private telephone and fax 
numbers for easy and effective communication and the location  where in the 
money will be remitted.Upon the receipt of your reply,  l will send to you 
by EMAIL OR FAX the text of the application.

Be you informed that this transaction is hitch free both now and in the 
future you should not entertain any fear whatsoever,as all required  
arrangements have been perfected for the transfer.Trusting to hear from you 
immediately.

Yours faithfully
AMUDA LORGU
Bill and exchange manager(BOA).
