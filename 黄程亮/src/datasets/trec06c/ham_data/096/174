I recently had the same problem (on an XP machine) and, for me, it turned out to
be as simple as adjusting the sound parameters in windows.  When you go to the
volume controls for windows, it defaults to showing you the PLAYBACK options,
not the RECORDING options.  And so while it can look like you've got your
Line-In/Microphone (whichever you are using) selected and turned all the way
up, they might not actually be.  Go to 'properties' and select the 'recording'
volume controls and set them accordingly.

Not sure if this will be relevant given the NT issue though.

good luck.
