Oh, it does.  Which isn't really the problem (and easy to fix in the script).

What happens is that I get error messages telling me that there is no such thing as a "left shift key" (because it isn't called that in Swedish, of course), but the name of the key is not something I (at least routinely) specify in my DMDX script.  I just name the device, and in the past all has been taken care of (except when I want to do remapping of course).  It would be great if I wouldn't have to do some extensive renaming of standard input keys like the two shift keys and the mouse button (things I wouldn't have to do in english).
