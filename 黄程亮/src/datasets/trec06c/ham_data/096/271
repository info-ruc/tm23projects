Dear All:

Just a complement to the message of Vladik and Michel Rueher. You
will find at
http://www-sop.inria.fr/coprin/index_english.html
an on-line interface to the ALIAS solver that allows one to submit a system
of up to 5 equations/inequalities and (maybe..) get the solutions of the
system. The computation time is limited to 5 minutes.
Best
