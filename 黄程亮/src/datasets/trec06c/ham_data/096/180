Dear Dr.Wang,

   Here is a recap of my progress for this week, and what has been done so 
far:
- Adding new question/Assessment (including images), (this is done). 
- View/Del/Edit any question, (this is done). 
- Rename/Delete/View any Assessment, (this is done). 
- Import/Export any question(s) of teacher's database from and to the school 
database, (this is done).

- A new link 'Process/Display' has been added for each teacher's Assessment so 
the teacher can choose any of three display options (By):
 1) A given order only, OR
 2) All questions/options are in Random order, OR
 * 3) Random questions, Non-Random options.
The last option has been done, (i.e. by choosing option 3, the teacher will go 
to a 'preview' of the whole questions of the chosen assessment in which all 
the questions are displayed randomly, but options are non-Random and also  
answers are displayed for each question (this is done).

- Then: A teacher can start a test by clicking on "start a test" button, which 
takes the students to a test page, including a field for 'student name' and 
also all the questions are displayed randomly, but options are non-Random; 
each student has completely different view of the test (this is also done).

- After a student clicks 'Submit your answers', his name and all his answers 
of each question are stored in the database for grading and retrieval by the 
teacher (this includes creating new tables and connect them to together, etc. 
this is also has been done).

- I actually spent some time on designing and fixing some problems.. Since my 
design, I think, works easily and 'dynamically' so the teacher can add or 
remove questions of any type easily, and they can be added and viewed in any 
test(assessment), for example, I am using a lot of 'dynamic arrays in the  
forms instead of static ones, since a test can have many questions of the same 
types, etc. Anyhow, I have fixed them and solved some other technical 
problems..

I am working continuesly on this, so next step will be grading and retrieving  
student answers (view by 'student name' or by a 'test', etc.). but here I have 
a question:
    Should the grades of the questions (except essay and short ones), assigned 
by a teacher, be numbers or percentages? (i.e. like: 10, or 10% ?).

* Note: I will provide a link to that, but i think it is better after grading 
and retrieving the students answers..

Thank you,

Saleh Al-shomrani.
