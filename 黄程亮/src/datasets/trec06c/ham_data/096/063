Dear Colleagues,

those of you interested in the validated integration of ODEs may enjoy a very
extended paper on the use of Taylor models for this purpose. In particular it
discusses in detail various anti-wrapping strategies that naturally follow
from the use of Taylor models and provides many comparisons to other
approaches.
