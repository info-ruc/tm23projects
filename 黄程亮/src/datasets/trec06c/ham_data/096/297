Hello everyone,

I am designing a self paced reading experiment. Is there any way I can use
the space bar for advancing bits of text to be read, for which the reading
time must be measured?  It seems to me that in the present state of affairs
the space bar is associated by default with items coded '0', i.e. items that
are not experimental, and that this association cannot be changed.

Any help much appreciated.
