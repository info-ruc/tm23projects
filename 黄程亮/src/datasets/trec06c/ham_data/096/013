      Second Call for Participation
      International Conference on Polynomial System Solving
      November 24-25-26, 2004
      Université Pierre et Marie Curie Paris, France
      in honor of Daniel Lazard
    +--------------------------------------------------------+


Daniel Lazard, Professor of Computer Science at Université Pierre et
Marie Curie, will retire at the end of the year 2004. This conference
will be held in honor of his many major contributions to computer
algebra, polynomial system solving, and applications. The program will
consist of invited talks and contributed presentations.


Scope
-----

Since the meeting is held in honor of Lazard's achievements, we
solicit research papers on topics related to Lazard's works and
interests, for instance: 

Algebraic resolution of polynomial systems Gröbner bases, triangular
sets, algebraic representation of solutions, specifications of
polynomial system solvers, practical and theoretical improvements,
efficient implementations, complexity, effective differential algebra,
...

Quantifier elimination and real solutions of polynomial systems

Algorithms for studying real solutions of polynomial systems in many
senses (number, topological invariants, ...), improvements of
cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD).

Effective Galois theory
Techniques improving the resolution of polynomial systems using
symmetries, computations in the field of effective Galois theory, ...

Applications
Resolution of polynomial systems arising in applications using
symbolic/numeric techniques: robotics, signal theory, cryptography,
statistics, ...


Publication
-----------

Accepted contributed papers (extended abstracts) will be published in
the proceedings that will be available at the meeting. After the
meeting the extended versions of the contributed papers will be
published in a special issue of the Journal of Symbolic Computation
after a standard journal refereeing procedure.
