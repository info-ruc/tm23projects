If you want text and graphics to be aligned vertically, I have found that in 
conjunction with using <xyjustification 1> in the parameter line and then 
specifying the position of both works the best.  For example:

+1  g "pic" <y 300> , "text" <y 300> ;

or if you want the text above the picture

+1  g "pic" <y 300> , "text" <y 200> ;

Subject: [DMDX] Displaying pictures and text on the screen - Centering issue


Hello everyone,

I am preparing a picture-word interference expt. where I have a picture 
appearing on the screen and at the same time a word above or below the 
picture. I want the word to appear always at the same distance from the 
centre of the picture whether above or below the picture.  I have tried with 
preceding the text of the word with the <ln - X> and <ln X > command, e.g. 
<ln 2> "return", <ln -2> "return". I am using the default, i.e. everything 
is displayed at the centre of the screen.

What I get is that when words are displayed above the picture the distance 
from the centre is much more  (approx 2 cm more) than when the words are 
displayed below the picture. Why is this happening?

I have noticed another thing. My screen is 30 cm high (measured with a 
tape). I have found out that when pictures are displayed their centre 
corresponds to the centre of the screen. However, when text is displayed  by 
default (i.e. not using the <line x> command in the script) the imaginary 
line along the bottom of the text (excluding letters that extend below like 
j and g)  is about 1/2 cm above the middle the screen (i.e. 14.5 cm from the 
top rather than 15 cm). How exactly is text centered by default?

Any help much appreciated
