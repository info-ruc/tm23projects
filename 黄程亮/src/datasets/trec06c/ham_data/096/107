Hello all

I am planning to set up an experiment that is something like the classic 
paradigm of shadowing: participants hear a word via headphones and they 
are asked to produce a word in response.

I have tried a DMDX script which seems to do the work. Basically it 
looks like that:

*<InputDevice DigitalVOX>*

*<InputDevice "RecordVocal" 1000>*

+121001 <ms% 500> "+" / *<wav 2> "mer" ;



I was wondering if any of you have conducted this type of experiment 
using DMDX. My potential concern is that the paradigm requires using the 
sound card both as output and input (I would like not only to get onset 
times for the responses with DigitalVox but also to record them using 
RecordVocal). How much processing cost does that double use induce? Is 
the resetting of the sound card fast enough that the use of input and 
output on a single trial does not produce serious RT variability? Etc.

Any thoughts on the issue would be wellcome

thanks a lot

 But I have no means to test in details what cost in time the double use 
of the card induces.
