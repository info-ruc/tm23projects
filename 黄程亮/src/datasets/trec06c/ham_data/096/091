Hello everyone, I was curious if there was a keyword
to stop a wav file from competing with a previous
frame.

+1 %30 "**"/ <wav 2> "ding"/ *"a_p_e";

In this example I would like the wav to continue into
the presentation of apple.  However, it is currently
competing with the **.  The ** stay on the screen as
long as the "ding" sound lasts plus the 30 ticks.  Is
there a manner by which to make the wav overlap the
target and not the pervious frame? I would like to use
ding to indicate to the subject to move on and press
enter.  thanks-tom
