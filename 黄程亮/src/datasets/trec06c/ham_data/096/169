Hi,

We are trying to install DMDX on a Dell Optiplex GX400 desktop (running
Windows NT), and we run the Sound Latency Test, we get the following
message:
 
"Signals strengths indicate this test is likely to fail, 0.19% ambient
should be much less than the 0.11% tone signal."  (naturally, the values change
everytime we run the test, but the message remains essentially the same). Does
anyone know how to fix this?

Thanks.

Paola (Giuli) Dussias
