   Perhaps you could select another Direct Sound Capture driver in 
TimeDX.  The one you maybe choosing may be summing a number of inputs 
whereas Praat maybe using something that's just using the MIC 
input.  Perhaps you need to make sure all other recording inputs are muted 
if changing the device doesn't get it.
