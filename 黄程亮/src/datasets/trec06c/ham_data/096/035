                    Technical Cyber Security Alert TA04-260A
                Microsoft Windows JPEG component buffer overflow

   Original release date: September 16, 2004
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT

Systems Affected

   This vulnerability affects the following Microsoft Windows operating
   systems by default:

     * Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 1
     * Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Service Pack 1
     * Microsoft Windows XP 64-Bit Edition Version 2003
     * Microsoft Windows Server 2003
     * Microsoft Windows Server 2003 64-Bit Edition

   Other Microsoft Windows operating systems, including systems running
   Microsoft Windows XP Service Pack 2, are not affected by default.
   However, this vulnerability may affect all versions of the Microsoft
   Windows operating systems if an application or update installs a
   vulnerable version of the gdiplus.dll file onto the system.

   Please note that this vulnerability affects any software that uses the
   Microsoft Windows operating system or Microsoft's GDI+ library to
   render JPEG graphics. Please see Systems Affected section of the
   vulnerability note to determine if third-party software is affected. A
   list of affected Microsoft products is available in Appendix B, or for
   the complete list of affected and non-affected Microsoft products,
   please see Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-028.

Overview

   Microsoft's Graphic Device Interface Plus (GDI+) contains a
   vulnerability in the processing of JPEG images. This vulnerability may
   allow attackers to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected
   system. Exploitation may occur as the result of viewing a malicious
   web site, reading an HTML-rendered email message, or opening a crafted
   JPEG image in any vulnerable application. The privileges gained by a
   remote attacker depend on the software component being attacked.

I. Description

   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-028 describes a remotely exploitable
   buffer overflow vulnerability in Microsoft's Graphic Device Interface
   Plus (GDI+) JPEG processing component. Attackers can exploit this
   vulnerability by convincing a victim user to visit a malicious web
   site, read an HTML-rendered email message, or otherwise view a crafted
   JPEG image with a vulnerable application. No user intervention is
   required beyond viewing an attacker-supplied JPEG image.

   Any applications (Microsoft or third-party) that use the GDI+ library
   to render JPEG images may present additional attack vectors for this
   vulnerability. While some applications use the Windows operating
   system version of the GDI+ library, other applications may install and
   use another version, which may also be vulnerable. Microsoft has
   created a GDI+ Detection Tool to help detect products that may contain
   a vulnerable version of the JPEG parsing component. Microsoft
   Knowledge Base Article 873374 provides instructions on how to download
   and use this tool.

   In addition to running Microsoft's detection utility, we recommend
   searching your system for "gdiplus.dll" to help determine what
   third-party applications may be affected by this vulnerability. Also
   note that applications may re-install a vulnerable version of the GDI+
   library if re-installed after a patch has been applied.

   We are tracking this vulnerability in Vulnerability Note VU#297462.
   This reference number corresponds to CVE candidate CAN-2004-0200.

II. Impact

   Remote attackers exploiting the vulnerability described above may
   execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
   software components being attacked.

III. Solution

  Apply patches from Microsoft

   Apply the appropriate patches as specified in Microsoft Security
   Bulletin MS04-028. Please note that this bulletin provides several
   updates to the operating system and various applications that rely on
   GDI+ to render JPEG images. Depending on your system's configuration,
   you may need to install multiple patches.

   In addition to releasing some patches on Windows Update, Microsoft has
   released some patches on Office Update, and developer tool patches are
   available from MS04-028.

  Apply patches from third-party vendors

   Third-party software that relies on GDI+ to render JPEG images may
   also need to be updated. Apply the appropriate patches specified by
   your vendor. Please see the your vendor's site and the Systems
   Affected section of the vulnerability note for more information.
   Depending on your system's configuration, you may need install
   multiple patches.

  Follow Microsoft recommendations for workarounds

   Microsoft provides several workarounds for this vulnerability. Note
   that these workarounds do not remove the vulnerability from the
   system, and they will limit functionality. Please consult the
   "Workarounds for JPEG Vulnerability - CAN-2004-0200" section of
   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS04-028.
