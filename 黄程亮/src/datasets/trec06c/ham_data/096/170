   If you don't want to use audio stuff ignore it.  Otherwise if you don't 
want to use an external pre-amplitfier for the microphone and using the 
sound card's LINE input instead of it's MIC input you'll have to think 
about a new sound card or new computer.  It's faintly possible that a 
better microphone or a powered one will fix the problem without an external 
pre-amplifier.  Personally I'm impressed the sound stuff works at all under 
NT to tell you the truth.
