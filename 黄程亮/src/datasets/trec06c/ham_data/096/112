Second R. E. Moore Prize to Be Awarded at SCAN'2004

Thomas C. Hales from the University of Pittsburgh will receive the 2nd
biannual R. E. Moore Prize for Applications of Interval Analysis, 
during the 11th GAMM-IMACS International Symposium on Scientific 
Computing, Computer Arithmetic, and Validated Numerics SCAN'2004 
(Fukuoka, Japan, October 4-8, 2004).

The R. E. Moore Prize was established in 2002 by the Editorial Board of 
Reliable Computing, an International Journal devoted to reliable
mathematical computations based on finite representations and
guaranteed accuracy.

The 2004 R. E. Moore Prize is awarded to Professor Thales for 
his solution of the Kepler conjecture about the densest arrangement 
of spheres in space. Dr. Hales solved this long-standing problem by 
using interval arithmetic. His preliminary results appeared in the 
Notices of the American Math Society in 2000; his full paper
"The Kepler Conjecture" will appear in Annals of Mathematics, 
one of the world leading journals in pure mathematics. 
The paper and the detailed proof can be obtained from the 
author's webpage www.math.pitt.edu/~thales

APPPENDIX
The R. E. Moore Prize for Applications of Interval Analysis: 
Description and Rationale 

The idea of arithmetic over sets to encompass finiteness, roundoff
error, and uncertainty dates back to the first part of the twentieth
century or earlier. By the late 1950's, with exponentially increasing
use of digital electronic computers for mathematical computations,
interval arithmetic was a concept whose time had come. With his 1962
dissertation "Interval Arithmetic and Automatic Error Analysis in
Digital Computing," encouraged by George Forsythe, Prof. Ramon Moore
was one of the first to publicize the underlying principles of
interval arithmetic in their modern form. Prof. Moore subsequently
dedicated much of his life to furthering the subject. This includes
guidance of seven Ph.D. students, interaction with other prominent
figures in the area such as Eldon Hansen, Louis Rall, and Bill
Walster, and publication of the seminal work "Interval Analysis"
(Prentice Hall, 1966) and its update "Methods and Applications of
Interval Analysis" (SIAM, 1979). In addition, Prof. Moore published a
related book "Computational Functional Analysis" (Horwood, 1985), and
organized the conference with proceedings Reliability in Computing
(Academic Press, 1988). This latter conference was a major catalyst
for renewed interest in the subject. It is safe to say that these
accomplishments of Professor Moore have made interval analysis what it
is today. To continue and further this tradition, in 2002, we decided
to dedicate to Prof. Moore a biennial prize for the best dissertation
or paper in applications of interval analysis. 

Note:  By "applications" we intend primarily applications in
engineering and the sciences that will bring further recognition to
the power of interval computations. However, we do not wish to  rule
out significant and widely recognized "pure" applications. The
editorial board of the journal "Reliable Computing"  will judge this.
