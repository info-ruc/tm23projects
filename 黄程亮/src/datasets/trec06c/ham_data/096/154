Quick scrambling question for you, folks...

Say I have a block size parameter of 6, but 20 items in my script, what 
happens? Does DMDX take the first 18 items and divide them into 3 blocks 
of 6, and then treat the remaining 2 items as a block in its own right?

Looking at my scrambled.itm file, this would appear to be the case, but 
I'd appreciate confirmation from anyone who knows...

Thanks!
Stuart.
