Dear Andrea et al.,

very well. Considering how attractive many of the fundamental properties of
validated methods are, there is sometimes a tendency to lose sight of the
connection to the practical problem at hand, and get absorbed by the
appealing and often challenging algorithmic questions. I have observed it
often myself, and found it important to always try to remind me what the
specific question to be solved was; at least that's what my funding agencies
always seem to be concerned about :-)

In any case, please enjoy the discussion, let's hope we all learn something
from it, and it will lead to viable tools for the problems you may wish to
solve. And once you have more specific ideas what test or real problems you
are interested in, at least I personally would be interested in them.

Best wishes,

Martin

  Dear all,


  just to answer to the message from Martin Berz : I do not have a test
problem as yet.  I actually wrote to the list since I am at a preliminary
stage (thinking of a project and surveying interesting methods) and aware of
part of the literature on interval methods but also looking for further
relevant references.  I had read the section on integers in Hansen's book
but I was wondering whether there were further publications and, also,
published work on practical experiences.


  So I guess the way the discussion has developed, referring to (mixed)
integer programming in general, is the kind of response I was hoping to read
(and, by the way, many thanks to all those who posted contributions).


  Andrea Rosa
