   The card doesn't get reset, it simply does both recording and playing at 
the same time, full duplex as the technical lingo goes.

   It should be ok, most sound cards these days have no trouble with full 
duplex data and most of the time that you are using RecordVocal the sound 
card is already doing full duplex transfers as the rest of the machine 
might be outputting a sound as DMDX is recording one.
