Hello again

thanks for the previous response!

here's another one: on my dell desktop i am using record vocal to get
soundfiles at each subject's response (e.g. in picture naming). I get the
recordings all right but they have background static noise (or something
like that) around 47 dB. Now, if I switch off dmdx and record sound with
another program (in this case : www.praat.org) then the recording is much
better and i get background noise around an acceptable 30 dB.

Any idea of why this could be so...? Of course I d love to have dmdx
recording with the low background noise

thanks again for your help

ciao

xavier
