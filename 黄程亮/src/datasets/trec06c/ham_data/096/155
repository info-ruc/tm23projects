Dear all,

there will be a session on Taylor Models and Interval Arithmetic
(organized by myself) at the 17th IMACS World Congress, which takes
place in Paris, France, July 11-15, 2005.


Further information can be found at the conference website:

http://imacs2005.ec-lille.fr/index.php


The "and" in the session title is meant as a mathematical "or". Talks on 
Taylor model methods and talks on traditional interval methods are 
equally welcome. Please note that the deadline for submitting draft 
papers is October, 15.

Best regards,

Markus Neher
