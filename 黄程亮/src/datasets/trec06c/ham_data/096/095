Hi,

I've recently started a job in Sweden, and, not surprisingly, the computers there are set up in Swedish.  When I try to run my DMDX programs (which run perfectly fine on US language machines), my programs don't run.  Possibly because things have different names.  For example, DMDX didn't understand "keyboard" as an input id, because here it is called "tangentbord".  Those are relatively easy to remedy, but after I did that, I was getting error messages for other things (like the name for shift keys etc), which is all very annoying.

Is there a relatively easy remedy for this?  I couldn't find any quick references to it in the past list-serve messages, or in the help text, though I know that there are people outside english speaking countries using DMDX, so the answer must be out there.

Thanks.

Åse
