Dear Dr.Wang,

First, I am sorry if this report came late for couple days.. Actually because 
of our trip and also I was fixing some previous technical issues.

For the past days till now, I have worked on:
 - Adding new questions for the Assessments.
 - Testing the Import/Export capabilities, fixing some small mistakes and 
redesigning some related issues.
 
I have Also Added a new link called 'Process/Display' for each teacher's 
Assessment so that the teacher can choose one of three display options (By):
 1) A given order only, OR
 2) All questions/options are in Random order, OR
 3) Random questions, Non-Random options.
I am have away of finishing the 3rd option.

So, I am working on these different display options, and then I will save the 
the student's name, All answers, etc. in the database for each student so that 
these info. can be retrieved and used later for statistical purposes and 
giving an advice for the teacher..

So hopefully I will get some work done by next week in the next report.

Thank you,
Saleh Al-shomrani.
