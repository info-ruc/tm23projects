Hello everyone,

I am preparing a picture-word interference expt. where I have a picture =
appearing on the screen and at the same time a word above or below the =
picture. I want the word to appear always at the same distance from the =
centre of the picture whether above or below the picture.  I have tried =
with preceding the text of the word with the <ln - X> and <ln X > =
command, e.g.  <ln 2> "return", <ln -2> "return". I am using the =
default, i.e. everything is displayed at the centre of the screen.=20

What I get is that when words are displayed above the picture the =
distance from the centre is much more  (approx 2 cm more) than when the =
words are displayed below the picture. Why is this happening?

I have noticed another thing. My screen is 30 cm high (measured with a =
tape). I have found out that when pictures are displayed their centre =
corresponds to the centre of the screen. However, when text is displayed =
 by default (i.e. not using the <line x> command in the script) the =
imaginary line along the bottom of the text (excluding letters that =
extend below like j and g)  is about 1/2 cm above the middle the screen =
(i.e. 14.5 cm from the top rather than 15 cm). How exactly is text =
centered by default?=20

Any help much appreciated
