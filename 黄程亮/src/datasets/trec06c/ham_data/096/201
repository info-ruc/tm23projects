Subject: Formal Methods at IMACS World Congress in Paris

                       CALL FOR PAPERS
            Formal Methods in Applied Mathematics
                        Paris, France 
                    July 11th-15th,  2005
                       CALL FOR PAPERS

TOPICS

Formal   proof assistants are  used  to  guarantee the correctness  of
simple   algorithms and programs in  computer   arithmetic and soon in
numerical analysis.    This  session  is intended  to   bring together
researchers interested  in mechanically proving properties of floating
point  operators and numerical  algorithms.  It  will also foster  the
development of floating point  and other arithmetic packages for proof
assistants.  It  will finally    present applications  and   introduce
challenging problems and perspectives for the future.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to: 

       Certifications of floating point operators 
       Ensuring properties of numerical algorithms 
       Formalizations of IEEE 754/854 and IEC 559 standards
       Identification of future key applications

HISTORY

A first meeting was  held in Lyon,  France, in 2000, funded by INRIA's
ARC AOC.  The  workshop  was a success  bringing  together specialists
that usually present  their results to  separate communities. From now
on, we propose to organize  this meeting as a  session of IMACS  World
Congress.    This will  help  us   bridge  the  gap  between  maturing
applications in  computer  arithmetic  and the first  applications  in
numerical analysis.

SUBMISSION

Researchers interested in presenting their work  are invited to submit
a very  first 1-4 page abstract  to the following  web site indicating
the "Formal  methods" session in  "Applied mathematics".  They will be
allowed to update their abstract for one month.

http://imacs2005.ec-lille.fr/

Updated abstracts will  be peer-reviewed to  assess their relevance to
the session. Accepted authors will send a full paper  to appear in the
proceedings of the conference.
