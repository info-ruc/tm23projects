Hi,

I have just designed a multiple response experiment and have had a 
four-button response box made to go with it.  I have previously used a 
two-button response box mapping the responses to Bit1 and Bit2.  I 
assumed that I would be able to do the same using responses Bit1, Bit2, 
Bit3 and Bit4, however, only the Bit1 and Bit2 responses work.  When I 
do the timedx pio test the buttons correspond to 1, 2, 3 and 4 are 
activated respectively.  Also the experiment works fine if I use four 
keyboard buttons.  Was I wrong to assume that I could map these 4 buttons?

Also a separate but related enquiry: is it possible to map a positive or 
negative response and a request response to the same button?

Thanks in advance,
Best wishes,

Rebecca
