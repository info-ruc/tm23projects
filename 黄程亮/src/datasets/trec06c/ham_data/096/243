Dear Friends, 

A few days ago, we had a 11th GAMM-IMACS International
Symposium on Scientific Computing, Computer Arithmetic, and Validated
Numerics SCAN'2004 in Fukuoka, Japan. This was the first 
SCAN meeting outside Europe. It was a very productive, 
very successful, and a very well organized meeting. 

Many thanks to the organizers, especially to 
the Conference Chair Professor Mitsuhiro T. Nakao! 

The next SCAN meeting will be held in Duisburg, Germany,
in October 2006. The Conference Chair for SCAN'06 is 
Professor Wolfram Luther from the University of Essen-Duisburg. 

The 2008 SCAN meeting is scheduled to be in El Paso, Texas. 

Thanks again.

Vladik
