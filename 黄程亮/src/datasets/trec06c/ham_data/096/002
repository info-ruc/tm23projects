Hi, To be frank after attempting to use atoizilliontext and branchif etc, I am still not able to get a program to work.  I think it is my failure to understand where and what to insert into <atoizilliontext> as well as any expression using branchif.  I would immensely appreciate a brief demo of the code I am trying to use.  Again it is a target id experiment where the subject types a word in and the subject receives a "correct" or incorrect response.  I appreciate anyone's help in this endeavor
-thank you
   tom

It's atoizilliontext, AsciiTOInteger, which is an ancient C 
acronym. And it's not in the regular documentation because it isn't a 
keyword, it's a token in an expression so you need to look at the 
keyword. That or use the search function in the help but then 
of course you'd have to have known the correct spelling ;)

Yep, that's the idea. Load a counter with it and then branch on the 
counter's value or use 
and branch on an expression that compares 
atoizilliontext with a constant, no counters needed.

There's an old proverb that says just about whatever you want it to.
