I did find it, finally (the references).

Looks like I can't use the left and right shift keys though, because I can't get DMDX to recognize the swedish names (which are vänster skift och höger skift, and I'm wondering if I have issues with the extra letters.  It does fine with mapping keys that don't have the å ä ö in it, like the spacebar).
