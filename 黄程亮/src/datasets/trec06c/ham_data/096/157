Funny!  How true.  That reminds me (this is a bit off-topic) of
another interesting contrast.  I call it "logical implication" vs.
"causal implication".  The following code example may help illiminate.

    if (A) then
	x := 1
    else
	x := 0
    end if

Most people would read this as

    "if A is true then x becomes 1",

which some people may also also read as

    "A implies x=1",

or ever more briefly,

    "A => (x=1)"

But from a logical standpoint, it's actually the other way around.
After the "if" statement has executed, then we know for sure that
if x=1, then A was true, and if x=0, then A was false.  That is,

    (x=1) => A

I call the former "causal implication", while the latter is "logical
implication". The latter is how us formal folks are supposed to think.  :-)
But it confused the hell out of me when I learned it as an undergrad.
