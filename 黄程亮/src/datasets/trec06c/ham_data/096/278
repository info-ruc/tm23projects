   The PIO has an additional level of customization that masks out bits 
that aren't used, the MIP word.  You need <mip 36>.  You'll also want to 
have <umtp> and <umvk> in the parameter line after the <id qpio12> as the 
tape pulse by default is bit 3 and the voice key bit 4 -- when I construct 
extra button response boxes I usually use bits 5 and 6 to avoid having to 
unmap those responses.  Not that this usually causes problems as any 
positive or negative mappings will take precedence but it's safer than sorry.

   No.  You can do it but only the first button found will generate a 
response (which is why you could get away without <umtp> and 
<umvk>).  While I admit this would solve some problems it also stands a 
significant chance of creating several others and due to race conditions 
not actually solving the problem in any event (for instance DMDX is usually 
not ready to receive a request within microseconds of a response).  Each 
time I've been confronted with a task that's looked like it's needed that 
sort of solution there have been other ways of doing it and I'm always 
happy to suggest solutions here.
