                                    ISIPTA '05
             4th International Symposium on Imprecise Probabilities
                             and Their Applications
                          Preliminary Call for Papers

                                July 20-23, 2005
                           Carnegie Mellon University
                          Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ISIPTA meetings are one of the primary international forums to
present and discuss new results on the theory and applications of
imprecise probabilities. Imprecise probability has a wide scope, being
a generic term for the many mathematical or statistical models which
measure chance or uncertainty without sharp numerical
probabilities. These models include belief functions, Choquet
capacities, comparative probability orderings, convex sets of
probability measures, fuzzy measures, interval-valued probabilities,
possibility measures, plausibility measures, and upper and lower
expectations or previsions. Imprecise probability models are needed in
inference problems where the relevant information is scarce, vague or
conflicting, and in decision problems where preferences may also be
incomplete.

Themes of the symposium
-----------------------

Although the symposium will be open to contributions on all
aspects of imprecise probability, three main themes will be
emphasised: decision-making, algorithms, and real applications.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

models of coherent imprecise assessments
convex sets of probability measures (credal sets)
interval-valued probabilities
upper and lower expectations or previsions
non-additive set functions, and in particular Choquet
     capacities (and Choquet integration), fuzzy measures,
     possibility measures, belief and plausibility measures
random sets
rough sets
comparative probability orderings
qualitative reasoning about uncertainty
imprecision in utilities and expected utilities
limit laws for imprecise probabilities
physical models of imprecise probability
philosophical foundations for imprecise probabilities
psychological models for imprecision and indeterminacy
     in probability assessments
elicitation techniques for imprecise probabilities
robust statistics
probabilistic bounding analysis
data mining with imprecise probabilities/missing data
estimation and learning of imprecise probability models
decision making with imprecise probabilities
ambiguity aversion and economic models of imprecise probability
uncertainty in financial markets
algorithms for manipulating imprecise probabilities
Dempster-Shafer theory
information algebras and probabilistic argumentation systems
probabilistic logic, propositional and first-order
credal networks and other graphical models
credal classification
applications in statistics, economics, finance,
          management, engineering, computer science
          and artificial intelligence, psychology,
          philosophy and related fields

Workshop on Financial Risk Assessment

There will be a workshop addendum to the conference,
to be held on July 24, with invited speakers on the topic
