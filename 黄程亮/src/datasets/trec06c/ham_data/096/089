   No, no one has wanted that before.  If you are going to have limited 
range of timeout values you'll have to use an indexed call that branches on 
a counter's value to one of a number of items that each set the timeout to 
a different value and return.  Or step up to become a member of the elite 
group that sponsor changes to DMDX of course ;)
