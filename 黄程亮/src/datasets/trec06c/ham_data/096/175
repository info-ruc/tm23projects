A few weeks ago I posted a question to the list serve on whether time out 
switches can take a counter as a value rather than an integer value. I was 
informed that in DMDX's current form, time out switches cannot take a 
counter as a value, but that I could sponsor a change to DMDX so that it 
could perform this function. If this is still an option, I would like to 
sponsor this change.

Also, assuming that this change to DMDX is made, it is my understanding 
that the response time value assigned to any specific trial on which no 
response is made will be set to the value of the time out for that specific 
trial. Is that true?

Jonathan, could you contact me so we can arrange me sponsoring a change to 
DMDX. You can send me an e-mail, or call me at 608-262-5605.

Thanks!


Robin
