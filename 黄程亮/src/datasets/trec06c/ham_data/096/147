I have just started using DMDX and am trying to create a masked priming experiment in which the target is shown until the subject responds. However, although responses seem to be recognised fine in the output file, neither the instructions nor the words go away after I have pressed the corresponding button. Instead, they remain on the screen for a set time. I have also been trying to use the delay parameter to put a delay in between the instructions and the task as well as between individual items in the task but no delay occurs. At the moment a sample of my experiment looks like this:

<n 60> <fd 1000> <id keyboard> <cr> <d 200> <s 60> <nfb>
$
0 	<ln -2> "Press the right shift key if it is a word”,
        <ln –1> “and the left shift key if it is not",
    	<ln 3> "Press the space bar to start";
$
+1 <% 100>“+” / <% 2> / <% 48>”###########” / <% 4>”CARROT” / <% 2> / <*>”wortel”;
+2 <% 100>“+” / <% 2> / <% 48>”###########” / <% 4>”CAT” / <% 2> / <*>”poes”;
+3 <% 100>“+” / <% 2> / <% 48>”###########” / <% 4>”COAT” / <% 2> / <*>”jas”;

What have I done wrong?
