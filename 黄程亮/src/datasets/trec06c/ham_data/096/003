Dear Friends, This is FYI. FUZZ-IEEE is a major IEEE conference on fuzzy 
systems that usually has a reasonably large interval presence.

Vladik,

We are happy to inform you that we have accepted your proposal for a
special session on "Relation between fuzzy and interval techniques".

The papers will be due on Nov. 1, along with the regular papers.

Thanks for helping out with FUZZIEEE 2005.
