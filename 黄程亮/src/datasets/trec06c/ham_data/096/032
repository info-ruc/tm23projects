The likely source of elevated seismic noise is the new IDF (Integrated Disposal Facility) 
which has begun it's excavation phase recently. This facility is a trench much like the 
ERDF (Environmental Restoration Disposal Facility) but is several kilometers closer
to the LHO X-ARM. I have been told that serious earth moving was started several weeks 
ago and will likely continue to mid December with 1.2 million cu yds of material to remove. 
The finished trenches will take glass logs from the VIT plant. The trenches will be excavated 
to a depth of about 50 feet and lined with clay and plastic. The excavated material is 
maintained next to the site so that it can be spread back over the trenches as needed. 
A small amount of clay material and rock will be brought in from other locations - this 
will result in highway traffic.

I have put a detailed construction schedule in plant mail to you.  If you
don't get in the near future send me an e-mail and I can put one in the mail
to you.

I have attached several facility drawings and a scope of construction work
(SOW 1010 Summary of Work file).

I will get more information on number and capacity of equipment this
afternoon and send it to you tomorrow.
