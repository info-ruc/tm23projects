Hi David

I installed two of these CPUs last weekend, one went into a system 
with a VLB SCSI controller and is being run at 160MHz, the other went 
into a system with a VLB Enhanced IDE controller and is being run at 
133MHz.  Both systems have ASUS GX4 motherboards.

I couldn't get write-back to work with *either* system, I don't know 
what I did wrong there, could have been a CMOS setting or something.

On the 133Mhz system I have <33MHz, 0ws, and on the 160MHz system I 
have >33MHz, 1ws.

Mine does the same, and for the 133MHz system it says 120MHz.
We'll have to wait for BIOS 0402 (if there will be one) to fix that, 
I don't think its serious, I think ASUS just round off the calculated 
MHz value to one of the known speeds.

Yes, I also downloaded mine from ASUS, it is just a binary image.
Just load it in as binary and dump it onto a blank 27C512.

I would like to know how you get on.  I am interested in comparing 
benchmarks.  Norton SI 8, and VGABench.  Also I'd like to get it 
running in Write Back mode.  I have the data sheet for the 5x86, I'm 
planning on studying it and tracing out to what pins the jumpers go,
and hopefully from that information we can work out the best jumper 
settings.  I have a suspicion it can go faster.

Cheers
