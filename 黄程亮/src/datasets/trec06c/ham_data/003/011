Voting for the comp.os.plan9 newsgroup should start in a day or two; I've
heard from the votetaker, who has the Call For Votes ready to go. 

I hope everybody interested in seeing a plan9 newsgroup will vote for this
proposal.  During the discussion period on Usenet, no one objected to the
concept but some questioned the need to moderate the group.  A couple of
people from this list defended that need (quite well, I thought) -- still
there may be some people who won't vote for a moderated group, and even
some who may vote against it. 

A failed newsgroup proposal can't be brought up again for a vote for 6
months, so if you want to see a plan9 newsgroup soon it's important that
you vote for this proposal! 

The votetaker will send the Call For Votes to this mailing list after it
is posted on Usenet; it'll have the voting instructions.
