Dear ccollaborators, 
			I placed a new version of the proposed Phys. Rev. D 
for rho and rho' studies on FNALV , in CMS_ROOT:[PAPERS]rho_prime_v2.ps. 
These includes the comments made by G. Condo and Tom Handler. In addition, 
in light of the memo written as few weeks ago, I propose to drop the figure 9 
from this paper, and the coresponding paragraphe in the text. (I made the 
change, but the ReVTex broke down on my workstation, so for now, simply 
ignore the paragraphe where that figure is introduced.). 

	This paper is progressing at a glacial pace, but may be it will get there. 
Also, frankly, I think we have better now:  the phi-phi and the phi-f0(980) 
studies looks more appealing to me. In that spirit, I wrote a memo describing 
the anomalous behavior of the f0(980) with respect to other resonances. This 
is memo is available in CMS_ROOT:[DOCUMENTS]f0980_phi.ps.  May be I am making 
too much of this stuff, but I would like to stress that it has been known for 
a long time that this resonance does not fit well in the standard $q \bar{q}$ 
classification for light quark spectroscopy, any information how this state 
gets produced is I think relevant. The clue on hidden strangeness might be a 
serious indicator. 

	However, we also have to convince the community that we know what we are 
doing in this field, so boring paper on "normal" resonance are also of 
interest.  I'll certainly welcome ideas, suggestions... 

							Paul.
