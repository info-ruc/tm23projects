Dear collaborators,

	the next E831 meeting will be held in the Hornet's nest (11th floor)
and will begin tomorrow, Friday Oct 4, at 9 AM.
Here following are listed the requests for talks I have received so far.

See you soon

 name: Kevin Stenson
 topic: Beam Tagging System
 estimated time: 15 minutes
 special requirements: None
 
<<<<< ABSTRACT FOR CMS VERSION OF AGENDA>>>>>

 I will show the beam tagging system is working as designed.
 I will also point out some of the limitations of the system
 at our current/projected intensity.
 
 ----------------------------------------------
name:	Peter H. Garbincius
topic:	Beam Calorimetry (RESH,POSH,BGM) status and operational experience
time est:  10-15 minutes

<<<<< ABSTRACT FOR CMS VERSION OF AGENDA>>>>>

	To first order almost everything is working, checked out, gain set,
and timed (except for the RESH-11 and POSH-11 which have recently been 
installed but not yet commissioned, likewise for the ion chambers in 
BGM, RESH-0, POSH-0).

	I am definitely not satisfied with the operation of lots of this stuff,
mainly due to signal quality problems:  60/180 Hz noise, drive capability of
the RESH/POSH discriminators (easy fix, but I need stable beam to test and
verify), width of analog pulses to ADCs due to cable dispersion (Sten Hansen
will try the E-835 module fix during next week's accelerator hiatus), baseline
shifts (especially for RESH0, POSH0, BGM) due to the isolation transformer (AC)
coupling, and some bizzare behavior of the LRS 1881 FB ADCs when run at short
18 nsec gate.  All of these problems arise due to my attempt to run at the
full 53 MHz accelerator RF bucket timing.

	MONDA programming is still not implemented.

<<<<< ABSTRACT FOR CMS VERSION OF AGENDA>>>>>

The status of straw software will be discussed, including the
preliminary tracking efficiencies and residuals.  Options for preparing
the spares will be presented including motivation, or lack there of.

Name    : Fabiola  (Hector and John Cumalat)
Topics   : Hxv geometry and efficiency
Estimated time : 10 minutes
Special requirement: Before noon friday (baby constrain)

<<< Abstract >>>

A preliminary HxV's geometry and efficiency measurement will be presented.
The reconstructed counter's size, (x,y) position and semiplane gap are
compared with "our own" survey done at the pit during the last shutdown.
In order to avoid share hits; a fiducial cut is applied on each counter to
calculate the efficiency. Also, the noise ratio for each counter will be
presented.
   In order to "illuminated" the whole H and V planes, we called the
routine P1P2P4 from the tracking library. During the normal reconstruction
procedure (without calling P1P2P4) we don't reconstruct the edge of the
counters, neither the 4 counter in the bottom (H1,H2,H13,H14) and the 4 in
the top (H11,H12,H23,H24).
   The number presented in this talk are extracted from a special muon
beam run for OE, where the trigger was:
         AM * AMD * (IM1 + OM1)
A study of OH and Master Gate efficiency will follow.

 name: Harry Cheung
 topic: Status of the trigger
 estimated time: 20 mins
 special requirements: after 2pm and before 7pm on friday as
   I'm on shift 8pm-4am on thursday and friday
 
 <<<<< ABSTRACT FOR CMS VERSION OF AGENDA>>>>>

 Status of Master Gate and 2nd Level trigger will
 be reviewed. Work still to be done will be discussed.

name:Jeff Wilson
topic: Alignment Issues: Multiple scattering can cause systematic 
alignment problems.
estimated time: 10 min.
special requirements: Between 10:30am -5:00pm

<<<<< ABSTRACT FOR CMS VERSION OF AGENDA>>>>>

Using a simple model of the silicon system with multiple scattering 
included I show that incorrect wire spacing adjustments
are necessary to get good alignment.  My suggestion is to check our 
"real life" alignment  package on Monte Carlo to gauge the severity of
this problem.

name:Jeff Wilson
topic: Status of the software packages that I am familiar with:
mainly unpacking, tracking, magnetic field, vees, and fitting.
estimated time: 15 min.
special requirements: Between 10:30am -5:00pm

<<<<< ABSTRACT FOR CMS VERSION OF AGENDA>>>>>

Most of the software used in E687 "just works" for FOCUS.  However,
there is a lot of work to be done in alignment, recalculation of many
parameters used in vertexing and fitting and reevaluation of the 
software for old features we never bothered to change.  There are 
also Data quality issues that need to be studied now while we can still 
fix things.

name: Silvano Sala
topic: my understanding about beam and hits in ustrips
time: 20 min. 

<<<<< ABSTRACT FOR CMS VERSION OF AGENDA>>>>>

a study of correlations about beam setting and hit's
multiplicity in ustrip and a few suggestions to improve
the quality of our data.

including a brief discussion of the hardware,
software, and plans for further development.
