<H2>Requesting Labels Separately </H2>

<P>
PICS labels can also be retrieved separately from the documents
to which they refer. To request labels in this way, a client contacts a 
a <B>label bureau</B>.  A label bureau is an HTTP server that understands
a particular query syntax, defined below. It can provide labels for
documents that reside on other servers, and, indeed, for documents available
through protocols other than http. It is anticipated that there
will be &quot;well-known&quot; label bureaus which dispense (possibly for a
fee) labels created by many label services.

<P>
Label services are also encouraged to act as label bureaus, providing
on-line access to their own labels. By default, the URL that identifies a
label service also identifies its label bureau.  If a client requests the
URL that identifies a rating service, a human-readable description of the
service is returned. If, on the other hand, a client requests the same URL
and includes query parameters as defined below, it should be interpreted as
a request for labels. A label service, however, is not required to act as a
label bureau, and it may choose a different URL (perhaps even on a different
HTTP server) to act as its label bureau.
