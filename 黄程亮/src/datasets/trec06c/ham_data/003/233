This is what I was going to guess too.

Subject: commercial vs. free CU-SeeMe software

How many people are using the commercial version of CU-SeeMe, and how many
people are using the free version?  What are the limitations of the free
version?  For one thing, I believe the free version does not have the
"whiteboard" function, which allows both parties to share a writing space.
Does anyone know any other differences?
