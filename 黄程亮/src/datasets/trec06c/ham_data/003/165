Don't know about the scuzzy card.  I definately get worst performance using
write back L2 cache setting in windows.  Didn't test dos.  I have the 401
bios and all of my previous settings have turned out to be optimal.  Every
other change is for the worst, including the jumper settings.  I have power
saving features that I didnt have with the 306 bios so that means that the
401 has made this chip and my system more compatable.  With the 401, I'm
also able to vary the cpu modes,(write thru and write back) although I saw
no difference withnthe 306.  I get a drasticly worse cpu mark when I go to
write thru in the cmos setup.  I'm positive it's operating in write back
mode as indicated by my benchmark prog, and to my surprise there are no
glitches.

Good luck!
