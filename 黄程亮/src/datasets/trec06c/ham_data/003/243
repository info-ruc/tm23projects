Has something happened to the reflector at sunsite.berkeley.edu? I 
couldn't connect either monday nor tuesday. And vega.lib.ncsu.edu seems 
empty most of the time, too...

Lori: if you need a low-cost alternative camera, that you'll only use for 
Cu-SeeMe, try the Connectix B/W Quickcam, which retails for around $80 (mac 
and PC versions available). There's also a Color version, which costs 
about twice as much.

Try:

         http://www.connectix.com/

Greets!

Does anyone on the listserv use a Mac Powerbook 5300cs? If so, can you tell
me if CuSeeMe works for you.  Thanks.
