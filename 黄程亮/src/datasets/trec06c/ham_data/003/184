AUTODESK AND NETSCAPE TO EXTEND INTERNET
     AS PLATFORM FOR DESIGN AND ENGINEERING
                          COLLABORATION 
<pre>
      COMPANIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO TRANSFORM THE
    INTERNET INTO A VIRTUAL ENGINEERING ENVIRONMENT FOR
                       DESIGNERS AND ENGINEERS

NEW YORK (April 10, 1996) -- Autodesk, Inc. and Netscape Communications
Corporation today announced they will work together to extend the Internet
into a virtual engineering environment where designers and engineers can use
Netscape and Autodesk software to collaborate. The companies are united
behind the new DWF file format developed by Autodesk as a standard for
viewing and publishing 2D vector graphics, such as design drawings, diagrams
and technical illustrations. The DWF file format and the WHIP! Plug-In for
Netscape Navigator client software let users view design data efficiently
over the Internet. The combination of the WHIP! technology and Netscape
Navigator Gold and Netscape Enterprise Server software provide many of the
tools necessary for design and engineering professionals to collaborate,
publish and manage design data over the Internet. 
<pre>
With Netscape Navigator Gold's easy-to-use Internet publishing capabilities
and the WHIP! technology, design and engineering professionals can embed
design data into their HTML pages. Netscape Enterprise Server is the first
Internet server software to support Java and JavaScript, enabling the
creation, delivery and management of live, online applications and content
on enterprise networks and the Internet. 
<pre>
"By creating this technology for designers and engineers, Autodesk and
Netscape will help eliminate the communication barriers between engineers,
architects and other design professionals and increase the use of shared
digital designs," said Carol Bartz, Autodesk chairman, president and CEO.
"Our work with Netscape will enable Autodesk's design software users to
collaborate more easily with other users, as well as share their work with
their clients in an inexpensive, timely fashion." 
<pre>
"Autodesk's new Plug-ins are very complimentary to the work Netscape has
done in Internet publishing," said Mike Homer, vice president of marketing
at Netscape. "The virtual engineering file format will improve the use of
the Internet as a platform in business-to-business engineering and design
applications and increase the utility of the Intranet for corporate
communications, collaboration and data access.  Together we will bring to
light the millions of existing designs and engineering documents created in
detailed design format that previously were stored on inaccessible internal
LAN servers." 
<pre>
Except for the historical information contained herein, the matters
discussed in this news release are forward-looking statements that involve
risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially
from those projected. These include the timely development and acceptance of
new products, the impact of competitive products and pricing, and the other
risks detailed from time to time in SEC reports, including the report in
Form 10-Q filed in December 1995.
