David, 

        I tried 1/4 clkin again and once again showed a degradation in CPU
16 and 32 marks.  Increases with 1/5 clkin.  I read somewhere that the 133
works optimally with an 8 Mhz ISA bus speed and with a 33Mhz input.  If I
find it again I will get it to you.  
        I also went back to transparent at 160 and video still froze during
benchmark.  Suspect it's just my older bios and will retest it tuesday when
the new one gets here.
        All other settings seem to be optimal as each time I change them,
performance somewhere gets worse or the system doesn't boot.
        I also found that my power saving features don't work.  I'm sure
it's a jumper setting for the chip and will let you know what I find out.
Might be til after I get the new bios to see if it still doesn't work.

Keep in touch, I think we're making good progress!

John





John,







Thanx for the reply David,

        My system works all the way up to 1/3 clkin, at that point the CD
Rom is no longer recognized at Win 95 Bootup. I stayed at 1/5 for
reliability.  I'll boost it to 1/4 and for a while to ensure theres
reliability and a performance increase.
        I don't understand what you mean for the video cache.  My system
runs slower with cache enabled.  
        As for the synchronize/transparent setting, at 133Mhz I'm able to
run transparent.  This setting allows the system to exchange data with the
local bus immediately, vice waiting for the next clock pulse as in
synchronize.  My video, probably due to some other misadjustment in my
setup, freezes while benching when the setting is at transparent at 160Mhz.
Tranparent at 133Mhz increases performance.  Synchronize at 160Mhz ensures
reliabilty in my system.  Look for a difference using both settings at
160Mhz and let me know what you came up with. If it works for you, I've got
to dig a little deeper and find out what I missed.  I'm still playing around
so I'll keep intouch.  Did you get my latest e-mail on the 29th?

John
