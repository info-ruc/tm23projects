The CANADIAN GEOMORPHOLOGY RESEARCH GROUP is sponsoring two special
sessions in conjunction with the CANADIAN ASSOCIATION OF GEOGRAPHERS (CAG)
1996 Annual Meeting in Saskatoon, May 11-16.

GLOBAL CHANGE IN THE PALLISER TRIANGLE: LESSONS FROM THE PAST TO PREPARE
FOR AN UNCERTAIN FUTURE

     An applied perspective to geomorphic research examining the physical
impacts of climate change in the southern Canadian prairies.  GCM
predictions of increased warming and decreased precipitation over the
northern Great Plains give rise to concerns about the viability of
sustainable agriculture in the region.  Presentations will include new
Holocene paleoclimatic records as well as studies of geomorphic processes,
geomorphic response to climatic variability, and GIS evaluation of
landscape sensitivity for land use management issues.  The session
represents the final meeting of the Geological Survey of Canada coordinated
Palliser Triangle IRMA, but encourages contributions from persons not
formally associated with that project.


AEOLIAN SESSION

     Aeolian research is a growing field in Canada and abroad, with issues
related to global change and sustainable activities providing an
increasingly applied backdrop for this research.  Much of this research
focusses on processes, dealing with the common issues such as mechanisms
limiting sediment supply (including moisture, vegetation, fire, crusting,
ice or snow) and how these effect both processes and morphology. This
session will provide an opportunity to present recent and on-going research
on aeolian processes and paleoenvironmental interpretations in both Canada
and internationally.  The session will be structured to ensure that there
will be ample time for discussion and open debate.


Field Trip

     A 3 1/2 day pre-meeting field trip related to both of the CGRG
sponsored sessions is planned for May 9-12.  The trip will take
participants through the semi-arid core of the Palliser Triangle and across
the Cypress Hills, a forested oasis in the middle of the prairies.  Stops
will discuss Tertiary and Pleistocene geomorphology, with emphasis on
Holocene paleoenvironmental records and geomorphic processes.  Highlights
include visits to the Great Sand Hills, Killdeer Badlands (Grasslands
National Park), unglaciated terrains, the St. Victor Petroglyphs and fine
dining at the Spring Valley Guest Ranch.  For aeolian researchers, it will
be an excellent opportunity to observe active parabolic dunes, cliff-top
dunes and loess deposits.  Number of participants will be limited.


First Circular will be distributed by the CAG in December.  To ensure you
receive a circular, please contact Alec Aitken.  If you are interested in
contributing a paper or a poster to either session, please contact either
Don Lemmen or Steve Wolfe.
