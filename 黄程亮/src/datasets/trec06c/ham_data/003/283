DEAR FRIEND, 
I AM DR, JAN DE VOS THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION 
OF AFRICAN MERCHANT BANK SOUTH AFRICA WITH DUE RESPECT AND REGARD. I HAVE 
DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU ON A BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO 
BOTH OF US AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION. 
 
DURING OUR INVESTIGATION AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS 
A VERY HUGE SUM OF MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED ON 23rd 
OCTOBER 1999 IN A PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT 
WITH THIS BANK WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS 
FAMILY OR RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT. 
 
ALTHOUGH PERSONALLY, I KEEP THIS INFORMATION SECRET WITHIN MYSELF TO ENABLE 
THE WHOLE PLANS AND IDEA BE PROFITABLE AND SUCCESSFUL DURING THE TIME OF 
EXECUTION. THE SAID AMOUNT WAS US$20.MILLON (TWENTY MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS). MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS 
THE BONA FIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND 
TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND DIRECTIVES 
AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR 
INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSIST ME AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT 
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF 
MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT IN THIS VERY BANK, WE ARE NOT 
ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE BROW ON 
MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS BANK. 
 
THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR FELLOW WHO 
WILL FILE CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN 
ACCOUNT WHERE HE WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS 
REQUEST AS IT MAY BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE 
CORRESPONDENT BRANCH OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED 
FROM TO YOUR OWN DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT. 
 
MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE AS I HAVE 
MADE ARRANGEMENTS FOR A SUCCESSFUL DEAL BEFORE CONTACTING YOU. 
ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 40% OF THE 
TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES 
THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE BILLS, WHILE 55% 
WILL BE FOR ME. 
 
PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED TO KEEP TOP SECRET AS I AM STILL IN SERVICE AND 
INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER I CONCLUDE THIS DEAL WITH YOU.I WILL BE 
MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY 
IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK I TO COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUBSEQUENT 
SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED AND 
FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE ME TO 
INVEST IN. I SUGGEST YOU GET BACK TO ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ON MY EMAIL, 
(janvxx1@netscape.net).  
 
YOURS FAITHFULLY, 
DR, JAN DE VOS
