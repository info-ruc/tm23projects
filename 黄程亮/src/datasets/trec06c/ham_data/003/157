Well,   strike 1:	a 4x33Mhz still reported a 120Mhz for me

So, I played around and this is the best yet (TOTALLY different from
your setup).  This is basicallt CONFIRMING that there are sub-versions to
the GX4 v2.0 motherboard.  I received one of the very first GX4 boards
available and had to haggle with the jumpers like this to get the DX/2
80Mhz to run well.  This is what I'm tring currently:

JP5:  1+2	P24D, P24T, P24CT, AMD(s) X PLUS hardware trap
JP6:  1+2

JP11: 2+3	Intel processor compatible

		Close to a 485DX4 - 2 x clock setting
JP16: 1+2 5+6	CPU setting
JP17: 1+2 5+6	CPU setting
JP18: 1+2 5+6	CPU setting
JP19: 1+2	CPU setting
JP20: 1+2	4x CLOCK
JP21: 2+3	L1 WT cache setting (DMA conflict fix)
JP22: 1+2 3+4	CPU setting

JP23: 2+3	40Mhz clock
JP24: 2+3
JP25: 1+2

JP26: 1+2	VLB Delay

JP28: 1+2	VLB 0ws
JP29: 1+2	VLB <33Mhz

JP32: 1+2	Intel DX4
