RE: Very expensive Plan9 distribution

I have been quoted 257 UK pounds from Harcourt Brace in London
including Tax, however it is available to special order
only and requires 6 to 8 weeks for delivery (sigh).

I would be interested if anyone knows of a UK distributer who
has it available ex-stock.
