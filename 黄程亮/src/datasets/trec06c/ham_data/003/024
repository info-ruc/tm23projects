hello, 
These may be of some help:

Anderson, R.S., Sorenson, M.L. and Willets, B.B. A review of recent 
progress in the understanding of aeolian sediment transport. Acta 
Mechanica (1991) [Suppl] 1: pp. 1-20

Anderson, R.S. and Haff, P.K. Wind Modification and bed response during 
saltation of sand in air.
Acta Mechanica (1991) [Suppl] 1: 21-51

There are many other good papers in this issue as well.
Hope that helps,
