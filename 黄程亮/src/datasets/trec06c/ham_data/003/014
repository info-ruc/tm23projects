I think the license is clear here:
`This SOFTWARE may be used by you or by an organization of which you are a member or
employee solely for research, development, or educational purposes. Without executing an applicable
sublicense with AT&T, no part of the SOFTWARE may be published, sold, or offered for sale, nor
may any part of the SOFTWARE be made available on a computer network external to you or your
organization, nor may commercial services utilizing this SOFTWARE be sold or offered for sale.'

i.e. commercial organisations (like mine) can use it internally,
but can neither sell it (or any derivative), or make money out of it:-).

BTW: I haven't put in front of the legal eagles here yet,
     but FWIW, on an initial scan, it looks like a reasonable agreement to me
