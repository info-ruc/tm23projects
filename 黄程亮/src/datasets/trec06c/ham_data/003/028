Steve,
How are you doing? I hope that all is well and that you are adjusted to 
being at home again. I am sure that it was not that difficult and that it 
did not take that long. I assume also that you were able to get out of 
Acapulco OK.
	I wanted to talk to you before you left for Europe about the a* 
samples that I took on IRONEX2. In particular, Dick mentioned that you 
ran the IRONEX1 samples and calibrated the machine that they were run 
on. He said that this was done on the Chavez machine at MBARI which was 
in turn calibrated to the Kiefer machine. At the root of my question is 
how do I go about calibrating our new machine in Beaufort. Is there a 
book, paper, or manual that could provide help? Or, does one just run the 
same samples on different machines and use one as the standard and 
correct for the other machine's "differences." Also, I am interested in 
learning how to crunch the numbers from the data. I suspect this is 
pretty straight forward and probably just involves a spread sheet file. 
However, if you could suggest a couple of key papers that would elucidate 
this matter I would be grateful. Also, a sampling of the IRONEX1 data in 
its various forms might be helpful. I will contact you by phone 
shortly to discuss these matters more thoroughly; right now I am just 
giving you a warning shot!
	Related to this is my trip to California. I will be headed to 
California approximately on 20 July. The majority of my time will be 
spent with family affairs, but there is a secondary scientific goal. That 
goal is to calibrate the machine at Beaufort, presumably by running 
samples on calibrated machines in California, and to meet people that are 
involved in this field. I assume that this trip will take a similar shape 
to the legendary trip that you and Marta took - though not quite as 
extensive! I was thinking about being in the bay area around the 20th and 
then heading to the MBARI region shortly after that. I doubt that you 
would have time to accompany me on that part (though you are certainly 
welcome), but I thought that it might be pleasant to meet up while I am 
in the area, assuming that you are still in the country. After being in 
the Bay Area, I was going to go home to Trinidad for a week or so, but 
after I will be driving down through to San Diego. In SD I was planning 
on going to a couple of other labs, mainly Joan Cleavland and Chuck Trees 
and possible D. Kiefer. These are just suggestions right now, but I 
thought that they would be good places to get an idea about how these 
measurements are done. 
	So that's the plot. I will call you probably call you tomorrow 
so that we can talk once before Dick leaves for Oman (4 July). I hope all 
is well in the Bay Area. 
					Cheers, Zackary

PS I have heard even more stories about THE van - quite interesting ones I 
might add. 

PPS Send me the bill for the remainder of the booze that we put on the 
hotel tab in Acapulco. I have submitted my receipts for everything else 
and let D. Gagnon know that you had the hotel bill for Acapulco. I have 
no plans on skipping town, yet.
