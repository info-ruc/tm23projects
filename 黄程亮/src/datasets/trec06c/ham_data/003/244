I concur with Alejandro. An inexpensive QuickCam camera is almost too good to 
be true. It works great and plugs right into your computer's serial port. There 
are two types: color and black/white. Remember that CU-SeeMe only does black 
and white while the White Pine version does color.

One of the problems with CU-SeeMe is the fact that no one seems to be around 
when you want them. 

Here is a suggestion. Just hang out. There is no reason why you can't connect 
to one of our reflectors and just wait for somebody else to show up. While 
CU-SeeMe does require a lot of bandwidth, you can temporarily turn of the 
sending of video to reduce the load.

Try connecting to the reflectors and just waiting. Try using the reflector as a 
"study hall" sort of thing.

What do y'all think?

I believe the entire sunsite.berkeley.edu machine was down all day Monday and 
Tuesday. I believe things are up and running again.

I think this is worth trying. I plan to leave CU-See-Me on during the
afternoon for a while.
