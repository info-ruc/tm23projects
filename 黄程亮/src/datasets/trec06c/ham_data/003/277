Hi!  Some of the disks (ex., u1, where most of you are) are essentially 
full.  Please archive all old data in compressed format, and delete what 
you do not need.

If you want, you can create a compressed tar file of old information that 
I can copy to a Computing Center system that serves as a backup unit, 
from which we can recover later - just let me know.

Please DO THIS THIS WEEK or else we may need to start removing old files 
on our own ...

Many thanks, eaf
