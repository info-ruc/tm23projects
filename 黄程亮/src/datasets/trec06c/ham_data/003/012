The new Plan 9 distribution will be available in mid to late July.  It will
consist of a two-volume manual, a CD-ROM with all the sources, and
four PC diskettes comprising a binary-only installation of a fairly
complete version of the system that runs on a PC.  The distribution
will cost $350; the printed manuals alone will be available for
considerably less.  The details of how to order are still uncertain.
