The way I see it, the L2 cache is wired directly to the CPU, and not 
(as I think it should be) to the memory system.  The method used for 
WB cache obviously assumes (incorrectly) that it is the only device 
that can be in control of the bus, and doesn't bother to check.

Please let me know what your jumper settings are/were.

I've just noticed something similar, I am getting a faster benchmark 
with my L2 cache *disabled* than when it is enabled.  At the moment 
it is WB, I will set it to WT and see if that helps at all.  I am 
trying to download WinBench 96 right now so we can make direct 
comparisons.

In case I haven't told you before, I am running Novell Dos 7, Windows 
3.1, Win32S 1.30 and used to use QEMM 7.5 (which hasn't worked since 
I put in the new CPU).  I have 256K (32K x 8) of 15ns L2 cache 
memory.

Cheers
Graham
