before i go hacking at the source, has anyone
come across and fixed the fact that rc seems to
reap its children from a <{} inside a for loop
only after the for loop is done?

example:
	term% for (i in `{seq 1 100}) { 
		echo -n $i... ; diff <{cat /adm/users} <{cat /adm/users}
	}
	1...2...3...4...5...6...7...8...9...10...
	11...12...13...14...15...16...17...18...19...20...
	21...22...23...24...25...26...27...28...29...30...
	31...32...33...34...35...36...37...38...39...40...
	41...42...43...44...45...46...47...rc: can't get pipe
	term%
