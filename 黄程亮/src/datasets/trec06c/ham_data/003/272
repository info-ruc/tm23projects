Thanks again for everybody that responded to my previous questions
(not very many but few anyway). Hapyy new year to all of you, too.
Here follows a couple of questions:

1. We in our laboratory are considering purchasing MEKU (Erich
Pollahne) Soil Sample Extractor (with MEKU High Pressure Rinsing Pump)
for separating pcn cysts from soil samples. Anyone has any experience
with this machinery or anything that would be comparable to that. I
should be easy and quick processing of the samples with no technical
flaws? A comment from a representative of the company will be
ignored...

2. Does anyone know if there'd already be PCR primers commercially
available for identificating potato cyst nematodes (rostochiensis vs.
pallida)? How about for Meloidogyne (chitwoodi/hapla/fallax)?

Please all of you that really have something to say about these
matters take a stand and speak! Thank you very much.

- Jyrki -

Our lab would like to examine intraspecific sequence variation in any
single-

aoronymphium
(Allantonematidae: Tylenchida).  Our best bet for designing PCR primers

Any

Dear Dr jaenike,

You probably wont get too much intraspecific variation in the coding
region of a single copy nuclear gene. How about looking at an intron?
It wouldnt be too difficult to design primers that span an intron in,
say, a collagen gene. The coding region will be conserved enough to
make sure you get amplification from all your samples and I would
imagine that the intron sequence would be more likely to show
variation. I wouldn't swear to this though - maybe someone else has
better suggestions...
