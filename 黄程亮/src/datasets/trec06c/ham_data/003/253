Thanks for your note regarding my CMJ article on fractals 
and linear algebra. I should point out that almost all of 
the figures in the article are examples of attractors that 
are included in the software application "Fractal Attraction", 
i.e., I can't take credit for creating these particular 
attractors! Below please find the data for the tree. 
The initial polygon coords were obtained by reading the 
mouse coords, so they might be slightly off. 
Also, to generate this tree, the polygon is not closed. 
That is, to get the trunk of the tree looking nice, 
the trunk of the initial polygon is cut off 
(as you'll see when you draw it). 
The coordinates of the space for this fractal are 

[-0.5,0.5]x[0.1,0.9]. 

Initial polygon:

p=[ (-.05,.1), (-.2,.2), (-.4,.2), (-.48,.3), (-.5,.4),     
    (-.4,.6), (-.3,.72), (-.2,.8), (0,.9), (.1,.9), (.3,.8), 
    (.5,.6), (.4,.5),(.5,.4), (.4,.25), (.35,.10), (.2,.15), 
    (.05,.15), (.05,.1) ]

The five maps, in the form matrix[[row1],[row2]], vector[x,y]:

[[.459,-.226],[.073,.602]], [-.002,.319]
[[.343,.376],[-.203,.546]], [-.022,.330]
[[.136,.503],[-.313,.138]], [-.02,.217]
[[.253,-.49],[.308,.35]],  [-.007,.198]
[[.066,.000],[.000,.479]],  [-.015,-.024]

Hope this works out for you,

Jim
