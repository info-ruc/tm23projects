Sum Comments
============

The See A Librarian Project is into its second week. Last Friday a very good, 
impromptu conference took place between people in Michigan, Washington DC, 
Colorado, Mexico, Florida, and North Carolina. With only minor technical 
difficulties, quite a conversation was experienced. Kudos to the CU-SeeMe 
folks!

Please continue to spread the word about See A Librarian 
(http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~emorgan/see-a-librarian/), and continue to 
connect to the reflectors. It seems that later in the day is the best time for 
everybody. Alternatively, we can schedule set times.


Sum Projects
============

I have discovered that the State Library sytem of Florida was been awarded a 
grant to play with CU-SeeMe. The grant's purpose is to extend skill of state 
librarians to remote librarians of Florida. Hopefully we will be experiencing 
some activity from more folks from Florida as they acquire their hardware.

In Colorado, the use of CU-SeeMe is being explored for the same sorts of 
purposes as in Florida. They will be able provide useful information concerning 
their infrastructure since many of their participants will be using modems for 
their network connections.

The University of Michigan has been using CU-SeeMe and teleconferencing to do 
extended reference services. I believe they have been experimenting for at 
least one if not two semesters. An article in Academe Today briefly describes 
their experiences.


Sum ideas
=========

Sum ideas for the use of CU-SeeMe in library settings that have come out of our 
discussions include:

  1. reference services
  2. training
  3. "study hall" sessions
  4. debates
  
The last item particular intrigues me for this project. Next time you see a 
raging debate taking place on a mailing list. Invite opposing sides of the 
argument to debate thier points of view on a CU-SeeMe reflector. While the 
debate takes place, other can "lurk" and watch the debate.


Sum Trivia
==========

  1. The SEE-A-LIBRARIAN-L mailing list now has 18 subscribers.
  2. Since July 1st, there have been 381 connections to the See A Librarian 
home page at http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~emorgan/see-a-librarian/.
  3. Since June 26th there have been at least 190 connections to the reflector 
at vega.lib.ncsu.edu. (I have not been yet able to accuratly extract this 
information from the reflector at sunsite.berkeley.edu.)

See A Librarian has made the news.

Jeffrey R. Young of the Chronicle of Higher Education who was a part of our 
conference on Friday, has written an artcle briefly describing how we are 
trying to use this technology to improve librarianship.

I have secured permission to repost the article's contents here. You can also 
see a screen shot of the conference from Jeffery's desk by going to:

Librarians Use Videoconferencing to Connect with Patrons, Colleagues

It's the dead of winter at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor -- a 
blinding blizzard and subzero temperatures. A student has a question for a 
reference librarian, and she'd like to go over to the Shapiro Undergraduate 
Library and ask. But trudging across campus is the last thing she wants to do.

Fortunately for her, the Internet is bringing the reference librarian closer to 
home. At several residence-hall libraries at the university, the staff has set 
up a videoconferencing system that lets students see and hear a reference 
librarian who is on duty at the main library. The students can make 
video-enhanced telephone calls to the main reference desk that are the next 
best thing to being there.

"It's like The Jetsons," says Kathleen M. Folger, a reference librarian at the 
university, recalling the use of videophones in the futuristic cartoon series 
on television in the 1960s.

The library started the high-tech project, called the Interactive Reference 
Assistance program, in October 1995, and it was an immediate hit. "The students 
just really enjoy using it," Ms. Folger says. "They're fascinated by the 
technology."

The University of Michigan's library is one of the first to experiment with 
on-line videoconferencing in this way, but Ms. Folger and her colleagues are 
not the only ones interested in seeing their patrons on the computer screen.

In fact, a librarian at North Carolina State University has set up a forum to 
discuss videoconferencing in libraries. Appropriately, the forum takes place on 
an Internet-based videoconference.

One of the objectives of the forum is simply to find out how many librarians 
have the cameras and the know-how to tune in, says its creator, Eric L. Morgan. 
The results so far have been promising. One day in early July, six librarians 
from institutions in four U.S. states were on line, their smiling faces visible 
in small boxes on their computer screens. For more than an hour, they discussed 
everything from how to use the free "CU-See Me" software that makes this type 
of videoconferencing possible to whether offering the on-line reference service 
was worth the trouble.

Ms. Folger, one of the participants, did much of the talking, as other 
librarians quizzed her about the University of Michigan's teleconferencing 
experiment.

"The biggest problem we had was technical support," she told the group. 
"There's no number to call to ask for help because it's all freeware." This 
fall the university plans to try a commercial software package and to upgrade 
from black-and-white to color cameras.

One of the biggest surprises, Ms. Folger says, was how much more comfortable 
most students felt on camera than in person. "Students will talk to you and be 
much more open with you than if they were here in person," she says. "The first 
night we did it, I had students flirting with me. I had one student ask me 
out."

Both Ms. Folger and Mr. Morgan say that the unique experience of talking with a 
librarian in virtual space -- with its unusual mix of personal interaction and 
private setting -- makes the service worthwhile.

Ms. Folger admits, however, that there are some students who would just as soon 
pick up the phone and not be seen by their librarians. "Some of the females 
when they saw themselves on the camera said, 'Oh my hair looks awful.'"

Mr. Morgan plans to keep the forum open all summer. Librarians can check in at 
any time to see if their colleagues are talking shop.

Subject: PTT button

I have talked to Eric a couple of times using CuSeeMe but when I click on
the PTT button, so that I don't have to manually push the Talk button, Eric
can hear me but I can't hear Eric. Any advice on fixing this?
