Subject: PB ISDN Tariff Proposal (long)
Status: RO

Dan and Bob,

Thanks to the CPUC and PacBell Regulatory, I got my paws on a paper copy of
this month's ISDN tariff filing. It's hundreds of pages, but of course
mostly drivel. I scanned in the "good stuff" in an attempt to generate an
electronic version that could be more easily distributed. I apologize in
advance for any errors made by me or the OCR software (but not for those
made by Pacific Bell).

I've got my own set of opinions about what's right and what's wrong with
this proposal, but I'll save those for a separate discussion. I know that
you both deal with lots of folks that might be interested in this stuff, so
I'm passing this on to you for you to use as you see fit.

Happy New Year!

David

II. INTRODUCTION

1.  Description of ISDN Service

ISDN is a network platform for transmitting digital voice and data services
through a limited set of standardized worldwide interfaces. Currently, two
forms of this interface exist in the United States:  Basic Rate Interface
("BRI") and Primary Rate Interface "PRI"). We currently offer three versions
of BRI ISDN service: Centrex ISDN, ISDN (on business lines), and Home ISDN
(on measured residential lines). Each of these offerings provide digital
transmission from our central office to a customers premises. With digital
(rather than analog) transmission, customers receive integrated voice/data
communication capability for the transmission of circuit switch voice and
data and packet switched data. These services are currently used by
customers to access Internet, conduct video-teleconferencing, send and
receive electronic mail, etc.

Centrex ISDN service is tariffed as a permanent Category II service
offering. ISDN (for  business) and Home ISDN (for measured residence) are
tariffed as provisional Category I services. All three of these offerings
are designed to be purchased along with basic subscriber access service,
i.e. the prices for ISDN service do not include basic subscriber access service.

2. Relief Requested

We request that the new rate structure and new rate elements for ISDN
services be approved. This will enable our prices to better reflect our
costs in providing the services.

We request that the ISDN (for business) and Home ISDN (for residence)
offerings be made permanent. This would eliminate the provisional nature of
the service.

We also request that the names for Home ISDN and ISDN be changed to Personal
ISDN and Business ISDN. This will eliminate customer contusion as to the use
of each service.

These changes are needed to assure that ISDN services better reflect its
costs and that such services are marketable and attractive to customers.

III. RATE RESTRUCTURING

1.  Background

We are proposing to restructure ISDN rates because two of our assumptions in
our original ISDN tariff filing have proved inaccurate. When ISDN services
were initially tariffed, prices were structured on the best information,
including capital and expense requirements, available at that time. We now
have information, including actual capital and expense costs, from providing
service to approximately 50,000 ISDN customers.

The first assumption is the occurrences of customers located more than 15-
kilofeet from the serving central office. Our original studies estimated 12%
of the customers would be located more than 15 kilofeet from the central
office. These studies reflected that many of the earlier ISDN customers were
centered closer to wire centers in more metropolitan areas. Our current
studies - which are based on actual use - indicate that 24% of Business ISDN
and 30% of Home ISDN customers are located more than 15 kilofeet from the
central office. Furthermore, our studies indicate that the incidences of
ISDN customers residing more than 15 kilofeet from the serving central
office will increase as demand for telecommuting and Internet access grows.

The second assumption is the amount of night and weekend usage by Home ISDN
customers. Home ISDN customers currently have unlimited local usage during
night and weekend time slots (daytime local usage is billed at prevailing
measured service prices). The monthly recurring price for Home ISDN, ($1
5/month), was designed to cover the cost of approximately 15 hours of local
usage each month and all other ISDN costs. In actual practice, the majority
of customers are under 20 hours of usage each month. However, a minority of
users apparently are maximizing their usage on evenings and all weekend
long. This has resulted in an overall average of 47 hours of night and
weekend local usage per Home ISDN customer per month.

Our analyses show that our current prices will not sustain our ISDN
services. This will harm both ourselves and our customers. The ISDN prices
must increase in order to better reflect our costs to provide ISDN services.

2.   Proposed Rate Restructuring

With this application, we propose to make the following changes to the basic
rate ISDN services:

Price increases:
    * The monthly recurring prices will be increased by $8 per month for
Centrex ISDN,
    * The charges for additional minutes of Local Use for Home and Business
ISDN will be increased from $0.0105 to $0.0210 per minute for daytime usage,
from $0.0073 to $0.0146 for evening usage, and from $0.0042 to $0.0084 for
night/weekend usage,
    * The current offer to waive installation charges for a 2 year term
agreement will b6 eliminated and,
    * The current unlimited local usage option for Home ISDN will be capped
at 20 hours per month.

Price decreases:
    * The current $4 charge for the four most popular optional features will
be eliminated. These features will be automatically provisioned as part of
the Basic Feature Package,
    * Volume and term related discounts will be introduced.
    * A new intraLATA toll discount plan will be introduced to meet the
needs of ISDN customers.

This restructuring is based on our analysis of the embedded and incremental
costs of providing ISDN for the next five years. These studies incorporate
process improvements and favorable pricing from our equipment vendors. As
described above, the studies also reflect our estimate of the incidence of
dense and remote demand for the service and actual usage. To assure that
revenues better reflect costs during the next five years, our monthly
recurring price for Centrex -ISDN should be increased by $8.00, the charge
for additional minutes of Local Use for Home and Business ISDN should be
increased as noted above, the current term related waiver of installation
charges should be eliminated (the current termination liabilities relating
to me two year terms will be waived for existing term customers), and a 20
hour free local usage cap should be added to Home ISDN service.

There are compelling reasons to make these price changes now. Without these
changes, ISDN service in the aggregate will continue to be under priced.
There are approximately 50,000 existing ISDN customers. This number is
expected to increase to 750,000 during the next five years. If prices do not
better reflect costs, ISDN will create a significant subsidy burden that we
are not in a position to support.

To assure that ISDN service remains attractive to consumers, we will also
eliminate the current $4.00 charge for the four most popular ISDN features:
Hold, Consultation Hold, Three-way Conferencing, and Call Transfer.

In order to allow our customers to better manage their telecommunications
costs, we will offer term and volume discounts as follows:

               3yr term discount/month 4yr term discount/month 
ISDN (Bus)            NA                       $1.00 
Centrex ISDN          $1.00                    $2.00 

                                    Product      Monthly Discount/Line
Single location, 10 or more lines    ISDN              $2.00
                                     Centrex ISDN      $2.00
                                     Home ISDN         $1.00
Multiple locations, 10 or more lines ISDN              $1.00
                                     Centrex ISDN      $1.00

In addition, we will offer a unique set of toll discount plans. These
discounts are designed to mirror the pricing on applications such as
Internet access services, i.e. a fixed discounted price for a specified
amount of usage. Here is the proposed discount schedule.

Call Allowance          Monthly Rate         Installation Charge
         
 $20.00                      $12.95               $5.00
 $50.00                      $32.50               $5.00 
$100.00                      $64.95               $5.00 
$150.00                      $97.00               $5.00 
$200.00                      $129.50              $5.00 
$250.00                      $159.50              $5.00 
$300.00                      $189.50              $5.00

Customers who take advantage of these discounts will be able minimize the
overall cost of ISDN applications.

3.   Price Levels
We are proposing to increase the local usage charges on Home and Business
ISDN in order to allow the customers as much flexibility as possible to
control the cost of their service. These new ISDN prices are designed to
generate revenues that should cover incremental costs for Home and Business
ISDN, i.e. a revenue-to-cost relationship close to 1.0.
          
The revenue-to-cost ratio for Centrex ISDN revenues will be higher.
Increased usage charges are not being proposed for Centrex lSDN because
there is very little local usage over Centrex ISDN lines (e.g. most local
calls are unbilled intercom calls). This is caused by the fact that Centrex
customers tend to be located in densely populated areas, i.e. Centrex ISDN
costs reflect a relatively low incidence of high cost service. We are
requesting an $8.00 increase in Centrex ISDN prices to maintain an
appropriate price relationship between the various ISDN services, i.e.
Centrex ISDN is currently priced at a premium above Home and Business ISDN
because of the additional functionality that Centrex ISDN provides to
customers. This price premium should continue. If Centrex ISDN prices are
not increased commensurate with the other ISDN service, it is likely that an
increasing number of customers in remote locations would select this
service. If this were to happen, Centrex ISDN costs would increase, possibly
creating the need for more price changes.

The cost studies, included with this Application collectively as Exhibit F,
are filed under seal because the information contained therein is
proprietary, confidential, and details the direct cost of providing ISDN.

IV. REVENUE IMPACT

The revenue effect of this Application is shown in Exhibit D, attached hereto.
          
V. PROPOSED RATE CHANGES AND TARIFF MODIFICATIONS

A summary of the present and proposed rate elements is contained in Exhibit
B. Tariff sheets evidencing the proposed changes are contained in Exhibit C.
We have provided to the Commission Staff (Legal, CACD, and DRA), the cost
support and associated workpapers upon which the revised tariffs are
predicated under General Order 66-C.

VI. CONCLUSION
     
Pursuant to Article 4 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure,
we respectfully request that the Commission approve our proposed changes to
Schedule Cal.P.U.C. Nos. A5.4.l and A9. 1.1. The requested rate increases
and restructuring are consistent with prior Commission rulings and are
designed to price our ISDN service in a way that better reflects the costs
of ISDN.
