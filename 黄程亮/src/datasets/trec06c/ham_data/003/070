Hi Ted,
Thanks for your note about the wind erosion list. 
Here's a summary about UNLV's wind erosion work.  
UNLV is working on a project funded by the Clark County 
Health District to build and use a portable wind tunnel 
(6" x 6" cross section) to study emission rates from 
disturbed and undisturbed soils in the Las Vegas Valley, 
which is a serious non-attainment area for PM-10.  
The summer field work is completed, and we are now
working up the data to develop emission factors as a function
of wind speed.  The results may be incorporated into a 
State Implementation Plan (SIP) for PM-10 that will be submitted late
this year.
Hope this helps,
Dave James
