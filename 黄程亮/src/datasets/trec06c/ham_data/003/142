Hello Gramm,

Roman Shapiro (roman@galaxy.net) forwarded me your news post on the ASUS
newsgroup about the AMD 133Mhz processor and the GX4 motherboard.  I
wanted to CC: this to you just in case you had any additional ideas.

Yes.. this message is a long one but I plan to post a comprehensive
message on the newsgroup once I know -exactly- whats going on.)


Anyway, could you let me know your thoughts about the following?

Also Gramm, did you upgrade your BIOS yourself?  I have the 401 BIOS image
here and I'm going to burn it today but I'm not sure what format the image
is in.  Is it in HEX, Object, etc?


Anyway... thank you for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.



(The following is the settings in the GX4 motherboard manual and then the
readme file included with the BIOS image from ASUS's WWW site.)
