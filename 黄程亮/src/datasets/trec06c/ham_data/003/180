How did you arrive at these CPU settings?
What happens if you set it up the same way as I did?
JP16: 1-2,4-5
JP17: 1-2,5-6
JP18: 1-2
JP19: 1-2,3-4,5-6
JP20: 1-2
JP21: 2-3
JP22: 1-2,4-5
This is the same as ASUS recommends for an AMD DX4 SV8B
on a GX4 mainboard, and for a 5x86 on an SP3 mainboard.

> AT BUS Clock      : 1/4 CLKIN (10Mhz AT BUS at 40Mhz system clock)
Mine is set at 1/5 CLKIN, does it help pushing the ISA bus a bit?
> DRAM Speed        : Faster      (My machine won't run stable at FASTEST)
Mine is on Fastest (my DRAM is 60ns, and my SRAM 15ns)
>From past experience, even if you have 70ns DRAM, you can still set 
it to Fastest with a 40MHz bus clock, but you have to slow down if 
your SRAM is 20ns.
> Video Shadow      : non-cachable
Mine is cacheable, do you know any more about this setting?
When should it be enabled, and when not?
> Latch Local Bus   : T2
I don't know much about this one, but when I was setting up my 
DX4/100MHz as a 2 * 50MHz, I could only get the system to be stable 
when this was set to T3, so I left it that way.  Maybe this could 
make your system work at the Fastest setting.
> Local Bus Ready   : Syncronize
I don't know anything about this one either, but mine is the same.

I've also had some weird benchmark results.  Try disabling your L2 
cache completely, and check your results.

WinBench 96:
                 GWM 96                CPU 16              CPU 32
L2-WB     5.36                         94.9                    94.1
L2-WT     5.43                         94.9                    94.1
L2-none    5.29                         94.6                   94.2

I'm using Windows 3.1 and Win32S 1.30, so I'm not sure if that is the 
cause of the lower scores.  Either my L2 is not working at all, or 
something else strange is going on.  I saw in the newsgroup that some 
other people have also found that the L2 cache doesn't make much of a 
difference.
I've been thinking about this, and I know that with the older 486's 
(DX, DX2, DX4) that going from 0K to 128K L2 cache makes a big 
difference, but going from 128K to 256K is not noticeable at all.
Now I've been wondering just how much of the 128K is actually being 
used during everyday working.  One of the big differences between the 
5x86 and older 486's is the 5x86 has 16K as opposed to 8K L1 cache.
Now if the loops in the benchmark tests are >8K but <16K that would 
explain why disabling the L2 has little effect on the score.
Otherwise, I either have a faulty CPU or I should look at trying out 
another motherboard.

Cheers
Graham
