I've had problems with grap garbling unicode
inside the G1/G2 pair, but unicode outside the
graph seems to be left alone.  Inside the
G1/G1, unicode becomes a single 0xE2 for me.

Input of 
	term% cat /tmp/graph
	♚
	♘
	♟
	♝
	♗
	.G1
	label left "white ♛"
	label bot "black ♕"
	1 2
	3 4
	5 6
	7 8
	.G2
	term% 
illustrates this nicely.  It is also telling that 
running 'grap -d' on this file commits suicide.

Anyone else with ideas?
