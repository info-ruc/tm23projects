Without giving it too much thought, we could simply use some glue logic
to make one SRAM look like a FIFO and stick that and another SRAM together
and make it look just like a VRAM.

We can make it look just like a VRAM just like I learned in 311 :)

Or if we have something specific in mind, like limited capabilities or
color translations, we can do that also.

It shouldn't be to hard.
