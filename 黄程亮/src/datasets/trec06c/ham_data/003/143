Hey Rick,

I read a post from you on the ASUS newsgroup about upgrading the BIOS on a
ASUS GX4 motherboard.  I have the Award 401 image and have a EPROM burner
ready.  The problem is that the included text file doesn't tell the user
which programmer file format to use!

I'm going to try HEX first but if you have any ideas or comments, I would
greatly appreciate it!

--David
