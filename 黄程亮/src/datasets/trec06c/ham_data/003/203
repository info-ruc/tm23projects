I'm doing an install on a Sparc IPX from u9fs on a Sparc 2.  I've gotten 
TFTP to work; /sparc/9ss loads okay.  The boot process begins okay; I 
answer all prompts appropriately, as far as I can tell.  After logging 
in as user "none", I get as far as:

...session...time

init: starting /bin/rc
init: exec error: file does not exist
init: rc exit status: init #: exec

These three lines repeat ad infinitum with # incrementing (just like 
init.c error logic indicates).

Now I've made sure that /bin/rc exists under the plan9 root.  (I copied 
it from /sparc/bin just in case.)  I've also created user "none" and 
copied the files in /usr/tor to /usr/none.  What file might exec be 
referring to?  Can someone having experience in a similar installation 
give me a hint or two?  What stupid thing am I overlooking?

Thanks.
