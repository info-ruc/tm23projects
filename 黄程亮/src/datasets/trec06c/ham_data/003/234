What if sound works duplex sometimes (I'm using a Power PC) but not 
others? I have the reverse problem - when it's not working I can hear, 
but others can't hear me.

Based on my limited knowledge, I believe the commerical version of CU-SeeMe 
from White Pine (www.whitepine.com) has three major enhancements:

  1. Better compression algorithms
  2. Color video output
  3. A white board for sharing drawings.
  
I am not using the commercial version.

Free demonstration copies of White Pine's enhanced version can be 
downloaded from http://goliath.wpine.com/cu-seeme.html. They're good for 
30 days. I've used it, and it works great. I agree that the compression is 
better on the commercial version, and the whiteboard is handy.

I'm using the free version. Can anyone tell me how much the commercial
version is and how to purchase it? Thanks.
