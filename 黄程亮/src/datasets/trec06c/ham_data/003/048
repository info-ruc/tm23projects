I recently sent a message advertising the upcoming WEPP/WEPS symposium
sponsored by the SWCS.  I just got this information on the SWCS and thought
you might be interested.

************************************
The Soil and Water Conservation Society is a
nonprofit, international organization that
advocates the protection, enhancement, and wise
use of soil, water, and related natural resources.
It was created in 1945, so we're celebrating
50 years at our annual meeting in August.
The international headquarters are in Ankeny,
Iowa, USA.

The SWCS is involved in many aspects of
conservation, including the politics, education,
and promotion of conservation.  We publish the
scientific journal, _Journal of Soil and Water
Conservation_ and many books for adults and
younger readers.

We now have information available via the World
Wide Web at http://www.netins.net/showcase/swcs/
including membership information and the _Journal_
online.

Also, we have an article just out about soil and
erosion research at Ansai, China. You can reach
it through the URL above.  It has many good
photographs available.

You can reach the SWCS general office at SWCS@netins.net
or the _Journal_ staff at SWCSJSWC@netins.net
