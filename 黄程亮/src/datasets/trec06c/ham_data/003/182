  BENCHMARKS

David,

        I've had two people reply that they have successfully configured
their system at 160 and 133 respectivly.  The systems have proven to have
better performance with L2 set to write thru (auto), but both cases have had
no problem with the write back setting for L1 cache.  The person running 160
has cpu marks just below mine.  Are you sure that you are going to be able
to settle for write thru with the cpu marks at the 120's?  Any thing I can
do to help, let me know.

John

Hi,

Just thought I would write to thank you for your information concerning the
AMD-133.  I have now successfully updated to this processor and overclocked
it. It is running stabley at 160 Mhz.

WinBench 96 CPUmark16 and CPUmark32 are both at 172.  Comparable to your
results.

I updated my BIOS to 0401 before I started.  This led to an interesting
observation.  I initially set the cache to write-back (the other option with
this BIOS is auto) and this only gave me CPUmarks of 130-140.  When I
changed the cache settings to AUTO my CPUmarks jumped to 172.  This seems to
parallel your observation about setting the 0306 BOIS cache settings to
write-through.

Another minor note.  At start-up the bios reports the clock speed as 120 or
150 for VLB settings of 33 and 40, respectively.  This appears to be
meaningless as winbench detects the CPU correctly.

Thanks again,
Craig

Your  settings seem to work. I can't seem to find a good program that will
report true clock speed. One program reported 140mhz while the other
reported 236 mhz and the BIOS shows 120 mhz.

I haven't bumped to 160 yet but you and I have exactly the same cards (EIDE
2300 and Stealth 64) so I'll give it a shot later this week.

What is the function of "Latch Local Bus" and "Local Bus Ready" ? I had mine
set to T3 and Synchronize but changed it to T2 and Transparent based on your
settings. I haven't noticed any difference.
