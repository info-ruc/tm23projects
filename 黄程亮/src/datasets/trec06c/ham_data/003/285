I seem to be having a lot of trouble getting grap to work at
the moment.  I prepared a graph in a separate file, and when
I got it working, I cut and pasted the file into my document.
Now all I get is an empty box!  It looks like grap might be
allergic to UTF -- I make quite liberal use of unicode characters
in my document, and they seem to be getting screwed up now
(but they didn't before I added the graph).

Has anyone seen any problems with grap's treatment of UTF,
and perhaps even have a fix?

It's almost enough to make me want to use MS Word...
