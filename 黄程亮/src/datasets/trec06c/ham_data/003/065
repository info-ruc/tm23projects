Hello wind_erosion list members!  I am interested in measuring PM-10
particles in the field and lab.  We currently are using the mini-vol sampler
but would like to test other instruments as well.  We would like to use a
sample that I can mount on a tower.  Do any of you have other instrument to
suggest?  Please respond to the list at wind_erosion@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu
Thank you for your help.

Ted Zobeck
