Here's something I read in a post recently:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Hi
I've seen numerous requests for information on how to set the jumpers 
correctly for this combination.  I received two of these processors this 
weekend, and managed to get them going using the following jumper 
settings:

JP16:	1-2 4-5
JP17:	1-2 5-6
JP18:	1-2
JP19:	1-2 3-4 5-6
JP20:	1-2
JP21:	2-3
JP22:	1-2 4-5

If you leave JP20 open the CPU runs in clock trebling mode instead of
clock quadrupling mode.  You could experiment and try to get it to work 
as a 3*50MHz system.  Both CPUs ran flawlessly at both 133MHz (4*33MHz)
and 160MHz (4*40MHz).  The only problem I did encounter was that QEMM 
7.5 hung when it started, no matter what the speed of the CPU was.
I think it has something to do with QEMM identifying the CPU incorrectly.
Cheers

The SV8 and SV8 stuff only applied to the 80-120 Mhz processors.  The 133 
has and ADZ somewhere I think.

Not sure.  I use write-back and have everything except for a SCSI card.

At 40Mhz, I have the VESA delay enabled.  It may work without it at 33Mhz.

The same setting should allow you to run at 133 and 160- you just have to 
change the bus speed (from 33 to 40).  Compare the settings from the 
beginning of this message to the differenct cpu setting from the manual.  
I think it's closest to the AMD486DXL4 - 2x clock- you may not have to 
change the jumpers much. :)  There may be one jumper different- the one 
that enables internal write-back.

Also, be warned that at 160Mhz (4x40), my GX4 boots up and says 150Mhz.

Good luck.
