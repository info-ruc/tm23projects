Judy, thanks for your interest. 

The reflectors should be up an running all the time. Drop in anytime. Activity 
seems to be greatest in the afternoons. As a case in point, there may be some 
get together between 2 and 4 since some folks from the state of Florida are 
bringing a lot of people online.

In short, try any time. I am trying to stay online as much as possible. 
Remember, this first month is just to *play* with the hardware and software. 
Thus, no questions are silly questions.

Again, the reflectors are located at:

  * vega.lib.ncsu.edu on connection id 0
  * sunsite.berkeley.edu on connection id 0
  
Both reflectors "reflect" the same thing. If you did not C anything, then it 
may have been because no one was there. Try again, and if your computer 
cooperates, stay online and just hang out. 

As an alternative, we can connect directly to each other as long as:

  1. we know each other's IP addresses
  2. we both are running CU-SeeMe
  
This is called point-to-point connnections. Do you want to try it?

'hope to CU online soon.

Hi Eric - I am leaving for the rest of the day but I will be in next week.
I will try the reflector sites again and contact you to perhaps try a
one-to-one teleconf. Thanks.
