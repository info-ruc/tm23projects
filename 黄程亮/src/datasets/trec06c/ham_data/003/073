Hi Ted,

In reply to your query about wind erosion research, let me relate
the work which I have been involved in in the past few years.

We have a tremendous problem with sediments being displaced by
wind action on our clayey soils here in the Red River Valley in
certain years.  The problem is such that the sediments form drifts
(dunes) from a few inches to several feet deep along field borders,
road ditches, drainage ditches, on roads and in urban areas on streets
, driveways, lawns and anywhere else that sediments are deposited.
Along with the sand-sized sediments, substantial amounts of PM-10
type material is also suspended in the air.

I have focused my work on the impacts of the dune sediments on water
quality and nutrient transport offsite form the sediment source.
Some of the work I have done includes:

     1.  Characterization of the sediments physically and chemically,
     2.  Examination of the morphology of the sediment grains using
         electron microscopy,
     3.  Nitrogen mineralization studies on the sediments in a
         laboratory setting,
     4.  Monitoring of changes in nitrate status in dunes underr
         field conditions,
     5.  15N tagging of nitrate to determine leaching potential of
         the nitrate to the shallow water table (0.5 to 2 m depth),
     6.  cursory examination of sediments for pesticides, and
     7.  Examination of the variability of nutrients within a dune system.

I have a student that is currently finishing up a project on 15N tagging
and nitrate leaching in a dune system with a shallow water table (0.5
to 1 m deep).

Some of the work I am interested in includes trying to identify the
distance of transport of these dune sediments in order to develop
soil management strategies to reduce the movement of the sedimemts
our of the field.

I have not addressed the issue of PM-10, but it is definitely a
serious problem that we see.

If I can be of further help, please let me know.

Adios,
