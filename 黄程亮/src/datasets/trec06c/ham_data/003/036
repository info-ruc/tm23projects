wind erosion list members:

Sorry, I thought that the message you just received from me was only going
to one person, not the whole list.  One of these days I'll learn how to do
this stuff.

>>>Dear wind erosion and aeolian research colleagues,
>>>
>>>I recently sent an e-mail to Dr. Dirk Goosens at the Katholic University of
>>>Belgium at Leuven to open a dialogue on the dust work they have been doing
>>>there.  I received in reply this shocking letter.  I believe we all
>>>recognize the important work that has been done by Dr. Goossens and his
>>>Israeli colleagues.  The loss of this research unit will be a blow to the
>>>aeolian research community.  Please read Dr. Goossens letter and follow up
>>>on his need for collegial support in his fight to maintain his position as
>>>well as his research unit.
>>>
>>>Sincerely,
>>>
>>>John Gillies

>>>>Dear Dr. Gillies,
>>>>
>>>>
>>>>Thank you for your message. As you know we have established here in Leuven
>>>>an
>>>>aeolian dust unit focussing on theoretical as well as on experimental
>>>>research (wind tunnel in Leuven + field sites in Israel). I welcome very
>>>>much
>>>>your request to share research initiatives and research plans, but here is
>>>>the problem: our university recently decided, after a calculation of the
>>>>number of students in each faculty, to stop supporting the aeolian dust
>>>>unit.
>>>>This means that, if the decision is confirmed in August, I will have to look
>>>>for a new job in September and the aeolian facilities in Leuven will be
>>>>degraded to industrial archaeology. I have worked 15 years on establishing
>>>>this research, starting from almost zero: it is my life-work. Now, after 15
>>>>years, the scientific results of my work finally become available, and I
>>>>think that you can agree with me that the unit is very productive. Why
>>>>cutting down a unit that worked 15 years to come to maturity and has now
>>>>arrived in its most productive stage? To date, 22 research units all over
>>>>the
>>>>world asked for co-operation - and yet our academic authority cannot be
>>>>convinced.
>>>>
>>>>I would like to inform if you could help me to save my life-work. Could it
>>>>be
>>>>possible for you to write a letter to our university (see address below) in
>>>>which you mention the significance of the work done in Leuven (with respect
>>>>to aeolian dust processes)? If this letter could be signed by different
>>>>collegues of yours who are involved in aeolian (or other) research, it would
>>>>be of significant help to me.
>>>>
>>>>I know, of course, that this response to your letter is quite uncommon: you
>>>>asked for information, and I respond by asking your help! I hope you will
>>>>not
>>>>blame me for this. I only try to prevent our university from blowing up my
>>>>life-work and firing me after 15 years of hard work.
>>>>
>>>>I already told earlier in this letter that, if I will be able to stay in
>>>>Leuven, I will be very happy to share research initiatives and research
>>>>plans. Could you provide me with some more information about the specific
>>>>topics you are interested in?

>>>>Thank you for your help. We do not know each other personally, but I very
