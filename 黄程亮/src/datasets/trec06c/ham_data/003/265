I have (finally) completed the final report for the See You See A
Librarian Project. The text is available at:

  http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~emorgan/see-a-librarian/

In a sentence, I believe the Project was a qualified success. While it
did not attract hordes of librarians nor improve library service to any
great degree, the Project did elevate the awareness of video
conferencing in libraries.

I will turn off the mailing list on Friday. Thank you for participating!

This is the last posting to SEE-A-LIBRARIAN-L. Again, thank you for your
participation.

I am now off to my next project, Index Morganagus, a Harvest indexed
collection of electronic library-related serials. Consider giving it a
try at:

  http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~emorgan/morganagus/

Maybe sometime in the future I can "CU online" again.  :-)
