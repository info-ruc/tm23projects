Hi Guys (F/M),

I have  just bought another  1.2GB EIDE drive for  my PC to  create some
room to store some new OSes I want to play with (i.e. FreeBSD, linux and
"plan 9"), and  I was wondering when  the PC CDROM for "plan  9" will be
released? Any news from the suits yet? :-)

Could  you also  include an  overview of  the hardware  supported? I  am
especially interested in the controller for the CDROM (mine is connected
to a soundblaster  (non-SCSI)), the video controller (mine  is a Stealth
vram) and supported hard-disks (mine are both Extended IDE based). Since
I had some problems with FreeBSD on this...
