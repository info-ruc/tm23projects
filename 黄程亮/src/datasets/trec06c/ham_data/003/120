	If you notice the headers Reply-To: and Sender: and both from sunflowr. <br>
The way things are set up this should not be.  I has this problem with another<br>
recent list and it seemed to clear itself up within a couple of weeks.<br>
<p>
	Until all the above headers read sunbird, we will not be able to reply<br>
to messages.  Hopefully I can get it working soon.<br>

I don't either...and I'm doing some playing around with the "from" field <br>
in my inbox.  Right now I can't tell when something's from the list--it <br>
says it's from the person (Which is cool, by the way, but I wanna see <br>
WEBULA-L or something).  <br>

Ok, I think I got it.  When one of y'all sends to the list, I get a <br>
message from COLLETTE@charlie.u (etc.) and when I send to the list, I get <br>
a beep from pine saying I have new mail from Heidi M. Nickisch, but my <br>
inbox reads To: Multiple recip   <br>

Are we ready to announce the listserv at today's meeting?  Do we need to <br>
do up any kind of very very simple "how to subscribe" or do we assume <br>
that most of these people are list literate?<br>
<p>
(having just taken three tries to unsub from charlie myself, I wonder how <br>
literate I am myself....heh)<br>

Yeah, I guess we can announce it. Folks should know that this is new to <br>
us.  I guess I could sub everyone on the mail list.  Shd we wait and ask <br>
if anyone *doesn't* want me to do that?  And in any way (and if so, what) <br>
do we limit subs?  ("I wanna learn, but I don't know any of this yet")<br>

<p>
Salutations!  And welcome to Heidi's February Webula-L Administrivia Email!<br>
<p>
You may be surprised to find yourself subscribed to WEBULA-L, The USD <br>
Faculty Webmasters Listserv.  However, the group decided at our last <br>
meeting that it would save everyone time and effort if I simply subscribed <br>
everyone on Karen's email list.  This will REPLACE Karen's email list <br>
and all announcements will come through here.<br>
<p>
If you *don't* want to be subscribed to the list, then follow the <br>
directions to unsubscribe yourself:<br>
	1.  send an email to listproc@sunbird.usd.edu<br>
	2.  leave the subject line blank, and <br>
	3.  in the body of the message, put: <br>
		unsubscribe webula-l<br>
That's it.  That's all there is to it.<br>
<p>
I'll send out the HELP file as well, but for those of you who would like <br>
it *now*, send an email to listproc@sunbird.usd.edu where the only word <br>
in the body of the message is <br>
help<br>
(...and remember to leave the subject line blank!)<br>
<p>
Pleasepleaseplease remember that there are two addresses here:<br>
	1.  the listproc address (listproc@sunbird.usd.edu) where you send <br>
your commands to subscribe, unsubscribe, etc., and<br>
	2.  the webula-l address (webula-l@sunbird.usd.edu) where you <br>
send your questions/comments/requests/stuff to the other members of <br>
webula-l.<br>
Please don't confuse the two addresses!  (I had to say it once, and I <br>
won't say it again.  I promise!)<br>
<p>
You'll have noticed that your subscription message gives you a password.  <br>
You shouldn't need this password and may safely ignore it, though you may <br>
just as safely validate it as per instructions given in that email.<br>
<p>
And a final request.  If you have problems with your subscription in any <br>
way, please let me know by private email (nickisch@sundance.usd.edu), and <br>
I'll do my best to take care of the problem.<br>
<p>
Cheers,<br>
Heidi<br>

I haven't had time to attend the Webmaster's meetings so far.  Is this <br>

Hey, hey!<br>
This is the quietest list group I've ever subscribed to....<br>
<p>
Heidi and I would like you all to promote our upcoming Saturday HTML <br>
Workshops....   We have at least 7 spots open for this coming Saturday, <br>
February 24 and at least 15 openings for Saturday March 30.  Here's the info:<br>
<p>
"HATCH YOUR OWN HOMEPAGE"<br>
Basic HTML and Finding Your Way on the Suns<br>
I.D. Weeks Library Room 323<br>
1:00 - 5:00 p.m.<br>
Saturday February 24<br>
Saturday March 30<br>
<p>
For those of you who have attended our HTML I and II, this session will <br>
be an "all-in-one" and will include Joe Reynoldson's tutorials Simple and <br>
Simple2 (THANKS JOE!!) AND we will be scanning one image per participant <br>
and showing how to get it to their www directory.  We will cover just <br>
enough UNIX commands to confuse them... :)  And if time remains, who <br>
knows what comedy routines we'll come up with.  <br>
<p>
Would it be possible to put an announcement of "spaces still available" <br>
in the Suns MOTD?  Joe?  <br>
<p>
Thanks!<br>

Well, someone has to be the first to post a foolish questions, so<br>
I decided to volunteer myself (and besides, I was touched by Heidi's<br>
concern over our lack of on-line activity).<br>
<p>
Would someone be willing to discuss the different approaches to<br>
including a mailer or "mailout" function on your homepage, and<br>
what you feel the advantages to each are?<br>
<p>
Thanks a lot!<br>

Well, I guess I missed your earlier question...but I'd say the purpose of <br>
the list is whatever you all decide it is.  I view it as a chance for <br>
people to ask questions (from newbie to advanced) and others would <br>
respond based on their experiences.  It's kind of difficult to have <br>
really good discussions in the meetings, and this offers a chance for <br>
interactive communication.<br>
<p>
On the other hand, I don't feel I know enough about mailers/mail out <br>
thingies to respond to Cheri's question...anyone else?<br>

Dale asked for clarification on my "mailout" question.<br>
I must admit that since I asked I have come up with a solution<br>
that I am happy with.  But in developing it, I looked at a couple<br>
of different sets of code for sending email back, and wondered<br>
what the advantages were of each. (such as writing your own versus<br>
using the Netscape function, etc.)<br>
<p>
And, to get the discussion going, what kind of messages have<br>
you received from your email address on the web?  I have listed<br>
my homepage with Yahoo and find that most of the questions I<br>
receive are regarding my cats (not what I had intended but often<br>
quite interesting).<br>

Here's the text I use in the USD Foundation html to allow people to send <br>
mail to the foundation:<br>
<p>
&lt;BR&gt;<br>
Send E-Mail to the USD Foundation or Alumni Association: &lt;A HREF="<a href="mailto:">mailto:</a><br>
mmarek@sunflowr.usd.edu"&gt;<br>

<p>
This gives a nicely formatted screen for composing the message, and as <br>
far as I can tell is pretty common to web pages.<br>
<p>
I use my own address because that is most convenient.  A web page that is <br>
a bit bigger operation might want to set up a special address for this <br>
mail to go to.<br>
<p>
I have received several pieces of mail this way, often asking questions <br>
to be forwarded to the Alumni Association or others staff members who are <br>
not Internet Active.  About the only disadvantage is that I can't *tell* <br>
whether the mail is from the WWW page or just a direct E-Mail message.  <br>
This is where a special address would be nice.<br>
<p>

It would be interesting to know how to do that.<br>

I have used the <a href="mailto:">mailto:</a> on the anthropology web pages since the beginning<br>
and it is *very* useful. I would recommend having a separate e-mail<br>
address for the homepage so you can track who uses it. I get about 5 <br>
e-mails a week to that address.<br>
<p>
 At the same time, I've used <a href="mailto:">mailto:</a> e-mail addresses for each faculty<br>
member and for each unit of the web site so that individuals can contact<br>
the person in charge of an individual unit/page within the anthro<br>
resources page. <br>

Michael asked about registering your page with Yahoo.<br>
It is really pretty simple, the trick is to get them<br>
to include you.  If you click on their "Add URL" button<br>
on their first page, the steps walk you through how to<br>
submit.  What I've found is that if you list several<br>
possible categories, they are more likely to include <br>
you (especially if it is a category without a lot of<br>
items currently listed).  I have received a few pieces<br>
of email that came through folks finding the page in<br>
a Yahoo search.<br>
<p>
Glad to see some activity in the discussion group --<br>
I know there is a lot of expertise out there and it is<br>
helpful to have it to draw upon!<br>
<p>
Anecdote:<br>
I updated my personal page yesterday around 5 pm.  This<br>
morning on my email I had a response from a women in<br>
England specifically commenting on the new design!<br>
What an incredible medium we have at our disposal.<br>
<p>
have a good weekend,<br>

	What you probably experienced is a broadcast message.  Someone trying<br>
to "talk" to you, or "write" to you.  It will not harm your editing session. <br>
You can get rid of the garbage text by using the refresh command from within <br>
pico ^L.  After a refresh things should look normal again.<br>
<p>
	Also to avoid this you can issue the command mesg n, before starting<br>
pico which will supress broadcast messages.  You could also add the mesg n to<br>
your .login file which would always suppress messages when logged in, this may<br>
or may not be what you want though :).<br>

Dale asked for clarification on my "mailout" question.<br>
I must admit that since I asked I have come up with a solution<br>
that I am happy with.  But in developing it, I looked at a couple<br>
of different sets of code for sending email back, and wondered<br>
what the advantages were of each. (such as writing your own versus<br>
using the Netscape function, etc.)<br>
<p>
And, to get the discussion going, what kind of messages have<br>
you received from your email address on the web?  I have listed<br>
my homepage with Yahoo and find that most of the questions I<br>
receive are regarding my cats (not what I had intended but often<br>
quite interesting).<br>

Well I guess I'll bite on Mike's question.<br>
<p>
Even though I 've not been able to get to a Webmaster's meeting, the sense<br>
that I have gotten from  talking to others in the group is that this is a<br>
forum to continue discussing issues that are brought up in the meetings.<br>
 Also, it can be a place for someone that has a problem -- where can I find, <br>
<p>
etc -- to post to for other people's input.<br>

If I have read your message correctly:<br>
<p>
You have place the files you want accessible in a public directory or <br>

 The ftp problem appears to be related to the .wq1 file type.<br>

I'm referencing the file with  &lt;a href="filename.ext"&gt; file &lt;/a&gt;.<br>
When the file is a video file or an excel spreadsheet everything happens <br>
the way I expect it to.  Only my quattro pro 4.0  (.wq1) files are causing <br>
a problem.  my browser (netscape 2.0) tries to load it as .htm file and<br>

That is an interesting issue - .htm = .wq1?<br>
<p>
One thing I was going to suggest is compressing the .wq1 file into a<br>
self-extracting (or not self-extracting) compressed file.  With a standard<br>
extension and the helper application available to Netscape, it should then<br>
extract the file when downloaded if that is the default option in Netscape.<br>
<p>
<p>
The other advantage is that the file should be smaller and load more quickly.<br>

Apparently this problem is related to the MIME configuration of our Web<br>
server.  I have been trying to do similar things with Word and Wordperfect<br>
files, with the same problems.  However, on advice from a posting to the<br>
newsgroup comp.infosystems.www.browsers.ms-windows, the source has been<br>
narrowed to the Web server itself.  If it doesn't send the MIME type<br>
correctly, Netscape handles the file improperly.<br>
(note: apparently Netscape is more picky about this than Moasic, as I've<br>
been more successful using Mosaic for downloads)<br>
<p>
Fortunately, the CSCI folks, as well as the people who man HELP@charlie.usd.<br>

and EXE extensions.  Perhaps with a little more tweeking of configuration<br>
WQ1 files can be accommodated as well.<br>

<p>
Just a brief comment.  I have my class syllabus (on my experimental <br>
Homepage www.usd.edu/~kramakr), in both Word 6.0 and Text formats.  <br>
Netscape seems to handle the Word files just perfect (after the first <br>
time when it asks for a Viewer to Configure).  The text files, I have yet <br>
to figure out how to get them to retain some sort of a formatting. <br>
However, given that the page is just about a week old (Thanks to the HTML <br>
workshop last saturday), I am sure I'll make time to figure things out in <br>
due course.<br>
<p>
One other thing,  I recall (perhaps in a Microsoft publication) reading <br>
about a "free Word Viewer" that can be sent along with documents for <br>
folks to view with formatting intact.  If I recall correct it is <br>
available for downloading free from the microsoft site..<br>

	The problem you are experiencing is that the mime type is not <br>
configured to work with our http server (www.usd.edu). We have placed the <br>
mime.types file at the following URL:<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.usd.edu/mime.types">http://www.usd.edu/mime.types</a><br>
<p>
	Everyone can feel free to take a look at it and make suggestions <br>
about extensions you would like us to support. We are not aware of all <br>
standard extensions, so mostly we have stuck with the defaults. Any <br>
suggestions would be welcome.<br>
<p>
	For example, our server supports .wp and .wpd extensions for <br>
Wordperfect files. If there are other STANDARD extensions for different <br>
wordperfect versions, we would be happy to add them. We cannot, however, <br>
just add any old extension. It has to be a STANDARD extension in order <br>
for us to support it.<br>

I think that .wk1 extensions are pretty common for spreadsheets.  And .dbf <br>
for Database files?<br>

I've been doing some PERL programming for the web that may be of interest <br>
to some here.  One program I've created allows a web visitor to add his <br>
URL to a list so that it is immediately accessible as a link for others <br>
to use.  (It is similar to the guest comments feature on the USD home <br>
page.)  I have this set up for a couple of lists I'm involved with, and <br>
I also have a test version that anyone can give a try at<br>
<p>
     <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~theaton/programs/url-list.html">http://www.usd.edu/~theaton/programs/url-list.html</a><br>
<p>
I run a research list called SITKA, and I have created a web page where <br>
people can issue various listpric commands from the web and thus avoid <br>
having to know the command syntax.  You can check this out on the SITKA <br>
home page at<br>

<p>
I have been working on a couple of perl programs recently. I believe they <br>
may be of some use to those subscribed to this list. I have set up <br>
examples of these programs in two pages. One is <br>
<a href="http://www.usd.edu/search/icons.html">http://www.usd.edu/search/icons.html</a>, and the other is <br>
<a href="http://www.usd.edu/search/webdocs.html">http://www.usd.edu/search/webdocs.html</a>. Both of them require a browser <br>
which supports frames, so if you don't have Netscape 2.0 or 2.01, you <br>
should probably get it (at least if you want to view these particular <br>
pages).<br>
<p>
These are dynamic pages which can be used to display images or html <br>
files, as well as a directory structure. I have made the icons.html and <br>
webdocs.html pages as examples, but the code can be modified relatively <br>
easily to work for any site or set of directories. If you have any <br>
questions or suggestions about these programs, please send me mail. <br>
That's jreynold@sundance.usd.edu.<br>
<p>
This is an ongoing project, so the source code may change frequently. <br>
Please be gentle with any criticisms.<br>
<p>
Joe<br>

I have a request and a thought.  One -- I think we should sign our messages <br>
so if there's a question, etc.  we know who to contact.<br>
<p>
Second -- Why do we use gifs if jpeg files  are smaller graphic files and <br>
there's not a lot of descernible (how's that for a word?) difference?<br>
<p>

just thought some of you might not have seen some of the new<br>
self-refreshing gif's (or whatever they are called.)<br>
animated gif of writing a letter stuffing the envelope and mailing.<br>
<p>
anyway ... reference this gif the same way you would a regular gif<br>
and when displayed on a netscape page it will be animated.<br>

Does anyone have a good suggestion for an HTML book to use as a reference or<br>
guide to publishing on the Web?<br>
I looked at almost a dozen at various book stores and was bewildered by the<br>
variety of styles and presentations.<br>
I ended up buying "HTML for the World Wide Web" by Elizabeth Castro, Peachpit<br>
Press... it appears to be a reasonable starter book for a reasonable price [$<br>
18], but I would like to hear about other recommendations from other users.<br>
I should also mention that the Library HTML classes [Net at Night] have been an<br>
excellent resource for beginners like myself. <br>

<i>&gt; I have a request and a thought.  One -- I think we should sign our messages </i><br>

<i>&gt; Second -- Why do we use gifs if jpeg files  are smaller graphic files and </i><br>
<i>&gt; there's not a lot of descernible (how's that for a word?) difference?</i><br>
<p>
	The reason we have so many gifs available is that originally, <br>
jpegs were not supported inline. If we were to remove all of those <br>
images, people's pages would start looking pretty funny. And there is no <br>
sense in doubling the required storage on the server by providing a jpeg <br>
version of every gif that's already out there. Finally, it should be noted that <br>
jpegs are used in some places. For instance the campus map is a jpeg.<br>
<p>
	I agree that jpegs should be used when possible, but I am unaware <br>
of any way to make jpegs transparent, and there is not alot of software <br>
available to make progressive jpegs yet. Until then, interlaced gifs seem <br>
to work just fine, although that is only my opinion.<br>

gifs vs jpg. Joe R is right. JPGs can't be made transparent, to my <br>
knowledge. For design that is a good reason to use them. On the other <br>
hand, we have used jpgs exclusively for certain kinds of pics where <br>
higher quality is an issue as on our paleopathology site.<br>

If I use crtl + shift + ^, it locks up PINE.  If I use the same key<br>
combination again, it "unlocks" and does allow me to mark the text.  At<br>
home, dial-in plain text, I can use a simple ctrl + 6 to get ctrl^ and it<br>

re: gifs vs jpegs<br>
<p>
I have found that some browsers have difficulty with the jpeg files.<br>
when I've tested pages on browsers other than Netscape, they don't<br>
always have viewers configured for jpegs but almost everyone can<br>
read gifs.  I realize there are some real advantages to jpeg, however.<br>

NO ATTACHMENTS etc.<br>
<p>
I apologize if my message and attachment caused any problems.<br>
<p>

header FROM:<br>

<p>
Two--JPEGS vs GIFS<br>
a) JPEGS are not supported inline in many older browsers!<br>
b) JPEGS can not be made transparent yet (to my knowledge)<br>
c) JPEGS can not be made animated yet (to my knowledge)<br>
d) JPEGs software for interlaces is not abundant yet (to my knowledge)<br>
d) For small, limited color graphics like icons, GIFs are VERY small files,<br>
especially if the color palette is restricted.<br>
<p>
GIF allows for any number of colors between 2 and 256. The fewer colors the<br>
less data and the smaller the graphic files. Not all software will let you<br>
set the bits per pixel for GIFs. Adobe Photoshop(Mac/Win),<br>
GIFConvertor(Mac), and PhotoGIF(Mac), Picture Publisher(Win), Paint Shop Pro<br>
3.0(Win), and ToolWorks 2.2(SGI Indy) all do. <br>
<p>
For an example of an animated GIF file (if you want to view one) take a<br>
look at my home page;<br>
at the bottom of the screen is a mailbox gif that I uploaded to the<br>
listserv (sorry -- I've never heard of it being frowned upon to send<br>
UUENCODED files on distribution lists -- it happens regularly on the ones<br>
I'm on).  If you are using Netscape 2.0 (on a Mac or IBM -- not sure about<br>
other platforms or browsers) you will see a letter being written, folded,<br>
stuffed into an envelope and mailed.<br>
<p>
<a href="http://www.usd.edu/~bwjames">http://www.usd.edu/~bwjames</a><br>
<p>
The origional encoded file was sent from an IBM and I admit I didn't check<br>
the preferences when the file was attached (Base 64) but I was able to<br>
download it and it did decode and it did work.  The origional file was<br>
encoded with Base 64 and it was identified as such in the attachment.<br>
Attaching a document/gif to an e-mail is (or should be) a very important<br>
advancement to e-mail as we KNEW it.<br>

As I said in an earlier message, when I tried using GIFs, GIF files of <br>
over a certain size -- 40 k or so, if I remember -- would choke and only <br>
the top portion of the graphic would appear on the screen.  Then I would <br>
have to repeatedly decrease the size of the graphic and upload it to test <br>
to see if it would still choke, or would download to the browser <br>
successfully.<br>
<p>
That is way too much work, when I know the JPG file will work the first <br>
time.  :-)<br>

<p>
All,<br>
<p>
Thanks for the info on animated GIFs, Brad.  I hadn't heard of them before.<br>
<p>
Interestingly, on a fast Mac (7500) running Sys 7.5.3 (Update 2.0 for Sys<br>
7.5), the thing animates so rapidly that you can't really see what is<br>
happening.<br>
<p>
Also, for anyone interested, I had tried Netscape 2.0 with Sys 7.5.2<br>
(including OpenTransport) and it locked up the machine.  I downloaded the<br>
Updater 2.0 which updates Sys. 7.5 (including 7.5.2) to System 7.5.3 which<br>
fixes some problems, speeds up the Finder, and adds some new features.<br>
Netscape 2.0 still locked up the machine.  I just downloaded Netscape 2.01<br>
and it seems to be running fine on the 7500 with Sys 7.5.3.<br>
<p>
I had also earlier downloaded a copy of the Mac version of Internet<br>
Explorer and it seemed to run fine (I'm not used to the interface).<br>

Subject: Meeting topics???<br>
<p>
Greetings:<br>
<p>
The brochure says that the "WebMasters meet about once a month."  The last<br>
meeting was about a month ago (allowing for spring break).  What are your<br>
suggestions for topics for the meeting?  Please suggest topics you would<br>
like to learn about OR a topic you would offer to present about.  Use your<br>
best judgement about whether you want to send suggestions to the whole list<br>
or just to me (the list would be fine but I'm not sure all would want to<br>
carry on a list discussion to select the topic(s)).  How many iterations<br>
would it take?<br>
<p>
The last meeting was on a Thursday at noon.  I will schedule a meeting for<br>
Thursday, March 28 at noon ('til about 1) in Room 107 of the Education<br>
Building.  You might also send a note to me regarding really good and<br>
really bad times for meetings.<br>
<p>
A little background:<br>
<p>
Karen Zimmerman was the conscripted first coordinator of this group<br>
(because she along with Larry, Heidi, and Joe Vitt were instigators).  At<br>
the last meeting Karen announced that she was taking a job at the<br>
University of Iowa -- already!  Through a process neither democratic nor<br>
systematic, I was conscripted over my mild objections (mild because I think<br>
the Group is useful and important; objections because I never go gently<br>
into another organizational task).<br>
<p>
Quoting again from the brochure, "Topics are presented by members on a<br>
variety of issues surrounding Web use and development."  If our recent,<br>
very active discussion of gif vs jpeg is any indication, there must be<br>
things of interest.<br>
<p>
Thanks to Joe R. and Tim H. for their offer of PERL info.  Another example<br>
of potential topics?<br>

Despite overwhelming response, I thought I'd go ahead with the meeting this<br>
Thursday:<br>
<p>
Web User's Group<br>
Noon to 1<br>
Thursday, March 28<br>
Room 107 Education<br>
Topic: How about graphics formats and creation?<br>
<p>
I recieved only two replies to my request for suggested topics, both from<br>
people who said that noon Thursday was not a good time for them.  One topic<br>
suggested was "The Virtual Classroom."  Unfortunately the topic had no<br>
volunteers to present.<br>
<p>
The discussion on the list about gif vs jpeg, etc. showed some interest.  I<br>
thought we could take a look at some sites that give info about graphics,<br>
techniques we've learned, software and hardware being used, etc.<br>
<p>
Please bring your insights and URLs.<br>
<p>
Perhaps we can also spend a few minutes talking about other topics for<br>
future meetings.<br>

Sorry that I will not be able to make the thursday meeting at noon - <br>
since the class I teach does not end till 12:15 and it takes 5-10 mins <br>
for me to get "free".  Perhaps, I'll make it a bit late.<br>

<p>
Greetings.<br>
I've run across a couple of sites that may be useful and thought<br>
I would forward the URLs to the group in case you didn't have them.<br>
<p>
One of the simplest way to get your page listed in online<br>
directors is to use Submit It (a forms-based way to <br>
submit information to around 19 different search sites).<br>
The address is:<br>
  <a href="http://www.submit-it.com">http://www.submit-it.com</a><br>
<p>
Computerized HTML checkers can help detect oversights and errors,<br>
and some of the better ones are:<br>
  <a href="http://imagiware.com/RxHTML.cgi">http://imagiware.com/RxHTML.cgi</a><br>
  <a href="http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~gerald/validate.cgi">http://ugweb.cs.ualberta.ca/~gerald/validate.cgi</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.webtechs.com/html-val.svc/">http://www.webtechs.com/html-val.svc/</a><br>
(or at least I'm told they are among the best--haven't tested<br>
them personally).<br>
<p>
We were also chatting informally about free graphics images<br>
available on the web.  For clouds &amp; other scenery, you might<br>
want to look at:<br>

Subject: Changing ownership of files and directories<br>
<p>
	One of the the qeustions at todays meeting was about changing the<br>
ownership of a file.  <br>
<p>
	The definative answer is that only the super-user (root) can change the<br>
ownership of a file or directory.  This means that if anyone wants to assing<br>
ownership of web pages to someone else it will have to be done by myself or<br>
someone else in the Computer Science Department.<br>

Subject: Re: HTML Books<br>
<p>
Barry,<br>
<p>
Good question -- hope you didn't think everyone was ignoring you!  I've<br>
looked at a couple of books but don't have a very good answer.  It seems to<br>
depend upon what specifically you want to read about (e.g. I bought one<br>
that covers CGI, HTML, etc. from Programmers Press (Tittel, et al.).  It<br>
has more than I wanted about some topics, but is good on others.  I haven't<br>
begun to get through it all.  What I did notice about the books is that the<br>
HTML they include varies a lot (version 2 vs 3).  Supposedly V 3 of HTML<br>
will be approved soon (if not already) so it might be good to wait a little<br>
or at least get one that claims to cover version 3.<br>
<p>
Also it depends on the browser you are assuming.  I'm seeing more pages now<br>
that use Netscape frames which no one else supports.  Some books seem to<br>
try to cover each varient of HTML to some extent and others are more<br>
"pure."<br>
<p>
Finally, probably most people don't have a favorite book because they use<br>
Web resources for documentation.   It is nice to have a book handy to thumb<br>
through when in doubt.<br>
<p>
Sorry, how's that for not answering?<br>

PS  If anyone gets this twice, sorry!  Apparently my email combination is<br>

<i>&gt;Does anyone have a good suggestion for an HTML book to use as a reference or</i><br>
<i>&gt;guide to publishing on the Web?</i><br>
<i>&gt;I looked at almost a dozen at various book stores and was bewildered by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;variety of styles and presentations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I ended up buying "HTML for the World Wide Web" by Elizabeth Castro, Peachpit</i><br>
<i>&gt;Press... it appears to be a reasonable starter book for a reasonable price [$</i><br>
<i>&gt;18], but I would like to hear about other recommendations from other users.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I should also mention that the Library HTML classes [Net at Night] have been an</i><br>

Well, yes and no, I guess.  Of course, I'm not the best person to be <br>
answering this, but if you use Netscape (frames, don't you know) to look <br>
at <a href="http://www.usd.edu/search/webdocs.html">http://www.usd.edu/search/webdocs.html</a>, you'll see that some <br>
directories say something like: "Could not open <br>
/usr/local/blahblahblah".  That's 711 talkin'.  Now, the tutorial <br>
(howtomk.html) *used* to say 711, and that's what we thought was right, <br>
but 755 will let this cool stuff take place.  There's more to the story, <br>
but perhaps Joe with Hat could step in here? :)<br>

<p>
	I'm certainly not an authority on how this works, and I am also <br>
not so good at explaining, but I can try with an example.<br>
<p>
	Lets say I make a subdirectory called testing in my home web directory <br>
(that is to say /home/csci/ugrads/jreynold/www) to contain web pages I am <br>
currently working on. In other words these pages are "Under Construction." <br>
If I make the permissions on that directory 755 (and of course 644 for <br>
the documents within it), then when I link to the URL <br>
<a href="http://www.usd.edu/~jreynold/testing/">http://www.usd.edu/~jreynold/testing/</a> I will get a listing of the html files <br>
in that directory with links to each file (unless of course there is an <br>
index.html file, in which case that page will be displayed). <br>
<p>
	Now lets say I don't want people looking at those files at random, <br>
but I still want to look at them while I'm "testing." If I set the <br>
permissions to 711 for that directory, and try to link to the URL <br>
(<a href="http://www.usd.edu/~jreynold/testing/">http://www.usd.edu/~jreynold/testing/</a>) I will get some sort of <br>
error, but not a listing (unless there is an index.html file which will <br>
then be served by default). I can still view the pages in that <br>
directory by entering their exact URL. (again remembering the permissions <br>
must be 644 for each file). <br>
<p>
	For example <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~jreynold/testing/testpage.html">http://www.usd.edu/~jreynold/testing/testpage.html</a> <br>
could still be referenced, but is less likely to be accidentally stumbled upon.<br>
<p>
	So 711 and 755 are both right. 711 affords a little more <br>
privacy while 755 allows for listings of directories (which do not contain <br>
index.html) by a web browser.<br>
<p>

***************<br>
TO DIAL-IN USERS:  On Fri. April 5 we will be adding 8 28.8Kbpps modems<br>
to the modem pool.  6 will be on new phone lines, 2 will be replacing<br>
existing 2400 bps modems.  Because of this the modem pool will be<br>
unavailable starting at 8:00 a.m. until we finish adding the new lines.<br>
This should be done by mid afternoon.<br>
***************<br>
<p>
So now that these lines are available, does anybody have a clue as to <br>
what number to call to get 28.8 access on the dial-in ports?<br>

<p>
I've been experimenting with special characters (diacrimals, Greek letters,<br>
line draw characters, etc.).  I'm having two problems.<br>
<p>
First, when I use Lynx from home over the modem I get a completely <br>
different character set than the normal one that I get using either <br>
Netscape or Lynx at the office.  This applies to characters made from the<br>
number codes and the text descriptions.  Does anyone know of a way to fix <br>
this?<br>
<p>
Second, I can't find several characters that I need in the normal <br>
character set, such as the Greek lowercase Delta and line draw characters<br>
(both of which, ironically, are available in the set that Lynx gives me <br>
at home).  Is there a way to create such characters that any of you know <br>
of?<br>
<p>
I would appreciate any available help.<br>

This probably won't help you with your specific problem of getting a <br>
particular Greek character within a "normal" font, but you may be <br>
interested in what classicists have done to enable them to use Greek <br>
online.  Chech out the Perseus Project at <br>
<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/TextHelp.html">http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/TextHelp.html</a> for directions on acquiring a <br>
Greek font with complete diacriticals and setting your browser to display <br>
them in a Windows or Macintosh environment.  I don't know what you'd do <br>
with a text-based browser such as Lynx.<br>

Members of the group may be interested in a project that I had my students <br>
in Honors Western Civ do, with help from the Honors Program and InTEC.  The <br>
House the West Built is a series of multimedia presentations concerning <br>
aspects of Western Civilization selected, researched, and produced by small <br>
groups of the students.  I have been assembling the projects this weekend <br>
and hope to be done by Tuesday at 12:30 when the students will present them <br>
to each other in the library computer classroom.  You are all invited.<br>
The presentations will be made via the World Wide Web.  But as many of them <br>
include copyrighted images, I shall not announce the link, at least until I <br>
have thought more about the applicability of Fair Use.  Perhaps some of you <br>
could give me advice; perhaps indeed we could have a discussion on the <br>

I'm a little behind the power curve here, but I'm trying to find outthe <br>
best meeting time(s) for the WWW User's Group as a whole.  I realize <br>
that no one time will be perfect for everyone, but please contribute!<br>
<p>
What day(s) work *best* for you to meet?<br>
<p>
What time(s) on what day(s) work *best* for you to meet?<br>
<p>
I'd rather have your best meeting times rather than your "I can't make it <br>
then" times because most of you teach, have regular committee meetings, <br>
etc, and the list will be too long....<br>
<p>
Folks, pleasepleaseplease send to me directly (nickisch@sundance.usd.edu) <br>
instead of to the list! :)<br>
<p>
Please send your preferences to me by Friday, 5pm (that's 56 hours from <br>
now!), and I'll tally the results so that we can announce another meeting <br>
very soon.  Oh, and no complaining from people who don't respond, OK? :)<br>

I thought it went very well (speaking as an outside but not entirely<br>
objective observer).  Not all students were entirely finished with their<br>
work, but what was done was interesting with sparks of creativity.  It<br>
would be well worth a visit to IdeaFest next week to take a look at the<br>
finished products.<br>

Subject: Next Web Users Group Meeting
<p>
Attention:
<p>
The end of the semester is at hand!  It is time to repent of your non-Unix
ways.
<p>
Or, in other words, Joe Collette has kindly agreed to enlighten us "Less
than Unix" users.  The topic he has offered to present is "A session on
file and directory manipulation in Unix."  This grows out of his message
regarding ownership of directories as discussed at the last meeting.
Probably if there are specific questions you have, you could send them
ahead of time to Joe or to the list.
<p>
The meeting is scheduled for next Friday, 12 - 1, and tentatively again in
room 107 in the Education Building.  The time seemed to be the best one
from Heidi's request for input, and the room is pending upon what Joe needs
for equipment.
<p>
 At the beginning of next week I'll send a confirmation of the place to the
list.  If you know of faculty/staff who are beginning to develop Web pages
who are not on the list, let them know.

Hi folks.  I look forward to meeting with you today at noon if I get an 
exam done in time.
<p>
I'm exploring ways to use the web in my courses, and I've designed some
practice exams to help my ESCI 103 students to study for their final.
You might want to check it out as an idea (the links are at the top of my
home page, address below).  They are multiple choice questions that give
a printed response to each answer and do so on a green or red screen for
"correct" or "incorrect."  Now I just need to get Heidi to help me add
some bells and whistles!!
<p>
I'd be interested to know if anyone else has done anything similar to this
that I could take a look at and get some ideas from.  My next plan is to
design an interactive geological time scale!

I've written a java application for cps 105 that enables students to 
calculate their final grade.  It helped them determine if they needed to 
take the final exams. (John has a weird grading algorithm)   Its pretty 
simple but you might want to look at
it.  From the USD home page follow the computer science department link.  
You'll find the application under course description, undergraduate, 
105.  The actual URL is: <a href="http://www.usd.edu/csci/courses/105/GradeCalc.html">http://www.usd.edu/csci/courses/105/GradeCalc.html</a>
<p>
You need a java enabled browser to see anything (Netscape 2.0).

&gt; A confirmation and reminder of the meeting:

&gt;     Friday, May 3, 12 - 1:00 in Education 107
<p>
When I arrived at 12:55, I was disappointed to learn that this meeting had
been rescheduled to noon.  I am told that a notice was sent to Webula
about the change in time, but all I saw was something from somebody about
having something else on his schedule, mentioning what appeared to me to
be the wrong time for the meeting.  I skimmed over it pretty fast and it
certainly didn't click with me that it was a formal rescheduling of the
meeting. 
<p>
In the future, if there are changes from the announced time, I'd 
appreciate it if the messages were *very clear* that the time is changed 
from what was originally announced, especially when multiple earlier 
messages have given a different time.
<p>
As it was, this would have been the first of the meetings that was 
scheduled when I was able to attend, and I spent most of it sitting in 
Charlies.  :-)

Subject: Thanks, Joe &amp; next topic?
<p>
First, a big thanks to Joe Collette for doing an excellant job of
compressing the essence (for us) of a semester course into less than an
hour.  Thanks also to Joe Reynoldson for his quick, accrurate typing.
<p>
The consensus of those present (and the two regrets about the meeting) was
that meeting through the summer would be desireable [and fun -- right Heidi
:-)  ?]  I only partially in jest was drafting Carol Lushbough to talk to
us about Java.  She _did not_ answer with "NO."  Are there any other
suggestions of topics (or volunteers)?
<p>
There was a suggestion that it might be possible/useful/"fun" to meet more
often than once per month in the summer.  We didn't follow up on that
discussion.  What are your feelings about meeting frequency?
<p>
Finally, sorry that my last note misled some people into thinking that the
meeting was at 1 rather than 12.  I looked at the message and see how that
could have happened (see copy below).  I'll be MUCH more careful next time.

&gt; both said 12 - 1, but not as clearly as they should have, obviously.

I apparently misunderstood in at least two different messages, 
probably from my skimming messages and not paying enough attention. 
<p>
I have Noon on my schedule for May 10th, and will try to be there.  :-)

I do appreciate *very* much your efforts to coordinate these meetings, and 
even in the part of the meeting I was there for I got some very useful 
information.  In the future I will also try to be more alert in looking 
at these meeting notices!

The next meeting of the Web Users Group will be:
<p>
        Noon - 1:00, Friday, May 31
<p>
The place of the meeting will be announced shortly.  Tentatively, a topic
and presenter are available.  I will let you know as soon details are
firmed up.

PS  Heidi will be gone for the next two weeks.  As she is the "owner" of
the WEBULA-L list, we will be "ownerless."  Unless some really hot issues
flame up, I'm guessing we will survive.
<p>
Wait a minute --  weren't you going to dial in weekly, Heidi?

Barry,
<p>
I still haven't used base 64 encoding (Brad James mentioned it a few weeks
ago).  There is software available on the net to decode base 64; I don't
have the address -- again from Brad.  You probably could do an AltaVista
search and find it.
<p>
An easier solution would be if your colleague's mail program allowed some
other encoding that your software supported.  The most common encoding in
the Mac world in BINHEX 4.0 encoding which the program BINHEX 4.0 as well
as Stuffit Expander handle (both freeware).  Another common encoding is
uuencoding (from the Unix world) and there are shareware programs that
handle decoding uuencoding on the Mac (e.g. UULite 1.6).
<p>
Basically what likely happened was that the text-only version was still
encoded (into ASCII) by his mail software (probably the default) even
though it didn't need to be.  The conclusion is that the two of you need to
"negotiate" the right file format (e.g. Word x.x) and the right encoding so
as to minimize the hassle.

&gt;I am using 'Pathway' mail for my email and have received messages with
&gt;attachments that fail to decode.  The latest contained some hieroglyphics
&gt;such as: x-mac-creator and content-transfer-encoding:base 64.  When I asked
&gt;a colleague to send a text-only text, it was still coded even though he
&gt;confirmed that it was a dos text script.
&gt;Can someone offer some help with this problem?

I do not think that this message should have been sent to webula, do not
bite the hands that feed you.  Dale works very hard to coordinate these
meetings.  If you look at the subject of this message it says:  "Reminder
of meeting this Friday noon."  There was no time change.  Thanks Dale for
coordinating these meetings!  Thanks to you other members for your patience
in reading this late response.

&gt;When I arrived at 12:55, I was disappointed to learn that this meeting had
&gt;been rescheduled to noon.  I am told that a notice was sent to Webula
&gt;about the change in time, but all I saw was something from somebody about
&gt;having something else on his schedule, mentioning what appeared to me to
&gt;be the wrong time for the meeting.  I skimmed over it pretty fast and it
&gt;certainly didn't click with me that it was a formal rescheduling of the
&gt;meeting.
&gt;
&gt;In the future, if there are changes from the announced time, I'd
&gt;appreciate it if the messages were *very clear* that the time is changed
&gt;from what was originally announced, especially when multiple earlier
&gt;messages have given a different time.
&gt;
&gt;As it was, this would have been the first of the meetings that was
&gt;scheduled when I was able to attend, and I spent most of it sitting in
&gt;Charlies.  :-)

Hi...
hope you don't mind a question from a USD-escapee...
<p>
Have any of you used WebWhacker or know anything about it?  I've seen 
information about it online--it downloads html files from online for 
viewing on computer without being online.  I wonder if it acts as its own 
browser as well or if you still need Netscape or other browser to view 
the files on the computer....
<p>
Anyone?

Karen,
<p>
Good to hear from you!  The list "owner" is basking in sunny Mexico so you
can probably get away with a question from off-campus :-).
&gt;hope you don't mind a question from a USD-escapee...
&gt;
I've seen the software, downloaded it, but haven't actually used it yet
(TIME!)  If we don't hear from anyone else, I'll give it a try and let you
know about the browser part of the question.
<p>
Discussion on another list I'm on suggests it works very well for
"grabbing" html, graphics etc., and links as far as you want to go and
stores them in a useable form on your hard drive.
<p>
Interestingly, the discussion has gone on at LENGTH about the copyright
issues involved in doing the grabbing (fair use, . . . ).

The announced, special topic for the meeting is:

I'm not sure if we will have any "special speakers" at the meeting, except
for each of you who will be very special if you attend!

      -----&gt;  As an introduction to the topic:  &lt;-----
<p>
Most of us would agree that it is a violation of copyright to copy from a
Web page that is clearly marked as "Copyrighted, under no circumstances can
this material be copied for any reason!"
<p>
On the other hand, the most common practice on the Web is to link pages to
other Web pages.
<p>
  -- Maureen Battistella tells me there is a current court case in which
including a specific URL on a Web page, without permission, is being
challenged.
<p>
  - The way current GUI Web browsers work is to copy the contents of the
page into your computer's memory and generally onto the hard disk drive in
a cache.  Is this copying legal?
<p>
  -- To make the Web even more interesting, from a recent discussion on the
EDTECH listserv:

&gt;Subject:      Re: WebWhacker &amp; Copyright (was: Intranets (Web with no Web))
&gt;To: Multiple recipients of list EDTECH &lt;EDTECH@MSU.EDU&gt;
<p>
&gt;OUR WebSite isn't there for maximum possible exposure.  In fact, it is
&gt;technically a violation of federal law for anyone outside the US Government
&gt;to use it.
<p>
and from a follow-up message, also from Jim:
<p>
&gt;As I stated in my original message it is a violation OF FEDERAL LAW.  For
&gt;those who want to know the picky details, it's Title 18, US Code, which
&gt;states (in part) that "All DoD interest computer systems and related
&gt;equipment are intended for the communication, transmission, processing, and
&gt;storage of official U.S. Government or other authorized information only"
&gt;and restricts such use to DoD or other authorized government personnel.
<p>
The point was that even though their Web site is not behind a firewall, nor
password protected, it is against Fed. Law to look at it.

<p>
Hi all:  I'm sitting here hoping that I can backtrack on my off the cuff
comment to Dale.  There was some news brief in one of five weekly rags I
receive that mentioned bringing charges against the author of The
Stalker's Home Page for linking to www.abii.com.  Abii is the Omaha
company that puts out ProPhone (or SelectPhone?) CDROM products. 
<p>
Abii argued that the Stalker's link mis-represented their product by 
association with a negative resource.  Further the link provided 
unauthorized access to Abii's proprietary data and search engine.
<p>
I'll keep looking for this brief as the possibility of asking for 
permission before linking externally is quite daunting.  I don't think I'll 
contact the Stalker to inquire though if I can't find it.

Just a reminder that the Web Users Group meeting is on for

  this Friday noon (May 31).   We'll meet again in Education 107.
<p>
The agenda is copyright questions and as a special treat, Heidi will show
slides of her vacation (that's a joke, I think, but if she has a few on her
Web page already, I suppose we could take a look at them).
<p>
Of course, there will be time for other items (e.g. a follow-up on password
access for dial-in PPP?)

	This is not a change.  This is the way things have always worked.  the
domain usd.edu is set up so that any mail addressed to xxxxx@usd.edu will first
be delivered to charlie (if xxxxx has an acount on charlie) then to the suns. 
So if you only have an account on charlie or only have an account on the Suns
there is no problem.  However if you have an account on both the mail will be
delivered to charlie, but if you do mail forwarding from charlie to the suns
everything still works.  So for most people xxxxxxx@usd.edu is a valid e-mail
address and will work just fine.

Hi all:
<p>
The satellite conference I attended last year was called "Multimedia Fair
Use", and organized by the Consortium of college and University Media
Centers.  The executive director, Don Reit, says that there are approximately
40 organizations participating in drafting guidelines for new areas if
copyright protection.  The draft guidelines are to be finalized this
summer and presented to congress at that time.  The consortium expects
to have an implementation satellite conference in early 1997.
<p>
Reit is sending a copy of the draft guidelines (they are not on the net).
When I receive them, I will put them on reserve at the Lommen Health
Sciences Library circulation desk along with the material from the
1995 satellite conference and let all of you know.
<p>
I hope that this is helpful.
<p>

**Cyberspace Law for Non-Lawyers** -- If you've wondered about
  legal issues that relate to the Internet and wondered about the
  validity of free legal advice from people who play lawyers on the
  net, check out a free electronic course being presented by the
  Cyberspace Law Institute and Counsel Connect. It starts today and
  will be run via email at the rate of three messages per week. The
  mailing list is one-way only, but its Web site provides a
  discussion area. The course covers six areas of law: copyright,
  privacy, trademark, libel, free expression, and contracting. The
  course does focus on United States law but still might interest
  folks in other countries. To subscribe, send email to &lt;listproc-

I have a question about URLs and html file names, and the way they interact.
<p>
<p>
My personal web page is at <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek/mmarek.html">http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek/mmarek.html</a>
<p>
How do I arrange the file names, etc, so that this location can be 
reached by entering only:  <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek">http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek</a>
<p>
I am interested in the same kind of addressing for the USD Foundation 
page, which is at <a href="http://www.usd.edu/foundation/alumni.html">http://www.usd.edu/foundation/alumni.html</a>
<p>
I'd rather have the address be <a href="http://www.usd.edu/foundation">http://www.usd.edu/foundation</a>
<p>
It is my impression, at least, that this is possible.

&gt; How do I arrange the file names, etc, so that this location can be 
&gt; reached by entering only:  <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek">http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek</a>
<p>
This can be done by naming a file index.html.
<p>
For instance, in your web directory of your personal account (mmarek), 
rename the file you want to be the default file to index.html. Then the 
address you gave above (<a href="http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek/">http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek/</a>) will be valid.
<p>
This will prevent you from looking at a listing of your directory through 
a web browser. In other words, if you have a directory which you would 
like to be able to view in a browser, you cannot have an index.html file 
in that directory (and the directory permissions must be 755!).
<p>
Hope this helps.

<p>
All come and let Carol Lushbough give you an introduction to Java.
<p>
She has promised to show some examples, and I'm guessing that she will be
willing to answer questions.  She DID NOT say anything about coffee being
available!  Anyway, I think it will too warm outside.
<p>
My regrets (so no one thinks I don't want to hear what she has to say),
I'll be out of town.  In my absence, I have confidence that Heidi will be
more than happy to introduce Carol and make sure that any other discussion
leaves time for Carol.  (Right, Heidi?)

Will JavaScript be discussed (as well as Java)?
I have put one example of JavaScript on the USD Press home page
(<a href="http://www.usd.edu/~usdpress">http://www.usd.edu/~usdpress</a>). Check it out, bottom of screen.
My husband and I have found _The Complete Idiot's Guide to JavaScript_ by

No, JavaScript will not be discussed because I've never used it.  I've 
seen a few examples and I know some of the syntax resembles Java but that's 
about all I know about it.  Sorry :(

<p>
I have a question about URLs and html file names, and the way they interact.
<p>
<p>
My personal web page is at <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek/mmarek.html">http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek/mmarek.html</a>
<p>
How do I arrange the file names, etc, so that this location can be
reached by entering only:  <a href="http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek">http://www.usd.edu/~mmarek</a>
<p>
I am interested in the same kind of addressing for the USD Foundation
page, which is at <a href="http://www.usd.edu/foundation/alumni.html">http://www.usd.edu/foundation/alumni.html</a>
<p>
I'd rather have the address be <a href="http://www.usd.edu/foundation">http://www.usd.edu/foundation</a>
<p>
It is my impression, at least, that this is possible.

"Houston, we have a problem"
<p>
I recently started using Netscape mail and have been experiencing some
problems with setup options.  The following error message popped up after I
tried to set the program to read my mail and leave the messages on the server:
"The POP3 server (sunflowr.usd.edu) does not support UIDL which Netscape
needs to implement 'leave on server' and 'maximum messg. size'  To download
your mail turn off these options"
When I turned these options off, my mail was copied to my local hard drive
and removed from the server... which is not want I wanted!  One reason being
that the mail is not password protected on my local drive.
Does anyone have any experience with Netscape mail??  I normally use Pathway
but Netscape allows one to view image files in the message and link URLs.
What is 'UIDL?'

<p>
Do we have the capability at USD to offer any form of real time audio to
people who connect to our WWW sites?  What kind of hardware or special
software does it take?  How many people could connect to the audio at any
given time?
<p>
I am thinking about a specialized application for the Foundation or Alumni
Association that would need to provide real time continuous audio from a
specific source, as opposed to a "pre-recorded" digitized audio clip. 
<p>
Monaural low fidelity would be satisfactory for the application I have in
mind, but it would have to be a live continuous audio feed.
<p>
If we can't do that, do we have the capability to have pre-digitized
audio, say a minute or two in length?  Again, what special equipment would
be need that is not currently available?

<p>
Dear Friends,
Have any of you used the internet to maintain class discussions?  I had in 
mind something like a guestbook to which I and my students could post 
questions and comments about given topics.  But, as far as I've determined, 
setting up a guestbook involves putting cgi or perl files in the system 
directory, and I'd rather try something that will not involve any work by 
the system administrators if possible.  Is it difficult to set up a 
discussion list?

Setting up a guestbook does not involve any work by the system
administrators, but you do need to do a little cgi programming.
<p>
Check out the guestbook I created for the Over Museum home page at
&lt;<a href="http://www.usd.edu/whom">http://www.usd.edu/whom</a>&gt; and the list I made for students to add links
relevant to class topics at &lt;<a href="http://www.usd.edu/esci/vp">http://www.usd.edu/esci/vp</a>&gt;.  I also have
sample interactive exams on the web at &lt;<a href="http://www.usd.edu/esci/exams">http://www.usd.edu/esci/exams</a>&gt;.
<p>
I'd be happy to give you a hand at getting started or give a presentation
on cgi/perl (what little I know about it) to the users group.

I have been using a web page counter from www.digits.com for the USD
Foundation page.  It has a graphic appearance that I like, but it seems
that more often than not I get "BUSY" back, instead of a count.
<p>
Does anyone have an opinion about what the most reliable counter is?

<p>
cgi counter on your own home page.
there are several public domain one available.
you only have to change the address for the location of the files within the
perl scripts.
set up some log files and change permissions.
and finally add a line to the page you want to count.
<p>
take a look at <a href="http://www.usd.edu/trio">http://www.usd.edu/trio</a>  (bottom of the page)
<p>
if you think this is good enough I can send you the scripts.
or I suppose I could set up a page with description on how to do this.
(Might take a day or two to find the time.)
<p>
let me know what you think?????

I used the counter in question on my home page and on the Farber Fund

same counter found on USD's home page.  You can use it on your page by

Use the counter from WebTools which executes on the university's server. 
 The University home page, mine, and many others here use it and I have 
found it perfectly reliable.  Just click on the number to go to WebTools 
for instructions.

<p>
Clayton,
<p>
I've recently set up (OK, Joe Collette recently set up *for* me &lt;g&gt;) a
listserv for the A&amp;S Internet classes I'm teaching.  I don't yet know how
well that will go, and I suspect (from other teachers' comments I've read)
that it won't go as well as I hope.  I know others at USD have set up
listservs for their classes--how did those work out, folks (Brian?)?
<p>
I'm planning on some *required* postings to the list, which will increase
list traffic, natch, but may or may not increase actual discussion.
<p>
If you've received answers by private email, Clayton, I'll bet there are
several of us who'd appreciate a summary to webula-l! 
<p>
Cheers,
Heidi

I set up a list for one of my classes, but it was used by only a small
handful of students who were already internet addicts.  It will take some
incentive to create widespread participation I'm afraid.

<p>
I forgot to tell write down two steps.
so there is a new step 10 and 11 (I think)
If you are actually trying this look at the page again.
after you create the cgi-bin directory the permissions need to be changed.
--- and you need to change into that directory (that is where the files get
copied)
<p>
sorry for the slip.
<p>
if anyone actually tries this and it works (or doesn't work) let me know.
I actually went through the instructions about a dozen times before I

Subject: server side
<p>
just a quick note to share some info about server side include commands
(ssi). Maybe everyone already knows this works but anyway....
<p>
I was talking to Joe R. a couple of days ago and the subject of ssi came up.
The last time I tried they didn't work (maybe I typed something wrong).
Anyway ssi does work now (probably has for a long time).  You can
dynamically update your pages as they are being written 
 ----- with no programming -----  
copy any of these to a html document and they will print out their
corresponding data set in text on your page dynamically. 
<p>
you can add cgi programming (perl, c, etc.) to update log files, databases
and process this info if you really wanted to.
<p>
TRY IT OUT --- make a html document and view it from netscape. I'd tell you
where my test page is but you wouldn't be able to view the source code
because it SUBSTITUTES the real data you ask for.

I have recently upgraded the USD web server to a newer version of httpd
(1.5.2a). You may have noticed some hiccups while I was configuring it. I
hope this didn't cause any major problems. At the last meeting we
discussed problems with browsers locking up when USD web pages are
accessed. I have hopes this upgrade might fix that problem. If anyone
notices better (or worse) performance, let me know about it.

One problem that was definitely fixed was the issue of using server side
includes which referenced environment variables. Several months ago Yaw
and I developed a "footer" page to include on almost all USD pages. It
contains a table with a link back to the USD home page, and code showing
when the page was last updated. Unfortunately, this caused pages including
it to break (broken images, document contains no data, etc...). Well, with
this server upgrade, the footer page now works.

So, if you would like to use the USD footer, you can put the following
code at the bottom of your page:

<TABLE WIDTH="600" ALIGN="CENTER">
<TR>
<TD WIDTH="300" ALIGN="LEFT">
<A HREF="http://www.usd.edu/"><IMG SRC="/gifs/usd/homepage/logo-small.gif" BORDER=0 HEIGHT="36" WIDTH="86" align=middle Alt="USD Home Page"></A>
</TD>
<TD ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="300">
<A HREF="http://www.usd.edu/accounts/quick.cfm"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" COLOR="#AA0000">Directory</FONT></A><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.usd.edu/search"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="3" COLOR="#AA0000">Search</FONT></A></TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
</BODY>
</HTML>


The footer contains the </BODY> and </HTML> tags, so you don't need any
more code after that line. If you would like to see pages using this
footer, check out the bottom of most USD pages, for instance
http://www.usd.edu/usd/usd.html.

I plan on making other include pages with different (more, less)
information. If you have suggestions or problems, please post them.

This message has 2 questions.

First of all, I was curious if anyone knows a good place to
find all of the possible arguments for the configuration formats. I came
across a good tutorial on SSI a while back:

<http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/docs-1.5/tutorials/includes.html>

but I couldn't find the possible arguments for sizefmt, timefmt, and
errmsg. Here are the ones I know for timefmt:

%a for abbreviated day of the week (for example Thu)
%A for full day of the week (for example Thursday)
%b for abbreviated month of the year (for example Oct)
%B for full month of the year (for example October)
%d gives day of the month (for example 26)
%e same as above (got this from Brad's message -- Thanks Brad)
%D gives the date as mm/dd/yy (for example 10/26/96)
%y gives the year number (for example 96)
%Y gives the full year number (for example 1996)
%T gives the time of day (for example 12:10:25)

I see that Brad and Dale have found some others as well. Is there a good
place to find all arguments? I might also suggest this would be a good
topic of discussion at the next meeting.

Question two is related to the new server. I've heard from two people
about performance on the new server. One (a Win95 user) reports she is now
having problems that didn't happen before. The other (a Mac user) says his
problem has now been fixed. I would appreciate more messages (to myself or
the list) telling me if you have seen a change in performance for USD web
pages.

Signing yet another lengthy message,
Joe Reynoldson

Brad,

I finally got around to going through the process on your web page to
implement a counter on the USD Foundation WWw page, and I have run into a
problem.  I believe I went through each step correctly, but I get a broken
graphic image.

One step I'm not sure of might be the problem, when editing the count.cgi 
file:

# ----------------------- RIGHT HERE ------------------------
#
#  $serverRoot=  "/usr/local/www/*******";
#  $serverRoot=  "/home/coyote/*******/www";
#
#
#     change the following line using one of the two options above
#       where ******** is your account name
# -------------------------------------------------------------

   $serverRoot = "/usr/local/www/foundation";
  
This is the name of the directory, however I have ownership of that
directory under my mmarek account.  Did I edit this correctly?

Beyond that, I am not sure where the problem might have been.  For most of
the commands listes on your WWW page, I just marked and copied, so I don't
think there were any typos.  <shrug>

Any ideas you might have would be helpful.

I went back and double checked all of them, and apparently had missed
changing the chmod of one of the counter files.  It is working now.

I've written a web program for uploading files from PC that some people
might be interested in.  I use it to upload practice exams that I write
almost daily for my students.  You can check it out from my exam page at
http://www.usd.edu/esci/exams/  or put the following form on one of your
web pages to call the program yourself (substituting your own preferred
default directory and filename):

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://www.usd.edu/esci/cgi-bin/upload.pl">
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="dir" VALUE="/usr/local/www/esci/temp">
<INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="file" VALUE="upload.tmp">
<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Upload File"></FORM>

One problem I've encountered in using this program is that the owner of
the uploaded files is "daemon" rather than myself, so either the directory
has to be owned by daemon or have global write priv's.  Does anyone know a
way around this (other than recopying the file after upload)?

The program works well as is for my current purposes, but the ownership
problem makes setting things up a little complicated.  The program
requires the cgi-lib.pl routines, and I've modified my copy to remove the
^Z that is often attached to the end of DOS text files created by word
processors.

After you set up the scripts - etc. before the files are created type this in

touch filename

this will create an empty file name and make you the creator.

(picked this up from Joe C. at one of the webula meetings.)

I guess i responded too fast to that last question.

 I tried the program and it is easy to set up etc.
I changed the program several ways: tried the touch (inside the program),
tried copying to an exsisting filename and then changing the filename, plus
a couple of other variations.

Basically what I found is that when the program (Netscape) is used to
upload the file, it rewrites any exsisting creator information entered
PRIOR to the execution of the script. (becomes DAEMON)

sorry for the inconvienence

It's not hard to change the ownership after the fact, though.  A mv
command leaves ownership the same, but cp makes the user the owner of the
copy.  A simple unix program could change ownership via a single command.

The only problem is leaving global write access to the directory, though
this could be changed before and after uploads.  Another solution is to
have the daemon create the directory it will be using so that only it has
write priv's, then use web programs to do all the manipulation.  By next
semester I'll have a practice exam question editor running that students
can use to add practice questions to web exams, and this will be my
obvious solution.  That way the web program is controlling what can and
can't be done, and I doubt anyone will go to the trouble to write a web
program specifically to do damage to my filespace.  But any valuable
documents should have backup copies elsewhere just to be safe.

Subject: November meeting

The November Web Users Group meeting is scheduled for:


  Thursday, Nov. 21, Noon - 1 pm in Education 110


Joe Reynoldson suggested that server-side includes (SSI) would be a good
topic for discussion, so I have asked him if he would be willing to lead
the discussion and present any information he would like about the
topic--he said OK.  If you haven't given them (SSI) a try yet, they do very
easily solve a few problems with Web pages.  Bring your questions and
examples of how you are using them.

There will be the usual open discussion and probably updates from CSCI
about what is and will be happening with the Web server.  Maybe we will
find about about the soon coming requirement of ID/password for PPP
dial-in.

I'm always interested in suggestions for special topics for meetings and
advice about when to schedule the meetings.  For example, would a standing
day and time be better or should we stay with the floating-day approach.

By the way, suggesting a topic does not obligate you to present or lead the
discussion.  On the other hand, volunteers are always appreciated.

Dale

Does this mean that we can put powerpoint files on our web pages?

Heidi Nickisch brought to my attention today that the server was not
configured to server power point files correctly. I added it to the
mime.types file as application/mspowerpoint with the standard extension of
.ppt. If there are other standard extensions for power point that you
think I should add, or if the application name I chose causes problems for
you, please let me know.

This means the web server can serve Power Point files. If you link to a
power point file, it will send the file to the client with the correct
mime information preceding it. This way, the client understands what type
of data is coming and it can figure out how to process it (usually with a
helper app, plugin, or a prompt to the user).
