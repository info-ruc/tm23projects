Hello again wind erosion list members!  The wind erosion list has about 100
members but seems very quiet.  I hope everyone is receiving the messages.  I
realize many of the members are not actively involved in wind erosion
research but are still interested in what may be happening in the wind
erosion research area.   But who is now actively involved in wind
erosion-related research and what are the research areas?  Does anyone have a
home page describing their work?

I am Dr. Ted Zobeck, a soil scientist with the USDA, Agricultural Research
Service in Lubbock, Texas.  Our research unit has a home page under
construction at http://lbk131.ars.usda.gov/weru/weru.html.  We will be adding
many new things to the page in the future.  

My general research assignment is to improve our understanding of the effect
of soil
properties on wind erosion. Specifically, this research includes the (1)
development of an
understanding of the relation of wind- induced soil movement and its impact
on PM-10 (dust)
generation and transport, nutrient movement and soil productivity; (2)
development of models
describing changes in near-surface bulk density; aggregate size distribution,
density, and
stability; and surface microrelief as influenced by cropping, tillage and
climatic variables; and
(3) development of models describing surface crust thickness, density,
stability, and the
amount of loose erodible material on the crust as influenced by rainfall and
soil properties. 

I would welcome others to share their interests and/or current projects.  It
will only take a minute and may generate some interesting dialog.

Cheers,
Ted
