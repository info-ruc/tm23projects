Hi !
You'll find the jumper settings at Asus' webserver: www.asus.com.tw
Here are the settings for 3*40Mhz that have been posted in this group:


Configuration:
   Board:    ASUS VL/I-486SV2GX4 Rev 2.0
   CPU:      AMD Am486-120 (SV8B) CPU
   BIOS:     Award BIOS 401A0-0401
   L2 Cache: 32k*8 * 8 (15nsec)
   DRAM:     One 16 Mb SIMM (60 nsec)

Jumper settings:
    clock frequency set to 40Mhz
    1 VL-Bus wait state

   JUMPER       |
----------------+--------------------
CPU:            |
     JP 5       | 1&2
     JP 6       | 1&2 both short
CPU selection:  |
     JP 11      | 2&3 short
                |
Short for:      |
     JP 16:     | 1&2 5&6
     JP 17:     | 1&2 5&6
     JP 18:     | 1&2
     JP 19:     | 1&2 3&4 5&6
     JP 20:     | open
     JP 21:     | 3&4 for L1 WB (DMA-problem --> NO floppy access)
                | 1&2 for L1 WT (ok)
     JP 22:     | 1&2 4&5

BIOS settings:
    As fast as possible (NO waits, in both cases)
    It does'nt make any difference how i set the L2 Cache.
    (OFF/L2-WT/L2-WB[with or without dirty])

Hope it'll help you.


Ciao
     Markus
