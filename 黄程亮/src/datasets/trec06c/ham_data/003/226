Folks,

The reflectors seem to be working just fine. I hope you have time to give them 
a whirl sometime in the near future. I am trying to stay online as much as 
possible to facilitate experiementation.

To date we have had more than 50 connections to the various reflectors. Let's 
see how high we can make this number.

John Cambell in Colorado ask me for a configuration file for his reflector. 
Since the file is short, I am including it here for your information. Using 
this file, and the reflector application available at 
http://cu-seeme.cornell.edu/ you too can set up your own reflector and lighten 
the bandwidth load. The most important configuration is the one called 
UNICAST-REF. This directive tells the reflector application to "echo" 
connections from another reflector. This is what we are doing from 
vega.lib.ncsu.edu and sunsite.berkeley.edu. Any connection to either one of 
these reflectors get "echoed" to the other reflectors.

I will be updating the See You See A Librarian page 
(http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~emorgan/see-a-librarian/) with some more useful 
information, but I though you might like to know about a book I found. Its 
called _Internet TV wit CU-SeeMe_ by Michael Sattler (Sams.Net : Indianapolis, 
1995) ISBN: 1-57521-006-1. The book is okay, not indispensible, but it does 
provide good instructions about the technology and answers a lot of questions 
on how to use CU-SeeMe effectivley.

I had a nice chat with a person named Joh this morning. He was in the United 
Kingdom. He couldn't send video, but his audio was great. This stuff seems to 
be working.

Lastly, it may be a good idea to set up a time for discussion. While I am 
trying to be online as much as possible, what time is good for y'all to connect 
and give this stuff a spin? How about Wednesday, June 10, at 1 o'clock Eastern 
Standard Time?

Eric - I missed your meeting yesterday. I tried to get to the reflector
site today and I couldn't get through to either address. Are they only
available at specific times? Or, did I do something else wrong? Nothing
happened when I put the addresses in from your message.
