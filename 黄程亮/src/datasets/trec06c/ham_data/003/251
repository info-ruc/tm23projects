Hi all,

Have recently purchased a couple of cameras but often had trouble 
connecting to the reflectors, or there have been very few other people 
online.

I think we need to explore the possibilites for this type of technology; 
would like to see the project continue.

Regards,

Graham.

I believe this is a good idea too, and for the sake of argument, lets'
make this the standing "meeting" time.

After a bit of software tweeking, I believe I can be online almost all
the time. For a limited time I will try to hangout all day long.

Please be more specific. Can you suggest a plan?

Remember, if you connect to one reflector no one may be there. If you
then immediately connect to the other reflector it will give you an
error message (No response.) Wait about one minute and your connection
to the other reflector will be estabolished.

I like this idea. Can you think of a more formal proposal?

Yes, video and audio may be integrated into our WWW browsers, but they
will still need the video and audio hardware to drive the software. 
Where are all those multi-media PCs?

I am hesitant to widen the scope of this list at the present time.

Do you think you could set up a UNI-CAST reflector downunder? I would
require a Unix computer on fairly high speed connection. I can supply
you with the necessary configuration file.

Thank you for your support. There is no reason why you can't connect to
the reflectors and just hang out; you can wait for someone else to
arrive. If you are concerned about taking up unnecessary bandwidth, then
you can tell your CU-SeeMe program to stop sending audio and video. When
somebody does connect to the reflector, you should hear a clicking
sound. At that time you can start sending input.

Well, I can think of what See-You-See-A-Librarian would mean for 
general internet users, as a group of Librarians offering expertise to 
find what they want in a vast sea of [chaotic?] knowledge. I can't think 
of a higher value-added service, given the right tools and kinds of 
people at both ends. 

I would think that it would be advantageous for any company to relate 
itself with the project; and what better way for Connectix to showcase 
their affordable, widely available and easy-to-use technologies?

Come to think of it, White Pine (who sells Enhanced Cu-SeeMe) could get 
into the act too. 

Opinions?

After giving it some more thought and talking to a few people, this may
be a good idea, but I am not going to persue it. Thanks for the idea.

An Interview with Eric Lease Morgan

Director of the "See You See a Librarian" project at NCSU

By Robin Murphy, InterNIC Support Services

------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

See You See A Librarian is an experiment, directed by Eric Lease Morgan
at
North Carolina State University, to examine the use of CU-SeeMe
technology
in librarianship and information seeking. We conducted a brief interview
with Eric to ask him about his project, what role he sees for
videoconferencing in libraries, whether the library community is "ready"
for
videoconferencing. We also asked what advice he has for libraries
considering adopting the technology.

Eric can be reached directly for more information at
eric_morgan@ncsu.edu.

InterNIC: Can you provide a brief outline of your project? What gave you
the
idea for See You See A Librarian, and how did you go about implementing
the
project?

     ELM: Around Memorial Day I started asking myself how effective would
     the CU-SeeMe technology be in enhancing library services. Now-a-days,
     more and more real library work can be done by patrons without every
     coming to the library. Yet, there are times when a librarian's help is
     still needed to truely satisfy a patron's information need. It is a
     well known fact that communication is accomplished in many ways.
     Telephone communications offer immediacy but lack essential non-verbal
     aspects. Email mandates concise descriptions of problems. Face-to-face
     communication, even at a distance, could reduce the limitations of the
     email and telephone mediums. I began wondering whether or not
     face-to-face communications using some thing like CU-SeeMe would
     improve the ways librarians and their patrons could solve this problem
     - namely the problem of assisting patrons from remote distances.

     In an effort to learn more about CU-SeeMe, I used my desktop computer
     and started trying to connect to remote CU-SeeMe reflectors. To my
     dismay, most times, when connecting to these reflectors, I found nobody
     there. "How am I suppose to explore this technology, if I can't see
     anybody." Consequently, I decided to set up my own reflector(s) and
     formulate a plan. The plan, as described at
     http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/~emorgan/see-a-librarian/, has three parts:

       1. Feasibility - this part is/was intended to see how many librarians
          have the necessary hardware and software to use CU-SeeMe.

       2. Librarians on Librarianship - this part intends to focus
          discussions, using CU-SeeMe technology, on the issues of
          librarianship.

       3. Librarians Fostering Knowledge - this part was intended to explore
          the feasility of providing reference services to Internet patrons
          using CU-SeeMe.

     Finally, I gave my project a cute name, "See You See A Librarian," and
     sent an announcement to library-related mailing lists describing the
     project.

InterNIC: What type of support do you have for the project (i.e.
funding,
resources, etc.) and where did/does it come from? How many people are
involved on the management and operation of the project - from your
institution or from other institutions?

     ELM: The project has the support of both the administration at the NCSU
     Libraries where I am employed and people who administer the Sunsite
     computer at the University of California-Berkeley (Roy Tenent). Thus,
     there are only a small handful of people involved in the management of
     the project, maybe five.

     The CU-SeeMe technology supports three types of communication:
     one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. To facilitate one-to-many
     and many-to-many communication, there needs to be an intermediary piece
     of software called a "reflector." This program "reflects" CU-SeeMe
     connections to other people who are connected to the reflector(s).
     Furthermore, reflectors can be "connected" to each other, so that
     people connected to one reflector can see the people reflected to the
     other reflectors. There are two reflectors used in this project. One is
     located at the NCSU Libraries (vega.lib.ncsu.edu) and the other is at
     UC-Berkeley (sunsite.berkeley.edu).

InterNIC: Can you provide a brief statistical snapshot - number of
institutions participating, number of individuals participating,
demography
of participants (i.e. trends relating to geography, size or type of
institution, etc.)?

Are any of the participants not libraries or librarians?

     ELM: Once the project got started in July, anybody with the necessary
     hardware and software was encouraged to participate. During the first
     month of the project more than at least 300 connections were made,
     either to the reflector at sunsite.berkeley.edu or to the one at
     vega.lib.ncsu.edu. There were certainly more connections than this, but
     I was unable to consistently extract the number of users from the
     sunsite reflector.log file.

     Of the connections made, everybody, with the exception of one person,
     made more than one connection to the reflectors. One person connected
     more than 115 times.

     The most popular connection days were July 8th - 15th, and very few
     connections were made later in the month. Generally speaking, more
     connections were made in the afternoon (Eastern Time) than other times
     of the day.

     Some of the people connecting were from the United Kingdom and Mexico,
     but the majority of people were from the United States.

     Based on my observations all the participants were librarians, people
     who worked in libraries, or people who worked for the library community
     (consultants). Of the librarians, the mix was evenly divided between
     academic, special, and state-supported libraries.

     The sizes of the insitutions represented by the participants is not
     known.

InterNIC: Can you offer an analytical look at the use of the technology
in
the library field?

What do you see as potential areas of use for the technology in the
library
field? What do you perceive to be the major drawbacks to using the
technology - for the library field? What do you perceive as major
advantages?

     ELM: The advantages and disadvantages of interactive video conferencing
     (CU-SeeMe) in the library field are pretty much the same advantages and
     disadvantages when applied to other communication endeavours. For
     example, CU-SeeMe requires special hardware and software in order to
     work, specifically video technology (a video camera) and audio
     technology (a microphone) as well as a high-speed Internet connection.
     While the Internet connection is becoming less and less of a barrier,
     it seems that the video/audio is the major stumbling block. Many
     library administrations do not support librarians with this sort of
     hardware. At the same time, this is understandable since no real uses
     of this technology have been readily demonstrated.

     There are a couple of other problems with the technology. For example,
     CU-SeeMe makes people conscious of their appearence to others. This
     sometimes makes people shy and not want to participate. In the other
     extreme, there exist on the Internet exhibitionists who intrude into
     CU-SeeMe reflectors and detract from the reflectors' intended use.
     Additionally, it is quite possible to impersonate somebody else using
     CU-SeeMe and commit slanderous acts.

     On the other hand, if the necessary hardware were universally
     available, then video conferencing could be used in numerous ways in
     Library Land. The most obvious example from the patron's perspective is
     for reference queries. There are many times when it would be helpful to
     speak to a librarian. While telephone communications are useful, video
     conferencing would transmit the non-verbal aspects of the reference
     interview process and quite possibly improve the service. Since
     telephones are not available throughout libraries, video conferencing
     could extend reference services to the patrons in the "stacks" if a
     wireless network were available. Unfortunately, the few patrons I have
     talked to concering these sorts of ideas have not been impressed. The
     common response is, "I don't need CU-SeeMe to ask a reference question.
     I have a telephone for that." These people do not understand the
     subtleties of the reference interview.

     From a library-only point of view, CU-SeeMe could be used to facilitate
     the training of library staff in places where travel is difficult. For
     example the state library system of Florida is trying the use of
     CU-SeeMe for just this purpose. Since the state is so extensively
     rural, the state librarians are finding the use of CU-SeeMe as a way to
     provide in-services to remote librarians.

     Another alternative is to use CU-SeeMe as a medium for live debates.
     For example, about a month ago there was a raging debate on a popular
     library-related mailing list. The topic of the debate was whether or
     not to catalog Internet resources. Some advocated the idea and others
     did not. I invited four people to express their opinions concerning the
     topic in a formal debate. While the debate takes place, others can
     "lurk" to watch the debate. This concept would have worked for many,
     many people, even if they did not have a video camera. Unfortunately,
     again, the people I contacted to debate the issue did not have the
     necessary equipment to use CU-SeeMe.

InterNIC: Can you comment on the library field's "readiness" for
CU-SeeMe
and other videoconferencing and collaboration technologies?

For example, where is the library profession now? Where do the
profession
need to be to be, in terms of both the technology and the skills, to
really
employ this technology to their advantage? What needs to happen to get
the
library profession to that point?

     ELM: I believe the library community is ready for this sort of
     technology. I believe all librarians would see the inherent
     possibilities of CU-SeeMe. At the same time, libraries are notoriously
     under-funded; libraries are not money-making organizations.
     Consequently, the budgets of libraries are limited and currently do not
     allow for very many experiments. Similarly, like everybody else,
     libraries feel under- staffed and to bring on new services, like the
     use of CU-SeeMe, will mean the elimination of other services. "What
     services do we stop doing in order to provide this new one?"

     In order to make the use of CU-SeeMe a reality in any institution I
     believe a number of things need to happen. First, there must be a
     commitment on the part of the library administration to purchase the
     necessary hardware. Second, the administration of the institution the
     library must commit to making the necessary hardware available to their
     constituencies. For example, video cameras could be made standard
     equipment in college computing labs. Next, either more staff are needed
     to provide the newer services or other services have to be eliminated.
     Once this happens, libraries could regularly staff the "CU-SeeMe
     Stations," just as they staff the reference desk, and field remote
     reference queries.

InterNIC: It appears that your project is initially aimed at providing
an
interactive platform for professional collaboration in the library
field.
How receptive have librarians been to the idea of using the technology
for
this purpose?

Have you found that the interactive nature of the technology enhanced
the
collaboration process over, say, simple email exchanges?

     ELM: In general, librarians have been positive regarding the use of
     this technology, but the vast majority of them do not have the
     necessary hardware to participate. Additionally, even when given the
     opportunity to borrow the necessary hardware they are sometimes
     reluctant to participate since they have little time for
     experimentation.

     At this time, there is not enough experience from the project to know
     whether or not the "technology enhanced the collaboration process over,
     say, simple email exchanges."

InterNIC: There can be little doubt that the Internet, particularly
tools
such as electronic mail and distributed information systems such as the
World Wide Web, have had tremendous import for the nature of library
work -
how libraries conduct their business and carry out their missions, what
that
business and that mission is, and what is consequently required of the
professionals in the field.

Do you see CU-SeeMe and videoconferencing in general as having the same
type
of impact? Why or why not?

     ELM: While desktop video conferencing has the potential of enhancing
     library services quite a bit, I do not see desktop video significantly
     transforming library services. Libraries are about collecting,
     organizing, archiving, disseminating, and sometimes evaluating
     information. The use of CU-SeeMe or some other video conferencing
     technology only effects one aspect of those services (the dissemination
     process).

     Furthermore, I would personally like to see the realm of library
     services move from information mediation to knowledge mediation. The
     computer has enabled more and more people to acquire their own
     information without the use of a library. The real skill librarians
     posses is the ability to evaluate information. This evaluation process
     facilitates knowledge and I would like to see librarianship move in a
     more aggressive manner towards these goals.

InterNIC: What advice or suggestions would you give a library
considering
the use of CU-SeeMe or other videoconferencing technology to deliver
traditional library services?

     ELM: If I were to implement a full scale plan to incorporate something
     like CU-SeeMe into library services, I would:

       1. Equip a goodly number of librarians with the necessary hardware
          and software.

       2. Mandate the librarians experiment with the hardware and software
          for a limited period of time knowing that new services were going
          to be implemented on a specific date in the future.

       3. Advertise, advertise, and then advertise the service to the
          intended beneficiaries of the service.

       4. Get the University's administration or computing center to equip
          computing labs with the necessary hardware and software to use
          CU-SeeMe.

       5. Bring up the service on the predefined date.

     In summary, I believe video conferencing can be used effectively in
     library settings. Unfortunately, even though librarians work in
     learning/teaching/academic/exploration settings, it is difficult for
     librarians to act in learning/teaching/academic/exploration modes. It
     is difficult not because librarians don't have the necessary skills,
     but rather there seems too little time for these sorts of activities.
     It may seem oxymoronic, but change is the norm. All institutions must
     think about change and how to cope with it. Until this happens,
     innovations will not be explored with very much rigor unless they are
     thrust upon us by outside forces. Hopefully we, as well as other
     professions, can learn to adjust.

At the end of this month or soon after I will be turning off the
reflectors. In the meantime I will be writing up the final report. The
report will include full access to the archives of this mailing list. 

Additionally, since *people* are the real sources of information, I
would like to include the names and email addresses of the this list's
membership so future readers can identify people who are interested in
video conferencing technology.

If you would NOT like to have your name and email address included in
the final report, then please email me personally and I will make is so.

Does anyone have a resource list of other library-oriented CU-SeeMe
projects or reports that are ongoing?  Or know of web sites related to
similar library-of-the future technologies?  I  would like to direct my
students to these sorts of resources to spark their imaginations and their
sense of what is possible in the libraries that they will be working in
soon.
