Subject: posting #1


Hi folks. This is the first posting to SEE-A-LIBRARIAN-L. The purpose of this
list is to operate as a communications device for the See A Librarian
project. Using this mailing list we can share our experiences using the
CU-SeeMe technology. Hopefully we will pass this stage easily and then begin
discussing how we can use CU-SeeMe (or some other technology) to provide
library/knowledge services. This mailing list will cease to exist when the
project concludes.

So far there have been about 100 connections to the reflectors at
vega.lib.ncsu.edu and sunsite.berkeley.edu. These two reflectors are
configured so that when someone connects to one reflector, people connected
to the other reflector see the first people. Understand? In short, having two
reflectors shares the load.

I exected many people don't have the necessary hardware, software, and time
to participate in this project. That is why I posted the "announcement" to so
many lists. From what lists did y'all hear about this project? I would like
to know since I plan to remind people of the project again in a couple of
weeks.

Finally, allow me to restate a few goals of the Project. Primarily, the
Project's purpose is simply to explore the use of this technology. From these
explorations other paths or new goals may present themselves; nothing is set
in stone here. Second, I consider the Internet's primary function to be
communication. Let's see how well this medium satisfies the communications
function.

By the time y'all read this you will most likely have come back from the 4th
of July weekend. Lets set up a particular time to try and get "together." How
about Tuesday, July 9th at 10 AM (EST) and/or Wednesday at 2 PM (EST)?

"CU online!"
