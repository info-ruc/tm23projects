Plan 9 Distribution

              
          

Contents

The Plan 9 distribution consists of two books, four 1.4 megabyte floppies, and a
CD-ROM. The two books contain the manual pages and a collection of papers
describing the system. Click on the cover pages for more information. 

The four floppies contain a complete bootable Plan 9 system for PCs. This includes
the kernel, a window system, Internet support, and programming environments for
both the C and Alef languages. The CD-ROM contains kernels, libraries, and
executable programs for the Intel 386 (including 486 and Pentium), Sparc, 68020, and
Mips architectures and the sources to create them. Click on the CD-ROM art for a list
of files on the CD-ROM. 

To find out if Plan 9 supports your hardware, read The Various Ports. 

Free Trial

Plan 9 does not purport to run on all PCs. Since Plan 9 does not use the BIOS, it is
sensitive to hardware differences between PCs. Therefore, we will provide the
contents of the four floppies on the Internet via FTP, free of charge. 

The document, Installing the Plan 9 Distribution, explains how to get going. 

To Order

The distribution will be available in mid to late July. At that time we will post here
both an 800 number for orders from within the USA and another number for those
from outside. The cost is $350 plus postage. The system is licensed for educational and
commercial use. 

The manuals can be ordered by themselves from the same telephone numbers. The cost
is $150 plus postage.
