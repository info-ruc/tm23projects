I'd finally convinced the company to buy Plan 9. So, they sent out the
purchase order to the guy who sources our stuff from the US (we're in
India), and he's got back to us saying that he's getting the manuals for
$437.50 and the whole package for $550 plus! Which, alas, is enough more
than the stated cost for the company to suddenly start questioning the
order all over again :(

Has the price changed or something? And, is it possible that he's
talking to a dealer who's charging him more? I thought it could only be
ordered from Harcourt Brace and Company at 800 782 4479.

Tell me what's up, please! After months of arguing ("yes, I know that
buying it is not justifiable commercially, but..."), to finally convince
them and then to have this happen is too much, even for a patient soul
such as I...
