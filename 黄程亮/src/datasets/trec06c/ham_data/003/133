Dear Mr. Touretzky,

     I have seen your posting soliciting copies of the NOTs pack
to be sent to you.  You are apparently under the mistaken
impression that it is possible to obtain a "legal" copy of these
materials.  This is false.  The only way that these materials
have *ever* left the custody of the few advanced Scientology
churches which are licensed to have them is through outright
*theft* for which the thief was arrested, convicted, and served
time in jail in Denmark.  

     In suits brought subsequent to that theft, courts ordered
all copies of those materials to be turned in to the courts.  If
anyone still has a copy of those materials, it is the fruit of
that theft and in violation of those court orders.  There is no
*legal* copy of these materials in existence.

     You are hereby put on notice that because these materials
are protected not only under copyright, but also trade secret
law, your *solicitation* of these materials is in violation of
the law, as would be your disclosure of them to others by
whatever means.  By your solicitation, you are also inducing
violation of the law by others.

     I am including at the end of this message the notice that I
posted to several newsgroups on March 22, 1996, containing the
TRO that was issued by the United States District Court for the
Northern District of California on March 21, 1996 against Grady
Ward and those acting in concert with him.  I repeat here that
you are on notice of this TRO.  If you engage in actions
prohibited by this TRO, you do so at your peril.  While we would
rather not have to litigate, we will take all necessary legal
actions to protect these intellectual properties. 

                                        Sincerely,
                                        Helena Kobrin


                       NOTICE TO READERS:

     On March 6, 1996, Grady Ward posted a message to the
Internet soliciting a NOTs pack.  In a later posting, Ward
indicated his intention for SCAMIZDAT to post the contents of
that pack to this and the other newsgroups this message has been
cross-posted to.  SCAMIZDAT has made similar threats.  The
materials known as New Era Dianetics for Operating Thetans, or
"NOTs" are confidential, unpublished works, protected by both
copyright and trade secret law.  

     The purpose of this posting is to inform you that on March
21, 1996 at 5:12 p.m., Judge Ronald M. Whyte of the United States
District Court for the Northern District of California issued the
following Temporary Restraining Order against Ward and SCAMIZDAT
prohibiting them and anyone in active concert or participation
with them from, among other things, acquiring, reproducing,
displaying these materials.  The full text of this Temporary
Restraining Order is below.

     Pursuant to Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure the form and scope of Injunction or Restraining Order
are:

     Every order granting an injunction and every
     restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its
     issuance; shall be specific in terms; shall describe in
     reasonable detail, and not by reference to the
     complaint or other document, the act or acts sought to
     be restrained; and is binding only upon the parties to
     the action, their officers, agents, servants,
     employees, and attorneys; and upon those persons in
     active concert or participation with them who receive
     actual notice of the order by personal service or
     otherwise.

     By this electronic communication, you are being formally
placed on notice of the above order and its terms.  As Ward and
SCAMIZDAT have solicited copies of the NOTs materials, your
attention is specifically called to the fact that the order
specifically prohibits, among other things, the acquisition of
the NOTs materials.

TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER
AND ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE RE:
PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION


     To Defendant GRADY WARD, his officers, agents, servants,
employees, and attorneys, and to those persons in active concert
or participation with him, including, but not limited to
SCAMIZDAT:
     Upon reading the Complaint on file in this action, the Ex
Parte Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and for Order
to Show Cause Re Preliminary Injunction, the Memorandum of Points
and Authorities, and the Declarations of Helena K. Kobrin and
Warren McShane and Exhibits in support thereof, it appears to the
satisfaction of this Court that there is good cause, and this is
a proper case, for granting a temporary restraining order. 
Pursuant to Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,
the Court finds as follows:
     1.   Plaintiff has established that it is probable that
plaintiff will prevail at trial on the merits of their claims for
relief against defendant; and
     2.   There is a likelihood that plaintiff will be
irreparably injured if this temporary restraining order is not
granted; or
     3.   Plaintiff has raised serious questions; and
     4.   The balance of hardship tips sharply in plaintiff's
favor in that the hardship to defendant if this temporary
restraining order is granted is outweighed by the hardship to
plaintiff if it is not granted.
     YOU ARE HEREBY ORDERED TO SHOW CAUSE at 9:00 a.m. on March
29, 1996, or as soon thereafter as counsel may be heard in the
courtroom of the Honorable Ronald M. Whyte, located at 280 South
First Street, San Jose, California 95113, why you, your agents,
servants, employees, partners, privies and attorneys, and all
persons acting or purporting to act under your authority,
direction or control, and all persons in active concert or
participation with you, or acting on your behalf, including, but
not limited to SCAMIZDAT, having advance notice of this Order
should not be enjoined during the pendency of this action from:
     1.   directly or indirectly, in whole or in part,
          publishing, reproducing, distributing, performing, or
          creating derivative works based upon the works listed
          in Exhibit C to the Complaint, also attached hereto
          ("Exhibit C Works"), or any of them, in any media now
          known or hereafter developed in any time, place or
          fashion, and in particular, from engaging in any such
          acts in, on, or in connection with any computer,

          storage facility, or archives, or other electronic or
          computer device, service, network or facility and that
          all such copies which defendant, his agents, servants,

     PENDING HEARING on the above Order to Show Cause, you, your

not limited to SCAMIZDAT, having advance notice of this order ARE
HEREBY RESTRAINED AND ENJOINED from:
     1.   directly or indirectly, in whole or in part,
          publishing, reproducing, distributing, performing, or
          creating derivative works based upon, the Exhibit C
          Works, or any of them, in any media now known or
          hereafter developed in any time, place or fashion, and
          in particular, from engaging in any such acts in, on,

          information service, electronic bulletin board service,
          network, storage facility, or archives, or other
          electronic or computer device, service, network or

          concert or participation with them have caused to be
          copied or copied onto any such device, service,

          such works, as set forth in 17 U.S.C.  107.
     2.   directly or indirectly, engaging in the further
          unauthorized disclosure, or display, of the Exhibit C
          Works, or portions thereof (excluding for purposes of
          this Order only NOTs Series issues 1, 24, 34, 35, 36
          and 42 which are also the subject of other pending

          displaying, transmitting or otherwise loading any of
          the Advanced Technology materials, or portions thereof
          (excluding for purposes of this Order only NOTs Series

          known or hereafter developed in any time, place or
          fashion, or onto any computer, database, information
          service, electronic bulletin board service, network,
          storage facility, or archives, or other electronic or
          computer device, service, network or facility and that

          in active concert or participation with them have
          caused to be copied or copied onto any such device,
          service, network, or facility be removed.  (The fair
          use defense is not applicable to this paragraph, as it
          is based upon plaintiff's contention that the documents
          are protectable as trade secrets.)
     3.   directly or indirectly, engaging in the further
          unauthorized solicitation and/or acquisition, of the
          Exhibit C Works, or portions thereof (excluding for
