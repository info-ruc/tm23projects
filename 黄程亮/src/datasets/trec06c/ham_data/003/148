	The settings I came up with are based on the AMD Enhanced 120's.  The cpu's
pin assignments are basically the same, the only difference seems to be what
the the state of the input does to the chip.  (clock multiplication and
cache settings).  I'm confident I've enabled L1 write back cache.  These
settings are still preliminary as I'm still waiting for the latest bios, but
at present I'm running overclocked at 160Mhz and this $70 dollar chip is
outperforming the $270 Pentium Overdrive 83 Mhz chip in every category
including CPU 16 and 32 mark. (using winbench 96).   I'm not sure it will
last at 160Mhz, but the replacement of it won't be that expensive if it does
give in.  I know the next one will always work at 133Mhz.  If these settings
can be changed, I'm welcome to suggestions as I don't claim to have all of
the answers.  They are proven on my system.

Bios settings:

Auto Config       Disabled                             
Fast Reset Emul   Enabled
AT Bus Clock      1/4 CLKIN(1/5 for 160 Mhz)  
DRAM Speed        Fastest                     
DRAM Write WS     0WS                         
DRAM Write CAS    1T

DRAM Write Burst  Enabled
Slow Refresh      Disabled
Hidden Refresh    Enabled

L2 Cache Scheme      Write Back
L1 Cache Scheme      Write Back
Cache Burst Read     1T
Cache Write Cycle    2T
Video Shadow         Non-cache
Memory Hole          Disabled
Fast Reset Latency   2 usec
Latch Local Bus      T2
Local Bus Ready      Transparent for 133Mhz
                     Sychronize for 160Mhz
Jumper Settings:

JP5      1+2 short
JP6      1+2 short
JP11     2+3 short
JP16     1+2, 4+5 short
JP17     1+2, 5+6 short
JP18     1+2 short
JP19     2+3, 4+5 short
JP20     1+2 short for 4x clock, All open for 3X clock
JP21     3+4 short  (should be write back cache), Open for write thru
JP22     1+2, 4+5 short
JP23, JP24, JP25   33Mhz for 133 operation, 40Mhz for 160 operation
JP26     2+3 short
JP28     1+2 short for 133Mhz, 2+3 short for 160Mhz
JP29     1+2 short for 133Mhz, 2+3 short for 160Mhz
JP32     1+2 short

Just let me know if this worked for you.
ASUS can give me a job!
