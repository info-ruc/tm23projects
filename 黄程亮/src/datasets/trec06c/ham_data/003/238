> Eric - is the version of CuSeeMe on your web site for PowerMacs only? I
have a Mac LC575 and can't seem to get that version to work. Thanks

No, I don't t think the version of CU-SeeMe on the  See A Librarian home page
is for PowerMacs only. If in doubt, try the home page of CU-SeeMe at:

  http://cu-seeme.cornell.edu

Tell us what happens.

Subject: Powerbook question

As of yesterday, I no longer have my Mac LC575 in my office. That has gone
on to someone else in the building. I now use my Mac Powerbook 5300cs plus
a monitor and keyboaRD to use when I'm in my office. I have just been told
that I can't use CuSeeMe with a Powerbook. If this is true, I will have to
go to the other end of the floor and borrow someone else's Mac to
videoconf. with all of you. Any verification of this situation? Thanks.
