    Yes, I am unable to write functioning TCP code and
    I've done it at least three times, never the same bug
    ...

don't get peeved phil.  i thought i'd get an informed response here.
asking the question of my dubious internet service provider would
probably get nowhere.  i suspect their side.  certainly the 100ms
from sydney to perth and then 100ms to sydney again doesn't help.
yes, they have no local internet connection.
