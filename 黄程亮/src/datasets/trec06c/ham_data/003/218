Ordering directly from HCB in the USA from Germany last August was no
problem.  They accepted my credit card number, the parcel arrived a
few days later for the price they quoted (in US-$ + local German VAT,
which is charged through UPS or whoever does the final delivery.)

BTW: Though 800-number cannot be called directly from Germany, it works
if you use an US calling card (I'm not sure whether I used AT&T or Sprint).
