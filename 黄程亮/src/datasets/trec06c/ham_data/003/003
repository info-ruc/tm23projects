Here's a quick and dirty hack for plan 9 eqn, to stop it from
inserting font changes in the middle of unicode characters.
Edit /sys/src/cmd/eqn/text.c, find the function trans(), and
change both occurrences of "isalpha(c)" to "(isalpha(c) || (c&0x80))".
mk installall.  You can now use all those Greek letters in
equations without spelling them out!  (hey, it's almost WYSIWYG :-)
