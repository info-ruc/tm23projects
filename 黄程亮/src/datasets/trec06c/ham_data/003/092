In response to Eric Hurley's note of September 15 -- While I was
stationed with ARS at the University of Wisconsin, Madison in the
late '60's, early '70's, farmers of the Central Sands area were
ripping out their shelterbelts to make room for their new center
pivots to operate.  Dean Pound's office became concerned, and we
had a wind erosion committee for awhile.
 
Looking into the literature, I found that the earliest bulletin
on wind erosion in Wisconsin was written by F. H. King in 1894, I
think it was.  I got the last copy that the UW bulletin
distribution room had, carried it around awhile, then gave it to
the ARS wind erosion lab at Manhatten, KS -- hope they still have
it.  That 1894 bulletin appeared almost modern in the issues it
was discussing - and the pictures could have been taken
yesterday.
 
Neal Woodruff brought his portable wind tunnel and crew to
Wisconsin.  He and his crew, Art Peterson of the UW Soils
Department, and I spent a week running the tunnel in various
places.  I remember working in the Hancock and Tomah areas, and
there may have been some measurements in between.  We wrote up
the results of the tests in a local, paperbacked bulletin that is
probably long gone.  Gary Bubenzer may have a copy.  The Dean's
office was happy, and the committee was disbanded.
 
Just thought you might find this interesting, Eric.  Say hello to
Gary for me if he is not a lurker.
