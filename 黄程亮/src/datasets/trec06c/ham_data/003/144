Hey John,

I'm in the process of upgrading my BIOS and getting the 133Mhz processor
to run at 160Mhz.  Here is my current thread to two other people about the
process.  Once I have ALL the details, I plan on making a master GX4
upgrade document and posting it on the ASUS newsgroup.

Could you give the technical specs a once-over and let me know if you
dis-agree with anything?

I greatly appreciate it and I'll talk to you soon!

Here's something I read in a post recently:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Hi
I've seen numerous requests for information on how to set the jumpers
correctly for this combination.  I received two of these processors this
weekend, and managed to get them going using the following jumper
settings:

JP16:	1-2 4-5
JP17:	1-2 5-6
JP18:	1-2
JP19:	1-2 3-4 5-6
JP20:	1-2
JP21:	2-3
JP22:	1-2 4-5

If you leave JP20 open the CPU runs in clock trebling mode instead of
clock quadrupling mode.  You could experiment and try to get it to work
as a 3*50MHz system.  Both CPUs ran flawlessly at both 133MHz (4*33MHz)
and 160MHz (4*40MHz).  The only problem I did encounter was that QEMM
7.5 hung when it started, no matter what the speed of the CPU was.
I think it has something to do with QEMM identifying the CPU incorrectly.
Cheers

The SV8 and SV8 stuff only applied to the 80-120 Mhz processors.  The 133
has and ADZ somewhere I think.

Not sure.  I use write-back and have everything except for a SCSI card.

At 40Mhz, I have the VESA delay enabled.  It may work without it at 33Mhz.

The same setting should allow you to run at 133 and 160- you just have to
change the bus speed (from 33 to 40).  Compare the settings from the
beginning of this message to the differenct cpu setting from the manual.
I think it's closest to the AMD486DXL4 - 2x clock- you may not have to
change the jumpers much. :)  There may be one jumper different- the one
that enables internal write-back.

Also, be warned that at 160Mhz (4x40), my GX4 boots up and says 150Mhz.

Good luck.
