Can anyone give me the specifications for a video camera to work with 
CUSeeMe?  Can you recommend a place to purchase this?  The price I got on 
a digital video camera is $859 and on a video camera with standard NTSC 
output is $495.  I wonder if this is typical or not.  Any information you 
could provide would be very helpful and appreciated.  Thanks.

Subject: Powerbook

I got into the two reflector sites but I can't see anyone else and it says
zero participants. I don't know if there just isn't anyone participating
orif I'm starting to have trouble because I'm connecting with a Powerbook.
I will try again tomorrow.
