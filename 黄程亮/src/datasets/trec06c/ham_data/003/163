I have a Tekram DC380 SCSI adaptor, in the manual for this card is 
specifically says it does not support CPUs with write back cache.

Well, I tried setting the jumper to get Write Back, but neither 
system would boot up, I thought that at least the IDE system would 
work.

I also have a DX2/80 (actually an overclocked Intel DX2/66) and I had 
starnge problems running that when it was set to <33MHz, 0ws.  
Occasionally windows would get corrupted when moved around, or opened 
and closed, so I set it to >33Mhz, 1ws, and never had a problem 
since.  I was then able to set my DRAM access to FASTEST, and my 
SRAM to 2-1-1-1.

It depends which version of the bios you had.

I'll have a look out for them, and get back to you.  I'm running 
Novell DOS 7, by the way, not Win95.

OK, the 160MHz system has the following:
16MB 60ns DRAM
256K 15ns SRAM
Tekram DC380 VL SCSI adaptor
Cirrus Logic 5428 VL SVGA (2MB)
Sound Blaster 32 AWE
Intel EtherExpress 16 bit NIC
Microcom 28.8K internal modem
Non-Branded Serial / Parallel Game card
Conner CFP 1060MB SCSI-2 hard drive
Conner 420MB Tape Drive
Creative Labs Hex Speed CDROM
1.44MB stiffy drive

The 133MHz system has :
16MB 60ns DRAM
128K 15ns SRAM
Acer Enhanced IDE / Cirrus Logic 5430 VL Combo Card
IBM 1.7GB IDE hard drive
1.44MB stiffy drive
1.2MB floppy drive

Ditto!
