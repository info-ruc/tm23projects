For the past two weeks or so, I have been trying to connect to both 
reflectors, but I have found that one of both is always or almost always 
down. IMO, this has discouraged people from connecting.

However, there is truth in there not being, at least, a known base of 
librarians equipped to do 'full' cu-seeme. I am at a loss as to how to 
find those that are... 

How about getting Connectix to sponsor the project and supply it with, 
say, 10 QuickCams? (Crazy Idea)

   I have to agree. I think this is a great concept which time will 
come. My problem is  I can't quite convince my Director to 
spend the $ to get me up and running alone. 

  Eric, you're ahead of your time...
