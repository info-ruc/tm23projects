Dear Dan:

Ref:  "Info on the BONDING protocol" in "About ISDN" on your WWW page.

Let me introduce myself as the current Chairman of the BONDING Technical
Committee. Mr. H. Sharp who supplied the files on BONDING was the previous
chairman.  I am also Chief Technical Officer of Promptus Communications,
Inc. of Portsmouth RI which can be found in your existing ISDN page
references.  Thank you for maintaining the page.

I would like to point out that while the note on RFC 1618 is technically
correct, the RFC was written in 1994 and no subsequent action was referred
to the BONDING consortium for debate.  Since that time, BONDING has in fact
become the defacto worldwide standard for channel aggregation in video
conferencing using ISDN and is currently an ISO document (ISO IEC 13871).
It is also heavily used for interconnection of routers and/or  backup of
dedicated inter-router links.   As channel aggregation methodology is likely
to be a lively topic based on other recent RFCs like 1717,  I would hope
that you might append this information on your ISDN page and help include
the Bonding Consortium in future discussion on the Internet.  

An additional note that I think would be of interest to your readers.  The
September 26, 1995 issue of the Network Edition of PC magazine (Page NE12 on
"Working Together Using ISDN" )  referred to  BONDING as "an important
control protocol in ISDN channel aggregation" and then  without explanation
of BONDING or its advantages, chose to editorialize  by adding
"Fortunately, a standard is beginning to emerge: IETF's RFC 1717..." .  How
fortunate this is remains to be seen.  Emerging things can have problems.
Comments welcome.  Some of RFC1618 comments on BONDING are dealt with in
another ITU standard H.244 which defines simple extensions to the BONDING
method.   BONDING was created to provide an open standard (no license
required) for aggregation and in fact has done so due to the diligent
efforts of a number of  individuals and companies around the world.

My Email address is:  pfredette@ins.net  and I would appreciate receiving
commentary on the subject .
