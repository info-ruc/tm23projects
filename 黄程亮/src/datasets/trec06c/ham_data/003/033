Dear wind erosion and aeolian research colleagues,

I recently sent an e-mail to Dr. Dirk Goosens at the Katholic University of
Belgium at Leuven to open a dialogue on the dust work they have been doing
there.  I received in reply this shocking letter.  I believe we all
recognize the important work that has been done by Dr. Goossens and his
Israeli colleagues.  The loss of this research unit will be a blow to the
aeolian research community.  Please read Dr. Goossens letter and follow up
on his need for collegial support in his fight to maintain his position as
well as his research unit.

Sincerely,

John Gillies


>Dear Dr. Gillies,

>Thank you for your message. As you know we have established here in Leuven an 
>aeolian dust unit focussing on theoretical as well as on experimental 
>research (wind tunnel in Leuven + field sites in Israel). I welcome very much 
>your request to share research initiatives and research plans, but here is 
>the problem: our university recently decided, after a calculation of the 
>number of students in each faculty, to stop supporting the aeolian dust unit. 
>This means that, if the decision is confirmed in August, I will have to look 
>for a new job in September and the aeolian facilities in Leuven will be 
>degraded to industrial archaeology. I have worked 15 years on establishing 
>this research, starting from almost zero: it is my life-work. Now, after 15 
>years, the scientific results of my work finally become available, and I 
>think that you can agree with me that the unit is very productive. Why 
>cutting down a unit that worked 15 years to come to maturity and has now 
>arrived in its most productive stage? To date, 22 research units all over the 
>world asked for co-operation - and yet our academic authority cannot be 
>convinced.
>
>I would like to inform if you could help me to save my life-work. Could it be 
>possible for you to write a letter to our university (see address below) in 
>which you mention the significance of the work done in Leuven (with respect 
>to aeolian dust processes)? If this letter could be signed by different 
>collegues of yours who are involved in aeolian (or other) research, it would 
>be of significant help to me.
>
>I know, of course, that this response to your letter is quite uncommon: you 
>asked for information, and I respond by asking your help! I hope you will not 
>blame me for this. I only try to prevent our university from blowing up my 
>life-work and firing me after 15 years of hard work.
>
>I already told earlier in this letter that, if I will be able to stay in 
>Leuven, I will be very happy to share research initiatives and research 
>plans. Could you provide me with some more information about the specific 
>topics you are interested in?
>
>Thank you for your help. We do not know each other personally, but I very 
>much appreciate your letter.
