The following special session at the Fall 1995 meeting of the American 
Geophysical Union, December 11-15, San Francisco, should be of interest 
to scientists studying wind erosion. Abstract submissions are invited and 
welcomed.  For complete information, please see the July 11, 1995 issue 
of EOS, Transactions of the American Geophysical Union.

Special Session A09-  Desert Dust

Emission of dust from desert sources is a signal of nonequilibrium 
surface change.  Dust generated by wind erosion is thus one of many 
components of global change.  Desert dust may be transported thousands of 
kilometers before deposition, where it may become and important part 
of the soil.  The study of source mechanisms of desert dust emissions is 
a component of desertification science.  The study of desert dust 
includes geological studies of the origin of dust parent material, 
aerodynamic/micrometeorological studies of source mechanisms, soil 
studies of vulnerability to wind erosion, transport/synoptic scale 
meteorological studies, atmospheric electricity associated with dust 
emission, remote sensing studies, and modelling studies.  Since desert 
dust is emitted from almost all continents, it is a truly 
global/international problem.
