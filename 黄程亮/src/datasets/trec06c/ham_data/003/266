As per Ruth's request, we'd like to lay out the positions of Netscape and
Progressive Networks on the future direction of RTSP as we had discussed
last Wednesday in San Jose.  We'll start by summarizing the meeting as we
saw it, and then conclude with how we would like to proceed.

Outline:
1.  RTSP vs. RTSP'
2.  Role of the Metafile/Stream Description
3.  One control stream for many data streams?
4.  Roadmap

==================
1.  RTSP vs. RTSP'
==================

The main topic of discussion at the Wednesday RTSP meeting was to discuss
the merits of RTSP and RTSP' and see which document would be the foundation
for the next draft of RTSP.  

Generally speaking, there was a feeling that
RTSP' would serve as a better starting point, and that Netscape and PN
would assume change control of this document, and submit the next draft of
RTSP as soon as possible.  RTSP' addressed some of the issues brought up
after the submission of RTSP.  These issues were:

*  RTSP' was perceived
to be a simpler protocol.  However, it was also understood that there is a
lot of fleshing out to be done on this document.  Nonetheless, it was the
consensus that the simplicity of RTSP' was a big advantage to it.

*  RTSP'
seems more easily extensible.  The design philosophy behind RTSP was to
allow extensions via "OPTION" commands, but the level of extensibility
found in a MIME-property text-based protocol may be found in binary
protocols such as those based on ASN.1.

*  RTSP' borrows heavily from
HTTP, and therefore would be a better understood protocol for it, although
there was a note of caution that it similarity to HTTP doesn't necessarily
mean that issues such as authentication and options negotiation are solved
automatically by basing RTSP' on HTTP.  The ability to potentially
interlace HTTP and RTSP' were perceived as being good, and the ability to
reuse HTTP code was also perceived as a good thing.  The similarity to HTTP
was a feature that needs further clarifications as to the benefits and
risks.

*  The self-documenting nature of a text-based protocol was also
seen as a good thing.  However, it was not unanimous, and no one felt
comfortable in declaring text the unambiguously superior choice.  In the
interest of moving forward, though, the next draft will be a text-based
protocol.

===========================================
2.  Role of the Metafile/Stream Description
===========================================

The role of the metafile in the interaction was also discussed at great
length.  After some animated deliberation, it was decided that the
flexibility needs to exist to:

*  Allow metafile embeddability in HTML
pages, allowing a media plugin to do a priori stream selection, reducing
the user-perceived round-trips  from the point at which the user presses
"play".

*  Less clear was the desire to allow hand-authorable
metafile/session descriptions.  However, a rough consensus was reached that
a line can be drawn between information necessary for stream selection and
initialization parameters necessary for rendering streams.  It was further
decided that there was a need for the former to be handled by the metafile,
and the latter to optionally be contained as a PARAM_REPLY within RTSP
(perhaps as a binary blob in the case of .wav files or QuickTime files).

=============================================
3.  One control stream for many data streams?
=============================================

Another point of discussion was allowing multi-stream control using single
commands (i.e. one "stop" message stops all streams).  RTSP' provides an
implicit mechanism for this by defining a hierarchy using relative URLs.
For example, if a presentation consists of the following
streams:
twister/audio/14_4
twister/video/80

...then a command roughly in
the form of:
STOP twister/*

...could be issued which would stop all
streams. 

The consensus was that the implentation implications need to be
fully investigated.

==========
4. Roadmap
==========
*  Anup and Rob will work with Henning to
produce a new version of the draft.

*  Netscape and PN will do further
investigation of the performance implications of proceeding with a
text-based protocol vs. a binary-based protocol.  Barring any unforseen
difficulties or large disparities in performance, we will aim toward a
text-based protocol.
