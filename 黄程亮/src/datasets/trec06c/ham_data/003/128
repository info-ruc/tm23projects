I'm not at home, so don't have access to the machine or the manual.
If you have the manual, I can tell you which entry to use (like AMD 
Enhanced).  Let me know if you do, and I'll mail you the info.  I really 
don't have the time to draw a diagram or something :).

With the chip running at 4x40, I have the speed to fastest and fewest 
wait states (I'm pretty sure).  But this is something that you have to 
tweak in the end by yourself.  At 4x33, you should be able to set things 
to max speed.

The guy who sold me the board (Dave Gee) sent me a new bios chip (401) in 
exchange for the old bios chip (no charge).
