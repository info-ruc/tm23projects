Hi Mrs. Black:
I no longer need the HP735 machine in my office. Because the machine is 
the property of the University, I have spoken with Jim Kenyon about 
moving the machine to the Department machine room for general use by 
students and faculty in the SPH. He will make the physical move in August 
when you need me to vacate the current office space.
Please update the inventory file regarding location and use of the computer.
Thank you.
Bob
