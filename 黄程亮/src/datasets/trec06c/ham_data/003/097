We want to update some information on land damaged by wind erosion in the
United States that we use in presentations to indicate the cyclic nature of
wind erosion.  The only source I have is copied bar graph from from Soil
Conservation, vol. 42, No. 12, 1977.  The original source of the information
is not indicated.

Who keeps track of this information?  Can anyone out there send me the land
damaged by wind erosion estimates up to the present?  A table of the data or
a Lotus spreadsheet file would be ideal.  I would also appreciate any
information you may have on how this data is estmated.

Thanks.
