I am trying to use one of the Polaroid 6500 kits from Wirz with my
senior design project.  It doesn't exactly use a handyboard, but our
microcontroller is virtually identical at the lowest level.  The problem
is when we attach the device to the scope, we NEVER see any significant
voltage on the ECHO pin.  With the INIT pulsing 5V every second, we
still get nothing but residual noise (kind of a lot, but at no more
than .5V)and the remnants of the sixteen pulses from the ping.  I hear
a clicking sound too, which was unexpected and is quite annoying.  Is
this normal?  How come I never have any voltage on ECHO?  I am not
using the blanking inhibit at all, and if I look at the noise at about
a 200mv setting on the scope, I can see a shape in the noise that
changes with an objects proximity to the transducer, but it is not
anything like a logic level.  I have tried a million different ways of
hooking this thing up and have tried two different driver boards.  I
am going to buy another transducer tommorrow, but this is getting
ridiculous. How does one go about testing the device?  I am powering
it with a HP E3631A Triple output DC power supply with the current
limiter maxed at 5.0 Amps, which should be enough to cover the 2A
pinging surge.  Please help me figure out what is going on or a better
way to test it.  We connected it to the microcontroller as it connects
to the handyboard, but that of course didn't work either.  If you can
respond via email, that would be best because I don't get this list
regularly.  Please respond soon so I don't fail senior design!! ;-) 
Take it easy,

Chris
