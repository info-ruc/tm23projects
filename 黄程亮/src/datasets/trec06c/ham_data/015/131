Subject: Stepper motor help

I am planning on using stepper motors w/ a handy board and will be powering them separately from the rest of the board. What type of motor should I use? I have seen 6 and 12 volt motors availble, if anyone can recommend which to use I would appreciate it. (by the way I am planning on using two motors, if that makes a difference)
