The 100, 50, 40, etc. are not really "speeds".  They are power.  It is
related to the average voltage level of your output.  Speed depends on the
torque and characteristics of your motor.  You can hold on the the wheel
and still drive the motor at 100.  It would be 0clicks / per second in
this case. =20
