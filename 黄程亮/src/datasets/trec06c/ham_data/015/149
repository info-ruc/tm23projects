NEAR WEEKLY REPORT

April 24, 1998

MISSION OPERATIONS:

	NEAR spacecraft state is nominal.  All instruments are off.  Presently
in GS-5 attitude mode with AIU #2 in control.

	MOps and the software team uncovered a "bug" in the AIU flight software
during acceptance testing.  The underlying software error was quickly
diagnosed and corrected.  The corrected AIU software was redelivered to
Mission Operations for loading on the simulator, and another round of
acceptance testing is beginning this week.

	Supported weekly Eros planning meetings.  Presently working operations
scenarios for high orbit phases and examining various flight operations
scenarios  for attitude and momentum control, DSN real-time track spacing and
duration,  and flight recorder operations.  

	Finishing first in a series of Eros planning and scheduling tests this week
with the science teams.  No major problems detected to date, but several
improvements have been recommended.  A full debrief will be held on May 5. 

Plans:

	Upcoming Spacecraft Activities:
	
	TBD:	Load AIU S/W to AIU #1, switch back to #1 (pending successful 			 		
acceptance test)
	July: 	Flight computer software upload and flight tests of momentum
			control.
	July:	MSI software upload
	July 6:  Begin Seq_Gen (Eros scheduling software) operations with
			XGRS and MAG both on.
	August 13:  First OpNav of Eros
	August 26:  TCM 14
	September 30:  OpNav A 
	October 7:  Eros light curve movie-1

MISSION DESIGN

	NEAR Mission Design Team tasks during the past week include:

	(1) 	Mission Design personnel recomputed details of four of the first seven
Eros orbit correction maneuvers (OCM's) since detailed link margin
computations showed that communication would be marginal or impossible using
the original design for them computed last week.  Now all seven maneuvers can
be observed with NEAR's fanbeam antenna.  Maneuver files for these events were
generated and placed on the Crossroads computer for access by others.

	(2) 	Mission Design Team personnel participated in the NEAR Eros Arrival and
Early Operations Meeting on Thursday, and wrote and distributed formal minutes
for last week's meeting.
