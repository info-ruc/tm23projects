The nonlinearity has to due with the characteristics of your motor.  You
will find that a single step of power at the low end has a greater
effect on the speed than a single step at the high end, as the motor
approaches its top speed.  The relationship will change somewhat
depending on if the motor is loaded or unloaded, too.
