Subject: IR Transmit ?!? HELP
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I recently assembled a Handy Board, everything is perfect except for the
IR Transmitter.  The IR Tx LED does not light.  It is not the LED itself
because I replaced it.  I can't seem to figre out what's wrong.  Please
help.


Thank You
