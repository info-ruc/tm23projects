Thanks for this excellent article on driving
stepper motors from the Handboard.

One little yet very important question: when you
say "the common wires need to be connected to the
motor positive supply" what exact handyboard
pinout are you referring to, and with an
unmodified handyboard, what voltage would this
drive the stepper motor at?

Thanks,
/Max

PS:  Another free source of stepper motors is from
any old dot-matrix printer you plan on
discarding.  I ripped mine apart and found two
6-wire stepper motors: one driving the print head
and the other taking care of the paper feeder.
