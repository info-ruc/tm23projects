Generally the capacitor is the problem :-) The capacitor in the
original note is there to pull BINH true* to allow the sensor to
detect things that are closer than 18". Generally, when you
include it, unless the design of the system holding the
transducer is well damped, doing this will cause you to get
nothing but small values has the board detects latent vibrations
in the transducer mounting as the returning echo. Without
connecting up BINH you won't see things closer than 18" but you
will get much more reliable operation.

* I don't recall off the top of my head if that means pulling it
low early or pulling it high :-(.
