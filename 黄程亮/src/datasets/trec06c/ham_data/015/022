Subject: questions on optical encoders
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi, everyone
Hi, i am currently doing a thesis topic "Micromouse project". And, I am
going to purchase an small optical encoder to measure the speed,
acceleration and distance that my mice has taken. My mice is driven by a
DC motor, so the opti. enco.is used to measure the speed of it.
So, can u guys suggest some good models of optical encoders that fit my
DC motor.
features of optical encoders i prefer:
-- small size (<1.5 inch dia)
-- frequency response: 100kHz
-- small power supply
-- 2-channel quadrature, TTL square wave outputs
-- shaft speed >= 10,000rpm     <-- is this enough for an micromouse?

Thank you for your response on my questions.
Paul
