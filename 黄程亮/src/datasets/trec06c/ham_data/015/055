Hello,
I am curently trying to use encoders with quadratures outputs
If someone has already developped a program for such encoders I would be
very interested in.
A 8 bits counters can also be connected to this encoders. If someone has
already developped a program which could read 8 bits counters I am also
interested in.
In fact I am interested in anything that could help me to make these
encoders work.
Thanks in advance.
