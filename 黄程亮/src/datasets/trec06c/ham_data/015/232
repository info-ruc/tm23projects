Well, everything seemed ok, but now (we are in a crunch again, the
final presentation is Friday!) there is another problem.  We seem to
be getting some erroneous distances and I think I know why.  The echo
signal is pretty noisy, so my question is, how can I use a capacitor
to filter the ECHO signal without changing the readings?  Please let
me know as soon as you can, and thanks again!

Chris

PS - it is also mounted in a small box, should I damp the back side of
the transducer with something to stop reverberation?  I'll be in the
lab all day trying everything, wish me luck!
