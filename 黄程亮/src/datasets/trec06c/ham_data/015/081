Hi,

   I saw your robot at the Trinity fire fighting contest last Sunday. It =
was neat, and very animate. I was curious to know if you had figured out =
why it did what it did during your first run (?). And, what type of =
sensor were you using on the rear right of it. This was my first =
robotics contest, and it was exciting from start to finish.=20

Jose
