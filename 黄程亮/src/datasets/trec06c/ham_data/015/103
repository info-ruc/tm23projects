In fact, that's weird.. I can't answer to that. To me, I'm pretty sure that IC
would have gave me an error, like when I try to load a C program without
having
loaded the ICB containing the special function used by this C program. For
example, i can't load sony-ir.c without having loaded first sony-ir.icb.
Maybe Randy Sargent or Fred could answer that question?
