Subject: Max232CPE Substitutions
Priority: normal

I used a Max202 in place of the Max232.  I installed it with the 10uF 
caps.  

Since the 202 can be used with .1 and I already installed the 
10uF ones.  I decided to switch it for a 232.  The 202 checked out (V 
wise) like the installation instructruction testing.  

I had a bag of Max232CPE from Active that actually had DS14C232 
inside.  I installed one and everything checked out except that the 
step (3.2.2) that required measuring 9-10V at pin 3 of J9 (while
shorting pin 6 to pin 10) actually measured slightly under 5V.  

I tried a different Max232 chip and none of these other chips read 
9-10 V.  They were actually between 0 and 5 V.  

Is this still acceptable or do I really need 9-10 V?  These parts are 
supposed to be equivelant.
