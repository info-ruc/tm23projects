I'm using A-Life techniques to control a simple robot. The program I'm 
using was initially written by my A-Life professor in C++, and as I use 
IC, I need to bring it over to C. I'm having difficulties as it calls a 
class (bots) from a C++ library file (symbot.h). I need to resolve this 
problem, and I'd really appreciate any help -- I have the virtual robot 
finished, but a main part of my project was to bring the virtual robot 
out into the real world. IC compiles about half of my program -- the
class functions aren't used until the last half of the program. If IC 
can't do that, what software/hardware that is easy to get ahold of can? 
Thanks for any and all help! :)
