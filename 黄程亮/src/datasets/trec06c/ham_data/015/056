Howdy from the world of program failure...
please consider this scenario: 

1. let's say I write a series of functions, put them in a file, and
download the file to my HB.
Now I write a program that uses the previously downloaded functions, and
download it to the HB. 

2. now I decide that 3:00am is too late to continue programming, so I exit
IC, turn off my pc, turn off my HB.

3. Three hours later, I get a burning desire to do some more work on the
program, so I fire up the pc, turn on the HB, and run IC.  I don't need to
make any changes to the functions (loaded in step 1.) and they are still in
the HB's memory, so I do a little work on the program which references
them, and proceed to download it to the HB.  

Question 1:  did I just overwrite the functions I had loaded in step 1 with
the program in step 3? (t/f) 

Question 2: if question 1 is true, why didn't I get an error message saying
that the function(s) aren't defined?
