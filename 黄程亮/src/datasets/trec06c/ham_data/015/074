Are you using a pullup resistor on the ECHO pin?  If not that is your
problem.
The ECHO output is an open collector driver which requires an 4.7 K pull-up
resistor between the output and Vcc.
The pull-up is necessary for connecting the module to a digital input.

I power mine with a 7805 voltage regulator and it seems to work fine but i'm
not using it continiously.

The clicking sound is normal.

Another thing I noticed that if I ground the transducer it malfunctions.

I hope that helps ,  Let me know!
