Did you follow the instructions in the HB Assembly debug? at

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hbassem/hbassem5.html

it says:

  Output Stage
  
  If LED9R fails to light after the poke command is issued, trace the 
  following progression of signals. Please refer to the infrared output 
  schematic: 
  
  * 6811 Timer Output 2. This is the signal from the 6811 that enables
  the IR transmission circuit. Check pin 28 of the 6811; it should be
  high.  The signal is wired to pin 2 of U7; it also should be high.
  
  * Oscillator Output. Look at the signal on pin 3U7; when the 6811
  timer output 2 is high, it should be a 40 kHz square wave. If not,
  check for proper installation of U7, R4, and C6.
  
  * Inverter. The 40 kHz square wave should go to pin 1 of U9, where it
  is inverted and output on pin 2 of the same chip.
  
  * Transistor Drive. The 40 kHz signal then passes through R3, where it
  is delivered to the base of Q1. Check for the signal's presence at
  these points.
  
  * Transistor and LED Wiring. Check that the emitter lead of the
  transistor is properly grounded, and that LED9R and R5 have good
  solder joints.
  


let us know the results.
