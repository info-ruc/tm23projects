You can build a stepper motor controller on a separate circuit board, then
remove the motor control IC's off the handy board
and use the output signals to control your stepper.  Will have to write a
program to run it.  you will need a min of 4 outputs to drive
2 steppers 2) for Direction and 2) for steping.  That's if you use a stepper
controller IC.  You can power your steppers of a separate power supply.  The
handy board uses 8 output lines to control it's DC motors.

You can use a UCN5804 stepper conrtoller IC  or build your own.

I hope that helps.
