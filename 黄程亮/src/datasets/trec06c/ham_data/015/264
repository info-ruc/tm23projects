   I recently contacted Vero aboout Speedwire. The product is indeed
discontinued and they have no old stock in the UK.
However, speedwire pins are, apparently made for them by someone else.
Unfortunately they could not find out (at that time) who by.
Perhaps the original manufacturer could be found?
