Subject: Schematic Question
Priority: normal

I have been looking at the schematic for the handyboard and the 
RS232/Charger board. 

I noticed something that seems wrong.  But how could it since this 
has been out for some time?

Power goes out pin 4 of J10 on the Charger board and pin 4 on 
Handyboard J5 is grounded.  Is that right?  The UNSWPWR on the 
handyboard is connected to pin 3 of J5.

What am I missing?
