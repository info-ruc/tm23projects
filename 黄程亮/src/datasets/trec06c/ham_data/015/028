Might I suggest taking a look at US Digital's optical encoders?

They have some low cost variants that we used and were very pleased with.
I am looking at the data sheet for a "SP-16"

I am not sure what you mean when you refer to a "frequency response" with
respect to an optical encoder.

I presume that you require the encoder to draw very low current.  This
particular offering draws 27 mA max.

Check.

With the bearing option, US D. specifies that the encoder can maintain
continuous duty at 10,000 RPM.
