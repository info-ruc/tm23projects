Subject: controlling a DC motor
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hello, i am currently trying to control a DC motor's motion (direction,
speed, etc).
Besides using a motor driver chip such as L293D, what else can i do to
control the motor's motion??
Say, is there a method which can control the motor by totally software,
without a motor driver chip?

Thank you for all your replies.
