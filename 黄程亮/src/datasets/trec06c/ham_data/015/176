FROM MRS ALICE CREEK
alicecreekworld@netscape.net
Dear Good Friend.

I greet you in the name of the Lord.

I am Mrs.Alice Creek from Solomon  Islands. I am married to Late Mr.John W. Creek who worked with  MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANY EXXON AS A DRILLING RIG SUPPLIER in KUWAIT  for nine years before he died on the 15th August 2005. 

We were married  for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief illness that  lasted for only four days.

Ever before his death we were both born  again Christians and have sown into many ministries. Since his death I  decided not to remarry, but feeling quite lonely if not the Lord who  has been my partner and comforter.

When my late husband was alive he  Deposited the sum of Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States  Dollars ($8,500,000.00) with a Finance/Security Firm In Europe and  this fund is presently with the finance firm awaiting my disbursement  as beneficiary and next of kin to the funds.

Recently, my Doctor told  me that I would not last for the next Eight months due to cancer  problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a  church,organization or good person that will utilize this money the way  I am going to instruct herein.

I want a church,organization or good  person that will use this funds to help the orphans, widows and other  people that need financial assistance.

Using part of this money to  provide facilities for God,s work, taking the gospel to greater height  is my major reason of donating this funds out.

The Bible made us to  understand that"Blessed is the hand that giveth".

l took this decision  because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my  husband relatives are not Christians and it had been their wish to see  my husband dead in order that they might inherit his wealth since we  have no son. These people are therefore not worthy of this inheritance  as they have squandered much of my husbands har earned money already.

This is why I am taking this decision. Meanwhile I am not afraid of 
death hence I know where I am going. It is only a sinner who's death is 
painful. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard 
because of my health and also the presence of my husband's relatives 
around me always.

I don't want them to know about this development and  l know that With God
all things are possible.

As soon as I receive  your reply I shall give you the contact of the Finance/Security Firm in  Europe . I will also issue a letter of authorization to the firm that  will prove you the present beneficiary of this money. I also want you  to always uplift me in prayer.

My happiness is that I lived a life of  a worthy Christian. Whoever that Wants to serve the Lord must serve him  in truth and faith, "serving him with all you have, knowing that naked  we come and naked we must go"

Contact me on my very confidential  email address below and any delay in your reply will give me room in  sourcing another good person, church,organization for this same  purpose.

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated  herein as i have prayed and fasted on this already.


Hoping to receive  your response immediately.

Thanks and Remain blessed in the Lord.

Sister Alice Creek

One With Love And Best Wishes!!!
