Hi,

Wouldn't it be possible to wire them both to the same input port and turn
on the one that you want information from and turn the other off?  For
example, the polaroid sonar data states that you can control turning on
and off the device, so you turn that one on for the majority of the time
but turn it off momentarilly and turn on the V2x to get information and
then turn it back off and turn on the sonar again.  OR,  can it be done in
a hardware fashion (which probably would be better)?

Thanks in advance,

Scott
