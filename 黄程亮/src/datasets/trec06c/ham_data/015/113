Hi all, first, the URL:

  http://www.media.mit.edu/~fredm/projects/tc98/

I went to last weekend's Fire-Fighting Robot Contest at Trinity
College, along with my colleague Steve Ocko, who had built a cute
robot based on our network-cricket technology (see
<http://www.media.mit.edu/~fredm/projects/cricket/techtalk/buscrick.html>
for more on that).

We spent about a day programming, and had a pretty good
wall-following-at-a-distance behavior going using sharp gp2d02 optical
distance sensors.

the best part of our design was how it would put out the candle:  a
LEGO hook and ladder would extend, which would invert a canister of
vinegar into a pellet of baking soda, which caused a strong stream of
foam and CO2 to gush out of the fire hose!

unfortunately, just before our run, i let the robot accidentally
trigger itself, and it spilled vinegar all over itself, and several of
the sensor shorted out.  when i put the robot down to compete, i
didn't realize it but one of the distance sensors wasn't working, so
it just drove around in a circle.  it was quite disappointing.  argh.

anyway, it was great seeing everyone at the contest.  enjoy the
pictures.
