If you only use one motor controller IC you  can use the 16 pin socket of
the second motor control to get 4 more outputs.

Then you can connect the INIT and BINH to these and have Port D control your
V2x compass.
All you have to do is modify your sonar.c program to use these new pins.

I hope that helps.
P.S. If you need more info let me know.
