Subject: Handy board help

I am interested in using the Handy Board, but I have a few questions about it first. Please help.  :)

 I noticed the Handy Board supports 4 motors but I am interested in using stepper motors with it. Is this possible? 

 If so what modifications would be nessary to accomodate for the extra connections needed for the stepper motors. Also what would I have to do as far as having to deal with the extra current from the stepper motors as apposed to regular DC motors.

 Any help you can give me will be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you,
 
Brian Carvalho
