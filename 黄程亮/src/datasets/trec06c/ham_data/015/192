Think-Thin Solutions Update:

We did a review on April 6th telling people that Think-Thin Solutions would not be able to release their 10 day weight formula until July 19th.

Well that was then and this is now!  Think-Thin Solutions product has been pushed through all the tests and is ready for release in stores on May 29th.  If you can't wait, then they are accepting early orders from the website below.
