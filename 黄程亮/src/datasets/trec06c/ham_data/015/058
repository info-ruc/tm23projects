Hi.  I teach 8th grade science and I am very interested in adding Robotics
to our curriculum in the fall.  I have been following with keen interest,
the listserv on the handyboard.  Could somebody tell me, where I can obtain
reading materials to help me get started in robotics?  I am sure that this
question falls short of the things I have been reading, but I am very
interested in learning more, so I can add this to my Advanced Science
class.
Thanks for your help.
