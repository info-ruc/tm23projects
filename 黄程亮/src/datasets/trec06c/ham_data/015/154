Subject: Smooth PWM routines for IC 3.1/3.2


Thanks to Julian Skidmore and Scott Seaton, we have a version of pcode and
libraries for IC 3.1/3.2 which implement Julian's "smooth pwm" routines for
the MIT Handyboard.

To grab these, please go to the following address:

ftp://newtonlabs.com/contrib/smooth-pwm

I've included the "README" file from the directory at the end of this
message to inform those who don't already know how Julian's modification
might help you.

Many thanks to Julian and Scott for contributing this feature.

README for IC 3.1 Smooth PWM routines for the MIT Handyboard
4/24/98

The files in this directory are contributed by 

            Julian Skidmore <skidmorj@cs.man.ac.uk>

and

            Scott Seaton <Scott.Seaton@Aus.Sun.COM>

The "Smooth PWM" routines, designed by Julian Skidmore, allow for
finer control of the amount of power going to the 4 motor outputs on
the MIT Handyboard.  

While the "motor" library function appears to allow 100 forward power
levels and 100 backwards power levels, in fact, the -100 to 100 is
quantized to 8 forward and 8 backwards power levels in the standard
library and pcode.

Julian's modifications to the pcode and library allow for full -100 to 100
resolution for setting power.  This can be particularly useful when running
low-voltage motors on the Handyboard, where power levels need to be kept
low.

--------------------------

TO INSTALL:

Simply copy pcode_hb.s19 and lib_hb.c into your IC libraries
directory.  You might want to back up the old versions of the same
files first.

Next, be sure to download the updated pcode file.  You should see
"SMOOTHPWM" on the LCD screen on bootup.

Note that if the new library is used with the old pcode, or
vice-versa, the "motor" command will not behave at all linearly with
respect to the power command (although 0 and 100 will still work as
normal).

If you have problems downloading pcode_hb.s19 and lib_hb.c, you can
instead download and unzip "smooth.zip", which contains the same files.
