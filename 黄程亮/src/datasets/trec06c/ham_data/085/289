Thanks for the help...

For those that aren't aware, the correct (i.e. way that works) way to
specify non-local data files is using a forward slash '/', not a backslash
'\' (as is standard on windows systems.  Escaping the backslash with another
backslash (C string literal style) does not work either.

e.g. to specify
"C:\big data\file.avi"

use
"C:/big data/file.avi"

If the above is not totally correct, please forgive me as I found this by
experimenting with different delimiter characters.

Thanks,
Rua Haszard Morris.
