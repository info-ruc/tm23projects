I recently purchased a Compaq Evo N1015v and it turns out that
the 2.4 flavor of linux kernels are mystified by it's ALi
derived north bridge chips.  This means that Redhat 7.x/8.x will
not install, nor should any linux distro based on the 2.4.x kernel.
(is debian woody 2.4 these days?)

I did accomplish getting a 2.5.48 kernel to fully boot and recognize
everything cleanly, but, I'm stuck on trying to make a bootable
install cd with that kernel.

There's a great howto for making a modified redhat boot
cd with different rpm's and what not, but the howto does not
cover modifying the kernel (also, see isolinux dir under the
redhat install cd's).

So, anyone done this before?  I have feelers out for it on
several news groups and I'm waiting for a response from
someone at redhat, but if anyone local has done this or knows
where to find out more quickly, please e-mail me.
