Men and Feminism

	Throughout history women have been oppressed by men=2E  The oppression =

is a social problem that affects all women=2C NOT just individuals=2E  In=
 =

the traditional patriarchal society women were forced to be dependent =

on men=2E  When feminist movements first started=2C a man who allowed a =

women to work was rare=2E  Women have come a long way in their struggle =

for social change=2E  They now have the right to vote along with job =

opportunities that used to be unheard of=2E  With all that they have =

gained women still feel oppressed by men=2E  This is primarily in =

salaries=2E  Women have spread the idea of feminism and some men today =

are actually labeling themselves as feminists=2E  This at first is =

unbelievable=2E  What=3F  A person-let alone-a man looking beyond his own=

self interest=3F  Am I in the twilight zone=3F  This seems like such a =

breakthrough=2E  Maybe there is hope after all=2E  Feminists overall seem=
 =

to be critical of the motivations of men claiming to resist socially =

constructed categories and labeling themselves as feminist=2E  =


	Society puts pressures on males and females to fit into socially =

constructed stereotypes=2E  These stereotypes vary with different =

cultures=2E  Typically=2C society wants men to be strong=2C domineering=2C=
 and =

emotionless while women are supposed to be emotional=2C weak=2C passive=2C=
 =

and thin=2C almost to the point of starvation=2E  It=92s really very sick=
=2E  =

Modernization has left females striving for independence often single =

and raising a kid playing dual roles=2E  They often go from a motherly =

figure at home to a strong almost possessing masculine qualities =

character in the workplace where they find they need to depend more on =

reason and be less emotional (another transition from traditional to =

modern)=2E  The capability of a woman to adapt easily if need be is =

amazing=2E  This all goes along with the theory of modernization in that =

women and men are becoming more similar as women adapt to enter the =

workplace=2E =

	A male feminist=2C Andrew Ross=2C explains the role of culturally =

constructed stereotypes in the case of Peter Sutcliffe=2C the Yorkshire =

Ripper=2E  Between 1975 and 1981 this man was found to be the killer and =

mutilator of at least thirteen women and the attacker of at least seven =

others=2E  Most of these women were prostitutes=2E  This manhunt is one o=

actions and moral liability were the subject of one of the most =

revealing court trials in contemporary British social history=2E  =

Sutcliffe was given a trial after a judge at the initial hearings was =

dissatisfied that Sutcliffe=92s initial statements to police=2C and those=

made later in the course of psychiatric investigation conflicted=2E  At =

the time of his arrest=2C Sutcliffe stated that he =93had the urge to kil=

as a divine mission from god to kill all prostitutes=2E  According to the=

defense=2C Sutcliffe=92s intent was to kill only prostitutes=2E  he wante=

clean the streets of society=2E  This trail had to redefine prostitutes =

and non-prostitutes=2C two groups that Sutcliffe intended to distinguish =

between but in deed and practice confused=2E  In the end=2C Sutcliffe was=

punished for confusing theory with practice=2E  In Sutcliffe=92s first =

encounter with a prostitute he was mocked for his impotency=2E  This made=

prove his masculinity=2E  This case shows how dangerous socially =

	=

	Given the typical stereotypes=2C men are expected to resist feminism=2C =

and feminists are often assumed to be man haters=2E  There must be some =

influence that drives men from the typical societal construction of =

masculinity to becoming feminists=2E  Certain forces seem to drive men to=
 =

look outside of their own personal interest=2E  Usually this starts with =

the presence of a kind female role model=2E  For Tom Digby=2C this force =

was his mother=2E  =93My mother is one of the most caring and empathetic =

persons I have ever known=2E=94  His father felt it the mother=92s =

responsibility to raise him=2E  As a result=2C Tom=92s mother had a profo=

manhood as rather silly=2E=94  This caring mother coupled with a father =

that wasn=92t bent on having a manly son began the molding of a feminist =

son=2E  =


	In junior high school=2C Tom served as a campaign manager to help a girl=
 =

running for student body president=2C a position that had always been =

filled by a male=2E  He gladly gave a speech for her at an assembly=2C =

which later won her the presidency=2E  Through all of this he was really =

bothered by the unfairness of the gender discrimination he found his =

candidate faced=2E  After this=2C Tom became more popular and was elected=
 =

for several student leadership positions=2E  From this he learned two =

important lessons=2C =93(1)  that there were means other than team sports=
 =

to bolster my masculine status=2C and (2) that gender loyalty was not =

crucial to being a successful heterosexual=2E=94   This incident did not =

make Tom a feminist=2E  It just opened the doors to his awareness of the =

oppression women are faced with=2E  As one can imagine men doing feminism=
 =

have sparked various reactions from female feminists
	=

	Some female feminists support men doing feminism=2E  These women =

feminists think it=92s wonderful that men are supporting women and =

stepping beyond the constraints of masculinity=2E  One such feminist is =

Sandra Harding=2E  She believes that men are capable of thinking and =

coming up with new feminist ideas=2E  She wants to encourage men to study=
 =

feminism thinking that it is important for the movement to have the =

interest=2C to eventually end up at the ultimate goal=2C equality=2E =


	Others are more critical of men doing feminism=2E  They are frightened =

at the thought=2E  One opposing reaction from a female feminist is that =

of Alice Jardine=2E  =93Men in feminism sent me scurrying for cover=2E=94=
  She =

classifies male feminists into three groups=2E  The first group she =

refers to as the Silent Majority=2E  This group consists of men who   =

don=92t read or take into account the work produced by feminists over the=
 =

past twenty years=2E  The second group of men is composed of visitors=2C =

those who come in and out of feminism without changing anything in the =

overall itinerary of their theory or practice=2E  The third and final =

group of men are those that are actually trying to learn and change=2E  =

Alice seems to have serious doubts of the hidden motivations that men =

may have for studying feminism=2E  She thinks that if men really want to =

be feminists they should actually apply feminism to their everyday =

life=2E  =93You yourselves could stop being reactive to feminism and star=

is the argument of the opposition! =


	Another female feminist in opposition to men doing feminism is Rosi =

Braidotti=2E  In her essay Envy=3A or With Your Brains and My Looks=2C sh=
e =

thinks men aren=27t and shouldn=92t be in feminism=2E  It=92s apparent th=
at she =

is very much threatened by the sex=2E  She pulls a quote from The SCUM =

Manifesto by Valerie Solanis that says =93The male is a biological =

combined with his inability to relate and to feel compassion=2C has made =

of the world a shitpile=2E=94  For some reason I think she would be =

classified as a radical feminist=2E  Rosi doesn=92t want egotistical male=
s =

destroying feminism by becoming feminists when they lack the =

experience=2E  Men were never oppressed=2E  How can they know what it is =

like to be female=3F  Why should they be able to breeze through feminist =

books and all the theories thereby declaring themselves feminists when =

they haven=27t had to go through any of the struggles=2E  It worries her =

that men are coming into feminism when they don=92t have the emotional =

attachment to it that women experience=2E  =


	In her opposition=2C she also refers to contextual constraints the =

movement is facing in France=2E  She says =93the sociopolitical impact of=
 =

French feminism has not been strong enough for feminist theory=2C women=92=
s =

studies=2C or women scholars to make anything like they impact they have =

undermine the (seemingly rather fast to settle) laws of the discourse=2E=94=

(Men In Feminism Pg=2E157)  Surprisingly=2C there are also some men who =

agree with women that say men have nothing unique to offer feminism=2E  =

Cary Nelson is one male feminist that holds this viewpoint=2E  =93Men can=

make useful contributions=2C but feminism does not need either discursive=
 =

interventions or generous admiration from the vantage point of a =

culturally constructed masculinity=2E=94   He thinks such interventions =

would be destructive=2E

	One of the main issues that was addressed repeatedly was that of =93Can =

men really practice feminism=3F=94  After all=2C the two words=2C =93men=94=

 it =

right to bar them from feminist theory because some feminists feel =

threatened=3F   Is it impossible for a men to be a feminist because of =

This can only be done if feminists start setting the example and =
