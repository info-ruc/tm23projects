     The topic that I chose for this essay is the Ku Klux Klan. I fin=
d this group really appalling and I can not imagine anyone hating ano=
ther race so much. The Ku Klux Klan is no better than the Nazis in Ge=
rmany and in fact they seem to parallel each other a lot from the sta=
rt to the fall and then to the slow rise. The reason that I chose thi=
s topic was because it is something that has always fascinated me and=
 that I have heard a lot about. The other reason I chose this topic w=
as because about a month ago on the discovery channel it talked about=
 the Knights, a new group that strongly believes in a White Christian=
 America. In this essay I am going to look at the Ku Klux Klan from a=
 sociological point of view. My main focus will be how this group dis=
proves the theory of modernity.

     The Ku Klux Klan was formed in Pulaski, Tennessee around 1865. N=
athan Bedford Forrest, was a confederate general and also the first l=
eader of the Ku Klux Klan. The Ku Klux Klan rebelled against the righ=
ts given to the blacks after the civil war they believed that the Whi=
tes were superior and the Blacks were and should remain inferior. Wit=
h their belief in White supremacy they would ride around in white rob=
es and white hoods and would terrorize Blacks and White sympathizers.=
 Sometimes they would go as far as killing and raping the Blacks. The=
 Ku Klux Klan became a very powerful movement and there were many mem=
bers all over the south until Congress passed a bill that authorized =
federal troops to take action against Klan members. The Klan membersh=
ip started to dissipate at this point.

     In the early 1900s the Klan was revived but now the hate grew it=
 was not only against blacks but anyone that was not a White Christia=
n American. The Klan still used violence but now it also incorporated=
 politics. The Klan started to elect political officials that had the=
 same views as them and their membership grew to about two million pe=
ople. The Klan dissipated over time and would revive itself again and=
 then dissipate.=20

     Today's Klan is looking for a more respectable image in fact som=
e groups have allowed women into them. The Klan has also created yout=
h groups to inform the young people of America why we should hate any=
one that is not a white Christian. The membership of the Klan today i=
s about ten thousand people. They have also added something to their =
name; they call themselves the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Some extr=
emists of the group still use violence but the majority of their grou=
p spreads their message through words, pamphlets, hate music, etc. Th=
e objectives of the Klan today is to "return prayer to school, stop a=
ll non-white immigration, drug testing for all welfare recipients, qu=
arantine all aids carriers, declare all laws attempting to enforce gu=
n control as unconstitutional."=20

     The history that I found on the Ku Klux Klan is from www.altered=
.com/dengue/kkk/history.htm. Having read the history of the Ku Klux K=
lan it really makes me upset to wonder where all this hatred came fro=
m. I am also curious to know what makes Whites better than Non-Whites=
. You cannot say it is because we were here in America first because =
it was really the Native Americans (Indians) who are indigenous to th=
is land. I am also curious to understand why this hatred has come abo=
ut.

     The theory of modernity is a movement from traditional to a mode=
rn society. In a traditional society we were all group oriented. The =
family was very important and we lived life very much according to ou=
r culture. A traditional society would be considered a place with sma=
ll villages that were all tight nit. A modern society would be consid=
ered a very big city where you do not really care about anyone else b=
ut yourself. A modern society is very individualistic, democratic, an=
d capitalistic. The theory of modernity suggests that we would some d=
ay live in a world where conflict has disappeared because everyone wo=
uld become the same.

     The Ku Klux Klan definitely goes against the theory of modernity=
 because the conflict has not gone away in fact it has grown. The Kla=
n used to only hate Blacks but now it hates anyone who is not a White=
 Christian. It is true that the membership is not as great as it used=
 to be but members are all over the place. Also, because of stricter =
laws it is not as easy to get away with the violence but they can cre=
ate powerful words and music to spread their message. One thing that =
the modern society has created for the Klan is the use of technology.=
 The website www.kukluxklan.org.kids4.htm is a site that gives kids a=
 distorted version of how the Ku Klux Klan started. It also spreads t=
heir message of hate. It is really neat because it is an interactive =
website and it can really draw your attention. Technology has become =
a very powerful weapon to the Klan because they can now spread their =
message of hate all over the world. Before the Klan would have to hol=
d secret meetings and now everything can be done on the=20

     My response to the theory of modernity is that a modern society =
creates conflict. A modern society makes it easier to hate, to start =
wars and to communicate any message of hate or violence. The use of t=
he internet allows the Klan to communicate with the rest of the world=
 and enables them to share their beliefs. Civil liberties allow them =
to line the streets. Granted that a modern society cuts back on the v=
iolence there is still this conflict that exists. There is one aspect=
 of the Klan that does go with the theory of modernity and that is th=
e fact that the membership is very weak. Perhaps the Klan will eventu=
ally dissipate because the membership will fade out. I do think howev=
er, that Klan members are afraid of this and that is why there are we=
bsites that promote kids to get involved in this movement. If Klan me=
mbers can get the youth of America to follow them then perhaps the ki=
ds would only marry within their race and therefore create only pure =
White Christians.

     I would like to address the issue of why the hate exists. One wa=
y of looking at the Ku Klux Klan's hatred is from the sociological as=
pect of race. Race is an ascriptive characteristic, it is predetermin=
ed and it can not be changed. People have always categorized and sepa=
rated themselves by Race.=20

     The Ku Klux Klan separated themselves into whites and non-whites=
. There hatred sprung from the fact that Blacks were given the right =
to vote after the civil war had ended and the reconstruction beginnin=
g. For a long time the Blacks were slaves and I believe that people g=
ot used to the idea that Whites were better and were superior because=
 the Blacks worked for them. The Blacks had no rights, no say and wer=
e just there to do their job. After the civil war, I believe that som=
e Whites thought of the Blacks still as slaves. There was also this r=
esentment that was created because the South had lost. I believe that=
 the men who started the Klan were very upset at the lost and decided=
 to take it out on the Blacks because they could not take out their a=
nger on the North. The Blacks were in some ways used as punching bags=
 so that the Whites could release their anger on someone. As time goe=
s on throughout history foreigners are starting to come into the coun=
try and take over. They are creating competition in the=20

     In an article called The kkk and the federal government (www.kuk=
luxklan.org/kkk.htm) it talks about just that. This article says that=
 after the civil war the Klan was upset with the federal troops that =
occupied the South. As time goes on the Klan became upset with the go=
vernment because it allowed foreigners to come in. This article also =
talks about how our government has become corrupted because it is not=
 the government that was created by our founding fathers. It is a gov=
ernment that has been infiltrated by people who are not White Christi=
ans.=20


     My response to this article is that the Klan is taking out its a=
nger against non-Whites because it is a way of getting a message to t=
he government because they cannot attack the government itself. I do =
believe however, that it does not give them the right to hurt anyone =
with words or violence because they are angry at a bigger force that =
they can not touch.

     One other sociological aspect that I would like to look at in re=
gards to the Ku Klux Klan is why are these people coming together. On=
e way of looking at it is collective action. These people are joining=
 together for a common goal and a common interest. The Klan believes =
in a purely White Christian America. They believe that anyone who is =
not White is inferior to them. The Klan gives people a reason to form=
, it unites people with common interest and it creates a hate that ca=
n be shared by many.

     I looked at a website called American Knights (www.americanknigh=
ts.com) and it started off by saying Black may be beautiful, Tan may =
be grand but White is still the color of the big boss man. This web s=
ite talks about the beliefs of the Knight of the Ku Klux Klan. It als=
o has a membership form so anyone who is a White Christian may join. =
It talks about what the group does and how they feel.

     My response to this website is that it really gives people a sen=
se of belonging. It is almost scary to think because this website off=
ers you a family. It unites people together with a common interest an=
d by bringing these people together it creates a larger force. Thanks=
 to technology it can link people together from all over the world. H=
opefully they do not become such a powerful group that eventually one=
 day they will have their way and there will only be White Christians=
 in America.

     Another way of looking at the Ku Klux Klan is that they are usin=
g race and collective action to stop the movement of modernity.  They=
 are saying that there should be one pure race which is White Christi=
ans.  This is almost impossible due to the fact that there have been =
so many intermarriages and it would be hard to get rid of all foreign=
ers in the United States.  They use collective action to unite people=
 with the same interest but it can not involve everyone because there=
 is a huge determining factor and that is that you have to be white. =
 They theory of modernity says that everyone will have the same inter=
est but if you use race to determine the same interest then you are r=
estricting the usage of who shares the common interest.

     Another interesting thing that I came across when studying the K=
u Klux Klan is that these people needed something to hate.  I believe=
 that throughout history people are always looking for someone to bla=
me for their misfortunes and the Ku Klux Klan found anyone Non-White =
to blame.

     The Ku Klux Klan goes against the theory of modernity in many wa=
ys which I have pointed out.  In fact it makes you wonder which socie=
ty seems better a traditional society or a modern one.  A traditional=
 society encourages the group, groups such as the KKK.  A modern soci=
ety however is filled with people who only care about themselves.  Th=
e Ku Klux Klan makes you wonder if it is better to have people united=
 together or is it better to have people who are only for themselves.
