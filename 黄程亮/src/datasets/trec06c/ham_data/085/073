Greetings,

This is excellent!

The reason the cp rather than bpcp matters is that bpcp is unaware of nfs
mounts, so the data was going from fileserver to master via NFS, then from
master to slave via bpcp, so doubling the network traffic required.

NFS can behave badly on a busy network. The sleep was also intended to
reduce the number of simultaneous transfers, and appears to have helped a
great deal.

I hope you have a wonderful Thanksgiving.

G'day,
sjames
