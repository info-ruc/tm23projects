Hi Luminita,

Over a year ago Francisco set up psc1 as a mysql server and installed
caldb. I'm sure it hasn't been updated since Francisco left. There's
an environment variable that points to the cladb server and the default
is the one at JLab (see Mark Ito's caldb document). We were able to
run recsis using either the caldb at JLab or the local one. I don't know the

details about maintaining the mysql database. We need to check with
Francisco about that. I don't think we'll be cooking any real data, but
I guess we may need caldb to cook simulated data. So perhaps we should
consider updating the local database or make sure we can still 'see' the
JLab database.

I hope this helps.

Mike

Jerry,

Before installing anything on pscm1, I need some information.

Mike mentioned that Francisco has setup some time while ago a mysql server
on psc1.

Do you want to keep the same setup - mysql server on psc1 and have mysql
client only on pscm1?
Or both the server and the client to be installed on the new cluster?

Thanks,
Sasko

Sasko,

I think we need MySQL on pscm1 installed if not too difficult.
CLAS software uses sets of detector&time related values
organized in a MySQL database with a master version at 
JLAB and a mirror at UR.

I expect to pick up the software build next Monday - it
would be great if it is installed at that time.
If the effort is too big I can just copy the relevant 
libraries from JLAB.

Please also let me know where you put the CERN libraries (path&version).
Are you going to move old-home to new directories or should
 I do it - as root of course? The directories with different 
releases of CLAS software is named... clas
Thank you,

We want both the client and the server installed on the new cluster.
The client allows us to use the JLAB database. However this might be slow
due to network traffic or JLAB database even broke down couple of times
unable to handle the numerous requests. Then it's better to have a mirror
at UR and for that we need the client. Once MySQL is installed and Mark
Ito established the new mirroing scheme (he is working on changes right
now) I will create a new database mirror in UR cluster.

hi steven,

   thanks for the help. i just got back from an all-day family outing
(UVa beat Maryland 48-13 and both kids slept through most of it) and
i'll try to start working on this tomorrow. i will probably just 
download root from the CERN site and re-install.

Greetings,

Actually running root has been most informative. There appears to be a
problem with the installation of root PRO. Looking at the dmesg output of
node 3, root.exe is getting a segv when it tries to run. ldd shows that
it's library requirements are unsatisfied (on the master as well!).

When I add /usr/root/PRO/lib to /etc/ld/so.conf and run ldconfig, it tells
me that several libraries in that directory are truncated. The real
surprise is that it could run on node 0 at all. Possably the libs somehow
got cached there and were later damaged.

The best way to proceed would be to restore /usr/root/PRO/lib from backup
or re-install the package, then bpsh -d allup /sbin/ldconfig -v >setuplog

setuplog should show no problems then. 

I have set up the ld.so.conf on all nodes but 8 in advance to be ready for
this operation.

G'day,
sjames
