Greetings,

Just for variety, I'll answer the questions from easy to hard order :-)

/var/spool/mqueue filling:
var/spool/mqueue is where outgoing mail goes for sendmail to process (even if
it's going from and to a local user). 

Currently, sendmail isn't running on pscm1, so the mail piles up in mqueue
rather than being delivered to user mailbox files in /var/spool/mail.

/var/spool/at is where the batch system holds job output until completion. Upon
completion, it will mail the output to the job's owner.

Probably, sendmail should be running on the master.

To avoid overfilling /var, /var/spool can either be symlinked to a larger volume
(/usr or to one of the RAID volumes) or have your batch scripts redirect the
output to a scratch file and then move (or bpcp) it to the user's home directory
when the run is complete.

I am currently tracking down a bug in the batch queue that pushes jobs off to
the b queue and leaves them there when they can't be immediatly dispatched. I
believe there is a workaround for that, I'll dig that up and send it to you. The
ultimate solution will be an update to the at rpm.

Changing the loadaverage threshold won't do anything here. The bproc mods to the
batch queue system use a 'slot allocation' rather than loadavg. The slot
allocator assumes that the best allocation is 1 job per CPU on a compute node.

That is done for three reasons. First, that's generally a better allocation for
any scientific computation while loadavg is better suited for general purpose
servers. Second, loadavg is more expensive to compute in that it will generate
extra net traffic and disrupt the cache and take extra locks on the compute
nodes (which will hurt performance). Compute jobs often have bursts of I/O where
the job will sleep waiting, followed by long periods of pure computation. That
can cause a brief dip in apparent loadavg and lead to bad allocations.

G'day,
sjames
