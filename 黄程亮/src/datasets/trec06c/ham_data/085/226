There seems to be some spare capacity in the panel.  I think we can support
25 amps or so on each of three phases (120 volt).  

Hope this helps.

Vikash

Lets meet in front of the Science building at 4:00pm on friday. We can
work for a couple of hours and I'll give you an overview of linux and the
clusters.

We can then knock out stuff left on the agenda on saturday. I plan to be
in all day.

See you soon.
