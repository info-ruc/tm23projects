I just remember one more detail: when compiling a1c I
had PROCESS_TAGM undefined. I think not all software
components (headers, sources) now in CVS are of the kind
of accepting this multiple hits tagger processing. If you
are interested in this I can talk to Dennis Weygand and
get over coherent a1 sources able to incorporate this new 
feature. Just let me know - I don't think it is critical.

Dear Jerry & Mike,

At last I succeded to put together release-4-4 of CLAS software
of pscm1 /home/clas/builds. I changed the PRODUCTION link to point to 
release-4-4. In the end the only executable that I copied over - since I
couldn't find how to make it link here) was gsim_int.

I also installed a mirror of the calibration database on pscm1.

Please let me know if you have any problem using these. Thank you for 
your patience,
