The Sociology Used in Defining the Problems and Outcomes Within the 1=
992 Los=20
Angeles Riots

There have been many different types of riots that have ensued during=
 the=20
history of not only the United States, but the world.=A0 Many riots h=
ave=20
caused many things such as war.=A0 For instance, many of the great hi=
storical=20
riots such as the Boston Tea Party, The Boston Massacre, and what end=
ed up=20
being the French Revolution.=A0 More recently there have been two sep=
arate=20
riots in the county of Los Angeles, the riots in Watts that happened =
in the=20
1960=92s, and the riots in South Central Los Angeles which happened i=
n 1992.=A0=20
Yet the Los Angeles riot was different from the rest.=A0 There were m=
any=20
demographical problems that caused this out roar of pain and frustrat=
ion=20
=66rom the multicultural, and multi- ethnic community of South Centra=
l Los=20
Angeles in from the late 1980=92s and the early 1990=92s.=A0 Those pr=
oblems ended=20
in being what is called as the worst riots of the 20th Century.=A0 Th=
e=20
problems of the riots are still being discussed today by many sociolo=
gists,=20
mainly in the areas of race and ethnicity, and social movements and=
=20
collective action.
As a background to the Los Angeles riots here are the sequence of eve=
nts,=20
given by the media, as to how the riots ensued:
=93On April 29th, 1992, the city of Los Angeles - a city in which ten=
sions and=20
anger had been growing for a long time, but toward what no one quite =
knew --=20
heard a jury of six men and six women deliver not guilty verdicts for=
 the=20
Los Angeles Police Department officers accused of beating Rodney King=
. And=20
the city found that this was the crescendo, the climax, and Los Angel=
es=20
exploded with riot, arson and looting, accompanied by more than 50 de=
aths=20
and the injuries of more than 2,000. The final costs of the physical=
=20
devastation and the emotional residue cannot be totaled, but the mora=
le and=20
the social fiber of Los Angeles had been forever altered.=94=A0 Also,=
 from a=20
field reporter form the station KTLA that was live during the riots s=
aid,=A0=20
=93I kept remembering the stories we did in Watts after the 1965 riot=
s. I=20
vividly recall the twisted, shattered buildings that had burned to th=
e=20
ground. One by one, clean up crews had come in, leveled the structure=
s,=20
hauled away the debris, leaving nothing but vacant, weed-filled lots.=
 Those=20
lots had remained vacant for years after the tragedy of Watts, a woun=
ded=20
community with no places of business, just block after block of vacan=
t lots.=20
It was so sad, I felt so sad. Here, tonight, each one of these fires =
was=20
burning up, not only the buildings, but the jobs and futures of so ma=
ny=20
people who live in the community. Now, there would be no jobs, no pla=
ces to=20
buy anything, no hope, no future. All because of these fires of April=
,=20
1992.=94
Now many people think that the riots were all because of the anger of=
 the=20
black community of South Central over the outrageous ruling in the Ro=
dney=20
King trial.=A0 However, through many of the articles written the Rodn=
ey King=20
verdict was merely the straw that broke the camels back for the viole=
nce=20
that came after. The other aspects that caused the riot were the many=
 other=20
social, economic, cultural, and demographic factors.
Riots, as described in sociology, are one of the many types of Social=
=20
Movements and Collective Action that we have discussed in lecture.=
=A0=20
Collective Action is defined from the lecture as being any kind of jo=
int=20
effort put forth by any group of individuals.=A0 This was definitely =
the case=20
of the Los Angeles riots because all of the rioters were different ty=
pes of=20
people, yet all came together.=A0 Along with begin a collective actio=
n by a=20
group of people, this was also a Social Movement.=A0 Social movements=
 are=20
sustained social movements such as the civil rights movements, or the=
=20
hawaiian sovereignty movements which was learned through the lecture =
of=20
social movements.=A0=A0=A0 The riots are different from those however=
.=A0 The riots=20
are not sustained over long periods of time.=A0 The time span was sho=
rter,=20
mainly a few days before it all stopped.=A0 The Hawaiian Sovereignty,=
 for=20
example has been going on for a long time now.=A0 In Collective Actio=
n there=20
are a few ways that are used to define the different types of groups =
that=20
arise in situations.=A0 Two of those terms are a crowd, and a mob.=
=A0 Both of=20
these terms are used freely in normal society but have a little bit o=
f a=20
different definition in a sociological stand point.=A0=A0 A crowd, fo=
r instance,=20
is only a group that does not have a common goal.=A0=A0 A mob, on the=
 other=20
hand, is a group that is engaging in violence that does not have a co=
mmon=20
goal.=A0=A0 The term that would best describe the people who particip=
ated in the=20
Los Angeles Riots in 1992 would be a mob.=A0=A0 Everyone that was out=
 on the=20
streets was running a muck.=A0=A0 Burning buildings, shooting at poli=
ce and=20
firefighters, stealing form stores, and beating random people on the=
=20
streets.=A0 Most of the people were only out in the streets looking a=
fter=20
themselves and stealing things from the stores that would only benefi=
t=20
them.=A0 However, some of the mob did work together.=A0 There were so=
me people=20
who came to South Central that would pile into a van, go into a store=
 and=20
steal items that would be beneficial to not only themselves but to th=
e=20
community.
One main type of social action that was talked about in most of the b=
ooks,=20
and articles was Collective Behavior.=A0 Collective Behavior involves=
 large=20
numbers of people engaging in non routine activities that violate soc=
ial=20
expectations.=A0 This is the most common description of the Los Angel=
es Riots,=20
or any riot for that matter.=A0=A0 The main reason is that the group =
of people=20
that are engaging in the activities are doing something that is not o=
f the=20
norm.=A0 These are actions that is not normative behavior.=A0 This is=
 the most=20
common term used because it is what the media has placed the ideas in=
to the=20
mass public that this is what is not to be done, this is not the =
=93The=20
Emergent Norm Perspective=94. The Emergent Norm Perspective is that v=
iew that=20
the media puts into the mass public, the =93right way to act=94.=A0 T=
he actions=20
that were taking by the police that brutally beat Rodney King, were n=
ot=20
right.=A0 Also, the actions that the people of the city of South Cent=
ral Los=20
Angeles were not right.=A0 These ideas are perceived by many and one =
article=20
states =93Collective action theorists emphasize the real grievances, =
rational=20
choices, and organization underlying social movements and revolutions=
, which=20
they distinguish from sudden, short-lived outbreaks of unconventional=
=20
behavior, such as fads, crazes, and hysterias.=94=A0 This is a good d=
efinition=20
to part of the riots.=A0 However, not all is covered within this quot=
e.=A0 The=20
background of what went on in the city which caused the people to rev=
olt.=A0=20
The oppression and socioeconomic problems that occurred, and unfortun=
ately=20
still occur, without any regard from city or government officials.
The other main sociological aspect was the race and ethnicity which w=
as a=20
cause=A0 for concern of=A0 the causes of the=A0 riots.=A0=A0 The race=
 and ethnicity of=20
the population of South Central was predominately seen throughout the=
 entire=20
course of events during the riots and was a major factor that sociolo=
gists=20
looked to as to why these events happened.=A0 There is an abundance o=
f races=20
that live together in Los Angeles.=A0 In South Central there are many=
=20
different races, the most common are Koreans, African Americans and M=
exican=20
Americans.=A0 These are the three most prodminant races that were inv=
olved in=20
the LA=A0 riots.=A0 The Koreans were precieved as the sterotypical st=
ore=20
owners.=A0 The African Americans and the Mexican Americans were the o=
nes=20
causes most of the havok in the streets, or so the media portrayed.=
=A0 In=20
lecture we learned that in Modernization Theory it states that the ra=
cial=A0=20
prejduices that are very preeminent in todays society will go away as=
 the=20
country, and the people, become more modernized.=A0 In the 1990=92s m=
any people=20
thought that the country was becoming very modernized, globally and=
=20
emoncomically.=A0 From these stand points no racial problems should h=
ave=20
occured.=A0 Yet, it seems that when the country is becoming more mode=
rn in=20
theory, that it is not moving as far forward as the people think.=
=A0 The=20
problems that occured from the Rodeny King beatings were all out of h=
atred=20
toward Mr. King because he was a black man.=A0 Some force might have =
been=20
nessacacry becasue he was in persuit by the police because he broke t=
he=20
law.=A0 However, that much beating was wrong.=A0 From this case, and =
other that=20
have happened recently,=A0 racial prejuidices, and the multitude of p=
roblems=20
=66rom that occur from that, have seemed to have gotten worse.
Another sociological problem that helped cause the riots was the clas=
s and=20
stratofication of the community.=A0 An large percentage of the people=
 that=20
make up the community of South Central Los Angeles are in the lower c=
lass.=A0=20
This area of Los Angeles, has a very high crime rate and is impvoeris=
h.=A0=20
=46rom what we learned in lecture people that are at the bottom of th=
e social=20
pyramid have a hard time getting out.=A0 Also, that there are many te=
nsions on=20
the lower class that is placed upon them byt the government.=A0 These=
 are all=20
factors that helped in the people deciding to riot against their neig=
hbors,=20
rather than sit back and watch all of their rights and civil libertie=
s go=20
down the drain.
In conclusion, the 1992 Los Angeles riots were a problem that everyon=
e had=20
to deal with.=A0 This is a problem that seems will continue for a lon=
g time,=20
unlike=A0 the Modernization Theory implied.=A0 Sociology is an easy w=
ay to help=20
define the problem of how this might happen again.
