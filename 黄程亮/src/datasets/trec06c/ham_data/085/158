Not a problem.

I do not have an account on gpg2. Probably that is your personal desktop?
Since you export from pscm1 and mount on your desktop, it is best to change
the uid on gpg2.
I don't know of any more elegant way to do this. 
It's simple: 
Do on gpg2:
   - change your uid in /etc/passwd
   - chown -R <your_home_directory>
   - logout/login again

You can control the access of your home directory on pscm1. If you set the
permissions so that only  you can rwx, nobody else can (theoretically)

The best guess, an upgrade of openssh. 
Tell me what version you're running? Can't check w/o an access...

I tried to do what James have said, but unsuccessfully. I'll send him and
e-mail.

What is node 48? Isn't it the new secondary master?

I am available.
