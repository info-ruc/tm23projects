Which machine was upgraded to 7.2?  The new cluster?  If so, why? (this
could explain why I am no longer able to log on to the new cluster, if
they just did a clean install instead of an upgrade, so I cannot say
about the new one)

For the old cluster, we downloaded the software and put it in:

/home/clas/builds/release-#

Then you cd into /home/clas/builds/release-#/packages and run make.  If
it is successful, update the PRODUCTION link.

Dr. Vineyard did the CLAS setup on the new cluster, but I am sure it is
very similar.  As far as the rich.cshrc file, as long as you update the
PRODUCTION link as mentioned above you shouldnt need to change it (I
assume $CLAS_ROOT is properly set in your environment, such as to
"/home/clas" in the old cluster).  Let me know if this is doesnt help.

Subject: CLAS sofware at UR: MYSQL?

Today I started to install release-4-4 of CLAS sofware on
pscm1. I checked out the software in my account and copy
the sources in
/usr/old-home/clas/builds/release-4-4
(to be side-by-side with the previous releases)

I tried to build and I run into some errors in caldb
related to absence of some mysql header. 
....
calib_connect.c:10:19: mysql.h: No such file or directory
....
At JLAB I have included in the PATH
MYSQL_INCLUDE_PATH=/group/clas/mysql/LinuxRH7/include
MYSQL_LIB_PATH=/group/clas/mysql/LinuxRH6/lib
MYSQL_INCLUDE=/apps/mysql/include/mysql
MYSQL_LIBS=/apps/mysql/lib/mysql

Here comes the question:
Is NOW mysql installed in UR cluster? Where? How/which related variables
were set? It might as well be that you avoid the MySQL

There are some other minor problems - I think Mark Ito will help me clear
them soon. So I'm working on it.
