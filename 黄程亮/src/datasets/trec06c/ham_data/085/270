   No, I don't think I ever exposed the orientation parameter to the GDI 
text rendering routines.  Might be messy to expose, in any case it would 
require sponsorship.

   Not surprising, it's probably got a custom video card in it that hasn't 
had a driver update for eons.

   A quick play with the escapement and orientation parameters to 
CreateFont() indicate that DMDX could in fact do this but the routines that 
determine the dimensions of a piece of text fail so there's some major code 
modifications needed.  And then there's the considerations of line 
placement and so on.  Major major modifications needed.
