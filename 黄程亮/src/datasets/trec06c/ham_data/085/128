Koreans in America



For many years people have been coming to America for hope, determina=
tion and a new life. Many different Asian cultures like China, Japan =
and Korea have been emigrating to America to have a better chance at =
life for themselves and their loved ones. Not only did the three coun=
tries immigrate to America but many more did and continue to do so. K=
oreans have been immigrating to America from the late 1800=92s but th=
e first real wave of Korean immigrants came in 1903. The three week t=
rip from Inch=92on came to an end on January 13, 1903 where the first=
 Korean immigrants entered Honolulu Harbor with 102 Korean soldiers, =
government clerks, students, farmers and a few Buddhist monks. Leavin=
g their homeland due to famine, disease and increasing oppression by =
Japan. The 102 Korean immigrants left Korea to search for a better li=
fe in America. The Korean immigrants have come a long way in America,=
 celebrating the Korean Centennial next year.

In 1883, the first Korean envoys were sent to Washington D.C. as thei=
r first destination in America by Chosun Kingdom (cckigw.org). And th=
at made the first presence of Koreans in America which were political=
 exiles, ginseng merchants, migration laborers and Korean students su=
ch as Pyon Su, the first Korean that graduated from an American colle=
ge. Before the twentieth century there were less than 50 Koreans in A=
merica leading to the first big wave of Korean immigrants to Hawaii.

In 1903, the transpacific steamer SS Gaelic pulled in 56 men, 21 wome=
n, and 25 children to the land of Hawaii, a part of the United States=
. These 102 people started the Korean American community in the Unite=
d States. By 1905 there were 7,226 Koreans as contract laborers for s=
ugar plantations. Koreans were known as hard workers that got paid po=
orly. They worked ten hours from dawn to sunset for sixty-nine cents =
a day. But, in 1905 Japan had cut off Korean immigration to the Unite=
d States leaving Korean population in America low compared to other e=
thnic groups. In 1910, following Japan=92s annexation Korean=92s worl=
d wide rallied for freedom and Korea became and independent nation in=
 1919.

The second wave of Koreans arrived around 1965 after the Korean War a=
s war orphans, wives and relatives of American servicemen who had bee=
n stationed in Korea. One in four Korean Americans can be traced back=
 to a family history from a Korean War bride. The 1965 Immigration Ac=
t abolished discriminatory immigration quotas based on national origi=
n that made a lot of Koreans immigrate to the United States (cckigw.o=
rg). Which was the third and largest wave of Koreans to come to Ameri=
ca.=20

In the 1970-early 1980=92s 30,000 to 35,000 Koreans annually immigrat=
ed to the United States. Many Koreans have come to the United States =
for a better opportunity for their children=92s educations.

In the late 1980=92s Koreans immigrating to the United States have dr=
astically dropped due to better economic, social and political condit=
ions in South Korea. Especially since 1988 when the Seoul Olympic gam=
es were taking place.

=46rom the 1990=92s to now many people go back and forth from Korea a=
nd the United States for opportunities and a way of success. Now ther=
e are around two million Korean ancestry people in the United States =
with around 41,000 in Hawaii.

Korean immigrants came to Hawaii after the Portuguese, Filipinos, and=
 Chinese immigrants along with the Japanese. Koreans first started on=
 the sugar plantations with basically all the other ethnic groups exc=
ept the Caucasions. The Caucasions have mostly led the leadership and=
 boss roles in the economic industry. The Koreans would work hard to =
send money back home and to make a new home in Hawaii. In 1910, Korea=
n communities developed in the =91Ewa Plain, in Wahiawa and Waialua w=
hile other Korean immigrants settled in Honolulu to be tailors, shop =
owners such as furniture makers, and store owners (honoluluadvertiser=
.com). In the 1940=92s Joe Kim opened the first commercial kim chee f=
actory in Honolulu. And Hyo Lim owns a store in Kapalama Shopping Cen=
ter on Dillingham Boulevard called Palama Super Market that sells and=
 produces Korean products. Palama Super Market is a very popular spot=
 for all the Koreans to get products from their homeland. Mr. Lim has=
 come a long way from having nothing. He is even in the proc

Korean food has been a local favorite for some time now. Popular Kore=
an food markets are stores like Palama Super Market and Queens Super =
Market. Great Korean food places have expanded in Hawaii. Many local =
people love these great spots such as Sorabol, Ja Gal Chi Shik Tang, =
Yakiniku Camelia, Kimchee 2, and many more. Kim chee has become a fav=
orite in the islands because of its spicy and tastefulness as well as=
 many other Korean dishes.

As years have gone by Korean people have grown in numbers but not as =
much as other ethnicities. Koreans in Hawaii have come a long way fro=
m 1903. The University of Hawaii, Manoa produces more and more succes=
sful Korean people everyday just like Mr. Lim who is an experienced g=
rocery retailer and wholesaler of Korean products who graduated from =
there in 1975 with a bachelor=91s degree in agriculture. There are ma=
ny successful Koreans in Hawaii and the United States that have come =
a far way. Some stay in the United States and some go back to Korea t=
o make contributions to Korea=92s society. Now there are many many st=
ores like jewelry shops, clothes shops, bars, shoe stores, baggage st=
ores and many more shops owned by Koreans that have made it through t=
he rough times. Other successful people were Syngman Rhee who receive=
d degrees at Harvard and Princeton. He established a church in Hawaii=
 that he was a pastor to. He became the first president of the Republ=
ic of Korea. Another Korean individual that stands out is Sa

There are many Korean generations in Hawaii. The first, second, third=
, fourth, fifth and few sixth and so on. Koreans have a strong and un=
iformed culture. Koreans have a lot of respect for their elders and a=
re very strong willed in working hard to build a foundation for thems=
elves and their families. Koreans are very strong minded and can be s=
tubborn at times. Korean people=92s values and ethics come from their=
 homeland and sticks with them greatly. When talking about Korean peo=
ple there are many that still hold on to their Korean culture here in=
 America which is wonderful but sometimes a conflict with the America=
n ways. Koreans hold their feelings in and ask for minimal help when =
trying to finish a task unless it is definitely needed. Korean belief=
s are very strong and hard to change. Therefore it seems as if there =
are less Korean locals than other ethnicities. But, there are many lo=
cal Koreans in Hawaii as well as other places in the United States. A=
s generations move on there are more local Koreans due to=20

I=92m a second generation because my parents came with my grandparent=
s from Korea and my brother and I were the first one=92s born in Hawa=
ii. Leaving me to the second generation I was brought up in the Korea=
n custom, the Korean culture that is deeply instilled in me. Though I=
 know my culture I consider myself a local because of living here all=
 my life. The fact that my parents want me to better myself in Americ=
a and how I lived in Hawaii growing up with all the things I know tha=
t makes Hawaii a part of me is why I consider myself local. I love th=
e ways of Hawaii how free and open the culture is. Unlike the Korean =
culture where many things are not said and everything is a lot more s=
trict. I love my Korean culture but I have fallen in love with Hawaii=
=92s culture. One thing I am grateful for is the knowing of my Korean=
 language that helps me in Hawaii because of Hawaii=92s diversity in =
people and at school for my language courses. It is great to know a s=
econd language, though you have your advantages and disadvantage

There are many Korean people here in the United States now. More than=
 40% of Korean Americans live on the West side of the United States m=
ostly in Los Angeles=92s Korea Town and other places in Southern Cali=
fornia. Other places many Korean American=92s can be found in are Haw=
aii, New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, and many other urban places.=
 The Korean American community is the fifth largest Asian community i=
n the United States with many significant contributions (asianfortune=
.com).

The Korean American community plays an important role in the United S=
tates economy. The Korean American community owns 135,571 businesses =
that employ 333,000 people (asianfortune.com). Annually making 46 bil=
lion dollars helping the U.S. economy.

A little over a month from now will be the ultimate celebration of th=
e Korean pioneers that set forth a new life in the America=92s coming=
 to Hawaii. The Korean Centennial will be a big celebration honoring =
those spirits who allowed us Korean Americans to have a stature in Am=
erica through their fortitude and hard labor. Korean Centennial commu=
nities are gathering all over the United States to celebrate this imp=
ortant centennial. The U.S. Senate unanimously has passed on a resolu=
tion introduced by Senator George Allen that recognizes the historica=
l significance of the upcoming 100th anniversary of Korean immigratio=
n to the United States (asianfortune.com).

In Hawaii the Korean Centennial is going to be an enormous impact to =
the people due to the fact that the first Korean immigrants first cam=
e to Honolulu harbor. There is going to be a festival and there are m=
any conference=92s going on all over the island because of the Korean=
 Centennial. There are going to be a lot of commemorations like the B=
ishop Museum exhibit and the Korean Centennial Festival in Kapiolani =
Park of January 18, 2003. The Korean Centennial is where the Korean A=
merican Community reflects on the first time our ancestors came to Ha=
waii all the way until today. All the trials, hardships and sorrow th=
at have gone through all that tried to survive in the world will be c=
elebrated and looked at. Korean Americans have just put a mark in his=
tory determined to be equals in the global communities.

Korean American people are slowly but surely making an impact in Amer=
ica as well as the world due to the will of all Koreans. This issue n=
ot only covers the culture that we have discussed in class but global=
 economy, politics, society, and social change. One day we will have =
great stature in the world first starting off by celebrating the Kore=
an Centennial.
