Easily done - and an interesting project!

The trick would be to wire up the R-wave detector to Bit 0 of the PIO 
(which is the request line). Then make sure that you are running in 
"subject request mode" (ie. not <CR>) and voila, your trials will be 
triggered by the occurrence of an R-Wave. You might also want to put some 
blank item 0 events between your trials, so that there is a longer gap 
between stimuli.

Hope this helps,

Matt
