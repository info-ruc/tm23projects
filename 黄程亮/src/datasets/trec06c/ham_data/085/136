In the twentieth century millions upon millions of people have been =
exterminated by genocide. It is quickly becoming an almost unique =
twentieth century phenomenon, and social scientists and sociologists =
still have yet to figure out why it occurs, where is it more likely to =
occur, and even the definitions of the term genocide.  Why is this so =
and what affect will this and does this have on society as a whole. =
Though in history there have been some other cases of genocide as a =
result of wars and conquering empires razing enemy cities to the ground. =
What are some of the underlying basis for a particular culture or set of =
peoples to exterminate another set of peoples? In this paper I intend to =
show that genocide is not a phenomenon unique to the twentieth century =
and also that the underlying basis for genocide is wide ranging and =
cannot be placed under one single motive; also I intend to show that =
sociologists and the United Nations don't give genocide the attention it =
deserves and almost condone it by not producing a definition of it until =
the early twentieth century.=20
	First off a definition of genocide and the controversy surrounding =
current definitions may be useful. The U.N. in 1948 right after World =
War 2 defined genocide as the following:
	"Genocide is the denial of the right of existence of entire human =
groups, as homicide is the denial of the right to live of individual =
human beings; such denial of the right of existence shocks the =
conscience of mankind, results in great losses to humanity in the form =
of cultural and other contributions represented by these groups, and is =
contrary to moral law and to the spirit and aims of the United Nations. =
Many instances of such crimes of genocide have occurred, when racial, =
religious, political and other groups have been destroyed, entirely or =
in part. The General Assembly Therefore, Affirms that genocide is a =
crime under international law which the civilized world condemns, and =
for the commission of which principals and accomplices-whether private =
individuals, public officials or statesmen, and whether the crime is =
committed on religious, racial, political, or any other grounds-are =
punishable."
	The U.N. was pressed to do this because of the horrors coming out of =
Germany and Eastern Europe after the War. The term genocide was first =
coined and linked to other events by Ralph Lemkin in his book Axis Rule =
in Occupied Europe, which was published during World War 2. Lemkin's =
definition thought of genocide as, " a composite of different acts of =
persecution or destruction ," which included attacks on political and =
social institutions, culture, language, national feelings, and the =
economic existence of a group. Lemkin even thought some forms of =
ethnocide were also genocide.
	The U.N. later went on to define genocide as, " any of the following =
acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, =
ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such:
(a) Killing members of the group;
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;
(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated =
to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;
(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;
(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group."

How the United Nations definition differed with Lemkin's definition was =
that it downplayed ethnocide but put in, "political and other groups," =
to Lemkin's list. But  after the Soviet and Eastern bloc protested it =
the political and other groups part was dropped from the convention, " =
because of their mutability and lack of distinguishing characteristics =
[political groups] did not lend themselves to definition, [which] would =
weaken and blur the whole Convention." This is a key flaw especially =
when you have countries like the Soviet union and China imprisoning and =
killing supposed , " enemies of the state." The author's of the book The =
History and Sociology of Genocide Analyses and Case Studies, Frank Chalk =
and Kurt Jonassohn  define genocide as, " a form of one sided mass =
killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group, =
as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator."
	So now definitions are out of the way for now we can talk about the =
history of genocide. If the definition of genocide is not so rigid then =
many  instances in history could be classified as genocides. For example =
when Rome razed long time enemy Carthage this was thought of as normal =
war type behavior albeit cruel and destructive. Also when Genghis Khan =
invaded towns and killed every man woman and child, because the town put =
up resistance to the invaders and also to show other towns that Genghis =
was a bad guy and not to resist his invaders or else. These were thought =
of as side notes in history but they became a lot more than just side =
notes. Also many cultures in the past had human sacrifice and used human =
sacrifices to appease the gods and the blood lust of the gods. So =
religion could be a factor for genocide. Though religion also helped to =
cease the practice of human sacrifice, like when the Hebrews, " who =
transformed the concept of life giving into self-giving."  "Nigel Davies =
contends that once the ancient Hebrews came to see God as good and just, =
human sacrifice ceased. Also the witch persecutions and Spanish =
inquisition were also forms of genocide in Europe in the middle ages.=20
	Nationalities can also play a role, like the often forgotten Armenians =
and their persecution by the Ottoman Turks where a million and a half =
Armenians died and still to this day Turkey denies its existence of any =
wrong doing. Ascriptive characteristics play a big role in genocide, =
whether it be racial, ethnic, gender based, nationality based, or =
religiously based. All of these  identity markers play a role. Victims =
are usually outside of the society perpetrating the genocide and then =
can be labeled them or the others. Countries try to dehumanize the =
people they want to oppress to make it easier for them as well as others =
to oppress them and treat them as  not worthy of life. Also countries =
try to blame economic as well as social problems on the people they want =
to victimize. Like in Germany, which was, enjoying prosperity before =
World War 1 but after was put into a deep recession as the result of =
sanctions placed upon it by the victors of WW1. This sent Germany into =
an economic tailspin and the deutsch mark was worth virtually nothing. =
The German people were looking for someone to blame and found the Jews =
who probably were the easiest target.
	 Conceptually there are four types of genocide the first being genocide =
to eliminate a threat, like the case in Rome where they razed Carthage. =
The second type of genocide is one carried out to terrorize real or =
potential enemies. Genghis Khan's killing entire towns is an example of =
this. Also the gulags in the former USSR are another example of this. =
The  third  example of this is genocide committed for economic gain. =
This is prevalent in Latin America and Cortez as well as in North =
America and European colonialism. The fourth type is different than the =
first three because there is no tangible benefit for the perpetrator. =
The fourth type of genocide is committed to implement a belief, theory, =
or ideology. This is prevalent in the case of the holocaust and the =
Nazi's who persecuted the Jews, Gypsies, and anyone else deemed unworthy =
of life.=20
	What did modernity and the sociologists who believe in modernity have =
to say about genocide and why that was becoming so prevalent in, "modern =
and civilized western societies." Most modernity theorists believed that =
as the world became more connected and as people became more =
individualistic peace would grow and wars would cease because it would =
be inefficient and so peace would be smarter and more efficient. But =
this did not happen as the world became more integrated countries =
started choosing sides in conflicts and world wars came about. Genocide =
also came about in a much more systematic and brutal way which focused =
on efficiency or killing as many people as you can in the shortest time =
possible.  Did genocide lend itself to modernity well or was genocide =
just a perversion of the utopia that modernity theorists described. May =
be the flaw that sociologists and modernity theorists have is that man =
is a rational being capable of making rational choices given the lack of =
information about these choices. Why are people so appalled now when =
they hear of stories from the concentration camps or from the gulags? =
Does modernity have something to do with peoples sensibilities and what =
they consider barbaric, atrocious, or beyond comprehension. People are =
aghast when they see what the Germans did and what, "modern and =
civilized," people are capable of. They think well maybe I too am =
capable of such monstrous inhuman behavior. Stanley Millgram did an =
experiment that showed that most people when told by an authority figure =
to inflict pain on someone else for a specific reason that they will do =
it. This counters sociologists' view of people becoming more peaceful as =
society becomes more modern. Maybe people become more inhuman as =
societies become more modern? Though many civilizations in the past have =
just disappeared and no one knows why, maybe some other culture wiped =
them out, we just don't know.  The frequency and efficiency of these =
recent cases of genocide have alarmed many but it has become less =
shocking and people are becoming numb to the tales of horror and =
killings. Millgram's study showed that an alarming number of us (65 =
percent or more) are capable of harming someone else if an authority =
figure tells us to do so. This study was also shocking to people and =
some still refuse to accept its implications.=20
	Part of what governments did to turn their power into absolute power =
was to turn their people against each other; children were spying on =
their parents and probably the parents were spying on the kids or at =
least the older ones as well. So this would help support the idea that =
genocide relied on some of the ideas of individualism and modernity, =
where families were of less import than the individual person. So in a =
sense more modern societies lent themselves well to genocidal regimes.
	When the U.N. does nothing to stop regimes from committing genocide it =
condones it. The definition is important because countries use loopholes =
to not admit to having committed genocide and therefore are not punished =
or sanctioned by the United Nations. Countries like China and the former =
USSR can reject critics in the UN who claim that they have committed =
genocide because the UN left out political groups in the declaration. So =
the UN is partly to blame for letting genocide continue, but the matter =
is more complex than that. The U.N. walks a tight rope balancing between =
meddling in other countries messy battles and affairs and not getting =
involved. The former Yugoslavia is a example where the UN got involved =
and rounded up people and just handed them over to Milosevic's regime =
knowing that he was going to exterminate them. This is another serious =
problem and one the UN was reviewing. It is difficult to study genocide =
because they are usually hidden or covered up by the countries in =
question, but maybe sociologists and social psychologists can uncover =
the main cause or main causes of genocide and try to stop them before =
they occur or at least stop them before it is too late.

 </span>So
now definitions are out of the way for now we can talk about the hist=
ory of
genocide. If the definition of genocide is not so rigid then many<spa=
n
style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>instances in history could =
be
classified as genocides. For example when Rome razed long time enemy =
Carthage
this was thought of as normal war type behavior albeit cruel and dest=
ructive.
Also when Genghis Khan invaded towns and killed every man woman and c=
hild,
because the town put up resistance to the invaders and also to show o=
ther towns
that Genghis was a bad guy and not to resist his invaders or else. Th=
ese were
thought of as side notes in history but they became a lot more than j=
ust side notes.
Also many cultures in the past had human sacrifice and used human sac=
rifices to
appease the gods and the blood lust of the gods. So religion could be=
 a factor
for genocide. Though religion also helped to cease the practice of hu=
man
sacrifice, like when the Hebrews, &#8220; who transformed the concept=
 of life giving
into self-giving.&#8221;<span style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </sp=
an>&#8220;Nigel Davies
contends that once the ancient Hebrews came to see God as good and ju=
st, human
sacrifice ceased. Also the witch persecutions and Spanish inquisition=
 were also
forms of genocide in Europe in the middle ages. </span></font></p>

 </span>Nationalities
can also play a role, like the often forgotten Armenians and their pe=
rsecution
by the Ottoman Turks where a million and a half Armenians died and st=
ill to
this day Turkey denies its existence of any wrong doing. Ascriptive
characteristics play a big role in genocide, whether it be racial, et=
hnic,
gender based, nationality based, or religiously based. All of these<s=
pan
style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>identity markers play a rol=
e. Victims are
usually outside of the society perpetrating the genocide and then can=
 be
labeled them or the others. Countries try to dehumanize the people th=
ey want to
oppress to make it easier for them as well as others to oppress them =
and treat
them as<span style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>not worthy of =
life. Also
countries try to blame economic as well as social problems on the peo=
ple they
want to victimize. Like in Germany, which was, enjoying prosperity be=
fore World
War 1 but after was put into a deep recession as the result of sancti=
ons placed
upon it by the victors of WW1. This sent Germany into an economic tai=
lspin and
the deutsch mark was worth virtually nothing. The German people were =
looking
for someone to blame and found the Jews who probably were the easiest=
 target.</span></font></p>

 </span><span
style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Conceptually there are four =
types of
genocide the first being genocide to eliminate a threat, like the cas=
e in Rome
where they razed Carthage. The second type of genocide is one carried=
 out to
terrorize real or potential enemies. Genghis Khan&#8217;s killing ent=
ire towns is an
example of this. Also the gulags in the former USSR are another examp=
le of
this. The<span style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>third<span
style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>example of this is genocide=
 committed
for economic gain. This is prevalent in Latin America and Cortez as w=
ell as in
North America and European colonialism. The fourth type is different =
than the
first three because there is no tangible benefit for the perpetrator.=
 The
fourth type of genocide is committed to implement a belief, theory, o=
r
ideology. This is prevalent in the case of the holocaust and the Nazi=
&#8217;s who
persecuted the Jews, Gypsies, and anyone else deemed unworthy of life=
. </span></font></p>

 </span>What
did modernity and the sociologists who believe in modernity have to s=
ay about
genocide and why that was becoming so prevalent in, &#8220;modern and=
 civilized
western societies.&#8221; Most modernity theorists believed that as t=

more connected and as people became more individualistic peace would =
grow and
wars would cease because it would be inefficient and so peace would b=
e smarter
and more efficient. But this did not happen as the world became more =
integrated
countries started choosing sides in conflicts and world wars came abo=
ut.
Genocide also came about in a much more systematic and brutal way whi=
ch focused
on efficiency or killing as many people as you can in the shortest ti=
me
possible.<span style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did genocide=
 lend itself
to modernity well or was genocide just a perversion of the utopia tha=
t
modernity theorists described. May be the flaw that sociologists and =
modernity
theorists have is that man is a rational being capable of making rati=
onal
choices given the lack of information about these choices. Why are pe=
ople so
appalled now when they hear of stories from the concentration camps o=
r from the
gulags? Does modernity have something to do with peoples sensibilitie=
s and what
they consider barbaric, atrocious, or beyond comprehension. People ar=
e aghast
when they see what the Germans did and what, &#8220;modern and civili=
zed,&#8221; people are
capable of. They think well maybe I too am capable of such monstrous =
inhuman
behavior. Stanley Millgram did an experiment that showed that most pe=
ople when
told by an authority figure to inflict pain on someone else for a spe=
cific
reason that they will do it. This counters sociologists&#8217; view o=
f people
becoming more peaceful as society becomes more modern. Maybe people b=
ecome more
inhuman as societies become more modern? Though many civilizations in=
 the past
have just disappeared and no one knows why, maybe some other culture =
wiped them
out, we just don&#8217;t know.<span style=3D"mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp=
; </span>The
frequency and efficiency of these recent cases of genocide have alarm=
ed many
but it has become less shocking and people are becoming numb to the t=
ales of
horror and killings. Millgram&#8217;s study showed that an alarming n=
umber of us (65
percent or more) are capable of harming someone else if an authority =
figure
tells us to do so. This study was also shocking to people and some st=
ill refuse
to accept its implications. </span></font></p>

 </span>Part
of what governments did to turn their power into absolute power was t=
o turn
their people against each other; children were spying on their parent=
s and
probably the parents were spying on the kids or at least the older on=

well. So this would help support the idea that genocide relied on som=

ideas of individualism and modernity, where families were of less imp=

the individual person. So in a sense more modern societies lent thems=

to genocidal regimes.</span></font></p>

 </span>When
the U.N. does nothing to stop regimes from committing genocide it con=
dones it.
The definition is important because countries use loopholes to not ad=
mit to
having committed genocide and therefore are not punished or sanctione=
d by the
United Nations. Countries like China and the former USSR can reject c=
ritics in
the UN who claim that they have committed genocide because the UN lef=
t out
political groups in the declaration. So the UN is partly to blame for=
 letting
genocide continue, but the matter is more complex than that. The U.N.=
 walks a
tight rope balancing between meddling in other countries messy battle=
s and
affairs and not getting involved. The former Yugoslavia is a example =
where the
UN got involved and rounded up people and just handed them over to Mi=
losevic&#8217;s
regime knowing that he was going to exterminate them. This is another=
 serious
problem and one the UN was reviewing. It is difficult to study genoci=
de because
they are usually hidden or covered up by the countries in question, b=
ut maybe
sociologists and social psychologists can uncover the main cause or m=
ain causes
of genocide and try to stop them before they occur or at least stop t=

it is too late.</span></font></p>
