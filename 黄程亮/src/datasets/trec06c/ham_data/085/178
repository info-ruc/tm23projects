Dear All,

There is a new set of single muon and dimuon skims. Please look in,

 /work/creek-clued0/tmb-trees/p1304_dec_set2_v3
(root-trees are being copied over from d0mino)

The single muon skim should have 2,945,462 events and the dimuon skim,
595,444.

In this set, dimuons were chosen with events having a "dimuon trigger"
and "nseg>=1" muons. Single muons were chosen with the "single muon
trigger" and nseg=3 cuts. The same event can be in both skims (since an
event can fire both the single and dimuon triggers).

Please take a look and let us know if there are any problems.

Vivek

p.s. the old set can be found at,

 /work/cherokee-clued0/tmb-trees/p1304_dec_set1_v2
