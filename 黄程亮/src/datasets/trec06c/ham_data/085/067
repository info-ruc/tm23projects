CERT Summary CS-2002-04

   November 26, 2002

   Each  quarter, the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) issues the CERT
   Summary  to  draw  attention  to  the types of attacks reported to our
   incident  response  team,  as  well  as  other noteworthy incident and
   vulnerability information. The summary includes pointers to sources of
   information for dealing with the problems.

   Past CERT summaries are available from:

Recent Activity

   Since the last regularly scheduled CERT summary, issued in August 2002
   (CS-2002-03),   we   have   seen   trojan  horses  for  three  popular
   distributions,  new  self-propagating malicious code (Apache/mod_ssl),
   and  multiple  vulnerabilities  in BIND. In addition, we have issued a
   new PGP Key.

   For  more  current  information  on  activity  being  reported  to the
   CERT/CC,  please  visit the CERT/CC Current Activity page. The Current
   Activity  page  is  a  regularly updated summary of the most frequent,
   high-impact  types  of  security  incidents  and vulnerabilities being
   reported  to the CERT/CC. The information on the Current Activity page
   is reviewed and updated as reporting trends change.

    1. Apache/mod_ssl Worm

       Over  the  past  several  months,  we  have  received reports of a
       self-propagating  malicious  code  that  exploits  a vulnerability
       (VU#102795)  in  OpenSSL. Reports received by the CERT/CC indicate
       that  the  Apache/mod_ssl  worm  has already infected thousands of
       systems.  Over  a  month  earlier,  the CERT/CC issued an advisory
       (CA-2002-23) describing four remotely exploitable buffer overflows
       in OpenSSL.

		Vulnerability Note #102795
		OpenSSL  servers contain a buffer overflow during the 
		SSL2 handshake process
		http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/102795


    2. Trojan Horse Sendmail Distribution

       The  CERT/CC  has  received  confirmation  that some copies of the
       source  code  for  the  Sendmail  package have been modified by an
       intruder  to  contain a Trojan horse. These copies began to appear
       in  downloads  from  the  FTP server ftp.sendmail.org on or around
       September  28,  2002.  On  October  8, 2002, the CERT/CC issued an
       advisory   (CA-2002-28)   describing  various  methods  to  verify
       software authenticity.

    3. Trojan Horse tcpdump and libpcap Distributions

       The  CERT/CC  has  received reports that some copies of the source
       code  for  libpcap,  a  packet acquisition library, and tcpdump, a
       network  sniffer,  have been modified by an intruder and contain a
       Trojan  horse.  These  modified  distributions  began to appear in
       downloads  from  the  HTTP server www.tcpdump.org on or around Nov
       11,  2002. The CERT/CC issued an advisory (CA-2002-30) listing MD5
       checksums and official distribution sites for libpcap and tcpdump.

    4. Multiple Vulnerabilities in BIND

       The  CERT/CC  has documented multiple vulnerabilities in BIND, the
       popular  domain  name  server  and client library software package
       from  the  Internet  Software  Consortium  (ISC).  Some  of  these
       vulnerabilities  may  allow a remote intruder to execute arbitrary
       code  with  privileges  of  the  the user running named (typically
       root).  Several  vulnerabilities  are  referenced in the advisory;
       they are listed here individually.

    5. Heap  Overflow  Vulnerability  in Microsoft Data Access Components
       (MDAC)

       On  November  21, 2002 the CERT/CC issued an advisory (CA-2002-33)
       describing  a  vulnerability  in  MDAC,  a collection of Microsoft
       utilities and routines that process requests between databases and
       network applications.
