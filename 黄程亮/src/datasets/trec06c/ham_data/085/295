I'd appreciate some feedback on the viability of a concept that I would like to implement in DMDX.

The background is a study of neural and autonomic responses to stimuli.  It is well known that some neural and autonomic responses to stimuli (e.g. heart rate deceleration ~ orienting response) are dependent on when in the cardiac cycle the stimulus is delivered.  

The concept is simple:  a reaction time measurement to an occasional (random ISI) stimulus, except that the stimulus is always delivered 200 msec after an ECG R-wave.

Do you suppose that DMDX could wait for a PIO-12 input trigger signal (from a ECG R-wave detector), wait 200 msec, execute a stimulus presentation,  gather a reaction time and then go to sleep for some seconds (random ISI) before triggering on the next available R-wave?

I suppose that the fMRI peoples must want to coordinate DMDX with scans as well?

Thanks,

Derek
