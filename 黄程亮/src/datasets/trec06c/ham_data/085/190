Hi Gerry,

I'm very happy to hear that everything is going so good with your cluster.

To answer both of your questions,  I have attached documentation for Nimbus 
in a tar.gz file and a quote in pdf format.  The quote is for three 
additional nodes for your cluster.  I was able to get you some deep discounts 
for the good pr you provided us earlier this month.

Please give me a call to discuss the quote.  In the mean time,  have a happy 
holiday season and I am looking forward to talking to you soon again.

With best regards,

Markus Geiger

Subject: compiled versus interpreted C++ classes in Root
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

yo,

   i just got done comparing the analysis time for a root
class that used Root's CINT and the same class that was
compiled with root. it was non-trivial getting this to work 
(more thanks to steven james). the makefile is below. the
difference between the two is LARGE; a factor of 83. the 
results from root are below. this means if we're going to
do production running on the cluster we should compile our code
with root.

later,

jerry

results from root for interpreted code.

Hi Steven,

   Happy New Year and yet another question about the Richmond cluster. 
I have been experimenting with different ways of running the cluster 
and I have run into a problem with the batch system. I'm submitting 
jobs in two different ways; one uses the beomap command to allocate 
slave nodes and the other just picks the slave nodes `by hand'. I'm 
using this second method because the limiting factor now is the 
ability to transfer the data files to the slave nodes. I was thinking 
that I could transfer the data on the first pass and leave it there 
for later passes to speed things up. The problem now is that after 
many jobs are submitted (from 60-100 of so) the remaining jobs get 
sent to the `b' batch queue and never run. This has happened even when 
the /var/spool area is not full. My thoughts are the following.

1. Can we reset the average cpu load with the 'atd -l' command? I've 
tried this and it seems to have little effect.

2. Can we restart the jobs in the queue? Now they just sit there and 
never get started.

3. In some of the recent analysis runs, the /var/spool/mqueue area has 
filled up and hung things up. Before it was the /var/spool/at or 
/var/spool/mail areas. Do you have any idea what would cause that? 
Should we make a link for /var/spool/mqueue to one of RAID disks so 
there is plenty of space?

Let me know what you think?

Thanks-in-advance,

jerry
