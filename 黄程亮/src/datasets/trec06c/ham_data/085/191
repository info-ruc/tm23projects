Subject: How to Stop Telephone Harrasment by IBM?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  Here is a **very disturbing** report
to start the day's news. This occassionally happens where a large 
company gets off in an orbit of their own, colliding with the rest
of the world, and no one/nothing seems able to stop them. The last
time I reported something like this, it was when First National Bank
of Chicago was harassing a family in Germany with unwanted fax phone
calls, and nothing would stop the bank from making their calls until
(the old) Illinois Bell Telephone Company literally went to the bank's
premises in downtown Chicago prepared to disconnect the phone line in
question and carry away the fax machine. The story has been told many
times; now today IBM is the culprit. Let's see how long it takes IBM
to wise up or stop the harassment; if they ever do.  PAT]
 
                   ===========================

Hello,

I'm looking for suggestions ( non-malicious please) to get the
harrasment that has been confirmed to be coming from an IBM site to
stop.

I am tempted to hook up my computer to the line and see if I can get a
terminal session.  It's like reverse hacking, instead of me trying to
get to them, they just call me and open a terminal session.  However,
I really just want the calls to stop.

Any ideas?

Any legal contacts in California that might be able to help me pursue
this?  And by pursue -- I mean give them a deterrent that will make IBM
listen ($$$) and one that will make me welcome a few more calls -- so
I can keep on suing them.

Thanks,

JM

<<text of email thread with a privacy rights group >>

I'll provide a little more detail:

The calls started in October and come up on my caller ID as "out of 
area" with no phone number attached.

I had this happen before when I first got the phone number, it appears
that my number was an old billing number for Arch Wireless. Users of
the Arch wireless service would have a computer call in their billing
records via modem to my phone number.

So I get 30-45 calls daily from an unknown number.  I had Pacific Bell 
put a trace on the call and they contacted the company responsible for 
the calls.  They would not release the company name to me directly but 
would only do so with a police report.  The company refused to return 
Pacific Bell's phone calls so I opened the police report.  The officer 
was able to get the number that was showing up on Pac Bell's caller ID 
and also the name of the company (IBM).

The officer contacted IBM at the site where the calls were coming
from.  They asked for one week to investigate and resolve the
situation.  I waited two weeks.  The timeframe is now mid-November.  I
followed up with the police officer and he called his contact at IBM.
His contact disputed the information traced by Pacific Bell to his
number and said that we were wrong.  I then reactivated the trace and
explained this to Pacific Bell.  Pacific Bell confirmed that there is
no way that the trace is incorrect and that they have re-confirmed
that the calls are coming from IBM.

I have logged over 300 phone calls with dates, and times.  I still get 
30-45 calls daily.

My local police officer has not gotten any additional information from
IBM.  He has provided them with the updated information and the
confirmation that this is coming from their telephone number.  They
have not responded to him.

I have asked that he refer this case to the District Attorney in my
area so that this will become a criminal harassment case.  While this
is still a misdemeanor, it is also still harassment.

I am also considering pursuing this in civil court.  The calls come at
all hours of the day and night.  It is easy enough to ignore the calls
during the day but at 2:00am, I must answer the phone each time it
rings because it could be an emergency call from someone that I know.

In civil court I believe I can obtain punitive damages since IBM has
had the opportunity to resolve this and refused to do so.  I have
contacted an attorney about a civil case and we are investigating who
would be the defendant in this matter.

I am also considering small claims court but need to confirm
jurisdiction.

I'm open to hearing about attorneys that have experience in this area
as well as other possible solutions.  I have had my days and nights
interrupted by this for almost 90 days and do feel some restitution is
in order. Please feel free to pass this message along to the IBM
privacy officer.

I'm very sorry for the delay in responding.

I find this most disconcerting. Do you yourself have the phone number
that was identified by the phone company?

I am not at the office right now, but I'd like to contact IBM's
privacy officer about this. In the meantime, you might want to do the
same. If you go to their web site, you can click on their privacy
policy, and I think you can send an email msg to the privacy officer.

Do you know why IBM is calling you? Do they leave any messages?

Also, I'm pretty sure IBM is a member of TRUSTe. You should file a
complaint about them with www.truste.org and see if they can help you.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: How typical ... corporation denies they
are idiots and causing harassment; police and others who *could* take
agressive action to stop it do not really comprehend what is happening
so just shrug their shoulders and walk away from it. Corporation then
continues harassment unmolested. In the case at First National Bank of
Chicago (now they have changed their brand name a couple times since)
had these German people in tears. Over and over, all night long for a
month or two, the calls were coming in from the USA. This was back
before the system could automatically trace calls and those things had
to be done manually. After repeated complaints of 'phone ringing then
dead silence when we answered' from the people, Bundespost finally got
AT&T on the wire and asked them to investigate. It was traced back to
Illinois Bell, who then tracked it back to the bank, a full month or
more after the calls were going on nightly. The bank totally ignored
requests from Illinois Bell to fix the problem. Finally a security rep
went from Bell over to the bank with a legal notice and an ultimatum;
'we are turning off your phones at (whatever time was permitted under
the law) because you will not correct this problem.' The notice was
given by telco to the Vice President-Telecom for the bank who went
downstairs with a vengeance to correct the problem himself. After a
bit of rudeness by him, the problem got corrected. And the idiots have
such short term memory problems; a month or so later when the bank got
a phone bill with page after page after page after page of one minute
phone calls to Germany at hours in the middle of the night when the
bank was closed, they complained 'Bell really screwed up our phone
bill this month' and wanted credit for all those calls.

I finally had to complain to the State Commission here in Kansas about
the way Southwestern Bell's alleged Privacy Manager does not work (the
one they charge people BIG $$ for without actually providing any
service for the money.) And guess who *my* culprit was?  A divison of
*AT&T* who was getting around caller-ID by filling the screen with
'name unavailable' and ten zeros for a phone number. Do any of you
young'uns remember when the phone company used to actually take
seriously their obligations toward their customer's privacy and not
just mock and humor the customers with things like Privacy Manager?
Good luck to our latest victim from IBM. Let's see how long it takes
to get them straightened out. I wonder if he has considered putting
'privacy manager' (snicker) on his phone line or call blocking?  PAT]

Subject: Nokia vs. Microsoft


A few weeks back, Monty posted an article from the Economist
speculating whether Nokia or Microsoft would control the evolution of
handheld computing.  I wrote the attached to the editors at the
Economist; they are apparently not going to run it, and seems a shame
to waste a good rant:

Gentlemen:

I read with great interest your article "Nokia vs Microsoft". I
believe (and have for some time) that it is not merely an issue of two
companies competing for the same dollars, but two modes of computer
interaction trying to find the right balance.

Most mobile phone users would not describe themselves of interacting
with a computer system, but that is exactly what they are doing - the
handset is but a terminal attached to a very large distributed system.
In the early 1990s, researchers at the Xerox Palo Alto Research
Center, led by Mark Weiser, put forth the idea of "ubiquitous
computing" -- see

 <URL http://www.ubiq.com/hypertext/weiser/UbiHome.html >

where a key element of the model was that mobile terminals are not
standalone, but are in communication with one another and a large
system behind them. The mobile phone-as-computer is an excellent
example of what Weiser called an "invisible system".

Microsoft's (and those of other manufacturers who are pushing into the
handheld space) systems are anything but invisible. They are, largely,
based on the idea that the computer must be self-contained,
standalone, out of touch. They also have a tendency to try to take
applications that were developed for large machines with large
displays and large input devices and squash them down into an
environment that has a minimalist processor, simplistic display, and
barely adequate input. No wonder that "convergence" devices have been
such dismal failures!

Your discussion omits completely a very important set of players: the
wireless carriers themselves. They control the technology, network
access, billing, technology, content and user experience in a way that
Microsoft (and large ISPs) can only dream of.

The past several years have brought an effort by US mobile carriers to
imitate the success of SMS in the GSM world, without much success.
There are many reasons for this - carrier implementation missteps
aside - but I believe that in large part it is because the financial
models and user expectations that form the background of use are
completely different.

In the US, network consumers were raised on flat rate fixed-wire phone
service. This carried over to web access and wireless rate plans:
consumers are accustomed to flat fee unlimited access web browsing
from home and work and generous billing plans that provide a surfeit
of "free" talk minutes - so many minutes that most consumers can't use
them all. AOL's current advertising scheme offers so many free minutes
that you can't use them up in the number of days they remain valid.
Voice plans usually begin with a "bucket" of 200 minutes/month for
US$20.

The always-on Internet access in the US has taught users to expect
high-quality, high-bandwidth content delivery. Communication is via
instant messaging, with a constant view into the reachability and
status of their IM "buddies".

On the other hand, until recently, US mobile phone users could only
send SMS messages to users on their same wireless network. Carriers
are now counting on SMS to increase their revenue growth, but don't
make a compelling case for the functionality or cost. They have broken
the longstanding financial model by introducing usage-sensitive
pricing: SMS messages typically cost US$0.10, often both incoming and
outgoing.  Why would users want to pay per-message fees to thumb type,
when they can just make a voice call for "free"?

The rest of the world has grown up with usage sensitive pricing for
fixed telephone usage, and web and wireless pricing continues to
follow that model.  Thus, the rest of the world is not so well
connected to the Internet (if at all), doesn't have flat rate Internet
access, and pays for every minute of talk.  In this model, SMS makes
financial sense: an SMS costs less than 1/4 of a voice minute, and
both minutes and messages are pay-as-you-go. Users are accustomed to
small displays and small devices and wonder why they should be
expected to carry something too bulky to fit in a pocket. Carriers
were happy to have SMS messages use up the idle capacity of their
networks.

To put it bluntly, the wireless experience in the US is that of trying
to cram a full PC into a portable phone; in the rest of the world, it
has been a slow expansion of functionality on devices that consumers
are carrying anyway.

Nokia (and other mobile phone technologists) have continued to build
systems that are based on communication; they slowly add more
functionality (such as SMS, and now MMS) to those systems. Third
parties have built very powerful, if deceptively simple, applications
on top of these systems. Users of the GSM mobile telephony system have
used these two-way systems for many years; the success and growth of
SMS messaging is a testament to their utility.

Microsoft (and other computer technologists) have built, and continue
to build, systems that are meant to stand alone. The Microsoft
Smartphone platform is no different - it just happens to have a phone
and Internet connection in it. I don't really believe that the ability
to browse the web will make it that much more succesful - it didn't
work for WAP, did it?

I believe that the "one, true way" lies somewhere between - but closer
to well-designed applications that involve personalized communication
with a smart backend system, rather than more and more powerful
devices that are carried in one's pocket. My personal bet is on Nokia;
they don't have the baggage to jettison that Microsoft do.

The mobile carriers still have the opportunity to foul it up for both
sides - especially by trying to equate the pricing of data bytes with
voice minutes, to maximize their short-term profits at the expense of
user experience and content/application availability. Trying to meet
fixed-line expectations with (expensive) wireless bandwidth is a
recipe for disaster.

(I have written about this at length in various guises; one readily
accessible though not very polished version can be found at

According to http://www.e-searchwireless.com (subsciption necessary)
there were 129,375,600 cellphones active in the US last
month. Penetration at end of 2001 was under 46% - still very low by
the standards of many other industrialised economies. Finland had 83%
penetration (although I'm not sure if that figure was before or after
the industry adjusted the published subscriber figiures to make their
ARPU look better).

Aren't there still some phone companies that charge for the
"privilege" of using touch tone dialing (or "touch calling" as it was
called by GTE)?

What usually happens is that these cheapskates will then switch the
phone to tone when they need to access a voice mail or interactive

That's the history of Microsoft. Let someone else pioneer a product or

It is very good to be Microsoft-free in my computing these days!

Okay ... I said my piece and gave my examples a while back, when this
thread was new. Then, I let it drop when it became apparent to me that
John's position is more philosophical than factual. I appreciate what
he's saying, and there are many instances where it's true -- perhaps
more often than not.

I'm chiming back in, though, because I'm pretty certain John has his
facts wrong on this point (and others, perhaps ...?). I'll concede
that GE and Hotpoint major appliances are the same basic boxes, and
that Whirlpool, some KitchenAid, and most Kenmore major appliances are
the same boxes.

GE and Whirlpool, though, are two distinctly different lines. Both use
some components (timers, motors, electronics, solenoids, and maybe
even some trim parts) that come from the same manufacturers and may
even be identical.  However, cabinets, transmissions, and other major
"brand-identity" components are different on all examples I've
seen. John may have "examined" them, but I've repaired a number of
both GE and Whirlpool (including Kenmore) appliances, and the design
and assembly techniques are distinct.

Since I'm not in the appliance industry, I can't be absolutely certain
that there's no crossover. I'd concede this point if John (or someone
else) can give me an example of one major appliance -- one Whirlpool
model number and one GE model number -- that are identifiable as the
same basic machine.

That will come as a big surprise to the GE engineers, a few miles from

Maybe they think the new brand is better than the old one.  How can they

Because the name isn't the only asset that a company has.  They bought it
for its customer base, employees, technology, etc.

But it's not the *same* board that decided to start a national branding
campaign many years before the takeover.

When Ted Turner ran his own media empire, he went around naming
everything he could Turner This and Turner That.  When he sold out to
Time Warner, he no longer had the control of the board that allowed
him this freedom.

Because they want the public to recognize that this is the "new and
improved" company, not the same old one.  Or sometimes the new company
that results from the mergers has different goals than the old one,
and the old name doesn't fit.  For instance, I've noticed over the
years that lots of public utility companies would branch out into
other industries, and then the old name no longer describes them well.
When XXX Electric is no longer solely in the electric power business,
but is a holding company for many different types of businesses, a
name change is appropriate; some companies simply adopted their
initials (e.g. I think Wiscon Electric Power became WEP Holdings),
while others go for a coined name that doesn't pigeonhole them (Boston
Edison became NSTAR and Boston Gas became Keyspan Energy).

I have been posting for fifteen years or so.  More, actually.

And that your fulfillment as a human being is not dependent on "Usenet
posters" doesn't mean that you're not wrong.  You did put forth your
case in the court of public opinion, and you failed -- miserably -- to
make that case.

The bank will cash them anyway. Even if you make the check payable to,
say, Richard Notebaert, they'll probably still cash the check. And
Notebaert isn't even *with* SBC anymore.

CRTC POSTS REPORT ON CANADIAN TELECOM: As this issue went to press,
the CRTC released its second annual report to Cabinet on Canada's
Telecommunications Industry. The full report is available at:
http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/reports/PolicyMonitoring/2002/gic2002.pdf

============================================================

WE'RE TAKING A HOLIDAY: Telecom Update is taking a winter break; our
next issue will be published Monday, January 6. We wish all readers a
successful and rewarding New Year.

NEWFOUNDLAND BANS HANDSET USE WHILE DRIVING: 

Newfoundland has adopted Canada's first law banning the use of
handheld cellphones while driving. Offenders will lose demerit points
and pay a fine of $45-$180.

BCE TO CUT 1,700 MORE JOBS: 

In 2003, BCE Inc. will cut capital spending by 10%-15% and eliminate
about 1,700 jobs in 2003. At the company's annual investor conference,
BCE executives forecast revenue of $19.5 billion in the next year.

** CEO Michael Sabia said that CTV and the Globe and Mail are
    not strategic assets, but did not suggest any plan to sell
    them soon.

** Separately, Bell announced that it is in discussions
    regarding possible divestiture of some or all of its
    investment in CGI Group.

TELUS FORECASTS INCREASED SALES, PROFITS: 

Telus Corp. says a workforce reduction of 5,000 by year-end will
contribute to an increase in EBITDA of 8% to 12% and a return to
profitability in 2003. Sales are expected to rise 3%-4%; capital
expenditures will be reduced 12%.

COURT REJECTS LEDCOR APPEAL: 

In a 2-1 decision, the Federal Court of Appeal has dismissed the
appeal by the Federation of Canadian Municipalities and several cities
against CRTC Decision 2001-23, the "Ledcor Decision." The Court
rejected FCM's argument that the CRTC exceeded its jurisdiction when
it restricted the municipalities' ability to charge carriers for using
rights-of-way. (See Telecom Update #354)

VIDEOTRON BUYS ONTARIO FIBRE: 

Videotron Telecom has purchased 1,200 km of dark fibre in Ontario from
360networks, including routes from Ottawa to Toronto, Toronto to
Buffalo, and Toronto to Detroit. (See Telecom Update #326)

BELL ABSORBS ALIANT NETWORK GROUPS: 

130 management employees in Aliant's technology development and
network planning/ provisioning functions are being transferred to Bell
Canada, as part of a plan to unify the two companies' network
operations.

RURAL BROADBAND SELECTION COMMITTEE NAMED: 

Industry Minister Allan Rock has announced the members of the National
Selection Committee for the Broadband for Rural and Northern
Development pilot program (see Telecom Update #348). Names and
biographies of the committee members and a list of all 223
applications for the Round 1 competition are posted on the Industry
Canada website.

http://broadband.gc.ca/applications/applist_e.asp

CITY WANTS 613 OVERLAY DECISION REVISITED: 

The City of Ottawa says it supports the proposal to delay introduction
of 10- digit local dialing in 613 until 2006, and to indefinitely
postpone an Area Code overlay. The City's lawyers say that it wants to
revisit the overlay decision in future, because "there may be some
advantage ... in adopting a geographical split."

TED ROGERS SUCCESSION SET? 

Rogers Cable CEO John Tory has been named Chairman of the company,
replacing Ted Rogers.  Edward Rogers, son of Ted, has been named
President and COO.

TELUS TO TRIAL IMAGIC SOFTWARE: 

iMagicTV is supplying its Media Manager 5.0 software to Telus for a
trial of digital TV service delivery over phone lines.

INTERNET TV LAW IN FORCE: 

Bill C-11, an "Act to Amend the Copyright Act," is now law. The
amendment prevents "Internet retransmitters" of TV programs from
holding the compulsory licences that permit cable and satellite
broadcasters to use TV programs for a fixed royalty -- they must
negotiate their own agreements with copyright holders.

http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/2/parlbus/chambus/house/bills/government/C-11/C-11_4/90174bE.html

EXPRESSVU SAYS CABLECOS HAVE THEFT PROBLEM TOO:

Bell ExpressVu has released a study by Pathlink Engineering claiming
that Canadian cable companies lose over $400 million each year due to
unauthorized use of cable broadcasts. The cablecos earlier accused
ExpressVu of being too lax in policing signal theft. (See Telecom
Update #359)

http://www.bell.ca/shop/en/jsp/content/aboutbell/expressvu/newsreleases/pdfdocs/pathlink.pdf

ONTARIO RESEARCH NETWORK TO USE BELL FIBRE: 

The Optical Regional Advanced Network of Ontario (ORANO) has granted
Bell Canada a $25 million contract to supply fibre and equipment for a
research network linking about 100 educational institutions and
research facilities in 21 communities. (See Telecom Update #316)

http://www.orion.on.ca

CANARIE FUNDS DISTANCE LEARNING DEVELOPMENT: 

CANARIE has awarded $1.56 million to the Advanced Broadband Enabled
Learning project, which aims to help teachers learn to use broadband
networks as teaching tools.

http://www.abelearn.ca

BELL OFFERS WIRELESS LOCATION-BASED SERVICES: 

Bell Mobility subscribers in Ontario and Quebec can now obtain
directions and other location-based services from MyFinder, which
locates the user's closest cellphone tower. Price: 25 cents per
request plus airtime charges.

CAIP MERGES WITH CATA: 

The Canadian Association of Internet Providers is merging with the
Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance. CAIP will continue to have its
own Board of Directors.

PRESIDENT OF BROADBAND USER GROUP RESIGNS: 

Chris Weisdorf, founder of the Residential Broadband Users'
Association, has resigned as President of the volunteer group. RBUA's
advocacy efforts are unlikely to continue. (See Telecom Update #276,
335)

CANADIAN SATELLITE LAUNCH SET: 

Telesat's Nimiq 3 satellite is scheduled for launch from Kazakhstan on
December 30. Bell ExpressVu has booked the satellite's entire capacity
for high-definition television, pay-per-view programming, and other
services.

RIM POSTS $92 MILLION LOSS: 

Research In Motion lost US$92 million in the three months ended
November 30, compared to a $6 million loss last year. One-time charges
totaled $72 million, including $28 million for legal costs and
damages.  Revenue of $34.5 million was up 3% from the previous quarter
and 30% from the same period last year.

GT CHANGES WIN CREDITOR SUPPORT: 

More than 95% of Group Telecom creditors have backed the
reorganization plan providing for GT's purchase by 360networks. GT
will seek court approval in Ontario on December 23, and in the U.S. on
January 2.

SHAW RATING CUT TO JUNK STATUS: 

Moody's Investors Service has lowered its rating on Shaw
Communications unsecured debt by two steps to Ba2 -- "junk"
status. The agency says Shaw has too much debt and faces stiff
competition.

COM DEV BACK IN THE BLACK: 

Com Dev International, a satellite technology supplier, recorded
August-October net income of $748,000, compared to a loss of $89
million during the same period last year. Revenue was $25.2 million,
down from $32.6 million. (See Telecom Update #347)

MERITON RAISES $26 MILLION: 

Ottawa-based Meriton Networks, which makes combined
switching/transmission gear for metro optical networks, has raised
C$26.4 million in equity and debt financing.

THE HIDDEN COSTS OF IP TELEPHONY: 

When McGill University looked at IP telephony, it found that the cost
of preparing for a voice-data network would be much greater than
anyone expected. Read full details in an exclusive insider report,
only in the January issue of Telemanagement.

Subject: We Had Better Cool it a Little


To the group:

We (in an editorial sense, meaning I, the buffer of all messages here in
this department) have started getting complaints about the quality and
enduring significance as my competitor, Readers Digest would say, of the
messages printed here. 

To wit, the 'branding thread' is starting to get on some people's nerves.

Names are not neccessary; they don't matter:

Pat:

I'm sure you have standards and rules you operate the list within, and
perhaps the current situation is within those rules, but things are
getting out of hand.

John Higdon and his band of merry "I'm smarter than you" men are
destroying the value of the list, in this reader's opinion.

It is declining from a source of good information to stupid infighting
between so called 'intellectuals'.

How about telling them to take the silliness private?  I would prefer
to read the list, in the limited time I have available, and glean
mostly telecom related information, not a bunch of grown up 'kids'
slinging mud back and forth.

I notice, for the record, that Higdon and several others rarely offer
anything constructive, just the childishness that is SO much more
obvious in this 'branding' thread.

                     =========================


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Reaction: Sitting here with mouth open, a
little embarrassed to have to mention it ... but golly gee, guys, why
not move anything further on the 'branding thread' over to email, if
you can get through all the spam congestion and blocks these days to
pass your messages, or maybe to Yahoo or AOL Instant Messengers,
where, once you get through the obligitory 'm or f?  how old?'
questions (and in more recent times the request to check out the other
guy's 'cam' [if the first two questions are answered in a pleasing
way; otherswise why bother]), you can get back to the branding thread,
or whatever else you decide to discuss -- as long as you have cams
available so you can give visual illustrations of your intentions and
interests.  PAT]

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Did you ever see me talk to myself
before like this? Instead of a harsh warning to evict the no-good
useless members of this list, I decided in the spirit of Xmas to try

bounce the offenders and wash their hands of it; I need all the readers

Subject: Last Laugh! A Lesson in Modern Electronics


Pat:

I figure you're well aware of this, but it wasn't mentioned in the
recent discussion about telephone ring circuits and grounding -- maybe
you need a trigger to publish it again.  According to Google, it's on
the web at various places, one being:

  Subject: A lesson in modern electronics


This story was related by Pat Routledge of Winnipeg, Ontario about a
repair call he handled while living in England.

It's common practice in England to ring a telephone by signaling extra
voltage across one side of the two wire circuit and ground (earth in
England).  When the subscriber answers the phone, it switches to the
two wire circuit for the conversation.  This method allows two parties
on the same line to be signaled without disturbing each other.

Anyway, an elderly lady with several pets called to say that her
telephone failed to ring when her friends called; and that on the few
occasions when it did ring her dog always barked first.  Pat proceeded
to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog.

He climbed a nearby telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed
the subscriber's house.  The phone didn't ring.  He tried again.  The
dog barked loudly, followed by a ringing telephone. Climbing down from
the pole, Pat found:

a. A dog was tied to the telephone system's ground post via an iron chain
   and collar.

b. The dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current.

c. After several such jolts, the dog would start barking and urinating on
   the ground.

d. The wet ground now completed the circuit and the phone would ring.

Which shows that you that some problems can be fixed by just pissing
on them.

  --- end ---

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: This *old* story was first printed here
in the Digest back about 1983 or so ... then a few more times over the
years until around 1990 or so when I retired it from use for what I 
felt were good reasons:  

(a)  I did not -- still don't -- think it is funny. It sounds 'cute',
     but really isn't.

(b)  It is cruel to keep animals chained up all the time. Animals do
     need to make some compromises with their human custodians, for
     example being spayed or neutered, and shortly after those medical
     procedures are finished, they don't miss those 'parts' anyway.

(c)  I've seen too many examples of animals being tortured on purpose
     or by omission, left tied up in a cold, wet, or very hot area
     with little or nothing to eat or drink. About fifteen years ago
     I found a grown dog, mostly skin and bones, who had been tied up
     in a mostly deserted basement with no food and very little water
     left for it. After I got over the shock of seeing that, I immediatly
     called the animal control officer who came out and took the
     little guy away, to the Animal Society in Chicago. Some people
     should not be allowed to have animals, if they do not know how to
     care for them. When animal control took the chain 'leash' off the
     dog, the animal immediatly licked our hands trying to say how 
     glad he was to be resuced. 

Aljian/humorphile probably got this from an old issue of the Digest,
and they are welcome to it.   PAT]

Subject: Bush Administration to Propose System to Monitor Internet


By JOHN MARKOFF and JOHN SCHWARTZ

The Bush administration is planning to propose requiring Internet
service providers to help build a centralized system to enable broad
monitoring of the Internet and, potentially, surveillance of its
users.

The proposal is part of a final version of a report, "The National
Strategy to Secure Cyberspace," set for release early next year,
according to several people who have been briefed on the report. It is
a component of the effort to increase national security after the
Sept. 11 attacks.

The President's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board is preparing
the report, and it is intended to create public and private
cooperation to regulate and defend the national computer networks, not
only from everyday hazards like viruses but also from terrorist
attack. Ultimately the report is intended to provide an Internet
strategy for the new Department of Homeland Security.

Such a proposal, which would be subject to Congressional and
regulatory approval, would be a technical challenge because the
Internet has thousands of independent service providers, from garage
operations to giant corporations like American Online, AT&T, Microsoft
and Worldcom.

The report does not detail specific operational requirements,
locations for the centralized system or costs, people who were briefed
on the document said.

Subject: What Do Intellectual Property Owners Want?


by Andy Oram
American Reporter Correspondent

CAMBRIDGE, MASS.-Researchers around the world were stunned. A
promising young graduate student, Dmitri Sklyarov, came to the United
States to deliver his insights about weaknesses in a commercial
product to a well-known computing conference. A few hours after his
presentation, he was in jail.

I don't want to belabor this case because it has already been aired in
the press a great deal, particularly since last Tuesday's startling
ruling in favor of the Sklyarov's employer, ElcomSoft, by a jury that
was clearly repulsed by the idea of punishing people who make software
with legitimate uses.

But Sklyarov and ElcomSoft start off this article because his arrest
marked a milestone in modern life-a fulfillment of the old prediction
that computer hackers used to utter as a joke: "Write a program, go to
jail." It's still scandalous that Sklyarov spent time in jail for his
non-crime.

Sklyarov suffered all this for working on a software product that was
perfectly legal in his own country, Russia, but was called a violation
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the United States. This
software allowed people using the popular Adobe eBook software-so long
as they had a legitimate license to the software-to make copies of
documents. The Russian software had many legitimate applications under
the "fair use" doctrine, but could also be used to make unauthorized
copies-and that brought down the vindictive hand of the U.S. Justice
Department, which insisted on bringing the case to trial even after
Adobe dropped their charges.

Nor was Sklyarov alone. A fifteen-year-old Norwegian, Jon Johansen,
was briefly arrested on flimsy charges related to his supposed role in
creating DeCSS software, a program that retrieves movies from their
encrypted format on DVD. Johansen's case was in court last week, but I
have not heard any news of the outcome. Many others have been sued for
similar causes, although they have not faced criminal proceedings.

Subject: Mass. Officials set rules for state's no-call list


By Associated Press, 12/20/2002

State consumer officials announced details yesterday about what steps
residents will have to take to sign on to Massachusetts' new 'Do Not
Call' law beginning Jan. 1.

Residents who want to block most calls from telemarketers will be able
to sign up on a Web site, call a toll-free number, or submit a request
by mail.

Those who want to be included on the first list, which will go into
effect April 1, must register by March 1. The list will be updated
every quarter.

The state Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation expects
to handle up to 1 million registrations in the first month, according
to its director, Jennifer Davis Carey.

Subject: Bay State Residents in January can Register to Block Sales Calls


By Bruce Mohl, Globe Staff, 12/20/2002

Massachusetts consumers seeking to block unwanted telemarketing calls 
suddenly have a lot more ammunition at their disposal.

State officials yesterday detailed how Massachusetts residents can
sign up for a do-not-call list starting Jan. 1, a day after the
Federal Trade Commission announced plans to launch a similar national
list in the spring.

By signing up for both lists, state and federal officials say
consumers should be able to significantly reduce -- but not eliminate --
the number of telemarketing calls they receive at home.  Massachusetts
officials expect a huge response.

I don't know anything about them, but I think the old adage applies:
if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.  They need to make
money somehow, and since they spammed you in the first place that
seems like an important part of their business model.

A new adage probably also applies: don't ever respond to spammers.
BTW, I'll bet if you check your spam bucket, you'll find multiple
instances of the mail, despite the fact that it says it's a one-time
mailing.

Indeed. I found the names and numbers of all the folks I talked to in 
setting up our 900-number trunks, but NONE of them are still there! In 
fact, most of the contact numbers are now out of service. 

But still ... if you press the issue, you can finally end up talking to 
someone in a given company's 900 division. For instance, call any SBC 
business office and ask for the number of the "976/900 department" for 
the area in which you are interested.

I have some qualifying questions for you:

1. What is the nature of your service? (Recorded information, live 
assistance, etc.)?

2. What sort of call volume do you expect?

3. What is the geographical scope of your audience?

4. What is the magnitude of the charging you expect to impose?

5. How do you intend to advertise? (Media, number in instruction manual, 
etc.)

6. Where (what city) do you intend to physically house the equipment?

Answers to those questions would go a long way toward being able to
make some really concrete suggestions regarding your ultimate service
provider choice and whether you would be a candidate for station-side
or trunk-side connections.

If you feel inclined to answer these questions, please do so in email.

Because of the way that SBC Ameritech has ignored me I have now made

SBC Ameritech's Revenue ... with this lost revenue I intend to finally

I offer all Americans the chance to start a Revolution ... there are
many others who have been wronged by Verizon, Southbell, Pacificbell SBC
and Ameritech.  Now I can show you how to get paid, save your
customers $$$ and get even at the same time.

Now all Ameritech customers are eligible to become my customer. And
since my service is cheaper and has more benefits it will be no
problem to get people to try it for Free.

We certainly do get incoming CLID for foreign countries. I get France,

As for your box, it wouldn't be that hard to build, but because Caller
ID information is so easy to spoof it wouldn't offer much security.

I can call you 'from' anyone or any country, and if you trust that

Another use for groundstart lines I have seen is as a cheap ACD for
Telethon rooms. (i.e. Jerry Lewis). You just order a bunch of
groundstart lines in circular hunt and hook them up to 500 sets.

The operators will never get a dial tone, and on some C.O switches you
can just stay off hook after the caller hangs up. You'll hear a clunk
and the next caller will be there.

I know Henry Cabot III used to do this in the 70's with an AE880
speakerphone on his desk. He would just leave it "off hook."

I would call the number, hear a clunk and I could yell to him wherever
he might be in the office and he could yell back. No doubt, a very
crude form of off-hook call announce -- it worked well though, and it
didn't require a PBX!

* Hollywood Loses Again in ReplayTV Case
Electronic Frontier Foundation Wins Access to Lawsuit Docs

Los Angeles - Another federal judge affirmed the right of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to represent ReplayTV owners in
their lawsuit against 28 motion picture and television industry
companies.

Craig Newmark of craigslist.org and four other ReplayTV customers are
suing the entertainment companies to clarify their rights to record
television programs and to skip commercials using digital video
recorders (DVRs). Hollywood representatives have publicly stated that
skipping commercials is "stealing."

The ReplayTV customers are represented by EFF attorneys and Ira
Rothken of the Rothken Law Firm.

The entertainment companies have tried repeatedly to prevent EFF
attorneys from accessing documents that the court ordered the
companies to produce as part of the legal discovery process. EFF
attorneys sought access because they believe these documents are
critical to preparing the ReplayTV owners' case. The entertainment
companies claimed that EFF is a "competitor" with Hollywood because of
its public statements about copyright law policy. The ruling sought by
the entertainment companies would have effectively disqualified EFF
attorneys as legal counsel for the ReplayTV owners in this case.

In October, Magistrate Judge Eick ruled in favor of EFF pointing out
that the restriction sought "would impair significantly the
prosecution of the Newmark Plaintiffs' claims by effectively
preventing attorneys from the Electronic Frontier Foundation from
serving as litigation counsel for the Newmark Plaintiffs" and found
that the entertainment companies "have failed to demonstrate a
sufficiently significant disclosure-related risk or danger" from
disclosure of their confidential information by EFF attorneys to
justify complete denial of access.

The entertainment companies appealed this decision and U.S. District
Court Judge Cooper reaffirmed today the earlier ruling in favor of EFF
commenting in a written opinion that: "The Court finds factual support
in the record to support the conclusion that EFF attorneys would be
precluded from viewing a number of documents that are relevant to the
Newmark Plaintiffs' contention that their uses of the RePlayTV DVRs
constitute fair use of the Entertainment Companies' copyrighted
works."

"We are pleased that the courts have twice recognized the importance
of access to discovery documents in the ReplayTV case," said EFF
Intellectual Property Attorney Gwen Hinze. "EFF is now committed to
protecting the fair use rights of ReplayTV owners as this case moves
forward."

"Public interest litigation and public advocacy groups like EFF can
now breath a sigh of relief," added EFF Legal Director Cindy Cohn.
"The entertainment companies were unable to set a precedent for
pushing us out of cases litigated in the public interest simply for
expressing our views on other matters."

*Jury Acquits Elcomsoft in eBook Copyright Case

Dmitry Sklyarov Odyssey Leaves Prosecutor Empty-Handed

San Francisco - The highly publicized case that began with the arrest
of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov this week came to a close. A
federal jury in San Jose recently returned a verdict of not guilty on
all counts in the criminal trial of Sklyarov's employer, a Russian
software company called Elcomsoft Ltd. The case was the one of the
first criminal cases to be brought under the Digital Millennium
Copyright Act of 1998 ("DMCA").

"Today's jury verdict sends a strong message to federal prosecutors
who believe that tool makers should be thrown in jail just because a
copyright owner doesn't like the tools they build," said EFF Senior
Intellectual Property Attorney Fred von Lohmann. "We have said from
the beginning that Dmitry Sklyarov, Elcomsoft, and technologists like
them are not pirates, and today a jury agreed."

The case began in July 16, 2001, when the FBI arrested Dmitry Sklyarov
at the Defcon conference in Las Vegas. Sklyarov was the lead engineer
on an Elcomsoft product known as the Advanced eBook Processor (AEBPR),
which software giant Adobe Systems Inc. claimed was a "circumvention
tool" prohibited by the DMCA.

* Electronic Frontier Foundation Seeks Consumer Rights

Urges Copyright Office to OK Consumer Uses of CDs and DVDs

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) today urged
the Librarian of Congress (LoC) to recognize the rights of consumers
to skip past commercials on DVDs, view DVDs sold only outside the
U.S., and play copy-protected CDs on the players of their choice.

EFF has long sought exemptions from the Digital Millennium Copyright
Act's (DMCA) prohibition on bypassing technological protections used
to limit consumer use of DVDs and copy-protected CDs.

Public-interest advocacy organization Public Knowledge joined EFF in
filing the comments to the LoC, prepared with the assistance of law
students at the Glushko-Samuelson Intellectual Property Clinic of
Washington College of Law.

EFF asked the LoC to create DMCA exemptions for four types of digital
media:

1) music on copy-protected CDs;

2) movies on DVDs whose region coding restrictions prevent playback on
U.S. players;

3) movies on DVDs which prevent skipping of commercials;

4) movies in the public domain released on DVD;

If granted, these exemptions will allow consumers to make full use of
the music and movies that they've lawfully obtained.

The entertainment industry encodes DVDs by region sold in an attempt
to control release and pricing of movies sold worldwide. Region 1
includes the United States.

"Many great films are available only outside the U.S.," said EFF Staff
Attorney Gwen Hinze. "We urge the LoC to allow film buffs to play
movies they've legitimately purchased outside the U.S. without fear of
breaking the law."

The recent distribution of "copy-protected" CDs has made some CDs
unplayable on PCs and DVD players. "The music industry intends to stop
copying, but the copy-protected CDs they sell are completely
unplayable in many PCs and newer disc players," said EFF Senior
Intellectual Property Attorney Fred von Lohmann. "When I buy a CD, I
should at least be able to play it on my CD players."

The LoC has called for comments as part of a triennial process of
granting exemptions to the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA.
Legislators charged the LoC and the U.S. Copyright Office with
reviewing the effect of the anti-circumvention provisions on the
public's ability to make non-infringing uses of copyrighted works
secured by digital protection technologies.

This rulemaking procedure allows the LoC and the Copyright Office to
grant limited three-year exemptions to the DMCA's blanket prohibition
on bypassing technological protection measures. In that way, users
could access particular classes of copyrighted works that are
protected by digital protection mechanisms.

Subject: Providing DSL Service Without Any POTS?
Date: Sat, 21 Dec 2002 01:26:57 -0700
Organization: http://extra.newsguy.com


Would it be reasonable to have the PUCs require the RBOCs to provide
DSL service to their customers without having POTS on the line? This
would be good for cutsomers who had cellphone service and didn't
really need an voice line into the house.

Don't the cable services offer POTS and cable modem internet access as
separate items?

Have there been any initiatives to create this class of service? It
would seem that it would be beneficial for the cell phone companies to
lobby for this ...

In my recent message about the creation of the Internet by the
conversion of the ARPAnet from NCP to TCP/IP, I incorrectly named Vint
Cerf as the Responsible Parent at ARPA.  Actually, the Responsible
Parent at ARPA during conversion was Bob Kahn; Vint had left ARPA for
MCI before that date.

Cerf and Stanford graduate students Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine
published the first technical specification of TCP/IP as an Internet
Experiment Note (IEN) as RFC 675, in December, 1974. Their design
included a 32 bit IP address, with eight bits for identification of a
network, and 24 bits for identification of a computer, which provided
support for up to 256 networks, each with up to 16,777,216 unique

Subject: Web Security Plan Won't Invade Privacy - White House


    By Andy Sullivan

    WASHINGTON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - Efforts to bolster Internet
security will not lead to increased government scrutiny of
individuals' online habits, the White House and industry sources said
on Friday.

    As it finalizes sweeping guidelines that aim to increase
cybersecurity, the Bush administration said individual privacy would
not be affected by efforts to prevent cyberattacks.

    "The administration is not considering a proposal to monitor what
individuals do on the Internet," a spokesman for the transition to the
newly created Department of Homeland Security said.

    High-tech companies, meanwhile, said they would resist government
efforts to get involved in the day-to-day operation of the global
computer network.

    In a set of preliminary guidelines released in September, the
White House said high-tech companies that keep an eye on the Internet
should combine their efforts and work with the government to better
defend against computer viruses, worms and other cyberattacks.

    The New York Times in its Friday edition reported the White House
is planning a bigger government role in the proposed center that could
possibly lead to surveillance of individual users.

Subject: Some Companies Will Release Customer Records on Request


By JOHN SCHWARTZ

Nearly a quarter of the corporate security officers in a survey to be
released today said they would supply information about customers to
law enforcement officials and government agencies without a court
order. If an investigation concerned national security, the figure
jumps to 41 percent.

"If you're a customer in somebody's database, you cannot be completely
confident that the information you've provided - whatever the business
might be - is not going to be shared with law enforcement agencies in
the course of their investigations," said Lew McCreary, the editor of
CSO magazine, which conducted the survey.

In the survey of 797 chief security officers (a title commonly
abbreviated as C.S.O.) 43 percent said they would require a court
order before providing information on customers, employees or partner
organizations.

The security officers who took part in the survey work in financial, 
retail, health care and many other fields, and the companies they 
work for range in size from fewer than 500 employees to more than 
30,000.

The survey questions do not give a sense of what information might be 
shared or under what circumstances. The results will provide further 
fuel for the controversy surrounding issues of privacy and national 
security since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

This can be done pretty easily. The term you want to search for on
Google is "FSK" or "FSK Signaling." You'll find quite a bit of
literature.

A number of manufacturers offer test boxes which simulate a Central
Office and provide Dial Tone, Ring Tone, Busy, AND send Caller ID they
can be had for under $1000.00.

See Here:

chipsets that support this.

Even if the caller ID is accurate, it would still be difficult to use
for blocking a given country, because in the US we often get the
caller ID with no indication that it's an international number. I got
a call from a Swiss cellphone that showed up as 417-xxx-xxxx-x. If the
digit count weren't off, I'd have no way to know it wasn't a call from
Missouri.

I can remember when there were still SxS (Step) central offices in New
Orleans back in the 1970's and even into the 1980's, and also back
then all payphones were still coin-first, ground-start (and telco
ONLY, South Central Bell, this was before Greene and COCOT-sleaze!),
if I were at a payphone (in a Step office) and was expecting someone
to call me back (I had called them, they were in the middle of
something else, such as maybe another call, if THEY were in a 1AESS
office with Call Waiting) ... I could stay "off-hook" without having
put a nickel (it eventually went up to dime in Louisiana starting in
1979), and since it was ground-start (coin-first) I would 'hear' some
form of battery hum, but no dialtone nor sidetone.

When that person called me back, once the connecter switch in my Step
central office was "pulsed over" to my payphone's final digit, they
would just "klunk in" to me, offhook! I would have full battery and
sidetone, both me and the party calling me back would just "be there,
connected to each other" ... without any "ringing"!

I assume for the other (non-coin) uses of ground-start lines, such as
the speakerphone mentioned above, that if you needed to make an
outgoing call, there could be a "grounding button" to complete a
"ground" back to the central office and thus get a dialtone to place
the call.

I never remember trying to stay off hook on a coin-first ground-start
payphone in a #5 Crossbar office, to see if I could get an incoming
call to just "klunk in". I know that it did _NOT_ work if I stayed
offhook at a ground-start coin-first payphone in a 1AESS office
though.

New Orleans Metro began to convert to Loop-Start Dial-Tone-First
(telco) payphones beginning in December 1984, and continuing
(office-by-office) until Spring 1985. And different local area
jurisdictions began introducing 911 in Summer 1985. This was the
stated reason for converting all (telco) payphones to DTF
(Loop-Start). And except for the tiny CDO (Community Dial Office) Step
offices in the outlying "exurbs", the last few "city" SxS offices in
the New Orleans metro area were cut to 1AESS by 1983, probably just
"in time" for divestiture. The remaining CDO Step offices in the
"exurbs" were converted to digital remotes during 1990.  But even
those small "exurb" CDO offices had (telco) dial-tone-first
c.o.switch-controlled payphones (AND DTMF/touchtone), beginning in the
mid-1980's, by putting some kind of dialed-digit-registers/
pre-translation/ tone-to-pulse conversion circuit packs, between the
line-finderes and the first-selector switches.

Wow, I've never met anyone with phrase dyslexia before - who the hell
is SouthBell anyway?  I've never heard of such a company :D

And seeing as you're going with the pre-SBC-conglomeration RBOCs, I
love how you've also conveniently left out Southwestern Bell, Qwest,
and SNET...

Your plan, which involves switching to an alternate local service
provider, is rather flawed, seeing as you're buying Ameritech's
service resold under a different name. Unless, of course, your Excel
telco (which, for supposedly being the nation's largest privately held
telco, I've never heard of) has somehow colocated a DMS100/5ESS at
every one of Ameritech's COs ...

And my god, I should whack you over the head with books about the

 It shows you that the company that I can give customers service from
is BETTER than all other companies researched... and get paid to do
it....

what about Money Magazine??
    Money Magazine stated: "Excel Communications is as good an example
of entrepreneurship the world will ever see."

The Secretary of State of South Carolina, Jim Miles, as quoted in
Success Magazine: "I believe that this is the finest financial
opportunity that you will ever have in your lifetime. If you do this,
you will never have to have a job job in your whole life."  He was

I can see why you may have had this attitude towards me..I also have
been [red button BEEP!] hard by ameritech...They tried to ruin my
credit, harass me, and send me annoying letters...and they still say I
owe them $$$, and I fully intend to pay them with their own lost
revenue...

if I was looking at it from your perspective and someone was sayin
they got [BEEP!]  but can make money [BEEP!] them over I might think
that you were making up your story...so I ask you, ameritech got you
that sour?? and if they do they join my amassing army against
Ameritech...

soon I will have the bill scanned so you all can see how Ameritech
thinks
$99modem + $49.99 =275 and then some how it became a magic $488
thats some Fuzzy math

I called those [BEEP!] and they hung up on me...5 times
I even talked to a rep for 5 minutes,I explained everything, she goes
hold on let me check.....click.. that [BEEP!]...

They would NOT tell me where there DSL office was in Milwaukee so I
could go and talk to somebody that cant [BEEP!] hang up on me he would
probably try to run away.

So here I am
Mad as hell 
And I, not You, am doing something about it 
and soon you will all see
I am not full of [BEEP!]

pretty sure that you could get at least one at a time over a regular
T1.

I suppose the confusion could be related to the ability to get BOTH at
the same time, and that you need the out of band signaling of a PRI
D-channel to get both.

I'm so confused ... and I haven't even asked about the real differece
between DID and DNIS or ANI and Caller ID...Maybe some one could
reccomend a good resource for these questions that is more than just a
definition but also does not need an EE degree to understand.

Thanks in advance.  Happy Holidays ...

Subject: Going Electronic, Denver Reveals Long-Term Surveillance


By FORD FESSENDEN with MICHAEL MOSS

DENVER, Dec. 14 - The Denver police have gathered information on
unsuspecting local activists since the 1950's, secretly storing what
they learned on simple index cards in a huge cabinet at police
headquarters.

When the cabinet filled up recently, the police thought they had an 
easy solution. For $45,000, they bought a powerful computer program 
from a company called Orion Scientific Systems. Information on 3,400 
people and groups was transferred to software that stores, searches 
and categorizes the data.

Then the trouble began.

After the police decided to share the fruits of their surveillance 
with another local department, someone leaked a printout to an 
activist for social justice, who made the documents public. The mayor 
started an investigation. People lined up to obtain their files. 
Among those the police spied on were nuns, advocates for American 
Indians and church organizations.

To make matters worse, the software called many of the groups 
"criminal extremists."

the Denver police got this bright idea years ago from Chicago police

Trouble makers = 'communists', 'radical blacks', 'anarchists', war-
protestors, gay guys, anyone running for political office who is not
a Chicago-style Democrat, etc. Of course drug sellers, murderers and
really sick individuals who harm any of the first several categories
above need not fear. You cannot expect the police to do everything. I

Subject: Pop-ups Add New Twist


By Stefanie Olsen
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

Pop-up advertisements, already the bane of millions of Web surfers, 
are becoming more intrusive.

Pop-up and pop-under ads open a new window when people visit many
popular Web sites, often littering the computer desktop with multiple
browser screens. Advertisers hope people will visit the promoted Web
page by clicking anywhere on the window, although many simply close it
by selecting the "X" box in the top-right corner.

But a relatively new feature may make it harder for people to avoid 
these windows. Using a technique called the "kick through," 
advertisers can direct a person to another Web site if they simply 
move their cursor across the pop-up ad -- no clicking is necessary.

Discount travel retailer Orbitz, for example, is delivering millions
of holiday-themed kick-through ads on The New York Times, ESPN.com and
CondeNast sites in addition to others. The ads feature various
animated games, and recipients who simply "mouse" over them are
shuttled to Orbitz's home page.

Many people who have encountered the ads say they overstep the
boundaries of an already intrusive and loathed form of Web
advertising.

Subject: Federal Database Spy Site Fading Away


By Declan McCullagh
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
December 20, 2002, 10:46 AM PT

Call it the incredibly shrinking government Web site.

As controversy grows over the Defense Department's shadowy Total
Information Awareness (TIA) project, the project's virtual presence is
steadily decreasing. If fully implemented, TIA would link databases
from sources such as credit card companies, medical insurers, and
motor vehicle databases for police convenience in hopes of snaring
terrorists.

First, biographical information about the TIA project leaders, 
including retired Adm. John Poindexter, disappeared from the Defense 
Department's site last month. A mirror that one activist created from 
Google's cache shows the deleted information included four resumes 
listing past work experience but no addresses or contact information.

Then, sometime in the last week, the TIA site shrank still more and 
some links ceased to work. The logo for the TIA project--a Masonic 
pyramid eyeballing the globe--vanished, a highly unusual step for a 
government agency. So did the TIA's Latin "scientia est potentia" 
slogan, which means "knowledge is power."

AFAIK the telcos already do this for other DSL providers, but you
still have to pay something per month for the pair, so the savings may
not be great.

SDSL and non-line-shared ADSL are already available, but all of the
DSL companies I've seen require a phone number to determine which CO
your DSL would be served out of.

Err, my SDSL  line from DSL.net doesn't have a POTS line associated with
it.

The phone company wants to sell DSL over POTS yes, but you should be
able to get what you want.  Hint, it isn't as cheap, it is considered
business class service.

The FCC has required the RBOCS to provide their services unbundled to
the competition, again, it is something the RBOCs are fighting tooth
and nail.

They have been spending millions lobbying against it.  SBC is paying
millions/mo in fines from the Illinois PUC, because they are not meeting
their obligations.

The phone companies are only interested in their profit. Unless this
class of service improves their bottom line they are not interested. And
DSL service cuts into their leased line business.

Subject: Critics Weigh In on Copyright Act


By Joanna Glasner

A federal agency's request for commentary on a controversial digital
copyright law drew a boatload of criticism from respondents who asked
for new limitations on the far-reaching statute.

The responses, published Friday by the U.S. Copyright Office, are the
result of a month-long inquiry concerning sections of the 1998 Digital
Millennium Copyright Act. As part of a mandate to review sections of
the statute every three years, the agency is looking into provisions
that prohibit the use of tools that undo encryption protections on
digital materials.

The copyright office said the request was intended to help determine
whether the law should make exceptions for tools that allow more
flexible use of digital files and aren't used for copyright
infringement.

Respondents, including several well-known digital rights activists, 
overwhelmingly favored carving out exceptions to the DMCA for certain 
uses of music files, text and video technologies. Many argued that 
buyers of copyrighted works should have the right to make content 
accessible on more than one device.

http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,56963,00.html


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Although the copyright people do have
a plausible argument about wanting to protect their material, it
really is rotten when guys purchase music, text or video files and
then are unable to play it when they get home from the store with it.
Or, they are able to load it and play it on one computer, but not on
their other computers, etc. Maybe the copyright people would settle
for some arrangement where files could be copied a certain number of
times on other devices (although played indefinitly on any one device)
before shutting down the copying mechanism. Motorola cell phones used
to be fixed that way:  the user of the phone could reprogram it three
times with new numbers, etc, then the phone would lock up against any
further number changes, and the 'owner' had to take the phone back to
a dealer or the company, explain himself, and get the phone unlocked
for further programming efforts. Some people knew how to clear the
counter that locked you out after three times, but not many people. 
Maybe the DMCA could operate with that principle; do what you want
with *your paid for, personally owned* copy three or four times, then
no more allowed. That would allow most guys to put their thing on
two or three different computers, etc, allow them to personally use
the copy indefinitly, but then lock out further copies.  PAT]

this: Most of the pieces of the system are already in place.

Because of the inroads the Internet and other digital network
technologies have made into everyday life over the last decade, it is
increasingly possible to amass Big Brother-like surveillance powers
through Little Brother means. The basic components include everyday
digital technologies like e-mail, online shopping and travel booking,
A.T.M. systems, cellphone networks, electronic toll-collection systems
and credit-card payment terminals.

In essence, the Pentagon's main job would be to spin strands of 
software technology that would weave these sources of data into a 
vast electronic dragnet.

Technologists say the types of computerized data sifting and pattern 
matching that might flag suspicious activities to government agencies 
and coordinate their surveillance are not much different from 
programs already in use by private companies. Such programs spot 
unusual credit card activity, for example, or let people at multiple 
locations collaborate on a project.

I am having a bit of trouble with a Northern Telecom 2500 (or rather a
we2500 as I've read they're the same thing) I just got.

The phone for the most part works fine, however when I try to use it,
the dial tone and anything else on the other end of the line is very
faint.  It's not a problem with the receiver as the Touch-tone comes
through perfectly loud and it seems to only affect incoming signals as
I've made calls with it and the person on the other end could hear me
perfectly.

Any ideas? Any help?

I'm only a beginner hobbyist so schematics are a bit to hard to read,
however I can use a multimeter and should be able to tinker with it
easily.

I've tried checking the web for info on this but it's a vast sea of
info thus it's been tough (I feel lucky to have found this
newsgroup). If you could also email me with the info, as I'm not a
regular reader of newsgroups and it's easier for me to archive the
info after the fact.

Thanks in advance.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: No guarentees, but try first swapping
out the earpiece speaker (or the entire handset receiver if you cannot
get into the earpiece itself) and see if that helps. Many times a
problem with hearing/speaking on old phones can be traced to the
speaker/microphone in the handset. PAT]

This is one of the worst spammer services around on the Internet.
Query google for them. They switched to operating from Chinanet
because they have been removed from almost every available ISP. They
are "block-on-sight" material.

There IS a benefit. 

I'm switching to Corecomm, who resells Ameritech lines in the
Cleveland area, because as a single person, if they fail to provide
service, I have little leverage. Corecomm, on the other hand, is their
largest reseller and has clout -- and having used them before I know
they will take care of me.

Aaron, however, is still a major dork and probably a scammer.

So what? SBC sucks. I'm a customer of SBC; I already know that. The
only reason I had SBC was so I could get DSL, and now that Adelphia
has broadband Internet service in my neighborhood and I may be closer
to jumping in on a Wireless ISP project I've been considering, there
is no reason to keep the DSL, and therefore no reason to keep the SBC
dialtone.

I'm not questioning the state of the industry. I figured you are lying
about *your* personal experiences. Although, I might be willing to
bend on that point, since you say you live in Milwaukee :)

Dude, I'm already in the process of switching to Corecomm. I will
*not* touch Excel. I have no incentive to, anyhow, as I am a customer
of Sprint PCS and have taken advantage of the special landline long
distance offer they have, and should have Corecomm dialtone by the end
of the year. It's resold Ameritech service, but Corecomm actually
gives a rat's patootie about service.

Pat, you mention "Family Oriented Digest" in your summation.  Is that
abbreviated FOD?

I'm kind of curious as my son is currently on a BIG gray cruise ship
(with Norwalk-like virus also) in an unnamed sea off an unnamed
country.  Their cruise ship has a built-in airport, and they get to
walk along the "runway" and pick up any trash that may damage aircraft
engines.  The type of things they are picking up and throwing away are
referred to as FOD, for Foriegn Object Damage.  We appreciate your
picking up and discarding the FOD from posters like Aaron.  Keep up
the good work!


Rodgers Platt

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Quit picking on Aaron. He means well. I
really feel alarmed for your son and his buddies on that cruise ship.
Any day now, I expect Dubya's mental illness to deteriorate, and his
Delusions of Grandeur to get to the point that we all turn into FOD. 
All except Dubya and his buddies of course; they've all had their small-
pox vaccinations. PAT]

Strangely enough, I worked for a "well reviewed" startup, too -- 6
months after our glowing reviews came out, we were gone, leaving 60
million in stranded debt, and destroying the companies and people we
had interacted with ...

Long story short, this month's swan may be next month's ugly duck.

Also, while I didn't scour the posted articles, where's the connection
to your company?  I know that the RBOCs, ILECs and established CLECs
are evil... But no where did I see Excel (or whatever you're called
again) named ...

If you express yourself as eloquently in person and on the phone as
you do here, no wonder they hang up on you.

There are processes to deal with the carriers when they're out of
line. Did you contact your PUC?  What about your elected officials?
Or did this just seem to be a good entrance into sales for you?

Generally speaking, the more someone insists they're not full of, as
Pat put it, "BEEP!" - the more "BEEP" they contain.

Also, on a personal note, the picture of you holding the world in your
hands?  Nice touch ... Makes you seem very down to earth and
approachable.

Pat, thanks for posting this up - always love a good laugh!

Subject: Microsoft Sued For Stealing Mobile Phone Secrets


    By Lucas van Grinsven

    AMSTERDAM, Dec 23 (Reuters) - British mobile phone maker Sendo
said on Monday it had filed a suit in a U.S. federal court against its
former partner Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), accusing it of stealing its
technology and customers.

    The small British cellphone maker was Microsoft's key partner in
entering the 400 million unit a year mobile phone market until the two
companies unexpectedly cut ties last month without disclosing all the
reasons why they fell out.

    The court filings allege that Microsoft, in search of new growth
markets but lacking mobile phone expertise, extracted crucial
information about the industry from Sendo and passed it on to friendly
low-cost contract manufacturers in Asia.

    Privately owned Sendo may claim several hundred million dollars in
damages, according to people familiar with the court proceedings.

We are considering replacing a Harris (Teltronics) 20-20 with an
Inter-tel Axxess solution to run a multi-site skills based call centre
with PBX functionality for each site as well as intra-site voip calls
across existing leased lines.  Does anybody have experience of this,
because the Inter-tel solution (price) seems almost too good to be
true based upon our experience with the 20-20.  I am told that
performance and capabilities of the Axxess is not on a par with the
20-20 - any comments?


Thanks,

Dave

Excel is a long distance reseller offering long distance service via
an MLM pyramid.  They're like most other MLMs in that the true
believers think they're absolutely wonderfully fantastic, and the rest
of the world wishes they'd stop bugging us with eye-glazing
opportunity spiels.

The last time I checked, their rates were mediocre, nowhere near as
good as the truly low cost providers, but no worse than the heavily
advertised ones.

I guess this is on-topic, since CDT *is* a telecomms newsgroup.

However, I'll be exceedingly skeptical unless you can show me some
firm proof that you can actually make money on Excel, and I want to
see proof that *you* personally are making money.

Excel is still an MLM.

In a recent Dilbert book, Scott Adams laments that he would dearly
love to be an NFL linebacker.  However, weighing in at 150 pounds, he
is physically unsuited for the job.  He went on to remark that,
similarly, somebody who measures their panty size by the hectare should
probably not be working in a lingerie shop.

Somebody who is trying to sell me a communication service should at
least have some mastery of the rudiments of communication, and that
starts with spelling.  This guy has about a grade-7 ability to spell
and construct sentences.  Whether it's a correct assessment or not,
this brings to mind an image of some backwards hillbilly living in a
trailer somewhere in the hills, and NOT an image of a successful sales
representative who's going to be around to (intelligently) answer my
questions when Excel starts screwing up my bill.

Sorry Aaron, but every instinct I've got tells me to run away
screaming from you and your "offer".  As for your inability to
communicate in the written medium, they're called "night classes".
Look into it.

The same thing has traditionally been true on the Internet.  But after
a few denial-of-service attacks were performed on Internet sites by
flooding them with connection requests whose originating IP address
was spoofed, most reputable ISPs have started filtering their outgoing
traffic so that no one can send a packet with a spoofed originating IP
address.  Sites that won't do this will be blacklisted and wind up
effectively cut off.

It's time for LECs to similarly block their customers with PBXes from
transmitting phony Caller ID information.  And for us to start a
blacklist of LECs that won't.

One _can_ get around that.  

It takes some persistance, but it _is_ doable.

Speaking from first-hand experience.

I'm corporate tech-support, co-ordinating a DSL install for 'work from
home' for one of our employees, who had gone cellular-only more than a
year previously.

This was several years ago, and the only offerings were 'non-shared'.

The 'initial' pre-qualification was easy -- building was a two-unit
apartment building, just used the number for the 'neighbors'.

Getting the order through to completion took some effort.

The DSL company (Covad) computers wouldn't accept the order _without_
a phone number.  When they submitted it to the ILEC (Ameritech)
*their* computers rejected it *if* it had a phone number (their system
_knew_ there was no phone service at that unit).

Eventually, persistance paid off, and Covad management figured out how
to keep all the computers happy.

The *installer* was more than a little bit puzzled, though.  His work
order showed the on-site phone number as "000-0000" <grin>

A staffer can reroute the call after picking it up, but no, I don't
think the original external caller can divert the call to a specific
extension before anyone picks up the phone, which is what I think of
as DID.  These are being used standalone, not in conjunction with any
switch or private pbx.

The Motorola data book lists the full CID specs on the data sheets
with the Motorola caller-ID chips.  It's just straight FSK on the line
between the first and second rings.

If I understand what you're saying correctly, you can hear your own
DTMF signals when you dial perfectly fine but the voice of the far-end
party is muted. If that's the case, you might try cleaning and/or
adjusting the 'normalling' contacts on the DTMF dial. Usually the
older DTMF dials would have a set of contacts that would place a low
resistance across the receiver network when a button was pressed, in
effect swamping the incoming signal, so that your dialed digits
wouldn't be painfully loud in your ear. Possibly those contacts aren't
opening when you release the buttons.

I'm not sure how you'd implement something like that, Pat, at least
with current technology.  Specifically, where does this counter get
stored?  Ideally, it would be stored on the distribution media, but
most media is read-only (ie: CD's, DVD's), so how would it (the disc)
be able to keep track of how many times it's been copied, and/or where
it's been copied, etc.?

I've heard suggestions that the program doing the copying could track
this, but really -- that's a non-starter.  If my copying software
stops allowing me to copy a particular disc, I'll just take that disc
to another machine (with another copy of the copying software
installed) that hasn't yet seen that disc.  I have six computers
running at home and have access to four more at the office -- plenty
of opportunity for some serious copyright violation.  :-)

The entertainment companies are going to have to understand (and in
fact, probably do to a large degree) that while certain schemes may
make it difficult for "average" users to copy their material, the fact
that it's DIGITAL makes it inevitable that not only will copying take
place, but that the copies will be perfect duplicates of the original.
No amount of jiggery-pokery is going to stop that - anything that can
be done in software (or hardware) can be undone by a determined
hacker.  :-)

DirecTV systems have a "smart-card" with an onboard ASIC chip that
handles all of the decryption duties - so far, the hackers haven't
found a way to software-emulate that ASIC chip.  That hasn't stopped
'em from writing completely new scripts and programming them on the
card - scripts that bypass whatever security measures DirecTV is using
this week.  A CD or a DVD doesn't have access to something even as
advanced as this -- it's just a pile of data, sitting there waiting to
be read by a laser beam.  And that's why we've got bullshit laws like
the DMCA -- we can't stop people reading the data, but let's make it
illegal to even MAKE something that could, POSSIBLY, defeat whatever
feeble copy-protection measures that were included on the disc and
thus permit duplication.

I really, really hope the DMCA goes down (or at least gets greatly
modified).  It goes WAY too far.  Under its provisions, we'd never
have had the home VCR, and IBM would still be making all of our PC's
(well, and Apple).  Hell, even Coleco would never have gotten away
with their "Colecovision Atari Emulator".  :-) In the same vein, none
of the companies that got started by making game cartridges for the
old Atari VCS would have been permitted to do so.  Companies like
Activision, for example.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: What would be wrong with the media
company (let's call them 'publishers') supplying TWO copies of the
media; the 'original' and the 'backup' copy. Do as you please ONE TIME
with the backup copy. I bought some computer software once from a 
company which did that; they gave you your copy to use, and a backup
copy at the same time. Another possibility is the publisher would
include a serial number with your purchase, and that serial number
entitled you to call their office for one, two or even three
additional copies. When you placed your order you could ask for one,
two or three copies (in which case the serial number would so indicate
that the order had been completely filled.) If I understand this
matter correctly, most guys are not interested in cheating and making
an infinite number of copies to use on the net, all their friends,
etc, they are mainly interested in being sure they themselves can use
the media as intended. Wouldn't including (or allowing for the
shipping of) two or three extra copies of the media still turn out 
less expensive for the publishers than the wholesale cheating which
is going on now?   PAT]

War now, on America's timetable, or war later, on Saddam's -- once
he's got nukes.  Take your choice.  Unless you like the idea of a
nuclear September 11th, the smart money votes "war now".

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: If those were the only two choices, I
suppose I would agree. But I am not convinced things are that cut and
dry. All Mr. Hussein is asking for is to be left alone. I mean, he has
supplied a twelve thousand page document saying they have no nuclear
devices, which is more than Yemen or North Korea can say. How many
different ways are there for him to say he does not have nuclear
weapons?  What difference does it make in practical terms if a nuclear
war starts as a result of Mr. Hussein, or the Yemen people or the
North Korea people? Thirty years ago we were absolutely convinced that
Moscow and Nikita Krucshev were the enemy. 

A couple weeks ago when the USA intercepted those scud missiles
traveling from North Korea to Yemen and the USA 'reluctantly' allowed
the shipment to continue, Mr. Hussein spoke to Fox News, PBS and the
Christian Science Monitor and asked, 'why is it that North Korea and
Yemen can have scud missles, but Dubya says I cannot have them? I have
written twelve thousand pages attempting to 'prove' what does not
exist.' And thus far, the supposedly impartial inspectors from the
United Nations (where the USA refuses to pay its dues unless/until it
gets its way) have been unable to find any signs of weapons like that
either. And they have looked everywhere, but are afraid to quit looking
because Dubya will go spastic if they do. 

Dubya, in his rationalization of his illness, insists they must be
there 'someplace' and that by God they will be found, and confiscated. 
'Confiscated' as in what happens to guns taken by police from gang 
members in Chicago, El Lay and Washington, DC. Corrupt police officers
(and which ones are not?) put the guns back on the street in the hands
of other gang members. No Joey, its not an either/or situation like
you describe. At least, I think not. PAT]

Subject: Microsoft Plans to Appeal Java Ruling


  
Sun Microsystems Inc. won a victory against the digital age
equivalent of Goliath when a judge ordered Microsoft Corp. to
clude updated Java programing language in its Windows
operating system.

Sun had argued during a three-day hearing earlier this month
that Microsoft has gained an unfair advantage by shipping
Windows _ used by more than 90 percent of the world's personal
computers _ with an outdated version of Java that's
inconsistent for its users.

U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz granted Sun a
temporary injunction Monday and said he would order Microsoft
to stop shipping the old version.

Microsoft said it will consider appealing the ruling. A
spokesman added that it was "premature" to comment on when the
latest version of Java will be included in Windows.

In asking for the injunction, Sun said that if it waited
until its $1 billion antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft was
settled, it would be too far behind to compete.

By Shari Rudavsky, Globe Correspondent, 12/22/2002

When Lauren Steinfeld attended the University of Pennsylvania, she, 
like most other college students, didn't blink when her Social 
Security number became her student ID. Now the 1989 Penn alumna 
spends her days thinking about privacy issues at the Philadelphia 
school. In January, Steinfeld, who has a law degree from New York 
University, became Penn's chief privacy officer. Although some 
schools have appointed officials to oversee compliance with new 
federal health privacy laws, Penn officials said they know of no 
other university with a post that has such a broad scope. Steinfeld 
recently spoke to the Globe about her job and its impact on higher 
education.

Subject: White House Scrambles to Defuse Privacy Concerns


By Roy Mark

The White House scrambled over the weekend to alleviate privacy
violation fears raised by its proposal to build a monitoring system as
an "early warning center" to track Internet use in the U.S. The
proposal is part of the final version of "The National Strategy to
Secure Cyberspace," expected to be released in early 2003.

According to reports last week, the Bush Administration would require
Internet service providers (ISPs) to build the system and to track
their users. Few details were released by the White House. The
proposal immediately raised concerns from privacy advocates who said
the idea may cross a line regarding current corporate and personal
privacy laws.

It's safe to assume that, before he flushed his reputation down the

He may have a clue now. Internet opinion pages like Instapundit, run
by University of Tennessee law professor Glenn Reynolds, and Talking
Points Memo, from leftie political columnist Josh Marshall -- were
among the first to latch on to ABCNews.com's brief item on Lott's
racist comments during Strom Thurmond's 100th birthday bash.

And they kept focusing on Lott's hateful past -- until the national 
press corps finally had to take notice.

Subject: U.S. Retailers Face Worst Holiday Sales in 30 Years


    By Emily Kaiser

    CHICAGO, Dec 24 (Reuters) - U.S. retailers, reeling from a
lackluster holiday season that is forecast to be the weakest in
more than 30 years, may ring in the new year with steep
markdowns on clothing, accessories -- and profit forecasts.

    Analysts cut earnings estimates for retailers ranging from
sector leader Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) to upscale jeweler
Tiffany & Co. Inc. (NYSE:TIF) on Tuesday, a day after major chain
stores reported another week of tepid sales in what was supposed
to be the biggest shopping period of the year.

    In a weekly report on Tuesday, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi
and UBS Warburg forecast holiday sales in November and December
would be up an anemic 1.5 percent over last year, the smallest
gain since the banks began tracking weekly sales in 1970.

    That's a far cry from the 4 percent rise forecast by the
National Retail Federation, although the trade group still
believes its target is reachable. The NRF looks at total holiday
sales when calculating its forecast, while others including
BTM/UBSW focus on sales only at large chains.

High speed access reaches rural Wash. via cable connections

By Eli Sanders, Globe Correspondent, 12/25/2002

EPHRATA, Wash. - On the lightly trafficked main street in this small,
rural town, one store is advertising something local residents had
never seen before: ''Internet Connections at the Speed of Light.''

The connections arrived due to an innovative program reminiscent of
the public power projects that brought electricity to much of the
West. With a nudge from federal, state, and local agencies, high speed
Internet service providers are reaching rural areas via extra space on
fiber-optic cables owned by public power providers. Bob Lahmann, a
transmission account executive at the Bonneville Power Administration,
said that bringing broadband to the hinterlands seemed like a natural
for the federally chartered agency.

Subject: Verizon Blames Layoffs in Western New York on Loss of Business


Dec. 20 -- Oil embargoes, wars, stagflation -- workers for New York's
local telephone company weathered all kinds of economic storms without
a layoff.  Until Thursday morning, when decades of job security ended.
About 180 workers throughout Western New York received pink-slips from
Verizon, most of them repair and maintenance staff.  The layoffs, part
of a 2,400 cutback statewide, were the first for blue-collar phone
workers since World War II, perhaps even before that, company and
union officials said.  

"This is the first (layoff) since we were NYNEX, Bell Atlantic and New
York Telephone," said Mary Jo Arcuri, business manager of
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 2213.  The rare
action underscores the changes sweeping the telephone industry.  Under
the 1996 Telecommunications Act, competitors are beginning to offer an
alternative to the century-old Bell monopoly.

Technological solutions to sociological problems never work.  For one
thing, there's always the "analog hole" which allows complete
circumvention of any copyright scheme.  And people will always find
ways to really beat the copy protection scheme -- especially when
digital media are involved, allowing software analysis and
manipulation.

But there is the larger question of what you're buying when you buy a
published work such as a musical recording or book.  By historical
practice and common agreement, you generally are purchasing a
transferrable perpetual license for the personal enjoyment of that
work.

For example, most people -- and the courts -- agree that if I bought
an LP back in 1971, I have the right to copy that to MP3 so that I can
listen to it today on my computer, and to an iPod, or a CD for my car
CD player.  I can copy it to my MP3 player on Thursdays and my iPod on
Wednesdays ... Hardware copy-protection schemes won't allow that.

I don't have or claim the right to publish it on the Internet or give
it away (unless its copyright has expired and it's moved into the
public domain -- alas nowawadays copyright protection is almost
perpetual).

But by way of preventing theft, the RIAA is going to make their
digital publications worth far less.  By analogy, most people will pay
$20 for a hardcover book that they read once and leave on the shelf
forever; how much would they pay if that book self-destructed after
that first reading, or if it worked only on that ancient computer that
you discarded many years ago?  We shall see how much people will be
willing to pay for highly restricted media licenses.

That's an interesting idea, but if they are sending incorrect CLID info,

The fundamental problem here, and one that's going to require far more
deep thought than just "give people an extra copy", is that media
companies' business model relies on scarcity.  Companies exclusively
market works by particular artists, sell higher-priced "limited
edition" works with often negligible added value, sell releases for a
limited time, etc., and control pricing by means of this scarcity.
And ultimately, works become unavailable when they stop being
profitable.

Today, however, with the easy ability for anyone to copy a recording
with a computer and distribute it without limit, there *is* no
scarcity.  "Limited edition" works are non-existent.  Packaging is
non-existent.  Costs for reproduction and distribution are
non-existent.  Costs for archiving old works are negligible, so things
need never go "out of print".  There's no reason for customers to ever
have to tolerate being told that "that item is no longer available,"
or to find it reasonable to pay high prices to subsidize an
unnecessary manufacturing, warehousing, distribution, and retail
network.

How can media companies survive in this new economic reality?  I don't
have all the answers, but I'm sure it boils down to the same rule that
has always led to successful businesses..."give your customers what
they want at a fair price."  That's not what the entertainment
industry is doing now.  Instead, their attitude is "your customers
will rob you blind if you let them, so treat them like criminals and
try to control everything they do with your product even after you've
got their money."

Why not take your entire back catalog of stuff you're not selling
anymore, put it online, and allow people to download entire albums for
a buck, with no restrictions on what they may do with them?  Price it
so that it's enough to cover your costs and make some profit (which
shouldn't be hard, since you're not making any money off it now), but
cheap enough that people aren't tempted to pirate the content.  Then
take the billions you're saving in research costs trying to implement
digital restrictions on your content, and use it to foster better
relationships with your customers?

Let me guess ... Javascript and yet another reason to turn it off.
Here's my checklist for installing a web browser (or using a
pre-installed browser the first time) ...

   1) *PHYSICALLY* disconnect your machine from the internet.  I.e. on
      a LAN or ADSL or cable unplug the ethernet, and on a dialup unplug
      the modem line.
   2) Start up the browser.
   3) Set startup page to "blank".
   4) Turn off cookies.
   5) Turn off Java.
   6) Turn off Javascript ("Scripting" in MS IE.  Note that MS IE has
      several entries for different kinds of scripting.  Turn off each
      and every one).

*if* your cookies are mangled or missing or your browser begins

what they require if you *really* want to see the site. But many of
them -- including the bank I use, refuse to say what is wrong, you
just get the login screen back; your first inclination is that maybe
you entered your password wrong. Even Yahoo waits until after you have
tried three times to login to come back with the message 'your browser
is refusing to accept our cookies' as their reasoning. After awhile
you get tired of seeing those things and just start leaving everything
wide open and using a laundry program each time you login/logout as

The difference is how each would be likely to use nuclear weapons;

destroy Israel and make himself emperor of the Middle East.

Spastic?  I have a very hard time that President Bush would exhibit
such behavior, or that *any President in reasonably recent history*

Subject: My New Spy Cam Software and Web Page


In view of all the folks who are getting into web cams these days, I
decided to try it for myself. I've seen web site advertisements for
porno web pages where there were 'secret' cams hidden away in shower
rooms, dormitory rooms, etc. I thought that would be fun, so I have
installed a web cam in my computer room, and all of you get to try it
out ... 'to check out my cam' as the guys say on Yahooo Messenger.

If you would like to look at this cam during its beta testing stage
before I put it in full time service on http://weatherforecast.n3.net
you may do so by looking at the temporary page I have established for
testing purposes only: http://patrick-townson.n3.net

I can't tell you what you are likely to see from one minute to the
next.  I have a little script which constantly pushes via FTP the
pictures to the server; you then get the pics at the above address. I
use a javascript to refresh the pictures every few seconds, just like
they do on those secret cams hidden away in dormitory rooms, and men's
locker rooms, etc.

It seems to work best if you use Internet Explorer with Javascript
enabled, but other browsers work okay, like Netscape and Opera, but if
they do not update the picture every few seconds then you need to
refresh the picture manually. Since it changes every few seconds, a
digital clock on the screen identifies each picture as it is posted.
I would appreciate feedback from those guys  who watch what I do here
in my house all day and night. I'll leave that page up a couple days
or so; it really is eating up the CPUs. http://patrick-townson.n3.net

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: And the same to you, Bob, and the rest

white Christmas would be an understatement. How's twelve inches of
blowing, drifting snow sound to you? It began snowing around 10 AM on
Monday morning as had been predicted, and continued all day and into
the night. I was very smart, and following my Salvation Army duties
on Monday went into Marvin's and stocked up on groceries. After almost 
24 hours, it stopped snowing early Tuesday (Christmas Eve) morning. 
Marvins was absolutely swamped with shoppers Monday night and early
Tuesday; so was Walmart. Sometime mid-morning Tuesday the snow plows
started cleaning the main streets which are pretty well cleared by
now (late Wednesday) and I am told they are starting on the smaller
residential streets now. About an hour ago (11 PM Wednesday night) the
snow plow went past my house. By the weekend I suspect the streets
will be passable once again. Until then, I think I will stay here in
my house next to the fireplace with a glass of bourbon and water.
Anyway, happy holidays to one and all. PAT]

A customer-end switch which is connected by an ISDN protocol, such as
Q931 or your local flavour or variant, can reject a call on presentation.
Mine is set to do that to certain types of telemarketer (no, I will not
go into more details than that!) - however a POTS (analog) connected
customer is SOL here.

A network switch -- i.e. within a Telco's curtilege -- should be
capable of rejecting calls where the presented Caller-ID is within a
specified set of ranges.  In many cases it would do that using CCITT
Signalling System 7.  Actually implementing this is completely
impractical; many calls travel around networks with invalid caller-ID:
which the person receiving the call never sees as it's marked
"unavailable" or similar.  A string of all zeroes is quite common,
particularly on international calls, as the various discount providers
do not want any receiving or tandem telcos in the path to know how the
call was routed -- in case THEY were to decide to block that traffic
for "commercial" reasons.

The only way these calls can be blocked is by the *originating* Telco
who would need to ensure any customer-sent Caller-ID was included in
the "Call-Detail-Record" (CDR) that switches produce, and matching the
details offline against the originating *port*: this would allow them
to disconnect customers that continued to send forged Caller-ID after
they had been given suitable warning.  (Online-checking in the switch
is impractical, due mainly to the high cost of the software upgrades
that woud be needed for the switch to do that).

Now we can, of course, all visualise local telcos doing this?  Turning
OFF what are likely to be their most profitable customers?  That's as
likely as Worldcom/UUNet taking any action against their spammers ...
nobody in Telco-land is going to voluntarily throw away a customer,
particularly given the financial state of the telco industry today!

Nor -- in most cases -- will it be possible for transit and
terminating Telcos to drop calls from the rogue telcos: they cannot
use Caller-ID to block calls precisely because it is forged, and
therefore cannot be trusted ... and they cannot disconnect individual
pipes because they have interconnect contracts which specify they must
"Connect and Keep Connected" the links betwen them -- so cutting off a
rogue network is likely to lead to litigation ... there typically
being nothing in the average interconnect contract which requires
Telco to validate any Caller-ID information provided and sent forward.

Yet this same forged Caller-ID will likely ALSO be that delivered up
when the Department of Homeland Security comes asking questions about
the origin of particular calls made to their terrorist suspects: and
when that information is needed urgently to prevent another terrorist
attack (say, from Iraqi or Al-Qaeda sympathisers) will NOT the best
time to find out that Telcos have been turning a blind eye to forged
Caller-ID!

[TELECOM Digest Editor Noted:

>  ... I guess the only way it would work would be if someone got

> calls from the blacklisted number.

But they would then be blacklisting a forged number -- most likely
the valid number of a different customer -- and Caller-ID forgers
could easily use a "tumbler" system to send a DIFFERENT Caller-ID
on every call.  That's what the spammers do with their spam, and
we all know we can't block spam by the sender's name, don't we?

> It would be hard to keep it all straight however.   PAT]

Too right it would!

It is my impression that CO phone switches can be programmed to know
the valid CLID number range for a PBX, and to substitute in the main
number if a call from the PBX has no CLID or CLID outside that range.
Too bad telcos are almost all too lazy to do so.

This is actually an option in the Nortel C.O. Switches, you can
restrict a PRI Customer to sending only the numbers they control -- a
DID block for example.

However, considering the skill of some of the staff I have encountered
of late at our new mega telcos (i.e. Verizon) where I have had to
describe -- this to a network "engineer":

a) How PRI DID trunks CAN make outgoing calls.
b) The concept of SS7

 ... not to mention the hell I've gone through trying to fix some
incorrect CNAM (Caller ID Name) listings in a block of 500 DIDs ... I
said not to mention.

I doubt it will ever happen in our lifetime.

But maybe ... hey, if I set up a 900 calling card type service where a
caller could enter the number they're calling to AND FROM, would I be
breaking any laws? How long before I got shut down by the FCC or
killed by my provider?

 ... of course this would be for amusement purposes only.

Might be a fun project, just to prove a point. Might even make some
cash before I was arrested -- enough to pay my lawyers.

Subject: Phone Calls on the Cable Bill


By WILL WADE

ALL Peter Odabashian wanted was a second phone line. But when the
phone company said it needed to run new wiring into his apartment,
which would cost nearly $300 and require waiting several weeks, he
found an alternative: the cable company.

Mr. Odabashian turned to the RCN Corporation, a cable company that 
offers telephone service as well as "The West Wing" and "The 
Sopranos." "RCN said it would install the line for free and throw in 
a month of service," said Mr. Odabashian, a film editor in New York 
who previously had cable service from Time Warner. "I signed up for 
the full works. Now I have two phone lines, TV and a cable modem from 
them."

Mr. Odabashian is one of a growing number of consumers who receive 
telephone service from a cable company instead of a telephone 
carrier. Faced with the increasing success of satellite television, 
cable companies are moving to retain customers by offering services 
that satellite companies cannot match. Phone traffic is part of that 
strategy.

Cable companies have spent millions in recent years to upgrade 
equipment to carry digital television and two-way Internet traffic. 
Adding a third information stream, voice, is not difficult. Not only 
does this reduce defections to satellite services, it also generates 
a new source of income. The cable industry's long-term goal is to 
deliver digital television, high-speed Internet access through cable 
modems, and telephone service; insiders call it the triple play.

Subject: Now Your Cellphone Can Remember Mom's Birthday


By JOE HUTSKO

HAVING all your contacts and appointments at hand is one of the most
convenient things about owning a hand-held organizer, and
synchronizing makes it easy to keep both the hand-held and your big
computer up to date. Press a button, and everything on the big
computer transfers to the pocket-size one. Add or change things on the
hand-held, and the next sync transmits the changes back to the mother
ship.

Millions of cellphone owners, on the other hand, tend to punch those
same names and numbers by hand into the phone rather than transferring
existing entries from a personal information manager like Microsoft
Outlook or Entourage on desktop or notebook computers.  As numbers are
updated on one side or the other, conflicts inevitably ensue: is my
friend's new home number the one on my computer, or the one on my
phone?

Thanks to new cellphones and to software from phone manufacturers and
others, saying goodbye to all that thumb-busting key-punching is
relatively easy. Make the connection, and the phone and computer can
exist in complete harmony. What's more, the latest cellphone
synchronization tools can also import other information like tasks and
Lotus Notes data, making it possible to leave the hand-held home and
make do with the phone, albeit with compromises.

The first consideration is how to connect your phone and computer. A
special U.S.B. cable made for your phone model is often the easiest
solution. If no cable is available at the cellphone store, check the
provider's or phone manufacturer's Web store. Such cables generally
cost $50 or less. If there is no specific cable for your phone model,
a third-party solution -- often paired with software -- may be the
answer.

Cellphone suits targeting firms Companies whose workers cause 
accidents face liability

By Laura Parker
USA TODAY

McLEAN, Va. -- As a 29-year-old technology lawyer on the rise, Jane 
Wagner drove a silver Mercedes and billed clients for the time she 
talked to them from her car. She routinely made as many as 40 
cellphone calls a day.

On March 8, 2000, during a call she made at 10:36 p.m., she hit and 
killed a 15-year-old girl, Naeun Yoon, on a busy highway in Fairfax 
County, Va., just outside Washington.

Now Yoon's parents have filed a civil suit against Wagner, who served 
a one-year jail term on work release after pleading guilty to leaving 
the scene of an accident. But in seeking $30 million in damages, 
Yoon's father, Young Ki Yoon, also is suing Wagner's former employer, 
the law firm Cooley Godward, based in San Francisco.

At the heart of the claim against the law firm are the cellphone 
calls that Wagner made when she was working. The suit alleges that 
the firm is partly liable for the accident because Wagner's job 
involved doing business -- in lawyers' parlance, amassing 'billable 
hours' -- by cellphone. Such calls, the suit says, were done 'with 
the expectation and acquiescence of Cooley Godward and served as a 
direct benefit to ... the law firm.'

The case, scheduled for trial in September, is part of a growing 
number of lawsuits against businesses whose employees are involved in 
car accidents while talking on cellphones. The Wagner and Cooley 
Godward trial could have costly implications for businesses across 
the nation whose productivity is tied to the hours their employees 
spend on mobile phones, which have expanded the boundaries of the 
modern office.

They are a Science Fiction publisher who has started putting their
older titles online for free, as HTML, RTF, and others.  No copy
protection, no nothing.

And guess what?, their older title book sales started increasing!

I bought a book of theirs, and it had a CDRom in the back with that
book and about 20 more on it.  Since I was going into the Hospital for
a week this was a godsend!

At the cost of some degradation of the signal.  That's why people are
getting so worked up over attempts to prevent digital copying.  (IMHO
the jury is still out over whether an analog dub from a CD really is
inferior to a digital "rip" of the same track, after both have been
encoded in MP3 at the usual 128 kbps.)


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Tell the Jury that the slightly
inferior signal is actually pretty good considering what you paid
for it. There really is no difference. An audiophile which very fancy
equipment could tell the difference; almost no one else. PAT]

Agreed. If you really want to understand what the media companies are
doing and why they are so against opening their catalogs to individual
sales, you just need to look at the history of a company called
Personics,

Personics started up in the early 80s and tried to license catalogs
from the major record companies. They built kiosks and put them in
record stores around the country. The kiosks were capable of producing
licensed copies of cassettes on demand.

No inventory costs. The cassettes sold for a premimum compared to
prerecorded cassettes. The retailler made money, the record company
received license fees with no distribution costs. You'd think it was a
sure thing. Wrong.

The record companies would only allow certain songs to be included in
the machine catalog, usually obscure songs by unknown artists. And if
any of thoses songs proved to be too popular, the song was pulled from
the machine.

Why? The record companies thrive on artificial scarcity as Peter
described. But exactly the same logic applies why you can't buy
individual channels from your cable company. The media companies don't
want you to.

Their whole business model is built around selling you one or two
songs (or channels) you want and 18 that you don't want. They know
that most people rationalize the purchase of a CD by saying that it's
only a $1 or $2 per song and they would rather sell you two CDs for
$40, than 2 individual songs for $2.

The idea of individual song sales terrifies them. Personics tried to
sell mail order as well, was bought out by Warner Brothers and
eventually folded.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Did you ever notice how many of the
'Best of X Greatest Hits' albums, tapes and CDs on the market are
maybe eighty percent rehashed from prior recordings but there are
always one or two selections you have never heard before?  To get
those one or two selections, you have to buy the entire thing with
a dozen or more works you already have two or three copies of? It
is a rip off, to be sure.   PAT]

Subject: New Billboards Sample Radios as Cars Go By, Then Adjust


By MATT RICHTEL

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 26 - Tom Langeland cannot hear your car radio.
But he purports to be able to figure out what you're listening to -
whether rock 'n' roll, sports, talk or news - in the privacy of your
speeding automobile.

Pursuing a business plan that has a science fiction bent but also 
some skeptics, Mr. Langeland intends to modify electronic freeway 
billboard advertisements by remote control to reflect your tastes, 
and those of thousands of other drivers.

As part of a $20 million investment, Mr. Langeland, a Sacramento-based
entrepreneur, has erected 10 billboards that can display both video
and text and can be programmed with changing messages and images. In
addition, the billboards include fledgling technology that is designed
to identify the radio frequencies of passers-by.

Mr. Langeland, chief executive of the Alaris Media Network, intends to
deduce demographic information from the radio stations drivers are
listening to and then display advertising aimed at them based on
income, sex, race and buying habit data. He said the idea was not to
single out individuals, but drivers en masse. For instance, if a
preponderance of rush-hour drivers are tuned to a radio station known
to have affluent or educated listeners, then the advertisements at
that time would be aimed at them.

Subject: F.C.C. Lets Convicted Hacker Go Back on Net


By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WASHINGTON, Dec. 26 (AP) - A hacker once labeled by the federal
government as "the most wanted computer criminal in U.S. history" has
won a long fight to renew his ham radio license, and next month may
resume surfing the Internet.

The hacker, Kevin Mitnick, 39, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., served five 
years in federal prison for stealing software and altering data at 
Motorola, Novell, Nokia, Sun Microsystems and the University of 
Southern California. Prosecutors accused him of causing tens of 
millions of dollars in damage to corporate computer networks.

Mr. Mitnick was freed in January 2000. The terms of his probation, 
which expires on Jan. 20, require that he get government permission 
before using computers, software, modems or any devices that connect 
to the Internet. His travel and employment also are limited.

He has been allowed to use a cellphone and received permission this 
year to type a manuscript on a computer not connected to the Internet.

Subject: Hotel Chains to Offer Wireless Internet


By Chris Woodyard, USA TODAY

The hotel industry is embarking on a new high-tech venture: bringing 
wireless Internet to lounges and conference rooms.

Marriott said last week that it will install wireless Internet in the
public areas of 400 hotels by next spring. Hilton plans to equip 200
hotels with the service. Starwood, which operates the Westin,
Sheraton, St. Regis and W brands, is studying the issue.

Wayport, a company specializing in bringing high-speed Internet to
travelers, has rigged 475 hotels with wired and so-called Wi-Fi
wireless systems.

One luxury property, The Adolphus in Dallas, expects to have wireless 
access throughout the hotel, including guest rooms, next month.

Subject: Long-Distance Bills Headed Upward in 2003; New Fees, Rate Hikes


Page 1A
By Andrew Backover
USA TODAY

The days of falling long-distance phone bills may be over.

More new fees and rate increases are expected next year on top of a 
bevy of recent increases by No. 2 long-distance carrier MCI and 
others.

That's because phone companies have to raise more revenue to counter 
the effect of long-distance price wars and consumers turning to 
cellphones and e-mail. "I only see continued increases in 
long-distance rates," says Rich Sayers, who runs the Web site 
10-10PhoneRates.com.

For consumers, the higher costs could amount to a few extra bucks a 
month at a time when a sluggish economy has many cutting spending. 
One way to avoid increases is to shop for 'bundles', which give 
discounts for buying multiple services from one company.

Sprint waves a $5.95 monthly fee on one long-distance plan if 
customers also buy its wireless service. WorldCom's MCI sells 'The 
Neighborhood' plan, which offers unlimited long-distance and local 
calls for $50 to $60 a month.

In the UK, cablecos have provided a telephony alternative to BT
(British Telecom) for well over ten years.

Sadly, they tend to work on tarrifs that just undercut BT, but aren't
required to give open access in such areas as ADSL.

A totally unscientific sample: Both neighbors on either side of me now
get their wireline service from Insight Communications, the cable
company here in Louisville (http://www.insight-com.com/ -- *not*
insight.com or insight-comm.com).  I would, too, just to spite
BellSouth -- and also because Insight's rates are somewhat lower --
but they don't offer call forwarding on busy, which I use to bounce
calls to my wireless phone.

For those unfamiliar with cable telephony, a quick description of how
it's provisioned: There is a box that goes on the outside wall of the
building, looking very much like the network interfaces that telcos
use these days for residential demarcs, but it contains A/D
converters, a DOCSIS modem and other goodies.  The service drop
carries 60V DC to power the unit, so the tap box (at the pole or in
the back yard) has to be set up to pass power to phone customers and
block it to those who only have TV and/or Internet services.  Like a
telco demarc, this has two access doors, one for the side where the
drop cable connects, the other for customer access.  On the customer
side there is a coaxial connector for the cable going to TV sets and
cable modems -- presumably this is locked off to block access if a
customer only takes phone service --- and screw terminals for inside
wire, with RJ11 jacks and plugs for test purposes as usual.  Insight's
boxes will support up to four lines, so if you want to add a line you
just run your inside wire to the appropriate jacks, call them to turn
on the service, and start writing larger monthly checks.

One thing I didn't like about Insight's installation was that the guy
just ran some wire (not sure if it was quad, Cat 3 or Cat 5) over from
the box to the screw terminals on the BellSouth demarc, after
unplugging the plug from the RJ11 test jack, instead of doing
something to bring the customer's inside wire over from the BellSouth
demarc to the Insight box.

Actually, by the time the tune is subjected to the compression of an
MP3, it doesn't matter how sophisticated the listener's equipment is.
For all intents and purposes, an analog rip of a given track will be
just as good as the digital rip. The only difference (to the person
performing the transfer) is the inconvenience of literally recording
the audio in real time, and then trimming it.

I made a private promise to myself about this. I have never downloaded
an MP3 in my life. I have never so much as given away one single rip
of any track from my library of thousands of CDs (but I rip them to
use in my iPod and in the car). Here's the promise: the first time I
am forced to make an analog rip of a so-called copy-protected CD, the
rips are all going up on a website. If I'm going to be forced to go to
extra effort just to be able to enjoy a CD I paid good money for,
others will benefit from that effort as well.

The reality is that I have pretty much given up buying CDs. I'm not
sure I want to even bother with the hassle, or the expense of buying a
CD player that can deal with the new crippled CDs.

Subject: What am I Missing Here; Calling Cards
Date: Sat, 28 Dec 2002 01:22:56 GMT


I used to have long distance service through a reseller that I thought
was cheap, $0.05/min in California after 5pm and 0.09 during peak
time.  Interstate calls were $0.09 at all times.

What ate me up were not the call charges, I really don't make that
many LD calls on my landline (use my cell mostly), but the taxes.  For
a $2.50 LD bill, I would get near $6 in taxes each month.

So, I called SBC and discontinued LD.  Now I use an AT&T calling card
purchased at Sam's Club which costs $0.0347/min with no taxes.  I even
use it to dial around SBC's exorbitant local toll rates.  I just
programmed the 800 number and the card number into speed dial.

Why does AT&T sell these cards so cheap while they "rape" their
customers who have subscribed to them with monthly fees, etc.?

Yes ... I'm one of the people they left behind, and I'm now enjoying
my first day of service on SpeedFactory: same line, same price per
month, same data speed, and noticeably quicker DNS resolution. (Three
DNS, not two, and not all in the same place.)

My dumb question: Why is SpeedFactory making money when
DirecTVInternet wasn't making money?

One thing I suspect is that SpeedFactory doesn't try to sell to
Grandma ... they seem to target people like me, who know something
about configuring their own equipment.  (In fact I got it going even
though the DSL router arrived in a box with no documentation ... the
doc is in the mail to arrive tomorrow.)  This probably keeps their
support costs down.

Any other theories?

Subject: Pacific Bell Central Office Names


Hello,

Hoping anyone might be able to help with this question.  Does Pacbell
"name" their CO's?  For example, most of their CO's are named for the
community they are located in.  For more dense areas that have more
then one office in a community or city, how does Pacbell defferentiate
between offices?  Is it a simple as San Diego CO 1 and San Diego CO 2
 ... etc, or does each CO have a specific name (street, etc)?  I have a
list of Pac Bell exchanges but for some exchanges there are many CO's
with the same exchange name just different CLLI numbers.

I know Verizon in California names their CO's if more then one in an
exchnage area.  Example: There are two CO's in the Lancaster exchange,
1 CO is named "Lancaster" while the other is named "Antelope".  Just
wondering if Pacbell did the same thing and if anyone could foward the
list or database.

Thanks for the help.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I know Ameritech in Chicago, IL has all
their central office buildings geographically named in most instances
by the streets or neighborhoods they are located in. And for each
formal central office name there is also an informal (in general use)
name for the same place. For instance, the central office which serves
the University of Chicago, located at 61st and Kenwood Streets is
known informally as 'Kenwood Bell'. Another example is 'Kedzie Bell'
which is located on the west side around Roosevelt Road and Kedzie 
Avenue. Those two, and several others were named back in the 1950's
after the streets they are located on and (obviously) the company
which originally owned them. Both of those two were originally very
large Traffic Department facilities (operator centers) on their 
second and third floors with the switching equipment on the first
floor. Officially, they were 'Chicago-Kenwood' and 'Chicago-Kedzie';
along with 'Chicago-Rogers Park', 'Chicago-Edgewater', 'Chicago-Superior'
'Chicago-Illinois/Dearborn', 'Chicago-Franklin', 'Chicago-Dearborn',
'Chicago-Wabash', and 'Chicago-Lakeview' just to name a few on the
north side and downtown areas of Chicago. Chicago-Wabash for many
years had the informal name 'the Wabash CannonBall' because for many
years after the other offices had gone to crossbar switching, the
folks in 312-922, 312-939 and a few other exchanges still had the
old fashioned (and very noisy) stepping switches. Literally, when 
one walked past the 65 East Congress Parkway building, the noise at
times was deafening. I know you did not ask about Chicago, but I
decided to tell you anyway. PAT]

Subject: Why Won't my Sprint PCS Phone Roam? (Samsung SCH-3500)
Date: Sat, 28 Dec 2002 02:27:16 -0800
Organization: LincMad.com Consulting
Reply-To: Telecom@LincMad.com


I've had a Sprint PCS phone, specifically a Samsung SCH-3500, for
almost three years now. In those three years, I have had two occasions
to attempt an outgoing call while outside Sprint's network. Both
times, the signal meter indicated I had a strong signal, and I did
everything the phone's manual said to do in order to make a roaming
call, but the calls never connected. I also just did a test here in
San Francisco with the same results. In addition, I also attempted an
incoming call while the phone was in analog roaming mode.

The only option I have for roaming is the analog cellular network, and
my phone doesn't display any ID for the specific carrier.

The first occasion was in early September 2002 in Susanville, CA. The
second was in mid-October near Woodbury, TN. The third test was today
in San Francisco, CA. In all three cases, I accessed the phone's menu
and changed "Roaming Mode" from "Sprint PCS only" to "Analog Roam."
The phone then searched for service and locked onto what appeared to
be a valid signal from an analog cell. I dialed the number, pressed
TALK, and pressed 1 to confirm that I really wanted to make a roaming
call.  The little telephone handset icon then blinked and blinked and
blinked, indicating that it was trying to establish a circuit for the
call. In all three cases, though, the icon just blinked, never
completing the call. I tried each call more than once, always with the
same result. On each attempt, I waited at least a full minute or two,
and in one case over six minutes. None of these calls was at any time
I would expect to be a peak usage hour.

My inference from my admittedly cursory knowledge of cellular roaming
is that my phone is not sending all the information that the analog
network needs to bill the call, and therefore the analog network is not
completing the circuit.

Does that sound like I'm on the right track? If so, what might it be
missing and how do I get it squared away? If not, what might the
problem be?

I talked to Customer Service today, and their only suggestion was to
take the phone in to a Sprint PCS retail store to see if they can
figure out what's going on. I probably will do that, but I figured I'd
start by asking people who might actually know something.

Recent versions of Mozilla/Phoenix more granularity.  You can control

something similar with its "trusted-sites" zone.  This can be
acomplished manually also.  I post to two websites that require login.
They have the *OPTION* of either logging in each time, or having their
cookies. Cookies are definitely convenient there.  I opened up my
cookies, logged in, exited the browser, and set the cookie file to
read-only.  The login cookies are now safe.

With the cookie file set to read-only, I can throw the cookie
settings wide open.  All cookies will be accepted to memory while
browsing, but they will not be saved when I shut down the browser.

Palladium ain't done till linux won't run


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I need some help getting my cookies to
work  correctly. I use something called 'Proxomitron' which eliminates
all advertising on web pages and almost all pop-up windows. It uses
port 8080 to do its thing. My objective is to eliminate all ads and
pop up windows. I use it on my Opera browser and get the desired
results. But I like to read news on my.yahoo.com and chicagotribune.com
and my constantly scrolling ticker tape news comes from my.yahoo.com
among other places. Internet Explorer is the controlling browser on 
my Windows XP and Windows 98 machines. If I turn Proximotron on when 
using my IE browser, Yahoo and Chicago Tribune refuse to deal with me.
Yahoo just won't let me login to any department (including the
scrolling ticker-tape news headlines) and chicagotribune.com keeps
insisting my cookies are mangled up, and it wants me to completely log
out and log back in so it can reinstall its cookies. So I wound up
disconnecting Proxomitron from IE, but leaving it on Opera. So I use
the latter to read some things and I use IE for other things, and 
constantly close pop-up windows and see advertising on Yahoo. I wish
I knew how to properly set the options on Proxomitron. I also use a
'windows washer' program (like a laundry machine, with strong
detergent and lots of 'bleach') whenever I turn the computer on or
off. I've seen the 'laundry machine' grind up and sweep away as much
as ten megs worth of the filthy, foul smelling stuff each day. I 
suspect that may be tampering with the cookies also. I wish I could
use Proxomitron for IE stuff as well, but probably my computer is
all messed up internally. :(  Having had a brain aneurysm (my beloved
brain desease) doesn't help me with these matters either.   PAT]

Subject: Question About This Basic SBC Yahoo DSL
Date: Sun, 29 Dec 2002 01:10:37 -0800
Organization: Posted via Supernews, http://www.supernews.com


My family friend just got basic SBC Yahoo DSL
(http://promo.yahoo.com/sbc/dsl/ ). They can only connect to the
Internet from one PC (XP Home Edition OS) directly to the DSL modem as
PPPoE.  I gave them my spare used 3Com router that works with other
ISPs (RoadRunner cable, Charter Communications cable, and Verizon
DSL), the 3Com router can quickly connect as PPPoE like the XP.  For
some reason I can't ping any IP number to the outside world but SBC
DSL tech support can ping the 3Com router and I always see the
router's security audit trail log with lots of intrusion attempts into
it, port scan, etc.  If I can't ping anyone to the outside world,
neither I can surf the Internet thru this 3Com router.

So what good it is if it can't be shared to other PCs in the house?

Can the DSL provider like SBC Yahoo DSL can do something so basic
subscribers can't share the Internet to several PCs in their home?

Are the broadband provider now discouraging their subscribers to use
routers and share the Internet to several PCs in their home?

being there, etc. I said okay, then toddled off to bed for a good
night's sleep. When I said it was a 'secret, hidden spy-cam' I mean I
have not mentioned it to any neighbors/friends, etc. Something woke me
up around 2:00 AM and I remembered I had not shut the computer and

on my desk top -- all three of them; still the dunce and his friend
did not know what they were or how they worked. I found the two of
them slightly indisposed here in the computer room, and as I rushed

looked terribly hurt; I then apologized for screaming at *them*; and

*don't think* anyone was watching at the time; I would have heard
something by now if there had been one or more viewers, I am
sure. They had no idea the cams were there, let alone turned on; and

%T   "Know Your Enemy: Revealing the Security Tools, Tactics, and
      Motives of the Blackhat Community"

I have frequently said that any book with "hack," or any variant
thereof, in the title is automatically suspect.  This work helps prove
my point, first, because the Honeynet Project members have *not* used
the term (they refer to attackers as blackhats), and the text also
notes the problems with "exploit" type books: they list old and known
attacks, most of which are protected against, and say nothing about
the attackers and how they work.  Chapter one points out the value of
"knowing the enemy" and the beginnings of the Honeynet Project.

Part one describes the honeynet.  Chapter two explains what a honeynet
is, and the difference between one and the traditional honeypots.
Details on how a honeynet works, in terms of architecture, policies,
and the risks and responsibilities of operating one, are presented in
chapter three.  Building a honeynet, in chapter four, presents
specific details, although a number have already been given.

Part two concerns the analysis of data collected from the Honeynet.
Chapter five, on data analysis, points out the sources of data for
logging, much of which has already been discussed.  There is some more
information on what we can find, but limited explanation of how to
interpret it.  The discussion of analyzing a compromised system, in
chapter six, is more detailed and does a better job of explaining the
logs, but relies on a blackhat document, which, while better than most
such, still has the holes and gaps that characterize the genre.
Additional details are provided in advanced data analysis, plus some
material on data that is (and some that is not) useful in packets,
plus forensic (data recovery) considerations, in chapter seven.
(Interestingly, the Honeynet Project does not seem to be concerned
with wiping a drive in order to deny information to blackhats.)
Chapter eight examines data recovery tools and some results.

Part three explains what the project has determined about "the enemy"
by the types of attacks that have been launched and detected.  Chapter
nine is a general review of the random nature of attacks, the tools
seen, motives theorized, and trends in attacks.  The activities and
signatures of the Bymer worm are described in chapter ten.  An IRC
conversation between a group of blackhats is provided in chapter
eleven.  While there is some interest in the account, the transcript
occupies almost 100 pages (and almost a third of the total length of
the book).  Chapter twelve suggests the future activities of the
Honeynet Project.

Much of the material in the book is repeated, sometimes in a number of
places.  The text would definitely benefit from a tightening up of the
material.  In addition, the early examples are not thoroughly
explained, making the reader initially feel that only a firewall audit
log specialist would be able to understand what is being said.
However, most of the book is written clearly and well, and it is
definitely worth reading.

Organization: http://groups.google.com/


Ok folks, I'll try to keep this one from being too long (famous last
words):

I live in Austin, Texas.
I make a lot of calls to Ireland.
I use SBC for my local / long distance and international calls.

They provided me with an SBC calling card when I switched to them a
few months ago.

I used the calling card to make calls to Ireland from my office (so my
employer would not have to pay for my calls).

The bill came in and they have billed me $215.46 for 88 minutes.
Some of the calls are 1 minute long and they charge me $7.00 for one
minute.

The SBC website says (and I quote):

"SBC's Calling Card Services eliminates telephone "sticker shock" by
protecting consumers and businesses from high rates often associated
with calls made from some public pay phones. Our calling card gives
you easy access to local, long distance, and international phone
service virtually anywhere in the world. You can also request
additional cards for business associates"

So, I figured that when it says in the small print that a "surcharge
may apply" that it would be a reasonable percentage.

Under pricing for the calling card on their website it says:

"Pricing:
SBC Calling Card Services costs nothing to set up and is
available to all customers who already have phone service. You only
pay for the calls made using the card number."

I've tried to call SBC to dispute these charges.  After 1 hour on the
phone and speaking to 5 people they finally tell me that those charges
are right and that I should really only use the card in EMERGENCIES
because they charge all kinds of connection fees ($4 per call and
$1.75 per minute)

These rates are not listed anywhere that I can find.  I feel ripped
off.  Have I any protection against this??????

By the way, The 88 minutes if made from my home phone would have cost
approx $13 (thirteen) from my calling card its an extra $200.

I never got my complaint resolved with SBC in the end because after
one hour of talking to people I finally got put on hold and then
mysteriously cut off.

Can anyone advise me on what I should do.  I feel like they falsely
advertised their service due to the quoted text above.  Check out the
links of info on their calling card service at the following address.

Thanks for any advice.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: My experience (mine only) is that the
ONLY thing SBC understands are commission complaints. They are terribly
fraudulent with things like Privacy Manager for example. Some other
readers may make suggestions worth trying but I will suggest you cut 
to the chase -- keep it simple -- and file a complaint with your
local consumer organization and also with your state commission. And
split from SBC to one of the resellers as soon as possible and convenient
to do so. They hit me up for $40.00 (forty dollars) last month for
using their call trace (*57) feature trying to track down the source
of literally dozens of 'wrong number' calls from AT&T (of all people!)
who were sending ten zeros and 'name withheld' as their caller-ID
on my distinctive ringing line. And their DSL service, ooh-la-la, what
mounds of spam!  My mailbox on sbcglobal.net got wedged yesterday from
two days worth of spam; when I called in I was told 'your mailbox is
120 percent of capacity; we are going to return your mail to the
senders.'  When I asked them once again why they did not instead use
some kind of filters against spam, this tech guy got very self-righteous
with me about how Southwestern Bell does not dictate what you get in
your email. So I am sort of a prisoner; if I do NOT call in and clean
out my mailbox two or three times daily, it overflows and they return
all mail to the senders. You see, I skipped Saturday this past week.

Then I got in the middle of tossing out all the spam manually a pop-up
window from SBC telling me how I could subscribe for a fee to their
mail sorting service; if I pay them more than the fifty dollars per
month I do already, they *will* sort the spam out. So tech-desk, don't
get so self-righteous with me; its all money in your case. Yeah, I
would say just file commission complaints as a routine thing. "Excuse
me. Mr. Commissioner, I hate to disturb your lunch while you are
eating out of the hand of SWB, but could you please consider my
complaint?" Say the above to the commission, they get very annoyed
by it; but you know it is largely true.  PAT]

The PacBell COs in the San Jose area are numbered (SJ12, SJ14, etc.)
but they have been traditionally known, at least internally, by their
first exchange names. For instance, SJ12 is known as "ALpine"; SJ14 is
known as "ANdrews". Some of the other COs: AXminster (corner of
Bellomy and Winchester in Santa Clara); CLayburn (White Road in San
Jose); CYpress (downtown).

Then there are the exceptions. The "Almaden" CO was originally an
unmanned office controlled from ANdrews. "Space Park" was added in
Santa Clara some time after the exchange names had long been
abandoned. The "Abel" CO in Milpitas has always been referred to as
such, even though it has been around since the AMhearst days. These
are all names derived from the streets or roads on which they are
located.

One of the complications for naming COs is the fact that many of them
serve more than one community. The ALpine CO serves the following
communities: San Jose, Cupertino, Campbell, and Saratoga. The ANdrews
CO serves San Jose and Campbell.

In fact, Campbell has an interesting situation. The city itself has no
CO. While it is a city large enough to have over a dozen prefixes, it
is served by two San Jose central offices. To the east of Highway 17,
it is served from ANdrews. Everyone on the west side of 17 is served
from the ALpine office. The latter office is located many miles to the
west of the Campbell city limits, and until recently DSL was out of
the question for anyone on the west side of town. SBC has been adding
fiber hubs to rectify that situation.

I have poked through a number of PacBell internal databases and there
is no universal agreement among them regarding the naming of COs. My
knowlege comes from five decades of dealing with engineers and
technicians for the company.

Legacy name recognition of ATT and advertising overload from non
competitive carriers leading to mass confusion, so people don't have
the time or don't think they can change.  IDT seems to be breaking the
barrier, now if IDT would just post INstate rates and taxes on their
website ... more obfiscation:(

Wish I could get around that darn SBC 12 mile "zone 3" first minute
 .05 rip off rate! Maybe if I can trick ATT to offer the expanded local
only service. Wonder if they could be forced to unbundle local toll
and LD?  Until then it's the cell phone for short zone 3 calls.

I'd bet many folks aren't capable of programming a speed dial phone or
are too impatient to set up and dial another step with a web based
calling card, even with the advanced "NO PIN" feature.

With all the included (often crappy sounding) wireless LD, people are
getting use to much better LD rates, even if it is essentially prepaid
and late night weekend weighted.

There's even better per minute rates in major metro areas, using local
access numbers instead of toll free numbers for calling cards.

You can have a discount LD carrier also handle local toll calls as
well, though there will still be taxes.

Hope the hungry tax collector doesn't take aim at untaxed calling card
revenue. The thrifty are saving loads!

No, but they can refuse to support it, although SBC ameritech.net tech
support employees didn't seem to care about the Netopia router I had
running off my SBC DSL line when I had SBC DSL.

There's no technical reason you shouldn't be able to get the router to
work, but don't expect SBC to support it.

My new broadband provider at home (Adelphia, with their Powerlink
cable Internet service) doesn't have a problem with multiple computers
hooked up to their service, though they officially do not allow
servers ... their literature specifies that you may hook up as many as
four PCs. It varies by provider. Many SBC resellers might allow
multiple PCs and support routers.

Can you give more details? Have you checked over on

Have you had a Sprint tech flash the firmware on your phone and/or

My wife has a Sprint PCS phone but we don't ever roam off Sprint's

Subject: Foreign Affairs and ICANN: Privatizing Internet's Infrastructure
Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2002 18:00:10 UTC
Organization: PANIX Public Access Internet and UNIX, NYC


There is an article about ICANN in the November/December 2002 issue of
Foreign Affairs journal. The article "Governing the Internet"(pgs
15-20) by Zoe Baird admits the failure of ICANN as a way to privatize
the Internet's infrastructure. (ICANN is the Internet Corporation for
Assigned Names and Numbers, an entity created by the U.S. government
to privatize the domain name system, root server system, IP numbering
system and protocol creation process. These form the public
infrastructure of the Internet. Whoever controls these controls the
Internet.)

She writes: "The rapid growth of the Internet has led to a worldwide
crisis of governance."

However, the author seems to know nothing about the development of the
Internet or does she seem to care about its development.

She writes: "In the early years of Internet development, the
prevailing view was that government should stay out of Internet
governance; market forces and self-regulation would suffice to create
order and enforce standards of behavior."

This makes one wonder what she considers as the early years of
Internet development.

This coming new year (2003) is the 30th anniversary of the birth of
TCP/IP and the 20th anniversary of the cutover from the protocol NCP
on the ARPANET to TCP/IP, a protocol which made it possible to have an
Internet.

The early development of the Internet was done under government. The
form of government, however, was a good form, (unlike much we see
since). This form of government in the U.S.was an office within the US
Dept of Defense under the leadership of computer scientists.

If Zoe Baird were interested in understanding what is wrong with
ICANN, it would be appropriate to learn this history and understand
the lessons from it with regard to the future development of the
Internet.

Instead, she has a new proposal to replace ICANN. She is currently
President of an NGO, the Markle Foundation. Not surprisingly, she is
proposing that the new ICANN be designed to include NGO's and
Government and Industry.

This is as contrary to the Internet's origins as is ICANN.

Thus she acknowledges a serious problem. But her treatment of this
problem shows disdain for the Internet and its origins.

Yet it is significant that the problem ICANN represents should be
included in an issue of a journal like Foreign Affairs. This
demonstrates that the Internet is under the foreign policy purvue of
the US government and they are planning new means of trying to forge
that policy ignoring the nature and needs of the Internet and its
users.

This is an important challenge for the new year for netizens.

May we find ways to collaborate to take on challenges like this in
2004.

P.S. I have recently heard from someone I know that there is an effort
of people to propose legislation that would be helpful toward various
forms of media in the U.S. In this context he asked what kind of
legislation would people propose regarding the Internet and its
development. This is a topic that would take serious discussion and
consideration. So hopefully there will be a way to have such
discussion in the new year.

Following are some of the more recent research and writing I have done
to try to understand the nature of the government institution that
made it possible to create the Internet, and the nature of the
international collaboration that was so crucial to the development of
the international computer communications metasystem that we call the
Internet.

the author of the magazine article is correct in saying things were
very loose and freewheeling in those early days. The federal employees
who were supposed to be in charge of things around here were not all
that intelligent and sophisticated about computers (remember, this was
in the late sixties and early seventies) so by default the net was
left in the hands of the 'geeks' who *did* know about it. Things were
left in that loose, relatively unorganized manner for the first
several years, probably until 1993 or so, which many netizens would
assert was the year our 'community' was pretty much run over by the
bulldozer of the web and the new crowd of people who came around. PAT]

Subject: Prison Call Overcharging
Organization: Net Access BBS
Date: Tue, 31 Dec 2002 14:57:01 GMT


Inmates in prison may make collect calls to their families.  However,
the family is charged very steep fees for such calls -- much more than
today's routine collect call charges.  For example, $3 for the first
minute, $1 each additional minute.

This appears to be a common practice across the U.S.

People might argue "too bad, they're in prison!", but that misses
several important points:

It's not the inmate who's paying for the calls, but the family.
Further, such families are often poor.

There is no reason collect calls from a prison should cost any more
than collect calls from regular locations.  (And remember, routine
collect calls today are very expensive).  And the actual cost to the
prison for the cost is very little -- maybe 5c a minute, since states
have bulk contracts with toll carriers.  The collect charges are pure
gravy for the state.

Another consideration is that family contact is important for an
inmate's rehabilitation.  Many inmates are imprisoned far from the
homes, and too far for families to visit.  A rehabiliated inmate won't
commit fresh crimes upon his release.

Likewise, family contact reduces stress.  Stressed inmates get into
fights and start riots which are extremely costly.  In other words,
frequent family contact is good for society.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: For God sakes, Lisa! How are you doing?
You used to be in discussions here quite frequently, then just dropped
away. I dunno where you been, but welcome back!  Now to address the
points raised in your article: You are, of course, quite correct. But
to the 'corrections industry' you are a very dangerous person with
very dangerous ideas. Prisoners who are rehabilitated are less likely
to return to prison, but where would the 'industry' be in that case?
Their intake agents who work the streets (police officers and parole/
probation officers, judges) would have to work harder to keep the
joints as full and overrun as they are now.

Consider it from their perspective: inmates are scum, and by extension
so are most of their families and friends. Why would you want to give
scum any sort of even break or fair shake in life?  All you are likely
to do is rehabilitate a few more of them, and make it harder on
yourself, your government budget and *your* co-workers, friends and
family, none of whom are scum, obviously. You *have* to keep prisoners
demoralized and at each other's throats in order for your system to
work. People like you need to understand that prisons are purely 
*voluntary* places. Consider for example if prisoners were by and
large in solidarity, and simply 'offed' a guard or other prison
official on a semi-regular basis?

What does all that have to do with the cost of phone calls from
prison?  Phone calls are deliberatly kept expensive for the same
reason states like Illinois (which gets ninety percent of its
prisoners from Chicago) builds all of its newer prisons hundreds of
miles away from Chicago; to assure that all the black ladies and their
babies have to ride the Salvation Army bus on an all-day trip when
they try to go and see their men who are in prison. Six hour bus ride
to get from Chicago to the prisons, six hour bus ride to get back
home, and a *thirty minute* allowed time for visiting when there. With
some luck, the Salvation Army bus will get sideswiped by a large
semi-truck on I-55 outside of Chicago as happened two years ago at
Christmas and all the passengers get killed including the bus driver
except for one little baby who somehow survived. That day the scummy
inmates didn't get their thirty minute Christmas visitors. No, Lisa,
the phone thing is deliberate. Its all part of the cruel joke called
'prisoner rights'. Years and years ago, no phone calls were allowed at
all, then the Supremes (a very liberal bunch at the time; no need to
worry about that now) told the prisons they had to allow *some* contact
with the outside world for rehabilitation purposes. The prisons decided
to retaliate by doing what the court required, but making it prohibitively
expensive. If the scum's wife takes a second job to pay the phone bills
then they can have phone calls. 

And look at the well-known problem of homosexual rape in prisons. Why
do you suppose the corrections industry essentially turns a blind eye
to that scandal?  Any man, homosexual or heterosexual who attempts to
maintain his dignity in that way is treated as a trouble maker, not 
the guys who attacked him. Its all part of the need the corrections
industry has to maintain control and keep their joints filled up and
expanding no matter what.  Lisa, you are *one hundred percent correct*
in your feelings about phones and prisons. But get used to it, nothing
is going to change anytime soon.   PAT]

Subject: A Phone That Answers When Called


By SABRA CHARTRAND

Phone systems today commonly include features like caller
identification, call waiting and automatic redial. But what is the
point of all the bells and whistles if you cannot get to a ringing
phone in time to answer it?

It has happened to everyone. Your work phone rings when you are deep
in paperwork or have just taken a bite of lunch. The home phone rings
when you are in the shower or have just started up the stairs. You
cannot pick up the receiver before the caller gives up or the
answering machine clicks on.

It happened to David Millrod more times than he could count. So he
invented and patented a phone that can be answered with a verbal
command.

A user can shout, "Answer phone!" from across the room, and the phone 
will open the line and play a message telling the caller to hold on 
until the user can pick up the call.

Subject: So Many Holes, So Few Hacks


By Michelle Delio

Experts who discover and report security holes seem to be far more 
industrious than the malicious hackers willing or able to exploit 
those holes.

Despite the thousands of hackable holes that lurk in e-mail, on 
websites, in files and operating systems, most users' computers are 
never afflicted with more than the virtual version of a sniffle.

Few of the ominous potential traumas reported in 2002 turned out to 
have any real impact on most computer users. The Klez virus infected 
some machines and spawned spam that continues to clutter many e-mail 
inboxes. And the Linux Slapper worm made more work for some systems 
administrators for a while.

The rest of 2002's reported security holes appear to have languished, 
unexploited.

Some security experts suggest that malicious code attacks do happen 
but are dismissed by most users as just another wonky Windows 
software crash. But those same experts also cheerfully confess that 
most exploits aren't all that exploitable, and that the security 
industry profits by stirring up fear and frenzy.

Experts also wonder whether they and their colleagues devote entirely 
too much time to pouring over program code looking for possible 
exploits.

Parents of slain woman want to stop Internet brokers from selling

NASHUA, N.H. (AP) In the days after his stepdaughter's murder, Tim 
Remsburg funneled his fury into phone calls to anyone he thought 
might help explain her death.

"At two o'clock in the morning, I was trying to get President

His stepdaughter, Amy Boyer, was 20 when she was shot to death Oct. 
15, 1999, by a former high school classmate, Liam Youens, who had 
paid an Internet information broker to track her down.

For the three years since the murder, her parents have fought to 
protect other potential victims, most recently by suing the broker 
for negligence and invasion of privacy.

The battle has worn them out, but the couple isn't giving up.

It is a lot harder than it used to be. For one thing, staff cutbacks
by the ILECs have left few people available to conduct such tours. I
would imagine in this post 9/11 world, security is probably another
issue.

That said, I can tell you that tours of central offices ain't what
they used to be in terms of excitement. In the electromechanical days,
there was something to see (and hear). Rotary ring generators with
mercury-wetted contacts, Strowger or crossbar switches clacking away,
and caverns of wirewrap created a mind-blowing experience, even for
the telecom-ignorant.

Today's CO is nothing more than racks and racks of nondescript
electronic equipment. A Lucent 5ESS (common modern CO switch) is a
sterile closed cabinet assembly. Its actual control and test locations
are probably off-prem at a regional maintenance center. A tour of a
modern central office is now about as exciting as a walk through a
server room.

Except ... you might want to look at the power room. This is where 
batteries that supply 48 VDC to the system live. And we're talking about 
LOTS of 48 volts ... on the order of thousands of amperes. Some of that 
power keeps the switch and ancillary equipment working. But most of it 
is providing loop current to all the subscribers as well as remote fiber 
hubs, etc.

The batteries are under constant floating charge. In the event of a
power failure, the batteries keep everything going smoothly until
local emergency power comes on line.

It entirely depends on the telco.  My small local ILEC has an annual

In Los Angeles the Pac Bell (Now SBC) Central Offices are named after
the pre-1962 Exchange Names which roughly follows the surrounding
neighborhood.

For Example, in Hollywood, the office is HOllywood (323-46x) but which
now comprises 46x, 96x, 52x, and many more.

What's interesting is that the office names changed in the 40's when
dial service was introduced. Morningside, a manual exchange located on
Vermont, chnaged it's name to NOrmandy (323-66x), when they kicked out
the operators, added on to the building and filled the place with Step
equipment. (Now you can play Basketball in there - all DMS/ESS.)

Everyone still calls the office NOrmandy, but they now spell it
Normandie -- go figure.

I handle this a different why at my house.  All the PCs are setup to
use a local UNIX machine as a name server.  I did this at first
because my ISP's name servers we very slow, they may have fixed it by
now.  What this gives me is that I cache all name lookups and avoid a
lot of traffic just translating names to address for sites we tend to
use.

Now for the real fun.  I setup the DNS server to be the master for
doubleclick.net, trafficmp.com, and about 30 other domains.  It kills
popups, and tons of other ads.  If they change to
ads2.doubleclick.net, it kills them also.

I also look at the outgoing logs on my router/firewall about once a
week and add in other domains like site-stats.com and hitztracker.com.
Both of these sites use cookies to track web visits.

One technique I've heard rumors of is that the ISP's router decrements the
TTL of packets all the way to 1 before forwarding it, instead of just
decrementing it by 1 like normal routers do.  Then when the Customer's
router is forwarding the packet, it decrements it to 0, and drops the
packet because of TTL exceeded.

Some ISPs prohibit routers in their TOS.  Not all of them enforce it,
though; in many cases it's just a clause that they can use if they want to
terminate some customers who use excessive bandwidth.

>> Can the DSL provider like SBC Yahoo DSL can do something so basic
>> subscribers can't share the Internet to several PCs in their home?

Well, sort of.

There are two ways that ISPs set up DSL.  One treats your PC as part
of a big LAN, and uses a scheme called DHCP to assign its network
parameters.  The other treats your PC as a glorified dialup, and uses
a different scheme called PPPoE to assign parameters.  If you have to
log in with a user name and password to connect, that's PPPoE.  If the
DSL just starts up when you boot up your computer, that's DHCP.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn that some DSL providers, such as
Verizon in New Jersey, directly support multiple PCs per connection.
That is, you can plug several PCs into a network hub, plug the DSL
modem into the hub, and each PC can log in using PPPoE and use a
remote connection.  Although it's technically possible to do this with
DHCP, I don't know of any DHCP providers who support it.

So the first answer is that if your DSL provider doesn't want to
support multiple PCs via PPPoE or DHCP, they don't have to.

On the other hand, if you get a router, which you should because
they're widely available for about $50 and include a firewall to keep
bad guys out, you plug the router into the DSL modem and all of your
PCs into the router.  If your PCs are physically all close to each
other, you can get a router with regular Ethernet jacks and run cables
to your PCs.  If not, for more money you can get a WiFi router with
antennas on top, plug WiFi cards into your PCs elsewhere in your
house, and communicate by radio.

The DSL provider only sees the router, which looks like a single DHCP
or PPPoE PC, and all the connections from the PCs appear (to the DSL
provider) to be coming from the router.  It's nearly impossible for a
DSL provider to tell how many PCs are behind your router.  So get a
router and plug your PCs into it.  Another advantage of a router
compared to separate PPPoE connections is that the router puts all of
your PCs on a LAN, so you can safely share disks and printers among
them, with the routers keeping outsiders from hacking in.

With my cable modem only the MAC that it was set up with is
recognized.  The router that I added had an option to "clone MAC
address" so that it appears to be the same MAC as in the PC that was
"installed".

I don't know if DSL works the same way.  I had an SMC router installed
on my DSL, and I vaguely recall doing a clone ... or maybe the PPPoE
is what I'm remembering.

Your router or client computers are set up wrong.  This should work fine.

In fact, you can do the entire SBC DSL setup without installing anything on 
a PC.  Program the router for PPPoE withL
    	userid:   dslreguser
        password: reguser

And go to Web page
        https://secure.pacbell.net/dyndsl

to get a permanent userid/password which you then put in the router
and in your news setups.

To debug your W*nd*ws client setup, you might run "ipconfig /all"
(WinNT/2K/XP) or winipcfg (95/98/ME) and see what you have - your DHCP
server, DNS server, and default gateway should all point to your
router.

Can you ping your router by its IP address?

Alex and Newsgroup Members,

Myself and business associates in Hong Kong would be interested in the
idea you have about the CLID TO and FROM.

We need this when calling into the US from HK.  We are an
international auction house and have been in business over 75 years.
We discreetly have to make calls on behalf of clients selling or
bidding on objects who desire that others not know who they are so not
as to increase bidding because others know their identity. I do not
think a 900 number call can be made from HK to US. Can you clarify
this?

Instead of calling a 900 number ... could we call a specially assigned
DID number on your Nortel Switch ... then via the outcall feature
being activated in conjunction with an IVR device we could enter the
tel number we are calling TO and any number we desire we are calling
FROM (default would be the DID number or a US based voicemail box
(VMB) accessible by tel or Internet or any other tel number such as my
US HQ Ofc in Seattle.

We would pay for this service and all calls made (service fee and long
distance charges). Payment can be made via American Express or Bank
Wire. We would also agree to post a $500 monetary deposit.

How soon could you set this up?  What would your service fees be?

I would sincerely appreciate you answering me in this group or
emailing me.


Thanks,

Ivan

Then, of course, you have Call Waiting - Caller ID so you can look and
see who is trying to reach you and then make the appropriate decisions
as to wether you should terminate the first call and take the second,
ignore the second caller, etc.

After the recent complaints about PacHell, SBC, etc., I wondered about

You will note that no one can explain, or accept blame, for the

For years, I've told AT&T week after week not to call our home phone
number, and week after week we continue to get calls from from this
firm. The latest being this morning from their local service call
center in St. Louis.  1.800.288.2747

What I want to do is proceed with a civil lawsuit against AT&T for
damages, and to get fines applied to AT&T for continuing to make the
calls after I explicitly tell them to put us on their do not call
list.

Question: Does anyone know of any good web sites that explain similar
successful legal action against AT&T?

Question: Does anyone know the correct steps to file complaints
against AT&T?

I am in California.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Those fools kept calling me on my

I live in Sacramento and have driven by the billboard near the CalExpo
site off Business 80 in north Sacramento (the first of these
"intelligent" billboards put up).

For nearly all of the first 3 weeks that sign was in operation the
display itself was so screwed up one could not even read most of the
info on the billboard (looked like a TV with the horizontal sync bar
in the pix itself about 1/4 the way across from the right edge), not
to even mention the flashing and numerous dead "pixels".  Last weekend
(last time I was up that way) the sign seems to be working a bit
better, but still has a few glitches.

If this fellow is going to charge advertisers good money to display
their wares on his sign, he needs to make it a bit more reliable in
the basic sign sense. THEN he can work on the trick stuff.

I'd agree that 5ESS and DMS-100/200/250/500 offices are pretty boring.
However, if you can find a No. 1A ESS office or a No. 4 ESS office you
might find it a bit more interesting.  While these switches aren't as
fun to watch and hear as a Step-By-Step or a Crossbar, they're
sufficiently old enough to look interesting and not be in boring
cabinets for the most part.

The problem is finding one you can get into.  I've never been in a 1A
ESS office and they are getting harder and harder to find these days
(the LERG lists about 180, how many are still active is hard to say).
I've been lucky enough to tour a 4ESS office but that took being a
large AT&T customer and about half a year of begging.  And that was
pre-9/11.

So if you can find an older office, it's rather interesting.

Subject: A Christmas Carol


Did you ever have a Christmas/New Year's Week which stood out in your
memory years later; one that you remembered over the years as one of
your memories that would not go away for whatever reason?  I've had a
few such occassions, but for various reasons, the winter of 1982-83
stands out for me.

That was the winter that was horribly cold in Chicago. Christmas and
New Years came on Saturday that year. Beginning about December 22,
the temperature dropped below zero, and stayed below  zero until
Saturday, Christmas Day. In fact, overnight low temperatures on the
23rd of December and again on Christmas Eve reached an all-time low
in Chicago -- *minus 27* below zero; I am told it reached -31 in
Lincolnwood/Niles, north suburbs. More about that in a minute, but my
memory of that year began a day or two before, around December 21 if
my memory is correct. I know it was a Monday night. I had finished 
doing something in downtown Chicago, and walked over to the subway to
get a train to go back to my home. 

As luck would have it, as I went down the stairs to the track level,
I saw a train waiting there and ran the rest of the way down the 
stairs in order to get on. I got on, the doors did not close, and
the train just sat there. Getting off and looking up the track, I
saw there were actually three trains ahead of us, all sitting and 
waiting. I 'assumed' by walking ahead to the earlier trains I could
ultimatly get home earlier, so I walked ahead to the train in the
front of the line, waiting silently, then I discovered the problem. 
Someone, in the spirit of the holidays, had *jumped* in front of the
first train. The motorman and conductor of that train were standing
there, the motorman with a ghastly look of horror on his face and 
tears in his eyes. The conductor was telling him, "well, don't feel
so upset, the dude was not doing it on account of you. He could have
chosen anyone." 

Looking down at the track, I saw a broken, very dismembered human
being. The individual on the tracks was wearing high heel shoes,
and a wig, but obviously a male, I suppose with some unresolved issues
in his troubled life. Up at the agent's booth, I saw two police 
officers approach the escalator which was running 'up'; one of the
cops took a key out his pocket, put it in the key switch and the
escalator immediatly switched gears and started running 'down'. The
police officers rode down in silence, bringing along with them a
'body bag' sort of thing. At the track level, one of the cops said
"did you get them to kill the power yet?" and the conductor talked
in his radio to someone (probably the Belmont tower) and within a
second or two, an annoucement came over the public address system
saying "power is off in the subway for a few minutes." You could
hear the hum of the train motors go silent, and see the overhead
lights in the train cars go off. Within a half second or so, the
batteries on each train kicked on and the car lights went back on,
powered by batteries. Although some people continued to sit in 
their seats on the train (no doubt pretending to read their news-
papers) most of the folks on board took advantage of this unscheduled
stop to get off the train and have a quick cigarette. 

The two police officers simply climbed down on the tracks and
began their gruesome job. In two or three minutes they were back up
on the platform with their body bag and stretcher, heading over to
the escalator, still running 'downward'. The one cop asks the other
one, "is the wagon man waiting upstairs?" The other cop assured him
it was up there waiting, and jovially tells a riddle story to the
other cop:  "Do you know why the wagon men always smoke cigars?" When 
the other cop says he has no idea, the first one tells him, "well,
that's because they want to kill the odor and stench in the back of
the wagon from the drunks they haul in."  Both cops get a big laugh 
out of that. Using the key switch once again, the cop starts the
escalator running 'upward' again, and with a jerk as it starts going
up, the one cop pushes the stretcher and cargo on it. "Be careful
going up; that stretcher got bumped" said the other cop. The first
cop replied, " I don't think the client will know the difference",
and they both laughed again and disappeared upward to the agent's
booth where they had come from. 

At track level, the conductor (who had more or less taken charge
of the scene; the motorman was still a nervous wreck by what had
happened), talked into his radio and a few seconds later the public
address system started talking again:  "At the count of ten, power
will be restored in the subway; leave the tracks now; ten -- nine --
eight -- seven --" (and backwards to zero), then after saying 'zero'
he said, "I repeat, power is being restored, better get out of the
way". The conductor said something in his radio, and we heard the
soft hum of the motors as they turned on and the lights in the train
went off of battery stand by and back on regular service. Passengers
began to crowd and push into the first train, even coming from a train
further back thinking they would get home now at last. By now there
were two more trains backed up there (five or six in total waiting)
all *mostly empty* except for the first train, which was crowded like
the poverbial can of sardines. Packed, standing/squeezing room only. 
The people who had stayed on the train during the entire affair
looked around smugly; they were the ones who still had seats, twice
or thrice as many of their fellow passengers were standing in the 
aisles or still trying to squeeze in the doorway, like frantic animals
anxious to get to their warm homes and supper. 

"All aboard, people, we are running twenty minutes late, step lively
please, I don't want to tell you twice", said the conductor, as 
people pushed each other out of the way to get on the train. 

The central dispatcher had forgotten he was still on the overhead
loud speaker; he *thought* he was talking on the telephone to the
conductor. Speaking (he thinks) to the conductor and motorman only on
the telephone in each car they use, dispatch says, "To clear things
up, train (number) run express to the end of the line at Howard. 
Conductor, repeat the annoucement to the passengers". No need for him
to say that, the passengers all heard it, and began storming back off
the train, like angry wasps whose nest had been molested. None the
less, the conductor, a true company man, repeated it in a feeble
voice through *his* loudspeaker to the passengers, 'this train will
run express to Howard ... Howard next stop' ... People who had been
sitting smugly had to get up, leave their seats and fight to get to
the door; their seats were not vacated two seconds until someone else
moved in. 

Now there is a huge crowd standing on the platform or moving toward
train number two ... the train at the front had pulled out. As to be
expected, the conductor on train two also chatted on the telephone
with dispatch, and soon came the announcement *he* would run express
to Howard Street also. Passengers who had fought and managed to get a
seat on train two had to get up and leave their seats again and find
the exit door.  The third and fourth trains in the backlog were
instructed to run express to some interim station, then the fifth or
sixth train (whichever one was the last, and in essence only a minute
or two late) ran normally. I *knew* what the routine would be by this
point and decided to sit on the bench there at track level and wait
it out. 

When the crowds waiting had thinned out by this point and all the
trains were back on schedule with intervals between them, along came
the station janitor, with his water hose and squee-jee mop. On the
radio, but to no one in particular, he mutters, "man on the tracks at
Randolph Street" and climbs down there. One would think no one had
heard him, but in fact the dispatcher on the radio did hear him and 
I suppose passed along the word over the telephone to train motormen
who would be along presently. The janitor hoses the blood and whatever
was left over from the 'incident' down the sewer there, uses his
squee-jee device to clean up a little there, then hastily gets back
up on the platform and dissappears. When the next train came through
a minute or so later, I took it home, but all the way home, I thought
about what had happened, and wondered what had been so painful to the
man that he had chosen to take the path he had. I still think about it
today sometimes. 

              ==================================

Three or four nights later was Christmas Eve. I had a part time job
as an audio/sound technician person for Chicago Temple, a rather 
grandiose, done in French provincial church downtown. They proposed
to continue their 137 year old (at that time) tradition of singing
Christmas Carols directly across the street from their building in
the Richard Daley Plaza area. They looked with much consternation as
the temperature got lower, and lower and lower the two days before
the evening of December 24. Finally, when it got to -27 degrees that
evening, a number of people said call it off, cancel it. But hardy
souls prevailed and said it *would go on as in the past*. No need to
break a tradition which had started in the 1840's and continued to
that year. The decision they reached was at 8:00 PM they would go
outside, across the street and sing *one stanza* of 'Hark the Herald
Angels Sing' then go back inside. I was outside in the cold a few
minutes longer than anyone else; I had to set up the tape recording
machine, and take it down and back inside. 

              ====================================


The next day was Christmas; some of my relatives came over for the
day to have dinner, etc. By mid-afternoon, the temperature had
actually climbed up to five degrees *above* zero. Poet Emily Dickinson
said one time that 'God gave us our relatives; thank God we can choose
our friends.' and never was there a truer message. The family all got
on the way back home by about 4 PM, and I set off to meet some friends
of mine that evening at Berghoff's Restaurant downtown. I took the
subway downtown, and got off at Adams Street, a main downtown area. 

As I came upstairs to the street level, the thing I noticed was the
entire intersection and for a block going west on Adams Street was
like a frozen lake of water. Over near the restaurant, I saw a truck
parked there which said on its side, 'City of Chicago, Water Distribution'
and next to it, a 'keep the city clean' trash can had been pulled
over, filled with lumber and trash, and set on fire. Two men were 
standing there at the fire, trying to stay warm. I found out they were
the supervisors of the men nearby who were in a *large, deep* hole in
the street; about fifteen feet deep, sort of wide. The two men who
were down there in the hole were wearing hip boots, and standing in
water which swirled around their legs. They had tools and were doing
some digging or replacing of pipe, I could not tell which. I was a 
bit fascinated by it and the supervisor noticed me there, and said
"would you like to work here?  I have a tool about the right size for
you," and he reached over to back of the truck. 

I assured him I was just watching, and asked him "How much do you pay
those guys?"  His answer was, "twenty dollars per hour, and this being
Christmas they get double-time pay from the City, and the union
requires that there be two men on the job for safety reasons." He
continued, "I guess this 'heat wave' we are having today caused the
problem. A main pipeline got frozen and broke, the City lost a million
gallons of water overnight last night." He called me 'governor'.
Very shyly, he reached inside his inside coat pocket and pulled out a
flask of whiskey. He took a swig, then handed it to his partner who
also drank deeply. Then he glanced at me, and offered the flask,
inviting me to join him and his partner there. I took a drink also,
and we stood there for a couple minutes more talking.

Then he said to me, "I want to show you something," and from the
inside of the back of their truck he pointed to a large glass jar 
filled with dollar bills and coins, etc. He continued, "our crew, and
some of the ladies in the office at Water Works have taken up a
collection; we use it every year to pay past due utility bills for
people in poor neighborhoods who are about to get service cut off.
Would you be interested in giving also?" Then he passed his flask
around again, and we all had another drink. I took a twenty dollar
bill from my purse and put it in his jar. He said, "I want to give 
you a Christmas present also," and he produced another jar with lots
of pin-on-your-coat buttons. One said, 'a resident of Chicago, and
proud of it' with  a little flag on it, another button had a flag and
said something like 'your water works because I work there.' or 
something to that effect. I took the 'resident of Chicago and proud
of it' button. 

He offered the flask again, but for me at least, the whiskey had
started lying to me, 'how good I feel and how warm I am' and I thought
it best to depart. I walked into Berghoff's restaurant where the
majority of the patrons were eating, blissfully unaware of the workmen
outside repairing the water pipe. Even my friends were a bit annoyed
because I was later than planned getting there.

So that was the Holiday Week twenty years ago for me.

Subject: Reconciling the CD Requests


On Wednesday, Joey Lindstrom and I exchanged *much* correspondence
regards the CD orders. There have been a large number of CDs sent
out, and in fact there were quite a few on Tuesday/Wednesday alone.

By now, *everyone* should have a CD who requested one, with the 
exception of people who *mailed in their requests via snail mail
up to around December 15*  or they will be arriving in the next
day or two in that 'gray area' between December 1 and 15. Mail gets
here when it gets here  although I tell Joey Lindstrom immediatly
on receipt of the mail.

Regards PayPal, orders received up to around December 20 *may* in fact
be there already, or certainly will arrive in a day or two. Basically,
any orders from anytime up to early/mid-December should be in your
hands. Anything before the Christmas mail rush.

The rest of the orders (such as the past few days) should be in your
hands if not by today or tomorrow then certainly by the fifth of the
month more or less. **Keep me posted on arrival/non-arrival, etc
please.**

Subject: Member-Accessible DSL in a Community Rec Center?
Date: Wed, 01 Jan 2003 14:11:54 -0800


We're thinking about trying to establish an elementary broadband
internet connection that could be accessed and shared by unit owners
inside the recreation center of a vacation townhouse community.  The
community has120 units total, but only a small fraction of these might
use the service.  One proposal is the following:

*  Obtain DSL (or maybe cable modem) service into the manager's private 
office in the rec center, thus having it available for routine use by 
the manager.

*  In addition, run one or a couple of Ethernet ports (or maybe wi-fi 
service) into the adjoining public area of the rec center, thereby 
allowing unit owners who have signed up with the association to bring 
over their laptops and connect to the same service (including during 
times when the manager's office is closed).

Expected total usage would be small, both by manager and owners. This
is a largely nonresidential community; vacationing owners would
probably only drop over occasionally to check mail on their home
accounts or do a bit of web surfing.

We'd like to keep the system simple (one DSL line, one ISP account, no
individual email addresses or accounts, no usage charges, and in
general minimal bookkeeping and record keeping at all levels).

At the same time we'd like to try to limit the public access to
authorized owners only (since they'll probably be chipping in to cover
the annual costs), and not have the public ports turn into a wide open
gateway for local teenagers or computer gamers.

Any ideas on these latter points?  Are there inexpensive DSL routers, 
switches, firewalls, or gateways that could store a small set of 
passwords (maybe 20 of them) for obtaining public access from the public 
ports through to the DSL line?

(I imagine this could all be done in software within the manager's 
computer, but he's not a computer jock and it's only an elderly PC; 
something independent of the manager's machine would be desirable.)

Any ideas appreciated.  Email cc of responses appreciated.

They do not spend enough time on it.  If the industry doesn't do it,
our enemies will.  Being someone who manages web sites and actual
servers for multiple companies (some large and some very small), I can
definitely guarantee you that hackers routinely try the Microsoft IIS
hacks to gain access to public servers.  I even have one obscure
domain name that maybe gets 15 hits a day on average, and at least 5
of those hits each day are people trying to run Windows commands by
exploiting potential security holes.  I have much more popular servers
that are continuously bombarbed with the same exact hack attempts.  It
is almost like there are a group of people on the Internet who are
running a crawler across the entire web using their own private search
engine to try and hack every site on the web.  If you are running
Microsoft IIS on the Internet, you had better make sure whoever is
managing your server is routinely watching and analyzing log files and
double-checking and triple-checking that their sites are not being
hacked: new directories and files appearing on your servers, etc.
I've seen some public web servers that hackers quietly turned into
public file servers to distribute files.

I live in Illinois and we have Ameritech for our local phone company.
My friend recently got one of those Panasonic 2.4 GHz phones with
caller id on it.  He did not order the service or anything, yet our
names and numbers are showing up on their phone.  Any idea why this
is?  Thanks.


JR

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Telco -- especially Ameritech -- does
not give anything for free. Telco -- especially Ameritech -- is notorious
about accounting and billing errors. Has your friend yet received any
bills at this new phone number?  If not, watch and see what the bill
reflects when it begins arriving each month. If he is already getting
bills on the number, and caller  ID is not one of the items on the
bill, then he should consider himself lucky, and hope that one of
their 'routine audits' from time to time does not eventually catch up
with the error. Needless to say, if he ever moves to new premises or
for any other reason invokes a service rep to look at and examine
his bill, his 'free ride' on caller ID may come to an end. If a
routine audit does eventually find the error, most telcos have a
policy of only back-billing for a year, and sometimes they wil write
it off and start fresh.

I had this happen to me about twenty years ago. I was living in a 
near-north side apartment hotel in Chicago with switchboard service
for the tenants. I ordered a private phone for my apartment. It took
a *full year* before Illinois Bell decided to start billing me for it.
And that was only because some damn phreak made a couple of phraud 
long distance calls which were coin-rated and they had to bill me. I
had what Bell referred to as 'unlimited extended call-pack' which
meant there were never any additional charges to anywhere in the old
area 312. I was *most careful* never to dial a long distance call on
that phone. Anyway, some phreak made a credit card call or somehow
billed my number. When the charges finally came through the accounting
department, no record of my number was found; the charges went into a
suspense ledger pending an investigator personally looking at the
charges and trying to figure them out. This time the investigator
dialed my number -- expecting to get an intercept, no such number
message -- but instead it rang open on my end (I was not at home),
so the investigator called the plant or central office and asked them
what they knew. He was told it had been in service for about a year,
and that apparently 'someone' had never sent the paperwork to the
accounting office; only to plant to get the number turned on. Lazy,
incompetent service reps!  The investigator saw to it the paperwork
got into accounting, and he personally back-billed me for service for
the eleven months the phone had been there to date. 

So you can never tell for sure about these things. Your friend may or
may not ever get a bill for the caller ID service. But better tell
him to not *ever* get into an argument with some smart-mouth service
rep who takes it on herself to review his service entirely.    PAT]

First, of course, no one's willing to push the true solution to this 
repeated problem, which is a rationalization of telco rates. In this day 
and age there's no jusitification for any sort of long distnace charges. 
(Well, aside from making money for the telcos).

Anyway, given those constraints, NYS's Attorney General did well.

Quoting from the press release:

	"Attorney General Eliot Spitzer today announced that his
office has reached an agreement with America Online, Inc. (AOL) and
Frontier Telephone Company of Rochester, Inc. (Frontier) to provide
$200,000 in refunds and credits to over 400 Rochester-area America On
Line (AOL) customers for long distance charges they incurred last
winter while using the Internet.

	http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2002/dec/dec30a_02.html

Oh, he's also got one describing a settlement in which the credit card 
company "First USA" will cut back, at least a bit, on sleaziness:

	"Attorney General Eliot Spitzer today announced a settlement
that will provide new protections against misleading telemarketing
campaigns for more than 53 million credit card holders.

	"First USA Bank N.A. - the largest issuer of Visa credit cards
- and also known as Bank One Delaware NA, has agreed to implement
broad reforms in its relationships with third-party vendors to ensure
that non-deceptive marketing campaigns are used in soliciting the
bank's credit card holders.  Specifically, under the agreement, First
USA must prohibit vendors from engaging in deceptive solicitations.

Most peculiar.  This happens a lot when there's an area code split,
software that automatically selects the number to call doesn't realize
that the user's area code has changed, so it selects the closest
number in the old area code.  In this case, it was a big problem
because Rochester to Buffalo is an expensive inter-LATA call.  If this
was what happened (and I suspect it was), it's 100% AOL's fault.

On the other hand, it's just barely possible that Frontier screwed up
the reprogramming of some of its switches so that calls dialed without
an area code were misrouted to Buffalo, so they figured it was cheaper
to pay to make the problem go away than fester in court for years
trying to make sense of mountains of logs and phone bills.

Supports my long-held  view that Do Not Call lists are a basically 
unworkable idea, for multiple reasons, beginning with the fact that 
enforcement ends up as an expensive, time-consuming, and  mostly 
hopeless burden on the callee.

I suggest the only realistic solution for this whole problem is 
legislation requiring that all telemarketing, etc., calls be made using 
Caller ID and carrying a distinctive area code set aside for this 
purpose.  Recipients could then easily protect themselves by filtering 
and rejecting such calls, before the phone ever rings.

(This won't ever be implemented, however -- *because it would work*.)

blatant disregard for 'do not call' requests on my two phone

letters from both parties regarding my addition to AT&T's 'do not

Check out the private citizen website http://www.privatecitizen.com
They have info available to sue telemarketers.  You may have to join
or pay for their book to get the info.  I signed up with them a couple
months ago and telemarketing calls have pretty much stopped here, I
was getting 10-12 "hang-up" calls a day before joining.  About a month
after joining they seem to have stopped.

Anyone know who the hell US Telecom is?  That is one outfit that I
have had trouble with in the recent past.  Whenever I ask for a copy
of their do not call policy I mysteriously get cut off.  They seem to
have stopped calling about 3 weeks ago as well, so maybe they are on
the list Private Citizen maintains.

Verizon uses nice simplistic names for switches here in RI. 

PRVDRIWA is the switch on Washington Street in downtown Providence. 
PRVDRIBR is the swtich on Broad Street on the southern side of the city. 
NPRVRIMS is the switch on Mineral Spring Avenue in North Providence. 
EPRVRINB is the swtich on North Broadway in East Providence.

For those not familiar with the Chicago transit system, this may
sound a bit odd -- as though Pat was walking through the tunnel
between stations.  Actually, there are two subway lines in the city
center that each have a *continuous* platform alongside the tracks
for about 3,000 feet.  Normally each train makes 3 or 4 stops along
this section.

This arrangement gives the CTA maximum flexibility: street entrances
can be located all along the section, independent of the actual stops,
and the number of stops can even be changed if they think it desirable.

Thanks for the stories, Pat.

PUBLIC INTEREST REGISTRY ASSUMES CONTROL OF .ORG DOMAIN NAME REGISTRY
IN HISTORIC TRANSITION Largest domain redelegation in the history of
the Internet commences

Reston, VA - January 2, 2003 - The Public Interest Registry (PIR)
today announced that it has assumed the role of registry operator for
the .ORG top-level domain in a smooth handoff from former operator
VeriSign Global Registry Services.  This historic transition, which
commenced yesterday when PIR officially assumed control of registry
operations, marks the beginning of the largest transfer of data from
one registry to another in the history of the Internet.

"We are pleased to begin the transition process," said David Maher,
chairman of the PIR board.  "We have put together a solid transition
team and are working together toward a smooth, stable transition
resulting in no interruption of service for .ORG registrants."

In order to minimize disruption, a 25-day phase-in period has begun
during which VeriSign will still provide back-end technical services.
This will allow those that sell .ORG domain names more time to prepare
for the transition.  On January 25, 2003, the technical services for
the registry will be cutover from VeriSign to Afilias Limited, PIR's
chosen back-end service provider.

The .ORG domain, which has come to be associated with noncommercial
organizations, is the Internet's fifth largest top-level domain,
housing over 2.4 million domain names worldwide.  PIR was created to
manage the .ORG registry by the Internet Society (ISOC), and is
committed to setting a new standard for registry services in its
management of .ORG that will meet the unique needs and interests of
noncommercial organizations around the world.

Earlier this year, the Board of Directors of the Internet Corporation
for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) selected ISOC's proposal from
among 11 organizations bidding to operate the .ORG top-level domain.
VeriSign's contract as registry operator for .ORG expired on December
31, 2002.  As such, it is relinquishing .ORG to comply with an
agreement entered into with the ICANN and the U.S. Department of
Commerce in May 2001.

ABOUT PIR

Public Interest Registry (www.PIR.org) is a not-for-profit corporation
created to manage the .ORG domain.  PIR's mission is to manage the
.ORG domain in a way that supports the continuing evolution of the
Internet as a research, education and communications infrastructure,
and educates and empowers the noncommercial community to most
effectively utilize the Internet.  PIR is based in Reston, VA.

PIR was created by the Internet Society (www.ISOC.org).  ISOC is a
not-for-profit, open membership organization founded in 1991 and is
dedicated to ensuring the open evolution, development and use of the
Internet for the benefit of all people.  It provides leadership in
addressing issues that confront the future of the Internet, and is the
organizational home for the groups responsible for Internet
infrastructure standards.

In the early days of the ARPAnet we at BBN were doing a lot of
business with the engineers at various long-lines facilities,
particularly in Boston at the AT&T Boston-5 test board.  My colleague
and I were interested in getting a tour of the workings, and went to
the guy who was more or less our liaison to AT&T (this was Bob Kahn)
to see if he could arrange something.  He suggested that my colleague
and I should just talk to our pals at Boston-5 directly and not
involve any higher-ups in either company.  The head engineer there
agreed, provided we would also show them what we were doing too (the
idea of being able to remotely monitor and test fifteen independent
wideband lines all around the country from one place in Cambridge was
completely new and bewildering to them in 1970-71).

We got a great tour, and they had a good time too.

Hmmm.  And now Verizon probably owns the building that Boston-5 was
in, though not of course that long-lines operation, and BBN is part of
Verizon.  Who'd 'a' thought?

It worked for me on my phone in New Hampshire once or twice.

In Arizona, where coverage was much sparser, I was still able to connect
to services.  However Sprint at the time did not have roaming contracts
where I was (and there were and are lots of places where Sprint had no
coverage).  Connecting to services meant that I could have dialed 911 if
I'd needed to; but when I tried to call a real number, it denied me the
privilege or, in another case offered to let me key in a credit card
number (which I didn't try as I didn't have time and it wasn't so
important anyhow).  So it's either your phone or your region that's the
problem.

[I've since dropped Sprint, partly because I needed a new phone and
someone else had good cheaper phones and at least equivalent plans (I
think Sprint would have modified my plan nicely to retain me if I'd given
them the chance), and more important, my home location, which is marginal
on Sprint, was known to me to have better coverage on the new service.]

These are what are known as CLLI codes (Common Language Location
Identifier).  The codes above refer to the building that the switch is
in.  The switch itself will have a CLLI code such as PRVDRIWADS2.
PRVD is the city, RI the state, WA the building code, DS2 the
equipment or location within that building (I've seen where cages
within a datacenter have their own code as opposed to incidental
equipment in that cage).

So for instance at the PRVDRIWA office these are some of the codes in
use:

PRVDRIWA06T	DMS-200 Tandem
PRVDRIWA23W	No. 2 STP
PRVDRIWADS2	DMS-100 Local switch

There's others as well since most equipment in a CO will have a CLLI
code.  The last three alphanumerics can give an indication to the
general type of equipment.  nnT is often a tandem.  nnW is often a STP
or SCP.  DSn is a digital switch.  CGn is a non-digital electronic
switch (1A ESS for instance, stands for Control Group).  RSn is a
digital remote switch.  CMn is a Cellular Mobile switch.  You'll
rarely see them, but SGn was used for Step switches (Selector Group)
and MGx for Crossbars (Marker Group).

Some carriers (AT&T for instance) combine CLLI codes to create Trunk
Group identifiers.  So for instance the wonderfully cryptic
SNJSCA0241TSNTDCABXN021701 indicates:

A Location: SNJSCA0241T (San Jose, CA 4ESS)
Z Location: SNTDCABXN02 (Santa Clara, CA datacenter cage)
1701: BTFN (Base Traffic Number) of the Trunk Group on that 4ESS

CLLI codes are managed by Telcordia.  They also allocate CLEI
(Equipment Identifier) codes, CLFI (Facility Identifier) codes, CLCI
(Circuit Identifier) codes, and other various codes.

Mozilla (downloadable from www.mozilla.org) now allows you to
categorically disable pop-up windows.
Preferences->Advanced->Scripts&Windows has a check-box to enable
unrequested windows. By un-checking this, all JavaScript pop-ups are
gone. This is distinct from links that open a new window when you
click them. These are windows you're [implicitly] requesting; spammers
don't use this feature. Mozilla has a check-box to disable these
windows, but I see no reason to disable them.

Mozilla also has another option to change the behavior of animations
to running only once or not at all. This kills the banner
advertisements where the advertisements suck processor resources
infinitely cycling through color maps or "vibrating" the
advertisement. And you apparently stop winning the "If this box is
flashing, you're a winner!!!" advertisements. ;-)

Running with these two features has dramatically altered my browsing
experience. I forget how hostile the web is until I use a computer
that isn't configured this way.

Netscape 7, based on Mozilla, also has both of these features
available. However, they do not have the the check-box to disable the
opening of unrequested windows. Fortunately, you can still add the
preference by just adding the line:

user_pref("dom.disable_open_during_load", true);

to your user.js or prefs.js. On windows machines, this file is in a
hidden directory and it must be edited when Netscape 7 is not running.
The site http://techaholic.net/ns7.html is a good resource for info
about Mozilla/Netscape 7.

Categorically disabling pop-ups will break some sites that use them
for non-advertising purposes. My guess is that such sites will rapidly
abandon this Javascript feature precisely because users are turning
them off. If you still use sites that use pop-ups, you can run with
Mozilla and turn the feature on as you need it.

There is one "digital divide": households that have Internet access
vs. households that don't. Some point to a second divide: high-speed
digital access vs. dial-up access. I think there's a third divide that
may be more important than the second: users who know how to take
effective countermeasures against unsolicited commercial intrusions
(e.g. unsolicited commercial email, pop-up advertising, etc.) and
those who don't.

Yes -- This happens to us too; many times a day, almost exactly the same
commands are tried, and they always fail.  (Microsoft's IIS Lockdown Kit
with URLSCAN does its job.)  My understanding is that we are actually
looking at viruses doing the probing automatically.  What they'd do if they

I had that feature in a house where three people were sharing a phone.
Technically, it is an annoyance, as you now get to hear, not only the call
waiting tone, but apparently the caller ID burst of modem data.
Nice feature, bad implementation.

   telephone parts/supplies service based in the Chicago area has
   been widely recognized by Digest readers as a reliable and very
   inexpensive source of telecom-related equipment. Please request
