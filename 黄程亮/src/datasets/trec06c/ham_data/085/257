   Your problem isn't jogging my memory but you should probably make sure 
you're using the latest version of DMDX, that code underwent multiple 
recent upheavals to deal with broken sound card drivers.  You might try 
initializing the DigitalVOX before the RecordVocal device, you might try 
just the DigitalVOX without the RecordVocal device (! is handy for that 
sort of thing, you can just momentarily turn a keyword into a comment, <!id 
RecordVocal> for instance).  You might try passing RecordVocal a parameter 
and not run it in legacy mode, for instance <id RecordVocal 500> will 
record until 500ms past the VOX trigger.
