Greetings,

I went and fixed the problem, hope you don't mind :-)

The path to libGui.so was in /etc/ld.so.conf as it should be, but wasn't
in /etc/ld.so.cache.

The solution was to run ldconfig -v as root so that the linker would know
about the library at run time.

The clue was running ldd ~gilfoyle/eod/root/gpg_linux.old (found using
locate gpg_root) and seeing that ldd didn't know where libGui.so lived.

As long as the library directory is in the shared filespace (that is,
under /usr anywhere), is listed in ld.so.conf, and ldconfig has been run,
it will be found. The solution to the last problem was that I made
anything under /usr an O.K. place for libraries.

G'day,
sjames
