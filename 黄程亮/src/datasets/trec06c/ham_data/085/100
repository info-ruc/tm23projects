If your antimatter tank is the size of a bell jar, then it won't hold
enough antimatter to get anything bigger than about the size of a bell
jar to even low relativistic speeds.

Essentially, boosting a ship to a decent relativistic speed
(which I'll call > 0.5 c for purposes of this discussion) requires
additional energy input of approximately the initial rest energy of the
payload.  That means that a relativistic ship needs at least as much
antimatter + reaction mass as payload mass to reach relativistic speeds.

The situation with fusion power is worse, but in some ways not too much
worse; there you need something like a 1,000,000 :: 1 ratio of fusion
fuel :: payload.  That's a lot of fuel, but it's much easier to store
that much hydrogen than it is to store the much smaller amount of
antimatter in the case above.

Unfortunately ramscoops don't help the fusion situation much since
scooping up interstellar gas for fuel induces drag proportional to the
speed of the ship through the interstellar medium, which quickly matches
the thrust you get from fusing the fuel.  The expected top speed for a
traditional ramscoop ends up being something on the order of 0.1 c,
maybe a bit better if you do some other clever things.

I keep intending to put together a sort of breezy summary of the various
interstellar travel scenarios that have been considered and their
various tradeoffs, partly to get some newer list members up to date, but
mainly in the hopes it will revive active discussion on the list.

There are no true anti-matter storage containers yet. (There aren't any
anti-atoms to store in one if we had one.) Scientists are still
experimenting with various methods of containing anti-atoms (anti-matter).
Unless the atom carries a charge (an anti-ion), there does not seem to be a
simple way to isolate the atom from contact normal matter.

Current anti-matter storage vessels are called Penning Traps. They are about
the size of a small hot water heater. They are transportable and can carry
sufficient numbers of anti-protons for research and medical usage. Note that
these store only anti-particles, anti-protons to be exact.


In the last few months, several different researchers have claimed to have
created anti-atoms and their evidence to support their claims is being
evaluated by the scientific community. The jury is still out.

At the moment, the front runners in  the deep space reaction engine market
appear to be VASIMR and ACMF. VASIMR is basically a microwave pumped plasma
engine, ACMF stands for Anti-proton Catalyzed Micro Fusion. True fusion
rockets will probably never be used, the performance stats for ACMF are
better than the theoretical performance of fusion engines if we ever figure
out how to make one. It is expected that ACMF will lead to development of a
true anti-matter drive in a few decades.
