Hi,

does anyone know how to create an Item-File with ITI´s/ISI´s by chance?

One Trial consists of two stimuli. They are presented one after another.
I am interested in the RT to the second stimulus. 
The ISI should be between 1000 and 1500 ms by chance. Besides I want to 
vary the ITI within a determined range, too. 

Maby I have overlooked a relevant Keyword / combination of Keywords.
If not, maybe someone has a solution to this, using Excel.

Please help me,
Markus.
