Hawaiian Sovereignty: Feasible or Not?

       In my eyes, Hawaii has always seemed like the perfect state: beautifu=
l=20
scenery, tropical weather and, the one that sticks out the most, harmony=20
between everyone.  All races and cultures here ban together to form this=20
group we call "local."  Thus, various forms of competing identities here in=20
the islands can be best described as being pan-ethical.  Although even us=20
"locals" do not really know exactly what being local entails, there is a=20
general belief that if you have been living in the islands for quite some=20
time and have adapted the islands' norms, then you are local.  In addition,=20
because of the plantation era, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, Filipino, etc.=
=20
had to find common grounds and come together to withstand the harsh treatmen=
t=20
by the plantation owners.  Thus, identity in Hawaii is circumstantial, not=20
primordial.  However, the issue of Hawaiian Sovereignty has been in the mind=
s=20
of the people of Hawaii even before the plantation era, for over more than=20
one hundred years.  Since the overthrow (1893) of the last monarch, Queen=20
Liliuokalani, the Hawaiian people have been seeking retribution.  With=20
marches, lawsuits, and disobediences by our own government officials, this=20
social movement is the most controversial issue of the islands.  With this=20
social movement, along with collective action, the idea of non-Hawaiians,=20
even "locals," being forced out is an issued raised by many residing people=20
in Hawaii.  Because of modernity, blanketed by the power of the global=20
context of the economical status of Hawaii, it is going to be very hard for=20
Hawaii to become sovereign.  There are so many different ethnicities in=20
Hawaii that it will be hard for the indigenous people to gain the support=20
needed to reclaim the islands.  Also, Hawaii has become too dependent on the=
=20
US and its technologies to just sever itself from them.  Thus, I believe tha=
t=20
Hawaiian sovereignty is just not feasible.
       In the context of global economy, Hawaii's economy today has been in=20=
a=20
downward spiral for some time now.  With the depleting interest in=20
agriculture, the growth of the international labor market and the chronic=20
dependency Hawaii has had on tourism, the economy has made life here too=20
difficult and expensive.  With the closing of the Waialua Sugar Co., the las=
t=20
major sugar plantation in the islands, I fear that the interest in=20
agriculture will totally come to an end.  Even with the new developments and=
=20
ideas to use the land for diversified farming, will it really be so=20
significant that it will take some of the "heat" off tourism and diversify=20
the economy?  I think not.  Yes, Hawaii does have other means of agriculture=
=20
and other venues of businesses, but they are not as influential or prominent=
=20
as tourism.  If government, or maybe even the US, can somehow figure out how=
=20
to make these significant venues (i.e. advances in research by the Universit=
y=20
of Hawaii, the interest in Hawaii's geology, etc.) as beneficial to our=20
economy as tourism is, then I believe that Hawaii would not be such a bad=20
place to live (economically).  And yes, it is also true that Hawaii has=20
become commercialized in a way that it exploits Hawaiian culture because of=20
tourism, but there are other ways in which the native Hawaiians can=20
perpetuate their culture.  Such examples, like those in Ira Rohter's A Green=
=20
Economy for Hawaii, may include, but not limited to, are homegrown tours,=20
plantation villages (not like PCC), arts, etc.  Hawaii can hire native=20
Hawaiians to lead these proceedings, like hiking on homegrown tours, to teac=
h=20
others, especially tourists, about the history of Hawaii.  Thus the relevanc=
e=20
that global economy plays a part in the feasibility of the Hawaiian sovereig
nty movement; Hawaii can move along with modernity and globalization, withou=
t=20
having to force non-Hawaiians out, if we just find ways to perpetuate the=20
culture through things like the economic suggestions I mentioned above.  Thi=
s=20
way, native Hawaiians somewhat "reclaim" the land and culture, while people=20
of non-Hawaiian backgrounds can still reside here and enjoy it also.  If the=
=20
native people gain full independence, how will Hawaii survive economically?=20=
=20
Since it is the pacific hub of the global economy, it is crucial that Hawaii=
=20
have an economically superior country to back it up, for example, the US. =20
Also, the US has many economic ties with many other countries, for example,=20
with free trade, multinational corporations, and the growth of the=20
international labor market.  I would predict that Hawaii's economy would not=
=20
do so well without the help of the US, thus sovereignty would be very=20
doubtful for Hawaii's future.
       Identity has also be a longstanding issue in Hawaii as well as in the=
=20
Hawaiian Sovereignty movement.  In Lee Cataluna's article, "Who's more=20
Hawaiian is now a question of power," many questions were raised that I neve=
r=20
really thought about.  I, too, agree that since people have different=20
definitions no one actually knows if they themselves are local or Hawaiian.=20=
=20
"Who's Hawaiian? Who's more Hawaiian than Hawaiian?  Who's not Hawaiian=20
enough?  Should an Asian or Haole person, who has lived in the islands for=20
decades, be considered Hawaiian?  Who is entitled to what 'benefits?'"  All=20
of these are the questions that are all thought about, but never really=20
discussed.  Perhaps, if people actually came to a compromise as to whom is=20
Hawaiian or what local is, it would not be as controversial as many people=20
put it to be.  In an interview with Lyndon Suzawa, a 38-year-old Electrical=20
technician who was born and raised in Oahu's very own Kaimuki, I gathered=20
that he, a person of Japanese decent only, knew a great deal of things about=
=20
the Hawaiian culture.  "Yeah, I used to dance hula, boogie board, everything=
.=20
 I even used to cut school just so I could paddle canoe!"  Lyndon also said=20
(on a more serious note) that he disagrees with the sovereignty movement. =20
"If we leave the security of the US, Hawaii would become prone to attacks of=
=20
war for ownership.  Hawaii's geography is very important to the surrounding=20
Pacific islands and countries, and there is no way that Hawaii can escape=20
that."  So where does Lyndon fall?  Although he is 100% Japanese, it seems=20
that he has adapted to norms and customs of Hawaiian people.  In another=20
interview, with my father, Totchie Genciana, a 53-year-old butcher and=20
manager of the meat department of The Waianae Store, I found another person'=
s=20
opinion against the idea of sovereignty.  My father argues that although he=20
emigrated from the Philippines, he has lived here for almost 30 years and ha=
s=20
adapted the norms of the Hawaiian culture as well.  "I speak pidgin, I know=20
how to cook laulau, and I have many friends of Hawaiian ancestry - how much=20
more local can I get?!  It's not fair that people who have lived here their=20
entire lives may have to move just because they have no Hawaiian in their=20
blood, while those who have 1/16th of Hawaiian or know nothing of their own=20
culture gets to stay."  With opinions like these we can see that the support=
=20
for sovereignty is just not there.  So what would happen to Lyndon and my=20
father if sovereignty would take place?  According to Anthony Castanha's The=
=20
Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement: Roles of and Impacts on Non-Hawaiians, the=20
most beneficial models of sovereignty are free association and full=20
independence.  Citizenship, home, land and business ownership and other=20
benefits are at least obtainable in these models.  But what if Hawaii=20
undergoes the models of state-within-a-state or nation-within-a-nation? =20
Hawaii is too dependent on other cultures besides it's native to put=20
limitations on non-Hawaiians' citizenship, home, land and business ownership=
,=20
and leadership postions.  By putting limitations, those of non-Hawaiian=20
ancestry, even if they may be "local," may want to leave the islands on thei=
r=20
own free will.  This means more "brain-drain" episodes, loss of consumers as=
=20
well as support.
       Before Governor Waihe'e's monumental act of raising the Hawaiian flag=
=20
over the state capitol on the one-hundredth anniversary of the overthrow, it=
=20
seems to me that no one cared so deeply as they do now about sovereignty. =20
Only after this act, as well as the resolution signed by former president=20
Bill Clinton that stated apology to the Hawaiians for the overthrow, that=20
people took an active stand for sovereignty.  Thus, I believe that this=20
social movement is a result of Social Contagion.  One person, Waihe'e, acted=
=20
out his opinions on sovereignty, thus creating a chain of mass frenzy in the=
=20
islands.  People immediately imitated one another, passing on this frenzy an=
d=20
anger by word of mouth.  Social Contagion allowed the up rise of supporters=20
for Hawaiian sovereignty, making it very controversial.  In addition, since=20
knowledge of the similar situations of Native Alaskans and American Indians=20
is familiar with the people of Hawaii, Relative Deprivation comes into play.=
 =20
This social movement is brought on by the feeling that the land, government,=
=20
and rights have been taken away from the people indigenous to Hawaii  - just=
=20
as the Native American Indians.  Because Hawaiians know this, made more awar=
e=20
of their deprivation, they are more discontented with the current situation=20
of being a part of the Union.  Also, since Alaskans too have a special trust=
=20
with the US and is allowed to somewhat run their own affairs, Hawaiians seek=
=20
to have the same allowances as they do.  Moreover, the internal dynamics of=20
the group (Rational Choice Theory) have also played a key role in the slow=20
growth of the production of this social movement.  Many of the native=20
Hawaiians are pro-sovereignty.  However, many have different views as to wha=
t=20
extent demonstrations can make a true difference or progress in the movement=
=20
towards independence or nation-within-a-nation.  While Billy Pa, surf=20
instructor in Waikiki, wants only "=E2=80=A6Hawaii for Hawaiians," Elaine Ka=
opuiki=20
understands "=E2=80=A6that the big entities, the corporations=E2=80=A6should=
 return the=20
lands to the Hawaiian people. And the land in the hands of the state should=20
go back to the people."  Many people have even more differing view on this=20
issue, thus implementing the Rational Choice Theory.  This leads to the=20
Collective Action Problem: free riders that support the cause, but do not=20
work toward that cause.  This shows that it is another contributor to the=20
slowing down of the growth of the movement.  A last theory on social=20
movements is Resource Mobilization.  This pertains to this social movement=20
because many resources and opportunities for people to rally for this cause=20
are existent.  These four theories are relevant to my thesis because althoug=
h=20
they do explain the creation of the sovereignty movement in Hawaii well, the=
y=20
do not show the benefits or effects of sovereignty.  The Hawaiian people com=
e=20
together (social contagion, relative deprivation) to rally this cause=20
(rational choice, resource mobilization), but do not think about the effects=
.=20
 The thought of just being a sovereign place, where the land and government=20
are restored to its native owners are the only thoughts in the front of=20
activists' minds.  Thus my belief that sovereignty in Hawaii is just not=20
feasible; activists need to think of the economical, social and political=20
issues at hand.
       Hawaiian sovereignty is an issue that is very difficult to decipher=20
and solve.  One hundred years in the making, this social movement is still=20
growing and seems to be having a great effect on Hawaii's society.  Also,=20
along with Social Contagion, Relative Deprivation, Resource Mobilization and=
=20
Rational Choice, this social movement is the most controversial thing in the=
=20
islands next to same-sex marriages.  With the idea of who's local and who's=20
not, the issue of residing here in Hawaii is a major problem that comes alon=
g=20
with this social movement.  Although I believe that no definition should be=20
set in stone, one helpful suggestion as to how the people can decide on who'=
s=20
local or not (to see who gets what rights) is to come to a consensus as to=20
what being local entails.  All in all, I believe that Hawaii will never be=20
able to become a sovereign land if thoughts of the roles and impacts on=20
non-Hawaiians are kept at the back burner of the mind.
