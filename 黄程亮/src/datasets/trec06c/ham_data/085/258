Hi...

I'm using (attempting to use) DMDX in such a manner that a bitmap image is
displayed behind the text for a frame.  Once the user has made a response,
the following frame is an avi file.  The image just happens to be the first
frame of the video because I want the whole thing to seem like an animation.

However, there is a gap (of blank screen) before the video frame is played.
What (anything) can be done to alleviate this?  Note that there are no blank
screen between frames just containing the image and text.  I tried
preloading the video with a dud item & MediaLife but that didn't make a
difference.

Could an image be set as the background for all frames perhaps?

Any help would be appreciated,
Rua.
