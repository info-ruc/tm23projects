Gender & Interpersonal Relationships

=20

            Differences between the characteristics of men and women =
have existed since the beginning of time.  Interpersonal relationships =
are necessary in virtually all aspects of life; there are the =
professional, family, and romantic, just to name a few.  It is human =
nature to have relationships with other humans; it fulfills a large =
range of physical and psychological needs.  Aspects that are sometimes =
seen to dictate interpersonal relationships are physical attractiveness, =
proximity, familiarity, and similarity.  Physical attractiveness is the =
most apparent factor in determining how much a person is liked, which is =
funny, because it is also the least justifiable. This strong preference =
for attractive people deals with the stereotype that what is beautiful =
is good. Beautiful people are assumed to be more intelligent, =
interesting, successful, and so on, even if we have never met or talked =
to this person before.  Proximity plays an obvious role in =
relationships, because a relationship could never happen if people don't =
have access to one another.  Other things that affect relationships =
include familiarity (experiments have shown that we are more attracted =
to things we are familiar with) and similarity-which is important in =
that people with the same interests and views can relate to one another =
better and feel secure when their views are validated by someone else.  =
But communication is probably the most crucial factor in making or =
breaking relationships between genders.  Men and women have different =
discourse styles, and this often leads to problems in marriage, the =
workplace, and just about everything you can think of.  Men and women =
communicate so differently that they are sometimes referred to as coming =
from different planets (Men are from Mars, women are from Venus).  =
Communication differences are even thought to be the basis of the battle =
of the sexes.  Why does this difference between women and men exist?  =
How did feminine and masculine characteristics ever come about?  There =
are some who don't believe that gender specific characteristics exist at =
all.  However, to the vast majority of people, it is obvious that men =
and women generally have different characteristics.  While this could be =
attributed to biological differences, cultural differences play a bigger =
role.  I therefore do not think that men or women are confined to any =
specific role, they have the power of choice, but I do think they are =
inherently pushed toward one or another from the time of birth by =
factors like stereotypes and social environment.  =20

            The biological differences between men and women have from =
the beginning of time forced different types of social adaptations upon =
us.  This may be one reason why men and women formulated different =
discourse styles.  The explanation of social behavior using evolutionary =
principles is known as sociobiology.  From an evolutionary point of =
view, passing on as much of their genetic material is the goal of both =
males and females.  In order for men to have access to gain access to =
the most reproductive material, men needed to be aggressive to compete =
for women.  This is one way of explaining the aggressive nature of men =
which is prevalent in society today.  Women, on the other hand, needed =
to be more relationship oriented because they had the task of bearing =
and raising the child, which made it profitable to find a man who would =
stay with them and help with the tasks.  Could this be the reason for =
women's expertise in rapport talk (talk that sustains relationships) and =
metamessages indicative of intimacy? =20

            One theory of Deborah Tannen's that supports the view that =
differences in communication between sexes is a result of cultural =
upbringing is that from childhood, the glue of girls' friendships is =
talk, while for boys, it is doing activities.  Also, men are inherently =
aggressive, competitive, and their relationships are hierarchical.  So =
when women are put in this situation, they feel they are talked down to, =
and are insulted.  Men are just doing what they normally do with =
friends, but women tend to define levels of closeness by talking.  None =
of these practices are wrong, they are just different.  But when a woman =
wants to talk to her husband and validate their closeness, and he =
doesn't respond, it leads to a lot of problems.  Aside from having =
different ways of bonding, men and women also perceive the same messages =
to have different meanings. =20

            According to Deborah Tannen, women are more in tune to =
"metamessages," the level on which information about relationships is =
communicated, like closeness, while men are literal.  For example, a man =
fixes himself a snack, and when he is about to eat it, he notices his =
wife looks hurt.  When he asks what's wrong? She complains that he =
didn't offer her any.  Then the man says "I didn't know you were hungry. =
Here, have this."  But the woman refuses.  The man is confused because =
he looks at the snack as a matter of food, but the woman is concerned =
with the metamessage.  It's the thought that that counts, and if she =
were in his place, she would have thought about him when making the =
snack.  Dr. Cynthia Burggraf Torppa also thinks women are in tune to =
between the lines meanings, but she also goes on to say that women are =
more sensitive to messages about intimacy and men are more sensitive to =
meanings about status.  Society expects the woman to be the regulator of =
intimacy, and for this reason, women are more in tune to underlying =
meanings about intimacy in messages.  Society expects men to set a =
hierarchy and therefore, men are more sensitive to underlying meanings =
about status.  This complements Deborah Tannen's theory that different =
linguistic habits exist between men and women, much of which can be =
traced back to childhood, where little girls bond by talking or sharing =
secrets, and for boys, it is activities and competitiveness. =20

            This difference in the meaning of relationships between men =
and women from the time they were children (or even before that) plays a =
big role in personality development.  Girls and boys definitely grow up =
in different social environments, and this contributes to what kinds of =
traits they pick up.  For example, there are clear stereotypes to how a =
girl or boy should dress, act, do, etc.  When babies are born, girls are =
dressed in pink and boys in blue.  As toddlers, girls are given dolls to =
play house, and boys, things like trucks and footballs.  This stresses =
the stereotype that girls are supposed to be homemakers and dedicated to =
their family and boys should drive a manly car and play rugged sports.  =
Another thing is that girls are taught to express their emotions, while =
boys are taught to keep them in, and be tough.  Common phrases told to =
boys include "boys don't cry" and "be a man."  Society clearly has view =
of what is considered to be masculine and feminine, and inherently =
pushes each sex to be a certain way. =20

            These stereotypes often keep women from accomplishment in =
environments outside of the household.  These stereotypes also denounce =
the capability of women to perform tasks in areas where men dominate, =
such as in sports, politics and the workplace.  There are many women who =
resent this, and try to better this situation.  These women are =
organized into a group called feminists.  But even within feminists, =
these women have different views of what should be done concerning the =
situation of women's inequalities.  Libertarian feminism is the most =
conservative type of feminism.  They advocate equal opportunity and =
equal rights for women, and were most active in past decades, when they =
got several laws passed to help women.  They think that gender should =
disappear, because achievement is more important than ascription.  Women =
who were not satisfied with the views of libertarian feminists organized =
into liberal feminists.  They thought that laws passed to give women =
equal opportunities weren't doing the job, because many criteria (made =
by male supreriors) still discriminated against women.  Some examples of =
these are discriminating against women who take time off to have a child =
and rejecting them on the basis of physical strength, even if it has =
nothing to do with the job.  Therefore, liberals push the idea of equal =
outcomes.  Comparable worth is one thing that came about through the =
idea of equal outcomes.  Comparable worth tries to raise the pay for =
women who were doing work that required just as much skill as men, but =
getting paid less.  This happened to women who did women's work, like =
nursing, as well as those who worked in companies alongside men doing =
similar tasks.  Many people argued that comparable worth is unfair to =
employers.  According to "Comparable Worth in Theory and Practice," the =
financial burden of increasing pay for women will cause layoffs and tax =
increases.  However, the AFL-CIO shows that in states where pay equity =
was implemented, there were neither layoffs nor tax increases.  Also, =
equal pay increases are usually implemented over two to four years, =
lessening the financial impact on the employer.  Furthermore, continuing =
to pay women less costs money in terms of food stamps, and other things, =
because women are unable to support their families on the money they =
earn.  Still, there are women who opposed the liberal feminist view, the =
radical feminists.  They say that the system is inherently patriarchal =
and cannot be fixed, therefore, women need to separate and establish =
their own companies.  Radical feminists also think that comparable worth =
and other laws give the impression that women can't make it on their =
own, and therefore need the government to intervene and increase their =
pay.  However, the article by the AFL-CIO supports the opposite.  They =
show that the education of women has increased greatly (In 1979, about =
one in five women working full time had a college degree, and in 1998, =
nearly one in three women did.) but somehow, the closing of the gap in =
pay has actually slowed despite this increase in education for women.  =
It seems to me that women have been "making it" fine, and the ones who =
aren't "making it" are employers.  They have failed to produce a fair =
working environment for their employees.  I suppose this is how the =
theory of modernity fits; everyone is concerned for their own =
individualistic needs.  Employers want to maintain their wealth and =
power, and women want their share.  Neo feminists, the most recent =
group, have their own set of views.  They advocate equality with =
difference.  Their values came from psychology, that shows men and women =
have different values.  Men have a universal ethical code that applies =
to all situations, while women's values vary from relationship to =
relationship; they use emotion in making decisions.  They are also more =
caring and group oriented.  This tendency to associate different sets of =
values to each gender is called essentialism.  Neo feminists are accused =
by people like the liberal feminists of selling out and stereotyping.  =
However, neo feminists see feminine ethics as valuable to society.  They =
think that the incorporation of feminine values will contribute to =
society, and deviate true equality.  Neo feminism is the group most =
inclined to the theory of gender-based communication differences.  They =
also put a positive twist on having differences. =20

            In society, there are clearly more women who like pink than =
men, more women who cry than men, more men who like football more than =
women, etc.  Still, there are some people who don't think that gender =
stereotypes/and male/female characteristics exist.  This article from =
the psychology help website challenges the stereotype that women are =
more illogical than men.  It gives the example of a man walking through =
a messy kitchen with things all over the floor and dirty dishes in the =
sink.  He passes right by it and makes a cheese sandwich.  His wife =
notices this, and she thinks, "Of course he notices the dirty dishes, =
the overflowing garbage and the misplaced toys! He is just being =
difficult or he's trying to get back at me in some way by pretending not =
to notice. It seems I now have a choice either to do the chores myself =
or to confront him with his lack of sensitivity and caring, also his =
wrongness."  The man would probably come to the conclusion that his wife =
is illogical, because all he did was leave to make a snack and when he =
got back, she was chastising him.  However, in this case, the woman has =
acted most logically; she went through a thought process, feelings and =
beliefs, while the man didn't notice a thing except his hunger. =20

            My opinion is that culture largely influences men and women =
toward masculine and feminine traits, which includes their extreme =
difference in discourse styles.  Stereotypes do reflect some truth, =
after all, they are based on the majority.  They are just not always =
true.  There are exceptions to everything, like a female being a tomboy, =
and a male being what is locally known as a "mahu."  I also don't think =
that women and men are hopelessly bound to one stereotype or another; =
they can choose how they want to act or communicate, but these things =
are usually developed from childhood, so of course as long as society is =
the way it is, there will be more females who allow themselves to be =
emotional and chatty and more males who are competitive and aggressive.  =
The reason for this is that although choice for each sex exists, most of =
the time people can only choose from what they know, and that is what =
they have been taught by society; if they are raised a certain way, they =
will choose actions/beliefs among their set of morals and values.  As =
for communication differences, I think that since men and women are =
raised to be different, they will always exist.  But understanding our =
differences is the first step to working things out.  Everyone will =
never be able to agree on everything, but is that necessarily bad?  Even =
if communication differences, job discrimination, or gender altogether =
were to disappear, no matter what, people will always be different and =
furthermore, diversity is beautiful.  We should keep an open mind, =
consider, and incorporate new and different ideas into our life. =20
