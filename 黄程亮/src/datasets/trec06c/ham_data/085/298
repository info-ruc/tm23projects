   We've done it with the R-wave wired up to the request.  The only fly in 
the ointment is that DMDX is synchronized to the raster so any response it 
makes to an external stimulus is going to be delayed by anything up to a 
single retrace interval.  But that can be lowered to around 10ms on any 
modern machines.

   Looks like it's plain text to me, most impressive.
