Or, the goal itself is a dude?  We never settled America to settle America.  
We settled it to make money or such.  Thats not what advocates focus on.

NASA's job is spectacal and good press.

Yup.  They know its BS PR.  Space was a dead frounteer long before they were 
born, and they know it.

Now your thinking like NASA.  

The prime directive is to never do anything that looks bad!

None of these ae, or should be, relaed to NASA.

This is a myth.  Oil will last far far longerthen we will neede it to, and 
Earth is to rich in or to need asteroid matierial.  The refined materials 
cost less  per pounnd then any near term shiping costs of anything back from 
the asteroids.

The data showsthat you do not want to keep folks in lkow to zero G.  I.E. big 
wheeled statinos or not.  Whicjh does lesve anything for NASA to study -- and 
they live for endless studies!

Now your back in the NASA game.  We don't need to study this stuff.  Firms 
will do that for you IF YOU SUPPY A MARKET TO BUY THEM!!!

The Rocket entrepreneurs are kiding themselves.  TRying to start a aitline, 
by trying to backyard tinker a airliner - is a waste of time.  The areo 
companies know how to make cost effective, relyable, aero space craft -- and 
investors will trust their gear a lot more then one you make.  The areo 
companies just don't know how to run a air/space line profoitably.  THATS 
what the rocket entrepreneurs need to focus on and solve.  Problem is they 
are frustrated engineers who really would rather develop space craft.
