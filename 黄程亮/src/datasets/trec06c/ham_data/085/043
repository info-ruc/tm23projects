CERT Advisory CA-2002-32 Backdoor in Alcatel OmniSwitch AOS

   Original release date: November 21, 2002

   Source: CERT/CC, Alcatel

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Alcatel  OmniSwitch  7700/7800  switches running Alcatel Operating
       System (AOS) version 5.1.1

Overview

   Alcatel has recently discovered a serious vulnerability in AOS version
   5.1.1.   Exploitation   of   this   vulnerability  can  lead  to  full
   administrative control of the device running AOS.

I. Description

   AOS  typically  runs  on  network  infrastructure devices, such as the
   Alcatel OmniSwitch 7000 series switch. According to Alcatel:

     During an NMAP audit of the AOS 5.1.1 code that runs on the Alcatel
     OmniSwitch  7700/7800  LAN  switches,  it  was  determined a telnet
     server  was listening on TCP port number 6778. This was used during
     development to access the Wind River Vx-Works operating system. Due
     to  an  oversight,  this  access  was  not removed prior to product
     release.

   Further   information   about  this  vulnerability  may  be  found  in
   VU#181721. This issue is also being referenced as CAN-2002-1272:

     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1272

II. Impact

   An  attacker  can  gain  full access to any device running AOS version
   5.1.1,  which  can  result  in,  but  is  not limited to, unauthorized
   access,  unauthorized  monitoring,  information  leakage, or denial of
   service.

III. Solution

Upgrade to AOS 5.1.1.R02 or AOS 5.1.1.R03

   Contact Alcatel's customer support for the updated AOS.

Workarounds

   Block access to port 6778/TCP at your network perimeter.
