hi sasko,

   when you get a chance could you install bbftp on pscm1.
this package was, i think, installed before, but it looks like 
it may have been wiped out by the upgrade. we need this to 
transfer data from jlab to the cluster. there is a web-page at
jlab at the following address.

http://cc.jlab.org/docs/scicomp/how-to/off-site-data-transfers.html

more stuff here.

thanks-in-advance,

hi steven,

   i'm checking in (when there is no beam) to find out the
status of the cluster. have the library issues been resolved?
if so, what was the solution? i'm itching to let this thing
get cooking.

Jerry,

I installed bbftp client on pscm1. It can be accessed as
/usr/local/bin/bbftp.

Note also that the new cluster is running gcc-2.96 and not gcc-3.0.4 that we
had installed on the old one. 

Tell me when you are ready so I can roll out the new gcc.

Sasko

Greetings,

I believe I have all of the library issues dealt with.

I noticed a possably confusing behaviour that might have been the root of
some of this.

Perl depends on several libraries in /lib to run. Unlike those in
/usr/lib, they were being managed by caching rather than just being
available from NFS. It can take about a minute for the libs to be fetched
from the master. During that time, the app will appear hung, but will
eventually start.

I have pre-cached the files onto the node's local drive to try to avoid
that delay.

Since the libs are cached, once that startup penelty is paid, it doesn't
happen again for those libs on that node until reboot.

You can see this happen using tcpdump (I have a binary of it in my home
directory). The libs are transferred as a stream of multicast packets.

Please let me know if this gets it going. If problems remain, a good
approach might be for me to make a copy of your test data and try the runs
myself until the expected results come up.

G'day,
sjames
