=09When Americans hear the term =93sweatshop=94 they automatically as=
sume the=20
worst.  And if God forbid you think differently or you see the positi=
ve side=20
of the issue, you are rudely stared at, mocked behind your back, not =
to=20
mention that you will be labeled a heartless person that agrees with =
the=20
suppression of less fortunate countries.
=09According to Webster=92s Dictionary, the meaning of sweatshop is, =
=93A shop=20
where employees work long hours at low wages under poor working condi=
tions=94.=20
  In this essay we shall use this term to mean American owned factory=
=20
located in third world countries.  The conditions, wages, and working=
=20
conditions are not necessarily poor nor abusive.
=09When I started research on this topic, I realized that everywhere =
you turn=20
you find negative media advertising.  Even if the topic you search wa=
s=20
clearly =93Pros of Sweatshops=94, you find three links that are in fa=
ct pros=20
followed by 1,163 links about all the horrors and terrors that sweats=
hops=20
are.  Seems rather biased to me.  All of America sees all the negativ=
es on=20
the news.   Harvard students are screaming about the injustices.  But=
 I=20
don=92t see trendy American women complaining when they can buy that =
cute=20
blouse for eight dollars.
=09When I started reading about modernity and the theories related to=
 it, my=20
reaction was =93no no no we can=92t have this=94 I went as far as to =
believe to go=20
backward into traditional society then to go forward into modernity. =
 But=20
alas it is not possible, and the more we studied modernity, the less=
=20
horrible it seemed.  Then when the sweatshop issues came up, I felt=
=20
completely torn.  While I disagree with the modernity theory, I reali=
zed=20
that some sort of compromise must be reached not only between the glo=
bal=20
economies of the world but also within my own beliefs.
=09Firstly, the people that work at sweatshops are not being kept the=
re=20
against their will. It=92s not as if they were shanghaied and are bei=
ng held=20
at gun-point at these factories.  That would require a lot more worke=
rs now=20
wouldn=92t it?  These people, if they were not working in a factory, =
would be=20
working in fields, perhaps harder labor and poorer wages.
=09Sweatshops actually improve working conditions in third-world coun=
tries. =20
For example, women were working in fields in Malaysia could get up to=
 $180 a=20
month, however if they went to work for Motorola, they could get up t=
o $300=20
a month.  In addition, the women started to view themselves in a diff=
erent=20
light.  They decided that they wanted to get an education and go into=
=20
business.  They had the opportunity to escape their traditional socie=
ty,=20
which is patriarchal and ascriptive.
=09Next, if you think about the rules of economics, if there is a pro=
blem with=20
the economy, and it is affecting profits, then businesses will automa=
tically=20
correct themselves.  If these factories were really bad for the count=
ry=92s=20
economy, then proper steps would be taken  by the citizens, lawmakers=
 and=20
business men to fix it, or to make the factories more efficient.
=09Also, Americans think or perceive sweatshops as =93bad=94 because =
they are=20
comparing third world countries conditions to conditions in America, =
which=20
is a first world country.  I think it is rather arrogant that America=
ns have=20
this belief that every other country in the world wants to be exactly=
 like=20
the United States.  In fact, most countries are just fine and dandy=
=20
following their own culture, and keeping their own cultural tradition=
s.  It=20
is not the place of the people of America to correct the laws of othe=
r=20
countries.  If foreign third world countries find that their laws lea=
ve=20
something to be desired, then they themselves will correct them as pa=
rt of=20
the transition from traditional to a modern society.
=09Next, a lot of people who are against sweatshops complain about ho=
w big=20
business or corporate America abuse people in the factories.  But eve=
n if=20
these abuses are going on, the only reason it becomes possible is bec=
ause of=20
a lack of laws in that particular country.  This also means that if t=
here is=20
abuse going on in American owned factories abroad, the very same abus=
es are=20
going on in the rest of the country.  The laws are inefficient and, a=
s I=20
said before, it is not America=92s place to correct these laws, and w=
hen that=20
particular country is ready, they will restructure the laws and fix w=
hat is=20
wrong.
=09These factories give families, in poor countries, income.  This is=
 very=20
helpful because too many third world countries=92 or the primary sect=
ors of=20
economy have very large families.  Especially since the average wage =
of=20
these countries is so poor that most people can=92t afford proper med=
ical=20
attention or receive education on how to care for themselves. So many=
 of=20
these American companies are doing a favor for the people of this cou=
ntry. =20
They also improve the standard of living.  There=92s one case in Chin=
a where=20
the people, all rice farmers, were starving because the cost of rice =
was=20
very low.  Then came Company A and set up shop.  Workers signed a con=
tract,=20
meaning that they agreed to all the existing conditions, and then the=
y got=20
to work.  Company B came along because they saw how well Company A wa=
s=20
doing, they needed to compete with Company A so obviously the conditi=
ons, or=20
the pay, or the working hours had to be a lot better to lure the work=
ers or=20
attract the workers to come and work for them instead of working for =
Company=20
A.  In addition, the people who stayed in the fields also did better,=
 since=20
so many left to work in the factories, the price of rice went up, whi=
ch=20
meant that the standard of living for the rice farmers also improved.=
  This=20
proves that some factories have improved, and will most likely contin=
ue to=20
do so, the living conditions and lifestyles because of the presence o=
f the=20
so-called horrible sweatshops=20
(http://www.mcspotlight.org/cgi-bin/zv/debate/campaign/messages/479.h=
tml).
=09Sweatshops have actually improved the standard of living of Americ=
an=20
citizens... sort of?  Because people in third world traditional socie=
ties=20
are doing all the =93dirty work=94.  American people who rarely have =
to stoop=20
down to perform the intensive type of work that the people of third w=
orld=20
countries have to do in order to gain enough wages to survive in thei=
r harsh=20
world.  It goes along with the globalization theory that says that ea=
ch=20
country should produce what they are best at.  For example, you would=
 never=20
ask Japan to round up a bunch of laborers to produce a bunch of cheap=
=20
t-shirts with Hawaiian Pride logos slashed all over the front and bac=
k of=20
the loosely woven T-shirts.  On the other hand, you wouldn=92t even t=
ry to=20
round up a bunch of aspiring techies in Malaysia to try to produce hi=
gh -=20
quality standard computer hardware for the fanatical and obsessed you=
thful=20
population of America who is now enjoying the next video game craze. =
 Each=20
country should produce whatever is cheaper for that country.  Then ea=
ch=20
country trades all products that they have  made with one another.  I=
t would=20
be illogical for a country to spend extra money producing particular =
items=20
that are economically inconvenient because they lack the resources an=
d=20
technology to do it cheaper.
=09American buyers are hypocrites.  They complain and protest about t=
he=20
injustices all around the world, and the media has a lot to do with i=
t.  The=20
media screams and yells about all the =93bad=94 things but they fail =
to mention=20
all the positive aspects of the situation.  In addition, as I=92ve me=
ntioned=20
before, Americans protest but they see nothing wrong when they are ab=
le to=20
purchase an article of clothing for under $10 at their local departme=
nt=20
store.
=09Even if the situation has regressed to an unbearable state, the wo=
rkers=20
themselves will see to it that the working condition laws will be rev=
amped=20
as soon as possible.  They will protest, rebel, strike, do what ever =
is in=20
their power to change the working conditions until it is satisfactory=
 to=20
them.  If America is so arrogant to think that they like to be in a=
=20
situation that will harm them or their families then we, as a country=
,=20
insult their intelligence, third world jokes aside of course.
=09The debate of sweatshops is ongoing and sometimes the lines betwee=
n right=20
and wrong blur, as most moral issues tend to do.  But speaking from t=
he=20
position of a girl that grew up in a third world country, the benefit=
s of=20
sweatshops greatly outweighs the media -induced negative aspects of t=
his=20
issue.
