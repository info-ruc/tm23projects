On the board, look for a relatively large (physically) capacitor with
a voltage rating of 200 or greater, probably about 0.5 microfarad or 
so connected near the line jack.  Snip it out.

The beginnings of my company's business ran on VIC-20s (purchased in 
bulk from Toys-R-Us). Assembly-language programs were burned into eproms 
and run from the "game slot". In other words, we took over the whole 
machine.

I don't know about "thousands allocaton", but number portability is 
quite common. Customers with SBC numbers can have that number served by 
any SS7-connected CLEC. It doesn't have to fall into any particular 
block or have any particular prefix to be portable.

While we in the northern part of the state get eclipsed by SoCal, that
exact situation is just about upon us. San Jose and its environs is
currently encapsulated within 408. Several years ago, PacBell had an
overlay prepared and scheduled. The code was to be 669.

In an uproar, mainly fueled by the media and the press, the company
was forced to back down. By reclaiming numbers from CLECs, and by
going crazy with "informal" prefixes, the split was postponed.

Now the piper's bill is coming due, and the split will be required
soon.  This time, however, to avoid the wrath of the San Jose Mercury
News, the split will be geographical. The dividing line will pass
right through the city of San Jose, and in fact pass right down the
middle of one of the city's districts. Half the city will have to dial
those dreaded 11 digits to reach the other half ... after they figure
out where they are in relation to the person they are trying to
reach. With the overlay, it would always be clear.

You have to understand that in California, the media runs the show. If
the news business doesn't like something, you can forget it. Overlays
are the order of the day everywhere else because they make sense.

But not in California, apparently.

RIAA members don't sell MP3s. RIAA members are trying to keep customers 
from making their own, even from duly-purchased CDs. But ... customers 
WANT and (according to surveys) are willing to pay for authorized MP3s 
for use in computers and pocket players.

No, customers definitely DON'T want "secure" files that become
unplayable without a net connection (try playing those in the Gulf!).
No, customers don't want files that won't play on another computer
(computers fail) or won't play on a pocket player. But then, says the
RIAA, who cares what customers want?

Meanwhile, as Pat suggested in another post, the movie industry (you
know, the one who initially proclaimed the DVD to be the instrument of
their own death) is raking more money than it can count from DVD sales
and rentals. In fact, the DVD has been the salvation of many films
that were stinkers at the box. In addition, Hollywood has cashed in on
the "film restoration" bandwagon, where new life has been breathed
into films that were stagnant on the shelves.

Even George Lucas discovered that by releasing his sacred Star Wars
films in a timely manner on DVD, he made MORE money than by throwing a
fit about how HE was the one controlling everything and that he would
never release a film on video before HE was ready.

Over the years, I have been an avid CD and DVD collector. I have
thousands and thousands of CDs and about a thousand DVDs. However, I
have stopped buying CDs. Why? I refuse to buy a crippled product that
cannot be transported to my iPod, laptop, car player, or other
convenient listening devices. Ironically, I can readily play my DVDs
on my laptop; BMG says I'm no longer permitted to do that with CDs
that I purchase.

If you treat customers like criminals, ultimately those providing your
revenue will throw up their hands and walk away. At that point, all
the jack-booted copyright enforcement and all the copy-protection
technology in the universe will not save your bacon.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: John, when you talk about 'BMG' are
you referring to the company in Indianapolis, IN which operates all
the various 'clubs' for books, records, CDs, etc?  Years ago, they
also operated the 'RCA Victor Record Club', and the 'Talking Book
Society' with audio books for visually handicapped people. When I
volunteered my time at the Chicago Public Library with their radio
reading service for visually handicapped people (CRIS Radio) I had
a lot of trouble with getting them to give permission to use their
audio books on the library radio station. 

Regarding Hollywood and DVD sales, I think it is Warner Brothers which
now has some subsidiary set up to sell DVDs real cheap (for very old
[like 1930-40's movies], slightly more on more recent films) and you
are right; they are making a killing at it. Its not at all the death of
the industry they predicted. The death of movie theatres, perhaps, but
not the whole industry.  PAT]

The RIAA didn't take any computers.  The Navy took back *its own*
computers.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  That is open to dispute. *If* the
computers were the Navy's own property, then they had every right to
them. But, in the previous issue of the Digest this morning, it was
suggested that the computers were bought and paid for by the private
money of the sailors who were disciplined, and NOT the Navy's property.
I only know a few things from personal experience (civilian employment
at Fort Riley, Kansas in 1999) but there were a lot of personal and
private computers in the soldiers' barracks. And yes, there were also
a lot of laptops around that were government property. Which computers
precisely had the verbotin files? Files that should not have been on
the internet to begin with if their rightful owners do not believe in
sharing with other netters, but that is a moot point. Do you know?  PAT]

Subject: Treo Tweak Promises Turbo Access


By Richard Shim
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

Handspring is releasing a software upgrade in the United States that 
improves the e-mail and Web capabilities on its Treo devices, the 
company said Tuesday.

The update allows people with Treo models 180, 180g and 270 using 
T-Mobile cellular service to access GPRS (General Packet Radio 
Service) networks, which should provide improved e-mail and Web 
access. The new version is available free on the Handspring Web site, 
and T-Mobile plans to make it available for download on its Web site.

Handspring says it is working with Cingular to ensure that the update 
is compatible with that wireless carrier's GPRS network. The new 
software had already been made available to Treo owners in Europe and 
Asia.

Ummm ... I don't want to be able to playback messages from the
handset.  I want to be able to listen to them AS they are being
left. There's a difference. I know these phones exist, a relative has
one. I want a phone like this for my dad for Christmas. It must have
this feature along with a caller id and digital answering
machine. I've looked all over the place and I can't find anything
about these types of phones.  Doesn't anyone know anything?

paragraph again. You do what you want to do by waiting until the
very instant the answering machine picks up, then quickly and quietly

THE ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS UP, THEN CLICK AND GO IN ON THE LINE. Go
in a fraction of a minute too soon, the answering machine won't pick
up. Go a fraction of a minute too late; the answering machine has 
picked up and it excludes the handset. Have them enter the line at
the same time, the unit gets a bit confused over what to do with the
call and talks to both. That's not in the instruction book because
the company (Uniden) did not plan for that. And it won't work each 
and every time. Sometimes in its confusion, it simply hangs up the
line and won't speak at all. PAT]

I got hit with another home-based telemarketer machine yesterday. But
this one is fun: you can call the number and with only few tries get
in between calls. Once you are in, the machine squirts a burst of DTMF
in your ear (the next victim). All you have to do at that point is to
say "hello" and the machine delivers its spiel.

It ultimately asks you to leave your name and phone number. I'll leave
it to you what to say at that point. Then it hangs up. All you have to
do is wait a few seconds and the cycle repeats.

For your dining and dancing pleasure: 408 283-5258.

Companies That Billed Consumers for Adult "Videotext" Internet Services
Settle FTC Charges

Integretel, Inc. and eBillit, Inc. Must Investigate Consumer Complaints
About Unauthorized Billing; Will Release $1.6 Million in Previously
Collected Funds

[ snip ]

Once the dialer software was downloaded, it disconnected the
consumer's modem from its usual Internet service provider, dialed an
international phone number to Madagascar and reconnected the modem to
the Internet from some overseas location. The line subscribers then
began incurring charges on their phone lines for the remote Internet
connection at the rate of $3.99 per minute.

In its complaint, the FTC alleged that although VIL's bills, which
were mailed by the Integretel defendants, deceptively represented that
the calls reconnecting consumers modems to the Internet terminated in
Madagascar, in fact they were "short-stopped" in London or some other
location. Thus, line subscribers were charged the rates to Madagascar
at $3.99 per minute, compared to about $.08 per minute to London.

NEW YORK -- Unbridled greed proved the ultimate undoing of an 
identity theft crime ring that ripped off thousands of Americans, 
according to law enforcement officials.

The criminals' repeated data downloads coupled with escalating
consumer complaints eventually aroused curiosity at credit reporting
agencies, leading to the arrest of three men who officials said were
the primary perpetrators of the scam.

But at least 20 other people may have been involved in the two-year
swindle.

I'm assuming that the Naval Academy and the Air Force Academy work the
same way.  Although I don't have personal experience with USNA, I have
secondhand knowledge of USAFA's computer policy.

Five or more years ago, USAFA began requiring every incoming freshman
to buy a computer.  Since this is the military we're talking about, it
wasn't just "Buy a computer."  It was "You're required to buy a
computer.  This is the computer you are required to buy.  This is how
much it will cost you."  Then they issued the computer to the cadet
and took the cost of it out of the cadet's paycheck every month for
four years.

If a cadet/middie drops out of the academy, he keeps the computer, the
uniforms and all the other goodies that the government bought for him
over the years (most of it with his own money), and then a few months
later he receives a bill from Uncle Sam for tuition plus any
outstanding obligations, like the computer loan.

Technically, the Navy does own the middies' laptops, just like the
bank owns your car and your house.  But I don't think the laptops have
a tag on them saying "Property of the US Navy".  (I know that the
USAFA cadets' laptops do NOT have a similar tag.)

Here's a funny thought: I'm *sure* the Business Software Alliance

I wonder how the RIAA would respond to having their own offices
completely trashed and all their computers taken away?  I think that

BMG runs record clubs and record labels. BMG has flat out declared
that all CDs released under its banner (which includes many major
labels) will be "copy protected". To those who can no longer play them
on their equipment, the multi-national conglomerate says: "life is
tough".

I cancelled my membership with BMG's classical music club and refuse
to even consider buying any CD sold by a BMG label. I will look for
the music and download it first. This is how I, a customer, am treated
for my loyalty and the spending of thousands and thousands of dollars
with the club over the past fifteen years or so.

Actually, Warner Brothers has been at the forefront of DVD. Their
earliest releases at the introduction of DVDs were high-quality and
produced taking advantage of DVD's salient features such as 16X9
enhancement and 5.1 audio. WB did an early release of one of its hit
movies (The Matrix) against the advice of George Lucas, who claimed
that they were shooting themselves in the foot. That DVD, one of the
most popular DVDs ever produced, made vast sums of money for the
studio, and it eclipsed the sales of Lucas' SW Episode I when he
finally deigned to release it to DVD, well over a year after it had
been in the theaters.

The studios can be control freaks or they can go with the flow and make 
boatloads of money. It is their choice.

Oh, you mean the great new CDs that won't play in a computer? What
kind of player should they buy? I used to buy CDs when the music could
be transferred to my iPod. By making that action difficult (or
impossible), there is no point in buying CDs anymore since they are
useless to me.

Now I look for downloads.

Some excerpts are below:

             ----------------------------

Dear Mr. Orlowski:

I have just read your story re: "RIAA orders US Navy to surrender." I
am shocked by your factually inaccurate reporting. The RIAA has not,
as you wrote, "mounted a daring raid on the US Navy." Your so-called
reporting gives tabloid journalism a bad name!

We did send letters to colleges and universities as stated in the
original story that you seemed to base your story upon. Perhaps you
misread this paragraph? Or perhaps the truth is less interesting than
the facts?

"Amanda Collins, a spokesman for the Recording Industry Association of
America, said yesterday that the Naval Academy was among the colleges
and universities around the country that were sent two letters from
entertainment industry and educational associations asking them to
address Internet piracy and establish policies against it.

"An Oct. 3 letter signed by four entertainment-based lobbying
associations spelled out that Internet copyright infringement violates
federal copyright laws."

We take copyright infringement seriously but at no time did we demand
that the Naval Academy confiscate computers nor were we aware of their
actions until a REPORTER informed us. We work hand-in-hand with
colleges and universities to address internet piracy. The
characterization of what happened at the Naval Academy is flat-out
wrong.

Your rewriting of The Capital's story was a complete fabrication. I
demand a retraction and I demand the story be taken down immediately.

Thank you.

The Register has *not* taken down their original story -- it's still
up at http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/6/28263.html, as is the
original story from The Capital at
http://www.hometownannapolis.com/cgi-bin/read/live/11_23-19/NAV. 

The latter quotes the October 3 letter as saying that "'Theft' is a
harsh word, but that it is, pure and simple ... It is no different
from walking into the campus bookstore and in a clandestine manner
walking out with a textbook without paying for it."  An interesting
statement, considering that most copyright infringements are not
criminal offenses.

Subject: Students Learning to Evade Moves to Protect Media Files


By AMY HARMON

As colleges across the country seek to stem the torrent of
unauthorized digital media files flowing across their campus computer
networks, students are devising increasingly sophisticated
countermeasures to protect their free supply of copyrighted
entertainment.

Most colleges have no plans to emulate the Naval Academy, which last
week confiscated computers from about 100 students who are suspected
of having downloaded unauthorized copies of music and movie files.
But many are imposing a combination of new technologies and new
policies in an effort to rein in the rampant copying.

Subject: Ad Firms Set Rules For Web Tracking Bugs


By Stefanie Olsen
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

In a relatively late effort to promote consumer privacy, a coalition
of Internet-advertising companies issued on Tuesday guidelines for Web
sites that use tiny electronic tags to track visitors' surfing habits
and gather other data.

The Network Advertising Initiative, a group of eight Web advertising
technology companies, including DoubleClick and 24/7 Media, set
industry standards that require Webmasters to notify visitors when
they use the surveillance tags, also known as Web bugs or beacons, and
what they are used for. The rules also mandate that sites obtain a
consumer's permission before using the technology to collect and share
data that could identify that consumer.

Web site operators use Web bugs -- fairly undetectable strings of code 
in the form of 1-by-1-pixel tags -- to track site usage, count the 
number of visitors to a page or monitor visitor behavior. Ad software 
companies often use the beacons in conjunction with cookies -- another, 
more apparent, monitoring tool -- to track the effectiveness of 
marketing campaigns or collect profiles on Web surfers, which they 
use to customize future promotions.

A huge European telecommunications satellite is trapped in a useless
orbit after the Russian rocket carrying it malfunctioned early on
Tuesday.

The ASTRA-1K satellite was launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan, central Asia, using a Proton K rocket at 2304 GMT on
Monday.

The rocket's Block DM second stage engine fired once after launch 
placing the communications satellite in a temporary low Earth orbit 
at an altitude of 175 kilometres.

The second stage system should have fired twice more to push the
satellite into a geosynchronous orbit at 36,000 km altitude before
separating from the satellite. But these final two firings did not
take place.

Subject: Risk of Internet Collapse Rising


Simulated attacks on key internet hubs have shown how vulnerable the
worldwide network is to disruption by disaster or terrorist action.

If an attack or disaster destroyed the major nodes of the internet, 
the network itself could begin to unravel, warn the scientists who 
carried out the simulations.

The virtual attacks showed that the net would keep going in major 
cities, but outlying areas and smaller towns would gradually be cut 
off.

The researchers warn that the net has become more vulnerable as it 
has become more commercialised and key net cables are concentrated in 
the hands of fewer organisations.

I bought one for a friend a few years ago -- it was a SouthWestern Bell
model. It had a button that allowed the user to listen to the caller
leaving their message without breaking into the call; the user could
press another button to enter the call and cut off the answering
machine if desired.

I think this feature is often called 'call screening' or 'intercept'
and a google search for:

'cordless telephone answering machine intercept' should bring results

Apparently, the RIAA is hypersensitive over being portrayed as the 
jack-booted thugs that they are. They don't hesitate to declare 
customers who make copies for their own personal use "criminals" and 
want to make sure that those same customers get the least possible 
enjoyment of the product they have purchased.

But they don't want anyone to characterize the organization that way.

This is not about fair compensation for composers and artists; this is 
about penalizing paying customers as a smoke screen to cover a desperate 
attempt to remain relevant in the distribution of music. The digital age 
threatens to make the cigar-smoking mogels in luxurious glass office 
buildings obsolete, allowing real musicians to reach audiences directly. 
The futile hope is that by crippling the technology, they can stave off 
the inevitable. 

Many artists do not consider the RIAA their friend, and for good reason.

Ironically, if someone walked out with a CD from the campus bookstore
without paying for it, the RIAA would not be concerned in the
slightest.  It isn't about theft; it is about survival for the
recording industry middlemen.

I don't care for the RIAA, but if they were the Navy's computers, that
is government property and can only be used for authorized government
work.  Unauthorized access, use, modification or data contained or in
transit to or from this system constitutes a violation of Title 18,
USC Sec. 1030 as well as state criminal and civil laws. Storing MP3's
on said computers is a violation of the above law. Another reason is
to prevent virus from entering the computer and affecting the
network. Ask anyone who maintains computers and the network at any
military base will tell you that.  I am retired from the military.

Anyone who likes Red Green is OK.  :-)

I've also watched the "Canadian Air Farce" a few times, and that is
funny, too.

ObTelecom: I wonder if Lily Tomlin's telephone operator character
routines will be funny to people 50 years from now when no living
person will remember what it was like to have living human telephone
operators handling calls.  I suppose comedians will still have
telemarketers and voicemail menus to do routines about.

Presumably, Warner put their best people on these projects.  The
recent release of "Babylon 5 - Season One" on DVD was, apparently,
done by temps.

First off, what the hell was the delay?  B5's been available (well,
about half of the series anyways) on VHS for years.  Finally the DVD
set comes out this month and it's got all kinds of problems.  The
opening "Warner Brothers" logo comes up in high quality, glorious 16x9
widescreen ... and then the main menu shrinks down to 4x3.  And here's
the fun part: the "jumpgate sequence" CGI effect that plays on this
4x3 display WAS REDUCED FROM 16x9, making it appear "squished".

Then you start watching the shows, which were SHOT in 16x9 widescreen
from the get-go ... and find that they haven't gotten it quite right.
On my Sony widescreen, I get a letterboxed image inside a 4x3 display,
which itself is "pillared" to fit my 16x9 display.  If I hit "Zoom",
it fills out horizontally just fine but the image is cropped
vertically.  DAGNABBIT!

Beyond that, the quality of the video transfer ranges from "decent" to
"godawful", often in the same scene.  You'll be watching Sinclair
talking to Garibaldi and it looks great, and then there's a cut to
Ivanova walking in the room and suddenly it's all grainy.  Or, better
yet, in many areas it looks like they transfered from DAMAGED film
stock -- there's rips and tears and burn marks and you name it, it's
there.

Yeah, they're leaders all right.  :-)

Assault on '.info' similar to last month's attack on DNS servers

By Robert Lemos

Nov. 25 - An Internet attack flooded domain name system provider
UltraDNS with a deluge of data late last week, causing administrators
to scramble to keep the servers that host .info and other domains up
and running. The assault sent nearly 2 million requests per second to
each device connecting the network to the Internet -- many times
greater than normal -- during the four hours of peak activity that hit
the company early Thursday morning, said Ben Petro, CEO of UltraDNS.

Nov. 27 - A glitch at the Victoria's Secret Web site allowed customers
who purchased items there to view other customers' orders in some
cases, MSNBC.com has learned. On Friday morning, part of the site was

Is your spouse dissatisfied with the size of your spam? A brand-new 
website has made several hundred thousand pieces of unsolicited 
commercial e-mail available for you to download today. Act now!

After a quiet online debut last week, the Spam Archive is making 
quick strides toward becoming the largest public library of junk 
e-mail on the Internet.

Paul Judge, director of research and development for CipherTrust, the 
e-mail security firm backing the project, says the site received 
roughly 5,000 forwarded messages a day during its first week.

He predicts the archive will amass a corpus of 10 million unsolicited 
commercial e-mails over the next year. The archive's FTP site will 
begin to make its spam available, 10,000 at a time, starting Dec. 4.

People have never been so excited to get junk e-mail.

Federal prosecutors have arrested three men involved in what 
officials are calling the largest identity fraud case in American 
history.

In a press conference on Monday, law enforcement officials described 
the inner workings of the scam, which they said ran for two years and 
resulted in thousands of people across the country collectively 
losing millions of dollars as their bank accounts were drained and 
credit cards maxed out with bogus charges.

Losses due to the scam approach $3 million, said James Comey, U.S.

I have good luck calling various Mediacom offices and asking for the

There already is a universal worldwide standard for numbering:
 + (cc) (ac) (local)
(country code, area code, local number). There is no worldwide
standard for how many digits should be in the (ac) or (local), or
for what might preceed (or substitute for) the "+".

What there ought to be is a convention that allows someone to dial
/any/ call from /any/ location to the /same/ destination number with
the same sequence of digits /after/ the "+", even if the call is
within the same country. But within the NANP, we can't even get that
rule accepted for the digits after the (cc), with some places
requiring and others prohibiting the use of eleven digits.

Well Pat, try this:

1) Go to "http://online.wsj.com" (the root URL of the link Monty
provided) or "http://www.wsj.com".  Both take you to the same page.

You'll be presented with a list of top stories

2) Click on a few of them.

When I try this, I get directed to a page with the Wall Street
Journal Online logo at the top, followed by "The page you requested
is available only to subscribers".  Below that is "Not a subscriber?
Get the Online Journal for just $79 for a full year!  Plus your first
2 weeks are FREE.  Or, pay only $39 annually (if you are a print
Journal or Barron's subscriber)."  I'm then prompted to enter my
username and password.

Given the plethora of excellent news sites out there that do not
require payment (or registration in most cases), WSJ can go piss up a
rope for all I care.  I've got better things to do with my $79.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Remember the story from Monty which
appeared here a few issues ago about what guys can do if TiVo has
diagnosed you as gay, and how to set the record straight? Monty has
reviewed that further, and offers a corrected link from the Wall
Street Journal below. The corrected link runs over a couple lines
and I have not edited it. Monty will explain it further.   PAT]


It appears that the HREF on the web page is wrong. The software that
converted it got confused by the two commas.

It is currently:

<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0">http://online.wsj.com/article_email/0</a>,,SB1038261936872356908,00.html<br>

Can you fix the HTML?

The correct link was sent in the usenet and e-mail versions of the
article.

Thanks.

Throughout this discussion, I have never heard if any of those
midshipmen happened to legally own the CDs (or LPs or cassettes or,
just maybe, 8-track tapes) of the MP3 music that they allegedly
downloaded. Would getting a digital copy of the music they already
owned be a violation of the Honor Code?

Does the RIAA recognize that owners of a particular recording in any
of these formats is entitled to have -- or even download -- an MP3
version of that recording?

All I can say is that the Warner Bros. DVD releases of major features
are supurb on my setup, and they have been this way from the gitgo.
While other companies were releasing non-anamorphic letterboxed
transfers in two-channel surround (like 20th Century Fox, Miramax, and
Polygram), WB was releasing anamorphic, 5.1 products.

The only thing I fault WB for is their lack of DTS releases.

Is there such a thing as a cell phone capable of handling both TDMA
and GSM accounts? Here is my issue: I travel abroad a great deal. I
would like to use a single phone for both my domestic use (Cingular
TDMA) and be able to switch to my European cell phone carrier when I
am in Europe. I realize I will have two providers but I would like to
use one telephone..even two numbers.

Are there SIM chips that can make this happen? Or, am I forced to
change to a U.S. carrier that has GSM service.

Subject: Pick-Six Fix Admitted as Giuliani Steps In


By JOE DRAPE

WHITE PLAINS, Nov. 20 - One is a college dropout turned computer ace; 
the other is the former mayor of New York and of late a well-paid 
symbol of integrity. But today the two shared the spotlight: Chris 
Harn for pleading guilty to fixing the Breeders' Cup pick six last 
month, Rudolph W. Giuliani for promising to come up with security to 
make horse racing's wagering systems impenetrable.

In Federal District Court this morning, Harn stood before Magistrate 
Judge Lisa Margaret Smith and recited how as a senior programmer at 
Autotote, a company that processes horse racing wagers, he used his 
work computer to rig three sets of bets - including the $3 million 
Breeders' Cup pick-six payoff -- made on the accounts of two of his 
former Drexel University fraternity brothers, his co-defendants.

Subject: Mr. Watson, Come Here, You Look a Little Blurry


By DAVID POGUE

A MAN in New York makes a phone call. But instead of just holding a 
handset to his head, he watches a small screen on the phone. He and 
his wife, in Florida, see each other as they chat, thanks to a tiny 
camera on each phone. They don't only talk. They interact by 
gesturing and expressing themselves just as they would in person. 
They have arrived in the future: 1964.

It was the 1964 World's Fair, to be precise, the first public 
demonstration of the AT&T Picturephone. The idea of adding video to 
the telephone seemed so obvious, plenty of people were certain it 
would replace the telephone.

A few niche variations eventually arose, like expensive corporate 
teleconferencing gear and Internet cams that use PC's as 
intermediaries. But even after four decades, no videophone for 
household use over ordinary phone lines has caught on.

The new Vialta Beamer (www.vialta.com) at least stands a chance, 
because of three shrewd decisions by its creators. First, they 
realized that we already have telephones with features and looks we 
like. Therefore, the Beamer adds only the screen: a handsome, 
3.5-inch flat panel that floats in a clear acrylic panel. The Beamer 
screen is dark and easily ignored whenever you're not calling a 
fellow Beamer owner. Your phone remains your phone.

The second breakthrough is the Beamer's simplicity. It goes between 
your phone and the wall jack, like an answering machine. (If you have 
an answering machine too, the Beamer goes between it and the phone.) 
There are no fees, accounts, activation steps or special numbers to 
dial. If you need one more thing to be grateful for on Thanksgiving, 
here's one: that someone, somewhere is still capable of designing a 
high-tech appliance no more challenging than a blender.

Subject: Got paper? / Beth Israel Deaconess Copes With Massive Computer


Beth Israel Deaconess copes with a massive computer crash

By Anne Barnard, Globe Staff, 11/26/2002

Thirteen days ago, as his computer crunched the mountain of data he 
hoped would be his humble contribution to medical progress, the 
researcher -- he shall remain nameless -- got a phone call he'd never 
forget.

It was Dr. John Halamka, the former emergency-room physician who runs
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center's gigantic computer network. He
told the professor that his flood of numbers was overwhelming the
system, threatening to freeze thousands of electronic medical records
and grind the hospital's network to a halt.

''He said, `Oh, my God!' and pulled the plug out of the wall,'' 
Halamka said last week.

It was too late. Somewhere in the web of copper wires and glass fibers
that connects the hospital's two campuses and satellite offices, the
data was stuck in an endless loop. Halamka's technicians shut down
part of the network to contain it, but that created a cascade of new
problems.

The entire system crashed, freezing the massive stream of information
 -- prescriptions, lab tests, patient histories, Medicare bills -- that
shoots through the hospital's electronic arteries every day, touching
every aspect of care for hundreds of patients.

By Jennifer Peter, Associated Press, 11/28/2002 15:16

BOSTON (AP) Employees' irises would become their identification 
badges under a new security system that Logan International Airport 
began testing last week.

Logan, which has gained national recognition for its aggressive 
pursuit of new security measures since Sept. 11, is trying the iris 
recognition system on two entrances to secure areas of the airport, 
according to aviation direction Tom Kinton.

In addition to using an access card and punching in a security code, 
a group of Massport employees participating in the pilot project will 
also have to look into a camera that will scan and verify their 
unique iris codes.

There was a recent humorous commercial on local radio here in the
U.K. which included somebody trying to reach a real live oeprator.  It
went something like this (as near as I recall it):

"Thank you for calling.  To be placed on hold and listen to a tinny
version of Greensleeves, press 1.  To speak to a customer service
representative who has no interest in your problem, press 2.  To speak
to someone who is very friendly and understanding, but no help

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I am sure a good time was had by
everyone at this visual orgy. And I hope all our USA readers today
had wonderful feeding orgies at their Thanksgiving meals. I know I
did. I went down to Coffeyville to my cousin's home with her husband 
and her mother (my aunt), another cousin and his wife and child were
there, and a few other distant or twice/third removed relatives. 
Was it Oscar Wilde or maybe  Emily Dickinson who stated, 'God gives us

Christ Mass in just a month, its all over for another year. I am

Subject: Genuity Bankrupt: Agrees to be Sold to Level 3


Deal planned after firm rises from Chap. 11

By Peter J. Howe, Globe Staff, 11/28/2002

Genuity Inc., the Woburn telecommunications services company whose
corporate roots date to the earliest days of the Internet three
decades ago, filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday as part of a
planned $242 million sale to Level 3 Communications.

In what Genuity chief executive Paul R. Gudonis called ''the best 
possible outcome for our creditors, our customers, and our 
employees,'' Level 3 would buy ''substantially all'' of Genuity after 
its expected emergence from Chapter 11 this winter. Genuity would

And more precisely, it was in relatively small SxS (usually Strowger)
offices serving fewer than 80,000 lines.  Even though Automatic
Electric had done most of the developmental work underlying the
Strowger switching system, Western Electric adopted it for use in the
Bell System.

Back in the 50s, many mid-sized communities were served by Strowger
offices configured for four- or five-digit numbers.  Even after the
introduction of DDD, and the accompanying seven-digit directory
numbers (around 1953), local calls could still be dialed with only
four or five digits: prepended dummy digits were absorbed.

These offices typically used 11X service codes.  I think the reason
for this can be found in the way Strowger equipment works.  Consider a
hypothetical five-digit Strowger office.  Such an office would be able
to serve a maximum of 80,000 lines numbered 2-0000 through 9-9999 (or,
in the switching equipment's internal numbering sequence, 2-1111
through 9-0000).  Numbers beginning with 0 or 1 can't be used as line
numbers:

  - Numbers beginning with 0 (such as 0-2345) can't be used
    because initial 0 is used for operator.

  - Numbers beginning with 1 (such as 1-2345) can't be used
    because of the possibility of a false preliminary pulse (a
    pulse generated by a user who accidentally depresses the
    switchhook momentarily before dialing).  Strowger equipment
    (or, for that matter, any kind of rotary-dial-controlled
    switching equipment) can't tell the difference between a
    false preliminary pulse and deliberately-dialed 1, so, in
    order to prevent possible wrong numbers, initial 1 is not
    used for subscriber numbers.

For such an office, the valid numbering ranges (again in the
switching equipment's internal numbering sequence) would be:

       2-1111 through 2-0000
       3-1111 through 3-0000
       4-1111 through 4-0000
       5-1111 through 5-0000
       6-1111 through 6-0000
       7-1111 through 7-0000
       8-1111 through 8-0000
       9-1111 through 9-0000

Now suppose, for example, that 411 were used for directory assistance
(or "information" as it was known back in the Strowger days).  That
one code would tie up 100 otherwise-valid numbers: 4-1111 through
4-1100.  Using all possible N11 codes (211-911) would tie up 800 valid
numbers, or one percent of the entire numbering capacity of the
office.

On the other hand, using 114 doesn't tie up any valid numbers, and it
still solves the false-preliminary-pulse problem:

  - An initial 1 followed by *anything except* another 1
    defaults to an error tone (or, through special wiring,
    it might be ignored, allowing the caller to reach the
    desired number anyway).  In either case, a false preliminary
    pulse won't cause the caller to reach a wrong number.

  - An initial 1 followed by another 1 can be used for a
    service code because it's very unlikely that a caller would
    inadvertently press the switchhook twice.  Hence,
    combinations 112 through 110 were used as service codes.

  - A false preliminary pulse followed by 11 (i.e., 111)
    defaults to an error tone, so that even a deliberate attempt
    to dial a service code after a false preliminary pulse won't
    reach a wrong number.     

Hempsted B. Miller, in his book TELEPHONE THEORY AND PRACTICE, Volume
3, "Automatic Switching and Auxiliary Equipment" (McGraw-Hill, 1933)
describes just such an office.  In his example:

      111  Error tone 
      112  Error tone 
      113  Information desk
      114  Repair desk
      115  Error tone 
      116  Error tone 
      117  Test desk
      118  Error tone 
      119  Revertive call switch
      110  Toll desk (what we'd now call "long distance")

The revertive call switch was used by party-line callers to call other
numbers on the same party line.  Various 119XX codes would ring back
with a variety of ringing cadences and polarities, alternately ringing
both the calling phone (which had to be hung up momentarily) and the
called phone.
 
But the revertive call switch also worked on single-party lines.  Back
in my college days in Ann Arbor, some of my friends and I (being
typical nosy college students with nothing better to do than study)
took it upon ourselves to document all 100 of Michigan Bell's 119XX
codes.  Believe it or not, I still have that document in my
"telephone" file today, almost 50 years later.

Nowadays, of course, 0 and 1 are the leading digits for intra-NANP
toll calls (or to signal an upcoming NPA if you're in one of *those*
states).  But, as both jdebert and Mark Cuccia have pointed out, that
wouldn't have precluded the use of 11X service codes today.

Except that they'd be longer, probably 11XX (like today's Vertical
Service Codes) or 11XXX.  Or maybe even 111-XXXX!

In any case, perhaps we should thank the Automatic Electric engineers
that developed the Strowger switching system for reserving
leading-digits 0 and 1, even though they reserved them for entirely
different reasons.

Footnote: Speaking of Vertical Service Codes, why did they get that
name?  Here's my theory (but it's just that, a theory).  Most Strowger
switches are configured so that the wipers move in two directions,
vertically and radially (or, as it's sometimes called "up and
around").  A call to, say, 113, requires three switches to move
vertically, one for each digit.  Three vertical motions.  Get it?

It may be the case that the above sequence will get you to a prompt

I believe that Pat's theory was correct: the article URL got munged in
the batched version of the TELECOM Digest and the behavior of the

broken URL. Joey: did you ever try the un-munged URL?

Subject: Cellular Calls to Toll-Free Directory Assistance


I placed a call to toll-free directory assistance (1.800.555.1212)
from my cellular phone during a time period when I shouldn't be
charged. I assumed that there wouldn't be any charges for that call
since all toll-free calls that I have placed during the off-peak time
period have been free of all charges.

When I got the invoice from the phone company, there was a charge of 
something like $1.99 for that call. I called Cingular to ask about it 
and they claimed that they charge for all calls to directory 
assistance. Even calls to toll-free directory assistance.

This doesn't seem right to me.

Who handles toll-free directory assistance from a cellular phone? Is 
it my selected long distance carrier?

Is it possible that they intercept all calls to directory assistance 
and use their own provider?

Has anyone here experienced similar charges calling toll-free 
directory assistance from cellular phones?

Thanks,

Monty

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  Cingular Wireless has been very 
difficult to work with lately for me. The latest hassle began when
Cingular decided to quit paying SWB a service fee for 'wide area 
service' on 620-870. It *had* been set up that calls to my cellular
phone (and every other Cingular customer in Independence) was toll
free via 620-870-last four. Cingular did not tell anyone they were
going to stop that agreement with SWB, they just unilaterally did it
as of November 1. I should have used that *change in contract terms by
them* as an excuse to drop them and get a new cellular provider, but
I didn't. I found out it had happened (no longer wide area and a toll
charge now accessed) a couple days before Thanksgiving when I
discovered a mystery call on my long distance bill for one minute at
fourteen cents calling my cell number from my home line. I went over
to their office Friday on Penn Street downtown and asked them about
it. Yes, they said, 'corporate decided to change the deal with
SWB Telco earlier this month. If you not want people who call you to
have to pay toll, then we have to put you on a local, 620-330 number.'
I waited around while the Cingular clerk here in town called customer
service (or wherever she calls) and took *their* abuse with five to
ten minutes of voicemail hell and holding waiting for *them* to answer
her. Finally she got through, and got a new 330 local number (for
cellphones here; all other phones in town are 331) and reprogrammed
my phone. My voicemail, etc was just carried over to the new number
automatically. I thought I would have to reprogram that, but I did
not. However then I discovered my transfer on busy/no answer from my
home phone to the cell phone no longer worked, of course. When SWB
rang me three times, then withdrew the call, it started going to an
intercept message, about 'number you dialed is not in service'. :(
I then called SWB's business office (wherever it is now; it is no
longer available on the corner of 6th and Maple downtown; all that
is there in recent years is just the switches). 

SWB service rep takes my 'new' cellular number and informs me that as
the spirit moves and they feel inspired, they will change the call
forward on busy/no answer to the new number; but that I need not
expect it until the middle of next week at the earliest. Then she
proceeded to tell me about a 'new package of services' they have which
will 'just cost' me the paltry sum of $3.25 per month if I want her
to turn that on also. There will also be a $6 fee for changing the 
number on delayed call forwarding. So until the middle of next week
sometime, or 'as the spirit moves them' I will have to set my
answering machine back to three rings and pick up the calls here
before SWB telco gets a chance to grab them away and send them for
bogus treatment. All because the folks at Cingular decided to save
money by no longer providing 'courtesy' wide area local calling for
their customers here.   PAT]

HELSINKI, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Consumers in Finland can now send and

popularity of picture messaging.

    Mobile phone maker Nokia (HELS:NOK1V) said on Monday customers of

    Nokia said Finland was the first country to enable consumers to
use MMS between different operators. Several more European carriers
are expected to make similar services possible in coming months across

    MMS allows users to send pictures and sound clips to one another,

Majority-owner Red Sox looking to maximize sports network revenue

By Bruce Mohl, Globe Staff, 11/26/2002

Cable television rates are going up again next year, and a hefty chunk
of the increase can be traced to the Boston Red Sox.

Just as the ball club is trying to squeeze more seats into Fenway Park
to maximize ticket revenues, the team is also putting more games on
its New England Sports Network and hiking subscriber fees.

Local cable operators and NESN declined to comment on the exact size
of this year's increase, but industry sources say the fee per
subscriber is rising anywhere from 40 to 70 cents a month, depending
on the cable system. At one smaller operator, sources say, the monthly
fee is rising 46 percent to $2.20 per subscriber.

NESN is fast becoming one of the most expensive channels on standard
cable locally, and in the process becoming a highly lucrative source
of revenue for the Red Sox and Boston Bruins. The Sox own
approximately 80 percent of NESN, while the Bruins own the remainder.
The New York Times Co., corporate parent of The Boston Globe, is a
limited partner in the group owning the Red Sox.

(and then went into _excellent_ detail of generic numbering/dialing
and switching/trunking situations in small and mid-size town locations
using SxS switching).

But even large cities which used Step-by-Step switching _ALSO_ used
11X service codes, well into the 1960's. Some of these towns/cities
(usually independent telcos, and also _GTE_ held BC-Tel in British
Columbia CANADA) continued using 11X codes into the 1970's and 80's
even after Crossbar, ESS and possibly digital switching replaced
SXS. (I'm also thinking of Centel in Tallahassee FL which still used
11X Codes into the 1970's and Lincoln NE Tel & Tel which IIRC still
used 11X into the 1980's. BCTel also used 11X including 112+ instead
of 1+ for sent-paid-DDD into the 1980's!)

As for larger towns/cities with SxS offices.

A multi-office city would have had to have special trunking if they
used N11 codes for every special service depending on the existing
numbering and dialing w/r/t switching and trunking, or else locate
each N11 answering center in the vicinity of where the central office
beginning with that same specific 'N' digit was located.

Here in New Orleans, we were predominantly SXS for DECADES. The first
#5XB office (Seabrook, 504-CHestnut-x) wasn't installed until circa
1959/60. Step offices were still around until the early 1980's when
they were finally cut to 1AESS (except for the smaller CDO step
offices in the outlying areas of the metro area, which were cut to
digital remotes circa 1989/90).

New Orleans used 11X codes for test and service codes until the early
1960's:

 - 113 for Information/Directory
 - 114 for Repair 
 - 115 and 116 were for special assistance type operators
             (Conference, Marine, Mobile, etc)
 - 117 for Test Board
 - 118+X(1) for multi-party revertive/ringback
 - 119(1) for two-party revertive/ringback
 - 110 for the LD Operator

In the early-to-mid 1960's, we changed over to:

 - 411 for Directory
 - a seven-digit number (870-1122) for Repair
 - special 87X codes from SXS offices for test/ANAC/Revertive(Ringback)

The (already existing) '0' local operator took over the functions that
customers previously dialed 115, 116 and 110 for. Actually, she still
had to connect the customer with the Conference, Marine, Mobile,
etc. special operator. And by the early 1960's, the '0' local operator
was already placing outbound toll calls throughout the US and Canada
herself, without having to pass the customer to a "dedicated" Long
Distance outward operator.

Customer dialed 'DDD' began from New Orleans circa 1962/63, using the
"standard" (beginning in the 1960's esp. from Step offices) access of:
1+ NPA (if not your 'home' area code) + 7D or 2L-5N We never used 112+
to reach the local DDD/CAMA tandem.

Note that the seven-digit number for Repair at that time was 870-1122,
that it begins '87' which was for SXS offices to use for "test"
functions as well. When calling from a STEP office (but not a #5XB or
later ESS), the '0' and '1s' were absorbed at the '87' misc.code
selector, thus you could "get by" (ONLY FROM a STEP office) with just
'872' to call Repair!

In the 1960's, there was only one central office switch in the New
Orleans metro area beginning with '4', "HUnter-x", 48x. Calls to
48x-xxxx from another local SXS office outside of the "HUnter" office,
trunked to the "HUnter" office just on the single digit '4'. The next
dialed digit '8' would be "absorbed" by the "incoming selector" switch
at the "HUnter" office. The next customer-dialed digit, the 'C' digit
of the 48-X code, was now actually switched by the "HUnter" office's
incoming selector switch. The reamining dialed digits, -xxxx, were all
switched by each subsequent selector (and eventually final connector)
switches within the "HUnter" office.

But this means that _ALL_ calls to 411 from other Step offices in the
metro area were routed through the "HUnter" office. The '4' trunked
one to "HUnter", and then the '1' being dialed were switched at the
incoming selector at "HUnter" over to Information (Directory). Also,
it probably meant that there couldn't be a 481 prefix, since this too
would actually route to Directory with the '8' being absorbed in
"HUnter". The center where the Directory operators were located had to
be trunked to from "HUnter" in these calls originating from other Step
offices. I seem to think that Southern Bell / South Central Bell had a
directory operator center in the vicinity of the "HUnter" office.

When there were additional 4Nx central offices added in the metro area
during the 1970's, such as the 43x Avondale new ESS ffice, the 44x ESS
at Shrewsbury for the Westgate locality, the 45x ESS at Shrewsbury for
the West Metairie locality, and the 46x new Briarwood ESS office in
Kenner, all SXS offices in the metro area had to build new "Fourth
Level Second Selector" switches within their own offices.

 From each SxS office, '4' would trunk to this 4th-Level Second
Selector switch within the same building. Then the next digit would
"trunk out" to the proper switch:

4-1 for Directory
4-3 for the Avondale ESS
4-4 for Shrewsbury ESS (intended for 44x Westgate customers)
4-5 for Shrewsbury ESS (intended for 45x West Metairie customers)
4-6 for Kenner Briarwood ESS
4-8 for the original "HUnter" SXS (which cut to ESS in the late 1970s)

Now, each SXS office in the metro area could install direct trunks to
the Directory Operator Center without having to have the calls
switched via the "HUnter" office. There could be additional Directory
Operator centers or they could have re-located the directory operator
center location.

We didn't have 911 at the time. If we did, _ALL_ calls to 911 from SXS
offices would have had to pass thru the Franklin 94x office (dialed as
"WHitehall"), since there were no other 9Nx offices/codes in the metro
area (at that time). Dialing a '9' from a SXS office routed directly
just on that digit, to Franklin (WHitehall, 94x).

In the long run, this was inefficient trunking, but at that time, it
did work. But 11X codes would have eliminated a lot of the
inefficiencies that Step offices using N11 codes in small/mid-size
cities had. Only the LARGEST Step cities if they had multiple
office-code selectors for all office code digits dialed, or else
directors/registers/ some form of "common contral" would have had the
most efficient use of trunking with N11 codes.

IMO, I think that AT&T / Bell Labs (in the 1960's) should have
recommended that Panel/XB cities migrate to 11X codes rather than
requiring SXS cities migrate to N11 codes, as mentioned
earlier. However, would this have meant that 112+ would have become
the DDD/CAMA/Toll access prefix from all SXS areas? (as well as
possibly Panel/Crossbar areas which never really "needed" an "access"
prefix for DDD?) I know that there were some SXS areas using
1+nxx(etc) for DDD _AND_ at the same time using 11X Service codes back
in the 1960's/70's. There are two possible ways this could have been
done, EITHER:

[1] a "double headed trunk" which connected to BOTH the DDD/CAMA
tandem AND had a connection to the misc.codes (11X) selector within
the same office, where if the second digit after the initial '1' were
another '1', the connection to the DDD/CAMA tandem would be "dropped"
leaving the connection to the '11X' codes selector opened up; OR if
the second digit were a 'N' ('2' thru '9', i.e., the customer intends
DDD, 1+NNX-xxxx toll within their own NPA, or 1+NPA+NNX-xxxx toll
outside of their own NPA), the connection to the '11X' codes selector
would "drop" leaving the connection to the DDD/CAMA tandem open, and
already having picked up the second customer dialed digit (first digit
of 'foreign' NPA or first digit of office code within 'home' NPA) in
its registers.

OR,

[2] where an initial dialed '1' goes to DDD/CAMA, and if the customer
dials a second '1' followed by an 'X' digit, the call will route to
Directory, Repair, LD-Operator, etc. _thru_ the DDD/CAMA toll switch
acting as a "local area tandem". However, this use of '11x' going to
DDD/CAMA as a tandem for mservice code functions would dis-allow the
use of 11x for local office test functions (117 for Test Board unless
it were a centralized test board via the DDD/CAMA tandem, or 118-X(1)
and 119(1) for party-line ringback/revertive calling, dial-speed
tests, etc, which usually were handled _within_ one's own central
office).

But most SXS areas adopted some _OTHER_ NN(x) or NX(x) range (such as
the 87x range in New Orleans) for such misc. test and party-line
functions when our SXS (and #5XB) offices abandoned 11X codes in the
early-to-mid 1960's.

  87(0-11)2(2) Repair Service
  87-3-0       ANAC 'in'
  87-3-2222222 ANAC 'out'
  87-4(1)      Two Party Revertive Ringback
  87-5+(?)     ANAC but "quoted" as a string of touchtones!
  87-6         LOUD dialtone then SILENCE (would hold the line up a min)
  87-7         Test Board
  87-8-X(1)    Multi-Party Revertive Ringback
  87-9         Reorder with high tone (would hold the line up a minute)

(The 876 holding the line up a minute ... In High School back in the
1970's, some students would drop their nickel into the payphone, COIN
FIRST GROUND START, dial 876, hang up, and then walk aside for a
while.  The line of students waiting to use the payphone would each
then drop in their nickel expecting dialtone, not get any since the
line was "held up", and then all of them would leave thinking the
phone was out of order. A minute or two later, the SXS c.o.switch
would release the line, return ALL of the nickels on the "escrow
plate", and then someone would collect them all up ... sneaky, but it
worked! You COULD tell that this could happen to YOUR nickel, if you
said something into the phone before dropping in a nickel to make a
call, because you STILL had "sidetone" while the SXS switch "held the
line up"; BTW, throughout Louisiana, it was still a nickel untimed for
a local coin call until 1979 when it went up to a dime, then a quarter
in 1983, and then COCOTs in the later 1980's+, and then the Telecom
Act of 1996 'deregulation' of all payphones when BellSouth went up to
35-c now 50-c for local calls from its payphones).


But the use of 11X codes instead of N11 codes, NANP-wide, WOULD have
allowed N11 to instead be used as "special area codes" along the line
of N00 codes (and the special area codes 888, 877, 866, etc., the
generic form as NYY, where the second and third digits are
identical) ... and there REALLY could be "POTS" (or special) office
codes in the seven-digit part of the number, with 'N11'. And then
_ALL_ special "local" test/service/ or "CLASS"/Vertical Service
"control" codes could be extended to 11-XXX(X). There would be no need
for two sets of instructions or footnotes, where '*XX' is the main
quoted instruction and a footnote of 11-XX for rotary-dial /
pulse-dial customers. All instructions would have simply quoted
11-X(X(X(X))) for such "special" functions.

And I have NEVER really figured out WHY telco uses the name "vertical"
for CLASS/Custom Calling/etc. functions! :-)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: First, a hearty thank you to Mark Cuccia
for still another good report on old style phone service and how
things were done forty-plus years ago. 

My own contribution to the conversation about S x S switching systems 
is this:  Long after Bell System had 'standardized' their method of
dialing (back in the 1950-60's) with 2L and 5D (or in some early
cases, 7D) and DDD was being implemented, we *still* could not direct
dial into GTE territories (such as Fort Wayne, IN or Lafayette, IN) 
because of those towns 'odd' ways of dialing things (or so we 
thought). Fort Wayne had 'Anthony' with four digits following it, and
Lafayette had five digit dialing but no exchange name that we could
discern. Numbers in Lafayette would be such as 34567, and I assume the
'3' was part of some prefix. Purdue University was the exception,
where there were two ways of reaching them, from locally in Lafayette
and West Lafayette. Dialing just '90' reached the Purdue operator but
dialing '92' followed by five digits for the campus extension got you
to that phone. Long distance callers still had to ask their local 
operator for 'Lafayette 90' and recite the extension number to the
campus operator as '234567' or six digits. And your local operator
did not dial anything; she just plugged in and waited until the
distant operator answered 'Lafayette' then she gave the desired five
digit number for you (or in the case of Purdue, '90' then when Purdue
answered the other five digits.) Or sometimes the local operator would
pass '92' plus five and Lafayette would dial it instead. Calling in
reverse from there to Chicago, Lafayette did the same thing; plugged
in, waited for Chicago to answer then asked for the seven digit
desired number. 

And although Lafayette would later be in the 317 area code, at the
time if you tried to call using 317+7D the call would fail to
complete. The operator's routing book said to 'mark sense' the ticket
as 317+151+ when she handed the call off to the Lafayette
operator. Does anyone remember the those old 'mark-sense' codes the
operators used in the early (and partially DDD) days?

Regards high school and illicit money collections: In the pre-dial
days the payphones were also coin first, followed by battery and
wait for operator response to pass the number. 'Someone' left an old
bent up coat hanger in the pay phone booth at school with a note
written on the booth wall saying 'do you know how to use this?' Also
written on the walls of the booth were the various juvenile obscenities
for which kids are famous. And sure enough, kids would put their 
nickle in the box, and with luck have the coat hanger up the return
chute and trip the escrow table the 'right' way and have the nickel
back sometimes before the operator even answered. Other kids knew
how to use a safety pin through the cloth cord and ground the phone
the right way to get battery, knowing that battery meant the operator
would be along in a minute or so to take the call. The main hassle
with safety pin versus coat hanger was that tripping the ground to
get battery merely got you at best a local (five cent) call. For a
long distance call there still had to be additional coins deposited
and the operator would listen for the 'ding' (five cent coin), the
'ding ding' ten cent coin or the 'dong' 25 cent quarter coin. If she
did not hear those you did not get your call. That's where the coat
hanger came in handy. If it was a smart operator, she knew she had
to 'collect fast' immediatly on answer since some people would manage
to retrieve the coins and cheat the company otherwise. But sometimes
the operators screwed up also, collecting or returning in error. If
the former she would offer 'the next call will be free' or if you 
insisted the nickel would be sent back in the mail. The other way --
improper return of coins, she would apologize and ask you -- plead --
with you 'please deposit the money again.'  

On the same topic, the first *dial* service in Whiting, Indiana was
the Standard Oil Whiting Refinery. The phone system there, known as
'Stanotel' allowed three digit dialing around the refinery. Dial the
single digit '7' got you a Chicago tie-line with dial tone. Dialing
the single digit '8' got you the Stanotel network around the USA.  But
dialing '9' for a local call got you battery and then speaking to the
local Whiting operator, while dialing '0' got you the operator at the
refinery, which is where all incoming calls to 'Whiting 2111'
(refinery main number) went for handling. I think the refinery had a
Rolm PBX, the only one I have ever seen/heard of where '9' did not get
you an outside dial tone but instead a wait to give your local number
to the operator audibly. I think a few of the executives there like
my grandpa (assistant superintendent) had 'private outside direct
lines' as buttons on their phones. Grandpa had a five button phone on
his desk, two buttons were refinery extensions; a third button was
different; it got Chicago dial tone directly on using it.  PAT]

You can have some of that but not all of that.

Cingular currently offers a GAIT (GAIT (GSM ANSI-136 Interoperability
Team) a technology that enables GSM and TDMA networks to interoperate)
model the Nokia 6340i that cingular uses so their customers can use
both the IS-136 (TDMA) part of their network (the majority of their
network) or GSM (Carolinas, some of Tennessee, California, Nevada &
Washington state.)  The GAIT phone works on GSM networks in both 1900
and 800 Mhz, IS-136 (TDMA) in 1900 and 800 Mhz and also in AMPS
(analog 800) networks.  To use your service anywhere else other than
in the Americas you'll need a phone capable of at least 900 Mhz
operation and preferably also able to use 1800 Mhz networks.

Currently there is no handset that will do TDMA, AMPS and GSM in all
four GSM frequencies (800, 900, 1800 & 1900.)  If you need to use GSM
in Europe with an US carrier such as T-Mobile or cingular it might be
just as well that you purchase a GSM 900/1800 phone through eBay or
some other online place just for use in Europe and just transfer the
SIM card when you get on the plane (or off it.)  That said cingular is
the only IS-136 operator that is using true GAIT phones.   AT&T is
marketing a Siemens phone the S46 that will work on IS-136, GSM 900
(no 1800) and GSM 1900.  It does not have AMPS so it is not a true
GAIT phone, but that might work for you.  AT&T markets this I believe
as a "multi-network" plan.
http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?id=84  Hope this helps.

Also, keep in mind that AT&T is fairly new to the GSM scene and does
not have a full set of roaming agreements in place so you should check
to see whether the country you are planning to travel to has a roaming
agreement with AT&T.  AT&T at this point will not obtain unlock codes
for their customers so if you want to opt for pre-paid overseas that
is not an option at this time.

Qualcomm and, I think, Samsung have recently announced a CDMA/GSM
multi-standard phone, but I don't know of any TDMA/GSM phones. 

I'm afraid that, yes, in order to roam in Europe you'll need to be
with a US GSM carrier (with a tri-band phone, that also works on the
international 900 and 1800 MHz bands for GSM, as well as the 1900 MHz
band used in North America). Alternatively you could, when in Europe,
buy a pay-as-you go GSM phone for use on this side of the
Atlantic. You'll need to shop around to ensure you can roam across
European countries with it: different operators in Europe have
different rules. For example Orange pay-as-you-go phones in the UK
will work on Orange-afiliated networks in around 13 European countries
(see http://www.orange.co.uk/cgi-bin/international/phone_start.pl?tariff=payg)

-- and you can pick up a phone at any Orange shop or other dealer and
have it working in minutes. You don't need a local address or anything
like that. A Siemens A50 is on the market for GBP69.99 -- just over
$100 -- on a pay-as-you-go deal.

That will also mean that you'll get the benefits of low rates for calling
numbers in Europe -- while a US phone company would probably add a hefty
mark-up.

The third choice is to rent a phone while you're here -- but that
would mean you wouldn't know your number until you picked up the phone
at the airport.  And now that mobile phones are so common,
rent-a-phone services are probably getting scarce and expensive.

The RIAA does not regard "fair use" as legitimate. As far as I know,
that organization regards the many gigabytes of MP3s on my hard drive
as "pirated" music, yet not one byte came from anywhere other than my
very own CD library. The RIAA wants no technology out there that it
doesn't control. MP3 = bad.

Technology that can be used by customers to their own advantage is a
threat and must be eliminated.

RIAA's dream digital technology is a file format that is serialized
and can only be played on software that reports to and receives
permission to play tunes from a mothership. The RIAA doesn't just want
you to pay for your music, they want to control where, how, when, on
what, how often, and for how long you can listen to it.

It is known as "rights management", where the record company manages 
your rights.

The station in Des Moines is probably WHO-AM 1040, a 50kw
'international clear channel' station.  Since sometime in the '50s,
their slogan for their late-night broadcasts has been: "Coast to
Coast. Border to border. And *THEN* some."

They regularly have listeners from Alaska and Hawaii phoning the
call-in line.  And at least a few times a year, somebody will phone in
who is receiving them in *Australia*.  There is, as I recall, a
'window of opportunity' of about 1/2 hour each day, when conditions
are right for reliable reception in part of AU.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Radios are amazing things, aren't they.
I used to have a *very good* digitally tuned short wave radio which
also had medium wave on it. Everything from below AM broadcasts (it
started at 150 kc I think) and tuned up to around 30 Megs in different
bands. It also tuned FM stations digitally. I dearly loved that radio. 
Then one day it got stolen, and that as 'they' say, was that. I think
it cost me around $150-200 back in the middle 1980's.  I had to put an
antenna wire up in my apartment to get the best reception. Maybe 
some day I will get another one. I love scanning shortwave stations
and DXing AM stations in the USA. 

My favorite station is KRPS in Pittsburg, Kansas at 89.9 FM, the
classical music station from NPR at Pittsburg State University.
Trouble is, Pittsburg is a *trip* from here, about 70-80 miles east,
next to Joplin, MO and that distance is a bit far for most FM
stations. I have a Bose radio/CD and when I put an external antenna on
it I can get KPRS. They also have a repeater-translator at 102.7 FM in
Bartlesville, OK but that one is run off the air by KIND the local
station at 102.9. They also have a repeater in Iola, Kansas but that
is farther away than even Joplin/Pittsburg, and the religion people
here in town (91.9 FM American Family Association) run Iola away. And
the PBS station in Tulsa is just to weak to come in here, and that is
about 90 miles straight south. KPRS has a stereo signal, but I do not
get stereo for it, just a mono signal, which seems to imply I am just
getting 'wisps' of it that happen to get here. I know if I had a good
rooftop antenna like many folks in town I could make the trip from
Pittsburg quite easily.  PAT]

first day of the new month) that I use to ask you to please, kindly
remember TELECOM Digest and my expenses in getting this (mostly) spam
free, reader-written moderated newsgroup out to you on a daily (often
times several times daily) basis. As most of you know by now, a new
'deal' is underway: I now have the second edition of the CD for
Telecom Archives available (my thanks for this to Joey Lindstrom) and
unlike the first edition back in 1995, this time around it will be
an ongoing to-date thing, along with old-time radio shows, including
Agnes Morehead's famous radio presentation of 'Sorry, Wrong Number'.

The CD includes about 80 megs of messages and special files from our
archives (1981 to present time), and if you are connected to the
internet when you look at it, dozens of links to other resources of
interest. But you do not have to be on the net to use it; the CD
itself has all the 22 years' worth of our files. In addition, with
several old time radio shows with telephone themes, and Ms. Morehead
in the *Suspense* radio drama production, I think you will want a
copy of it for your library. You make a donation to the Digest in
an amount of at least $25 (or more, as you find appropriate) and ask

As a matter of fact, we *do* run our own credit department as well.
We sell subscription-based services, so *everything* is on a credit
basis of one form or another.  At present credit-card transactions
account for less than 5% of sales.  Our 'internal' costs for
processing credit-card transactions are virtually identical with those
for 'payment by check'.  *BEFORE* the credit-card processing charges
are figured in.  This is, in large part, due to the nature of our
business, *and* to very sophisticated automation supporting the
credit/billing process.

It's interesting you should mention NSF checks -- we have had a
*single* instance of that (last week, actually), in the last 5+ years.

As to what I want, I want:

   1) the ability to _know_ what my costs are, *in*advance*, on any given
      transaction.
   2) the ability to "audit" the accuracy of those costs, as assigned by
      the Credit-Card issuer.
   3) *IF* the card _issuer_ is going to charge me *more* for handling 
      specific classes of their cards, I want to be able to pass that 
      surcharge through to the card *holder*.

"Surcharging" the *merchant* for handling debit-card transactions is
disingenious, at best.  The 'risk' to the card issuer on such
transactions is *ZERO*.  The issuer doesn't approve the transaction
until _after_ they have actually withdrawn the money from the
cardholder's account.  They're _not_ 'advancing' the payment to the
merchant, there is *no* 'cost of carry'.

The reason for that additional charge is 'profiteering', pure and
simple.  Since the payment _from_ the card-holder is immediate, they
don't have the chance to "get rich" off the finance charges imposed on
any 'unpaid balance'.  So, they have to make money on the transaction
'somewhere else'.

Similarly with the 'corporate' cards.  The issuer provides a 'nice'
bundle of additional services to the cardholder.  *Somebody* has to
pay for those 'extras'.  What is the benefit _to_the_merchant_ of
those 'extras'??  Why should the _merchant_ who accepts the card get
stuck with that 'extra' cost?  If the cardholder wants those services,
let the cardholder _pay_ for them.  That *is* the 'fair' way to do
things.

I'm entirely willing to pay the 'base-level' transaction fees for
processing credit cards.  I object _violently_ to being forced,
*involuntarily*, to pay for those "other" services, from which I
derive *NO* benefit.

Would you buy gasoline from a station that has an advertized price of
$1.69/gal, but charged you $1.69/gal, or $2.29/gal, or $3.17/gal,
*and* wouldn't tell you which price you were paying until AFTER you'd
filled your tank?  That is *EXACTLY* the situation with
'credit/corporate/debit' cards today.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: One slight correction in what you say,
regards debit cards. The merchant does not get his money, nor does the
money come out of the card holder's account at the time approval is
given, but rather, when the *actual document* or magnetic tape entry
reaches the bank. Sales authorization is given based on what the 
account *looks like at the time of approval.* A sale could be approved
because there is money in the account or the sale is under the daily
limit for the customer. But before the merchant's paper gets to the 
office, some other merchant slides in with a check the customer wrote
or gets his debit charges in first. He gets paid because there is 
actual money in the account to pay him. Now your paper shows up a few 
days later -- the account is devoid of money -- you still get paid
since sales authorization guarenteed you your money. Now the bank is
left holding the bag. I know you are probably saying why didn't the
bank put a 'hold' on the money you had been guarenteed. In some cases
they do, but usually they do not. It depends on the customer's
relationship with the bank in many cases.    PAT]

I tried it three ways, including reading the URL off one computer and
typing it into another (and given the chance of error, I did this no
fewer than four times).  Each time I got no story and an exhortation
for cash.  Similarly, when I went to WSJ's front page, every single
"lead story" gave me the "this page is only for non-deadbeats, so pay
up!" schtick.

I'm not against paying for online content, providing that I feel it's
worthwhile to me and it's something I can't get for free elsewhere. 
Indeed, I have a few such subscriptions, including one which will
probably surprise nobody here: to the "Rush Limbaugh 24/7" site.  :-)
 I don't demand that everything on the internet be free (though I
think I'm in the minority on this one, at least as far as this forum
is concerned).  What I *AM* saying is that a $79 annual fee for a
website that I might visit once or twice a year, and which otherwise
really doesn't offer anything UNIQUE (at least to me - others will
have different opinions), is simply a deal I'll take a pass on.

Now, obviously something was wrong with the URL that Monty passed
along to us, as Monty himself noted, and that's how I managed to
stumble into page after page of demands for money.  Although I've yet
to actually see it (even the corrected URL doesn't work for me), I'll
take Monty and others here at their word that this particular story
CAN be viewed for free.  What I would ask of Monty is that maybe in
future he inform us of any restrictions a site may impose when
posting a URL based on that site (ie: the way Pat jumps in and gives
us a free username/password to use on NYTimes stories).  Monty
apparently didn't even know about this $79 fee, and I assumed he did,
and thus "my bad" - I should have been a bit more civil in my
response to him: Monty, I apologize for that, and please otherwise
keep up the great work.

NOTE: I AM NOT A LAWYER

That said, I've done some extensive reading on the subject.  You would
think that downloading an MP3 of a song you already own (say on CD or
cassette or whatever) would constitute fair use, just as creating an
MP3 from your own legally-purchased copy would be.  But that's not the
case.  It is fair use for *YOU* to make an MP3 of YOUR copy, which is
what makes these recent CD releases that don't function on a PC all
the more reprehensible.  It is *NOT*, however, fair use for someone
else to make an MP3 of THEIR copy and give it to you, EVEN IF YOU OWN
A COPY OF THE SONG.  It's a really stupid distinction to make, but the
distinction DOES exist.  If you want the MP3 and remain in compliance
with the law, then make it yourself - downloading it is a violation of
copyright, both on your part and on the part of the person making it
available for download.

OK, yes, I'll give them that much credit.  Still, they really fell
down on the Babylon 5 release.  Babylon 5 was the FIRST television
series in broadcast history to be shot entirely in 16:9, because the
series' creator, J. Michael Straczynski, recognized that widescreen
was the display format of the future.  He knew that sometime down the
road, they'd be able to release Babylon 5 on home video in some sort
of widescreen format (DVD's didn't yet exist) and people would be in
for a real visual treat.

And Warner blew it completely -- it's one of the poorest video
transfers I've ever seen, and they didn't even get the 16:9 part
right.  This release should have been another jewel in Warner's
crown.  Instead, they should be embarrassed.

> The only thing I fault WB for is their lack of DTS releases.

I fault every studio on that.  I own about 300 DVD's.  Precisely two
of them have a DTS track.  One of them, Terminator 2, has both Dolby
5.1 and DTS, and you can switch between them.  The difference is
INCREDIBLE.  Dolby 5.1 is nice and all, but DTS makes it sound like an
old Victrola.  :-)

I recognize that this is off-topic, but can anyone here explain to me
why Canada and the USA recognize the SAME holiday on different days?
This year, Canadian Thanksgiving Day was Monday October 14th, whereas
USA Thanksgiving Day fell on Thursday November 28th.  What's up with
that?

joey@lairdsflooring.com

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: And you have always celebrated New
Year's Day on January 1; until about the sixteenth century most of
Europe celebrated New Years on March 21 each year. Seriously. The
New Year was considered to begin on the Spring Solstice rather than
the first day of the first month after the start of the Winter Solstice.
In other words, March 21 of any year was followed by March 22 the next
year. But Canada from its founding always used January 1 as the
date. And when you consider the calendar we both use, a Spring Solstice
makes better sense; after all OCTober means 8, not '10' as we consider it;
NOVember means 9, rather than the '11' we consider it; and I will give
you a guess on what DECember means, like 10 maybe. So what happened in 
the numbering to the other two months?  Well, January and February
were part of *last year* until the calendar was tampered with, by 
Pope Gregory, I believe, i.e. the 'Gregorian' system of calendaring.

But to answer your question, Americans chose to celebrate Thanksgiving
(or the 'Day of Mourning' as certain Indian tribes phrased it) on the
final Thursday in November when President Lincoln asked them to at the
conclusion of the war between the states. Prior to that, it had been
on various dates in October each year for a hundred years or
so. Contrary to some opinions, the non-conforming Puritans held the
first such event in the summer, while the conforming Puritans held one
in the winter. Both conforming and non-conforming Puritans celebrated
each other's feast days, although they did disagree on what date it
should be observed but not enough to go without eating. (among other 
things they disagreed on.) 

Then when King Roosevelt the Second came into office he made it
official here in the USA that the fourth (not necessarily the last)
Thursday in November would be used for Thanksgiving, and it has been
that way since sometime in the 1930's ... we also disagree (the
Canadians and the USA) on Rememberance Day, which we used to call
Decoration Day and for several years now have officially called
Memorial Day. It *used* to be in the USA that Decoration Day was
*always* on May 30. It could be a Wednesday or a Sunday or whenever,
but it was always on May 30. Then when the USA Congress passed the
'Monday Holiday Act' (that was its official name), Memorial Day was
shifted to the fourth Monday in May. Now it can happen anytime between
May 23 and May 31.  When is your Rememberance Day?  Ditto with
Veterans Day on a Monday in November. It used to be Armistace Day on
November 11, which is the date on which the First War ended in
1918. Now it is variable, on a Monday in November.

And Easter; that's a good one. The ancient Romans always held a big
feast for the Goddess Oeaster to worship Her for the return of warm
weather and another season of crops, etc.  Goddess Oeaster made her
appearance with the new moon at the start of the New Year each spring
(remember March 21 as New Year's Day) and Julius (one of the Caesers)
refined it so the pagan worship of the Goddess Oeaster always happened
to fall more or less the same dates. In his corrections of the errors
in Julius Caeser's calendar (the Julian system of calendaring) Pope
Gregory declared that henceforth the more modern Anglicized Easter
holiday would be celebrated by the church (after all, why should the
pagans get all the fun?) as a religious day, and that it would in
fact be celebrated at Mass on the first Sunday following the New Moon
in the Spring Equinox or Solstice, meaning it will always happen 
between March 22 and April 15, which was about when Goddess Oeaster
would appear each year centuries before. 

Finally, the Gregorian Reformation occurred in the USA in September,
1752. To look at a *very* strange calendar, on a Unix box do the
command 'cal 9 1752'   You will see that Wednesday, September 2, 1752
was immediatly followed the next day by Thursday, September 14, 1752. 
The twelve day gap had to be finally done in the USA to conform to
Pope Gregory's new calendar. It would have been done 150 years earlier
but the non-conforming Puritans raised such a stink. Is this enough 
calendar trivia for now?    PAT]

Here is the deal.

We have  the phone  company and cable  company providing service  to a
business say three miles away. That is  the end of the line  for both the
cable and phone company.  Well there are about 30 families due east of
the store, from one to ten miles away.

Is there a way we can pool together and come up with a wireless/
microwave system that will tie us to the service at the business. Both
the phone company and cable company have found it would be too
expensive to lay cable, for so few people. So now we are looking at
having the service provider provide service at the end of the line
there, and we will chip in and buy some kind of radio/microwave radio
that will connect the houses.  Anyone have any ideas.

I leased a Teletype (Model 33 ASR) back then, from the telco -- and
asked to have it set for even parity since I was using it as a remote
data entry terminal to a computer.  This was an unusual use, and an
unusual request -- but it could be set to use even parity.  When an odd

Yes -- it did table look-up to accomplish arithmetic.  The tables were
loaded into the regular memory -- and so one could alter the tables to
do arithmetic using any base less than 10.  It was a handy feature if
one wanted to do octal arithmetic.

I am experiencing the same thing and have escalated to my carrier's
regional executive appeals department. My carrier is Verizon. They
charge $1.25 plus airtime to directory calls. If I'm calling Verizon
Wireless's own 411 Connect service, that's one thing -- it costs them
money to provide the service and I don't expect them to eat the costs;
but I got charged on a call to AT&T's 800-555-TELL. The $1.25 appeared
on my bill as toll charges (as opposed to LD or airtime).

I was told that the calls were charged due to the special routing that
was required. Again, I can see this with Verizon's own service, but
not with calls to an outside 800 number!

> This doesn't seem right to me.

> Who handles toll-free directory assistance from a cellular phone? Is

It ought to be routed like any 800 call. I don't get charged for calls
to my own toll-free number. I don't get charged for calling my bank to
find out what my balance is.

According to VZW customer service, I DO get charged if I call a
service that provides horoscopes, movie listings, or an "adult" line
(WTF? Do they have people calling every tollfree in existence?)

What about Moviefone? 440-777-FILM is a free call from any phone line
that is local to 440-777. Do I get charged for that too?

I am going to get this policy *fixed*.

I don't want to leave Verizon Wireless. In all other aspects of the
service, they have treated me VERY well. *611 is always answered in
60-90 seconds (I've timed it, many times). They're quite helpful, and
so are the people at my local store. I took advantage of a recent
promo and now have exactly the calling package I need. And I don't
want to have to give out my new phone number to everyone, *again.*

But I also pay $104.99 per month for my calling plan. For ONE PHONE.
And while the price is competitive with similar plans from other
carriers (I talk a lot), it's still, in an absolute sense, a buttload
of money for one person to be spending on one phone, so I don't expect
VZW to nickel-and-dime me to death. I'm a low-maintenance customer,
and I don't do stuff like roaming that would cost Verizon money, that
they wouldn't be able to charge me for.

This has all the appearances of a really scummy deal -- and it may
also indicate that as the European trans-national agencies in Brussels
get bigger and acquire more and more influence, the kind of

Telco number readbacks became so unreliable and mutable that I finally
set up my own several years ago for my own private use. It has two
versions: one using an ordinary directory number to read back CID and
one (using an 800 number) that reads back ANI. Very handy.

I notice that the venerable PacBell readback number has finally bit the 
dust here as well, however.

Telco readback numbers typically only serve a comaratively small area. 
The advantage of having my own is that they work from any phone,

remember TELECOM Digest and my expenses in getting this (mostly) spam
free, reader-written moderated newsgroup out to you on a daily (often
times several times daily) basis. As most of you know by now, a new
'deal' is underway: I now have the second edition of the CD for
Telecom Archives available (my thanks for this to Joey Lindstrom) and
unlike the first edition back in 1995, this time around it will be
an ongoing to-date thing, along with old-time radio shows, including
Agnes Morehead's famous radio presentation of 'Sorry, Wrong Number'.

The CD includes about 80 megs of messages and special files from our
archives (1981 to present time), and if you are connected to the
internet when you look at it, dozens of links to other resources of
interest. But you do not have to be on the net to use it; the CD
itself has all the 22 years' worth of our files. In addition, with
several old time radio shows with telephone themes, and Ms. Morehead
in the *Suspense* radio drama production, I think you will want a
copy of it for your library. You make a donation to the Digest in
an amount of at least $25 (or more, as you find appropriate) and ask
for your personal copy of the CD. Be sure to include the address where

Subject: Anyone a Trimline Guru?


I've become interested in finding a few old trimline phones. Why? I
don't know. A mental defect i suppose. Anyway, I know that in
trimlines, there are rotary and touchtones. In the touchtones, there
are those that require a transformer to light the buttons and those
that do not. These seem to be identified as either round button (need
transformer) or square button (not need).

Now, my question concerns the early touchtones that required the
transformer. Were all the early trimline touchtones handsets narrower
than the rotary trimline handset ones? You know that the rotary
trimline had a nice curved sides to accommodate the dial. I never had
a TT trimline, but all the pictures of them that I see, they seem to
be more square and less shapely than the rotary ones. Can someone clue
me in on this?  


Thanks Noel

Subject: "Grave questions of invasion of privacy"


Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, warns that the Total 
Information Awareness program threatens our basic rights -- and 
questions whether Adm. Poindexter is the right man to run it.

Nov. 26, 2002  |  President Bush signed the landmark Homeland 
Security Act into law Monday, setting in motion the most ambitious 
reorganization of the federal government in decades. Already, though, 
critics on both the right and the left are worried that measure will 
create a mechanism for unprecedented spying on U.S. citizens.

I have a friend that I phone each day.  He is always happy to hear
from me.  The problem is that he screens his calls and I have to
listen to the complete outgoing message before I can say who I am and he
then picks up the phone.

Is there any answering machine available that would allow me, if I am
given a code number, to say who I am without having to listen to the
outgoing message?

Earlier this week I was in a library that has a lot of neat stuff,
including the "Telegraph and Telephone Age" magazine going way back in
time.  I was reading issues from the early 1930s.

A teenager had a reasonable enough imitation of a Western Union
delivery boy's uniform.  He fabricated telegrams and delivered them,
collect.  The story that got printed said he delivered one telegram
with 90 cents due and the customer had only a ten dollar bill.  So he
offered to take the bill and bring back the change.  Which he didn't.

An executive of a corporation was traveling overseas.  The crooks
fabricated a cablegram from him to his company, instructing them to
pay $800 on delivery of two packages he was having sent there.  The
packages were delivered and the company paid.  They turned out to
contain nothing but bottles of colored water.

Subject: Is There a Dial Helper For When We Travel?

Reply-To: gmhall@apk.net


I am getting to the point I find it hard to "dial" (press the number
keys) fast enough to suit SBC Ameritech.  Those 11-digit numbers are
hard to remember.  Sometimes I have to look back at a number when I'm
only part way through and before I can dial (press) the next number, I
am already getting the "your call did not go through" message.

Here is the situation.

We just got a prepaid calling card in the mail that would be handy to
use when we travel because you can use it from any phone.  The
microscopic print does say there is a surcharge if used from a public
phone, but sometimes a person just wants to call from a friend's house
or something.

Well, to use a calling card like this, we have to dial the toll-free
number printed on the card (in very small print), then enter a PIN
consisting of 11 digits.  Then it says we will be prompted with
instructions for dialing the number we want to call.

So, since most phones don't come with a little screen where you can
enter the numbers at your own pace and then hit Enter like on a
computer, the question is this:

Is there a dialer helper gizmo that a person could carry similar to a
palm-sized address-phonebook sort of thing where a person could enter
such numbers and then hold it up to the phone mouthpiece and press one
or two buttons and have it beep the tones into the telephone for us.

Has anyone thought about a smart phone card that can do the dialing
for us if we just put in one or two numbers instead of the 11-digit
told-free number plus the 11-digit PIN?  How about a "card reader /
number storer" that we could carry.  We could have a smaller PIN with
something like this so not just ANYONE could use it, but it would be
easier for people like me to use than what they have now when you have
to punch in all your own numbers and do it faster than we used to have
to.

One thing I really LIKE about the cell phones is the phone book built
into the phone.  If there were a gadget similar to the cell phone
phonebook that could be used with a landline phone from anywhere, that
would be nice.

It was even weirder than you describe.  City numbers were a mixture of
five- and six-digit (except for Purdue, which, as you note, was two
digits).  When my parents lived in Lafayette in the 50s, their number
was 42-6737.  After GTE switched to seven-digit numbers, their number
became 742-6737, but the initial 7 was absorbed, so you could still
dial it locally with just the six digits.

But you still couldn't dial it directly from outside Lafayette; you
had to call your local operator (Illinois Bell in my case) and ask for
"Lafayette, Indiana 742-6737."

I once asked the IBT operator for "Lafayette, Indiana 42-6737" to see
what would happen.  The Lafayette operator said it wasn't a valid
number, so I said, SEVEN-42-6737 (emphasizing the SEVEN to be sure
that the Lafayette operator heard me).  No reaction to my emphatic
SEVEN, but the call went through.

On another occasion, I asked the IBT operator for "Lafayette, Indiana
317-742-6737" to see what would happen if I included the area code.
She asked, "have you tried dialing it"?  Well, no, lady ... I can't
dial Lafayette.  Silence.  After a few moments of assorted clicks,
pops, and muttering, the Lafayette operator came on the line, and the
call went through.

> Numbers in Lafayette would be such as 34567, and I assume the
> '3' was part of some prefix.

That would have been one of the five-digit numbers, and there was no
prefix; just 3-4567.  But after GTE switched to seven-digit numbers,
3-4567 would have become 743-4567.

And if you were calling from a campus extension, you dialed 0 for an
outside line, and 1 for the campus operator!


Neal McLain
nmclain@annsgarden.com

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: University of Chicago had some
weirdness like that also. Going back into the 1940-50's there was but
a single 'switchboard' (of eight positions) to handle all incoming 
and outgoing calls, on the main number group MIDway 3-0800. Extension
numbers ran from 2100 through 8899, or around that; about 6500 extensions.
Then there were the dormitory switchboards, whose 'outside lines' were
merely extensions on the campus board, plus they had a few lines on
each dorm switchboard which were traditional 'outside lines'. The
board was massivly overcrowded and congested with calls. They finally
decided to break it up into pseudo-exchanges, by installing nine more
operator positions. 

The orginal eight positions were moved against one wall, six new
positions were put against the other wall and the 6000- 7000 series of
extensions were terminated there. This was called the 'hospitals
board' (the original was named the 'campus board'). The hospital board
got the outside lines which were numbered MUseum-4-6100 up through
6199. The two new left over positions were pushed against a third
wall, and had the 8000 series of extension numbers, and this was for
the newly created Computation Center. (In the late 1950's this was all
quite a mystery to most people.) That, roughly 500-600 extensions
received the outside series of numbers NORmal-7-4700.  All the
extensions could dial each other of course, and people in the
University of Chicago Hospitals complex or the Computation Center were
expected to give their own assigned outside numbers for callers,
respectivly, either 684-6100 or 667-4700, or the main campus which had
the 2000-3000-4000 numbers were the old 643-0800 series. A desk at the
back of the room was where the teletype machine was located; also the
'service assistant', and the clerk who posted the phone charges for
each extension, etc. And there two people back there who maintained
'telepage', the overhead paging system for the hospitals and clinics
area, which was a block west on 59th and Drexel Streets. 'Telepage'
got incoming calls from anyone dialing the single digit '7'. Those
two operators took incoming page messages, put them over the speakers
and directed page recipients to dial whatever extension. Literally,
'telepage' *never* quit speaking; pages would go on a dozen at a 
time all day. Operators reported for work at intervals throughout
the day and evening ... but it was phased out to just one person on
duty overnight from midnight to 7 AM, when things begin getting
'phased in' again with an increased staff in the morning rush period.
Sometime around 1965-70 Illinois Bell said let's get rid of this mess
and offered UC  a centrex to handle it all but they had to build
a new central office which they asked UC to help pay for. They moved
the phone room (formerly 5th floor in the admin building 5801 South
Ellis Ave) over to the 1400 block of West 61st Street in the 
basement of a building called 'Center for Continuing Education' which
was right across the alley from the new central office building Bell
had constructed, and attached to the *old* CO building used for 
everyone else in the neighborhood; the one called 'Kenwood Bell' at
61st and Kenwood; I have talked about it before here. In the 1970's
UC got rid of about 30 operators they had needed in the old phone
room, and kept about a dozen ladies experienced in operating the
little electronic consoles; that was all they needed.   PAT]

In my area (St Louis MO area), Ameritech used to change theirs every 3 
or 4 months until they were bought by SBC. Since that purchase, (what, 3 
years ago now?)the number hasn't changed. SBC's has been the same here 
since at least 1995 when I learned of it.

Pat,

Continuing somewhat off-topic, but when did the "Monday Holiday Act" come 
into effect?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Sometime in the 1970's. It turned out
that Decoration (Memorial) Day had occurred on a Wednesday, I think.
Companies and schools *only* gave the day off; they did not round it 
into a three or four day weekend like now. Nevertheless, people would
get off work on Tuesday night (maybe a bit early) then proceed to
drive four hundred miles down an expressway to visit their friends or
family, stay for several hours and several drinks, then proceed to
drive back home in a drunken stupor down the same very crowded 
expressway. Eight hundred miles of driving, several drinks and what-
ever else all in a 24 hour period. That particular Memorial Day was
especially bloody; I do not remember how many people were killed or
maimed or paralyzed for life; it was especially gruesome. Anyway,
Congress came back in to session after their own 24 hour stint of
driving hundreds of miles and partying and drinking and more driving
back home; they said that's it ... they had a long bitter argument
about which holidays to relocate to Monday. Labor Day is *always* on
the first Monday in September since it was originated in 1890. The
other two principal holidays in the summer are Memorial Day and
Independence Day. They decided the latter had too much 'history
and significance' to change from July 4, but the former -- well,
people's memories are too short anyway, it did not matter, so it
was changed to the fourth Monday in May each year (whatever date
that happens to be, so it can 'swing' between May 23 and May 30
each year. They also combined Presidents Wasington and Lincoln
into one birthday, also the second Monday in February, since that
was a reasonable compromise between February 14 and February 21
around which time both of them were born, and instead of having a
holiday for each of them (business owners were getting annoyed at
all the time off employees were getting), they put them together
on a combined ocassion called 'Presidents Day' instead of two
holidays as they had previously. Veterans Day (nee Armistace Day)
in November was changed from November 11 (static date but variable
day) to the second Monday in November. It all happened sometime in
the middle 1970's. Congressional thinking was if the guys can slip
out of work a bit early on Friday, they'll have all night to drive
to wherever, get into a drunken orgy the rest of the night and all
day Saturday/Saturday night, spend early Sunday sobering up and be
able to drive *leisurly* -- not like drunken, orgy-crazed crazy 
people Sunday afternoon and evening and get back to work on Monday
without killing several other motorists on the way. It has reduced
holiday car accidents by a large percentage.    PAT]

============================================================

JOHN MACDONALD JOINS AT&T CANADA: John A. MacDonald has joined AT&T
Canada as President and Chief Operating Officer, replacing Harry
Truderung. MacDonald was President and COO of Bell Canada in the late
1990s.

CABLECOS WANT FOREIGN OWNERSHIP LIMITS LIFTED: On November 28, the
Canadian Cable Television Association told the Commons Committee on
Canadian Heritage that foreign ownership limits should apply only to
broadcast content providers, not distribution companies. Cable TV
executives say they are prepared to structurally separate their
"content" and "carriage" businesses.

** Friends of Canadian Broadcasting told the committee that
    raising foreign ownership limits would not benefit
    consumers but would result in "a major payday" for the
    four families that own the four largest Canadian cable TV
    companies.

ROGERS, CALL-NET COMMENT ON AT&T PETITION: Call-Net and Rogers
Communications have submitted separate comments on AT&T's petition to
Cabinet (see Telecom Update #347). Neither fully supports the
petition, but both want Cabinet to strengthen competition.

** Rogers says the Price Cap regime increases ILEC profits:
    Bell Canada will benefit by $130 million over four years,
    and will use these profits to keep prices low in
    competitive areas such as satellite TV.

** Call-Net says Cabinet should direct the CRTC to actively
    promote competition in all decisions. Call-Net wants
    higher retail prices, more ILEC services available to
    competitors on a cost-plus basis, and competitor access to
    ILEC OSS systems.

http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/SSG/sf05987e.html

CITY OF OTTAWA PREPARES BROADBAND STRATEGY: A draft Broadband Access
Strategy for the City of Ottawa, released November 26, aims to make
high-speed Internet service available to all city residents. The plan
will be submitted to City Council in January, following six public
consultation meetings.

RCMP RAIDS SATELLITE DEALERS: On November 27, the RCMP raided seven
satellite TV dealers in Saskatchewan, seizing equipment they say could
be used to obtain illegal access to DirecTV, Dish Network, and Bell
ExpressVu. Similar raids were conducted recently in Winnipeg and
Montreal.

** Speaking to the International Institute of Communications
    last week, CRTC Chair Charles Dalfen called satellite
    piracy an "epidemic," with up to 700,000 illegal users in
    Canada. He plans to meet with industry reps shortly to
    explore potential courses of action.

BELL DEALERS SUE BELL: The owners of 233 Bell-branded independent
retail stores are suing Bell Canada for $80 million. The dealers say
Bell Mobility illegally and unfairly uses its direct and Internet
sales channels to offer customers deals that aren't made available
through the independent stores.

VIDEOTRON BEFORE CRTC TODAY: At a CRTC hearing today, Videotron must
show cause why the Commission should not issue a mandatory order
requiring it to abide by Broadcasting Decision 2002-255 and pay $10
million in fees it owes to sports broadcaster RDS. (See Telecom Update
#353)

222 APPLICANTS SEEK BROADBAND CASH: Industry Canada has received 222
applications in Round 1 of the competition for funding to develop
business plans for broadband infrastructure deployment in their
communities. (See Telecom Update #348)

DBRS DOWNGRADES THREE CABLECOS: Dominion Bond Rating Service has cut
its ratings for three cable companies. The credit agency now rates
Shaw as triple-B (low), Cogeco as double-B (high), and Videotron as
double-B (low). Rogers Cable remains at double-B (high).

ALIANT BUSINESS LINE RATES APPROVED: CRTC Telecom Order 2002- 443
approves Aliant's application for new single-line and multi-line
business rates and contracts in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and PEI,
effective immediately.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Orders/2002/o2002-443.htm

MTS INTROS 1XRTT: Manitoba Telecom Services has launched higher-speed
1XRTT wireless service in Winnipeg. The company says the technology
provides mobile data communications at 86 Kbps, and may provide 144
Kbps in future.

TELUS MOBILITY OFFERS PREPAID FEATURES: Telus Mobility has introduced
prepaid cards for various PCS features, including voice mail, text
messaging, and wireless games.

OTTAWA SEEKS EXTENDED LOCAL CALLING: The City of Ottawa has asked Bell
Canada, "on a priority basis," to conduct an economic study to
determine the cost of expanding local calling throughout all exchanges
wholly or partly within Ottawa city limits.

ePHONE OPENS CANADIAN OPERATION: ePhone Telecom, a Virginia- based
company that provides Internet-based long distance has established a
Canadian point of presence in Toronto, and begun offering prepaid
calling services through Canadian dealers.

TELECOM SERVICE - BAD AND GETTING WORSE: "Across Canada, business
customers report a significant deterioration in everything from order
accuracy to on-time delivery to sales rep knowledge and
helpfulness. And it's going to get worse."  Ian and Lis Angus explain
why the service crisis exists and what business customers should do
about it in the latest issue of Telemanagement.

** Also in this issue: an exclusive evaluation of the latest
    release of Nortel's IP-PBX, and an update on
    videoconferencing products and services.

Thank you for the reply and the hint towards a company to look at. Yes
I would be looking at a point to multipoint solution. Kind of like the
LMDS or even AT&T project angel type of setup.

The people in the area are paying around $60 a month for cellular
service acting like a dial up service, I.E. unlimited local calls etc,
they are also able to connect to the internet, but the speeds are very
very slow, due to the type of coverage they have. They are on the very
edge of system coverage, hence service is not quite the best they can
have.  I used to work in the wireless field, but where I am at now
(Fairbanks) it is really small to have a lot of carriers. But I do
know there are ways to give these guys better coverage then they are
getting now. So what I want to do is show these people that they can
pool together to help pay for the cost of extended reliable service
into their area.

Depends what you want to do.  There are point-to-point microwave
telephone repeaters intended for providing phone service in remote
points.  I go to a summer camp on an island off the coast of New
Hampshire that uses them to get remote phone service from the mainland
10 miles away.  It has to be line of sight; I don't know how possible
it would be to daisy chain multiple units if you have a bunch of
people down the line.

For Internet data, you can go surprisingly long distances with WiFi
wireless and carefully aimed antennas, again needing line of sight.
You can definitely daisy chain those.

You might have a chat with your state public utililty commission.  The
Universal Service Fund exists specifically to subsidize expensive rural
service like yours, and your telco should be able to take advantage of
it.

You might do a little looking into point to point optical (laser)
links.  There are a bunch of startup companies in this field who are
looking to provide solutions for the "last mile" fiber optics problem,
temporary links or emergency communications between rooftops or
skyscraper office windows, and so on.  The technology involved is
actually quite simple, especially at low data rates, with ranges from
a few to perhaps 20 km depending on the terrain, weather, required
level of reliability, and similar considerations.

The company I know the most about is Terabeam
(http://www.terabeam.com).  They may not be of direct interest to you
because they're focused on the higher priced, high data rate, shorter
range end of the market, but you could Google on them and go from
there.

%T   "IPSec: Securing VPNs"

Chapter one is an overview of TCP/IP.  The material is generally good,
but does demonstrate a possible weakness of the book: we are provided
with way too much information about a number of areas that are not
relevant to IPSec.  A similar overabundance of detail (and math)
describes symmetric cryptography, in chapter two.  Oddly, given the
level of particulars in other areas, there is no analysis of the
weakness of double DES (Data Encryption Standard).  Operational
specifics of the various AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) candidates
are also included.  The mathematical basis of asymmetric cryptography,
in chapter three, is not explained as well as symmetric is.  In
dealing with hashes and message authentication codes, chapter four has
lots of math and almost no other discussion.  Chapter five provides
extensive details about X.509 attribute fields, for digital
certificates, and also has a bit of material on PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy) and key recovery.  The fields of LDAP (Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol) are outlined in chapter six.

Chapter seven finally talks, very briefly, about IPSec architecture,
repeating (from chapter one) the specifics of the IP header, and
mentioning some of the components of IPSec.  Chapters eight, nine, and
ten concentrate of the header structure of AH (Authentication Header),
ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload), and ISAKMP (Internet Security
Association Key Management Protocol) packets, albeit chapter ten also
covers a bit of the handshaking process.  There is very little
discussion of strengths and weaknesses.  There are lots of details
related to IKE (Internet Key Exchange) in chapter eleven, but
surprisingly little information about what it does or how it works.
The header structure and options for the compression function, IPComp,
are given in chapter twelve.  Chapter thirteen is supposed to talk
about implementation, but has a fairly generic example of a VPN and
some screen shots from a commercial product.

Overall, the book contains lots of technical details, but very little
in the way of explanation, discussion, or analysis.  You would
probably learn just as much about IPSec by reading the RFCs
themselves.

I could see a use -- where a phone foreign (i.e. you do not control)
to you has its number blocked in such a way as it cannot be un-blocked
by a prefix (is this possible?).  If you could call out on such a
phone, you could then discover the number.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Phones that are 'hardwired' blocked, 
or blocked by default (as opposed to using *67 on a case by case
basis) can be unblocked on the same case by case basis; I think *87
is how to do it, or maybe *82. Read your local phone directory info
pages for specific details. Anyway, I do not think 'blocking' occurs
at that point when dialing into a *TELCO SPONSORED/PROVIDED* read
back number, which is the only kind you could use if you had no idea
what the number was; by being on premises for one reason or another
and dialing into the telco-provided service.   PAT]

Here in St. Louis-land (Missouri) *67 does not interfere with the
number announcement.

Yes. The 800 number does not pay any attention to "blocking" since it
reads back ANI, not CNID. The line used for CNID readback has Privacy
Manager, so to even get to the machine, one has to get past the PM
sentry, which gives a one-touch option to release the blocking.

Internet Society Announces Ed Juskevicius from Nortel Networks as New
Chairman of Advisory Council

WASHINGTON, D.C. - December 2, 2002 - The Internet Society (ISOC)
today announced that telecommunications industry veteran Ed
Juskevicius is the new chairman of the Society's Advisory Council.
The Advisory Council represents ISOC's organization members, which
include representatives from academic, research, and international
organizations; service/equipment suppliers, content providers,
government, and public interest groups.

"The Advisory Council is an important part of ISOC's structure and we
are very fortunate to have someone of Ed's caliber chairing it.  Ed
has shown significant leadership within the council and we are looking
forward to working with him in his new role," said Lynn St.Amour, ISOC
CEO/President.

Juskevicius -- currently senior manager, Technology and Standards,
Nortel Networks -- has worked in the telecommunications industry since
1981, focusing on data communications products and standards for
public carrier and private enterprise networks, including: ISDN, Frame
Relay, ATM, xDSL and VoIP.  His current interest areas include
Security and Management aspects of networks and deployment of
broadband Internet access technologies, as well as societal issues
affecting how people use and benefit from the Internet - today and in
the future.

In discussing his new role with ISOC, he reminds us that we are still
in the early days of Internet deployment and uptake, with much to be
done before getting even 50% of humanity to benefit from the Net.
"Living in North America, it is all too easy to forget that most of
the world has yet to experience the Internet, and yet very few of us
(in our western households) had Net access just 5 years ago."

"As members of ISOC, we need to be aware of all the issues, not just
the technologies, needed for the Net to fulfill its ultimate
potential.  This is ambitious and will be a lightening rod as some
believe it's unrealistic to expect global Net access for all,"
according to Juskevicius.

"As an Advisory Council, we need to continually ask ourselves 'What's next?'
It is our mission is to explore issues impacting the Internet - such as
education, public policy, standards, digital rights, privacy and security --
and recommend ways to resolve them.  Given ISOC's strong base of
organization members, and the caliber of the people on the Advisory Council,
I am optimistic that we will help everyone to benefit from the Net," he
explained.

well, the simplest thing would probably be to get your friend to
change the outgoing message to something short and easy, like:

	good day. please leave your message. thank you

		or

	good day. you've reached [number]. please lv your msg. thank you.

Alternatively, you might try hitting the " # #" or " * " key. Many
(but certainly not all) answering machines use that as a break-through
for this exact purpose.


Knowledge may be power, but communications is the key

Many machines, particularly digital ones, will stop the outgoing
message and start recording if you press *, #, or occasionally 0.  Try
it -- his machine may already do that.

Most of the newer answering machines will let you press the star (*)
or pound/hash/octothorpe (#) key to immediately go to message
recording.  If he's screening his calls he should be able to hear you
leaving a message and newer machines will automatically cut out when
he lifts the receiver to talk.  Many people leave an instruction in
their message at the beginning of their outgoing message letting
people know if they want to leave a message immediately they can press
the appropriate key. 

Replies are seldom read.  Please reply in the group.

Some (not all) answering machines will recognize a TT digit and stop the
OGM and switch to incoming immediately.  My panasonics use "*"

See if your friends TAD has such a feature.

There used to be such things.  I had a "Texas Instruments Phone
Dialer" about 10 years ago which I used for just this purpose.
http://www.datamath.org/Personal/ProDialer.htm shows a similar one,
and states that TI stopped making them after a few years.

I believe some of the earlier pocket computers (Psion?) could also do
this, but don't know if the facility is still available.

I suspect that's what killed the demand for the dialers.  I didn't

Such a device already exists.  It's called a pocket tone dialer.  The
cheaper ones will only enter the tones as you punch them while holding
to the transmitter end of the handset, but fancier ones will store
strings of digits where you could enter a calling card PIN or bank
account numbers, etc.  Do a google search for "pocket tone dialer."
One entry has one for ~$13 which will hold a 17 number string.  There
may be others that will hold longer strings.

Hi Gail ...

Go see a Radio Shack (or perhaps Sharper Image or a Spencer store).
Radio Shack used to have little dialer gizmos that you could store
telephone numbers in and then, holding the things speaker up to the
telephone handset, have the thing "squirt" out the number with the
press of a button or two.  You can probably program in the access
number under one button (or name), the 11 digit PIN (under another
button or name) and numbers for your most frequently called pals.
Likely dialing would be easier and you could beat SBC at their own
game!

A reminder of the difference between CID and ANI.  It's easy to
identify most common POTS lines in use in a home or small office by
calling your own digital cell phone.  This fails with any
caller-ID-blocked number, and various PBX or other business schemes.

That's why John has an 800 number that he's not sharing with us, that
has real-time ANI feedback.  The ANI should be difficult to block.  I
used to have a fax mailbox that supplied non-real-time ANI.  The ANI
was available the next day in a report.  That was pretty handy, but a
little slow for normal usage.

Downloading music isn't necessarily a crime.  Under even the most
limited interpretation of "fair use", ownership of a physical
"official" medium gives an unlimited perpetual license to the personal
enjoyment of its contents.  It can be copied to a cassette or an MP3
player or ripped onto a computer, to be used in a car, a gym, or at a
desk.  Furthermore, CD ownership confers the right to download
portions for use at the owner's convenience.

If the midshipmen were using the Navy's network to distribute music to
a large number of strangers, then the RIAA might have a case.  But if
the midshipmen were making otherwise acceptable use of the network,
the onus is on the RIAA to first show probable cause and then to prove
that the downloaders didn't have a license to the material they
downloaded at the time they downloaded it.

The best answer, in my opinion, is to stop buying recorded music and 
deprive the record companies of the funds they need to pursue their self-
destructive, unjustifiable, and inconsistent legal theories.  Most of the 
stuff they're selling is garbage anyway.

The key to the implementation of any rights management scheme is the
removal of alternatives. Even the DiVX people realized this when they
tried to choke off unlimited-play DVD by getting studios to sign
exclusive marketing contracts.

Unfortunately for DiVX, it didn't take long for those studios to notice 
that the public grabbed up the DVDs and ignored the DiVX players and 
discs. Seems the public would rather pay four times the price of a DiVX 
disc to get features and the ability to play them as they pleased. 
Another problem was that the pedestrian DiVX players cost more than 
better-equipped standard DVD players. No one told the DiVX promoters 
what Gillette learned early on: give away the razor.

This is something the RIAA and the record companies have yet to learn:
give the public what it wants and there is no limit to the money you
can make. I am beginning to realize that the RIAA actually believes
its own nonsense about "piracy causing loss of sales". How about "not
selling the product the public wants to buy" as a possibility for
stagnant sales?

I recently attempted to understand my cellphone plan. I should have
left unwell enough alone. Mea cellular culpa. I thought I had a simple
question about my new plan: Why the heck did I receive a bill for more
than $500? Here's how I remember the conversation with a
customer-sometimes-care representative (CSCR).

Me: Good morning (mistake). I am an existing customer and just 
received a $500 bill. I think there's a mistake and would like some 
help.

The $19,450 Phone
By MARK LEVINE

Although the Beverly Hills retail outlet of a newly christened 
company called Vertu is situated on a stretch of Rodeo Drive whose 
storefronts are occupied by Chanel, Cartier, Harry Winston, Bernini, 
Van Cleef & Arpels and Lladro, Vertu is, by design, concealed from 
the sights of window-shoppers. You can reach Vertu either through a 
rear alley or by walking straight through the Hugo Boss showroom, 
past the scrutinizing gaze of that store's nattily dressed sales 
crew, to the back entrance of the building, which is marked by an 
austere gray banner bearing nothing more than the name of the company 
and a logo that looks like an abstract rendering of a raptor's 
outstretched wings. 

Vertu is one flight up. It is generally open to the public by
appointment only, and the hushed vacancy of its 3,500 square feet is
broken only by the strains of ethereal New Age music.  One corner of
the room displays commissioned art from the British photographer
Christopher Bucklow -- ghostly silhouettes of human figures that
resemble vividly tinted M.R.I.'s. The art is not for sale. It does,
however, prepare the visitor for an encounter with Vertu's specialized
and highly self-conscious vocabulary of shopping.  Initiates refer to
the store as a 'client suite,' to the service that Vertu's product
delivers as 'the experience' and to the product itself -- the
world's first custom-built luxury cellphone -- as 'the instrument.'

California Firm to Settle Net Porn Scam
By REUTERS

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A California billing firm has agreed to give up
$1.6 million to settle charges that it improperly billed thousands for
Internet pornography, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday.

Privately held billing firm Integretel Inc. and its subsidiary eBillit
prompted thousands of complaints in September 2000 after they placed
charges of up to $4,000 on consumers' home telephone bills without
their knowledge.

Consumers incurred the charges after visiting a Web site run by U.K.
firm Verity International Ltd. that offered pornographic movies, the
FTC said.

Visitors were instructed to download special software which unplugged
their Internet connection and routed it through the African island
nation of Madagascar at a rate of $3.99 per minute. Notification of
the charge was buried in a series of 11 screens, said FTC attorney
Lawrence Hodapp.

Integretel placed charges averaging $127 each on consumers'
long-distance phone bills, even if the person on the phone bill was
not the one who downloaded the movies.

Subject: Nokia v Microsoft/The Fight For Digital Dominance


 From The Economist print edition

IT MAY look like a mobile telephone, but the Orange SPV, launched last
month, is much more than that. With its colour screen, garish icons
and musical ringtones, it resembles other handsets on the market. But
it has one far more significant feature: the software inside,
indicated by a familiar-looking four-coloured logo on its screen. For
the SPV is the first "Windows-powered smartphone"-in other words, it
runs software from Microsoft. It is the software giant's attempt to
stake its claim in the new market created by the convergence of mobile
phones and computers. It is no less than a declaration of war.

The market for smartphones is still small. But it is growing fast, as
new features are added to handsets, making them ever smarter. Of the
400m mobile phones that will be sold this year, around 16m will have
built-in cameras. Nokia, the world's largest handset maker, expects to
sell 50m-100m colour-screen handsets next year. A new report from
Analysys, an industry consultancy, predicts that by 2007 nearly 300m
Europeans will be carrying handsets with colour screens, cameras,
music players, support for downloadable games, and other features that
are now available only in the most advanced models. Such features are
already common in Japan and South Korea, and they are starting to
appear in Europe and America. These advanced handsets are, in effect,
pocket computers-but they have emerged from the consumer-electronics
industry rather than the world of computing.

By putting new technologies, such as digital photography and
electronic messaging, into consumers' hands in an easy-to-use form,
the new handsets seem to be succeeding where the PC has failed.
Mobile phones have a far broader appeal than PCs (see chart 1). The
lone exception is North America, where PC ownership exceeds
mobile-phone ownership. But even there phones are catching up.

Subject: Smartphones and Handheld Computers/Computing's New Shape


 From The Economist print edition

"A COMPUTER on every desk and in every home." This was Microsoft's
mission statement for many years, and it once sounded visionary and
daring. But today it seems lacking in ambition. What about a computer
in every pocket? Sure enough, Microsoft has recently amended its
statement: its goal is now to "empower people through great software,
anytime, any place on any device". Being chained to your desktop is
out: mobility is in. The titan of the computer industry has set its
sights on an entirely new market.

It is not alone. This week Dell, the world's largest PC maker,
launched its first handheld computers, which run Microsoft's Pocket PC
software. HP and Palm, which also make handheld computers, have just
unveiled new models, with far more emphasis on wireless networking and
telephony. And in an even more portentous move, the SPV, the first
device to run Microsoft's special version of Windows for mobile
phones, has just been launched in Europe by Orange, a mobile operator.

As the computer industry tries to cram PCs into pocket-sized devices,
the mobile-phone industry has arrived at the same point-but from the
opposite direction. The latest phones announced by Nokia, the world's
largest handset maker, include one model with a folding keyboard aimed
at business users, as well as a colourful phone that plays computer
games. Digital cameras, already a popular feature of mobile phones in
Japan, are starting to appear elsewhere. Colour screens are spreading
fast. The latest phones have as much computing power as a desktop
computer did ten years ago.

In Media Res
By PAUL KRUGMAN

This week Al Gore said the obvious. "The media is kind of weird these
days on politics," he told The New York Observer, "and there are some
major institutional voices that are, truthfully speaking, part and
parcel of the Republican Party."

The reaction from most journalists in the "liberal media" was
embarrassed silence. I don't quite understand why, but there are some
things that you're not supposed to say, precisely because they're so
clearly true.

The political agenda of Fox News, to take the most important example,
is hardly obscure. Roger Ailes, the network's chairman, has been
advising the Bush administration. Fox's Brit Hume even claimed credit
for the midterm election. "It was because of our coverage that it
happened," he told Don Imus. "People watch us and take their electoral
cues from us. No one should doubt the influence of Fox News in these
matters." (This remark may have been tongue in cheek, but imagine the
reaction if the Democrats had won and Dan Rather, even jokingly, had
later claimed credit.)

But my purpose in today's column is not to bash Fox. I want to address
a broader question: Will the economic interests of the media undermine
objective news coverage?

Cell phone maker Sony Ericsson needs to bring out new products soon 
if it wants to halt a devastating sales decline, Gartner Dataquest 
said Tuesday as it published third-quarter handset sales statistics.

The market researcher's numbers showed that Sony Ericsson, a joint 
venture between Swedish mobile equipment maker Ericsson and Japanese 
consumer electronics giant Sony sold only 5 million cell phones 
worldwide in the third quarter.

This compares with more than 8.5 million sold by Ericsson and Sony 
before the merger, in the same quarter a year ago. The venture's 
market share dwindled to 4.8 percent from an estimated 8.8 percent.

Nov. 29 - At first glance, software executive John Baron would seem to
be a cellphone company's dream. He subscribes to the slow Internet
browsing option on his cellphone, painfully pecking away on the dial
pad to type in Web addresses. Lately, though, he has found a better
way: When on the road, he uses Wi-Fi, the technology that gives him
wireless access to the Internet on his laptop computer, at blazing
speeds. "It's brilliant," he says. "The phone stuff is pretty clunky."

ONCE VIEWED as little more than a toy for tech hobbyists, Wi-Fi -
short for wireless fidelity - is starting to emerge as a serious force
in the Internet business. Chip maker Intel Corp. is integrating it
into new microprocessors it's building for laptop computers. Philips
Electronics NV is planning to build it into remote controls and stereo
systems. And Dell Computer Corp. is similarly seeding its PCs with
Wi-Fi. Airports, hotels and Starbucks Corp.  outlets are increasingly
awash in Wi-Fi radio signals.

      - Dec 2, 2002 12:20 AM (AP Online)

WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers say increased cell phone use has led to
more crashes caused by drivers on the phone, but the value people
place on being able to call from the road roughly equals the
accidents' cost.

Opponents of banning cell phone usage by drivers have cited studies
that showed the benefit of car calls outweighed the toll from such
accidents _ medical bills and property damage, for example.

Harvard researchers, drawing on previous research involving cell
phones and government figures for auto accidents, says in a study
there is a growing public health risk from the reliance on cell phones
in cars. The number of cell phone subscribers has grown from 94
million in 2000 to more than 128 million.

This 'hold' *is* supposed to happen.  When the original transaction is
performed, the authorization request is sent to the issuer.  (Problem 1:
if the transaction amount is below the merchant's floor limit, the
transaction may not go online.)  The transaction amount should be added
to the blocked amount on the card account.  Later, usually at the end of
day, the financial request should be sent.  (Problem 2: this may not be
for the same amount as the auth request.)  When the issuer receives the
financial, it should deduct the amount of the transaction from the
account, and deduct the amount of the corresponding auth request from
the blocked amount.

If this is done properly, then the bank is never left holding the bag.
This, from the bank's point of view, is a Good Thing.

It's slightly worse from the customer's point of view.  The pay-at-pump
petrol (gas) stations usually authorize a relatively large amount (often
$60 or so in the UK), and then send in the financial for the smaller
amount representing the fuel purchased.  A delay in sending in the
financial can harm your credit!

That's right -- the square-button handset had LED lighting.  There are
at least three variants of the round-button version -- the first,
called the 1220, had only ten buttons (like other early Touch-Tone
phones) and a clear plastic (over dark gray) plate with the letters
for each digit; the second version, the 2220, was the same but with 12
buttons; and the third (don't have the number) was a 2220 with a metal
plate rather than plastic.  The rotary handset was called the 220A.

No, they were the same size and shape, and were interchangeable.  A
little known fact is that the Trimlines were (at least in some cases)
stocked as components rather than complete sets, so the installer
would draw a Touch-Tone or rotary handset, a desk (AD1) or wall (AC1)
base, a handset cord and a mounting cord (for desk sets) to suit each
work order -- one job might call for a 220A handset, AD1 base, 7'
handset cord and 7' mounting cord, all green, while the next might be
for a 2220B handset, AC1 base and 14' handset cord, all white.  This
was practical because the Trimline had an early form of modular cords;
with conventional sets the installer might have to take the phone
apart to convert to longer cords if requested, but with the Trimline
this wasn't necessary (something that no doubt convinced Western
Electric to go to modular cords for all phones in the 1970s).  The
Trimline desk base even used a special five-wire mounting cord (the
fifth wire was white) that could be hooked up at the connecting block
or four-prong plug to work on single- or two-party lines, again
without having to take the base apart to rewire it.

What company? You really can dial 61 2 xxxx xxxx and reach a number in

Subject: Business Line vs Residential Line (in Kentucky)
Date: 2 Dec 2002 02:46:36 -0800
Organization: http://groups.google.com/


Here is a question, when I move soon the local phone company (Alltech)
is a real stickler about making sure home businesses pay for a
business listing. When I last lived in this community (ten years ago)
I was really a full time employee of a company in another city in
Kentucky, so I had a paystub to prove it and all I had to do was lie
and say I commuted ninety miles to work every day.

This time the worm has turned and I have no paystub and no way to
prove I work outside the home; however, because a listed phone number
did not generate any additional business for me, I am planning to go
back to using an unlisted unpublished phone number. It doesn't seem
fair to me that a very nonpublic business should have to pay for a
business listing. I have a residential and a fax/modem line and I am
sure I still use the phone less than a residential family with two
teenaged sons and two teenaged daughters? I am thinking there has to
be a way around this inanity without simply putting the phone in my
mother-in-laws name (who will live with us). I want it in my name so I
can use the expense as a tax deduction along with the money we pay for
the expense of a home office.

Along that line I suppose it could be argued why not have the
additional deduction of paying for a business line. I am not sure if
that would be a plus or not. All I do know is it would increase my
monthly phone bill from around $150 to possibly $200, as it is now I
will still have to pay an additional $100 per month or more just so my
clients in nearby Louisville will not have to pay a long distance fee
to call me.  I am wondering whom I could ask about this kind of thing?

By no means am I an expert but I'll have a go.

Rotary dial Trimline phones were all wider then Touchtone version. WE
designed a special rotary dial but I assume it could not be made as
narrow as a Touchtone pad.

Early Trimline phones has an incandescent bulb powered by a 6v
transformer on the second pair. Later versions used an LED powered
from the phone line.

My take on it was that in the olden days (any date prior to 1967 for
me) a big feast such as Thanksgiving needed to be held outside.  By
the end of November my picnic table has about a dozen centemeters of
ice and snow on it, so that's out.

Also, I always thought the shorter growing season up here meant we
needed another month of praying before winter set it :-)

Nope, Memorial Day is the last Monday in May (one of May 25-31).

Presidents Day is the third Monday in February (15-21).  The dates
it replaced were Feb. 12 (Lincoln) and 22 (Washington).

Columbus Day was also changed to a Monday, though only federal civil

Increased enforcement may deserve part of the credit for that.  Still,
it's an improvement for those of us who like to use the long weekends
for travel.

I think you'll find that Easter falls on the first Sunday following the
first *FULL* moon (not new moon) after the Spring equinox.

On the switches that we used ... darn, can't even remember the
manufacturer, much less the model ... One of the options was to block
CID, and not allow the user to bypass it on a call-by-call basis.
This was a Centrex feature offered by my CLEC.

I wonder if that would still work with the Privacy Manager, as John
mentions his usage.

All-in-One (AIO) HP printer 2210 set for automatic fax answering is
supposed to eavesdrop on the incoming call answered by the telephone
answering machine (TAM). If it detects fax tones on the line, it takes
over the call. This action shuts off the TAM.

My AIO does not seems to detect fax tones. I now it monitors the line
because if the incoming fax call is answered on a phone, before the
TAM answers, pressing 1,2,3 on the pad will switch the AIO to fax
reception (as it is meant to do)

I would like to hear from someone who had similar problems and how
they were solved. Is it a problem of line ?

Jay, the TAM (telephone answering machine) indeed drop the DC voltage
when it connects but when a phone or the fax connect, it drops again
and thia is what tells the TAm to shut off

Our "Remembrance Day" is the same day every year: November 11th, to
coincide with the Armistice.  It is NOT a statutory holiday, though. 
(But it should be.)

We share many holidays in common, but there's a few differences. 
Major holidays include:

New Year's Day - January 1st
Heritage Day - February 18th this year, think it's 3rd Monday in Feb
Good Friday - variable, same as yours
Victoria Day - third Monday in May (named after Queen)
St. Jean-Baptiste Day (Quebec only) - 4th Monday in June
Canada Day - July 1st (equivalent to Independence Day)
Civic Holiday(*) - first Monday in August
Labour Day - first Monday in September
Thanksgiving Day - second Monday in October
Remembrance Day - November 11th (NOT a statutory holiday)
Christmas Day - December 25th
Boxing Day - December 26th (NOT a statutory holiday)

(*) Now, this is all rather general and represents a mix of "federal"
and "provincial" holidays - these can all vary province to province.
"Heritage Day", for example, is called "Family Day" in Alberta,
whereas the (optional) civic holiday in August is called, strangely,
"Heritage Day".  Some of them are not statutory: Remembrance Day and
Boxing Day, for example.  Many employers DO give Remembrance Day off
(or an additional day at Christmas in lieu of), but it's not
mandatory.  Similarly, many employers offer a 4-day weekend for Good
Friday and Easter Monday: only the former is, strictly speaking, a
stat holiday.  Some provinces and territories do NOT observe Victoria
Day (Northwest Territories, Nunavut, New Brunswick, possibly others).
Nova Scotia has a half-day holiday on Christmas Eve.  It's all quite
involved and perplexing.  For more info, a good place to visit would

Beats the heck out of me; the Pilgrims celebrated the first Thanksgiving

His job title is Director of the Information Awareness Office, which 
suggests that, in fact, he will.

That man shouldn't be allowed within a thousand feet of any government
building, never mind put in a position of responsibility or authority.
The only way he can tell the difference between the Constitution and a

Similar to Ureach, my USADatanet 800 service delivers realtime ANI as
CNID when someone calls me via that service. Quite convenient but then
I'm paying for the call and have a right to know who's calling.

In Verizon (New England Region) land it's *82 - which doesn't work from 
the G3i at the office. Punching 9+1182+number works some of the time, 
not all. I've got a spare trunk card, and four spare lines but admin 
hasn't given me the ok to unblock them and set the system up so that 9+ 
gets an outside line blocked, 8+ will get an unblocked line. 

To activate Anonymous Call Rejection here you dial *77, with *87 
deactivating the service.

Try this number: 1-800-222-0300 (press "1" for English).

This is the customer service number for AT&T. It reads back your
number back to verify that "you call is regarding ..." before offering
choices.

At least AT&T is good for something, even if it isn't long distance.

Just to be clear, I'm not withholding the number to be a pill. It is
just that I lack the resources the subsidize a public number readback
line. The number is capped at four simultaneous calls, and the number
is used for something else (as its "day job"). There is a back-door
sequence that must be entered to coax the IVR into coughing up the
number you are calling from.

But it is a very effective and reliable readback. BTW, from time to
time, inadvertent number readbacks appear that are associated with
other services. AT&T may still have one that reads back the number you
are calling from in association with some other service it
provides. Memory fails as to what it was all about, but you could call
in, get the number read back to you, and then just abandon the call.

Mike Sandman still sells a tone dialer:

Ah, nostalgia! The Radio Shack memory pocket tone dialer was a very
popular item with phreaks in the early 1990s. You could replace the
included xtal with a 6.5536MHz (or, if you were a purist, you could
order through 2600 Magazine one of BernieS' custom-made 6.49MHz) xtal,
and voila--you had an instant red box! Obviously, as a teen, I'd never
have made such a thing... ;)

Last year, citing poor sales, Radio Shack discontinued this item --
much to my disappointment. You might find a used one somewhere, but
die-hard phreaks bought up most of the remaining inventory when they
went on clearance.

  From: newsletter@nocards.org
  Subject: Past press coverage of Auto-ID radio frequency tags

We have all been wondering why more "regular consumers" have not heard
about Auto-ID radio frequency identification and tracking technology.
Why doesn't the whole world know about these plans to plant tiny
tracking devices in the products we buy?  It's not that the press
hasn't been covering it -- they have, but as a tech story, not a
consumer story.

Here is a compendium of news stories from the last two years.  Each of
the references cited is an actual quote from the press.  The quoted
comments can be found verbatim at the websites listed.  Much of the
information cited in our overview article
(http://www.nocards.org/AutoID/overview.shtml) came from these
sources.

==============================

The greatest technological revolution to shape the consumer goods
industry since the appearance of the barcode has begun. Ironically, it
couples a technology that has been around for decades--radio frequency
identification -- with highly miniaturized computers that will enable
products to be identified and tracked at any point along the supply
chain.  The new technological wave is a development of the Auto-ID
Center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which was
established in 1999.  [snip]

"The fundamental problem in tracing and counting is identification,"
explains Kevin Ashton, director of the Auto-ID Center.  "If we can't
identify a thing, then we can't count or track it".... Ashton began
championing the idea of embedding tiny wireless computers in nearly
every product made.

http://www.chaindrugreview.com/articles/tech_revolution.html

==============================

The MIT-based Auto-ID Center [is] a consortium of academic and
industry scientists seeking to replace bar codes with a system that
tracks manufactured products with pervasive grids of readers in
warehouses, trucks, stores, and the home. Once the infrastructure is
operational, companies will be able to determine the whereabouts of
all their products, all the time.

http://www.rand.org/scitech/stpi/ourfuture/Internet/sec4_networked.html

==============================

The ultimate goal is to put a radio tag on virtually every
manufactured item, each tracked by a network of millions of readers in
shops, factories, trucks, warehouses and homes.

http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/schmidt0301.asp

==============================

 From the Auto-ID (MIT) website:

Auto-ID technology will change the world by merging bits and atoms
together to form one seamless network that interacts with the real
world in real time. Physical objects will have embedded intelligence
that will allow them to communicate with each other and with
businesses and consumers. Auto-ID technology offers an automated,
numeric system of smart objects that revolutionizes the way we
manufacture, sell, and buy products.

An Electronic Product Code (ePC) is embedded onto individual products
and physical objects on memory chips known as "smart tags" that
connect objects to the Internet. Auto-ID technology will allow the
Internet to extend to everyday objects. Everything will be connected
in a dynamic, automated supply chain that joins businesses and
consumers together in a mutually beneficial relationship.

http://www.autoidcenter.org/technology.asp

Consumers, businesses, and products will interact in a dynamic cycle
of computer bits and human atoms that will understand each
other. Auto-ID technology will create order and balance in a chaotic
world.  http://www.autoidcenter.org/applications.asp

Auto-ID technology and will forever change global business. Companies
who understand what's coming will benefit dramatically.

==============================

The ePC (electronic product code) is a numbering scheme that can
provide unique ID for any physical object in the world -- each pack of
cigarettes, can of soda, light bulb or package of razor blades has a
separate ID number.

http://www.retailsystemsreseller.com/archive/Nov01/Nov01_5.shtml

==============================

The ePC code ... goes way beyond identifying products. The ePC assigns
a unique number to every single item that rolls off a manufacturing
line. (e.g. Every single bottle of soda would have its own unique ePC
number) ... It is capable of uniquely numbering every item produced
on the planet well into the future.

http://www.eretailnews.com/Features/0105epc1.htm

==============================

The creation of an algorithm for uniquely identifying a commercial
product by its "smart" electronic tag marks a crucial step towards
realizing a physically linked world; it provides the basic
infrastructure needed to support advanced versions of global
supply-chain management.

http://www.nikkeibp.asiabiztech.com/nea/200104/inet_127161.html

==============================

RFID tags are built into objects like food, clothes, drugs or
auto-parts, and read by devices in the environment, e.g., in shelves,
floors, doors.  [snip] Electronic tags, when coupled to a reader
network, allow continuous tracking and identification of physical
resources.

http://xml.coverpages.org/ni2001-11-21-c.html

==============================

Tagged pill bottles in a medicine cabinet could allow doctors to
monitor patient compliance with prescriptions, remotely.

http://www.rand.org/scitech/stpi/ourfuture/Internet/sec4_networked.html

==============================

The new system will be applied to almost any manufactured item, from
foodstuffs to washing machines. Each product will in effect carry its
own unique "messages" around with it in the form of an embedded
chip. For example, a carton of spaghetti could "tell" a truck to
deliver it, "tell" a shop that it had been bought, and then "tell" a
microwave how to cook it.  " 'Intelligent' and fully traceable
products could become a low cost reality within the next few years,"
said Mr. Ashton (in early 2001)

http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/tt/2001/jan24/auto.html

==============================

The cost of the embedded ID units has fallen dramatically over the
past two years, making the implementation of the technology more
practical and cost-effective than ever before. The chips, which cost
$1 in 1998, have dropped to less than 5 cents each and are predicted
to cost less than 1 cent by 2004.

http://www.eyeforpharma.com/index.asp?news=2822

==============================

At the center of the Auto-ID system is the RF ID tag.  [snip] The
Auto-ID center's Ashton describes the tag as "somewhere between the
size of a grain of sand and a speck of dust."

http://www.internetweek.com/newslead01/lead111901.htm

==============================

"We'll put a radio frequency ID tag on everything that moves in the
North American supply chain," says Mr. Van Fleet [of International
Paper]. He said anywhere from 2 percent to 7 percent of products are
stolen or misplaced during distribution, and the new smart tags will
let companies like his track them down on a per-item basis.

[snip]

Power Paper Ltd. of Israel is collaborating with International Paper
to combine its flat, flexible battery with a microchip that can be put
into interactive packages. International Paper estimates that more
than 500 million smart packages will be used within three years to
sell everything from French fries to electronics. Says Baruch Levanon,
head of Power Paper, "Most of the technology for smart packages
already exists. We just need to integrate it."

http://www.csmonitor.com/durable/2001/03/29/fp13s1-csm.shtml

==============================

Tulsa, Oklahoma is the site of this summer's (2001) most innovative
experiment in inventory management ... The Auto-ID Center is wiring the
entire city with analog radio-frequency gear that can track packages
equipped with microchips. The system will make it possible to track
inventory as it moves from point to point across the city. "We're
putting RFID [radio-frequency identification] chips on everything that
moves." [snip] The Auto-ID Center's vision is for [product]
identification numbers [to] be transmitted by RFID tags to a global
network of receivers along the supply chain-at airports, seaports,
highways, distribution centers, and retail stores.

http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle?doc_id=IWK20010618S0001

==============================

 ... the widespread implementation of RFID technology could mean a
leap forward, owing to the ability of RFID tags to be read without
actually being in view. Bar code labels, by comparison, must be seen
in order to be scanned.

==============================

Hitachi Europe is looking at the banknote market. The company's
Information Systems Group has developed a smart tag chip called
Minimum Meu, which measures 0.3mm square and is just 60 microns thick:
about the thickness of a human hair.  "A banknote is about 100 microns
thick, so the chip could be put inside one," says Peter Jones, the
company's pre-sales manager. Mass-production of the new chip will
start within a year. It has "attracted a lot of interest and will be a
very cost-effective solution," says Mr Jones. [snip]

In China smart tags are being developed to identify people for tax and
insurance purposes.

http://news.ft.com/ft/gx.cgi/ftc?pagename=View&c=Article&cid=FT30414MGWC

==============================

The European Central Bank is working with technology partners on a
hush-hush project to embed radio frequency identification tags into
the very fibers of euro bank notes by 2005.  In theory, an RFID tag's
ability to read and write information to a bank note could make it
very difficult, for example, for kidnappers to ask for "unmarked"
bills. Further, a tag would give governments and law enforcement
agencies a means to literally "follow the money" in illegal
transactions.  The RFID allows money to carry its own history by
recording information about where it has been.

http://www.eetimes.com/story/OEG20011219S0016

==============================

Kevin Ashton, executive director of the Auto-ID Center, concedes
there's a Brave New World feel to it all, but adds, "The dollar value
of this opportunity, well ... there's so many zeros on the end of it
that it's hard to make people believe you."

http://www.mindfully.org/Food/The-Code.htm
(originally at: http://techupdate.zdnet.com/techupdate/stories/main/0,14179,2660904-9,00.html  but the link has expired)

==============================

Ashton acknowledges that consumers and businesses alike might be very
uncomfortable with a system in which the police could find out
detailed information about everything in a car's trunk without opening
it.

http://www.business2.com/articles/web/0,,15024,FF.html

==============================

One of the greatest challenges facing the creators of such an
infrastructure will be finding ways to allow consumers to opt in or
out of the system as it becomes more pervasive. "It's not clear how
that's going to happen," [says Sanjay E. Sarma, an MIT professor and
co-director of the Auto-ID Center] "But it's important if companies
want to prevent a public backlash against these systems."

"Any one piece of information" -- cell phone records, purchasing
records, car location -- "is not that damning or intrusive. But if you
put them together, you've got my life," [security researcher David]
Holtzman said. "It's very hard to hide things when you have that level
of analysis."  Even if these uses aren't what retailers and
manufacturers have in mind, technology has a way of creeping into
other domains, Holtzman added. Transponders for driving through
electronic tollbooths started as a convenience to drivers but now are
used in combination with timing analysis to send out speeding tickets,
for example.

In 1974 (I remember the year cuz it was the year "Space: 1999" went on
the air - as a 7 year old kid, I *LOVED* that show.  I watch it now
and it SUCKS, what was I thinking?), we moved from Calgary, Alberta to
Bateman, Saskatchewan, a very small town in southern Saskatchewan,
population about 40.  It was large enough to have its own "central
office" (just a little shed) and its own central office code, 306-269.
About three months after moving there, SaskTel made a major service
upgrade: we now had DDD.  Previously, we had to dial "0" and ask the
operator to complete our long-distance calls (and most calls from
Bateman were to nearby Gravelbourg, some 18 miles away and a toll
call, so we were dialing "0" most of the time).  

After DDD was introduced, we could dial "112", followed, if I'm not
mistaken, either a 7-digit or 10-digit number.  The former if within
306 (which covers all of Saskatchewan), the latter if elsewhere in the
NANPA.  I remember figuring out that I could get the long-distance
trunk by picking up the phone, toggling the switch once, then waiting,
then toggling it again, then waiting, then toggling it twice quickly.
You'd hear this satisfying "clunk" sound from the receiver to indicate
you were now about to call a long-distance number.  You even got that
then-characteristic "long distance whistle" on the line, even before
you'd dialed the number.

Presumably this was a step-by-step arrangement.  The 306-269 part of
the local number was not significant and was "absorbed" by the
switching equipment.  The final four digits were significant, and if I
recall correctly, the 3xxx numbers were assigned "in town" and 4xxx
numbers were assigned to surround farms.  You needed only dial the
4-digit subscriber line number to reach anybody locally.

We moved away from Saskatchewan a couple of years later, but I
returned there in 1997 for the 75th anniversary (and, alas, closing)
of the Bateman School.  By now, the population of Bateman was a
whopping 8.  The post office had closed, the local garage had closed,
the grain elevators had closed, and now the school was closing.  The
telephone shed was still there, but at some time in the intervening
20+ years, Bateman's 306-269 prefix code had been dropped, and
everybody using it (including all the local farmers for miles around)
had been switched over to 306-648 Gravelbourg, which at least had the
benefit of making Gravelbourg a local call.  And, DDD was now
accomplished with "1", not "112" (followed by a mandatory 10 digits).

If I try to dial any 1-306-269 number from Calgary now, I get an
immediate fast-busy.  Finally, all 7 digits of the number have to be
dialed.  If you dialed any three digits and they didn't begin with
"1", "0", or "648", you got a fast-busy.

Any idea why they'd do this?  Amalgamate everyone from 269 into 648,
then never reassign 269?  It's not like Saskatchewan is facing a
numbering shortage -- hell, that province loses population every year
and they're a long way from facing a split or overlay.  I can see why
people in the area would want the phone company to make Gravelbourg a
local call -- Gravelbourg is sorta the "business hub" of the area and
it's where everybody goes for shopping, etc., but why phase out 269
at all?  It's a pain in the ass for everybody and there's no real
benefit I can see (other than reclaiming a CO code which they didn't
really need to do).

BTW, we Albertans tell people that the "official" slogan of
Saskatchewan is "Would the last person out of Saskatchewan please turn
out the lights?"  :-) (A fair percentage of the people in this city
are from Saskatchewan or have at least lived there)

Here in Calgary, up until the early 1980's, you could dial local
numbers by dialing only the last SIX digits.  Our telco, then known
as "A.G.T." (Alberta Government Telephones), had done some planning:
all telephone numbers (up until then, at least) began with the digit
"2", therefore "2" could be omitted when dialing a local call.  This
disappeared sometime around 1982 or 1983, and then around 1987ish
they ran out of numbers beginning with "2" (mainly because they had
not yet adopted the use of NXX prefixes - they were limited to NNX
prefixes.  They had every code from 220 through 299 with the
exception of 222, 223, 224, and 227, which had been previously
assigned to towns north of Calgary along the highway 2.  A fifth
prefix, 226, had also been assigned to the town of Olds, but then
reclaimed -- Olds was re-assigned "556" and every customer in the town
screamed about it.  

After that experience, AGT decided not to reclaim any more codes, and
left 222, 223, 224, and 227 where they were).  I was one of the first
people to get one of these new "not-2" numbers, which IIRC was
569-0750.  Man oh man, it was a *BITCH* to get a pizza or a taxi.
NOBODY would believe me when I told them what my phone number was!
One company, Mother's Pizza, flat out COULD NOT send me a pizza.  The
reason: they were on a computerized dispatching system which they'd
had custom-made for them.  It *INSISTED* on the leading digit "2" and
wouldn't accept a "5", and thus wouldn't accept my order.  They later
fixed this, and shortly after that went bankrupt.  :-) Today we now
have three or four times as many prefixes as we did in 1987, with
local numbers now starting with every allowable digit (2 through 9).
I still get a few odd looks when I tell people my number (which starts
with 313), as it's a Sprint Canada prefix and is therefore quite
unusual.

Things got a little confusing for long-time Calgarians last year,
when Telus (and other telcos) began assigning numbers that began with
the digit "4" within the city of Calgary.  The city of Edmonton,
about three hours north of here and the capital city of Alberta, had
had a similar arrangement to Calgary's pre-80's: all local numbers
had, for many years, begun with the digit "4".  In 1999, the 403
(Alberta) area code was split, with Calgary retaining 403 and
Edmonton moving to 780, so all of those "Edmonton numbers" were now
available for re-use in Calgary.  To their credit, Telus waited a
good long time to let everyone get used to 780 before reassigning
403-4XX numbers in Calgary.  Still, I know a few people who have
these new numbers and they report that they do get wrong number calls
from people trying to call Edmonton, and that they sometimes face
disbelief when telling other Calgarians what their number is.  :-)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Wichita, Kansas took over the entire
316 area code a year or so ago; the rest of us -- all of southeastern
and southwestern Kansas got moved into 620 which should last for a
good long time. Here in our town, most people still give only the last
four digits when referring to their phone number. The exchange 331 is
presumed in speaking, although in dialing, all seven digits are required. 
Most people here do not know we actually have 330, 331, and 332
although 330 only applies to Montgomery County Sheriff and other
county government (what there is of it) and cellular phones from 
Cingular Wireless/Cellular One/Alltel. 332 only applies to the phones
at City Hall, local police, schools, city government, etc. Everyone 
else (i.e. all residents and business places) in town is 331. I am
told some Cellular One phones are also on 332. SWB Telco says a 'few'
numbers in 332 are reserved for 'when they have to use them' for wire
line residences and businesses. No estimate when that will be. 

Our sister city, Coffeyville has been 251 since the 1950's when dial
service started. Now I note that my cousin who lives in c-ville has a
252 number; that's mostly used in an expansion part of town out by
the golf course. And apparently cell phones in c-ville are also 252.
They were also in the habit of speaking in four digits, presuming the 
251 part, although dialing all seven.  Lately they still say four
digits, but if the person is 252 they will correct the speaker.  PAT]

You're not paying for a business listing -- you're paying for a
telephone line for business use.  It's been customary for a very long
time to charge businesses more than residential customers, in order to
make residential service more affordable.

I don't think the IRS will allow a business deduction for a
residential line, and ISTR reading somewhere that you can't even
deduct a business line if it's the only line coming into a residence.

For many artists not signed up to major record companies you can
bypass the companies entirely and purchase directly from the artist's
web sites or from independent distributors.

Not a big market yet, but hopefully it will grow and weaken the
fanatical grip the "majors" have on recorded music all over the
western world.

I agree.  And more to the point, as Mariah Carey and others have
pointed out, the actual artists see little or nothing from album
purchases anyway -- the labels take pretty much everything.  Thus the
moral high ground that the record companies claim to be arguing from
is phony from the get-go.  (And quite a few new artists have taken to
distributing their own material on the net rather than sell their
souls to the record companies.  Maybe the real purpose of RIAA's
campaign against music-sharing sites is to make it impossible for
artists to compete against them in this way.)

Date: Mon, 2 Dec 2002 17:53:16 -0500


By KEN BELSON

TOKYO, Dec.  1 - On the face of it, Keiji Tachikawa should have been
crowing.

As competitors around the globe struggle to survive, Mr.  Tachikawa,
the president of NTT DoCoMo, was telling reporters how his company
earned a profit in the six months through September.  Sales were up,
and DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone carrier and second-largest
company over all, said it expected to earn $1.5 billion for the full
year.

But Mr.  Tachikawa's presentation on Nov.  7 was noticeably on edge,
and for good reason.  Three years after its i-mode Internet-enabled
phones took the telecommunications industry by storm, DoCoMo is
looking more and more like an ordinary company.  Profit fell 95
percent from the comparable six months last year, and revenue grew
just 1.9 percent - hardly the expected pace for a company that
formerly could not supply phones fast enough to its clamorous
customers.

Mr.  Tachikawa, who guided DoCoMo through its boom years but is now
navigating rough waters, also reduced full-year forecasts.

The causes are simple, yet overwhelming.  More than 62 percent of
Japanese have cellular phones, so finding new subscribers has turned
into a costly battle with DoCoMo's rivals, KDDI and J-Phone.  In a
weak economy, consumers are increasingly reluctant to pay $400 for
DoCoMo's fancy third-generation phones or spend $100 a month
downloading bulky audio files.  To compete, DoCoMo must cut prices, a
humbling concession for a company whose products had always commanded
a premium.

Subject: GAO Pushes Digital TV Deadline/Regulators Should Drop Analog
Date: Mon, 2 Dec 2002 18:11:04 -0500


By Peter J. Howe, Globe Staff, 12/2/2002

With the US television industry making only sluggish progress in
converting to digital formats including high-definition TV, a General
Accounting Office study being released today suggests that federal
regulators should mandate a deadline for cable operators to begin
carrying digital channels instead of over-the-air analog channels.

The study, commissioned by US Representative Edward J. Markey of
Malden, the ranking Democrat on the House telecommunications
subcommittee, also urges the Federal Communications Commission to
consider a deadline for requiring television set makers to include
components enabling cable and satellite TV subscribers to get digital
channels directly.

Five years ago, Congress directed the FCC to set a 2006 deadline for
the nation's television broadcasters to shift from analog signals to
digital formats that can deliver sharper pictures and CD-quality
sound.  The move would also free up thousands of analog TV frequencies
for reuse by wireless telecommunications providers and public safety
agencies.

However, most officials doubt the 2006 deadline will be met because
stations would not be required to shut off their analog signals until
85 percent of viewers in their markets own digital-ready television
sets.  Fewer than 1 percent of the 28 million sets sold in the United
States last year included a digital TV tuner, according to the
Consumer Electronics Association.

In August, the FCC ordered that, by July 2007, all new TVs sold in the
United States that have 13-inch or larger screens must have a digital
tuner.  The electronics association, however, has argued that this
mandate could add $250 or more to the price of TV sets, although other
industry groups say that added cost could eventually drop to under $20
as mass-production efficiencies develop.

But the new study by the GAO, an arm of Congress, says a major
unresolved issue is how to make digital signals more available for the
roughly 80 percent of US homes that get TV from cable or satellite.

Instead of requiring cable and satellite subscribers to use an
over-the-air tuner to get digital signals, the GAO study said the FCC
should consider requiring sales of TV sets that can get a digital
signal directly from a cable line without requiring a set-top box,
similar to today's cable-ready analog sets.

Yes, several times Thursday and Friday, and they too did not work.
HOWEVER, trying again this morning (using a BOOKMARKED URL that did

This isn't the case in Canada, at least as far as the CIBC (Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce) and TD Bank (Toronto Dominion) are
concerned.  All the banks co-own something called "Interac", which is
a direct-payment system.  It also allows people to withdraw money from
another bank's machine (with an appropriate "Interac fee" added).  If
I buy something from a merchant with my Interac card (the same card
used for all ATM banking), I must key in my PIN on a keypad.  Once I
successfully key in the PIN, and ok the transaction, the money is
IMMEDIATELY debited from my account and credited to the merchant's
account.  There's no delay, the money goes POOF across the wires.  I
have personally made such a payment and been back at my computer
within 5 minutes to check my online banking account, and seen the
transaction there on my screen.  Now, it's possible that this is just
a hold, but it's an irreversible hold - I no longer have access to the
money, and this whole thing is risk-free to the merchant (but they get
hosed on fees -- that's another story).

Some wag once claimed that the British celebrate Thanksgiving on the
Fourth of July.  :-)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The Pilgrims, also known as the
Puritans, did have Thanksgiving that day, midst their squabbles on
various topics. Many felt they should not be idle like that and
it would be better to have it when their work was finished, i.e. the
harvest had been gathered, later in the fall, and they had one then
also (in the fall) since they all enjoyed having good dinners. Their
principal spat divided them in two camps: they were all on the outs
with the Church of England of course, but the 'conforming Puritans'
felt that change was best accomplished through the existing structure
of the church, with its system of Bishops, etc. The 'non-conforming
Puritans' felt it best to make each church (congregation) responsible
for its own affairs, thus came the establishment of the Congregational
Church in the USA. That did not stop them all from going to each
other's dinners however, which they did all the time. 

Regards wags and British Thanksgiving and Fourth of July, I guess you
know what certain Indian tribes in the USA call 'Thanksgiving Day'.
They refer to it, quite appropriatly, as 'The Day of Mourning', along
with Christopher Columbus as a devil. I mean, if visitors came to your
home (land), you shared your dinner and possessions with them to be
their friends, and they repaid you by killing your relatives and those
of you that were allowed to live had all your land stolen and you were
moved onto tiny, filthy substandard 'reservations' would you like that
turn of events?  'Columbus Day' in the USA should rightly be termed
the day that Europeans created a new level of arrogance when they
landed on these shores. 

And its not like Thanksgiving Day even means everyone in America is
'thankful'. I do volunteer work for Salvation Army of Independence/
Montgomery County, and we *attempted* to see to it that everyone got a
good dinner last Thursday, in cooperation with the Food Basket, one
of our local charities. My kettle is located outside Marvin's Grocery
Store on 10th and Myrtle Streets. I was standing there with my bell
on Friday night. A woman came by and said "I gave money on Wednesday".
I said to her "I am still standing here tonight, I guess you did not
give enough." She gave me a sort of funny look, got in her purse and
found a couple more dimes to put in the pot. I thanked her for her
generosity, and she walked inside the store.   PAT]

Subject: Public Interest Registry Contract to Manage .org Finalized

PUBLIC INTEREST REGISTRY CONTRACT TO MANAGE .ORG FINALIZED
PIR promises open, responsible and global stewardship of domain, new
services/benefits for noncommercial organizations.

Reston, VA - December 3, 2002 - The Public Interest Registry (PIR)
today announced the execution of its contract with the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) to operate the .ORG
top-level domain.  PIR will assume responsibility from the current
registry operator, VeriSign, on January 1, 2003.

We are pleased to be moving forward in our efforts to serve the
worldwide .ORG community, said ISOC President/CEO Lynn St.Amour.  PIR
shares ISOC's vision of setting a new standard for registry services
that will meet the unique interests of non-commercial organizations
on the Internet.

PIR board chairman David Maher explained that PIR will reinforce and
build on .ORG's heritage as the home of non-commercial entities on the
Internet through global educational outreach and enhanced services.
PIR's goal is to provide open, responsible and global stewardship of
.ORG. This will be done through educational support, feedback
mechanisms, superior technology, new services for noncommercial
registrants, and international outreach.

The PIR board is composed of technologically savvy experts in a
variety of areas from around the globe who share the vision for
setting a new standard for registry services.  They will guide the
organization in the remainder of its staffing and administrative tasks
through the transition and the first year of start-up.  Board members
include Gerry Baranano, Frode Greisen, Lawrence H. Landweber, Alan
Levin, Andy Linton, David W. Maher and Marc Rotenberg.  David Maher is
the chairman, Andy Linton is the secretary and Alan Levin is the
treasurer.  Lynn St. Amour, ISOC President/CEO is an ex-officio
non-voting representative to the PIR board.

PIR will assume the role of registry operator for .ORG on January 1,
2003.  In order to minimize disruption and make the transition as
smooth as possible, all parties have agreed to a 25-day phase-in
period during which back-end services will continue to be provided by
VeriSign.  This phase-in period was requested by VeriSign and will
have no adverse financial impact on PIR.  It will also allow
registrars more time for testing and thus enhance the stability of the
system.  On January 25, 2003, the back-end technical services for the
registry will be cutover from VeriSign to Afilias.

PIR has a dedicated Web site - www.publicinterestregistry.org - to
provide detailed information on the transition to the public.  Special
processes have been developed to ensure a smooth transition for domain
name retailers (registrars); registrants should see only minimal
differences.

An extensive bid solicitation and evaluation process for the
management of .ORG began in May of 2002. ISOC submitted its proposal
on June 18, 2002. The ICANN Board voted to approve ISOC's proposal on
October 14, 2002 and subsequently entered into contract
negotiations. PIR was established by the Internet Society (ISOC) in
October 2002 and has subcontracted with Dublin-based Afilias Limited
for operational support.

ABOUT PIR

Public Interest Registry (PIR) is a not-for-profit corporation created to
manage the .ORG registry.  PIR's mission is to manage the .ORG domain in a

education and communications infrastructure, and educates and empowers the
noncommercial community to most effectively utilize the Internet.

PIR was created by the Internet Society (ISOC).  ISOC is a
not-for-profit, open membership organization founded in 1991 and is
dedicated to ensuring the open evolution, development and use of the

Chapter one is an outline of the book.  The differences between
symmetric and asymmetric cryptography are given in chapter two, which
provides a good treatment of the basics, although there are odd
additions of extraneous details.  The XML primer, in chapter three,
follows the all-too-common practice of describing syntax rather than
function, but the explanation of document parts is useful.  The syntax
of XML digital signatures, and a brief mention of canonicalization,
makes up chapter four.  Part two of the introduction to signatures is
in chapter five, which concentrates on canonicalization, but does not
present this important concept clearly.  Chapter six provides some
examples, although neither the problems nor the solutions are defined
well.  The elements of XML encryption are listed in chapter seven.
Chapter eight is a promotion for an RSA product.  The elements of the
XML key management specifications are given in chapter nine.

While the syntax of various XML operations is provided properly, the
book fails to provide the newcomer to the field with any understanding
of the uses or limitations of the XML security provisions.

It's hard to imagine that the phone company will object to another
phone line for your residence.  After all, you're online a lot, and
don't want to miss calls.

IANAL, but would suggest that if you're writing checks (on your
business account) to cover it, it is unlikely that it will ever be
questioned, regardless of whose name it is in.  And if it is, the tax
people will probably accept your explanation if it's obvious that you
do indeed have a business (you're filing business or self-employment
taxes).

Yes, see http://www.psion.com/computers/ but note that they will be
discontinued sometime soon. There is a speaker on the back that tone
dials any number from the address book. It's quite sophisticated in
that if you tell it where you are it will add the proper dialling
codes as well as a configurable prefix for an "outside line". It also
knows about time zones, summer time, sunrise and sunset etc. You can
synchronise it with Outlook. I have one of the earlier models (a 3c).

You, sir, know not that of which you speak.  As far as _today's_ world
goes.

The Fed Reserve 'clearing' system is no longer a 'one run a night' batch

I don't submit _any_ paper, or mag tape to my credit-card clearinghouse.
It is 100% 'on-line' real-time transaction processing.

I have processed a debit card transaction at 8PM local time, and the
corresponding funds were *IN* _my_ merchant deposit account at 9AM the
*next* day.

Credit-card charges are available to me, i.e. in my deposit account, as of
the beginning of the 3rd day after the transaction.

'Paperless' EFT transactions now get handled a _lot_ faster than even
a few years ago.

More-or-less correct, *EXCEPT* that the actual phase of the the satellite 
orbiting the Earth has _NOTHING_ to do with it.

And the range of dates is March 22 through April 25.  Not April 15.

There is the 'astronomical' full moon, and the 'liturgical' one.  Easter is
based on the date of the 'liturgical' full moon.

The issue, and solutions thereunto,  _predates_ Pope Gregory by more than
a _thousand_ years.

"Way back when", somebody in the Church did a set of calculation of
when the Full Moon 'should' occur.  Those calculations remain the
*official* means of determining when any/all of the "movable feasts",
of which Easter is the best known, occur.  The 'gotcha' is that those
calculations _do_not_ precisely match the real world.

The gory details of the mechanics:

   1) take what _century_ it is, i.e., year/100, 
   2) 'reduce' that number, modulo a constant (19)
   3) use -that- number to select one of 7 look-up tables,
   4) use the low two digits of the year to index into that selected look-up
      table.
   5) the date listed is 'Easter' for that year.

This is a modified form -- established by Vitorius of Aquitania in 457
A.D. at the request of the then Pope -- of the methodology first
established by the Observatory at Alexandria, in accord with the
declarations of the Council of Nicea, in 325 A.D.  Which was called,
among other reasons, to 'reconcile' several *different* and
incompatable methodologies used by various factions of the Church.

The tables were modified in 1582, when Pope Gregory XIII 'corrected'
the Julian Calendar.  "Everything" was moved by 10 days, to bring the
Equinox back to March 21.  *BUT* it was determined that Easter was 3
days off, and thus the correction for Easter was only _7_ days.

I just call my own cell phone when I want to find that out. It has caller

That's interesting. Since cell phone users derive this alleged
economic benefit from using their phones while driving, would they be
willing to bear the economic burden of increased accidents on the road
allegedly caused by those phones?

Would cell phone users be willing to pay a $500 fee if they were using
their cell phone at the time of an accident? How about a flat fee for
each activated cell phone in the US? How about a a per-minute usage
charge? Or maybe charging users whenever their connection is handed
off to a new cell -- when they're moving?

No matter what system would be chosen. I'm certain the cellular
community would balk at any such charges.

If you look at the original post it says "input +cc/area code/number"
and that is literally what I enter and it will work to any area and
from any area.  I can dial +12063549999, 12063549999, 2063549999 or
3549999 and all will work.  + followed by country code/area
code/number will *always* work or at least it always will with GSM.  I
can *always* dial the same sequence everywhere if I know the country
code and area code used.  It makes for easy uniform dialing with less
possible errors in dialing and not having to learn what the local
dialing procedures and patterns are as the default +cc/ac/number will
always work.  Another standardization that is made with GSM.

Unrelated, but it's also interesting that I can be roaming far from my
home area and if I dial 7 digits I will connect to any number in my
local 7 digit calling area.


Replies are seldom read.  Please reply in the group

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: My Nokia 5165 phone does the same
thing; dial only seven digits and the phone defaults to ten full
digits. That's only the software in the phone doing that. Whatever
is considered your 'home' area code is what the Nokia will plug in 
for the first three digits if it only recieves seven digits in 
dialing.   PAT]

Not so. + tells the phone to send the number flagged as international
format, not to substitute IDD prefix for the +. Otherwise world
travellers would not be able to use their phone's stored numbers in
NANP. For example in Europe 00 CC will not connect on a POTS line if

That final sentence is, alas, incorrect - even though it shouldn't be.
Under current fair use doctrine, it is legal for you to make a copy,
for your own personal use and not to give away or sell or otherwise
distribute, of YOUR OWN legally-purchased CD.  It is *NOT* legal for
you to download somebody else's MP3 of a song EVEN IF you do own a
legally-purchased copy of the disc it came on.  It's a fine distinction 
but there's no question that it exists.

I'm just playin' devil's advocate.  I agree completely with John
Higdon's views on the RIAA - if they'd give the public what it WANTS,
they'd make money hand over fist.  Bottled-water companies make a mint
selling a product that's freely available just about anywhere.
Telling me that I can't download an MP3 version of a song I've already
paid for is just plain ludicrous - nevertheless, they do have that
right.  What they CAN do and what they SHOULD do (with that right) are
two different things.

Would you please stop spamming your own newsgroup!


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: That's the first time I have ever
received a message quite like that. The message was signed; the
person did not say to make it anonymous, but as I think about it
now, maybe it is the consensus of many of you, so think that one
of YOUR friends wrote it. In a make-believe world, I wish it was
not necessary to 'spam my own newsgroup'. In the same make-believe
world it would not be required for PBS Radio/TV to give commercials
about themselves. I do not loan out my now considerable mailing list
or allow people to copy from it. (Should I start?) I do not accept
other than *very low key* advertising on the web site (no banner ads,
no double-click pop up windows; no diagnosing what causes your
personal pleasure to happen and focusing advertising messages at you
accordingly. (Should I start?) No wholesale spamming in any newsgroup
or e-journal under my control. (Should I start?) At the same time, I
like to eat dinner at night, and have a warm house to live in. There
is not enough time in a day, nor energy, to put out this Digest and
maintain the web site AND work 8-10 hours per day at a 'regular'
job. (Should I quit the Digest and work instead?) All the above are
characteristics of this make-believe world. 

I thought (still think) a reasonable compromise is to take one or two
days per month and run a single message in each of them discussing
these things. The last day of the month and/or the first day of the
next month is a good, reliable, steady time to do this. You get
several hundred messages in a month's time -- about 50-60 issues of
the Digest -- with all of about three or four 'reminder' messages. I
do admit to writing one message each month, and using it on the three
or four times cut and paste (on that last day/first day formula) on a
repeating basis. If that is 'spamming my own newsgroup', then I must
apologize. If you are still reading this Digest, then I assume you
like to read it. I do not have it exclusively on a web page and then
proceed to lock up your browser so you cannot leave without going
through several screens of spam and advertising. But here in Real
World, where I live, it is necessary to survive the best you can while
attempting to be of service in the community as best you can. I would
like to entertain a discussion here if anyone wants to have one. I am
not saying I will do anything other than view the entire thing with
some displeasure and lots of disdain, but I will view it and take
suggestions. Bear in mind since my deseased brain took over my life
now more than two years ago, I have not had any 'regular' full time
employment; I get a small pittance from Uncle Sugar in the Social
Security Disability Program (Title 2 money) to live on. Now the floor

Crescent Teams With IBM To Provide Secure Electronic
Messenger Service To Health Care Industry

Houston, TX/EWORLDWIRE/December 3, 2002 --- Crescent Communications
Inc. (OTCBB:CCES), a leading application service provider (ASP),
announced today that its BLUEGATE(TM) health care division has
partnered with IBM (NYSE:IBM) to integrate IBM Sametime and
BLUEGATE, the Crescent information technology solution for the health
care industry. The offering will be called BLUEGATE Consult(TM),
declares Crescent Chief Executive Officer Manfred Sternberg.

Sametime - a proprietary and secure instant messaging, conferencing
and meeting solution - is the most widely used product of its kind in
the corporate world. BLUEGATE Consult provides stable and improved
security features, allowing medical providers to communicate sensitive
patient information electronically, instantly.

BLUEGATE Consult is part of the more complete BLUEGATE solution that
enables physicians to become more efficient by using sound, secure
technology while meeting emerging requirements from the Health
Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

HIPAA, passed by U.S. Congress, mandates that the entire U.S. health
care industry process all health care information, including billing
and record storage, through a secure data interchange beginning on
April 14, 2003.

BLUEGATE provides a cost-effective, efficient way for hospitals, large
clinics, regional laboratories and health plans to transmit
confidential patient records, documents and other information across
the Internet to physicians and patients.

"Think about it: Why shouldn't the health care industry enjoy
information technology at the level corporate America has for the last
decade?" Sternberg asks. "Many large corporations have constructed
complex networks to bring people together from different geographic
locations, with important ideas and critical business information."

"We're happy to see Crescent include a real-time collaboration product
into its BLUEGATE health care solution," says David Pumpa, manager of
IBM Worldwide Technology Partner Sales. "With IBM Sametime, doors will
be opened to instantaneous, live communication. Between doctors,
nurses and pharmacists, communications can be streamlined and improved
dramatically with this tool."

International Data Corp. (IDC), a Framingham, Mass., market-research
firm, says that by the end of last year, 20 million people were using
instant messaging in business.  IDC predicts that figure will rise to
300 million by the end of 2005.

"IM products are used by medical professionals in hospitals, clinics
and trauma centers where real-time information flow can be critical,"
Robert Mahowald of IDC says. "In order to comply with HIPPA
requirements, hospitals will look for secure messaging products in the
near-term."

With BLUEGATE Consult, physicians have another medium to consult
efficiently with their colleagues.

IBM Corp. is the world's largest information technology company, with
80 years of leadership in helping businesses innovate. IBM Software
offers a wide range of middleware and operating systems for all types
of computing platforms, allowing customers to take full advantage of
the new era of e-business.

Based in Houston, Crescent Communications provides a value added
network (VAN) focused on small-business and enterprise-level market
segments. Crescent builds industry-specific, end-to-end solutions for
such vertical markets as medical, high-end graphics and printing,
legal and financial. Using several regional and national carriers,
Crescent offers wireless, digital subscriber line (DSL) and
traditional communication technologies. Crescent delivers virtual
private networks (VPNs), application and Web hosting services, as well
as managed firewall services from its ATM core fiber backbone
network. For more information, visit http://www.crescentb.com.

No, that's the cell carrier's switch interpreting 7D numbers as being
in your own area code, just like POTS switches do.  I also have a 5165
with service from Cingular, and although 7D calls work fine when I'm
on my home system, they don't work when roaming.  The phone just sends
the digits you dial or that are retrieve from the phone book.

GSM phones have a plus button that let you do consistent worldwide
dialing, but North American AMPS, TDMA, and CDMA phones don't.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Begging pardon ... when I got my
*first* Nokia 5165 I was staying in Chicago, IL during the absolutely
horrid winter of 2000-01. Mike Sandman got it turned on for me, in 
his suburban town located in area *630* for Roselle, IL. I programmed
it with the seven digit number for Mike's office, 980-xxxx. When I 
moved here to Independence in December, 2001, I brought the phone
along and used it frequently on the Greyhound/Jefferson Lines busses
to get here. It got Mike okay *as speed dialed from the memory of the
phone* (seven digits). When I got here, it continued to work *as
programmed in memory with seven digits* even though AT&T has no
specific service in Independence. (It always would roam off of Dobson
Cell Towers in Liberty, Kansas; a 'Cellular One' operation). Mike
found out that AT&T *absolutely hates* to give away anything, so they
locked me on their tower as long as possible out of Tulsa (and once
I got here in Indy) as long as they could. It was only when the signal
got to be so awful and they could not hold it any longer they would
pass it off to the nearest Cellular One outfit. 

This is quite beside the point, but once I switched to Cingular, the
signal shot through the roof, literally, sitting in the same chair on
my same back porch. Cingular had a large pile of cellular phones in
their storefront window on Penn Street downtown here, so when I went
in to see about getting my Nokia 5165 converted over to them (saving
the expense of a new contract, etc) the lady took one look at it,
clucked her tongue and said, "AT&T has their phones locked up with
firmware inside. We cannot convert them to Cingular." Still having
some memories of Chicago, IL  in my mind, I thought maybe she was
umm, lying to me. But a stop at Dobson's Cell One  around the corner
brought me the same answer. They also deal with Nokia 5165 by the
truckful. Radio Shack up the street (he brokers Alltel but will turn
on any phone he can and put them on Alltel) had the same answer. 
George, the company man from Alltel in the kiosk at Walmart
Supercenter told me the same thing, with some choice words about AT&T
and how they lock their cellular customers in and 'fix' the phone so
no one else can 'use' it later. United States Cellular's agent downtown
said the same thing:  In all respects, it is Nokia 5165, but do not
try to use it anywhere but AT&T. If you get rid of AT&T because you
do not like them for some reason, you may as well throw the phone
away. Just get used to having AT&T try to handle your call from a 
tower in Tulsa whenever possible, or get a half-baked signal using
Dobson Cell One. That's how AT&T does it.  

Again, I am digressing ... all during the above paragraph as I
stuggled with my AT&T service here in Independence, I *was* able to
speed dial Mike's seven digit number, because the phone *thought* it
was a 630 area phone. I finally got a new Cingular Wireless account
with a new Nokia 5165. Seated side by side, I would see two identical
phones, one with the 'extended area' screen from AT&T and the signal
strengh barely moving. The Cingular phone on the other hand was always
lively on its signal. I am certain they had to be going from the same
tower, southeast of town in Liberty, Kansas, on Dobson Cell Towers.
Mike had my AT&T account stopped (he called me one day and said would
I please turn the old Nokia off for a minute; they want to kill it 
and can't as long as it is turned on). I turned it off, then back on
to reregister the signal, and there wasn't any service on it any
longer. Since I do not have reason to use AT&T that often any longer,
and not willing to toss away a perfectly good phone, I had it put on
AT&T 'Free to Go' prepaid service with a Wichita, Kansas 316 number
for the calls now and then I do not want to have related to my own
personal phone lines. No John, I am certain the Nokia 5165 allows
seven digit dialing to what it considers its 'home area code'. You
see when I first got here in Independence I kept the 630 number Mike
had put on it to start with. It continued to do seven digit dialing
to Mike's office all that time. 

I guess I mentioned how Cingular Wireless had all their local
Independence customers on 620-870, a 'wide area toll free local
calling' exchange at first. Then quite innocently they decided to
kill the deal they had with Southwestern Bell for that exchange but
only tell the customers who specifically asked about it. They moved
me over to 620-330 (local Independence cellular service) last week
but left it up to me to get SWB to reroute my call forwarding on busy/
no answer to the new number which *finally* took place just today.

A quick google search yields many hits:
http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/biz/tax/20011022a.asp

The IRS assumes that you will have a phone in your house anyway, so
Zobel cautions that regular fees and charges don't count towards your
deduction. But if you have a second line installed and use it only for
business, 100 percent of these costs are deductible.

http://www.chicagotribune.com/classified/realestate/chi-0202010344feb01,0,993350.story

100 percent of some home-business expenses are deductible. For
example, you can deduct all of your home-business telephone expenses.

I have never seen any indication that the IRS cares how the phone is
listed with the telco, so long as you can reasonably show that it is
used for your business and not for personal use.

Finnish Taxi Drivers To Pay Royalties For Backseat Music

Finland's Supreme Court has ruled taxi drivers must pay royalty fees
if they play music in their car while a customer is in the backseat.

The order even applies to the radio.

This is exactly what scares the RIAA the most, and is the reason the 
organization is desperately trying to eliminate or cripple digital 
technology. It isn't copying that worries the record companies; it is 
the ultimate bypass that the web offers to budding artists ... who won't 
have to turn over the bulk of their earnings to the cigar-smoking gents 
in the plush offices anymore.

If the RIAA revealed the true motivation behind its attack on
web-distributed digital technology, the public would tell them where
to put it ... and they know it. So instead, they harp on "copyright
infringement" as the cause celebre, which, as we have seen in this
very forum, comes off to many as a righteous quest.

But time may be running out. More and more people are waking up to the 
real intent behind this War on Customers. Many artists are as well.

No less august figure than Billy Joel, on international television,
suggested to his audience that they obtain one of his early albums (or
at least copies of the songs thereon) "for free, if possible" since he
would never see another dime from the album. You could have knocked me
over with a feather when he said that; it was a very powerful
statement.

Subject: What *is* a "Domain Name"?
Date: Tue, 03 Dec 2002 15:39:41 -0800


Subject line gives the basic question: What is a "domain name"? -- as
a practical matter and also legally and for intellectual property
purposes?

For example:

Is a domain name a domain name only if it's registered?  Are all
domain names registered?  If it's not registered, is it not a domain
name?  Can intranets have "effective internal domain names" that are
not "real Internet-wide domain names"?

Must you register a domain name to get it into domain name servers all 
around the internet?

Are a domain name and a URL equivalent?

In some URL like

    http://www.xxx.yyy.org/more.stuff/still.more.stuff"

where "www.xxx.yyy.org " has been properly registered, is the domain 
name only the part up to the "org"?  -- or more generally, does the 
domain name extend only up to the first single slash in any URL?  

Is any remaining stuff within successive slashes more properly referred 
to as a "page", within a "web site" or "domain"?

Do all domain names start with "www"?  

Do they all have to end with a final ".xxx" that comes from a certain 
fixed list of terms, e.g. ".org", ".com", or "dot some country code"?

My university (www.stanford.edu) seems to set up a lot of sites -- or 
pages? -- that have a syntax like "xxxx.stanford.edu", e.g. 
"bookstore.stanford.edu", "library.stanford.edu", etc.  Do these have to 
be individually registered?  Or can anyone who has a domain 
"www.yyy.zzz" automatically add things like "newstuff.yyy.zzz"?  (Or is 
this maybe something Stanford is doing within its internal domain, and 
it's not visible to the outside world?)

How far into this whole mess do intellectual property rights -- 
trademarks, copyrights -- extend?  Do trademark and copyright concerns 
extend with equal force to an entire URL?  Or only the domain name part 
of a URL?

And I suppose what I might have asked first of all: Are there some good 
URLs -- or domains! -- where one can get understandable info on queries 
like these?

Please correct me if I am wrong, but I thought the one main purpose of
the Council of Nicea (which brought together the bishops of the
church) under Pope Saint Sylvester in 325 AD was to test the
canonicity of the scriptures, in the format they were known at the
time, and to ultimatly close the Canon against further rewrites,
etc. I know there was much discussion about what was to be considered
apocryphal in nature, and what was to be considered "God's Word". (What
we are talking about is 'when was the Bible considered written?') I
thought that was the purpose of Nicea, to establish that the Bible was
'written' in its present structure, and the Canon closed against any
further rewrites in 325 AD, when the finished work had been debated
sufficiently and handed over to Pope Saint Sylvester. I did not know
the council had all that other administrivia in the process. PAT]

Two reasons:

The cell phone doesn't work in that location.
Lines that don't present CID for various reasons, always present ANI.
Maybe not the ANI you want, but an ANI.

I didn't mean you were being "cheap".  There's a reason why all of
those readback numbers keep getting shut off.  Even if that 800 number
terminates on your switch via direct access, it still costs some
not-inconsequential amount per call, especially if you don't have
payphones blocked.

I miss the ANI-800 that I used to have, and I only "shared" that number
with one person from this group.

I expect it would.  Another "phone" that does is the Handspring
VisorPhone, and I suspect the Treo communicators do as well.  My old
Mitsubishi G75 had a feature to prepend your preferred area code, but
you have to turn it off manually to dial neither outside your NPA or a
vertical service code such as 611 (502611 doesn't work worth squat :-).

I wasn't clear -- home cellular system, not home area code.  Most of
my home cell system is in ac 315 although I'm in 607, and seven digit
dialing to 607 works on the whole area.

Most peculiar.  Mine doesn't do that.

She's right.  Cingular phones don't work on AT&T either, different
software.  They're all programmed to use their preferred carrier
if possible, even if there's a stronger signal from someone else.

Honest, mine doesn't.  Maybe it's AT&T software.

I'm not sure whether this is a GSM "thing" or not, but I can be in
Amsterdam with my SIM from my US T-Mobile account and put the SIM into
a GSM 900/1800 phone and dial just seven digits and the call will
complete to a local number in Seattle as if I was back in Seattle,
Washington in the US.  This seems to contradict that it is the "phone"
that is storing the ability to do my local dialing procedure.  I can
also while overseas use "local rules" to dial local numbers there e.g.
in Amsterdam I can dial 020-31 NX NXXXXX and calls will complete or I
can always use the +31NX NXXXXXX to dial.

I guess you folks in North America view SMS as a dog, in Dr. Johnson's

not-part-of-the-main-gig of voice service of mobile comms, that we
don't bother critically judging it.

That is not true out here where the rubber meets the road of Asia.
That includes places like Singapore that are nicer to live in, than
North America; and places that are shit-hole Third World.

First: how do we define "efficiency in useage of scarce resources" of
SMS implementations?   Bandwidth, transmit power (some sites need to
be solar/windmill-powered), fone-battery power, time that a channel is
tied up, etc.

Second:  where to read up on the issues?

Third:  who *is* the "most" efficient?  specify your metric.

A 'domain name' is something that can be looked up via 'DNS', the "Domain
Name Service".

If DNS admits it exists, it is a domain name.  If not, it's not.

At a minimum, it must be registered/recorded with the local DNS server.

Yes.

NO.  Some types of URL _may_ contain a domain-name as part of the locater.

NO. Format of the 'rest' of the URL depends *entirely* on the 'protocol'
used.  which may, or may not, include a domain name, either as part of
a hostname, or otherwise.

> Is any remaining stuff within successive slashes more properly referred

NO.  everything after the ':' is the "path" to the resource.  How the
path is interpreted is dependant  -totally- on the 'protocol' specified
in the URL.

no.

All _publicly_recognized_ domain names are part of a hierarchical
system consisting of a LIMITED SET of 'top level domains'.  There are,
currently, 9 TLDs recognized, above and beyond the two-letter
'national', or 'country code' domains.'

Posession of a domain (name) allows one to create _anything_ that
falls _under_/_below_ that domain.  If you 'own' "foo.bar", you can
create "www.foo.bar", "baz.foo.bar", "info.foo.bar", etc., ad nauseum.
All that is necessary is to put that information into _your_ DNS
server -- the one the public consults to find out about 'anything' in
the 'foo.bar' domain.

A URL is -not- copyrightable.  Does not meet the 'creative effort'
requirement.  A domain name is -not- copyrightable.  Too 'small' to be
considered a 'work'.

Trademark _can_ apply to a domain name.  Depends on the name.  

In some cases, there *might* be a trademark issue with regard to other
elements of a URL 'path'.

For domain names, You can find the gory 'mechanical' details in the
documents that define the DNS system.  RFC 1034, RFC 1035, RFC 1101,

A complete red herring, in my opinion. The chances of accidentally

Typical American xenophobia, if I may say so.

This claim is frankly ludicrous. From experience, using 011+ is the
*usual* situation. Most such calls are made from hotel rooms or mobile
phones (at extortionate expense) because it's convenient and private
and the calls are only short or are paid for by the company. Or, in
the American branch office of a company they are made from a
colleague's phone. Only frequent travellers and heavy callers bother
with calling cards and the like.

True, but that's no excuse for making things hard for travellers. And
of course, it means that a change to the IDD code would not bother
most Americans.

True, which is why we have sorted out our IDD and regard "fortress

Subject: Cellular Calls and Other Distractions While Driving 
Date: Wed, 4 Dec 2002 09:41:07 -0500
From: Cywinski, Robert <RCywi@spring-ford.net>


There isn't much, if any, hoopla about people eating or smoking while
driving. Although these two activities don't require much thought. Has
there ever been a study about that? It is not likely that a person
will put down a cell phone while negotiating a turn or backing out of
a parking space. Personally, I do. I politely say "hang on a minute"
and toss the phone on the passenger seat. Last week I was nearly run
down in a parking lot by a person who had just backed out of a space
and had the phone in one hand and was attempting to complete the turn
with the other. Unfortunately, we can't have laws for people with no
common sense and that's what it comes down to. I find it disturbing
that someone did a study to find that the benefit of saved lives due
to the availability of cell phones outweighs the death and destruction
caused by people on the phone.

Although I might agree that a fine of $500 or so for causing an accident
because of a cell phone is justified, would this really deter usage? I
think not. But, who knows? The law says we have to wear seat belts and I
don't agree with that. It is a common sense decision for me to do so to
protect myself. A police officer can stop and cite me for not having it
on. However, not wearing it does not affect my driving. So should there
be a law about the cell phones? I think this would fall under "reckless
driving" because that's what it is. Let the cellular community balk
about that.

That's interesting. Since cell phone users derive this alleged
economic benefit from using their phones while driving, would they be
willing to bear the economic burden of increased accidents on the road
allegedly caused by those phones?

Would cell phone users be willing to pay a $500 fee if they were using
their cell phone at the time of an accident? How about a flat fee for
each activated cell phone in the US? How about a a per-minute usage
charge? Or maybe charging users whenever their connection is handed
off to a new cell -- when they're moving?

No matter what system would be chosen. I'm certain the cellular
community would balk at any such charges.

Y'know, some of us don't subscribe to all of this white-bashing.  As
for the reservations, well, I can't speak for any US reservations, but
there's a few around here -- in fact, the city of Calgary borders onto
the T'suu T'ina Nation (formerly known as the Sarcee Reserve), and
there's several others within a few hours' drive.  Now, the whole idea
behind reservations was to allow natives to continue living the way
they had in the past.  Any native who wished to do so COULD DO SO --
the land is excellent, wildlife is abundant.

And none of them do.

Yeah, ok, so it's our presence so close by that "corrupts" them.  That
must be it.  Actually, the problem is that our government, in its
compassion, pays all natives to live on the reserve -- and pays them
quite well, in fact, to the point where many (not all of course) have
pretty much lost much of their desire to work, either "for a living"
in the white man's world or to work the land on the reservation.  Why
bother?  The government cheque comes every month, and you can buy what
you need -- including alcohol.  The T'suu T'ina Nation is a "dry"
reserve, yet has one of the highest alcoholism rates in the world.

I am not going to apologize for Christopher Columbus or any acts
perpetrated against the native population in the past.  The only thing
I or you or anyone can do is deal with the present and the future.
We're HERE now.  We're not going to pack up 300+ million "non-natives"
from the US and Canada and move 'em all back to Europe, leaving the
continent to the natives.  No, that's not going to happen.

The United States is (was?) the great "melting pot".  We do our
greatest kindness to natives by allowing them (their choice) the
opportunity to join our society and prosper within it, or by allowing
them to stay on their reserves and carve out a life there WITHOUT
ASSISTANCE OR INTERFERENCE from the rest of us.

Sorry Pat, but I'd have laughed in your face and walked past you.  Let
me ask you this: since she had already indicated to you that she had
given money on Wednesday, what gave you the right to question the size
of her donation?  Did you first examine her financial records to
determine what size of gift would be appropriate?  Did you even find
out how much money she HAD already given on Wednesday?

Pat, nobody likes to be shamed into charity, and I for one have a
strict policy: if any charity tries to SHAME me into giving, they
don't get a dime from me.  Those that stay away from that tactic, get
my donations.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Your fourth paragraph tells where
things are really at with you: 'Not going to apologize for Chris
Columbus and others in that era.' Do you feel it has now been so long
ago, everyone should just forget about it? I mean, the Europeans (of
that day) just moved in and took over. The ancestors of the Europeans
of that day are now referred to as Americans of course, but one thing
continues to live on; their arrogance and feelings of superiority. 

In speaking with that lady, SHE initiated the conversation, "I gave
money on Wednesday." I merely continued the conversation; I did not
'shame' her into giving more, nor did I question or ask the amount
she had given. She could have initially walked on past (many folks do
just that) or upon my response she could have resumed walking. I know
nothing about what she had or had not given on 'Wednesday'. I was only
attempting to speak in the context of the sign on my collection
bucket: 'need knows no season'. Oddly, I have found 'my' most generous
givers are the old bag ladies and the men who appear to be 'bums' and
down on their luck.  They'll take wads of bills and put them in the
pot, and then apologize they can't do better ... :(  Three or four of
the guys who haul groceries out to the cars in the parking lot for 
shoppers at Marvins treat me very well; in addition to bringing me
cups of coffee or sandwiches from the deli at Marvins, two or three 
times per night they will come past and drop loose change in the
pot. I found out last night why they were doing that. Apparently
the local store management reimburses the kids who chose to give their
tip money (from shoppers) to the pot, or some part of the tip money. I
guess also that as long as we are there (until December 24) the store
management told the deli workers to provide us with food to eat. But
I dunno ... it is getting *very cold* at night out there, and we had
about three inches of snow today.  PAT]

It is possible to find out which carrier the number was allocated to
originally, but if it's been ported you can't find out.

Indeed there is - you can download a copy of NANPA's utilized database

Is this a homework question?

> What is a "domain name"?  Are a domain name and a URL equivalent?
> In some URL like

The domain name is yyy.org.  The whole thing is a URL.

www.xxx are generally called "subdomains."

Only "yyy.org" is registered.  As part of the registration, Domain Name 
Servers are associated with the domain, and those Domain Name Servers 
store and serve the IP addresses for all the servers in the domain - 
mail, web, ftp, etc servers.

> Is a domain name a domain name only if it's registered?

unregisteredname987.com is a well-formed domain name which is not 
registered.  But it's of theoretical interest only.  No one can use a 
domain name for anything until it is registered and DNS is set up.

> Can intranets have "effective internal domain names" that are
> not "real Internet-wide domain names"?

Yes.  This technique is frequently used for subdomains.  It would not be 
wise for a domain name, as it might lead to collisions or other failures.

Yes.

A better term is "path." It is generally the filepath on the Web server.

No - for example, my.yahoo.com.  ftp and telnet hosts are generally 
prefixed "ftp" and "telnet".

This is an area that is rapidly evolving.  The Anti-Cybersquatting 
Consumer Protection Act tried to resolve some issues in this.  Read it.  
But there are many areas which are not yet - and probably never will be - 
cleared up completely.  Outside of cyberspace, organizations can share a 
mark - Delta Air Lines, Delta Tool, and Delta Woodworking Machinery can 
coexist, for example.  But there is exactly one delta.com.

I'm sure John knows the difference, but one should be careful with
carrier provided ANI vs. Calling Party Number.  My employer has a
service from a large carrier who shall remain nameless, and they
insist that we are currently receiving ANI on our toll-free number
(direct dedicated T1 with ANI and DNIS digits, NOT ani as cpn via
POTS/CLASS), when in fact I have confirmed that they are transmitting
CPN/CallerID as ANI instead of true ANI.  For most people, interested
in single POTS lines, this isn't a big deal, but from a large user
perspective, can make a big difference.

Yes ... when using a toll-free number the 'owner' of the toll-free
number (the recipient of the call) is paying for the call, therefore
they have the right to know 'who' is calling them.

If cell phones truly cause accidents, you would expect the accident
rate to have soared over the past few years. Yet it hasn't. Perhaps
it's certain drivers who cause accidents, and if they didn't have cell
phones they would cause the accidents for a different reason.

Subject: Samsung n300 
Date: Wed, 4 Dec 2002 14:54:55 -0500


I am trying to convert my Samsung n300 cdma phone from Sprint PCS to
Verizon wireless.  I have a helpful person looking in to converting this
phone over at Verizon but Sprint isn't being helpful.  I found one guy at
Sprint that told me it should be an easy switch and then I got nowhere.

I believe that my phone is unlocked.  My contract was up with Sprint and
the one helpful guy that I spoke with at Sprint told me that it should be
unlocked, and that it was a matter of changing the prl.

I would like to know where I can read up on this to become educated so
that when I talk to these people I can know what I am talking about.

For some more background ... I went in to the Vzw store and handed them my
n300.  This guy popped it in the firmware updater and tried to get it to
flash to the firmware that they use for their n300s.  He handed it back to
me and told me that he needed the programing codes for it.  So I called
Sprint from the n300.  As soon as the call went through Sprint wanted to
update my firmware which they did while I waited on hold.  This I thought
was pretty interesting seeing as how I hadn't had it updated in a while
and I had just dialed them from my handset last week.  I then spoke with a
Sprint customer service person who gave me this BS about how my handset
was a PCS handset and that it wouldn't work on someone else's network.  I
left the store with out accomplishing anything.  The n300 proceeded to
work that day and in to the next morning.  The next day I power cycled the
phone and it came up not configured.  It no longer knew it's phone number.
Every call I tried to make the Sprint recording told me that my phone was
not yet configured and I needed to call Sprint to have them configure it.

Thanks for any help in advance.

I submit that the complainant does not understand the concept of "spam".

Spam is advertising or solicitation that is excruciatingly redundant,
promotes something that is of questionable or no value, and/or seeks
to present its message to its recipient despite explicit or implicit
rejection or avoidance of that message by the recipient.

Our moderator's entreaty for consideration given in return for value
received does not reasonably fit any of those categories.

It is no more "redundant" than any of the other housekeeping messages
and information, in that it is only repeated -- rather infrequently --
to those who repeatedly use the Digest.

Those who repeatedly use the Digest must surely find it useful and
valuable.  Those who don't find it useful and valuable can avoid the
"spam" by not availing themselves of the Digest.

I have to wonder whether the complainant can tell the difference
between a TV commercial and a telemarketing call -- as well as make
other distinctions involving, say, anatomical features and
excavations ...

The "personal opinion" disclaimer _certainly_ applies to this missive. In
fact, let's keep the company out of it.

I think it is reasonable for Pat to post the "begging" messages once
or twice a month, or maybe even weekly (but I hope that's not
necessary.

BUT getting the message two days in a row is a bit much.  How about
doing it on the 1st and 15th of every month?  That way the messages
would be spread around more evenly and "occasional lurkers" might have
a greater chance to see the messages.

As for PBS, my problem with them is that they are getting WORSE than
commercial channels!  You can pretty much count on a series of
commercials to be finished in two or three minutes, but those PBS
betting messages go on for at least a half hour.  Then they play the
real program for maybe a half hour or 45 minutes.  Then they do
another half hour of begging.  I have gotten to where I don't even
tune in to PBS during "membership" week.  I just renew my membership
when the due date comes around because I like much of their programs
(like Ken Burns productions, NOVA, etc.

I'd rather see them spread out and posted on the 1st and 15th OR the
15th and last day of the month to spread out the message a little
more.  It will seem less like spam.  I don't agree that this is spam
at all.  But even "good" advertising can get to be irritating if there
is too much of it.

I am convinced that you didn't intend to double post both of those
messages.  It happened, though, and maybe that is why this person got
upset.


Some list moderators put a "list signature" at the end of every
message.  Pat doesn't do that, at least not on the usenet version that
I read.  It wouldn't be unreasonable to put such a tag at the ends of
at least some messages to remind people of the URLs and address for
sending contributions.

Another idea, Pat.  How about doing what the advertisers do and have
some entertainment in your messages?  I don't know what it would be.
This is a text group, so you can't show graphics of telephones flying
through space and blowing each other up or speeding through mountains
and through rivers and coming back out without a single spot on the
phone surfaces.

How about the Verizon Wireless ads where the guy is going all through
the mountains and deserts and saying, "Can you hear me now? ....
Good!"

Greetings,

The Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania
(www.ldc.upenn.edu) needs participants for FISHER, a new telephone
speech study to be conducted in the Early Winter 2002-2003.  In
contrast to prior regional studies (Switchboard), FISHER will be
national (North America).  The FISHER project will be undertaken to
support linguistic research, technology development and education.
All calls will be recorded for these purposes.  Particpant Identities
will be kept strictly confidential and not released with the data.

FISHER participants will take part in 1 to 3 telephone calls talking
to other participants on suggested topics for ten minutes.  FISHER
topics can be found at the URL below:

http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/EARS/Fisher/topics.html

A robot operator will initiate all calls. Particpants need only answer
their phones at the time they specify during the registration process.

Participants will be compensated $10 per call.  In addition, for each
call made, participants will be eligble for 1 chance at (3) $1000.00
lottery prizes.

To register for this study please see the following page:

It's all about the money, my friend. Money is the only the that the
"artists" care about. They don't give a care about the fans, but they
sure care about their own wallets.

They don't even care about the music the produce and are only
concerned with who will pay how much for it.

Unlocking the phone (removing the carrier/network information) is only
a part of the problem in the North American Cellular Network.  Another
piece of the puzzle in moving phones from one compatible network to
another is the ESN or electronic serial number of the phone.  Most
carriers buy their phones in bulk from the manufacturers and as such
get blocks of ESNs assigned to them.  The ESN not only provides a
unique serial number id for the phone, it also identifies the
manufacturer and model.

Carriers enter the serial number ranges from "their" phones into the
computers controlling the network for the purpose of fraud prevention.
In order to register a "foreign" phone on the network, the databases
for the entire network have to be modified to include your phone's ESN
which is outside the range of their phones.  So, the ESN has to be in
the system, and the carrier information must also match.  If the ESN
is not in the system, the carrier information is checked for a roaming
agreement, and if not present the phone call is blocked.

That is a very simplified explination of how a carrier handles calls
from cellular instruments.  But as far as your question about getting
your phone moved from Sprint to Verizon, it is possible, but with a
lot of cooperation from both carriers.  Sprint has to provide the
programming codes to "unlock" their codes and Verizon has to be
willing to add your phone's ESN to their fraud protection systems.

For the most part, it is a matter of pushing some buttons, both on the
phone and a computer - but the maintenance of "foreign" ESNs is an
ongoing expense VZW may not want to undertake.  Moving to a GSM phone
using a SIM (Subscriber Information Module) card doesn't really make
it any easier.  In this instance you have to unlock the carrier codes
and then get a SIM from the new carrier.  It is the codes required to
lock and unlock the phone that are the problem.  Most of the codes to
program a phone are easily researched and located on the Internet,
lock and unlock codes may require a new PROM chip as some phone chips
cannot be altered after they have been burned in at the factory.  As
the phone works and is not stolen, selling it on E-Bay or something
similar may be the only way to recoup some of the cost of buying a new
phone from VZW.

The portion of the study that I heard quoted indicated that 26,000
people died last year as a result of an accident while someone was on
a cell phone.  But if morons are the ones that can't drive and talk at
the same time, is it merely conjecture that 25,000 of those accidents
would have occurred anyway?

AM radios were banned while driving in the early part of the last century.

If nothing else material had been altered in the safety of
automobiles, that would be a valid assertion. However, several
statistically significant changes have happened in the last ten years:

o Compliance with seat belt laws is significantly higher. I believe
the numbers have gone from 39% in the early 1990s to approximately 75%
today.

o Driver-side air bags have gone from an optional luxury to mandatory.
Many vehicles now also have passenger bags and side bags.

o While not in all vehicles, anti-lock braking systems is now
available as an option in most lines. 

o Consumers have been paying attention to government vehicle safety
reports and are selecting vehicles that get good grades in these crash
simulations. This has in turn caused manufacturers to design their
vehicles so they will score well in those tests. When in a collision,
modern vehicles will, on average, protect you better than older
designs.

o States are creating more stringent standards for DUI. The feds are
mandating a .08 level for DUI; states that keep a more lax standard
may risk getting federal highway dollars.

o Programs like the "#DUI" where cell phone callers can rapidly alert
cops to drunk drivers help remove these folk from the road more
quickly.  I do appreciate the irony of this point.

We don't know what statistical methodology went into the Harvard
study. One fondly hopes they found a way to create a valid correlation
between the use of cell phones in an automobile and the less safe
behavior.

What I would like to see is the delta in the numbers between regular
cell phone users and hands free cell phone users. Antecdotally, I do
not mind hands free users (I suspect I don't even notice many of
them). If hands free usage is found to be significantly safer than
handheld usage, I would like to see hands free use mandated.

In the US, cellular numbers aren't portable, so the assigned carrier is
almost certainly the current carrier.

In the US, we don't *YET* have number portability for wireless, but it
is supposed to be on the horizon in the near future. In the meantime,
the full URL for listings of prefix assignments on the NANPA site is
<http://www.nanpa.com/number_resource_info/co_code_assignments1.html>
with your choice of tab-delimited text, Excel, or Access format.

Of course, you have to download at least a multi-state region and then
sift through all the NXX's (not just wireless) to find the one you're
interested in. Also, you have to contend with wireless assignments of
less than a full NXX. For example, 361-645-1xxx, -2xxx, -3xxx, and
-8xxx are landlines, but -4xxx are wireless. However, most wireless
assignments are still by full prefixes.

Once full number portability comes to wireless carriers, there will be
no easy way to find out the carrier for a given number, just as there
is no easy way to tell now with landlines. For example, 415-552-xxxx
started out life as a Pacific Bell line, but now it could be any CLEC
serving San Francisco. Pacific Bell is still a better bet than all
other players combined, but far from a sure thing.

Stickier yet, there is talk of full portability between wireless and
landline carriers. Thus, you won't even be able to tell much of
anything about a given phone number. That will also provide a problem
for cold-calling telemarketers, since every call to a wireless phone is
subject to $500 in civil damages under 47 USC 227.

As for the UK, a previous response indicated that they already have
full portability of wireless numbers, leaving no easy way to tell the
carrier. For obvious reasons (separate area code ranges), the UK does
not and will not have portability between wireless and landline
carriers.

By Jim Hu
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
December 5, 2002, 1:41 PM PT

Friday will mark the final day for public comment on a Federal
Communications Commission proposal that requires digital TV sets to
implement anti-piracy technology.

If the FCC approves the proposal, TV manufacturers will be required to
install technologies to prevent illicit distribution of digital
broadcasts. Digital broadcast signals would be encoded with a
"broadcast flag" indicating that TV shows may not be broadcast freely.

The proposed rule has stirred up heated debate between technology
companies and the entertainment industry. Many consumer-electronics
and PC manufacturers oppose the regulation, claiming it would limit
consumers' use of recorded content. But entertainment companies, which
have pushed hardest for the requirement, say it would help fight
piracy and unwarranted distribution of their content on the Internet.

By SIMON ROMERO

Remember all the talk about the broadband revolution? It is turning 
out to be a slow evolution, at best.

Only about 15 percent of American households currently subscribe to 
broadband service - or fast Internet access - despite the fact that 
70 percent of households have the technical option of doing so. And 
analysts do not expect the majority of homes to have broadband access 
anytime for at least five years.

That means any company, whether America Online or any other Internet

anytime soon.

Subject: Digital Robber Barons?


By PAUL KRUGMAN

Bad metaphors make bad policy. Everyone talks about the "information 
highway." But in economic terms the telecommunications network 
resembles not a highway but the railroad industry of the robber-baron 
era -- that is, before it faced effective competition from trucking. 
And railroads eventually faced tough regulation, for good reason: 
they had a lot of market power, and often abused it.

Yet the people making choices today about the future of the Internet 
 -- above all Michael Powell, chairman of the Federal Communications 
Commission -- seem unaware of this history. They are full of 
enthusiasm for the wonders of deregulation, dismissive of concerns 
about market power. And meanwhile tomorrow's robber barons are 
fortifying their castles.

Until recently, the Internet seemed the very embodiment of the
free-market ideal -- a place where thousands of service providers
competed, where anyone could visit any site. And the tech sector was a
fertile breeding ground for libertarian ideology, with many techies
asserting that they needed neither help nor regulation from
Washington.

Subject: Being Online Without a Hard Drive


Let's say your hard drive has crashed, or somehow gotten wiped out,
formatted mysteriously or whatever. Does that mean you cannot get on
line or do other work with computer until you get the problem fixed?

No, not any more ... :) I received a gift from my California friend
which cures that sort of problem. It is called *KNOPPIX* which is an
entire *nix-based operating system on a CD.  Seriously ... what you
have to do is change your BIOS around a little as needed. Make sure it
is set to boot *first* from the CD, *then* from the hard drive.  I
think most people have it that way anyway. But if you don't you may
want to make that adjustment. Then your hard drive could be in pieces
on your work bench for example, and you WILL be able to get on the
net.

Or, when you grow weary of using Windows (I cannot imagine why anyone
would dislike such a fine product) -- snicker! -- what you do is pop
your knoppix CD in the drive, let it boot up, and presto, an almost
entire x-windows/linux thing. The best part seems to be if your hard
drive is *not* demolished, but actually there and working; you will
notice how part of the boot up process of the knoppix CD is to mount
your existing file storage areas (like the hard drive for example) and
you can use many of your 'regular' files as though they were *nix in
their nature.

One disadvantage is you have to have sufficient swap space on your
computer to make it work correctly. Without sufficent space on the
computer, things do get cluttered and it tends to run a little slower
than I would like. You do get a lot or most of the x-windows features
however. When you boot this knoppix CD, the first thing it does is
goes through your computer and takes an 'inventory' of everything
on your system; where to find the sound card for example, where to
find your modem or DSL or cable connection, etc, then it configures
itself accordingly. 

Another drawback is that nothing remains static. Whatever configur-
ations you first give it on logging in to start using it have to be
done every time you log in using it.  I am trying to figure out a way
to load it all from the CD onto my drive F so I can keep the
configurations I want on a permanent basis.

'Drive F' = a Fujifilm USB drive about the size of my finger which has
a male USB connector on the end, and plugs into a USB socket. Mine has
a 'mere' 64 MB of storage space, and the power on the line is enough
to power it and keep it going. They come in sizes from 16 MB up to 512 MB
all about the size of your finger, they weigh about an ounce and can
be clipped in your shirt pocket and carried around from one computer
to another. When I first received mine and plugged it into the USB hub 
(hub looks like an extension cord; one end plugs in the socket on the
back of the computer, the other end terminates in a multiple number of
USB female sockets; you plug your various USB devices in there). Anyway,
when I got it, I immediatly plugged it into the hub, the Windows XP
machine gave its little beep and flashed a message on the screen
saying "external storage device 'for pat' is ready to use." 'for pat' 
is the name that my friend gave it when he plugged it in his Apple Mac
to test it out. When I go to 'my computer' here, I see a similar file
folder, which I have since renamed 'USB Storage'. Click on that file,
and there you are, ready to store/delete, whatever.

Anyway, what I am trying to do is 'copy E to F'   (that is to say
move the contents of the CD over to the Fujifilm (fits in your shirt
pocket storage device). You can copy it over there with room to spare,
but the catch is you have to be already booted up (in Windows for
example) to get in there and use it. And that sort of maneuver not
only defeats the purpose of the Knoppix CD, it also confuses the hell
out of the computer, having Windows trying to run Knoppix. If you try
to load the computer from drive F by telling the BIOS to look in there
(F) and load if possible, it won't do that either. So if I can figure
out how to keep a few configs stored there which I can autoload 
somehow from F after I have loaded the Knoppix CD that will save some
time and allow me to use it instead of Windows, period. My brain
desease however is not allowing me to get that far up in my thinking. 

The nice thing about the Fujifilm storage device however is I can
unplug it from the XP hub and carry it over to my 98 laptop and 
load it with programs which I then cart back over to the XP and
use. Ditto, my old Windows 95 which has a convenient USB port on
the back side of it. The 98 requires a 'driver' to be installed to
use it, but supposedly the Windows 95 does not. 

Anyway, do take a look at Knoppix. You can find it using Google
search I understand, or get someone to burn a copy of it for you if
you do not have a way to download it and burn it yourself. Knoppix
is a great Christ Mass gift from my friend, and so was the Fujifilm
64 MB 'pen' which I can carry in my pocket.

You forgot .kids, which is to be free of any adult material. But I

Let me ask you two questions, Pat.

1) Why should I apologize for any of those people?  I wasn't here. 
They're not related to me either directly or indirectly (well, maybe
WAY, WAY back in the ol' family tree).  My paternal
great-grandparents (both sides) emigrated to Canada from Sweden in
the early 1900's.  My mother emigrated to Canada in 1965 from
England.  We had nothing to do with any of these events.  And even if
my relatives came over on the Mayflower, *THEY* are the
"perpetrators".  Not me, not my family.  Forget about these things? 
No.  Continue to feel guilty about them?  Hell no.  Why should *I*
apologize on behalf of the "perpetrators"?  They had their chance to
do so.

2) When do the hatred and hard feelings end, Pat?  Look at the lunacy
going on in, say, Northern Ireland right now.  You've got two
religious groups doing battle on an almost daily basis over a tiff
that started centuries ago.  One side attacks the other.  The attacked
side retaliates the next day.  WHEN DOES IT END?  When we've destroyed
each other?  Or can we come together at some point, forgive past
transgressions, and agree to build a new future together?

BTW, I feel the same way about this "slavery reparations" argument
that comes up from time to time.  Nobody living today ever benefited
from slavery, and nobody living today ever was victimized by it (note:
when I say "slavery", I'm talking about the legal institution of
slavery, and leaving out isolated criminal incidents that have
happened since emancipation).  Why should those who never benefited
have to pay reparations to those who were never harmed?  Yes, slavery
was A Bad Thing<tm>, but again - how long are we going to be angry at
each other?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I've worked my family tree back to 1635
on my father's side of the family; the *original* Townsends here in
the USA came from England around that time. One of the Townsend bunch
migrated from Long Island, NY down to the Carolinas, then through the
Appalachin Mountains into Georgia by sometime in the 1800's, then to
Blairsville, GA in the late 1800's; then via Tulsa, Indian Territory
and Tahlequah, Indian Territory (later Oklahoma) then into Coffeyville, 
KS at the start of the 20th century. On my mother's side, I have traced
the Mahans back to 1840 when they came from Ireland. I agree with you
that at some point the hostilities should come to an end. Maybe the
hostility will end when Dubya and his cronies get off their arrogance
kick regarding the middle east; in other words, no time soon.  PAT]

We could start (yet again) a whole argument on the "definition of
spam".  Suffice it to say that I don't agree with your definition: the
value of what the spam promotes doesn't enter into it.  I get lots of
spam pushing anti-virus products (well-established, well-known ones)
-- it's still spam.  It also doesn't have to be redundant: even one
such message is still spam.

What I think we CAN agree on is that spam is "unsolicited".  We
didn't ask for it, and we probably don't want it.

> Our moderator's entreaty for consideration given in return for value
> received does not reasonably fit any of those categories.

More to the point, I don't believe Pat's entreaties qualify as
"unsolicited".  I would argue the points that:

1) If you receive this via the Telecom Digest mailing list, you have
explicitly signed up to receive a service -- "value received",
indubitably.

2) If you receive this via the (moderated) newsgroup, you do so
knowing that SOMEBODY is doing the work of moderating the group and
thus has some measure of control over what's going on, and that by
participating you agree to that control.

Now, most of us own television sets.  We don't seem to have too much
of a problem with the idea that we can stick a pair of rabbit ears on
the TV and watch "free" TV, but we have to "pay" for it by watching
commercials.  Pat's monthly messages are this forum's "commercials",
and they're far, far less instrusive (even with a double-post).

That said, I love some of the other suggestions put forward (hey Pat,
pay attention!  heh heh!).  IE: Post the commercial ONCE each on the
1st and 15th, and then maybe stick a single line as part of the
regular "signature", something like this:

"To support the Telecom Digest, please visit http://www.someurl.com"

(which of course would be a page outlining, in more detail, exactly
what Pat does for us and why he needs our support, and of course
showing the way to make a donation.)

I used that in a self-depracating way (the Soviet Canuckistan bit),
but the simple fact of the matter is that Pat Buchanan was absolutely
right.  What most people ('specially north of the border) didn't
understand is that he wasn't referring to Canadians, but to the
Canadian government -- which is indeed a de-facto dictatorship and
does not respond to the will of the people.

As for "piss up a rope", be thankful I'm not British, or I might
"take the piss".  :-)

Pat, 

Your posts are not SPAM.  I agree with others that it might be more
effective for you to post in the middle of the month and at the end.

Please take the following part of this message as personal, and don't
post it.

If your willing to do a little work, there is a way to leverage your
reputation with the readers so you can earn a little income. 

I suggested this to you about five years ago, and you clearly didn't
understand what I meant (I wasn't as clear about the idea then as I
will be today), and flamed me in the newsgroup, so I've been quiet
ever since.  Perhaps you should examine the idea again.

You can set up a web site that is a portal.  This would be a virtual
tradeshow exhibition hall for all telecom equiment, supplies,
software, etc. -- all that stuff you've got years and years of
experience with.

So when someone says "i need an xxxx" they can go to your portal and
find the manufacturers.  I view this as being similar to a Trade Show
exhibit hall, in that if you want something in particular, you can find
a number of manufacturers.  And if you just want to browse  and see
what's new, you can do that also.

You can either charge companies to be listed there, or charge by
clickthrough.   You'll know the categories based on the questions that
often come up in this and related NGs.

I don't believe that this is "selling the telecom archives mailing
list."  

You may also set up a page on the  "virtual tradeshow" portal to gather
names and interests from volunteers.  This would be an "OPT-IN"
service that does not use the telecom archives mailing list.  You'd be
creating a NEW mailing list (not the telecom archives list) that you
could then sell.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The person who wrote this message is
not the same person whose message I put in anonymously originally. This
person who wrote this latest suggestion (about an Exhibit Hall sort of
thing with the Digest as part of it) makes an interesting suggestion. I
would like to hear more about it. The *only* way I would consider it 
would be if the telecom mailing list and anything to do with the 'trade
show exhibition hall' were kept <---------> this far apart from each
other. If someone would like to set up such a web site (it could *NOT*
be done on massis.lcs.mit.edu -- that would be Very Naughty --) I would
like to hear about it. Links on that 'virtual tradeshow' page could link
over here, and the other way around. But one serious problem would be,
how much courtesy do *I* have to give the trade show people?  If some
vendor started something that was really a rip off, do I have to stay
quiet about it here on the Digest?  Many of you may remember, but some
of you do not remember when Microsoft was a sponsor here a number of
years ago. Those of you who do remember thought it was a bum deal, and
that I would be marching to a new tune as of that day. As a matter of
fact I did not entertain any messages here denouncing Microsoft for 
over a year. And the money *they* paid me enabled me to live in the 
style to which I am (or was) accustomed for a year or so. 

I am *not* saying Microsoft is/was a 'ripoff', and I still do not say
much about them, but the messages I printed about them in those days
did leave me feeling a little squeamish at times. Then many of you
will remember how, for years, I had ITU as a sponsor here, then we
had that series of messages about ICANN and ITU got ticked and pulled
out. Robert Shaw of ITU was the ICANN booster who did that dirty deed,
but I have no hard feelings about it. I wonder just how long this
'virtual trade show/exhibition hall thing would last? If anyone wants
to try and start it and serve as the 'manager' of the Exhibition Hall,
then do so and keep me posted on it. But, I do have Mike Sandman for the
'I want to buy XXXX' purposes; Judith Oppenheimer for advice on toll-
free issues, etc. 

Now days, my de-facto 'sponsor' is Uncle Sugar, of course, compliments
of the nearly three months I spent comatose during the brain aneurysm
and the year or so afterward I spent in therapy and rehabilitation. 
Uncle Sugar lets *anyone* sass him; he just does not pay attention,
and even I know where to draw the line on giving him a *really* hard
time. And for whatever bad things we can say about him, at least he
does not spam the net, and he enables me to sit around at my computer
all day doing things like http://weatherforecast.n3.net ,
http://friends-of-indy.n3.net , http://telecom-digest.org/fixclock/ 
and similar for my own amusement. 
		   
Let's give some serious thought to the exhibition hall idea. And as
for you, anonymous poster who requested name witheld, I *am* sorry you
felt very put-upon several years ago and remained silent since
then. Really, I am. I do not even remember the spat we had back then. 
All is forgiven, okay?  PAT]

Subject: WebCam: A Sight for Sore Eyes


Mike Sandman recently referred me to a most unusual site on the net that
I want to tell you about, and ask for some suggestions on the software.

Mike has some baby birds which you can view if you go to his website
for his online catalog http://www.sandman.com and follow the prompts
to see the baby birds. Anyway, in the conversation he told me about
this weird site called 'CameraWare' which appears to be entirely
sexual and very explicit in nature. They do have a category on there
for folks who want to do *other things* (besides sex all the time) but
I saw no one in that section. Look at Google or some other engine
under 'cameraware' as one word to find it. You get two downloads from
them: one is the input mode which takes whatever image you give it and
puts it on the net 24 hours per day at no charge. The software is
free, putting it on the net is free. Where they get you is on the
ability to *look at other guys on cam*.  

For that, you have to have a 'license' for various amounts of
time. Presently they are giving a promotion where you get to peek for
free :) for 15 minutes at a time. And the system is loaded all the
time, hundreds of people showing off and probably several thousand
other folks looking. It is a lot of fun, but not if you are easily
offended. And they give you cookies to keep track of who is looking at
what, etc. I keep it all on my Fujifilm drive F and bogus login names,
etc so it can be abolished in a minute if I decide I don't want it
around.  When I say showing off, I mean NOTHING is left to the
imagination.  I think the address is http://cameraware.com but check
the search engines to be certain of that.

What I would like to know is if there is any freeware video sending/
receiving software around?   I would like to use that technique 
myself to show people watching around my yard, etc, but frankly I
would be embarrassed to use a service like cameraware; even with a 
page to get direct to your show, folks would wind up going through all
that other stuff, and I have a reputation to keep up, you know. :)  If 
I could fix it to be commercial free and license free, just a way to
focus a cam on something and let people look at a web page to see
the picture. Supposedly there are hacks out there on cameraware set
up by hackers, etc, but I cannot find them.  Any ideas?  And only for
your own research of course, check out http://cameraware.com

One theory is that it ends when you have a legal system that's
*perceived* to be neutral (both the courts, and the cops on the
street). You shoot someone, you go to jail, regardless of which side
you're on. Eventually all the hard-core loonies are in jail, and
everyone else gets on with their lives. It doesn't work if the legal
system is *perceived* to be biased (eg, cops hassling one side but not
the other). That just creates more hard core loonies ...

I don't know how many times in history this has actually been
accomplished -- South Africa is the only one that comes to mind.  The
other possibility, of one side finally destroying the other, has
happened any number of times.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Thank you very much! You said it better

Xenophobia?  I think that's an unjust accusation.

Mark was just making the very reasonable point that there is no real
need for North America to go to the trouble and expense of adopting
the 00 IDDD prefix just to "conform" with Europe and some other parts
of the world.  The 011 code has served adequately for many years and
there is simply no need to change it.

Is it "making it hard" for travelers to expect them to dial 011
instead of 00 for an international call?  Anyone who can't take care
of that small difference when visiting the U.S.A. is going to have a
hard time coping with more mundane, and possibly risky situations,
such as learning who has priority at a 4-way stop sign.  (Maybe
America should do away with those useful devices as well, just because
Europe doesn't use them and they might confuse visitors?)

I'd bet that 90% of people in the U.K. (and many other European
countries) do not know their own country code in any case.  Those
people are going to have to check what they need to dial to call home
anyway, so it makes little difference if they have to remember 011 44
instead of 00 44, or whatever.

And for those Europeans who *do* make international calls on a regular
basis, don't forget that 00 has been in widespread use for only a
few years.  Europeans managed quite well with the variety of IDDD
prefixes that were used previously: 19, 07, 010, etc.  If they managed
to learn to use 00, why will they have trouble using 011 in America?

What if some sleepy traveler does accidentally start to dial 00+
anyhow?  He'll just get connected to the local Telco operator and
realize that he's dialed the wrong number -- No charge.

>> ...Europeans are more likely to place calls between countries...

> True, which is why we have sorted out our IDD and regard "fortress
> America" with such amusement!

I'd say it's more like Fortress Europe.  The authorities here aren't
content with dictating that everywhere from Finland to Greece and from
Ireland to Austria use the same standards, they now feel that America
should be "pulled into line" as well.

If anyone is going to change, it could be argued that 011 was
established as an IDDD prefix standard (an international standard,
let's add!) long before 00 gained popularity and that therefore Europe
should adopt 011.

The point is, however, that if America and Europe use different IDDD
access codes, it really doesn't matter that much.

Now, should *we* change to 911, or should America switch to 999?  Or
maybe 112?  ;)

That's ridiculous.  I've never heard of an LD carrier with a termination
fee.  Verizon themselves may charge you $5/line to switch LD carriers.

They seem to have two plans.  The "residential" plan is 3.9 cpm with a
$1.99 monthly fee, the "small business" plan is 4.9 cpm with no fee.
You have to make over 200 minutes/month of calls for the 3.9 cpm plan
to be cheaper, and 200 minutes is more than most people make.

I am awaiting ecg's reply to my request to straighten this out.

Right now the confirmation of service email from ecg said I would be
charge 4.9 Cents PLUS the $1.99 Fee.
I am sure all will be fine eventually.

Verizon stated that the $15.00 would be because I had two lines and
covered AT&T's charges as well.  Verizon had to make the switch of
carriers for me and they did so immediately upon my request:)

We received the software above when we installed our new MultiVantage
dual S8700 servers and new announcement board this Fall.

I just installed the software Friday night, and not matter what I try
or do, the software will connect to my main S8700 server over my LAN,
but doe snot see or find the board.

I also checked the ReadMe file and went through all the possible
problems and made sure I was hitting the correct port and card, all is
fine.

Any assistance or tips are appreciated.  We have installed four S8300
units with a G700 blade in them off our S8700's, and so far they are
working well.  As usual, there are patches and upgrades, both the
S8700 and the S8300 are going to a load 2.0 with two hundred plus
fixes according to information I have found.  It is FAR better then
the horrible R300 product which we were going to use for our small
office solution.

Thanks again ... Dave

Hi Pat,

You'd probably only need one or two links from Telecom Digest, (and an
occasional mention in the NG).

As a long-time reader, I doubt you would be able to stay quiet about
any rip-offs.  :-) And that may lose you an "exhibitor" or two.  But
it would increase the value of the "exhibit hall", which means that
you'll get more "exibitors" or be able to charge each "exhibitor"
more, or both.

On the other hand, if you were to endorse one or two products at the
expense of all others, it may alienate the other "exhibitors".

A simple statement on the "exhibit hall" that these are paid listings,
and you neither endorse them or evaluate them in depth would be
appropriate (if its true, of course).

I would expect you to use your experience and expertise to create an
easy to navigate set of web pages, and to categorize things
appropriately.  For a counter-example, Yahoo doesn't do a great job of
categorizeing Telecom.  The ease-of-finding-what-you-want (especially
when you don't know exactly what its called) is some of the value you
would add.

I suggest a low fee and a lot of subscribers, so that you're not
dependent on any one company.
 
Also, the more companies and categories you have, the more valuable
your site becomes because people will find what they are looking for.

I think they'll let you deduct it if it is used exclusively for business
purposes, such as might be the case in a home office.

Therefore, they would be *especially* suspicious it if it were the
only line coming in, because they would have to buy your presumption
that you *never* made any personal calls whatsoever.  They don't
really care what you pay for it or what the phone company calls it,
they care how it's actually used.

In either case, you can deduct business phone calls if you document
them, but the cost of the line itself is what's at issue.

Don't worry it is nothing to do with "com"unism. It may be that it
is because they are commercial businesses and thusly decided to 
protect themselves by renting different domain names. 

It may well have started like this: "Hey, I got our system up
and running and we already have users."  "Great, but our website
says "whatever".com instead of "whatever".net."   "I thought that
was what you wanted.  I could change it."  "No, that's alright."

Then across town ... "Hey, Bill, "whatever" is using .com instead
of .net.  We need to get with the 20th century ..."  And as they say,
the rest is history.

Yes, they still use .mil, but Milnet is separate from the commercial

Here's an opinion: When management of the domain name system was
handed over to Network Solutions, Inc (now part of Verisign), they
were more interested in making money than maintaining the vision
of the people who had originally set up DNS, so they opened .net
and .org up to everyone and encouraged large outfits to register
names in all three zones - they got more fees that way than by
keeping network providers in .net, noncommercial outfits in .org,
and non-network commercial firms in .com.  Too many ISPs understand
money better than they understand networking (or sometimes their
customers are like that), and they went for .com so their salescritters
wouldn't have to explain to customers what .net meant.

===================END FORWARDED MESSAGE===================

Absolutely correct.  I was thinking in terms of "publicly available"
ones only, but failed to make that clear: my bad.  Upon further
reflection, though, an .edu address is probably easier to obtain than
 .museum, .coop, .aero or .pro., so I shouldn't have even tried to make
that distinction.  Plus, while I was aware of the existence of these
extra five:

1) I had thought .arpa to be completely phased out and thus no longer
really in existence.  If I'm mistaken, then again: my bad.  :-)

2) I dunno, I had kinda lumped .int into my mind as sorta like ccTLD's.
Again upon further reflection, I guess it's more along the lines of
 .gov than any ccTLD, so point taken.

So, the above list (fifteen TLD's) account, to the best of my
knowledge, the range of TLD's outside of ccTLD's.

Aside to John Higdon.  .kids doesn't exist.  If you're going to be
paranoid, at least have the grace to be paranoid about the real world.

Very small nit-pick: it's any international organization, not just
international 'treaty' organizations. For example, <http://tpc.int> is
not a 'treaty' organization at all, although it is telecom-related.

Simple. Type any word or name into most web browsers and hit 'enter'.
If you type aslkjdflkasdflj, they will try:
http://aslkjdflkasdflj
http://aslkjdflkasdflj.com
http://www.aslkjdflkasdflj.com
in that order. They will never try dot-net, with or without the www
prefix, unless they also do a search engine dip and come up with that
site and not the dot-com version of the name.

Anyway, most ISPs I know of are *both* .com and .net of the same name
(e.g., earthlink.net and earthlink.com).

Pat--

You can use Netmeeting to show your camera to any (only one at a time)
person.  Are you familiar with Netmeeting?  It is part of all the
Windows programs (even XP, although it is hidden) and has audio and
video chat as well as the ability to transfer files and share the
desktop for helping fix problems.

Let me know if you want to experiment with Netmeeting.  

David

TELCOM Digest Editor's Note: Thanks for your note about net meeting. I
do know how to use it, although I do not have much interest in
it. Yahoo is superior in that you can use video in a meeting room with
several watching at once. If only one is watching and you both have
DSL (or any high speed broadband) then the two of you can use what
Yahoo calls 'super cam' or 'turbo cam' (not sure of the exact name)
but you get real time movement of arms, legs other body parts,
etc. Not just 'jerk motions' every eight or ten seconds. What I really
want is software that can take in images from my cam, and put them
back out on my web page, enabling any number of viewers. I will
install the cam in my back yard by my weather station 
( http://weatherforecast.n3.net ) so people can view the weather
conditions.

I *could* do this with cameraware.com but there is no way to do a
redirect (in a frame for example) TO MY PAGE ONLY (thus bypassing
all the rauchy stuff elsewhere on the site.)  I have tried, but the
outbound pages at cameraware are written in some exceptionally tricky
javascripts. I cannot get around them ... that I know of.

But thanks for the hint on metmeeting.  PAT]

That doesn't address the real question. Is Verizon telling you that
AT&T (your old carrier) is charging you (or charging Verizon) a fee for
your switch to ECG (your new carrier)?

If Verizon is in any way suggesting that AT&T will bill you a fee for
the change, they are lying to you.

If Verizon is in any way suggesting that they are charging you a fee
because AT&T charges them a fee for your change, they are lying to you.

Verizon will charge you a fee because they have to have someone change
the setting on your account, and that involves actual human labor. I
don't really know how much human labor, whether or not $7 to $8 is a
reasonable charge per line, but at least some work is performed.

If you have two lines, and you are changing both the inter-LATA and
intra-LATA carrier, then $15 is about what Verizon will charge you to
switch, but that doesn't "cover" *ANY* "AT&T charges" at all.

Depending on the terms under which you signed up, your new carrier may
or may not reimburse you the charge from Verizon to change carriers. My
most recent carrier change did not reimburse me, but their rates are
low enough I think I'll be net ahead in a couple of months, tops.

I'd like to ask the readers of this forum to help me with a little
informal, non-scientific survey on a subject near and dear to my
heart.  Specifically, I'd like to know what U.S. and Canadian readers
think of the quality of the area code map printed in the front of your
local phone book. (Readers from other parts of the world, I'd be
interested to know if your directories have similar maps, or only
lists of cities and towns.) Is it current? Is it accurate?

If you choose to participate in this survey, please include the
following information:

* city, state/province, and cover date of the directory (e.g.,
Foo-barre, IN, September 2002)

* dominant LEC(s) in the directory's service area (e.g., 80%
SBC/Ameritech, 20% Verizon/GTE)

* publisher of the directory (especially if it's not the dominant LEC)

I'm particularly interested to hear how well the smaller players
compare to the big boys.

You can, of course, use my own map on my web site as a reference point
for accuracy :-)

Subject: High-Speed Wireless Internet Network Is Planned


By JOHN MARKOFF

SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 5 - The wireless technology known as WiFi, which
allows users of personal and hand-held computers to connect to the
Internet at high speed without cables, got a significant stamp of
approval today when AT&T, I.B.M. and Intel announced a new company to
create a nationwide network.

The unruly technology, which has largely been a playground for 
hackers, hobbyists and high-technology start-ups, is already 
sprouting mushroomlike in coffee shops, bookstores, airports, hotels, 
homes, businesses and even a few parks.

The new company, Cometa Networks, has set ambitious goals for itself: 
to deploy more than 20,000 wireless access points by the end of 2004, 
placing an cable-less high-speed Internet connection within either a 
five-minute walk in urban areas or a five-minute drive in suburban 
communities.

Executives from the technology companies and the two investment firms,
Apax Partners and 3i, that joined to create the network said they
would begin offering their service through cellular and wired
telephone companies, D.S.L. and cable Internet service providers and
other Internet retailers some time in 2003.

The service is intended to let subscribers pop open their laptops and
have a seamless high-speed wireless extension of their personal or
corporate Internet services -- initially in the 50 largest
metropolitan areas -- without having to give credit card numbers or
enter additional information, as is generally the case now.
Connections would generally be at least the speed of a typical home
broadband connection.

Yeah everyone knows that Middle East violence is caused by President
Bush, and no violence existed before he took office.  Appeasing thugs
has always worked so well throughout history as well.  Tracing family
trees is fun, but what happened long before any of us were born is
hardly reason to feel guilty for world history.  Should we hang
ourselves with shame if our ancestors were part of the Roman Empire in
its imperial days too?  Should you feel guilty, and maybe even owe me
reparations, if your cave man ancestors attacked my family's ancient
cave?


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It isn't *quite* that simple. You make
several good points, but, although there has been violence in the
middle east over the years, it seems to me it is exaberated by the
United States. We can do nothing about Al-Quaida or Mr. Sodomy Insane,
but we do not have to egg them on, inviting them to cause trouble. The
USA should mind its business and stay out of troublesome situations
like the middle east. Why does the USA have to stick its nose into
things and then act so offended when someone retaliates. I mean, with 
the way the USA is *always* getting into things, it was only going to 
be a matter of time before one of those guys pushed back. When is the
last time you ever saw Switzerland get into a war?  Why did the attack
on WTC and the Pentagon cause so much consternation?  If you foolishly
mix up a bunch of volitile chemicals as Bush II, Clinton, Ray Gun, Bush I
have all done with their arrogance over the years, why don't you  expect
an explosion now and then?  I mean, the whole Bush family; what a hot
team! And Clinton was a liar/sex maniac from the start also. Look at 
Bush II and the 'Christians' who hang on his every word. He has no more
use for them than Clinton did for gay guys. Just another block of voters
to be lied to and hopefully appeased. But the 'Christians' keep egging
on Bush, hoping he will provide the Armaggeon they keep hoping for and
praying about.  

Regards the Indians we had started talking about; this was not just a
simple genocide; the earliest Americans literally wiped out the entire
nation. I don't see what good apologies would do either at this late
date, but I would like to see more modern-day Americans mortified and
embarassed by what happened; not just naming baseball and football
teams after Indians. But as long as the United States government stays
on its arrogant and foolish ways; I see no hope. 

Imagine this scenario: five hundred years from now, when the USA has
long been forgotten about except in history books as 'that nation
whose arrogance and foolishness and pride caused it to be defeated in
a major conflagration with the east 498 years ago .... ' the
newspapers (or whatever the media in that day happens to be) announces
a sports team playing in Bhagdad, called the 'Bhagdad Americans', who
will be competing in baseball against the 'Cairo Yankees'. What's the
difference when we now have a team called the 'Cleveland Indians'? The
oldest civilizations in the world lasted a few hundred years before
they were detroyed. How long did the Roman empire last? How long does
the 'American Empire' get before it also is gone?  We've been around
over two hundred years already, so our time is beginning to run short.
And around two or three hundred years into the Roman Empire, *they*
were pretty arrogant also and expected to be around forever. A hymn
we sang in church today was 'Turn Back Oh Man, Forswear Thy Foolish
Ways'. And our government, regretably, knows all about foolishness
and arrogance. So President Bush (or Dubya for short), here is an
Editor's Note just for you:  Al-Quaida is gonna get you if you don't
can the balogna pretty quick now.   Watch and see.  My Sunday Sermon
has already ran overtime for today.  Bye until tomorrow, everyone.

============================================================

MICROCELL MISSES DEBT PAYMENT: Microcell Telecom missed an interest
payment on its debt December 2. It must now pay within 30 days to
avoid default. The cellco says it is continuing refinancing
discussions with its banks and lenders.

** Dominion Bond Rating Service has reduced Microcell's debt
    rating to "D" -- its lowest.

GT CUTS STAFF BY ONE-THIRD: On December 5, Group Telecom laid off 250
employees, more than a third of its staff. GT says integration with
its new owner, 360networks, may result in further cuts.

BCE SUED OVER EXCEL, TELEGLOBE: Dallas-based VarTec Telecom, which
bought multi-level marketer Excel Communications for US$250 million
from BCE in April, is now suing to get its money back. VarTec says
BCE's decision to pull support from Excel's former parent, Teleglobe,
violated promises it made during negotiations.

** BCE says VarTec's claim is "without merit or foundation"
    and promises "to vigorously defend its position."

RIM INTROS TWO NEW BLACKBERRIES: Research In Motion has introduced
BlackBerry e-mail/phone devices that work on iDEN (Mike in Canada) and
1XRTT networks.

REPORT QUESTIONS BCE ACCOUNTING: Under Canadian accounting rules, BCE
has earned $10.77 billion since 1999, with very large year-to-year
swings. A new report by Mark Rosen of Accountability Research says
that using U.S. rules for the same period would change that to a $1.25
billion loss.

** Rosen criticizes the non-standard "baseline earnings"
    measure BCE often reports. By excluding one-time costs and
    gains, it puts BCE's earnings since 1999 at $4.36 billion,
    but with much less year-to-year volatility.

CGI BIDS TO ACQUIRE COGNICASE: CGI Group has offered to buy Cognicase,
another Montreal-based IT services outsourcer, for $313
million. Cognicase has formed a committee to consider the offer, which
its CEO says does not reflect the company's value.

BELL BROKE WINBACK RULES, CRTC SAYS: In a sharp reprimand, the CRTC
says Bell Canada violated regulations that require a 90-day waiting
period before a telco tries to win back a local customer who has
switched to a competitor. Bell argued that the ban did not include the
time before the actual switch took place; the CRTC says it begins when
the telco is informed of the customer's decision, and continues until
90 days after the switch is completed.

** Bell has 60 days to spell out the measures it will take to
    prevent further violations.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/2002/dt2002-73.htm

CRTC SEEKS COMMENT ON PAYPHONE ACCESS: In Public Notice 2002- 6, the
CRTC asks for comment on consumer reliance on public payphones, how
quickly telcos are withdrawing them from service, and whether
payphones should be more accessible to the deaf. Interested parties
must register by December 19, but those who simply want to submit a
written comment have until May 1 to do so.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/2002/pt2002-6.htm

CRTC CLARIFIES SCOPE OF CDNA PROCEEDING: In Decision 2002-75, the CRTC
says that the CDNA proceeding may consider variable markups and
compensation to competitors providing wholesale services, as well as
all other topics challenged by Telus in November. (See Telecom Update
#344, 351)

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/2002/dt2002-75.htm

VIDEOTRON HEARING ADJOURNED: On the request of Videotron and sports
broadcaster RDS, the CRTC adjourned last Monday's public hearing
because the parties said they were nearing agreement on the payments
Videotron owes RDS. If the two don't agree by January 13, the hearing
will reconvene. (See Telecom Update #360)

** Separately, the Federal Court of Appeal has granted
    Videotron's parent company, Quebecor Media, permission to
    appeal the CRTC's original order directing Videotron to
    pay the outstanding amounts to RDS (Broadcasting Decision
    2002-255). No date has been set for the appeal.

CABLE MODEMS FOR THIRD-PARTY INTERNET ACCESS: In Telecom Public Notice
2002-7, the CRTC expresses its preliminary view that ISPs who wish to
provide high-speed Internet service over cable TV facilities should
use DOCSIS 1.1-compliant cable modems certified by CableLabs and
tested by the cable carrier in question. To comment, notify the CRTC
by January 10.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/2002/pt2002-7.htm

TEXT MESSAGING DOUBLES IN EIGHT MONTHS: The Canadian Wireless
Telecommunications Association says that Canadians sent more than 20
million wireless text messages in November, double the level in April,
when inter-carrier messaging was introduced.

SHAW TO CUT CAPITAL SPENDING 50%: CEO Jim Shaw told Shaw
Communications' annual meeting December 4 that the cableco plans $335
million in capital spending next year, down from $683 million in
2002. Shaw expects to sell U.S. cable assets this month; it plans no
telephony venture in the next five years.

TELUS TO PROVIDE CPC OPERATOR SERVICE: Telus expects to gain $1.2
million in revenue from a new three-year agreement to provide operator
services for Canada Payphone Corp.

** CPC reports $3.1 million revenue and a $5.0 million loss
    for the year ending September 30.

RANDY BENSON LEAVES CALL-NET: Call-Net CEO Randy Benson has resigned,
effective December 31. No replacement has been announced. (See Telecom
Update #231)

CERTICOM LOSSES NARROW: Mississauga-based Certicom, which makes
wireless security products, had a US$1.7 million loss in the three
months ended October 31, compared to a $22.8 million loss a year
ago. Revenue declined 4% to $2.6 million; operating expenses fell 68%.

Here in Northern Utah, we have three telephone directories:

                 ======= QWEST ===========

Qwest's area-code map in the Ogden/North Davis [Utah] directory
for 2002-2003 is amazingly accurate.  A few recent codes are missing
(e.g., 325, 432, 575, 689), but most of these haven't implemented
anyway.  Requested info:

June 2003."

> dominant LEC(s) in the directory's service area
> (e.g., 80% SBC/Ameritech, 20% Verizon/GTE)

Qwest is dominant ILEC, at 100% as far as I know.  CLECS listed in
the Qwest directory:
      AT&T (residential and business)
      Electric Lightwave (business only)
      Integra Telecom (business only)
      Ionex (residential-vs.-business not specified)
      McLeodUSA (residential and business)
      Mpower Communications (business only)
      1-800-RECONEX (residential-vs.-business not specified)
      PAC WEST Telecom Inc. (business only)
      Tel West Communications LLC (residential and business)

> publisher of the directory (especially if it's not the dominant
> LEC)

QuestDex, Copyright 2002 Quest Communications International, Inc.

        ======= PHONE DIRECTORIES COMPANY ===========

This directory includes an area-code map provided by MapQuest.
It's not as accurate as Qwest's, but acceptable for most purposes.
Specific errors I noted:

   Several codes are missing; e.g. 325, 385, 424, 432, 475, 575, 667,
   709, 780, 959 (but, curiously, 689 *is* shown).

   867 is missing from the main map, although a sliver of
   it is shown on the Alaska inset.

   902 is identified as Nova Scotia only. 

   917 is identified as Manhattan only.

Requested info:

> city, state/province, and cover date of the directory (e.g....

Ogden, Utah: "Mt. Ogden Phone Directory."  Cover date: "2002-2003."

> dominant LEC(s) in the directory's service area

See Qwest, above.

> publisher of the directory (especially if it's not the dominant
> LEC)

Directory: Copyright 2003 (sic) Phone Directories Co., Inc.
Area Code map: Copyright 2002 MAPQUEST.

           ======= TRANSWESTERN PUBLISHING ===========

This directory includes a 1999 area-code map provided by Aegis
Publishing; it's the least accurate of the three.  Specific
errors I noted:

   424 is shown as an overlay, rather than a split.

   867 isn't shown on the map at all; in an accompanying list, it's
   identified only as "NT", ignoring the other two territories.

   Many recent codes are missing; e.g.:  229, 239, 260, 262, 269,
   289, 321, 325, 337, 347, 385, 386, 432, 445, 470, 475, 478,
   479, 563, 571, 574, 575, 585, 620, 631, 641, 646, 647, 667,
   682, 682, 687, 689, 731, 754, 763, 772, 835, 859, 863, 865,
   878, 928, 936, 939, 952, 959, 971, 979, 980, 984, 989 (and
   probably more, but I lost count).

Date: 9 Dec 2002 10:59:42 -0800

I have been trying to figure this one out, but have been unable to
find a solution.

Currently our system handles incoming calls via T1 and outgoing calls
via several cots. The problem that I have is that when someone places
a call, the number that shows and registers in the caller ID is the
cot number and not the actual DN. There has been several occassions
where a prank call has been placed and the individual calls back the
cot number. The cot number is setup to route to the attendant. I hav
been trying to change this for the last two days. Is there a way to
route to a partuicular DN or a RAN route?

Your help is greatly appreciated! thanks.

Hi everyone!

I couldn't find any info related with this on any of the FAQs so if I
am repeating something please apologize and kindly redirect me to the
appropriate site.

My question is related to the Mobile Application Part, application
context 3. What I want to know is, what advantages are there in
migrating to MAP v3? Does it have anything to do with GPRS? Does GPRS
need MAP v3? What new functionalities are available with MAP v3??


Thank you very much!

OK, wrong word I agree. It's not a fear of foreigners it's

Yes, it's a pain. At one stage I was travelling regularly between the
UK, US and Oz and remembering which country was 011, 0011 or 010 was
very confusing. I'm still not sure which was which. It's not always
easy to discover the correct code. And it's unnecessary.

Exactly! Another unnecessary, expensive and in this case dangerous
difference.

Well, no, the general idea when standardizing is that you keep the
good bits and throw out the bad. In fact, I believe this principle is
enshrined in law in the EEC harmonization arena.

I don't follow the bit about it being an international standard, but
I've got no problem whatever with adopting any particular code. We've
already changed IDD and emergency numbers in the UK (and just about
every other number as well!). I imagine there are practical reasons
for the choice of 00 over 011, and I admit that it's quite possible
that these same practical reasons prevent the Merkins doing the
opposite change. But that's not what the original rant was about.

Subject: Wi-Fi Internet Access Is Hot, But Profit Potential Is Tepid


By BARNABY J. FEDER

With the Wi-Fi wireless Internet access standard becoming a bandwagon
that even big players like AT&T, I.B.M. and Intel are joining,
equipment companies big and small are hoping to ride along. But many
industry analysts say it could be hard to make money in Wi-Fi, which
is unlikely to represent more than a tiny fraction of the overall
telecommunications equipment market for at least several years.

Many of the early leaders in Wi-Fi are obscure companies like Proxim,
Buffalo, Linksys and Dlink. And those that do not sell gear directly
to consumers must rely on selling to Wi-Fi service providers that are
themselves start-ups still trying to find their way, companies like
Boingo Wireless, HereUAre Communications, FatPort and Surf and Sip.
The service providers set up "hot spots" at places like airport
lounges or Starbucks coffee shops, where anyone with a laptop computer
or other device equipped for Wi-Fi can go online.

While analysts hesitate to predict that any of these companies will
survive to become widely recognized brands like Netscape, the
resemblance to the Internet craze of the 1990's has been widely noted.

Subject: Fliers Will Soon Be Able to Go Online on Board


By MATTHEW L. WALD

WASHINGTON - THE Internet, pervasive wherever planes land, is now
penetrating higher altitudes as well. The other ubiquitous
communications tool of travelers, the cellphone, might follow in the
cabin with some technical changes, but not immediately. On Jan. 15
Lufthansa will begin offering Internet connections on a single Boeing
747-400, the latest model, that flies daily between Dulles
International Airport and Frankfurt. It will offer the same service in
its Senator lounges in New York, Frankfurt and Dsseldorf.

The Internet system on the Lufthansa plane uses the most
technologically advanced communications system aloft, satellite
connection, already common on corporate jets. It employs an antenna on
the top of the plane; the type of satellite dish common on the ground
would not be practical, because it would have to be repointed as the
plane moved. The antenna can be steered electronically, and over the
Atlantic it can refocus from one satellite over North America to
another over Europe without interrupting a download, according to
Connexion by Boeing, the Boeing subsidiary that built the system.

Electronic Frontier Foundation Rejects Broadcast Flag
Urges FCC to Stop Hollywood from Dominating Technology

San Francisco - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on Friday 
rejected Hollywood's "Broadcast Flag" proposal, advising the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) to set aside Hollywood's latest bid 
to undermine fair use and stymie innovation.

EFF filed comments with the FCC opposing the Broadcast Flag proposal 
because the proposal would give Hollywood unwarranted control over 
the development of digital television (DTV) and related technologies 
to the detriment of creators and consumers of the technologies.

"A broadcast flag mandate is an ineffective solution to a 
non-existent problem," explained EFF in its comments on the proposed 
rulemaking submitted to the FCC. "At the same time, any broadcast 
flag mandate will impose genuine and substantial costs on consumers 
and innovators. It would raise the cost of DTV devices while reducing 
the value that they represent to consumers. It would stifle 
innovation in DTV and general-purpose technologies. It would abridge 
the First Amendment freedoms of software authors. All of this,in the 
end, will impede, rather than encourage, the transition to DTV."

The Broadcast Flag -- a signal to be added to all DTV broadcasts -- is
a critical weapon in Hollywood's arsenal aimed at strangling
innovation and fair use. In the "Content Protection Status Report,"
the entertainment industry sets out a roadmap for giving entertainment
companies control over the design of general-purpose computers, over
analog-to-digital converters, and over the Internet itself.

The FCC initiated the Broadcast Flag proceedings last summer after
receiving a letter from Senator Ernest "Fritz" Hollings, author of the
Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act (CBDTPA).  The
CBDTPA is a sweeping proposal that would require technologists to seek
permission from entertainment companies prior to making new
technologies available to the public. Industry observers have
described the Broadcast Flag as a "mini-CBDTPA."

EFF has led the effort to educate the public about the Broadcast Flag,
attending every meeting of the Motion Picture Association of America's
Broadcast Protection Discussion Group and popularizing relevant issues
on the "Consensus at Lawyerpoint" weblog.

Subject: Need Canada LD Company; I Need to Call Canada-Only 800 Number
Date: 9 Dec 2002 09:31:15 -0800
Organization: http://groups.google.com/


I'm in the U.S., and I want to be able to dial a Canadian toll-free
number that is only accessible if dialed from within Canada. And
unfortunately the company that I'd like to call doesn't have a
non-toll-free number that I can use instead, so it's the toll-free
number or nothing.

The simplest solution that I can think of is for me to subscribe to a
Canadian long-distance provider that I can use by first calling into
their dial-up access number, and then dialing the number that I want
to reach. As long as the long distance company's switch is a Canadian
area code, my call to the Canadian toll-free number should go through.

So, I'm looking for any long-distance company on whose network my call
would originate from a Canadian area code. I would prefer that this
company's dial-up access numbers themselves also be non-toll-free, but
this is not crucial.

Some companies that provide the long-distance service that I seek
require, unfortunately, that their users also sign-up for residential
long distance from this company, too. But this is something that I'm
not willing to do, even if, by chance, the provider in question
provides residential service in California.

(For an approximation of what kind of service I'm looking for, see
http://www.accuchat.com , which I use within the U.S.)

Another possible solution would be for me to use a Canadian phone card
(of the type that you buy in convenience stores). However, most of
those use toll-free numbers for access and I'd guess that many such
cards generate calls that originate from U.S. area codes, which
wouldn't work. But a Canadian phone card with non-toll-free local
access numbers in a Canadian area code would probably work for me.
And since I'm in California (far from all Canadian convenience
stores), I'd like to be able to have a phone card shipped to me
(unless I can locate a company that, like AccuChat, doesn't need to
put a physical card in my hand to allow me access, but rather performs
direct billing to my credit card).

(It's possible that some of what I wrote above is simply wrong, in
which case please set me straight.)

Anyone have suggestions for me?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: In about 99 percent of the instances of
toll free numbers these days, there is no actual termination of a
phone instrument and wire pair exclusively for 800 service. In most
cases the number *upon which 800 calls are terminated* is a dialable
ten digit number like all other numbers. In a switch somewhere, the
800 number is terminated, and programmed to dial out to the ten digit
number. Your message said the receiver has no other phone service 
'except for the 800 number' and while that could possibly be correct,
as stated above, in about 99 percent of the instances of toll free
numbers these days it is not correct. The switch may look at the 
calling number, and if it is a USA area code then refuse to handle it
further. That seems to be the problem you are having. Won't the
company (or person) involved tell you what the ten-digit number is?
That would be an infinitly better/easier way to deal with your 
problem, by simply dialing the 'real' number instead of trying to
find a company to allow what you are asking. Is this to be a one or
two time call, or is it to be an ongoing thing where the charges to
call the ten digit Canadian number would mount up after awhile?   PAT]

Perhaps we should wait for those parts of America which still don't

"All the bandwidth mobile users will need?" I find that rather 
presumptuous on its face. As far as "all-you-can-eat" prices are 
concerned, when I see the cellular companies EVER offering such a thing, 
I'll believe it.

Odd that no one has corrected this ... it's .kids.us which means it
isn't a "new" TLD but just a 2nd level part of .us

Some other posters made similar comments about ".kids". However, the
current President Bush made a big deal of signing the "dot kids
implementation" legislation last week.

I'm not absolutely sure whether this is actually a ".kids" tld, but it
looks like it.  My hesitancy is from the following comment in the press
release:

	"Dot Kids will be part of the U.S. country domain
	on the Internet."

The rest of the release, as well as the video coverage I saw and the news 
stories I read, make it sound like ".kids" is the tld. So I dunno.

The lack of wireless/landline is more to do with the vastly differing

Subject: Cingular Reveals Incoming Blocked Numbers


Cingular Wireless recently changed the format of their monthly
phone bills.

One of the changes is that the incoming phone number now appears on 
the bill for each incoming call.

This is a nice feature, except that incoming blocked numbers are also 
appearing on the bill. This means that my blocked numbers are 
probably showing up on someone else's Cingular Wireless bill.

Has anyone else here noticed this behavior?

How is the Cingular switch getting access to the blocked incoming
phone number?

Is it legal for them to acquire and then disseminate blocked
phone numbers?

Thanks.

Subject: Satellite is Dishing Out Competition to Cable


CONSUMER BEAT

By Bruce Mohl, 12/8/2002

Furious about AT&T Broadband's plan to hike cable TV rates 7.8 
percent in January, Bert Gay of Jamaica Plain says the company is a 
monopoly run amok.

"I have no other option for cable service other than AT&T," Gay 
said. "Where are the legislators and regulatory watchdogs? I urge 
all AT&T subscribers dissatisfied with this pattern of behavior to 
contact the city of Boston, the state attorney general's office, and 
their own legislators."

What about calling DirecTV?

AT&T may be facing limited competition from RCN Corp. and municipal
cable systems, but satellite operators like DirecTV and Dish Network
are offering consumers a real choice. The satellite companies can't
match AT&T's ability to bundle telecommunication services, but they
have siphoned video-oriented customers away from cable by generally
offering more value, better sound, a better picture, and a much better
track record for holding the line on price increases.

Subject: Wal-Mart Backs Away From DMCA Claim


By Declan McCullagh
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
December 5, 2002, 5:31 PM PT

Wal-Mart said on Thursday that it would not pursue copyright claims 
against a bargain-shopping site that posted details about "Black 
Friday" sales.

In a closely watched move, the mega-retailer invoked the 
controversial Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) last month to 
force FatWallet.com to delete a list of products and prices scheduled 
to appear in Black Friday advertisements. Wal-Mart then sent a 
special DMCA subpoena to FatWallet asking for the identity of the 
person who posted the details on the site. Black Friday is the day 
after Thanksgiving each year when retailers, legend has it, go "in 
the black" and start to make money.

But after a law clinic at the University of California at Berkeley 
stepped in and said it would represent FatWallet and fight the 
subpoena, Wal-Mart backed down.

The U.K. directories issued by British Telecom do not have maps, but
all contain a complete alphabetical list of exchanges along with their
area codes.

Mine happens to be the April 2002 issue for Norwich & North Norfolk,
although the format is the same throughout the country.  Except for
some small cable services in a couple of towns, local loops in this
area are almost exclusively serviced by BT.

The code listings are kept up to date well, and the BT phone books
generally incoporate any upcoming changes, giving the transitional and
mandatory dialing dates when known at publication.

The directories also include a comprehensive list of international
country codes, although they've stopped including selected city/area
codes for overseas calls now.

We have a separate BT-published book available for a small charge
which includes the main alphabetical exchange list and a reverse look
up by area code and prefix.  This one includes selected overseas area
codes.  Although the national section is good, the international part
tends to be rather patchy on details and is sometimes slow to be
updated.  It also contains one or two errors in some cases.

Subject: Mobile Phone Market Rebounding in 2002 - Study


     - Dec 9, 2002 11:27 AM (Reuters)

FRAMINGHAM, Mass., Dec 9 (Reuters) - After suffering from its worst
year ever in 2001, the worldwide mobile phone market is expected to
show a 1.8 percent increase in shipments, to 391 million, in 2002, a
study said on Monday.

    Looking further ahead, shipments are projected to increase to 606
million in 2006, for a compound annual growth rate of 9.5 percent,
according to technology consulting and research firm IDC.

    The study said customers who buy phones to replace old ones will
drive much of that growth, although modest growth will come from
first-time buyers in newer markets like India and China.

Yes, but it's not *American* arrogance in this particular instance. It
is arrogance on the part of the rest of the world. In establishing the
"standards," the CCITT/ITU was openly hostile to anything American.
They intentionally wrote "standards" which ignored American needs, and
then accused the U.S. of being "arrogant." Not so in this case.

The entire history of the CCITT/ITU shows its arrogant hostility
towards the United States. For example, because we had the gall to have
our telephone networks operated by privately held companies instead of
the government-run post office, we weren't even given a vote on many
issues!

Yes, it *IS* easy to discover the correct code, in the U.S. at least.
Every little town that has IDDD (which is 99+% of the country) has a
page in the phone book with instructions on international calling.

No, it isn't "unnecessary," nor is it "expensive," nor is it
"dangerous"!

Changing our four-way stops to traffic circles -- *THAT* would be
unnecessary, expensive, and extremely dangerous!!

If you want a situation that is truly dangerous, take a look at the
traditional traffic circles in France. By law, traffic *entering* the
traffic circle had right-of-way over traffic *in* or *exiting* the
traffic circle. That's a recipe for wrecks and gridlock. France is in
the process of changing to the international standard, that traffic
entering the circle must yield to traffic already in the circle, but
the mess will take years to work out, as each circle has to be
re-signed individually.

For that matter, when is the U.K. going to change over to the
international standard that says that you drive on the right side of
the road? That is a difference that is "unnecessary, expensive, and
dangerous." How many accidents are caused every year by people from
right-drive countries in driving left-drive countries, or vice-versa?

United States, Canada, Bahamas, Jamaica, Bermuda, British Virgin
Islands, Dominican Republic, Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
Montserrat -- 19 countries and separate territories in all. I'd call
that "international," but Europe seems to view it as simply "America."

It would be absurd for the UK to change IDDD codes to 011, due to the
conflict with 0113 through 0119 domestic area codes. You would be able
to dial anywhere in the NANP, Africa, Greenland, Aruba, and the Faeroe
Islands. All other calls would be intercepted with a recording saying
something like, "For Reading, press 1. For China, press 2."

However, it's not exactly sensible to argue that North America should
change to 00 just because of some johnny-come-lately "international
standard."

In any case, if you want to talk about American arrogance in rejecting
a legitimate international standard, let's talk about the Metric
System, especially since we felt a bizarre compulsion to invent our own
fluid ounce and gallon. (One gallon is approximately 3.875 liters, that
being 128 fluid ounces of exactly 29.5735 ml each.) We even have two
versions of the inch for different applications. (By law, the United
States adopted the Metric System over 200 years ago, but common
practice hasn't quite caught up.)

Are all calls to cellular area codes charged at exactly the same rates?
I thought there were differences, in which case, one might get a phone
from the carrier with the lowest cost for calls from a landline to the
mobile, and then switch the service to the carrier with the lowest cost
for outgoing calls from the mobile.

Your caller ID information is sent with every call, unless there is a
glitch in the transmission path resulting in dropped data. Making a
call with caller ID "blocked" just means that a "privacy flag" is set,
indicating that the caller ID data should not be displayed.

When you call a toll-free number, the owner of the number gets to see
it on their monthly bill, even if caller ID was "blocked" on that call.
The rationale is that the toll-free owner is paying for the call, so
they have the right to know what they paid for.

That logic gets a little bit blurry with a cellphone, especially with
things like "unlimited nights and weekends."  However, I doubt that they
did anything outright illegal in releasing that information.

If you're really concerned about it, you could always write to the FCC
and/or to Cingular, suggesting that the bill just show "Private number"
(or some such) on calls with caller ID blocked.

I think that anyone paying for a call (the cellular phone user) has a 
right to know who is running up his bill.

> Has anyone else here noticed this behavior?

No, but now that you mention it, I'll compliment my carrier (Cingular) 
for providing it.

All Caller-ID is transmitted, blocked or not. It has to be for the
other CLASS features to work. If the privacy flag is sent, by
agreement the destination switch shows "private number" or whatever.

> phone numbers?

Yep, as long as they don't display it on the phone. Wireless carriers
operate under a different set of rules than landline carriers. For one
thing, customers pay for all calls, incoming or outgoing.

The calling party's number is always sent with the call. If the
privacy flag is set, it's the end office switch that blocks sending
the CPN to the destination phone.

With a wireless subscriber -- as with an '8YY' ("toll-free") number --
as the call's destination, the called party gets billed for the call,
or a portion of it. In that case, it seems only fair that the calling
party be identified to someone who will be billed for the call.

Maybe a better way for Cingular to handle it would be similar to the
way some switches do anonymous call rejection, giving the calling
party the choice of being rejected or unblocking CPID.

When a private number makes a call, the caller id info is still sent
by the originating switch (along with ani which isn't blocked). The
private number is sent along with a privacy indicator which is what
the terminating switch uses to cause the caller id unit to display
"private." The actual number is held in the incoming line history
block. This is how, for example you can use "customer originated
trace" on a blocked number.

When a private number calls a Cingular cell phone, at the time of the
call, the phone actually says "private." Therefore the Cingular cell
switch is interpreting the privacy indicator correctly.

I noticed this phenomenon over one year ago and battled Cingular for
many months over it. It got me nowhere ... I finally gave up. However,
after some additional time passed it seemed to correct itself and the
private numbers no longer showed up on the detailed bill. Instead,
when a private number called, my OWN cell phone number showed up in
the detailed bill at the date and time of the call rather than the
private number.I haven't checked my itemized calls in a while. I'll
have to make a note to look when I get my next bill to see if it's
happening again.  I wish you great success in attempting to find
someone at Cingular who can not only grasp the concept of this problem
let alone fix it !!!

I think the DMCA is going to inspire a lot of "huff-n-puff" legal
action. The Big Boys will try to intimidate little guys with threats
of legal action (and they may actually file some) hoping for instant
cave-in. The moment a small fry appears to have some legal resources
of his own, the bully will run off.

Patrick,

I finally got a chance to use the telemarketer script that I forwarded
to you a few weeks ago and found that it really works ...
(http://www.xs4all.nl/~egbg/counterscript.html)

I had some poor girl who had just finished year 12 high school ring me
up as a telemarketer ... She had to be 17 or 18. Her name name was
Jordie (Yes, that is the right spelling), who has been working as a
telemarketer for some Melbourne company for one week -- and will be
going overseas in a week before starting university. 

She got my number from the white pages.  This one was definitely too
trusting and was going to give me her home phone number in
Melbourne ... The only reason she didn't was that I didn't have the
full script with me, and she hung up on me when I refused to answer
her questions if she gave me her number. I could tell that she did
actually want to give me her number.

I almost felt guilty after that... But it was fun.

Reply-To: joey@lairdsflooring.com


We've had lots of discussions here about the joys of telemarketing ...
about getting that phone call in the middle of dinner, telling you how
you are a man of distinction and fine taste, and would you therefore
like to buy some grotty wallet?  (with apologies to Douglas Adams.)

I got a call last week from someone representing the CIBC, or Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, of which I am already a customer: a
chequing account, a Visa, and an "Entourage" American Express card. I
was in the middle of a long distance call at the time and ... well,
the call quickly degenerated into an actual shouting match, something
I'd never experienced before with a telemarketer. I'll now paste in
the entire email that I sent to CIBC Customer Service immediately
after the call.  Boy, it felt good to write it.  :-)

(Certain private information is redacted).

==========

I am a CIBC customer, both chequing and two credit cards (Visa,
Entourage).  My name is Joey Lindstrom, and my telephone number is
403-XXX-XXXX.  (More info to verify my identify at the end of this
message) <redacted>

About 5 minutes ago (7:45pm MST, Tuesday December 3rd 2002), I
received a phone call from a girl who identified herself as
representing CIBC.  She wanted to inform me of some new free credit
card benefit, since I was such a good customer.

I value my privacy.  Before letting her start her pitch, I attempted
to stop her by saying that I do not accept telemarketing calls.

I sure hope you recorded this call, because her reaction was quite
amazing.  She actually began arguing with me, raising her voice.  I
tried FOUR TIMES to say "please add my number to your DO NOT CALL
list", and she interrupted each time.  Finally, after much arguing
(about whether or not this was a telemarketing call - she actually
told me I was jumping to conclusions), I managed to get those ten
words out uninterrupted.  She practically spit it back at me, saying
"well!  Then you should have said 'no' when you filled out..." and I
didn't catch the rest of her sentence because I hung up on her.

This is unacceptable.  This woman was rude and VERY aggressive towards
me.  I happen to have been on a long distance call when she
interrupted me with her call.  She - and therefore CIBC - has no right
at all to my personal time, in my home and on my phone line.  I have a
right to privacy and I have a (CRTC-guaranteed) right to be placed on
your "Do Not Call" list upon request - a request she did her best to
thwart (and I'm convinced she has not honoured that request).

Yes, I'm a "good customer".  I've got $13,500 worth of credit on my
CIBC credit cards so obviously you must agree with that assessment.

But I'm telling you now that I am going to change from "good customer"
to "former customer" unless I get some satisfaction here.  And to get
that satisfaction, you need to do the following:

1) Assure me that you will never again attempt to contact me by
telephone unless it is in order to straighten out some problem with
one of my accounts (ie: payment overdue, suspected fraud, overdrawn,
things of that nature).  I DO NOT WANT any telemarketing calls.  Ever.
Don't put me on a list that expires in three years.  "Ever" is what I
mean.  And let's not split hairs: offering me a "free benefit" is
still telemarketing.  Don't agree?  Ask the CRTC.  Regardless, *I*
consider it telemarketing and I don't want those calls from you
anymore.  If you want to offer me any more "free benefits", stick the
offer in my statement envelope as usual.

2) Review this incident with the girl who placed the call to me.  Her
behaviour was ridiculous and put you in a very bad light.  Inform me
of what action, if any, is taken.

Your response will help me decide whether or not to keep my CIBC
accounts.

=====

I didn't really expect any kind of positive response other than "oh,
we're so sorry, we'll make sure it never happens again".  I just
figured that the more negative feedback that a "reputable" company
like the CIBC gets in regards to telemarketing, the better -- maybe
one day they'll realize just how offensive people find it, and it'll
convince them to change their ways.

I did get a pretty good response, which I present for your enjoyment
and/or amusement.  With any luck, I've cost this girl her job.

(Note the 11-digit phone number she gives for the CMA.  When did we
switch to 8-digit local dialing?)

Subject: Court Rules Internet Case Can be Heard in Australia


     - Dec 9, 2002 09:07 PM (Reuters)

CANBERRA, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Australia's highest court ruled on
Tuesday that a defamation case sparked by a story on a U.S Web site
could be heard in Australia, opening a legal minefield for web
publishers over which libel laws they must follow.

    The landmark ruling that an article published by Dow Jones & Co
(NYSE:DJ) was subject to Australian law -- because it was downloaded
in Australia -- is being watched by media firms as it could set a
precedent over where Internet publication occurs.

Good point Owain.

I know that when I was in Georgia a few years ago that many rural
counties in the state didn't have 911.

How much of America is still waiting for 911 service these days?

Interestingly, there is no mention in the article of IrDA, which was
the original medium for the "Connexion" between your laptop and the
aircraft.

Instead, it looks like wired ethernet.  Harumph.  I saw a Boeing
mockup at the Paris air show; there was an IR transceiver staring down
on the tray table, which made perfect sense, as practically every
laptop has IrDA capability (though it is almost always disabled by
default).

Actually there is a good reason for this practice: most of the cost of
providing telephone service is physical plant, whose size is
determined by peak usage.  Peak usage occurs during the business day
and consists almost entirely of calls to or from businesses.  Thus
both weekday daytime calls and business lines have always cost more,
to pay for the new facilities they make necessary.  It's not a "soak
the rich" scheme.

Correct, except that if you track the specific charges for which your
home business is responsible, you can deduct those charges.  Typically
only long distance calls are deducted this way if the line is used for
other things.  (I'm a tax professional in my other life.)

SBC/Pacific Bell.

I'd give this map a C-.  Most of the codes for the western US are
shown correctly, however the boundaries are very sloppily drawn, so
there's no way to determine the code for a particular town near a
boundary.  The map doesn't cover the northern 2/3 of Canada, so 780
and 867 don't exist on it (nor does BC's recent overlay).  And for the
eastern US, several states are broken out as insets but it doesn't
make them any more readable.

They include a separate map showing California's LATAs which is
somewhat more accurate; the boundaries aren't quite as sloppy, and it
correctly says what area codes are in each LATA (except possibly the
case of Dixon).  But it doesn't make clear that the high-desert
(Verizon) LATA exists.

I'd rate both maps about equal to the ones on areacode-info.com.  AC-I
draws the boundaries better, but it also shows lots of area codes that
don't exist and may never exist.  SBC at least avoids doing that.

That is an interesting question, and I would like to know if its
answer is documented somewhere.  I suggest that you put it to the fine
people at ETSI.org.  They have been very helpful to me in the past.
If you do then please let us know what they say.

I would suggest that you clarify what your interest in MAP is.  What
role do you play in the network?  What does "v3" mean to you?  That
might make answering your question easier.

You might start by obtaining a copy of the GSM MAP specification to
which you are considering an upgrade.  For example, ETSI document
ts_100974v070900p.pdf contains ETSI TS 100 974 V7.9.0 (2001-09)
Technical Specification Digital cellular telecommunications system
(Phase 2+); Mobile Application Part (MAP) Specification (3GPP TS 09.02
version 7.9.0 Release 1998).

Annex E Change History, at the end of the document, might provide you 
with some insight into the functional improvements that were made.  For 
example, "s26 98-0413 09.02 6.0.0 A124 R97 F SMS interworking with GPRS 
6.1.0" and "s26 98-0413 09.02 6.0.0 A124 2 R97 C Modification of Insert 
Subscriber Data and Delete Subscriber Data Procedures for GPRS 6.1.0"

O.K., it might make for some slip-ups, especially when someone has
just stepped off the plane after a long, tiring flight, but I guess I
just don't see the different IDDD prefixes as really being *that* much
of a problem.

U.S. = 011
Australia = 0011
U.K. = 010 (now 00)

I concede on that point.  If the IDDD code isn't shown, somebody might
be left with calling the local operator as the only way to find out.
That wouldn't be a problem between countries sharing a language and
where the number to dial for an operator is either obvious or clearly
posted (e.g.  U.S.A. & U.K.), but might be much more of a problem in
other cases.  This is clearly an instance where it pays to make
inquiries *before* leaving home, although one can never cater for
everything, of course.

True ...  As American road markings and signage are far superior to
those in the U.K./Europe (and probably elsewhere too), I think this is
a case where the "rest of the world" would do well to adopt
U.S. standards and practices.  But that's another story, and I know of
a least some fellow Brits who would disagree with me.

Possibly not enshrined in ITU standards (I don't know), but an
accepted standard in practically all countries within the NANP:
U.S.A., Canada, Bermuda, Bahamas, Dominica, Virgin Islands (U.S. *and*
British), Dominican Republic, etc.

I think that's the root of the problem. Adopting any sort of common
standard means that somebody, somewhere has to change.  It's a case of
whether the cost and upheaval of the changes is worth it for the
proposed advantages of adopting a common standard.  It also depends on
how efficiently changes can be carried out: I submit the fiasco over
the number changes in London as an excellent example of how *not* to
do it!

As an aside, in the U.K. it would have been possible to adopt 011 as
in IDDD prefix without any great difficulty had it been implemented a
few years ago.  Now that we have area codes of the form 011n, it would
be much harder, of course.

Subject: Greetings and a Question


Hi Patrick,

It's been a long long time.  My fault, just been so busy the past few
years that I faded away from the Digest.  I suppose I should start
reading again.  I've gone from networks back to telecom manager for
about 40 offices in my company.  Hope you're doing well.  My question
involves a personal matter.

Recently my girlfriend received a message on her answering machine
from an unknown caller (the caller ID said private, indicating the
caller did a *67).  The caller said she had been sleeping with me.  My
girlfriend and I have had some drama in our lives lately and she knew
better.  The telephone company says there's nothing they can do and
that they can't trace calls like this.  The police department said that
since there was no threat or harassment that they couldn't get
involved.  My dusty knowledge from years back makes me think that this
is a crime and a federal matter.  Just wondering if there's anything
you think we can do.  I promise, no more questions like this.  It's
just that with your broad knowledge base, I thought you might have a
helpful suggestion.  Take care of yourself and I promise I'm going to
start reading again.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: If the calling party had attempted to
make a business arrangement out of it (i.e. you pay me X dollars, or 
do X activity, otherwise I will relate this to your girl friend) that
would have been a crime. If a reasonable person thought this was the
implication, it might have been a crime as well. If the calling party
was attempting to disrupt or wreak havoc on your domestic life, this
might also have been a crime. Maybe an attorney midst our ranks can 
comment further. Telco is trying very hard to stay out of these things
in recent years, by offering services such as privacy manager and 
'blocked number blocking' (the extent to which those services work as
well as they should/could is open to much debate) so that the recipient
of such calls has recourse to the caller,  for filing suit or otherwise
demanding some accountability. From reading your message, I take it
the caller did 'nothing' other than make a rather rude, obscene phone 
call to your girl friend. Probably still a crime, but ... 

 ... in view of the fact that police right now are attempting to find
ways to circumvent Posse Comitatus (federal laws against it) in order
to legally get the military involved in south-central Los Angeles
which this past week exceeded Washington, DC as our Nation's murder
and drug Capitol of the World, I think it is rather unrealistic to
expect them to be of much help. I wish I had an 'in-house' criminal
attorney here to whom questions like yours could be posed. Maybe one
will answer anyway. I for one am *sorry* to think this  incident may
have harmed your personal life.  :(  What you might start by doing is
having girl friend give you a tape of the message if such exists, and
you listen to it over and over; see if any clues can be found in the
voice patterns, the disconnect at the end of it, etc. Any 'special'
words, or phraseology or accents, etc.  PAT]

Subject: An Example of a Cycle Gobbler: cidaemon.exe
Organization: Ixian Systems, Inc.


Late Monday night I had a bit of commotion here. The Windows XP
computer got very slow and sluggish, then eventually came to a 
complete halt. All the programs said 'not responding'. I would
restart/reboot, get a couple minutes of work (sometimes not even
that much) and the problem would occur again; everything would 
get quite slow, then grint to a halt. I was pretty sure I had
a bunch of unwanted processes running in the background. My west
coast friend helped walk me through it, and indeed we found that
was the case. It had gotten so bad that even the three-fingered
solution (control-alt-delete) would not respond without taking a
minute or two to do so. My friend found that by doing 'taskmgr'
at the 'run' prompt, (which did grudginly work after a minute or
so of stalling) something called 'cidaemon.exe' was taking up a
huge amount of CPU. We found out it was set to run automatically
and was gobbling all the cycles it could find. Using the System
Administration feature in 'my computer' we were able to shut it
off and only run on request. It took Windows a few seconds to shut
it down also, but once it was off, the computer went back to
its normal speed. 

He then wrote the following note for the net, anyone who has this
kind of slowdown problem might find it useful.

Hello,

We just got a new IP Office 406 system in our office in San Jose,
CA. I'm in IT and will help manage the system. We have complete
support from a local VAR for one year, however this is the first
implementation for IP Office so they are learning, too.

So far our major issues are:

1) Dial-by-name directory not delivered from Avaya. Our VAR said Avaya
said maybe next week it will be ready.

2) Programming DSS buttons crashes the system. Our VAR said Avaya said
this is a known problem and they are working on it. What we are trying
to accomplish is, for example, I want to be able to answer the phone
of my assistants extension and I want it to actually ring on my phone.
On our old NEC system it was an appearance light on the phone.  Our
VAR said I had to use DSS, but 1) the phone does not actually ring -
the line only flashes, and 2) it crashes the system, or actually the
digital card, the VAR said.

3) We have to reboot the system when we want to add extensions and
update other settings. So far, the "Merge" option has not worked for
us.

4) The 4412D+ handsets are nice but they do not fit well into the
cradle, and sometimes leave the phone off-hook!

We have 3 30-port D-term modules and two analog modules. We also have
Voicemail Pro with Phone Manager Lite.

If there is other information I can provide please let me know.  If
there is another forum or website I should also be looking at, I'd
appreciate that information, too.

Thanks again,

*TOM

I read an article that made it sound like Bush got fed up with ICAAN

Today, SBC announced that it is tossing the name "Pacific Bell" and
"PacBell". Anyone with a pulse could see this coming, but what is
annoying is the SBC perpetuation of the myth of "branding".

Brands used to mean something. Companies were founded, they created
products, and they identified them as unique with brand names. Today,
as a general rule, products are created and manufactured in nameless,
faceless foreign labs and factories and sold in bulk to a marketing
company, which puts its brand on it.

This shows up all the time. My sister was amused that she bought a
washer and a dryer from two ostensibly unrelated companies. Imagine
her surprise (and delight, actually) to discover that they matched
perfectly. In fact, were it not for the different brand names, one
would instantly presume that they were purchased as a matched set.

Drive up the San Francisco peninsula sometime and you will see dozens
of hotels near the airport. Then drive up two months later, and you
will discover that the names of the hotels have been shuffled, as if
the signs had magnetic backings and could changed like refrigerator
magnets.  What on earth could a brand name mean if next month the
Crowne Plaza hotel sports a Sheraton logo?

Brand names today are meaningless. Marketing types may think that the
public puts stock in brands, but more and more people are waking up to
the insignificance of brand names. When SBC runs a spot that talks
about how it built the local telephone network, we all laugh. The
network was built by the old AT&T, and then modernized by a California
company, Pacific Telesis. SBC simply handed over cash for a going
business. It built nothing. I do not credit Texans for doing anything
in California, unless it would be for our current state budget deficit
after cleaning our clock with energy scams.

Pacific Bell, when it was owned by Pacific Telesis, a California
company based right here in San Francisco, built the new Giants
stadium with private money. As the major contributor, the company
properly named the facility "PacBell Park".

The name of the park is about to be changed to "SBC Park" (how
catchy!).  San Francisco loses yet another bit of history and landmark
identification; SBC perpetuates its worthless and meaningless
"national brand name".

Even a spokeperson for SBC admitted on the radio today that "SBC",
since the spinoff of Southwestern Bell Corporation, does not actually
stand for anything. It is simply the stock exchange symbol.

All we do in this country anymore is shuffle money.

The DMCA has provisions specifically to discourage this type of behavior,
does it not?

It *appears* that Wal Mart may have acted in haste, and that FatWallet
could -- I say could -- have quite a fine time throwing these
anti-frivolous provisions of the DMCA right back at Wal Mart.

And given Wal Marts very large pockets and visibility in the retailing
industry, FatWallet could end up very rich AND very famous for nipping
that particular problem right in the bud.

To discover it: yes, easy ... to implement it: can be more difficult.

Particularly when dealing with auto-dialling equipment.  Look at the
efforts that Microsoft had to put into getting accurate dialing-rule
tables loaded into the more recent versions of its "Windows" products!

Understandable, only if you consider the wild mishmash of
international prefix codes that USED to prevail across the world.  A
consensus did emerge, and many countries - EVEN INCLUDING the UK! -
agreed to throw away their proprietary prefixes and implement the
proposed standard prefix.  Only a few countries disagreed.  The 19
countries that Linc listed comprised most of them.

Well, when 00 was proposed, the UK had many (both "internal" and E.164)
codes that began with "00": such as 0066 for chatlines, 0073 for Paging,
0092 for Oxford, 0073 for Orpington, 0042 for Ogmore Valley and 0001 for
Dublin.  We had to change all those: and, as always happens, it takes
time to change and "sterilise" the old ranges ("sterilise" is the word
we phone-numbering people use for curing callers of their habits of
calling their regular numbers as they were before the changeover ;-))

Now to nit-pick ... there is no problem in the UK with Reading, as ALL
numbers in Reading are in the formats (0)118 3xx xxxx/(0)118 9nx xxxx
(where n#9) so as, according to WTNG - +83 and +89 are "Unassigned",
there cannot possibly be any conflict.  I would have thought that Linc
(of all people) would have known that, and so would have chosen a more
appropriate example to quote - such as Leeds/Belgium (0113-2);-))

Also, there has never been a UK number range 0119, nor is there any
scope to create one under what passes for UK current numbering policy!

But there is one overriding reason for having standardisation and that
is the increasing use of the Internet.  Web pages more commonly show
people complete numbers to dial, and for that they have to include the
international prefix.  In other words, it is more important for people
to be able to GIVE their OWN numbers in a format that can be dialled
universally, than to avoid changing formats when you (physcially)
visit a different country.

A "good" example of this occurred a few years ago - the time when the
dial-a-porn trade was advertising phoney phone numbers which suggested
that calls would route to Guyana (the callers were certainly CHARGED
at the rate for calls to Guyana).  In most cases the people running
the scam expected their calls to come from the USA, and so numbers
were advertised on the webpages in the form "011 592 5xxxxx" - which
was, to say the least, unhelpful for callers outside the NANPA.

People in the UK saw webpages with these numbers, and started calling
the numbers exactly as shown -- unaware that this was not exactly the
providers' intention -- and so a small block of phone numbers serving
the Beeston area of Nottingham started to receive some very odd phone
calls ... at even odder hours of the day -- and night!

Linc,

It's not just the ITU/CCITT that shows hostility toward America
either.  I'm afraid that many institutions in this part of the world
somehow seem to feel that it is their right, maybe even their duty, to
show the "arrogant Americans" the error of their ways and put them on
the right road toward adopting "world" standards.  (What they really
mean is "European standards" or course -- Not the same thing.)  The
fact that whatever it is has been working quite satisfactorily in the
U.S. for decades and that Americans see no need to change doesn't seem
to occur to them.

> Changing our four-way stops to traffic circles -- *THAT* would be

Well said, Sir!  I've never understood the British passion here for
installing traffic circles ("roundabouts") all over the place.  We
have big ones, small ones, some that are just a small bump in the
road, and some stretches of road where there is one of these tortuous
systems every 200 yards or so.  Totally unnecessary, and one of things
that makes driving in the States a pleasure.

They seem to have just about finished now.  Last time I was there I
saw none of the old-style circles.  To emphasize the priority rules,
all the new junctions have yield signs at each road, reinforced by
"Vous n'avez pas la priorite" signs below.  But you still find places
in towns where traffic emerging from a tiny side alley on your right
has priority, even though you are on a main thoroughfare.

The U.S. gallon is actually the old British gallon from several
centuries ago (I forget the exact date).  I believe one of our distant
monarchs decreed that the new Imperial gallon (4.546 liters) should
become accepted measurement in England (something to do with measuring
wine, IIRC) and it has been so firmly established ever since that most
Brits assume that the U.S gallon was of American origin (in the same
way as they regard terms such as "gotten" as being American
"corruptions", when in fact it was in Britain in which they fell out
of use).

When I'm away from home, I never direct dial long distance calls.  I
always use some kind of calling card.

In North America, that means that I call an 800 number to get to the
calling card system.  Other places, it invariably means that I call
some country-specific code, usually an 0800 number or something like
that.  Except in the rare cases where I'm using a local phone card to
make the call (which I think I did once or twice in France), the
international dialing prefix is irrelevant.

Subject: Cell Socket
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2002 17:11:47 -0500


I saw you talking about cell socket on the news groups and I have a
couple of questions.  One is that I bought one because it creates a
dial tone.  I wanted to be able to order movies off my Dish TV box
with it. Won't do that.  Also will make my plain phone ring but not my
portable phone.  Do you know why?  

Thanks, Carol

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Part of that is *intended* behavior. 
The Cell Socket (which Mike Sandman does *NOT* sell [he had planned
on it but decided against it, not liking the company's terms]) is 
intended to allow the use of a 'regular' land line telephone in place
of the cellular phone, while keeping the cellular phone charged and
ready to go. It does not very well pass along tone signals to do other
jobs, such as bank-by-phone, etc. With much patience it can be done
sometimes. Usually the voicemail thing at the other end (DISH movie
order lines, etc) times out before you can get Cell Socket to obey.

I have gotten Cell Socket to pass through modem tones for a computer,
but v-e-r-y slowly ... how's 110 or 300 baud sound? :(  You can do
computers with cellular phones or DISH or bank-by-phone with cellular
(but using an actual cellular phone and its keypad). For computers,
you seem to need a PCMCIA 'slot' on the computer with a specially
built PCMCIA card to go in it, (the usual little credit card type
thing, with a tiny antenna on the end which looks off into space and
finds a cell tower it talks to. Even that only gets you real slow
service (like 19.2 or with luck, 33.8 and cut offs now and then and
computer freeze ups), but it will work. Cell Socket on the other 
hand won't work with any of those things. (I had tried just plugging
a modular cord from a modem into the Cell Socket, letting the modem
listen to the dial tone and proceed from there. That sometimes got me
the 110 baud I mentioned). 

What the Cell Socket WILL do: Basically it acts like a 'handsfree' car
adapter; it keeps the cell phone battery charged, let's you plug a
'real' telephone into it, (or a headset, or a speaker phone, or ??)
and make calls at your leisure sitting elsehwere and not having to
hold the cellular phone to your ear. In fact, when you pop the Nokia
5100 series phone in the Cell Socket, the phone display changes to
say 'handsfree mode', and you see the battery charge icon shooting up
and down as the battery charges. If you let the phone plug into the
external antenna on the Cell Socket, you do get better coverage range
and better 'sounding' conversation. Very smart guys have learned how
to adapt Cell Socket to work as an 'external line' on a PBX; for 
example, where '9' gets you an outside line, '7' or '8' gets you the
dialtone from the cell socket for example. Now wherever you have an
extension on your PBX you can use the cell phone via Cell Socket. 

What else the Cell Socket WILL do:  Any benefits you would get from
using your cell phone are available to you. No one uses all of those
three thousand minutes of overnight use. Very few people get totally
free long distance (as most cell phones give). Most people are not in
a position to sit hanging out their window with the phone angled a
certain way to get decent reception. With Cell Socket and an external
5/8 wave antenna and three radials on it (Mike DOES sell the antenna
for the 5100 series Nokia phones; [ http://www.sandman.com ]) you set
the antenna in the best spot; then use the landline phone by your
comfortable chair to make calls. Cell Socket does make dialtone, to
guide you in making your outgoing call seem 'more natural' as you 
found out. (Cellphones are about the only type of telecommunication
device for phone calls which does NOT 'make dialtone' normally.) You
also noted that using Cell Socket, the new external phone does the
ringing, instead of the cellphone. Personally, to me that is sort
of a classy feature, especially if the phone you are using has a 'side
ringer' which outputs a neat audible, like for example the old-style
chimes that Bell System used twenty or thirty years ago. Where my
Cell Socket sits with the antenna (in my bedroom) I cannot hear the
cellphone itself ringing in my computer area. I *can* hear the bell
on the phone I use instead. To each his own, I guess. I do not like
to watch DISH pay per view movies (rip offs!) but I do like having 
my long distance bill being almost zero each month. Its too bad Mike's
supplier of the Cell Socket had to be so cheap and difficult for Mike
to work with.   PAT]

Subject: PluggedIn: Holiday Deadlines Loom for Deal on Cell Phones


By Yukari Iwatani

    CHICAGO, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Consumers in the market for a new cell
phone may want to size up special holiday offers before many of them
expire in the new year.

    This holiday season new phones, more minutes and more features,
such as color screens, games and ring tones, are selling at prices not
available six months ago.

    Consumers are also benefiting from increased competition in the
wireless industry as companies vie to sign up new clients amid an
industrywide slowdown in customer growth.

    Wireless operators are hoping they can jump-start demand for
fancier phones and new types of services by offering discounts to
create buzz among consumers who tend to choose phones according to
basic calling features and pricing.

    The deals may be enticing -- even for those who are not in the
market for a new phone.

Subject: Wired News: Kiddie Cell Phones: Hot New Toy?


By Elisa Batista
02:00 AM Dec. 10, 2002 PT

Dear Santa: Forget Mattel, and bring on Nokia.

As some parents already know, the hot item on many 8- to 12-year-olds'
wish lists this holiday season isn't Barbie or a Hot Wheels car, but a
cell phone.

If a child in this age group doesn't already own a cell phone -- 21
percent of them do, according to research by SpectraCom -- he or she
is likely part of the great majority pestering mom and dad for one.

As Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist, put it: "Board 
games have become bored games for kids.

Apple's QuickTime is poised to make headway as an audio and video
delivery platform for mobile phones in Japan, with new
standards-compatible software on its way and a fresh endorsement by
leading wireless carrier NTT DoCoMo.

In coming weeks, Apple will introduce a new version of its multimedia
delivery system, QuickTime 6, with support for 3GPP, or 3rd Generation
Partnership Project--telecommunications standards for mobile
systems. 3GPP is built on the MPEG-4 standard for the delivery of
digital audio and video to PCs, set-top boxes and wireless devices.

Subject: Raided Firm's Software Checks Out


By Michelle Delio
02:00 AM Dec. 10, 2002 PT

Software designed by Ptech, a Massachusetts technology firm U.S. 
federal agents suspect might be linked to terrorist groups, does not 
appear to threaten national security.

Federal agents raided the company's Quincy offices early Friday 
morning. Officials are investigating allegations that investors in 
the company also finance terrorist organizations.

News of the raid sparked concerns that Ptech's software could have 
been engineered to allow attackers access to classified 
national-security data. The Army and Air Force, Congress, the White 
House, the Federal Aviation Administration and the FBI use the 
company's knowledge-management software.

Initial reports indicate that Ptech's software was not engineered to 
allow attackers easy access to government databases.

But security experts warned that while Ptech products might be safe, 
the raids highlight the need to secure systems from internal as well 
as external threats.

New Tools for Domestic Spying, and Qualms
By MICHAEL MOSS and FORD FESSENDEN

When the Federal Bureau of Investigation grew concerned this spring
that terrorists might attack using scuba gear, it set out to identify
every person who had taken diving lessons in the previous three years.

Hundreds of dive shops and organizations gladly turned over their
records, giving agents contact information for several million people.

"It certainly made sense to help them out," said Alison Matherly, 
marketing manager for the National Association of Underwater 
Instructors Worldwide. "We're all in this together."

But just as the effort was wrapping up in July, the F.B.I. ran into a
two-man revolt. The owners of the Reef Seekers Dive Company in Beverly
Hills, Calif., balked at turning over the records of their clients,
who include Tom Cruise and Tommy Lee Jones -- even when officials came
back with a subpoena asking for "any and all documents and other
records relating to all noncertified divers and referrals from July 1,
1999, through July 16, 2002."

Faced with defending the request before a judge, the prosecutor
handling the matter notified Reef Seekers' lawyer that he was
withdrawing the subpoena. The company's records stayed put.

Subject: Door Opens For Second News Corp DirecTV Bid


By Sophie Hares

    SYDNEY, Dec 11 (Reuters) - After a year on the sidelines,
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp Ltd is tipped to make a second tilt
at Hughes Electronics Corp's (NYSE:GMH) DirecTV and finally grab
the missing piece of its global satellite empire.

    With few rivals wielding the financial clout to throw up fresh
offers after the collapse of EchoStar Communication Corp's
(NASDAQ:DISH) $18 billion bid, News Corp could bide its time to hammer
out a deal from Hughes' parent General Motors Corp (NYSE:GM).  But
funding any deal for control of the top U.S. satellite TV service
without jeopardizing its credit ratings is likely to be a major
challenge for News Corp, said analysts on Wednesday.

Internet Filters Block Many Useful Sites, Study Finds
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

Teenagers who look to the Internet for health information as part of
their "wired generation" birthright are blocked from many useful sites
by antipornography filters that federal law requires in school and
library computers, a new study has found.

The filtering programs tend to block references to sex and sex-related
terms, like "safe sex," "condoms," "abortion," "jock itch," "gay" and
"lesbian." Although the software can be adjusted to allow access to
most health-related Web sites, many schools and libraries ratchet up
the software's barriers to highest settings, the report said.

What is it about Call Waiting that seems to trap people into interrupting
EVERY CALL to deal with that other person??!!!!

Can't you punch a key or something to cause the Call Waiting beeps to
stop and give the caller a busy signal so it would let you go on with
your long-distance calls uninterrupted?

I've been on the paying end of long-distance calls, and INVARIABLY if
that other call beep comes in I get the "Oh, there's another call
coming in.  I'll be right back."

I've even been on the non-paying end of the long-distance call, and
the same thing happens.  The caller, paying for the minutes I am on
hold, is so trapped by that Call Waiting feature they seem to have no
choice!

If a call, even a local call is so important to you and you don't want
to interrupt it, then DON'T answer the other call if you have Call
Waiting!

If your phone company provides a way to turn OFF Call Waiting while
you are ON a call, then use it when you are on an important call.

I agree with Joey that the bank's telemarketer did not handle this
call well at all.  Any sales person should know not to argue with a
customer.

I suspect that the bank's sales caller does not actually work for the
bank but more likely works for some contractor that the bank has hired
to make marketing calls.  I think a real bank sales person would not
have let things deteriorate so quickly.  S/He could have offered to
call again at a more convenient time or offered to send information in
the mail about the offer.  That's what our local KeyBank people do.

On the other hand, I think Joey should have said to her politely and
firmly that he was on another "important" call at the moment and not
mentioned the "no call" request at that moment.  The idea is to
disconnect from the sales rep *as soon as possible* and GET BACK to
your interrupted call.

AFTER you are done with your long-distance call or important call,
*then* you can contact your bank and talk to your own branch
representative or manager and tell them what you need.  It might
involve adding a "Do Not Call" request to your information.

Remember, too, that there are scammers out there who pretend to be
from your bank or phone company but really are not.  So I would not
want to get mad at the bank or my phone company if they are victims of
a scam along with me.

I've NEVER had Call Waiting and don't miss it AT ALL!

I hope Joey has not done too much damage to his reputation by sending
off that angry e-mail!  I think he would have been better off to talk
to a local bank manager or representative that he KNOWS actually works
for the bank and tell them what happened.  Then he can ask who in
authority at the bank he can write to (on paper with his own
signature) to tell what happened and ask for the change in the
call/no-call request.

E-mail is not very secure.  Giving out too much personal information
in e-mail is risky.  That's why I think sending a paper letter would
be better.

I agree with Joey about wanting to be called about problems with my
current accounts, questions about possible fraud, etc.  But I might
not want to be called about yet another credit card.

Let's get some good ideas going about how to handle Call Waiting.

If a person pays for Call Waiting, then how about also having "Voice
mail" at the phone company that will pick up the call if the beep is
ignored.

Let's stop being prisoners of that Call Waiting beep!

Gail in Ohio USA


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Oftentimes, call waiting can be
suspended by using *70 at the start of your outgoing call, or on 
incoming calls by doing flashhook *70 in mid-call. If you wait until
a call waiting signal *then* do flashhook the result will be you then
get the new call. So do it early on on incoming calls, as soon as you
detect the call is important and you do not want another call to be
dumped on you.

Voicemail is NOT available on 620-331 for whatever reason, but I
cheat a little, by having it on my cell phone (620-330) along with
'transfer on busy/no answer' on my main number. So if I either do
*70 or forget to do that and let my phone continue ringing with a call
waiting, in any event after three rings the call will be transferred
to my cell phone for four or five more rings, then off to voicemail on
the cell phone. My cell phone also has call-waiting, which may be a
bit of an overkill for me, but the same thing happens there if I do
not take an incoming call after four or five rings; off to voicemail. 
There is also a thing called 'distinctive ring call-waiting' which is
a short double beep-beein instead of the usual 'longer' beep. 

I agree with Gail that Joey *should have* handled the call differently
but some telemarketers are so ignorant the only thing they understand
is a rough bark. I had some calls a couple days ago like that. The
calls tripped the privacy manager condition, and 'pressing 1' to hear
the callers name got me some telemarketer's name and number. I chose
to respond by 'pressing 3' to have a pre-recorded message delivered to
the caller saying 'I do not take telemarketing calls, please remove
this number from your list'. I then hang up, and within about one
minute more or less the phone rang again. It was Privacy Manager
calling again, with the same person this time recording their 'name'
as 'I am not selling anything'. I figured what the heck, let's see
what the lady is doing if not selling anything. It turned out she
was 'taking a survey of long distance carriers' and offering a free
month of her carrier. After damning her to hell I slammed the phone
down again. I have to admit for all its shortcomings, Privacy Manager
does help a little. Instead of getting several calls each day now I
only get one or two per week.  PAT]

you list it in the yellow pages or advertise it in anyway (billboard,

Dunno, but if they have any kind of electronic switching, I'd bet that
911 calls go straight through to the LEC operator, who should know how
to transfer them to police, fire or EMS services.  I found that that
was the case when my neighborhood was cut over to a 1A ESS twenty
years ago, several years before 911 came in.

Not bad overall, but this bull from large businesses that it'll take
months to remove you is ridiculous. I'd follow up with a letter that
says "thanks for attempting to expedite my removal, but X weeks is
plenty, and any calls received after X weeks will generate complaints
to the CRTC." Where X is a number of your choosing - I'd say 2-4 would
be reasonable. Actually, 1-2 should be enough.

If that's truly what the study claimed, and the numbers are limited to
the United States only, then it is certainly a crock of nonsense.  The
*total* number of annual road deaths in the US last year was around
42,000, a level which has held at roughly the same level for quite a
few years.  Of course, the population rises every year, so the true
figure of interest is the number of deaths per distance driven.  This
number has been slowly but steadily falling for many years, and is now
at a level of (IIRC) ~1.5 fatalities per 100 million vehicle miles
traveled.  Curiously, this is almost exactly the same rate as found in
the United Kingdom, which I understand has laws banning the use of
handheld mobiles while driving.

So if the skyrocketing use of mobile phones in general, and handheld
mobiles in particular, has really added a significant level of danger
to driving the in the US, then one would expect to see a noticeable
trend in the road death statistics.  And yet we don't seem to see such
a trend.  To those who point out that road and cars are safer now
than they were a decade ago, I agree -- but so what?  The same could be
said in 1992 with respect to the road and cars of 1982.  The secular
trend of the curve in the fatality rate graph is still not noticeably
different than it was back then.  (Of course, the rate of decline is
still itself declining, as the overall death rate approaches, but will
never reach, zero.)

Anecdotally, a lot of people (including various national and state
legislatures) seem to feel the same way.  Surprisingly, however, the
first major study of mobile phone usage while driving, conducted
several years ago by the University of Toronto, actually found *no
difference* between the accident rates of hands-free and hand-held
users!

OVERVIEW

The .US top-level domain (usTLD) was established in 1985 as the
official country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for the United
States. It is administered by NeuStar.  The expanded second-level .US
domain launched on April 24, 2002, enabling companies, nonprofits,
government entities and individuals to establish unique, memorable
American addresses online.

STRUCTURE

The existing .US structure is a locality-based hierarchy modeled on
the geography of the United States. Most usTLD branches in the
locality space are overseen by delegated managers (also known as
"delegees" or "locality delegees").  This existing hierarchical design
provides structure, name uniqueness and a geographic reference point
for registrants.  NeuStar maintains and enhances this locality-based
structure even as it administers the expanded second-level .US domain.

There really has been a rush to use .com - someone mentioned that it
is the default used by some browsers - and the general public seems to
be convinced that it is necessary.  This has been so much so that the
State of North Carolina changed its web site from:

http://www.state.nc.us/ to http://www.ncgov.com/  

in order to fit in with what the general public expects.  (They keep the
old URL and redirect hits to it to the new one.)

Cellular - most often CDPD (Cellular Data Packet and I forget what the
last D stands for). Essentially they use TCP/IP over cellular. The
last time I worked with it you could get connection speeds up to 19.2
Kbps which is much more than enough for an ATM transaction.

One word: encryption. And it isn't just a simple "here's my password,
where's my data" transaction, there is significant handshaking and
protocols that have to be used. In another life I worked for an ATM
network; I worked on back-office software (billing and settlement) but
I did get exposure to the ATM handling part.

There are two different kinds of fraud that I envision in this
situation: stealing account numbers and PIN or convincing the machine
to give currency without deducting it from an account. The first would
involve monitoring the traffic for that machine, but remember that the
traffic is encrypted and PIN is never sent in the clear (it is
encrypted before being put into the packet being sent; the packet
itself is encrypted). The second would involve taking over the
cellular traffic (overriding the local tower), pretending to be the
bank, and figuring out the instructions that say "spit out X dollar
bills" (not easy, and besides, those portable machines don't hold much
cash).

ONE NOTE: please do not use ALL CAPS. It is hard to read and is interpreted
as being "shouts".

Here in Australia we've recently had a spate of ATM fraud where
machines were equipped with "skimmers" to record the card's mag stripe
data and they also stole you PIN by having "pinhole" cameras mounted
above the keypads.

Once the crook has both of these, it's then "party time" with your
funds.

Also in some ATM locations where you need to swipe a card to gain
entrance to a secure room have been hit in a similar way, but the
publicity now has people on the lookout for any strange "additions" to
the card swipe equipment and arrests have been made.

If "portable" ATM's become common, it is possible that people won't be
familiar with this equipment and the "skimming" fraud may have more
opportunity to occur as a result of this.

The basis of the decision (I believe) was that because the article was
available in a location where the person had a reputation that could
be damaged, the case must be heard in that jurisdiction.

Some people have "scaremongered" that anyone publishing on the 'net
will now have to take into account the defamation laws *all* around
the world, but in reality this decision should only make it necessary
to take into account the laws where any defamation could actually
occur. - see, it's not as bad as first thought......  :-(

EXACTLY !!!

This is something that many of the replies "conveniently" have ignored,
or "downplayed".

Why should ANYONE who doesn't actually *LIVE* here in the NANP (for
any period of time) even *CARE* what our (sent-paid toll) IDDD or
intra-NANP access digits/prefixes even *ARE*!?

If you are not at your home telephone (or your OWN cellular phone),
and you need to make toll calls, whether in the same country code or
to a different country code, if you are calling from a pay/coin/public
phone, or your PBX at work (for NON work-related toll calls), or a
motel/hotel/ hospital room, most would be more likely to use their
calling card, pre-paid card, etc., even if this also means "home
country direct" access. You'll dial whatever the toll-free number
happens to be, to access the platform of the carrier of your choice.

Even the "domestic sent-paid toll" prefix, whether it is '0+', '1+' or
anything else, shouldn't matter to you if you aren't at the phone line
that YOU are paying for! Of course, it might happen to be that the
toll-free number "itself" has to first be prefixed with a 0 or 1, as
in the 1+800/888/etc. in the NANP, or in many other countries, the '0'
before the 800 (but always written as a block, 0800-), that prefix
being the same as a "toll-indicating/accepting" or "out-of-home-area-
code" access prefix.  Even a UIFN number might be your "home country
direct" access number, but the carrier issuing you the card/account
will inform you of the access numbers including ALL needed digits, to
use FROM the country you are visiting ... i.e., you might be using a
UIFN number as 00800+etc. from one country, and it could be the "same"
UIFN home-country direct number from the NANP but as 011+800-etc.

If you are buying a "prepaid" type of card for placing calls, even if
you have to dial a "prefix" to indicate that you are then dialing a
toll-free number to access the card platform, the instructions that
come with the card will indicate what is to be dialed. You don't
really have to "know" what that the sent-paid toll prefix might happen
to be the access digit(s) for placing calls to toll-free numbers.

And, if your "host" *PERMITS* you to place domestic calls or
international calls "sent-paid" to HIS (or her) line at home (or from
work, if the PBX or individual work lines are "unrestricted"), then
that is *THEIR* choice, and they would probably tell you to dial 011+
before the country-code/etc.  if calling from the NANP.

And then, if you choose to carry your own wireless phone with you on
your overseas travels, you probably have an international calling and
roaming plan. And as has been mentioned here several times, many GSM
phones have a way for you to indicate a "PLUS" (+) symbol as part of
entering/keying your destination dial-string, a leading '+' symbol
tells the phone OR the cellular switch that the keyed destination
number digits are strictly in the full worldwide format. You don't
even have to "know" what the IDDD access prefix happens to be from the
calling country you are in/visiting!

NOBODY should be "expecting" that the NANP "adopt" in parallel, or
worse completely change over, to 00+ for IDDD sent-paid (or even
special billing). If you don't "pay" for that line, then it is NONE of
your business WHAT codes happen to be used! (Of course, most of us ARE
"telephone geeks" who are INTERESTED in what different countries of
the world might use, but it should only be simply a matter of interest
and curiousity, and NOT to demand that we must change).

Actually, "special billing" services, traditionally from the NANP
dialed as 0+ (for intra-NANP domestic, where the area code / ten-digit
NANP number does *not* begin with '0' or'1') or 01+ (for IDDD, and
since you can't call intra-NANP this way, the country code does *NOT*
begin with '0' or '1') ... it is BETTER these days for one to place
ALL card or special billing calls NOT as 0+/01+, but rather via a
1-800/888/etc. "dialup" to the carrier's platform -- for the CARRIER
of YOUR choice, preferably the carrier who issued you the card which
you probably have a savings/discount plan for!

Even when using 101-XXXX+ 'CIC' codes for indicating your carrier on
0+/01+ dialing, you still can expect routing/service AND billing/rate/
charging "surprises". Using the toll-free access numbers indicated by
your carrier on the back of your card to access their card/operator
menu platform, you are probably "better off" with all of the private
payphones, PBX operator "services" (hotels/motels/hospitals/etc), and
even cellular systems trying to route you to who THEY want to route
you to (and bill you thru) on traditionally dialed 0+/01+.

That's one of the reasons why AT&T is most certainly marketing
1-800-CALL-ATT for using the AT&T calling card when away from your
home phone and placing "toll" calls, originating from the US and
Canada ... (Hopefully, one makes certain to LISTEN to the
branding/prompting/menu/etc when using 1-800- type dial-ups, due to
the SLEAZE operator entities who want you to "fat-finger" dial, but
that's another story!)

If someone using your PBX is making "prank" calls then why wouldn't you
want to be told about them by letting your attendant answer them?

You should then make a note of the outgoing COT and investigate the
SMDR records to find out who in your organisation is abusing the
telephone system.

BTW, I believe you can route individual COTS to DN's on a SL-1, but I
can't remember how it is done, (I think I've seen it done for incoming
Fax numbers).

Certainly more true than it used to be, but there are still some brands
that mean something.  The only example that comes to mind, offhand, is
Hershey.

Personal video recorders already have Hollywood running scared. Now 
Microsoft is pushing a new computer that will make trading TV shows 
as easy as using ... Napster.

By Farhad Manjoo

Dec. 9, 2002  |  "Like Mr. Ed," says Craig Newmark, "I never speak 
until I have something to say." It's a crisp fall morning in San 
Francisco, and Newmark, sipping coffee at his neighborhood cafe, is 
in the middle of a long discussion of the ethics involved in watching 
television. He's invoked TV's talking horse to explain his fight with 
TV's fat cats: He's suing the media companies whose executives have 
been calling people like him -- people who use personal video 
recorders, or PVRs, such as TiVo and ReplayTV -- "thieves."

But Newmark, the founder of Craig's List, one of the most popular 
community sites on the Web, wants to talk about more than just 
television. He prefers to focus on "fairness," a concept that is dear 
to him, and that he says ought to be at the heart of not only TV but 
the distribution of all art. Having been indirectly accused by 
entertainment industry executives and attorneys of "copyright 
infringement" simply for using his beloved ReplayTV, Newmark has had 
reason, unlike many Americans, to think about whether the way he 
watches TV is "fair."

Is he being unfair if he sets his ReplayTV to record an episode of 
"The West Wing," one of his favorite shows, so he can watch it later? 
Is Newmark "stealing" from David Letterman -- "my TV pal" -- if he 
sets his Replay to skip the ads on "The Late Show"? And are artists 
really going hungry, and is Newmark really killing an industry, if, 
once in a while, he transfers some of the shows he records on his 
ReplayTV to his notebook computer, so he can watch TV while he's 
traveling?

Subject: Denmark Bills Users for Downloads


By Peter Rojas
02:00 AM Dec. 11, 2002 PT

A group affiliated with the Danish music, film and software 
industries has been sending out invoices to users of peer-to-peer 
file-sharing networks like Kazaa and eDonkey, demanding payment for 
downloaded copies of songs, movies or video games.

Earlier this year, AntiPiratGruppen (Anti-Piracy Group) began 
tracking the activities of Danish users of file-sharing networks, and 
then contacting the appropriate Internet service providers demanding 
users' names and addresses.

Late last month, with contact information in hand, the group began 
mailing out invoices, charging $8 per album, $25 per movie and $40 
per video game that appeared in a user's shared folder. The group 
threatened invoice recipients with legal action should the sum 
demanded remain unpaid.

I hope someone can point me in the right direction for getting useful
advice on this matter.

My girlfriend lives on a farm several miles out of town, near 
Punxsutawney, PA.  For several years, we've tried at various times to 
get her internet service at her home.  Invariably, we can never get any 
modems to handshake on her phoneline.  I suspect its poor line quality, 
but not being a phone line expert, I'm not entirely sure.

We've tried a wide variety of modems (none of them WinModems), and
have tried various baud rates as well, thinking slower speeds might
accomodate a connection.  Sadly, that had no effect.

We've tried to connect to remote modems both local to the area as well
as long distance (both via 800 toll free, and via toll calls).  This
didn't seem to make any difference either.

We've also tried a "line filter" (I think that's the name for it) that
was gotten at a local Radio Shack and goes inline between the computer
and the wall jack.

Consistently, when trying to dial out, the other end will answer, and
then the modems will squeal and chirp back and forth at each other
until the connection attempt times out, never able to establish a
proper handshake.

We've had the phone company out to the residence and they did some
stuff to the phone box on the outside of her house, but it didn't seem
to make any difference.

Unfortunately, $$$ prevent her from trying one of the satellite-only
based internet access services that have come around in the past
several years.

So ... I'm wondering two things:

1)  Is there anything we can do at her end to try and improve phone line 
conditions so the connection will succeed?

2)  Is there something we can say to the phone company that will 
convince them to do something to improve the line conditions?

Your assistance is appreciated!!!

Our esteemed moderator scribes:

The Romans managed to migrate out of Rome itself and into Byzantium.
In that sense the "Roman" empire lasted for nearly 1800 years (300 BC
to around 1500AD).

The Chinese empire lasted for longer. There were several changes at
the top, but since the real power in China was the local governors,
the changes at the top at little influence on most of the populace.

But your point is well taken. The Western Roman Empire got arrogant
and then overrun. The Eastern Roman Empire, on the other paw learned
out to accomodate itself to its neighbors (much to the consternation
of later Western European rulers).

The danger that the US faces is internal. The last few years have seen
people give up many if not all of their rights to privacy and freedom
of expression. The laws clamping down on the Internet (returning to
topic) are just one level of that loss.

On one of my lines I have forward-on-busy to voice mail, which gets
rid of telemarketers pretty well.  It's only $3.95/mo.

But on my other line I have a wonderful feature that I refer to as
Call Defer.  If someone tries to call me while I'm already on the
phone, Call Defer automatically activates and alerts the caller via a
special intermittent tone that they'll be able to enjoy my full and
uninterrupted attention if they call back later.  Remarkably, this
feature is provided by my phone company at no charge.

Perhaps if we tell more people about it, they'll get the hint.

But there is *already* a way to show numbers without any confusion.
Write numbers in the format that the ITU recommends i.e. +country code
area code number e.g. +44 20 7654 3210 or +31 20 654 3210.  If people
are educated that + means put your international access code before
the number there would be no ambiguity at all.  I'd bet that most
people in Europe and even in the UK know what this means.  North
Americans probably wouldn't know, but writing a number as +1 311 555
2368 would probably not confuse North Americans as they'd probably
think that someone just "meant" to write it as 1-311-555-2368 which is
an acceptable way to write the number.

Even Hershey bought up a bunch of national brands that have no more

full information on these changes are available for all employees.
Study the rates carefully so that you can answer the questions of
subscribers."  I remember this attitude, that all employees should be
prepared to represent the company to the public, was later embodied in
a slogan, "To the public _you_ are the telephone company," that was
constantly presented to employees.

On page 2 is a photograph of sheep with their heads in the grass, and
an amusig caption: "Sheep (Eating) In July, our explanation that the
folks in the frontspiece were stacking wheat brought a protest from
Kansas that they were not stacking but were shocking wheat.  This time
we take no chances.  Grazing, as we remember, is the right term, but
we are not sheepherders. (Texas panhandle, please note.)"

The first article is a bio of Charles P. Cooper, former president of
Ohio Bell who was just elected vice-president of AT&T.

Next there are five pages with pictures reporting on a Telephone
Pioneers meeting in New York City.  Among other activities they
visited AT&T headquarters, Bell Labs, and New York Telephone
headquarters and were greeted by executives of those companies.  The
highlight was an address by Thomas A. Watson, who told of his
experiences as a colleague of Alexander Graham Bell.  This was
followed by a demonstration of talking movies, including one depicting
the invention of the telephone and narrated by Watson.

Then there is an article "Efficient and Courteous" by an anonymous
"counterman".  He tells of receiving a letter of commendation from a
customer.  Even though he had had to turn down the customer's request
for service he had fully explained why there was a shortage of
facilities in the customer's area, and the problems of the company in
extending its lines.

Then the medical director of AT&T writes to those who have just
returned from vacations, urging them to use their spare time during
the week as a "vacation all year."  He suggests they get out of doors,
do the essential chores, of course, but do something recreational.
" ... forget as far as possible that you ever worked for the Telephone
Company."

The telephone exhibit at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exposition
is described, with a reminder that the telephone was first exhibited
at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia 50 years earlier.  The
1926 exhibit includes a showing of motion pictures, two of which are
talking.  One of these features Thomas A. Watson [and is presumably
the same film that was shown to the Pioneers]; and the other
"contrasts the noisy operating room and crude apparatus of the
eighties, when boys were operators, with the central office of the
present."

I guess in those days AT&T stock was marketed through telephone
offices, as there is an article about how an AT&T rights offering was
handled.  There are accounts of company employees persuading the
public to buy stock, and also of people who threw away the rights
documents, not realizing they had monetary value.

There's a short item about telephone operators assisting when there
was an explosion at a high school, and another showing the first
installation of a P.A. system in a school, with switching so that
music or voice can be had in any combination of rooms.

Then there is the second part of an article reprinted from _Telephony_
by an operator, Manta J. Elder, about her experiences.  There were
annual floods when the Marais-des-Cygnes overran its banks near
Ottawa, Kansas.  Many operators lived across the river from the
telephone office and had to cross the river in canoes and stay at the
office so they would be available.  Also severe winters when the
streets were impassable to vehicles and the company sent horses to the
residence of each operator to bring them to work.

Sleet storms in February took lines down, so things were very quiet at
the switchboard until service was restored; and then everybody wanted
to use the telephone.  She tells of working the last day at an old
switchboard before cutover to a new one in a new office.  "The next
day I went by the old office, and my feet naturally led me up the old
stairway.  If I had known that I should see the salvaging force at
their work, I would never had have the courage to enter the old room.
The board was already sadly wrecked.  It seemed to me that I was
looking upon something almost human, which was being made to suffer
after years of patient and loving service to a public which now gives
it no thought.

     "As I walked on toward my home, I fell to thinking of the many
     and varied messages that had been carried through that old
     public servant.  The first news of special interest to all people
     handled through its channels was the news of Admiral Dewey's
     victory at Manila Bay, which occurred about three weeks after
     the installation of the board.

     "Service began on this old switchboard June 13, 1898, and
     except for one hour during President McKinley's funeral, until
     December, 1915, it was a living part of the community it so
     faithfully served."

She goes on to tell of the World War, and of the influenza epidemic.
Says that in earlier times the telephone operators often complained
that they were not appreciated by the public, but at the time of
writing most people are truly appreciative of their services.
A little of the history of the company, which was originally the
Kansas City Telephone company, called the "Home" Company; at the
time of abandonment of the old switchboard the "Home" and "Bell"
companies were consolidated under the name of "The Kansas Telephone
Company", in the spring of 1915.  On January 1, 1926, the company
was transferred to Southwestern Bell.

Then there are three pages of managerial personnel changes, with
some portraits.  Then an article about formation of the Charles S.
Gleed chapter of Telephone Pioneers in Kansas City, and an article
about the switchboard in St. Louis being extremely busy in the
aftermath of the St. Louis Cardinals winning the National League
pennant.

A page of short items: Clemenceau quoted on the need for technical
experts to be aware of matters outside the scope of their expertise;
a comment on the article by "a counterman"; an article about the
recent AT&T stock issue; and a repeat of the item about new long
distance rates and practices.  

Four pages with pictures about Bell Telephone Laboratores, and
some unrelated pictures of employees enjoying their summer
vacations.

Two pages about Texas beginning a new billing method: instead
of billing all customers on the same day of the month they will
spread the billing dates throughout the month to smooth out
the workload.

Two pages about handling mail in the headquarters mail room,
the need for good addresses, and the problem of customers sending
cash in the mail when paying their bills; an average of $15
a day is found in the mail room when the supervisor has to open
inadequately addressed mail.

Then a rather technical article, with schematic diagram, of a
circuit to simplify cutting phantom transpositions. (When a
phantom circuit is added to two existing circuits it is necessary
to alter the way the wires are transposed on the poles.  This must
be done without interrupting service on the exiting circuits any
longer than necessary.)

Two pages of service records, including portraits of seven men
who have worked a total of 185 years.

One page about the "first annual" Watermelon Festival in Hope, AR.

An article about keeping score on collection work; teams get
points for minimizing the need to communicate with subscribers
to get them to pay their bills.

Photographs of the new Norman, OK office, and an open house for
visitors.  Suggestions for Halloween costumes (illustrations) and two
pages of illustrations of ladies' fashion suggestions.  A page of
cartoons by "Stack", with a Halloween theme.

Three pages telling where every construction crew is working and what
jobs they are working on.  Some photos, including a cable splicer and
his helper with what appears to be a push cart containing their tools
and supplies.  A page with a map of the company's territory, showing
the locations of all lost-time accidents for the year.  Four pages of
social news: parties, retirements, contests won, other activities.
"Anyone at St.  Louis Toll who wants a thrill, should let Miss Hogan
take them riding in her Ford.  She misses other cars by a fender."

A page "What I Did Today" containing stories by operators of how they
assisted the public.  A page of poetry written by telephone people.

Inside back cover, a list of the principal management officers of the
company and their titles.  Back cover, an AT&T advertisement.  This
one shows operators being delivered to their office in a truck in a
howling blizzard; and the text tells how people take the telephone for
granted, how different life would be without it, and how 300,000
telephone people work to maintain dependable service.

Many Linksys' network appliances have a remote administration and
configuration interface via HTTP, either from the local network,
or, if it's enabled, from any host across the internet.
The implementation of the embedded HTTP server presents several
different exploitable vulnerabilities, some of them allow an
unauthorized user to gain control of the appliance, some let an

Quick Prosecutions in Horse Racing Scam
By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- With one guilty plea Wednesday and another 
expected, the prosecution of three college buddies is ending less 
than two months after suspicions were raised by a $3 million payoff 
at the Breeders' Cup.

Glen DaSilva, a technology management consultant from New York,
admitted in federal court Wednesday that he had made about $200,000
through two conspiracies: one that used bet-processing computers to
alter wagers and one that duplicated other horse players' winning
tickets.

The three former fraternity brothers charged in the scheme were 
caught, DaSilva's lawyer said, because, ``These guys are amateurs. 
They're really not cut out for a life of crime.''

The same thing is happening here.

I've seen references along the lines of how BT (British Telecom)
"built and developed" the STD network in the 1960s.  It must have been
quite an achievement for them, seeing as BT didn't exist back then!

Even the well-known London landmark, the Post Office Tower, was renamed the 
BT Tower.

than a century at being a telco, in the northern part of Kansas in
many/most non-Bell areas, such as Junction City. Of course, Sprint

their 'more than a century' advertising.   PAT]

These systems do indeed use standard modems operating over cellphones,
with triple DES encryption, just like the normal modems used for
wireline ATM machines.

So, intercepting communications won't buy you any more than just
tapping into the phone line of a wireline ATM, which is pretty much
nothing.

They are pretty secure.  Unfortunately every time I have seen them used
at festivals they had all sorts of mechanical problems, since the money
dispensing mechanisms weren't really intended to withstand the kind of
vibration that putting them on the road produces.

We live near Rochester, NY and currently use Sprint PCS. The coverage
is spotty, especially in more rural areas. We would like to switch to
another service, but would like to make sure (at least as much as
possible) that the coverage will be better.

Is there some resource that lists the towers used by the various
services? I'm hoping that that will help to tell us how good a
service's coverage is.

Thanks,

I can solve this problem with two words:  "Busy signal"

Any time Call Waiting kicks in on any call, it's obnoxious.  Why
should I pay extra to be annoyed?  So I don't.  If I'm on the phone
when you call, you'll get a busy signal.  An old-school, deprecated,
luddite busy signal.

If you need to take emergency calls, get a pager or voicemail.  Call
waiting is a pox on society.

No.  Yes, if you've initiated the call, there's a code you can punch
in at the beginning of the call to turn off call-waiting.  In this
case, I had received the call.  Any incoming calls would get ring
incoming calls via call-waiting (ie: when a call is already in
progress) so I didn't know who was calling -- but I WAS expecting one
important call.  My intention was to quickly take that call and
inform them I'd call back, then resume my long-distance call (which
my friend was paying for -- from the UK, in fact).

And what's the problem with waiting 30 seconds or less while someone
informs their second caller that they'll call back?  That's called
courtesy, as opposed to just ignoring the caller and letting them
assume I'm not at home and/or am ignoring them.

Normally I would agree with you.  However, I frequently call the
CIBC's 1-800 number to do telephone banking and/or to make inquiries,
and inevitably, at the conclusion of the call, when I'm done and am
saying goodbye, the droid at the other end tries to get me to hang on
the line while they sell me some new service.  In other words, their
regular phone staff are also trained to telemarket, so it would seem
to me to be highly unlikely that the CIBC, having invested time and
money into training THESE people to telemarket, would then choose to
outsource their cold-calling telemarketing.  But, of course, this is
just speculation.

I was both polite and firm when I interrupted her sales pitch with the
words "I do not accept telemarketing calls.  Please add me to your do
not call list".  The problem was that I could only ever get halfway
through that statement before she would interrupt, in an almost
shrieking tone, to deny she was a telemarketer.  I remained both
polite and firm throughout the call.  Every time an opening presented,
I began to repeat the entire phrase "I do not accept telemarketing
calls.  Please add me to your do not call list".  Most people would
have got the message: I am not responding to anything you say in your
defence, I'm repeating my same line over and over -- it's USELESS to
argue with me.  This girl didn't figure that out.

As to telling her I was on another important call, I see your point
but I stand on principle: what I was doing at the moment her call
came in is immaterial.  Her call was not welcome and would profit
neither her nor CIBC, and it wouldn't have mattered if I had just
been sitting there staring at the phone or in the middle of the
biggest business deal of the century or furiously masturbating.  I
shouldn't have to make excuses to put off somebody that I wouldn't
talk to even if I didn't have an excuse.

Come to think of it, that would be a REALLY funny thing to say to a
telemarketer.  "Sorry, can't talk, I'm masturbating".  ROFLMAO!

This girl had information that, presumably, only my bank should have
had.

I have a better reputation with the CIBC than I probably do here.  :-)
And really, most people's dealings with their bank nowadays (for those
who live in big cities that is - this wouldn't include folks like Pat
who actually SEE their banker once in a while) is quite impersonal.
When I call CIBC telebanking, I'm talking to someone in Montreal - a
place that would take me about three and a half days of non-stop
driving to visit (I'm in Calgary, a few hours north of Montana).  The
emailed reply I got from them came from a woman even further away, in
Nova Scotia.  I opened my bank account at my then-local branch 17
years ago -- I have since set foot in the place EXACTLY ONCE.
Interestingly, it was to update the signature on my signature card --
it had changed a bit over the years and that caused a cheque I wrote
to be dishonoured.

So in terms of "my reputation" ... exactly who am I trying to impress?
At worst, there mightb be a notation in a file somewhere saying that
I'm a loud-mouth troublemaker, but for the most part I'm just another
number in the system.  If I were Pat, and had to deal with my banker
IN PERSON on a regular basis, I might be more worried about "my
reputation" vis-a-vis my relationship with the bank - certainly I'd
have been a bit more diplomatic.

I've found, though, that when dealing with a massive bureaucracy, it's
the squeaky wheel that gets the grease.  Being diplomatic, and using
phrases like "I am deeply concerned" rather than "I'm fed up!"  or

Yeah, this is their latest trick.  Even the door-to-door people are
doing it.  At the office I work at, we have a "no soliciting" sign on
the door.  Often, I see them walk up, see the sign, and carry on PAST
our door.  But a few just waltz right in.  I usually stop them, with a
SMILE, and say "sorry, we're not interested, and we have a 'no
soliciting' sign there on the door" and I point towards it.  It's not
at eye-level so it can be missed, and often I'll get a "oh, I'm
terribly sorry, I didn't see the sign" response and everything's cool.
But sometimes I get the hot-shot who figures he can make the sale
despite the roadblocks he faces, and that is their latest trick: to
claim that they're not "soliciting".  Why they bother, I have no idea:
I've already made it clear that I'm absolutely not interested in
whatever it is he's selling, and now he's pissed me off.  Yeah, that's
a good way to persuade people.  :-)

Anyways, what I do now is this: the very moment they claim they're not
soliciting, I say "hang on a sec", reach behind me, and pull out a
pre-printed page, and hand it to them.  They read the following text:

          Definition Of "Soliciting"
          --------------------------

1) To seek to obtain - by persuasion, entreaty, or formal application
   - trade or charity.
2) To petition persistently; importune.
3) To entice or incite to evil or illegal action.
4) To approach or accost (a person) with an offer of sexual services.

If you are here for any of these purposes, we are not interested,
thanks.

I've handed out eight of these so far in the last year.  Seven of
them just sorta shrugged and walked out (and all seven of them took
the sheet with them).  An eighth guy, with enlarged testicles, again
started the denial line about how he wasn't actually selling
anything, he was just here to inform me of this, that, and the other.

I interrupted him and said "Yeah, but look at #2.  You're petitioning
me persistently, and you've importuned me".  I half expected him to
ask me to define "importune" cuz he looked kinda puzzled.  Then I
guess he finally realized that even if he won the argument, he'd lost
the war.  He turned around and walked out the door.  :-)

Don't get me wrong: politeness works most of the time.  It's the
rat-bastards who won't take no for an answer that require stronger
measures.  :-)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The bank I use, although a branch of
a larger operation -- Commerce Bank, N.A. really is a small town sort
of operation. But next door to it is an even smaller bank, 'First
National Bank of Independence'. They have six full time employees, 
which includes the branch of the bank in Elk City, Kansas. My branch
bank, Commerce Bank, has seven or eight full time employees. It is not
uncommon for people to stand around at the teller's line talking to
the two ladies on duty there. They report to the cashier; she in turn
reports to the manager as does the customer service person. I would
*never* want to do business again with a giant bank like First
National Bank of Chicago. I am *so glad* I got out of that town. 

Regards shaking off persistent solicitors: Just like in Chicago, the
Jehovah Witness people here are persistent solicitors. An aquaintence
of mine locally here has used that sexual innuendo line on the Jehovah
people when they come to call. 'Pardon me, you wil have to excuse me;
I am busy right now fu----- my wife.' (or masturbating, or getting
fu---- by my boyfriend, etc). The first couple times the Witnesses
heard that excuse, they apparently looked sort of askance. I guess it
does not phase them any longer. I guess all it got my friend was a
reputation as some sort of dreadful pervert and all the more in need
of being converted/'saved'. In small towns you know, everyone talks to
other people; even the Witnesses tell others in their church, etc, and
their other friends.  PAT]

Maybe I've missed an issue of the Digest somewhere, as I don't remember

Still, 19 was used by France and its colonies/followers.   19 might seem an 
odd choice to telephone "outsiders," but was quite logical by French 
standards at it fitted into their other 1x service codes (operator, 
directory, emergency).

Reading numbers may at present be limited to 3xx and 9xx, but the
whole point of expanding the local numbers to 7-digits was to increase
capacity for the future.  That means that within a few years we almost
certainly *will* see other Reading prefixes.

0119 is a spare code at present, but there's no reason why it couldn't
be adopted when the next growing city is forced to migrate to 7-digit
numbering.  All the codes 0113 thru 0118 have been allocated, so I
wouldn't be surprised to see 0119 used in the not-too-dustant future.

As for "what passes for UK current numbering policy," I agree with
your sentiments entirely.  The mess that's been made of the network in
the last few years is just incredible!

I take your point Richard, but there is already an accepted practice
to indicate international numbers.  You used it yourself at the bottom

I'd say that this was very unfortunate for the people in Nottingham
who were disturbed by the calls, but I don't believe that national and
international telephone networks should be forced into expensive and
unnecessary changes just because a few sleaze merchants can't be
bothered to advertise their number properly.

Come to think of it, if so many people in the U.K. know that the IDDD
prefix is now 00, why did so many dial 011 592 in the belief that they
were calling Guyana?  Better yet, how about the ITU commiting itself
to ridding the world of this garbage once and for all?  (Yes,

Subject: NEC VOIP is Making a Good Impression
Reply-To: jcowing101@yahoo.com
Date: Thu, 12 Dec 2002 15:34:29 GMT


TELEPHONY/CTI

VoIP shifts balance of power.
New contact center technology introduces a different legacy... [more]

A study in telephony evolution. 
A growing student body with an expanding campus complex demands
converged IP telephony system.

As the vice president for information systems and business services at
St. Petersburg College in southwest Florida, Conferlete Carney is
actively involved in the school's evolution. Since 1927, the two-year
junior college has grown into a full-fledged, four-year academic
institution, serving more than 17,000 students from 10 sites in the
Tampa Bay area. 

Yet, the college's migration to four-year status is not the only
evolutionary process Carney has witnessed. The college has begun a
four-phase program to move from its traditional time-division
multiplexing (TDM)-based telephony system into voice over Internet
protocol (VoIP), an environment that delivers voice, data and video
communications over a single converged network. 

"Our decision," Carney says, "was based on the physical layout of our
10 campuses, a major expansion at our Seminole site, the
education-specific features that voice over IP can deliver and
analyzing the management costs of using just one network to handle
both voice and data traffic. We wanted to avoid further TDM
investment." 

The move to VoIP was motivated by a significant reduction in the time
and money spent in adding, removing and changing phone numbers. "Just
the simplification of managing the voice network is enough reason to
go to IP telephony. In a converged environment, a telephone can be
plugged into the network anywhere on campus and keep the same phone
number," explains Carney. 

The VoIP network also increases the school's capacity to handle future
voice and data traffic, and facilitates several advanced applications
it plans to integrate into its network. For example, unified messaging
can deliver messages through multiple media simultaneously, including
wireless, e-mail and traditional voice mail.

Through another application-E911-campus security personnel are
instantly notified, and can conference into the call whenever someone
on campus calls a local 911 agency. Campus security then works with
local police, fire and other emergency services so that an incident is
addressed promptly and correctly. 

When evaluating each VoIP vendor, Carney and his staff weighed the
interoperability factor, whether the VoIP platform would be able to
operate reliably on the college's data network, comprised primarily of
both Cisco and Extreme Networks routers and switches. "We surmised
that NEC's VoIP products were engineered to work in an open
environment, which enables them to work successfully in virtually any
infrastructure."

St. Petersburg College started the upgrade process by installing NEC's
NEAX 2400 IPXs at three of its 10 sites, first deploying in strategic
locations, such as remote offices and satellite facilities. Other
locations are still using traditional circuit-switched telephony until
the evolution is complete next year. 

"The IPXs are unique in that they allow us to deploy both VoIP and TDM
telephony, in any combination, where we need it," Carney says. "As we
bring more of our campus toward this converged environment, the IPXs
enable us to deliver more VoIP without disrupting the network."

The next challenge was the migration of some 2,000 legacy telephones
into IP telephony instruments, capable of handling both existing and
future needs. "With some VoIP telephones costing in the neighborhood
of $700 per unit, a total replacement of our instruments was
economically unrealistic," says Jeff Rohrs, telecommunications manager
at the college. "NEC provided us with IP adapters that plug into each
phone, providing the IP connection for each unit, and they work just
as well in TDM environments."

When it completes its evolution, St. Petersburg College will have a
total VoIP network with IP telephones, soft phones that are installed
on desktop and laptop computers, and wireless converged devices that
deliver both voice and data connectivity enterprise-wide-without
disrupting the current communications system.

There have been proposals to make such use illegal here, but so far as
I am aware there is no actual law against it as yet.

Personally, I don't think we need such a law.  We already have laws
relating to "driving without due care and attention," which could be
applied if someone was clearly paying more attention to his phone than
the road.  It comes down to a matter of common sense: Use the mobile
phone only when road conditions mean that you can do so safely.

I disagree, and I live in Canada -- for the most part, our road system
is set up like the American system.  Over the course of, roughly, 1975
through 1995, the last of our traffic circles were phased out.  But in
the last couple of years, the City of Calgary has installed two new
ones, in Mackenzie Towne and Garrison Woods.  In both cases, they've
improved the flow of traffic.  The one in Mackenzie Towne has five
roads leading into it, which would have made a "regular" intersection
rather difficult.  The one in Garrison Woods used to be a three-way
stop until they rebuilt it.  I drive through this one about 3 or 4
times a week.  There's another route I could take that doesn't pass
through the roundabout, but it take about a minute longer.  Whether or
not a roundabout is on my route doesn't enter into my consideration of
whether or not to take that route.

Consider that if the UK didn't use roundabouts, but instead used
two-way stops, four-way stops, or traffic lights to control traffic
at all of the intersections you describe (ie: "every 200 yards or
so"), traffic would move much, much slower.  Y'ever tried to make a
left hand turn (or a right-hand turn in the UK) onto a busy street
from a quiet side street on a two-way stop?  You can wait for several
minutes!

I don't have the numbers handy to back this up, but I seem to recall
a study done a few years back that purported to "prove" (I know, I
know, probably too strong a statement) that traffic circles are far
more efficient at handling traffic than any of the three situations I
just spelled out.  About the only thing that works better is a
full-blown cloverleaf, which is reserved for MAJOR roads as they're
major wasters of space.

Consider that in the UK, unless traffic is very heavy, you can
generally get from point A to point B without ever having to stop
your car and wait at some stupid red light -- even though there's no
traffic crossing.  You just keep moving -- sure, much more slowly as
you move through the roundabout, but at least you're STILL MOVING.

Yes, in rush hour, they can clog up pretty good -- but no worse than a
two-way stop, four-way stop, or traffic light intersection would, and
very likely not nearly as badly (my grammar teacher is twisting in his
grave).

I submit to you that you probably find driving in North America far
more pleasurable because of a road system designed for motorized, or
at least mechanized, vehicle traffic -- as opposed to much of Great
Britain (particularly London) which is still, to this day, laid out
around footpaths and cartpaths.  In much of North America (and
especially here in Calgary, a Western Canadian city that's only been
here since just before the advent of the automobile), a high premium
is placed on building roads that continue STRAIGHT for as long as
possible, with as few bends, curves, and whatnots as possible.  Try
building such a road in London -- you can't get, as you say, 200 yards
without bumping into a building.  Also, North American roads are
considerably wider than British roads, which all by itself gives you
a certain feeling of "comfort" that you just don't get driving in the
UK (except maybe on the M1, which is tres wide, but I'm referring to
average city streets).

North American drivers have trouble with roundabouts cuz they're not
used to them.  But I've seen both in extensive action and I've even
driven through a few roundabouts in my day (ie: in the UK), and I find
them far, far preferable to this "let's put up a stop sign every 200
yards" approach favoured in North America.  I'm tired of stopping
behind the pinhead at the red light who, in an effort to prove to the
rest of us cretins that he is "safer" than we are, stops 6 meters back
of the stop line and thus fails to trip the road sensor -- meaning we

No chance -- unless there is political interference!  The growth in
demand for numbers in the UK stemmed from the arrival of multiple
competing operators, each wanting their own local ranges, and there is
now very little real growth of significance.

There is a very good reason why it couldn't - please read what I
wrote: "nor is there any scope to create one under ... current
numbering policy"

The present policy is that when any growing city has to provide for
more local numbers than a six-digit scheme will accomodate, it will
change to an EIGHT digit scheme, with a regional, rather than local,
area code of the for 02X or possibly 03X.  There will be NO more new
codes under 01.

Almost all the changes in the last few years have been to correct the
havoc that had previously been wreaked by a very misguided individual;
now we have a thought-through policy, which obviously is restricted in
implementation to particular parts of the country: but provided we
follow it we should end up with a stable and well-understood scheme;
indeed, one as well-understood and easy to use as the NPA-NXX scheme
in manner way it was *originally* introduced in World Zone One.  With
an added bonus that WE have consistent dialling plans, and they don't!

But then I would say that, wouldn't I?  ;-0))

> already an accepted practice to indicate international numbers

There is already an accepted METHOD to indicate international numbers,
but I would not call it an accepted practice until such time as the
average user (such as is often referred to in here as "Joe-Sixpack")
is in the habit of using the +CCC notation.  Until then we have to
assume (and if you look at advertisements that have an international
audience, you will see that THEY also assume) that the average user
knows NOTHING about + anything, and if they're going to be making any
phone calls they'll want to see the number they have to call in the
exact format that they will have to dial it, digit by digit.

Sometimes we who work in, or close to, the technology industries, take
for granted far too much about the level of understanding of others
outside those industries: both about the technology and how it is
meant to affect them.  I'm conscious that I also tend to make this
mistake from time to time, and then I have to stop and explain things
clearly.

It isn't just the sleaze merchants ... the problem of advertising
domestic numbers across international borders is well established.  It
contributed to the reason why, for example, Eire (the Republic of
Ireland), uses 1800 and not 0800 as in the UK and Northern Ireland.

One of they KEY objectives of anyone designing a telephone numbering
plan, is to minimise the impact of misdialling which, statistically,
is bound to happen.

I don't believe that many people in the UK know that the IDD prefix
is "00" -- hence the number that fall for "scam" numbers like 00683,
and 00690, which are short enough to look like domestic numbers.
People only find out their mistake when their phone bill arrives!

But in the case I was quoting, they didn't know they were calling
Guyana.  They didn't know where they were calling.  All they knew was
that the web page said that to hear various erotic material, they had
to dial 011 592 5xxxxx.  And that's exactly what they did.

> Better yet, how about the ITU committing itself to ridding the
> world of this garbage once and for all?

Until recently, the ITU actually *protected* such schemes because of
the revenue they brought to their various "members" - even though they
contravene the official recommendations by having numbers route calls
to countries other than those to which the ITU allocated the country
code used -- and the ITU "Nairobi Convention" in particular has been
used as grounds to bring legal cases to stop operators from protecting
their customer base by blocking access to the fraudulent number
ranges.  Only in the last year or so have I seen letters from the ITU
that attempt to point out the hidden dangers of such schemes.
Hopefully one day they will start to take a more ethical position.

This is also similar to my own company's marketing.  Here's a quote from
one of our annual reports:

    When the Internet was first conceived, we were there, helping to make
    it happen. In fact, we built and operated some of the first components,
    the packet switches and routers. We sent the world's first e-mail.

However, the company named Genuity didn't exist in the 70's when this was
all happening.  The company the above quote is talking about is Bolt,
Beranek, and Newman (BBN).  BBN was acquired by GTE 4-5 years ago, and then
Genuity was spun off as a public company 2 years ago when GTE merged with
Bell Atlantic to form Verizon.

At first glance, it seems like there's direct continuity that makes
our claim reasonable.  However, the part of GTE that was spun off was
just the group that runs the network and sells Internet-related
services.  They kept the R&D division that used to be called BBN
Systems and Technology; it's now the BBN Technologies division of
Verizon.  If any group has legitimate claim to having "sent the
world's first e-mail", it's them, since all that early work was a big
ARPA R&D contract that BBN won.  And as for "the packet switches and
routers", that was probably BBN Communications, which was sold by BBN
6 or 7 years ago (to Lightstream, I think).  I don't think we have any
advanced R&D or electrical engineering positions in the current
company.

Almost no one who authored any RFC's is employed by Genuity.  I think
Craig Partridge was probably the most prolific BBN'er in that respect
(his name is on 27 RFC's).  He was in BBN S&T when we spun off; I
don't know offhand if he's still there, but I know he doesn't work for
Genuity.

Basically, if a company can find any link to claims like this, no
matter how tenuous, they feel justified in using it to bolster their
reputation.  It's not like most consumers are going to check the
claims.  And even if someone does dispute them, they can probably
legitimize it by pointing out that due to reorganizations and employee
mobility between divisions, there's some overlap between us and the
original Internet designers.

In this case I don't think it matters. SBC took the original companies
and turned them into crap, and everyone knows it was SBC that did it.
I don't know about Pacbell, but Ameritech was fair-to-middling in the
Customer Service department before "We don't give a rat's ass about

Re Hershey, their own brand may be OK, but they recently bought a
previously family owned, successful hard candy company, here in
Colorado (Jolly Rancher) then closed the plant, fired all the
employees, moved production to Canada, but still sell under the Jolly
Rancher name. Sad ...

John Poindexter has no more power to compile a computer dossier on 
you than I do.

by Stuart Taylor Jr.
 
Editorial writers and other guardians of privacy have had a field day
with the reports that former Reagan National Security Adviser John M.
Poindexter has come back as a cross between Dr. Strangelove and Big
Brother. Poindexter is watching you, or soon will be, his detractors
suggest, as they lovingly detail his 1990 convictions (later reversed
on appeal) for his lies to Congress about the Iran-Contra affair. The
Web site for Poindexter's "Total Information Awareness" program at the
Pentagon foolishly fans such fears, featuring the slogan "Scientia Est
Potentia"-Knowledge Is Power-complete with an ominous, all-seeing eye
atop a pyramid.

Poindexter is "getting the 'data-mining' power to snoop on every
public and private act of every American," hyperventilated William
Safire of The New York Times, in a November 14 column that helped
touch off a frenzy of similar stuff. The Homeland Security Act,
claimed Safire, would put Poindexter in control of a vast government
database, containing "every purchase you make with a credit card,
every magazine subscription you buy and medical prescription you fill,
every Web site you visit ... complaints from nosy neighbors to the
FBI," and much more.

Blather, nonsense, piffle, and flapdoodle. Poindexter has no more (and
probably less) power to compile a computer dossier on you than I
do. He has no more power to invade your privacy than the Pentagon
procurement officer for a new machine gun has to shoot you with it.
He might like to create a grand central database in which to fish
through billions of transactions and other records for clues on
possible terrorists. But he got no such authority from the homeland
security bill and -- given his Iran-Contra baggage -- he never will 
get it.

Satellite-television company Hughes Electronics on Friday will
"clarify" its future plans for residential satellite-based Web
services, following a published report indicating those services might
be discontinued, a company representative said.

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Hughes is revisiting
plans to let its 11 million DirecTV subscribers use the satellite
network for Web services, after a proposed merger with rival EchoStar
unraveled this week.  Hughes may now curtail the reach of a $1.8
billion plan, dubbed Spaceway, to provide broadband Web services over
a satellite network rather than telephone or cable networks, the
newspaper said.

Spaceway had always been designed primarily for businesses, but Hughes
hoped to spin out a residential service to increase its revenue.

Subject: The Wi-Fi Boom


By ADAM BAER

ON a brisk autumn day in Portland, Ore., Paul van Veen was soaking up
some sun as he logged on to the Internet -- from a spot in bustling
Pioneer Courthouse Square. Mr. van Veen was looking for a job, and he
was surfing the Web over a free wireless connection.

These days, Pioneer Courthouse Square is but one of some 140 public
spots across Portland with free Internet access using a high-speed
wireless technology known as Wi-Fi. The network of such Wi-Fi "hot
spots" throughout the city was developed by Personal Telco, a
grass-roots, nonprofit group devoted to blanketing the city with free
access points.

Portland and Personal Telco are just part of a growing national
trend. There are community groups promoting public Wi-Fi access in
nearly every large American city, from NYCwireless, which "unwired"
Bryant Park and Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan, to KC Wireless in
the Kansas City area. They have been joined by independent cafes and
restaurants, apartment houses and community centers across the country
that view free, easy access to the Internet as a draw for customers.

At the same time, subscription services and pay-as-you-go Wi-Fi hot
spots are springing up in cafes, bookstores, hotels and airports, put
in by companies like T-Mobile and smaller, start-up competitors like
Boingo Wireless and Wayport. Last week, Cometa Networks, a new company
backed by Intel, AT&T and I.B.M., said it planned to put a network of
thousands of wireless access points across a huge swath of the nation
by 2004. The result is a growing array of options for Wi-Fi users and
the emergence of a mobile wireless culture that spans business
travelers, teachers and students, people relaxing in coffee shops and
even moviegoers waiting for the show.

Hate the sender all you want, the sad fact is that you may very well
be the person ultimately responsible for the spam you receive by
giving your address out to various Web sites, posting it to newsgroups
or mailing lists, or otherwise exposing it in places where anyone can
find it.

It's pretty common these days to use a decoy account.  Use one account
on a free service like Microsoft's (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people )
Hotmail or Yahoo!  (nasdaq: YHOO - news - people ) to give out to Web
sites and mailing lists, while keeping your "real" e-mail account --
that is, the one you want your friends and family to actually use -- a
secret given only to trusted people.  That works to a point.  But it
means keeping track of more than a single e-mail account, which can
present its own set of organizational challenges.

But a Web service called Spamex gives you a new weapon: A disposable
e-mail address.  The minute spammers get their grubby little paws on it,
you can turn it off so that the next time they try to spam you, the
message bounces back as though your address was never there.

Not bad!  If I had more patience, I would pull something like that on the

So far we are lucky that we don't have many house-to-house salespeople
here, mainly people soliciting for charity or religions.

But I expect a recent Supreme Court decision may change that.  The JWs
were told they would have to "register" in some town, which I have
forgotten the name of, and apparently the court said that was in
infringement of freedom of speech.

I agree.  I am not as polite with telemarketers as I used to be.

I think I may check into the cost comparisons of "voice mail on busy"
as an alternative to Call Waiting for the person I was talking about
who always gets the other call, even when I'm paying for the call.

For a while I thought Voice Mail on my wireless phone would be a Good
Idea.  But now I am having strong second thoughts.  I am seriously
thinking of having Voice Mail turned off and just be more careful
about checking my home phone answering machine when I'm away for more
than a day or so.

I found out I get minutes deducted for each call that I don't answer
that goes to Voice Mail, whether or not they leave a message.  It
could be a real problem if someone decided to leave a long message or
if that phone number got found by telemarketers.

Joey talked about the "droids" who always try to sell a service even
when the caller is calling about an existing service.  Many phone
companies are doing the same thing now.  They say they are reducing
the sales staff and having the customer service people do more
selling.  I think that will backfire on them unless they are also told
to back off quickly when customers decline to hear their pitch.

I don't know how long it will last, but the few times I have talked
with Verizon Wireless reps, they have not tried to pitch other
services to me.  SBC/Ameritech has a policy now of asking their reps
to try to pitch other services to customers.

http://www.berkana.com/tower.html shows various towers, but not all.
Some are listed by a past name.  Some are probably on tower
aggregators so they may not be listed.

As far as gauging mobile reception where you are advice from people
about cities or towns won't be very useful to you.  If you have near
neighbors and they have mobile service asking them would be the
prudent thing to do.  If they have good service you might ask them if
they could come over to your house and you could observe how good or
bad the service is.  Keep in mind that mobile service is very
dependent on location location location!  If you have lots of
terrestrial objects whether they be buildings or hills it will
ultimately affect what kind of coverage you get.  Mobile phone service
is essentially radio service and is subject to the same types of
limitations as radio is.  If coverage is spotty with Sprint it may
also be spotty with other carriers, but not necessarily.  It's pretty
much trial and error to find who does (if anyone) cover your area
well.  If you happen to be in the "shade" you may be out of luck
entirely.

Subject: Success Against Telemarketers in Small Claims Court


I've been doing pretty well against telemarketers here in
Massachusetts.  So far this year, the court has awarded me $2000 (plus
$113.66 in court costs and interest) in three separate cases, $500 in
January (which has been paid along with its costs and interest) and
$1500 three weeks ago.

In addition, since 1999, I have settled four other claims prior to the
court dates for payments of $200, $269, $500 and $500.

Here are the small claims filings for the recent cases:

Plaintiff's Claim.  The defendant owes $1500 plus $19.00 court costs
for the following reason:

On 8 July 2002 at 2:56:39 pm, defendant initiated a telephone call to
my residential telephone line, 978 2xx-xxxx, using a pre-recorded voice
to deliver a commercial message without my prior express consent.
This is a violation of 47 USC 227(b)(1)(B).

47 USC 227(b)(3)(B) provides for a private right of action to receive
$500 damages for each such violation.  The court may increase the amount
of the award to $1500 "if the defendant willfully or knowingly violated
this subsection."

/s/ 27 July 2002

The clerk-magistrate awarded $500 (plus costs and interest), and in
this case the defendant has appealed to a Small Claims judge (paying
$129 to do so).  My response to the appeal may be read at
http://soapbox.covert.org/Pleading9-Dec-2002.txt -- it would be most
triumphant if the appeals court judge _increases_ the award to $1500.

And the other recent case:

Plaintiff's Claim:

Defendant owes $1000 plus $19 court costs for the following reasons:

On 24 Oct 2001 at 14:20 I received a telemarketing call for XYZ
on my home telephone number, 978 2xx-xxxx.  At that time I asked
to be put on the "do not call" list.  On 11 Dec 2001 at 10:32 I
received another telemarketing call for XYZ from the same call
center as before, and on 5 July 2002 at 10:45 I received a third
call.  A person who receives more than one telephone call within
twelve months is permitted by 47 USC 227 (c)(5) to bring a private
right of action for $500 for each such violation to an appropriate
court.

/s/ 27 July 2002

In this case I named both the Massachusetts company XYZ and their
contracted telemarketing call center in Kentucky as defendants.

The court awarded $1000 plus costs, $500 from XYZ and $500 from the
call center.  They have not appealed, and both have until 20 December
to pay, or must appear at a payment hearing in March, or be subject
to arrest.  I doubt I'll be able to collect the out-of-state award,
but after the March hearing I might turn the court documents over to
a Kentucky lawyer on a contingency basis, if I can find one willing.

I have three or four other cases that I am considering filing,
pending the results of the Mortgage Company's appeal.

%T   "Essentials of Data Communications"

There are many good, even classic, general telecommunications texts.
To be strictly fair, I should note only those published at the same
time as, or earlier than, the one I'm reviewing.  Even with that
proviso, I can still say that Tanenbaum's "Computer Networks" (cf.
BKCMPNWK.RVW), Stallings' "Data and Computer Communications" (cf.
BKDTCMCM.RVW), and Minoli's "Telecommunications Technology Handbook"
(cf. BKTLTCHB.RVW) all far exceed Stamper's work.  Even McNamara's
venerable "Technical Aspects of Data Communications" (cf.
BKTCHDCM.RVW) (from 1988) presents a superior picture of basic
communications technology.

Stamper does try to cover the fundamentals, but even his introduction,
in chapter one, is a confusing mix of foundational concepts and
irrelevant (and outdated) examples and applications.  Chapter two, on
the physical and data layers, is reasonable but limited.  The
discussion of networking, in chapter three, starts off much the same,
but soon wanders into trivia.  Chapter four, ostensibly about LANs,
contains a number of topics (such as backup) that have nothing to do
with communications at all, and chapter five seems to be an attempt to
duplicate the same material.  Chapters six to nine show some awareness
of basic concepts of networking and internetworking, but hidden in a
confused mass of verbiage and extraneous detail.  Some simplistic
thoughts on security and data communications applications finish the
book in chapter ten.

This work is noted to be an "integrated text and software package" on
the basis of some slide shows included on the accompanying disk.  The
slide shows basically reproduce some illustrations included in the
book (or, one might say, the book reprints all of the slides).  The
figures are as non-illuminating as all too many objects of the type.
However, when the "computer based training" tries to improve matters
with animations, the results are even worse.  Where the graphics are
simply incomprehensible (unless you already know what is going on),
the animations sometimes present material in erroneous ways, seeming
to present incorrect ideas and concepts.

This book is stated to be a course text.  Why anyone would choose it
over other available works is beyond my comprehension.

Well, I have no experience of Canadian traffic circles, or those
mentioned in Massachusetts -- Most of my driving in the U.S. has been
in the South and Mid-West.  Maybe where they *are* used in North
America the layout is better than here.

The idea of keeping traffic flowing sounds good, and quite probably
works in some places where traffic isn't too heavy and is reasonably
balanced from each road.  Unfortunately, there are many places here
where that isn't the case.  There are many "roundabouts" on the ring
road of my nearest big city (Norwich).  If you try entering one of
these from a side road during busy periods, you can sit there for
several minutes while a continuous stream of traffic pours in from the
ring road on your right.  You have to either hope that some kind
person will slow down to let you out or you have to see a gap you
think is big enough and go for it, hoping that those approaching will
slow down.  These are multi-lane roundabouts, by the way, and the
resulting game of "find the correct lane" as traffic goes around
results in many near misses, minor bumps, and frayed tempers.  Traffic
lights, if suitably timed/sensed, might hold up the main flow of
traffic for a short period, but would allow everybody a chance and
would eliminate the problems I've mentioned.

The problem is that in many relatively quiet surburban streets they've
also installed dozens of "mini-roundabouts."  These are places where a
simple 2-way stop, or better yet an American/Canadian-style 4-way stop
would be much better.

Most certainly.  The whole layout and design on North American roads makes 
for more relaxed driving.   Easier vision at intersections, wider roads, 
logical signs instead of the inconsistent mish-mash of British & Continental 
signs we have here, and so on.   I like the other touches, small but which 
make for keeping traffic moving:- Right turns on red and switching lights to 
flashing red & amber at night in quiet areas, for example.   The lower 
traffic density certainly helps as well!

O.K., I stand corrected.  I was looking at it from a purely
practical/technical point of view.  I have to confess that I've not
followed the policy behind the renumbering all that closely in recent
years (quite some time since I left BT).

I agree that at least the new numbering scheme (07xx=mobile,
08xx=free/low-rate, 09=premium etc.) for codes will be a vast
improvement on the situation which existed previously.  I still
believe that there are some things which could have been handled
better in this "grand plan" though.

Re the policy that when places outgrow 6-digit numbering plans they'll
go straight to 8 digits with 02x or 03x codes, when did this policy
come into effect exactly?  If this was to be the policy for future
expansion, then why were Reading, Bristol, Nottingham, et al moved to
7-digit numbering with 011n codes instead of going straight to 8-digit
local numbers?

In general though, I agree that the mess that has been made of changes
over the last few years is only now starting to be put straight.  The
hastily rushed split of London into 071 and 081 without thinking about
what would then need to be done a little farther down the track is an
excellent example of the lack of planning.

Maybe, but another practical reason is that when Ireland introduced
toll-free numbers they were already using 080 as a kludge for dialing
into Northern Ireland.  Now that 048 is used for that purpose, I
wonder whether they will re-organize to the "common" standard?  That
would involve a major upheaval to Irish codes.

Which brings us back to one of the key points made some time ago as to
the reason why the U.S. adopted 01+ and 011+ as special and sent-paid
IDDD codes.

Fair enough if they weren't told where the call terminated, I suppose.
But I don't see that that's any sort of valid argument for the NANP to
switch to 00+ for international dialing.

We can live in hope, but I'm not holding my breath!

That particular campaign was more honest than it might seem.  United
Tel really did buy Sprint, but then they adopted Sprint's name.  I
presume that was because Sprint was a heavily advertised brand name in
the competitive long distance market where customers can switch
easily, while United was only used for local service where there was
no competition at all.

But regardless of the name, the surviving company was United which was
(and is) a century old ILEC with a decent service reputation.

Hi Barry:

Thanks for the plug!  I think most prolific BBN'er for RFCs was Alex
McKenzie, who retired a while back. He has 61 RFCs to his credit.

Two small details to add to your story:

* We actually still have the router expertise at BBN.  We sold the product
  side, but not the research side.  So we team with vendors to help develop
  innovative new router (and encrypter) technology.  We like to say we're
  the leading router R&D center not affiliated with a single vendor.

* I believe that Genuity officially holds the BBN incorporation documents.
  When Genuity was spun off from GTE just before the Verizon merger,
  Genuity wanted a retirement and benefits plan in place.  Apparently
  retirement and benefits plans are tied to corporations and the easiest
  way to give Genuity a set of plans was to give it BBN as a shell
  company, and reincorporate BBN S&T as a Verizon-owned entity (with
  Verizon's retirement and benefit plans).

Thanks!

It is more than a matter of lying. It is the co-opting of a century of

Not a comparable situation by any means. The Giants stadium was built
with private money, a substantial portion of which came from PacBell
when it was owned by Pacific Telesis, a California corporation based
in San Francisco. For that substantial contribution to the community
in making the stadium possible in the first place, PacBell (not SBC)
was awarded the right to name the park through the year 2020.

Candlestick Park (as it is named now) simply sold the rights to the
name to the highest bidder long after the stadium was built, as
stadiums do around the country these days. That contract with 3Com has
since run out, and San Franciscans have decided, at least for now, to
keep the original name of the facility intact.

So now we blame the victims?

I've been online for over twenty years, and post prolifically to

And what about people who want to reply to my Usenet postings?  How do
they learn this "secret"?  That's why I refuse to use a fake address.
What's the point of having return addresses in Usenet headers if
everyone's just going to put useless addresses there.

Subject: MCI Once Again Ripping Off Customers
Date: Fri, 13 Dec 2002 00:23:06 -0600


MCI telephone service - charged for local toll calls when local calls
were still being billed by local phone company - need a refund - paid
$120 and still demanding more money.

I enrolled with MCI for about six months with their Local Toll Call
program for $29.95 a month and never received such service. I
ignorantly paid for about four months after several calls to MCI
customer service (to no avail) as the representative would just redo
my account to reflect the same program and again another month went by
that my local toll calls were still on my local phone company's
billing statement and MCI gets another $29.95 for doing absolutely
nothing.

Finally I switched to another company after receiving a "nasty gram"
from MCI in the mail every 3 weeks and at least 3 phone calls per week
demanding payment of 2 months service that I did not receive nor did I
ever receive but graciously handed MCI over about $120.00 for
absolutely nothing!

Now after being with the other company for about four months and a 3
way call between my local company and MCI to make them aware that they
were not my company of choice as I have received several letters
thanking me 1 day for my patronage to MCI and the next week another
demand for services not rendered.

Go figure. With all the problems MCI World Com is encountering about
fraud and misinformation and definitely mis-Communication with their
customer base you would think MCI would be grateful for my "donation"
for services never rendered and leave me alone with my new best
friend, another long distance carrier, that does their job and I get
satisfaction knowing my bills accurately reflect the services I have
chosen and receive.

I have written to MCI twice to their headquarters in Iowa and received
a lovely postcard saying "Sorry but we can't help you". Surprise!!

Where else can I turn to resolve this issue with a very
misrepresenting company that is constantly harrassing the consumer for
money owed to them for services they do not even attempt to give their
customers? Is the FCC listening to me because MCI obviously cannot
hear anything but "Cha-ching".

Recently United Airlines has started a new marketing campaign proudly
crowing they have been providing service for over 70 years.  This is
another of those claims by a company that didn't exist back then.
United was formed through the merger of several smaller carriers back
in the late 50's or early 60's.  Now if they can include the history
of the predecessors, then maybe their history will reach back that
far, but as a company, United didn't exist until the 7 smaller airline
companies merged to form a "United" company.

You make it sound like the naming rights were given to Pac*Tel out of
the goodness of the builders' hearts.  It would be considered gross
malfeasance if the naming rights were not assigned contractually in
exchange for some sort of consideration (i.e., sold).  They paid for
the naming rights, and the money was used to finance construction, a
straightforward commercial transaction.

In any case, it is customary for legal documents creating a
relationship of this sort to name parties in the form 'Pacific
Telesis, its successors and assigns'.  SBC is unquestionably the legal
successor or assign of Pacific Telesis. (Without a lot of costly
legal work, it would be difficult to tell precisely which.  In most
utility mergers I've heard about, the old corporation continues to
live on, as a paper tiger, for reasons which I suspect have to do with
state licensing laws.)

Xerox?

Unless you want to say that they are really Haloid; however, Haloid
simply changed their name to something brand new to reflect the brand
new thing they had gotten into.  There was no acquisition or co-opting
of anything or anyone else.  And yes, they still manufacture their own
products.  Design them all, too.  From scratch.

Coca-Cola?

Hardly a farce.  John, you do live in a world where that is by far the
rule, but wander outside your front yard a little and see that the
telecom industry *is* the exception by being the leader in this
co-opting and diluting of brand.

Ok, seriously. Let me think. 

Any of the Big Three auto companies, and yes, I AM including
DaimlerChrysler. In that case, there are two such names.

I'm sure I can come up with some others.

First, I've read more from John that I agree with than that I disagree
with. That said --

Let's see ... Concentrating on U.S. brands and firms that are close to
100 years old or older, excepting companies whose principal business has
fundamentally changed in that time (such as Wells-Fargo), and leaving
out toothpaste and mouthwash, the following come to mind:

Chevrolet, Ford, Chrysler, Mack, Harley-Davidson, Goodyear, Boeing,
Caterpillar, John Deere, Briggs & Stratton.

Quaker Oats (PepsiCo), Kellogg, Campbell Soup, Tastykake, Wrigley,
Coca-Cola, Pepsi Cola (PepsiCo), Hershey, Del Monte, Heinz, Nabisco
(part of Kraft), Kraft (part of Philip Morris), Philip Morris, Dole,
Hormel, Anheuser-Busch, Adolph Coors, McCormick.

Arm & Hammer (Church & Dwight), Ivory (Procter & Gamble), Clorox, Ball
(jars & cans), R.J. Reynolds, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson & Johnson,
Eli Lilly, Bausch & Lomb, Kleenex (Kimberly-Clark), Gillette, Levi
Strauss, Fruit of the Loom

A&P (The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company), Kroger, Walgreen's,
Macy's, Sears.

Kodak, DuPont, Sherwin-Williams, Corning, American Standard, Maytag,
General Electric, Emerson Electric, NCR (National Cash Register), Pitney
Bowes, Diebold, Scotch Brand (3M - Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing),
Steelcase, Smith & Wesson, Remington Arms, Steinway & Sons, Sealy,
Simmons.

McGraw-Hill, Hallmark, Dun & Bradstreet, The New York Times.

There are probably five times this many companies, and 50 times as
many brands that have a direct history of 100 years or more. If I only
have to look for a 50-year history, the lists would probably grow by a
factor of ten. If I look worldwide, probably another factor of ten.

There's a lot of business history and heritage out there. Many people
don't care much about it, so it doesn't get a lot of notice. As in
family circles, the outlandish arrangements and behaviors get far more
attention than the more conservative ones.

As I see the "SBC" getting bigger on their bills and envelopes compared to
the word "Ameritech," I am pretty sure that day is coming.

BUT until they tell us to make the checks out to "SBC" instead of
"Ameritech," they will be "Ameritech" to me.

As for "brand name," I think the sound of the word "Ameritech" is a
LOT more descriptive than some initials "SBC" which still brings back
memories of "southern."  When Ohio Bell, Michigan Bell, Illinois Bell,
etc., all came under one "roof," the company had the idea of maybe
expanding around the country.  They picked a name that reflected that
idea.  It had a "national" sound to it.

I think if they keep any name, it ought to be the one with the message
"America" in it.

I wonder how long Jacobs Field will keep its name.  (That's
Cleveland's baseball stadium.)  When Mr. Jacobs is long gone and they
need new money for repairs or remodeling, they will probably give it a
new name the same way they did that college downtown whose name I
can't remember since they stopped calling it Dyke College.

It may have been a "going business" at the time, but several Wall
Street analysts had Pacific Telesis as being about 18 months away from
bankruptcy at the time of the merger with SBC.  It still had a very
bloated management structure, with the corporate culture to match
(remember, this was the company that spawned "Dilbert"), and they were
getting fined by the CPUC for missing performance targets on a regular
basis.  No matter what else you say about SBC, they turned all those
things around, and, in the process, hired several hundred additional
people in the repair centers and customer service centers.

I think that you'd get a different story from the state PUCs in
Wisconsin, Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, and especially Illinois.  Prior to
the merger with SBC, they were all rating Ameritech's service as "fair
to poor", with millions of dollars in fines being assessed each month.
Customer service still isn't perfect, but, under SBC's management,
they're a lot closer to meeting those performance targets each month.

It's recently come out that Ameritech was in a lot worse shape than
Notabaert and company let on during the "due diligence" portion of the
merger process, and that SBC has had to spend huge amounts to
straighten out that part of the company in the last couple of years.

What utter nonsense. AFAICT, the greatest feature of the Internet is
the ability to create virtual communities. A critical means of
creating those communities is the ability to communicate via e-mail.

Any sort of obfuscation fo e-mail addresses is an impediment to the
free communication on the Internet. And this leads to one of the great
ironies: spammers, who often claim that they have the right to Free
Speech on the Internet, have performed possibly-irreparable damage to
true free speech and discussion over e-mail on the Internet.

> http://www.forbes.com/2002/12/12/cx_ah_1212tentech.html

I'm saddened by these pieces in reputable magazines that launch up
disinformation to the public.

Recently, the Wall Street Journal had a front-page article claiming
that spamming for some items was OK while spamming for others isn't.
Apparently, the writer never ever heard of The Ebert Pledge ( which
you can see at http://www.panix.com/~tbetz/boulder.shtml ).

It also mis-labeled opt-in e-mails as spam. All in all, the article
muddled clearly-understood definitions and concepts. And this was from
a newspaper that typically has thoroughly-researched and well-written
articles on a vast variety of business topics.

The battle for spam is being fought in the media right now.

This kind of crap kicks my blood pressure right up. How about "The
next time a crazed sniper takes a shot at you, if you survive, you
might want to consider that you were ultimately responsible for your
brush with death: you were the one who stopped at a service station
for fill your gas tank, drove to the mall, went to school or otherwise
gave the gunner a chance to get you in his sights." The response to
attacks on people and property should be to do something about
miscreants, not to tell all the law-abiding people to lock themselves
up out of harm's way.

This is a really a perfect example of the market at work -- the same

even feed them information, can now sell you tools to "protect" yourself.

This appears to be regulation fare for those who have been on the net
for any period of time. I've probably got two dozen or so addresses
that all point to my one emailbox. If it were not for the fact that I
use very aggressive spam filtering, I would have at least 100 spams a
day, and have had that many and more per day in the past.

Some of my most lucrative projects have come from folks who saw a
posting and sent email as a result. I would never munge my email
address, although I do use one that is not attractive to address
harvesters. The only side effect that has occurred relates to
occasional accusations from folks who declare that my email address is
invalid without ever trying it.

What nonsense. This is analogous to saying I should rent a post office

my PO box gets full, I should rent another one.

Or, that I should move when the junk mail load to my house gets too

All you need to do to get on spammers' lists is to publish an RFC.  I
regularly got spams addressed to email addresses on systems which haven't
existed for well over a decade, but which were on old RFCs.  Stanford was
very kind to have MX records and forwardings for these old addresses, but
I ended up asking them to delete them.

Exactly right.  And if you publish RFCs, your email is going to become
public knowledge anyway.

Then there's the spammers who run dictionary attacks on a server.  My ISP
gave me a free email account on their server, even though I run my own
email server.  Within a couple of hours of it being opened, the first
spams had arrived.

However, there is something to the argument that we are in some way
responsible.  In the old days, we very much resented the governing
authority held over us by first ARPA, then DCA, and finally NSFnet.
We said that what we wanted was anarchy.  We were severely punished
for this impudence by being given the very thing that we demanded.

Anarchy does not result in the peaceful, primitive communism of fantasy.

Anarchy results in warlords, walled cities, and frequently-plundered
villages.

The situation will continue to deteriorate until we are granted an
effective governing authority with enforcement power.  When that
wonderful day finally comes, we will once again resent the stupid laws
that the governing authority will inevitably hold over us.  And, at
least for a while, we will resent it with pleasure and joy, for we
will no longer need to deal with walls, or fear being plundered by
warlords.

I heartily agree with Gordon.   

I can see the advantages of call waiting in some situations, maybe
teenagers on the phone for two hours at a time or something like that,
but in general I don't like the system.  Do you take a second incoming
call or not?

If you ignore the new caller, chances are that when he gets around to
calling back you'll get an offended-sounding "Why didn't you answer my
call?  Didn't you hear the call-waiting beeps?"

Take the second call and you risk offending the first person.  Even if
you intend to just tell the new caller that you'll return his call
when you're done, it's easy to end up taking longer than you plan and
have the original call held for a while.  And if you only ever intend
to answer the second call with a "I'll call back when I'm free,"
what's the point?  Let the second call get a busy signal and he'll try
again in a few minutes anyway.

A busy signal gets my vote every time.

Pagers and voicemail are poxes on society. Call Waiting is a godsend.

I was visiting my parents for Thanksgiving, and my mother was telling
the story of how she came to have Call Waiting. It was about 1975. My
brother and I were both in junior high. Our house was quite near the
elementary school and the high school, but some distance from the
junior high school. We had gone to some after-school activity, with
instructions to call home for a ride when we were done. Mom was on the
phone, though, chatting away with a friend, oblivious to the passing
time. My brother and I called and got a busy signal. We waited a few
minutes and tried again. We kept trying for the better part of an
hour.  We finally gave up and walked home. Mom was flabbergasted when
we walked in the door, and she only then realized that her
conversation (which was still going) had blocked her from receiving an
important call. Without Call Waiting, she had no way to know that we
were trying to reach her.

Voicemail would have been useless in that situation, even if it had
been available, because she wouldn't've known that she had a message
until after she hung up -- and in most cases not until she picked up
the phone again later and heard the stutter dialtone. Suggesting that
my mother carry a pager is not viable.

As my mother said, about the most isolated you can be in modern society
is to be on the phone without Call Waiting.

Of course, I'm very happy to have Cancel Call Waiting, especially now
that my switch allows me to do it in the middle of a call. Where my
parents now live, they can't get CCW, because they are victims
("customers") of the Great Telephone Experiment, d.b.a. Verizon.

On my switch, I can dial *70 (or 1170) on an outgoing call. I can also
flash in the middle of a call (as long as there isn't a call waiting)
and dial *70, returning me to my conversation as soon as I get the
confirmation tone. All is as it should be, except for the pesky little
detail that I have to wait until the confirmation tone is done before I
dial any further digits. If I dial *70-555-0123 instead of
*70W-555-0123, my call may fail.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I agree completely with Linc. Our call
waiting tone here is *only* heard by the person who has it on the
line (the other party gets a very short loss in voice *if* the other
end is speaking; nothing if he himself is doing the speaking) and ours
works just like Linc suggests:  *70 before beginning a call you
originate, or flashhook *70 during a call you receive if you wish to
do it. It is indeed a godsend, and used liberally in a proper way, 
there is no reason to be offensive to anyone. Of course, if you use
it too often, telco may wonder why you bothered to buy the feature
at all. PAT]

Yes, it was. Which means that the ANdrews 4 exchange has existed from 
the creation of the 408 area code, in which it remains even today.

By the way, allow me to correct a minor error: the central office is
SJ14, not SJ12. I'm always confusing the ANdrews office with the

Subject: Re: Being Online Without a Hard Drive


Hi Pat,

If you chose to post this on the 'net _PLEASE_ delete my real email
adddress first.  I've had the same email adx for over two years and
_no_ spam.  I like it that way.  I sympathize with your situation, but
you have to have your name out there and there is no alternative.
Please don't post my email adx on the net.

I saw your message ( below ) and felt I needed to comment.  I am doing
the same thing here, but I use a different CD distribution.  I'm using
something called the Sentry Firewall CD-ROM (www.SentryFirewall.com)
which is amaziningly freely available on the 'net.  This is a complete
Linux OS on a CD, and when it boots it completely bypasses whatever is
on the hard drive.

They anticipated your problem with configuration.  The CD naturally
has none of your personal email names, passwords, dialup numbers or
any of the other stuff you need to connect.  Instead, they use a
floppy disk which is read in after the Linux OS boots.  This provides
all you need to get connected.

However, I found this tedious on a laptop.  I too have a USB "disk
drive" device.  Mine is called a "DiskOnKey", but it works the same.
In fact there are several different brands of similar devices
available now.  I wanted to use mine as a substitute for the floppy
drive, but there is a problem.

Your ( and my ) PC BIOS doesn't know how to deal with a USB disk
drive.  It can deal with USB keyboards, and USB mice, but not USB
disks.  Thus, _you cannot boot from a USB disk_.  Period.  Can't be
done unless you know how to rewrite a BIOS, burn a chip and install it
in your computer.

Thus, your stradegy of moving everything to the Fuji device (FujiDisk?)
won't work.  You need to boot the CD to get going, and then read the
setup information from the FujiDisk.  As implied from your message,
the KNOPPIX CD doesn't know how to do this.  As it happens, neither
did the Sentry CD.  But, since Sentry is a Linux OS, open system, and
they encourage users to adapt and adopt their system to your
requirements, modifing the Sentry disk was possible.  Not easy, but
possible.

What I had to do was to recompile the Linux kernel on the Sentry disk
to "find" the USB disk _after_ it booted, and then tell the
application what to do with the info found there.  Fortunately, Linux
allows you to define the boot process and insert your own
configuration as you wish.  The result is a bootable CD with a
complete Linux system, and a USB disk with all my personal ID (email
name, ISP, passwords, dialups etc.) on the USB disk.  Since the CD
has no personal information on it, I can leave it in the machine.  As
long as I take the USB disk with me, no one can get my personal ID.
And, since I formatted the USB disk with a Linux filesystem, you can't
even read it on a Windows machine.

I also modified the boot process to give the user a choice of which
OS to boot.  (Linux is clever).  So, even with the Linux CD in the
machine, I can tell it to ignore the CD and boot the normal Windows
from the hard drive.  Thus, leaving the CD in the machine is totally
transparent.

I don't know if the KNOPPIX CD can be arranged this way.  If not, I
suggest that you take a look at the Sentry CD.  It at least already
has the floppy disk configuration system, and if you find this works
for you, I can give you further guidance if you want to use the USB
disk instead.

Pat, you're doing a great job.  Keep up the good work.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Oooh, how I wish I still had my Melco
PBX which I used for a few years in Chicago. It was ideal for a small
business application. Two incoming/outgoing ports by dialing 9, up to
12 extensions (numbered 21 through 32) with incoming calls defaulting
to extension 21 (which also served as '0'), 'call forwarding' between
extensions (and extension 21 [which was also '0'] for incoming calls
could be forwarded as well to answering machines, etc), a 'do not
disturb' mode on each extension, other features, including call
waiting and a paging mode by dialing (I think) '4'. I was told several
years ago that Melco went out of the telephone PBX business. :(  Does
anyone make little devices like that anymore that you simply hook

Subject: Best Kid Safe Software Filter?
Date: 13 Dec 2002 13:59:51 -0800

A while back I checked out many of the kid safe (kidsafe and kid-safe)
internet filtering software for Internet Explorer. Some are very large
and complex, and costly. And after the Trial install/uninstall, most
leave remnants of themselves hanging around my system.

What's the latest, best (ie., cleanest, simplest [kiss], reasonably
priced)  out there these days?

Thanks in advance! 

 ...Concerned Parent

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: No matter how well-intentioned any sort
of kid-safe filtering program is, it invariably makes mistakes in its
choices of what to eliminate. Nothing, IMO (look, no 'H' in there;
that's because I do not give humble opinions) takes the place of a
good parent who keeps his/her eyes constantly on what a child is doing
with a computer in the kid's private space, like a bedroom. With your
child, the best place for the computer is in a family room or other
area where parents come and go all the time and are prone to asking
questions about what the child is doing; who is that he is chatting
with, etc. A computer should be a family investment, not a child's
curiosity toy ... if a child is afraid that something he sees or
reads on the computer is likely to bring mom or dad into the area
and slap him silly, he won't be as likely to see or read that material.

And education for children is very important also. Let them know a few
things, as age appropriate, about your own values, and how you wish
to teach those values to the children. Let them know that just as in
real life, walking down the street for example, they are going to see
and read things on the net which are not part of your values or life
style. For example, no matter how hard you try, your children are
going to eventually have a school assignment to learn about USA gover-
ment and the White House. They are NOT going to learn about the White
House by reviewing http://whitehouse.com for example. That's where a
parent has to explain something about personal values. You might want
to look at http://internet-history.org and click on the pages dealing
with challenges to read about this topic more. 

Buy any kind of kid-safe software you like and can afford. Also look
at the possibility of an email account for the child in the newly
planned .kids domain or the .kids.us domain which is already
around. But whichever way you go, be prepared for the challenge of a
lifetime in bringing the child up in this new era we now live in. PAT]

Because they were implemented under the old, now discredited, policy.

While they appeared to be using 080 for that purpose, they were only
using those parts of the number space that corresponded to the code
as dialled from within the UK.  And as the prefix "00" was not used
in the UK for inland calls (it was the prefix for international calls
from 16 April 1995) then similarly the prefix 0800 was never required
for dialling into Northern Ireland from the Republic of Ireland!

The technique of treating level "0" in a different manner is fairly
common: for example, within New Zealand "09" is the code for Auckland,
but no Auckland numbers begin with a "0": so this does not conflict
with their concurrent use of 0900 for premium-rate/audiotex services.

Everything else in the RoI is "standard" (well, unless you believe
011 to be standard - but that was where we came in!): a while back
they introduced "00" for International (it used to be "16") and
"0" has always been the prefix for their geographic/mobile codes.
What some would consider NON-standard in the RoI are the access
codes for non-geographic (shared cost and premium rate) services:
for which, like Freefone, suitable 1xxx codes have been assigned.

I would be surprised if the Irish regulator ComReg decided to change
the existing arrangements, which were very clearly chosen to avoid
any conflict or confusion with numbers in the UK's scheme which are
advertised on Press, Radio and TV with overlapping footprints.

Since "080" is no longer used to call Northen Ireland, ComReg has
designated that access code for Fixed Line Mailbox Services, in which
each individual customer subscriber number has a directly associated
mailbox number: this means that to reach such a mailbox a caller from
within the Republic would dial "08" before the customer's number, and
a caller from outside would dial +353 80 and the customers' number.

A little devil's advocacy here:

The vast majority of all international calls I have placed while
travelling outside the NANP (whether calling back to the U.S. or
calling a third country), I have placed as sent-paid calls from
payphones, dialing direct. Most countries have far more reasonable coin
sent-paid rates for international calls than the rates prevalent in the
U.S. I quite enjoyed being able to make a transatlantic call for less
than a dime [USD$0.10], even if the call was limited to a few seconds.
It was still enough time to say, "Hi, Mom, I'm fine. Bye."

Also, if UIFN ever really takes off, then we might see many more
visitors to the NANP wanting to dial +800, even from payphones.

However, I have never had any difficulty finding out or remembering the
appropriate code to dial, whether it was 00, 010, 0011, or whatever.
Indeed, as to the difficulty of finding such information, it's
prominently featured in every tourist guide book I've seen in many
years. Each book has a little section on practical matters, telling you
such things as how to change money, how to find a doctor or pharmacist,
how best to mail things home (from postcards to packages), and how to
dial the telephone. If you're going to travel in a foreign country, you
do have to make *some* effort to learn the particulars, and I see
nothing wrong with that. Indeed, that is part of the *point* of going
to a foreign country. Personally, I don't travel overseas without a
guide book and a phrase book (if English is not the primary language).

In particular, if you're a foreign visitor in the U.S., not knowing the
IDDD prefix is the *LEAST* of your worries if you want to phone home.
Of much greater importance is the matter of how to spot the trustworthy
phone cards from the scams. There are plenty of deals like $0.01/minute
to anywhere in the world [tiny print: maximum call duration 3 minutes;
$9.99 connection fee applies per call; some countries excluded]. Of
course, that assumes that the card (or better yet, the card issuer)
hasn't already expired before you buy it.

With T-mobile (GSM service), one actually dials the plus symbol (on

code, area code, number.  I can dial +1212xxx-yyyy to get to NYC, or
+612 xxxx xxxx to get to Australia.  To get to Minnesota, I dial +1612
xxx-yyyy.  (Or, from within the US, I can dial just 1612xxxyyyy or
even just 612xxxyyyy.)

But once again, the US is a problem, because it's VERY hard to get an
actual operator.  And even if you do get an operator, it might be the
WRONG operator.  Dial 0?  Dial 00?  Dial 00, then listen to the
prompt, then dial 0 again??  Yes.  That's what you do to get an
operator here.

The problem isn't so much a libel case in Australia, as a libel case
in a country where, for instance, truth is no defense against
libel. In the entire civilized world (including both the US and
Australia), we take that protection for granted, but there are many
countries where it isn't so, especially if the defamation is against a
government official or agency.

Turkey's entrance into the EU is currently stalled because of (among
many issues) legal provisions that allow criminal prosecution for
criticizing the government, even if the criticism is accurate, and
that's one of the milder examples. (It is also a crime in Turkey to
advocate the peaceful political separation of the Kurdish region from
the rest of the country, or even to broadcast in the Kurdish language,
irrespective of what you say. It's going to be a very LONG time before
Turkey joins the EU, Dubya's ham-handed pressure notwithstanding.)

In any case, the Australian court made an egregious error in this
case.  It is entirely unreasonable to hold that merely because someone
viewed a web page in a particular jurisdiction, that such viewing
constitutes "publication" in any sense of the word. The pre-Internet
analogy would be to try someone for defamation in Australia because a
magazine published in New Jersey was carried by a passenger on an
airplane to Australia, where someone read it and took umbrage. Even if
you take the analogy of a person in Australia ordering a magazine from
New Jersey, that still doesn't make the magazine "published" in
Australia.  Publication in a particular jurisdiction *MUST* be held to
be an intentional act in that jurisdiction.

In no way did Dow Jones "publish" in Australia. At most, they delivered
goods and/or services, published in New Jersey, to an address which
they may not even have had any way of knowing was in Australia.

Dow Jones doubtless has some sort of physical presence in Australia,
and probably even in Victoria. However, smaller Internet publishers
should be concerned about the possibility of having some other
jurisdiction apply its laws to you. A cornerstone of the judicial
system is the notion that a case must be tried either in the place
where the alleged wrong occurred, or in the defendant's jurisdiction.
If it is held that the act of having someone view your web page
constitutes publication in the jurisdiction of viewing, then any
random person could compel you to travel halfway across the planet to
defend yourself against a lawsuit. That's frightening even if it's
Australia, but much moreso with a number of other countries.

No, nor will there ever be such a resource. The cellular companies
guard that data as proprietary -- after all, if you knew where the
holes were, you might switch to another carrier! (umm, yeah)

There are some web sites that compile user reports of dead zones,
though, and the cellular companies can't do anything to stop that.

Try a search on Google for "cellular dead zones".

The NVM is a standalone PC running OS/2 Warp. It is terribly
overpriced, as are all voicemail systems. Not only is the NVM
overpriced, it's also underfeatured as compared to 3rd party
systems. I would definitely compare the NVM with 3rd party
systems. AVT (I believe they've been bought up by someone now) had a
great voicemail system in '95 when I was working on it. And it used
Dialogic voice cards that simulated Norstar digital sets, so you
didn't need analog ports, and the digital integration worked
flawlessly.

What no one has mentioned in discussing the comparative mertits of

When I got my (pre-pay) phone from Verizon, I had my choice of any of
three reasonably local area-codes: 845/914/201.  The cell companies
don't seem to care where your phone is or what your area code is.

The days of LD-rates that varied with area-code are also long gone.  

Furthermore, many localities already have to dial 10 or eleven digits
to make a local phone call.

I wonder how long it will be before we get rid of area codes that
reflect localities.  As nearly as I can tell, only one benefit of
knowing where an area code is remains: you know what time zone the
number is in.

Cell phone subscribers will see their monthly bills go up next spring
because of changes in how the government charges phone companies to
underwrite services for rural areas and the poor.

The Federal Communications Commission decided Friday almost to double
the amount major wireless phone companies pay to the fund used to keep
phone connections affordable in low-income and high-cost areas. That
fund also helps connect schools and libraries to the Internet.

    NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Hughes Electronics Corp.  (NYSE:GMH),
the top U.S. satellite television operator, said on Friday it would
shut down its loss-making high-speed Internet business, three days
after it and No. 2 rival EchoStar Communications Corp. (NYSE:DISH)

    DirecTV Broadband, which operates the DirecTV DSL service, had
160,000 subscribers to its Internet service over telephone lines, but

million to $120 million.

Subject: AT&T Wireless Fine Print Irks Customers


By Alorie Gilbert
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
December 13, 2002, 4:00 AM PT

Some customers of AT&T Wireless are being hit with unexpectedly high 
bills when their plans expire, the result of a little-known clause 
buried within their contracts.

Wireless plans are notoriously complicated, to the point that some
companies have run ad campaigns touting their own simplicity while
mocking other companies' tangled contracts. In the latest example, an
easily overlooked detail in AT&T Wireless bills is generating a fresh
round of customer complaints.

Some AT&T Wireless customers are learning the hard way that the 
extras they received when they signed up for service, such as bonus 
minutes, no longer apply when their one-year contracts expire. As a 
result, people who think they're calling within the allotted minutes 
of their plan, are instead charged additional per-minute fees.

Pacific Bell may be taking on a new name, but it's still up to the 
same old tricks.

The company's customers were outraged when I wrote how Pac Bell, which
now wants to be known by the moniker of its corporate parent, SBC,
slipped an insert into recent bills advising that personal information
will be shared with business partners unless the customer says
otherwise.

That's not the half of it. For some services, Yahoo says it will
request Pac Bell customers' Social Security number "and information
about your assets."

The online company says it will track DSL subscribers' Internet 
browsing and share personal information with "trusted partners." Such 
info will be used in part "to customize the advertising and content 
you see."

"Once you create an SBC Yahoo account and sign in to our services, you
are not anonymous to us," Yahoo warns in surprisingly stark language.

The geek-driven world of new "decentralized" technologies like Wi-Fi, 
blogging and Web services is more about cutting out the middleman 
than finding a business model.

By Scott Rosenberg

Dec. 13, 2002 | The technology industry has long been shaped by the
creative tension between technologists and businesspeople, otherwise
known as geeks and suits. Geeks make new stuff primarily because it's
fun, because it's useful, and because they can. Suits make new stuff
primarily because they hope to earn a profit. Yes, that is an
oversimplification, and there's overlap between the two types -- there
are plenty of profit-seeking geeks and geeky business folks.  Still,
the distinction is real.

You'd think that, today, with the tech industry in its worst downturn
in memory, jobs scarce and funding scarcer, bottom-line thinking would
dominate. Instead, the recent cratering of so many companies seems to
have chastened the suits -- and the very absence of get-rich-quick
opportunities has cleared a space for geek enthusiasms to flourish.

I never argued that SBC did not have the LEGAL right to name the stadium

Those are all merely holding companies for many times that number of

the company named on the label, but now are made in generic plants
that make products for competing "brands" as well.

The history and heritage is in your mind (as the companies would
like).  Sure, they are all household names, but they have
cross-traded, spun-off, merged to the point where you could probably
not possible trace any sort of lineage. But more importantly, they
don't actually make their own products anymore. Who cares what "brand"
is stamped on the products emerging from any given ISO 9660 plant?

And don't forget the San Francisco Chronicle, which is really the San 
Francisco Examiner (staff-wise, anyway). The San Francisco Examiner is 
now nothing more than a shopping rag. The banners of both papers claim 
existence back into the eighties, but neither paper has any real claim 
to that history.

I rest my case.

Actually, SBC decimated the service from Pacific Bell. Their first act
was to shut down the "advanced digital network" that Pacific Bell (a
much more forward-thinking company under Pacific Telesis than SBC ever
was) was using to replace its aging copper plant. That meant that
customers that had already been switched to the fiber network had to
be put back on ancient copper. In fact, in some areas, like my
neighborhood, they had to install new cabling throughout because there
were not enough reclaimable pairs in the legacy plant. It was a very
stupid move on SBC's part. But then, they do everything like they do
in San Antonio.

> So the extensive DSL capability simply appeared out of thin air?

Extensive? More people cannot get DSL in Silicon Valley than can get
it ... even today. Perhaps I could tell you about the Program Services
department that cannot install equalized lines now no matter how hard
they try. Or the blase attitude about T1s. The old PacBell would
dispatch day or night on a hicap circuit. I've got one in trouble
right now that has been suffering for days. Or how about the fact that
they cannot seem to keep them working in the first place? None of this
was a problem before the Texans came in and fired all the people who
knew how.

The exact opposite has happened in California. We used to get
knowledgable techs who could make things happen. Now, we get
disgruntled folks who just haven't found a better job yet who go
through the motions. When you dialed 611, you got someone who wrote up
a repair order. Now you get a time-wasting, convoluted recording that
ultimately tells you that the problem is at your end and then says
"goodbye". Or CSRs that are more interested in selling you lucrative
feature packages than making the changes you want on the account or
answering your questions. Oh, yeah ... service is REALLY better now with
SBC.

My heart bleeds. I would give anything to have a telco run by
Californians again.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Just a couple comments. The Chicago 
Tribune (as a newpaper) began in June, 1847. The fellow who started
it back then ran into some financial problems early on and sold it
a couple years later. Around 1860, they formed the Chicago Tribune
Company (they had a 'company' all along of course, but around 1860
made it a formal thing.) When the C.T. Company started, the newspaper
was its product. They began picking up other products as they went
along, including a fledgling radio station operation in 1921, which
they called WGN at 720 kc on the AM dial, since after all, the 
Chairman of their board at that time, Colonel McCormick did believe
he had the <W>orld's <G>reatest <N>newspaper. A few years after that,
in 1928, they built their huge skyscraper in downtown Chicago on
Michigan Avenue, and moved all their operations in there. 

Two other Chicago newspapers (Chicago American and Chicago Herald, 
which was a Hearst publication) merged in the 1930's and before too
long, the combined product (called the Chicago Herald-American) was
bought from Hearst by Colonel McCormick and it operated in the Tribune
Towers Building (along with the Tribune) until I think about 1967.
It was folded when McCormick wanted to start a new afternoon newspaper
called 'Chicago Today' to compete with the Chicago Daily News, which
by that time was the afternoon version of the Chicago Sun-Times, but
considered editorially independent. (The Chicago Sun and The Chicago
Times had merged in 1941 to become the Chicago Sun Times, which was
Colonel McCormick's biggest threat). With their aquisition of the
Daily News around 1958 or so, the Tribune had some catching up to do.
By the way, the Daily News was started in 1878 by Victor Lawson (of
Lawson YMCA fame [a 1928 endowment by him to the Young Men's Christian
Association of Metropolitan Chicago, which took the money and built
a new YMCA residence in his name]). Once afternoon newspaper publishing
got to be an economic nightmare, the Sun-Times folded the Daily News
in the afternoon, and the Tribune gave up on Chicago Today. Now in 
the past few years, both of Chicago's major papers have stuck their
toes in that water again, with afternoon editions of their own. 

In more recent years when that Australian guy owned the Sun Times,
*he* used that tenuous connection back to the old Daily News days as
his rationale for 'this paper has been around for more than a
century', and the corporate executives of the Tribune Company almost
soiled their underwear when they read that in the paper one
day. Anyway, the Tribune Company in recent years still has the Tribune
newspaper of course, the radio/television/ media conglomerate, and
Freedom Center, the huge printing plant on the Chicago River (on the
river, so they can get their boatloads of newsprint from Canadian
forests they own, and chop down for not only the Tribune, but the
several suburban newspapers they print each day, the satellite
editions of the Wall Street Journal and the Christian Science Monitor,
and a couple other general interest magazines they publish for the
magazines' owners/publishers.) The last I heard, they were trying to
'steal' Readers Digest from the R.R. Donnelly Company, which in
addition to printing every telephone book in the world, has two huge
presses devoted 24/7 to printing up X-jillion copies of Readers Digest
each month. That's the Chicago Tribune Company, which began in 1847.

My second point today in this somewhat long note:  SBC has 'proudly'
served Independence since about the start of the 1900's under the
name Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, which name still graces the
local central office building (and former business office as well)
over at 6th and Maple Streets. They 'proudly' offer us all DSL as
long as we live close enough to the CO ... but that's not a big
problem for 95 percent of our town, two miles long and a mile and
a half wide. The only people here in town who cannot get DSL service
(if they want it) are the people in the 'rich part of town' north
of Taylor Road; that little section called 'country club'. When the
CO was built around 1900, it was located in the main part of town
which is where I live (southeast area) which was all there was to
Independence back in those days. PAT]

If this were true, dialing plans would have a check-digit in place.
The idea is that, given an 8-digit number, if you mis-dial one and
only one number you don't get a working number at all.  THAT would
drastically reduce the number if misdialed numbers.

In the US the caller has no way to know whether the called party has
call-waiting and ignoring it, or whether no one is home, the phone is
broken, or is being unanswered for some other reason.

Conceivably, some time after the called party has ignored the second beep,
the exchange could play a busy signal instead of ring signal (this would
probably be about 10 rings), but I haven't been in a situation where I
could find out if it does that.  I suspect, however, that it doesn't.

> Paul Coxwell,
> Norfolk, U.K.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: And in fact, that *does* happen in many
central offices, particularly if you are calling long distance. Here
in Independence at least, if you allow a phone to ring unanswered for
about three minutes, the ringing will stop and a recorded message of
an impatient lady comes on saying 'the number is not going to answer
now. Try again later.' And with that, you are cut off. A nightly talk
show on the radio uses the number 800-322-5385. The announcer at the
start of the show says, 'allow the phone to keep ringing; we will
answer when we are ready to take your call ...' and that may be five
or ten minutes. Uh, uh ... not according to SWB it won't be five or
ten minutes; about three minutes of ringing is the limit. I can see
what the radio is trying to do; trying to keep a lid on their own
toll free charges phone bill, but that won't work according to AT&T
and Southwestern Bell.  You then have to hang up after you hear that
recording start and immediatly redial to reach the show. But chances
are likely someone else then beats you to the draw, and *they* get to
sit there three minutes listening to ringing (you get a busy signal)
before *they* get cut off and you (on your frantic redial attempts)
get back in for another three minutes of waiting again.   PAT]

A real (non-SBC) telco would see those potential country club customers 
and install a fiber hut right in the middle of it and equip it with 
DSLAMs. But, as all the field techs say to me now, "SBC hates fiber." 
Too bad, since puting a fiber hut out there would improve the POTS 
service as well.

But as I read the SBC webpage, the company is only interested in making 
its REAL customers (the shareholders) happy. The paying users of the 
service are just a necessary evil.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Funny you should mention it. My doctor,
(who lives in that part of town, although his practice is in the
center of town across the street from Mercy Hospital, says he has
tried to get DSL for a couple years, but SWB says it is not available
'up there'. However, in one of my walks around town last summer, I
passed an open field a few blocks from the high school (around 15th
and Oak Streets) which has a large fence around it with a sort of
junky shed there with a lot of junk on the side of it, a bunch of
microwave dish parts laying on the ground, and a sign on the fence
warning against trespassing and that violators will be prosecuted,
signed Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. Not SBC, mind you,
Southwestern Bell Telephone Company. One day I saw an actual telephone
truck parked outside (but in the grounds there.) No one seems to know
what it is for. But it does not come close to resembling the beautiful
old antique central office building downtown which years ago also had
a business office of the first floor. I always see trucks in their
parking area also.  The high school is up in that general area north
side of town.

Oh, and terraworld, our local ISP and *their* new competitive phone
company claim to have DSL available, but three guesses who they get
the 'last mile' of it from.  It turns out their new competitive phone
company has its business office in the Independence Corporate Center
Building downtown, but *their* CO is in SWBell's building on 6th and
Maple Streets.  PAT]

For spam traceroute the spam AND the website being spamvertised and

For credit card thingies with the postage paid return envelope just
pack it all back in that (including their original envelope) and put a

Yes, except it was the late 1920s and early 1930s, which would be --

John, I've agreed with you much more than not -- but on this one, you're
completely wrong.  I didn't say you were living in a dream world; I said
that through your work you live in a world where national branding IS a
farce.  But don't, by ANY means, extend that to all of business as a
whole -- or even a majority of business.

It's the rule in your world, but your world is the exception in the
business world.  The telecom world is a small, small piece of the
business pie.  You're seeing the world through telecom-colored
glasses.  It's time to take those glasses off and see the world for
what it is, instead of what you seem to think it is.

I didn't say they were good. Ameritech screwed the pooch when they laid
off thousands of workers who actually had a clue. 

Remember Michael Kellner, an IT guy and middle manager who ended up on
page one of the Plain Dealer's Metro section in a story about all of
the layoffs? You probably don't. I do. Michael Kellner is the father
of a close friend of mine. The interesting thing is that his son was
dating the daughter of an Ameritech lineman -- I don't recall any of
the linemen getting laid off, just the middle management.

It hurt them, I think. They already sucked at that point.

SBC made things much, much worse.

I'm talking about working for an ISP and getting lots of nasty calls
from customers thinking we were leaving town after the flaming idiots
turned off all of our dialup lines -- all people got were messages
that the lines were disconnected.

I'm talking about being past due on a bill and calling to make payment
arrangements, and being told that to avoid disconnection I had to pay
the past due amount PLUS the amount on the CURRENT BILL that they had
just mailed out TWO DAYS AGO that I hadn't even received yet! (They
backed off after I yelled at them.)

I'm talking about, this year, ordering Ameritech DSL (because I can't
get my own DSL here; Ameritech is the only company offering it out of
my CO) -- and having someone accidentally install a loop on our line --
a bridge tap - which caused so much static that not only was I without
DSL, I couldn't make a voice call or receive a voice call! (As I
mentioned to many people, it's a good thing I didn't have to call 911
at any time during the outage). Then I had to fight for credits to my
account.

SBC is finally getting a little better, and most of the front-line
phone employees I talk to at the Ameritech Ohio office in Cleveland
seem like they at least want to help. But it's too little, too late.
My one-year committment to the DSL expires on 12/17, and Adelphia just
started offering cablemodems here. I'm posting this over my cablemodem
right now. DSL gets dumped first, then later in the week the Ameritech
account gets switched to CoreComm.

Which is my major beef with so called USF charges.  The LD companies
such as AT&T see that because the government gives them permission to
charge for USF they can charge any rate they like and if their
revenues are down all they have to do is adjust up the USF rate that
it will charge it's subscribers no matter that it may just be an
arbitrary rate.  Why does AT&T charge 11% while ECC might only charge
5%?  Why?  Probably because they can pretty much charge whatever they
like and have no federal mandate that they pass along the actual
amount that is due.  The same probably goes for the surcharge the
receiver of a toll-free call.  The rate is only 30 cents or so, but
carriers charge anywhere from 30 cents to 55 cents.  Charge whatever
the traffic will bear is what it appears.

True for modern times, but as has been mentioned already, in the old
network there *were* U.K. STD codes starting 00.  I don't have an old
list here, so I don't know if any such codes were actually used in
N.I.

I'm not sure when Ireland introduced 1800 (and 1850 etc.).  Even
though it was probably long after the British 00nx codes were phased
out, there were still probably many exchanges in Eire that dropped
into a N.I. trunk after dialing just 080, especially in small rural
SxS offices that survived until quite recently.

Unfortunately, the cellular companies don't always care where you WANT
your number to be "located." It is not at all unusual for the cellular
companies to issue a number in a rate center that is not local to the
user, unless the user is very careful. In some cases, the cellco issues
a number in the same area code, but in a completely different LATA.

A friend of mine who lives north of Berkeley, CA, got a cellphone, and
was issued a number in the Oakland/Trinidad rate center. The problem
is, that made it a long distance call from downtown San Francisco,
whereas a Berkeley or Oakland/Main number would be local. The customer
service droid took a while to grasp that my friend cared about more
than just the area code.

> The days of LD-rates that varied with area-code are also long gone.  

Except where you cross state lines. For instance, if you expect to get
any significant number of calls to the cellphone from upstate New York
or downstate New Jersey, you might want to consider getting a number in
the opposite state. (In-state rates are often much higher than
state-to-state rates.)

The champion for most time zones in an area code was, and still is,
867 in northern Canada, although it has dropped from 5 time zones to
only 3. When 867 was first created, it spanned Pacific, Mountain,
Central, Eastern, and Atlantic. However, Nunavut decided to move its
entire territory (originally spanning from Mountain to Atlantic) into
the Central time zone. Thus, it is now true (officially, at least)
that all of Yukon is Pacific, all of NWT is Mountain, and all of
Nunavut is Central. (Some years ago, some or all of Yukon was in the
Yukon time zone, an hour west of Pacific, but that ended long before
867 was created.)

There are also about 20 (from a quick scan of the map) area codes in
the US and Canada that are split between two time zones.

Last time I checked, a pretty hefty amount of that money went to the
ILEC in Puerto Rico. To quote from my post (which was from an AP
article):

So can anyone tell me where the current FCC breakdown is? And, BTW,
did any of us in the general public vote for such a massive transfer
payment to an ILEC? (And to follow up on my earlier comments: why is
the Federal Gov't picking up, via national taxes, what are
traditionally local responsibilities? Will they next tax us on our
fuel oil so as to supply school buses with discount diesel?)

Oh, and everyone realizes this is a tax which gets passed to us users,
right?

But they are. The same bottling companies typically turn out many
competing brands. They simply license the use of the name. Look at a
soda can sometime. "Under license from Coca Pepsi Corp (or whatever)..."

Oh, you have offices in your own region? PacBell, excuse me, SBC closed 
everything in California. I don't think it is possible to speak to 
anyone who isn't physically located in Texas.

Just about everything around here is carried on fiber -- it's hard not
to as there are also several hundreds of miles of dark fiber in the
roads.

Interoffice stuff is all fiber at this point but we won't see fiber to
the curb until the rules change again. Seems that the RBOC's don't
want to have to share that fiber with competitors and they're waiting
for the legislature and FCC to close that little loophole.

It's amusing watching the games that Verizon plays here in New
England.  For example, they want to hike the cutover charge for
unbundled loop elements from around $40 to over $150. That'll pretty
much cut the non- facilities based competitors out of the
ring. Theodore Vail would be proud.

LOL - that and deregulation. I've been of the opinion that the

A&P and Kroger are close enough. There are no Safeway stores in
Cleveland either (no Krogers either, amazingly enough, considering
that it's a Cincinnati company). But Safeway, A&P and Kroger are all
major chains, Kroger being the largest IIRC. There *is* no truly
nationwide grocery chain.

In fact, the AB breweries I've seen in Columbus, Ohio and St. Louis seem

 - Dec 15, 2002 12:48 PM (AP Online)

The Bush administration sped approval for moving one of the Internet's
13 traffic-management computers after a prominent technology company
urged the government to "declare some kind of national security threat
and blow past the process," according to federal officials' e-mails.

The correspondence provides a window into how U.S.  corporations
invoke national security to expedite business requests.

In this case, the Commerce Department approved in just two days
Verisign Inc.'s request at the end of October to move one of the 13
computer servers that manage global Internet traffic.  Verisign
operates two of the world's "root servers," which contain lists of
directories that control e-mail delivery and Web surfing.

Subject: Top Notch Advisers Fail to Pull Off Satellite Merger


By Arindam Nag

    NEW YORK, Dec 15 (Reuters) - A series of subtle miscalculations by
the top notch team of advisors hired by Hughes Electronics and
EchoStar Communications Corp. (NASDAQ:DISH) played a key role in the
failure of the satellite TV mega-merger this week, industry watchers
say.

    Hughes, owned by General Motors Corp. (NYSE:GM), and EchoStar
spent tens of millions of dollars in legal fees on hundreds of
anti-trust lawyers and staff to cajole authorities in Washington to
approve the $18 billion deal.

    The marriage would have combined Hughes' DirecTV with EchoStar's
DISH network, but 15 months of efforts finally came to nought this
week when both parties agreed to break it off in the face of stiff
opposition from authorities.

I once saw a comedian (I wish I could remember his name) say something like:

Once upon a time, if you called someone and they were on the phone,
you got a busy signal ... you'd say to yourself, "he's on the phone,
I'll call back later."

Now, thanks to call waiting, your call rings through; he interrupts
his current conversation to answer your call, tell you he was already
on the phone, and could you please call him back later.

Where would we be without this new technology?!?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I wonder if it occurs to some of these
'comedians' that occassionally two people are chatting about nothing
in particular and occassionally an important call may come in for one
or the other of them and they will wish to yeild their aimless conver-

Yes, but scaling in the other direction tips the advantage the other
way, in favor of signalized intersections.  You'll have to trust me on
this one, as I grew up in Massachusetts, probably the most
traffic-circle-intensive state in the country, although they are known
as "rotaries" (as in "rotary traffic") in the local vernacular.
(Ironic sidebar: I read somewhere that the term "roundabout" also
turns out to be an American coinage; the guy who apparently first
popularized the term was a Yank working for the BBC in Britain many
decades ago.)

Roundabouts work pretty well when the roads feeding into it all have
no more than one lane, but when one (or especially all) of the feeder
roads are major roads carrying two or more lanes in each direction,
the circle becomes a bottleneck.  If the circle itself has only one
lane of rotary traffic, then that obviously becomes the point of
single-threading.  But multi-lane circles aren't much better, because
any car that wishes to enter or exit one of the interior circular
lanes must obviously cut across the path of traffic on the circular
lanes outside it.  So the outermost circular lane once again becomes
the "hot spot" of traffic.  And of course, fun with fender benders
tends to ensue due to all the merging in and out of the inner lanes,
especially if a driver is deeply engrossed on the phone :-(.

Because Congress can get away with it, and can sway voters by doing so.

That's an interesting point -- during the Clinton Administration the
FCC discouraged carriers from itemizing the USF or e-rate charges on
bills, and IIRC threatened to cite carriers who did for misleading
their customers (since it is the carrier, not the customer, who is
liable for the fees).

I agree! It has been seriously discussed (and of course Sweden did). I
wouldn't describe either as an "international standard" though, since
there is a fairly even balance between left and right countries
worldwide. We're off topic though.

By "international standard" I mean one that is accepted by the great
majority of countries, not just more than one.

CRTC REINS IN TELCO AFFILIATES: In Telecom Decision 2002-76, the CRTC
says that telephone company affiliates are subject to the same rules
as the telco itself, when operating in the telco's territory. Decision
details include:

** In at least 111 cases, Bell Canada broke CRTC rules by not
    filing tariffs for bundled services offered through Bell
    Nexxia. Bell and other major telcos must file proposed
    tariffs and contract information for all current service
    bundles offered by themselves or their affiliates, by
    January 27.

** Bell and all the major ILECs must now include, in large
    bold print at the top of all contracts for bundled
    services, a clause notifying customers that rates and
    terms for the service are not final until approved by the
    Commission.

** For the time being, ILEC facilities-based affiliates must
    get Commission approval to resell ILEC tariffed services,
    other than high-speed Internet services sold to ISPs.

** A further proceeding will consider whether all services
    provided by ILEC affiliates should be tariffed, when those
    services would require a tariff if offered by the ILEC
    itself.

NORTEL NAMES ENTERPRISE PRESIDENT: Nortel Networks has named Malcolm
Collins, formerly the company's senior executive in western Europe, as
president of its enterprise division. He replaces CEO Frank Dunn, who
has been acting president of the enterprise division since it was
created three months ago.

MITEL GETS $60 MILLION FROM OTTAWA: Industry Canada says it will
provide up to $60 million for a broadband R&D project run by Mitel
Networks and March Networks.

COMPETITION COMMISSIONER OPPOSES OWNERSHIP CAPS: Konrad von
Finckenstein, head of the Competition Bureau, told a Commons committee
December 12 that restrictions on foreign ownership of telecom and
cable companies diminish competition and should be abolished. (See
Telecom Update #359)

MICROCELL LAYS OFF 6%: Microcell Telecommunications is laying off 149
employees across Canada, about 6% of its workforce.  The company also
reports that it has renegotiated the terms of a major contract with a
vendor to avoid being in default.

Yes, the interoffice plant in New England (and many other places) is
entirely glass, unless some remote islands are exceptions.  The local
loop plant is copper with glass to some outlying pedestals; how much
varies widely by place.  The drops to big business sites are glass;
small business and houses get copper.  The downside is that the
copper-behind-glass is very, very limited in capabilities, because
VeriZontal does not deploy DSLAMs outside of its big central offices.
So fiber-served neighborhoods have no real DSL options. (I don't count
IDSL, which CLECs can sometimes provision.)

VZ doesn't put DSL in the pedestals often (nor does SBC) because
there's an economy of scale involved, and central office deployments
are more profitable than pedestal deployments.  CLECs are
theoretically allowed to request access to the loops behind the
pedestals, and space in them, but the reality makes it extremely hard
if not impossible.

Well-positioned people at VZ told me that they don't think residential
subs don't really need DSL bandwidth, so fiber optics would be totally
wasted on them.  Let's hear it for marketing!  In public, they're
trying to get the rules changed to remove local competition.  They
traded it for access to LD, but now that they have the LD access,
they're trying to go back on the deal.

The most effective fix would be to separate the ILECs into two
unaffiliated entities, a sort of Divestiture II.  Just as 1984's
Divestiture I divided the old AT&T along regulated-monopoly /
unregulated-competitive lines.  In 1982, when the MFJ was being
written, all local (became "intra-LATA") was viewed as a "natural
monopoly".  Today, there's still a natural monopoly on the outside
plant portion of the business, such as local loops, pedestals, and
most interoffice fiber. And those are inextricably associated with
central office buildings (wire centers).  There's no real natural
monopoly on switching, or associated voice or data "services".  So I
suggest a split along those lines, with the service-ILECs becoming
sligtly-regulated collocators in "loopco"-owned central office
buildings.  The loop companies would then sell service to any comer
(at minimum, former-ILEC service/switchcos and CLECs) on equal terms.
And if any of them wanted to serve DSL behind fiber, or run fiber to
the home, then the more strictly-regulated loopco would do it on a
nondiscriminatory basis at a fair (regulated) price.

I've written a somewhat longer description of this proposal on the web
site for my consulting business, http://www.ionary.com/ , in the
'ions" section.  Digest readers might find it, and other things on the
site, interesting.

California is using ca.gov which, given that .gov is a TLD instead of
being under .us like it really ought to kind of makes a lot more sense

Universal service subsidies go back to the Communications Act of 1934.
Until the Bell breakup, the subsidies were done implicitly by
transfers within AT&T and, I suppose, payments to independents for
toll separations.  At the time of the Bell breakup, they made USF more
explicit, and starting in 1998 they started assessing it on monthly
bills as well as the surcharge on long distance they'd always used in
the past.

USF for phones was and is a good idea, since the more people you can
call, the more useful your phone is.  On the other hand, E-Rate,
funding school internet connections out of USF was an awful idea, both
because it's not the same issue, and because it forces schools to get
their internet from a provider that charges a money rate, rather than
buying their own wireless or other equipment that'd be cheaper in the
long run.

I'm not surprised that a lot of USF money goes to Puerto Rico.  USF
provides subsidies for high-cost rural service, as well as subsidies
for "lifeline" service to the poor.  Since most of P.R. is rural, and
all of P.R. is poor compared to the rest of the U.S., I'd expect them
to qualify for lots of USF money.

Besides, USF subsidies have been around since 1934.  They only became
explicit at the time of the Bell breakup because the old model of
doing them within AT&T wasn't possible any more.

Ignoring the E-rate botch, the point of USF subsidies is that your
phone is more valuable if you can call more people.  Subsidies for
high-cost and low-income phone areas have long been treated as part of
the normal costs of phone service.

Right.  The FAQ at universalservice.org, the company that administers
the USF fund, makes it clear that the USF line on your long distance
bill is unlikely to have much relationship to the actual USF fees that
your carrier pays.  But of course in the era of crony capitalism, how
could we take offense at a little profit stuffing at the public's
expense?

Coke and Pepsi bottlers have monopoly territorial contracts with the
Coke and Pepsi companies.  The main companies make the concentrated
syrup from the infamous secret formulae.  They sell the syrup to the
bottlers who dilute it with fizz water and put it in bottles and cans.
The license is a license to use the trademarks and to dilute the
syrup, not to make the product from scratch.  Coke bottlers rarely
carry competing brands unless they have a long-standing agreement with
another big brand like Dr. Pepper, and I've never known one to make
generic soda.  (Around here most of the generic soda comes from Cott
in Toronto, who are a big brand in Canada but nearly unkown here, so
they do generics instead.)

In the U.S., Anheuser-Busch makes all its own beer in 12 breweries
around the country.  (Outside the U.S., in some areas they make their
own, in others it's licensed, but who in their right mind is going to
drink Budweiser in Canada or Germany or Ireland?)  They also make some
more dubious stuff under names licensed from others, e.g., Bacardi and
Tequiza, but anything you buy in the US named Budweiser or Michelob or
Busch is made by A-B.

Coors makes their own beer in the original brewery in Colorado as well
as two new ones they run in Virginia and Tennessee.  Again, they make
some stuff with other names ("Killian's Red", a beer unknown in
Ireland) but anything in the U.S. called Coors, they made.

It's true, there are some beers brewed in a zillion different places,
such as Sam Adams, only a tiny fraction of which is made in their
brewery in Boston, but the brewers who know what they're doing have
little trouble spec'ing the product well enough that it's consistent
regardless of who's making it.

So as someone else said, it's not all like the telecom biz where you
can be practically certain that a phone with a famous brand on it is
made by anyone except the owner of the brand.

> Oh, you have offices in your own region?

I'm SO glad I don't have to deal directly with an RBOC.  Not only does
my telco have an office within walking distance, I know most of the
employees by name and could call them at home if something really
urgent came up.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Well, that's what we *used to have*
here in Independence years ago, when SWB Tel had the local business
office in the central office building at 6th and Maple. Mother said to
me the lady who worked over there took care of everything very nicely
and in a prompt, courteous fashion. There was a service rep and a
cashier in the local office. Then the service rep disappeared one day,
and in her place on her old desk was a speed dial telephone you would
use to call San Antonio or somewhere. There was still a couple of
cashiers there on duty, but you had to use those speed dial phones on
the desk to call service reps. Then one day the cashiers disappeared 
also and you were told (by a sign on the front door) to mail payments
to a PO Box in Texas and call on your own phone to talk to service
reps about any complaints. PAT]

You've all seen the "individual ink tanks" print ad for Canon printers
 -- a photo of four Christmas lights: magenta, cyan, black, and yellow.
The black one is allegedly burned out.

What I want to know is: if a black Christmas light is burned out, how
would you know it?

ObTelecom: Lights on manual PBXs are normally white, but colored
lenses are available for optional use; they can be used to indicate
special extensions, tie lines, etc.  A PBX operator I once knew told
me that she wished they made black lenses.  Apparently, she had a
certain obnoxious extension in mind.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Black lights are not as mysterious as
they may seem. They make a sort of ultra-violet lighting in a room. If
they are burned out, the ultra-violet light goes away. One of our
local bars here in Independence uses them in the dance floor
area. They flash at such a high speed it would appear the person in
the spotlight seems to come and go (in and out of sight) at a very
fast pace.  Regards your PBX operator friend, she seems to be
forgetting the common audible which sounds when *any* extension goes
off hook. That is, unless the common audible is wired in series
through the bulbs, in which case there would be dead silence as well
as a dead filament in the bulb, but usually the are not wired like
that. Also, in the case of switchboards its only the *globe* in front
of the plain bulb (underneath) which is of various colors. Typically
the globe will be a cream color, but the lights for police stations,
hospitals, etc will be a red color as advice to the operator regards
handling.  PAT]

Subject: AT&T '00' Menu Changed AGAIN


AT&T has changed the their 'OO' menu yet AGAIN!

It probably took effect on 1-December-2002...

Or MAYBE it is being "phased" in depending on which (WECO/Lucent-made)
AT&T 5E-OSPS you "home" on (US only). The New Orleans area (including
most of Louisiana and Mississippi, possibly western Tennessee, and
maybe parts of Alabama), all "home" on the AT&T 5E-OSPS in Jackson MS
(601-0T), JCSNMSPS06T. There are about 30+ AT&T 5E-OSPS switches in
the US, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. (and there is an AT&T 5E-OSPS in
Montreal PQ Canada for AT&T-Canada, but AT&T-Canada is almost 'no
more').

I didn't discover it until Sunday evening (15-Dec-2002), when I was at
a COCOT (private payphone) and thought I'd see what it did with
1-800-CALL-ATT. Even though I _DIALED_ (DTMF-keyed) 1-800-225-5288
into the private payphone's internal faux-dialtone/chips, I could then
faintly hear the DTMF touchtones as 101-0288-00 being sent to the
central office, rather than 1-800-225-5288 what I actually dialed.

And I discovered that the '00' (Double-Oh) AT&T "menu" has been changed
again. The sparkle-jingle and voice saying 'AT&T' is the same, but there
is yet a DIFFERENT voice than the previous ones used, giving the menu
options.

         ---

The previous menu quoted:

"AT&T:
To place a call, please dial the number you are calling;
For double-oh info, US Directory, press one;
For other requests, please say Information, Credit or Operator."

At this menu, you could touchtone:

ten-digits NANP, as either STRAIGHT ten-d, 1+ten-d, or 0+ten-d
(VERY flexible! all methods accepted for NANP destinations)

OR

01+intl+(#) or 011+intl+(#)
(AGAIN quite flexible! both methods accepted for non-NANP destinations)

(the next menu 'layer' was for billing collect or 3d party or card)

OR

'1' (followed by keying an optional '#' to cut-thru the delay to
timeout) for "Double-Oh Info US Directory"

OR

'2' (followed by keying an optional '#' to cut-thru the delay to
timeout) for a next menu 'layer' for additional options, such as
time-of-day, etc (You could speak the word 'INFORMATION' to get the
next menu 'layer' of additional options; 'information' does not
'necessarily' mean directory assistance here)

OR

'3' (followed by keying an optional '#' to cut-thru the delay to
timeout) for a next menu 'layer' of options to get credit for
misdials, bad transmission, cut-off, etc., the next menu-layer was
business-vs-residence accounts, NANP-vs-non-NANP destinations dialed
for credit, etc (You could speak the word 'CREDIT' to get this next
menu layer)

OR

'0' (followed by keying an optional '#' to cut-thru the delay to
timeout) to get a REAL LIVE Operator. Speaking the word 'OPERATOR'
also cut-you-thru to a live operator. Of course, when she/he comes on
the line you FIRST hear a generic digitally recorded female (or male)
voice saying "AT&T, how may I help you", even though the live human is
already there on the line.

Some other things to touchtone-key or speak, not mentioned in the
previous menu include:

'*' + 7 + the speed-dial-code of variable digits + optional '#'
if your destination number is also stored as a speed-dial code for your
calling card to subsequently be keyed/entered.

'*' + 1XX + option '#' to switch-over to a live operator (or menu for
operator/card services) in ALTERNATE LANGUAGES, the '1XX' code
identifying the specific language desired. Spanish is '111', which was
the only one which had an AUTOMATED menu (at Dallas OSPS, 214-0T),
live Spanish operator also available to cut-thru-to. All other
languages are live-operator-only based in either Sherman Oaks CA OSPS
(818-0T) or New York City NY Broadway-26T OSPS (212-0T). If you wanted
to switch-over to the Spanish language card/opr menu, you alternately
could speak the word 'e-span-(Y)OL' with the proper accent/inflection.

     ---

The new menu quotes (and I am doing this from memory and notes I
scribbled down; I have not yet tape-recorded this for a complete full
exact transcription though):

"AT&T:
To place a call, please enter the area code and telephone number that you
are calling;
For double-oh info, US Directory, press one;
For international directory, or other 'information, press two;
For AT&T Customer Sales and Service, press three;
For Credit, press five;
For rates, terms and conditions, press nine."

SOME OSPS-es might still allow you to "do nothing" and "time-out" to a
live human operator; some might disconnect you if you have done
"nothing".

Destination numbers are still keyed as: (1+/0+/nothing) ten-digits,
NANP 01(1)+intl+(#), non-NANP

Double-Oh Info US Directory is reached as '1(#)'

"Information" (international Directory and other 'information) is
reached as '2(#)' or speaking the word 'INFORMATION'

Customer Sales and Service (I guess the AT&T Business Office and AT&T
Repair) is reached as '3(#)', but I don't know if there is a WORD to
speak as well...

The 'credit' options sub-menu is now reached as '5(#)' but you can
still speak the word 'CREDIT'

But keying '0(#)' is treated as not-valid!!!

Rates/Terms/Conditions as '9(#)' _IS_ the Operator, and you can still
reach her (him) by speaking the word 'OPERATOR' as well.

the *7+speed-code+(#) still seems to work at the new '00' menu

the *1XX(#) codes for alternate languages still seems to work as well,
but I was UNABLE to get it to switch-over-to-Spanish if I spoke the word
"Espanol" on the new '00' menu.

On the new menu, keying '4(#)' goes to Double-Oh-Info-US-Directory,
just like '1(#)' does; The following at the '00' menu are all treated
as NOT valid: '6(#)', '7(#)', '8(#)', and as mentioned '0(#)';

I don't know how the OLDER menu treated things outside of what were
known-to-be-valid, i.e. what happened with '4(#)', '5(#)', ... ,'9(#)'?

  ---

BTW, the 1-800-CALL-ATT Menu (dialed from within the US; there is an
abbreviated AT&T-USA-Direct when 1-800-CALL-ATT is dialed from Canada
or other NANP or NANP-like countries that one can dial 1-800-CALL-ATT
 from):

(it is the 'traditional' AT&T voice, though)

"AT&T
To place a calling card or credit card call, press one;
To place a collect call, press two;
For AT&T Customer Service, press three;
For Double-Oh-Info-US-Directory, press four;
For Rates, Terms and Conditions, OR to place an operator assisted call,
press zero, now."

There are NO voice/vocabulary/speak options on the 1-800-CALL-ATT
menu.  ONLY DTMF-Touchtone-keying is allowed...  OR you can "do
nothing" if you simply want to time-out-to-a-live-operator.

Destination numbers for both card or collect calls do NOT have to be
started off with the '1(#)' or '2(#)' menu levels. You can start off
by simply keying the destination numbers as is, straight-ten-d OR 1+
OR 0+ ten-d for NANP locations, or simply start off keying
01(1)+intl+(#) for non-NANP locations.

(AT&T's card/operator platform is VERY flexible/robust as to how you
want to key/enter destination numbers when compared with OTHER
LD-carriers' card/opr menu platforms! However, 010+ or 00+ for
non-NANP is *NOT* allowed).

The Customer Service press-three is really '3' followed by a delay OR
you could have keyed '3(#)'. Similarly, the Double-Oh-US-Directory
press-four is really '4' followed by a delay OR you could have keyed
'4(#)'. The Operator quoted as press-zero is really '0' followed by a
delay OR you could have keyed '0(#)'.

The menu quoted does NOT mention anything for other digits.

Lead off digits of '6(#)', '7(#)', '8(#)', or '9(#)' give an invalid
message, but if you key two invalids in a row, the second one cuts you
thru to a live opearator.

A lead off of '5(#)', goes to a second layer: "Press-one for English;
Para Espanol marque-dos" I think this is for adding units to a prepaid
AT&T Calling Card.

The *1XX(#) alternate language options are _ONLY_ available on the
'00' access menu, and _NOT_ available on any 800- dialup access
methods to AT&T OSPS Opr/Card services.

The *7+ for speed dial codes associated with a calling card are
available on the 1-800-CALL-ATT menu, and on ALL methods of access to
AT&T OSPS card/operator service. Also, the '*' (star) button can be
used when entering a digit-string, if you think you have made a
mistake -- keyed the wrong digit in a destination number or
card-entry, you can "clear" what you have already keyed and
"start-over" by using the '*' (star) button.

  ---

The new menu on '00' seems to DISCORAGE use of live operators. Rates,
of course, ARE QUITE HIGH when you use an operator to place your call
for you. Even if you were having difficulty in placing your call, and
you use and AT&T Operator to attempt the call, or maybe even reach
distant local telco "inward" (NPA+0XX+121) for her to try to reach the
number, you are still charged AT&T Operator _HANDLED_ rates. Of
course, when the bill eventually comes, if you check your bill and
remember such operator calls, you can always call the AT&T Business
Office/Customer (dis)Service, and get the charge adjusted down in such
cases, but after you have waited on hold 'forever'.

I don't know how many actual "operator centers" AT&T still has ... it
might be anywhere between six and ten these days. They were trying to
reduce them down a few years back, and have mostly reduced them. When
you actually get a live AT&T Operator, she/he could be located
virtually anywhere in the (continental) US, regardless of where in the
(continental) US you are calling from or whatever OSPS _switch_ you
"home" on. This situation of routing to to WHATEVER AT&T Operator is
avaiable wherever she/he happens to be, regardless of whatever OSPS
switch you "home" on is now called "INTER-flow"... not even 'overflow'
anymore, but INTER-flow!


AT&T Operators _ARE_ Unionized, and I know that the CWA
(Communications Workers of America) are _NOT_ really "happy" with all
of the consolidation, reductions, and other changes that AT&T has
embarked on over the past 10+ years regarding Operator services.

Subject: Mac Fraud Bust: the Inside Story


By Andrew Orlowski in San Francisco
Posted: 12/12/2002 at 22:45 GMT

Police in Markham, Illinois charged a 38-year old man this afternoon 
on two counts of forgery.

The arrest is the result of extraordinary perseverance and pluck from
a 21 year old New Orleans student, aided by the online Mac community.

Melvin Christmas obtained a G4 PowerBook from a student Jason Eric 
Smith, and paid for it using a counterfeit check from LaSalle bank.


http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/39/28548.html


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  I am certainly glad Jason got his
money and did not get cheated out of his computer. For those folks
who do not know the Chicago, Illinois area all that well, Markham
is a mostly black, rather poor suburb on the far south side of the
city. There is a lot of crime there. I am sure Jason and his computer
were not the biggest items on the police agenda for the day. The
story is a good one to read.   PAT]

Here in Illinois SBC is holding off on installing remote DSLAMS
because they want to only install their own ADSL equipment, and not
allow foreign equipment.

Last I heard, which was a while ago, the issue had stalemated in the

The whole concept of the Universal Service Fund need to be rethought.
People think I'm constantly harping on this subject, but it's a
symptom of other problems with government today. If universal service
is an important societal goal (which I disagree with) then the costs
should be borne by taxpayers, not ratepayers. My electric and gas
utilities effectively do the same thing, but they don't break it out
as a line item on the bill so we don't see it. They can not disconnect
deadbeats from early winter through late winter. Never the less, guess
who eats the costs of those unpaid utility bills? The ratepayer.

When you choose to live 40 miles away from state-of-the-art
infrastructure you may encounter a down side. Deal with it.

 From a traffic engineering standpoint, I understand that the main
benefit of a traffic circle over an intersection is the reduced number
of potential collision points and the lower energy vectors of those
collisions. That is to say that a circle pretty much does away with
head-on and T-bone collisions (except in the case of a completely
disoriented driver).

I still hate the damn things and find them counter-intuitive,
though ...

In that case, driving on the right side of the road is an
international standard, whether measured by number of countries,
population, land area or size of road networks.  The balance is far
from "fairly even"; right wins by a landslide.  See

It's a mess that hasn't really been sorted out since the latest
changes.  More than half the population of London still seems to think
they have two area codes (0207 and 0208, replacing the old 0171 and
0181, replacing the even older 071 and 081) followed by seven-digit
local numbers, rather than a London-wide code, 020, followed by
eight-digit local numbers. The publicity never really got across that
the old area code split was being abolished. So they still dial the
area code when they dial across the old code boundary: in fact, they
are so confused they play safe and dial the area code in front of
everything -- presumably having not got through after dialing just
seven digits. I'd be interested to know if a similar situation applies
in Northern Ireland and in Portsmouth/Southampton.

Considering that everyone has to dial the area code from mobile phones
(and we now have a mobile phone penetration of 70-80% in the UK) I
don't know why we don't just follow the Belgians and (almost) Italians
and move to full code+number dialing.

Long time ago, though, Paul -- back in the late 1960s, and dropped
when all-figure numbering was introduced. So just as Leeds was 0LE2
and Leicester was 0LE3, Oxford was 0OX2. The "O" in the old UK dial
went with the "0", so the Oxford code as equivalent to 0092; but in
around 1968-69 the UK dropped letters in codes. While Leeds and
Leicester changed to 0532 and 0533, Oxford was given a new code, 0865,
which -- with the extra 1 after the zero -- still exists as 01865.

At the same time named exchanges in London, Manchester etc were
replaced. So (01) FLEet Street 6170 (Ye Old Cheshire Cheese pub, at 15
Fleet Street) became 01-353 6170 and is today 020 7353 6170.

Dave Farber was Jon Postel's thesis advisor. Dave Farber was also part
of ITAG, which designed ICANN.  UltraDNS is of course Rodney Joffe's
company. Rodney Joffe placed Jon Postel on the Board of Genuity prior
to selling that company. Dave Manning is of course part of ARIN and
also USC/ISI IANA and was named in the .WEB lawsuit following the
events where Chris Ambler gave Jon Postel a $1,000 check via Bill
Manning, who claimed he did not know there was a check, despite
supplying Chris Ambler (.WEB) with the envelope to put the check
in. UltraDNS and New.Net are also partners. Dave Farber was employed
by the FCC during the Clinton administration, during the time when
William Daley was running the U.S.  Department of Commerce creating
ICANN, prior to Daley leaving to run the Al Gore campaign which
resulted in Daley attempting to get the votes counted in Florida in
Gore's favor. Dave Farber of course was one of the people, along with
Vinton Cerf who helped claim that Al Gore invented the
Internet. Vinton Cerf was a DARPA funding manager and went to the same
high-school as Jon Postel. Vinton Cerf has most recently been an
executive at Worldcom (MCI) and also runs ICANN and founded the ISOC.

David J. Farber, a professor of computer science at the University of
Pennsylvania and one of the early players in the Internet, said that
along with the importance of his legislative initiatives, Gore
popularized the emerging medium worldwide. Gore aligned himself with
high tech long before every lawmaker boasted of his or her personal
Web site. He helped popularize the term "information superhighway,"
drawing on the symbolism of his father's hand in creating the
interstate highway system.

Vinton G. Cerf, a senior vice president at MCI Worldcom and the person
most often called "the father of the Internet" for his part in
designing the network's common computer language, said in an e-mail

Subject: Keeping Track of John Poindexter


By Paul Boutin
02:00 AM Dec. 14, 2002 PT

The head of the government's Total Information Awareness project,
which aims to root out potential terrorists by aggregating
credit-card, travel, medical, school and other records of everyone in
the United States, has himself become a target of personal data
profiling.

Online pranksters, taking their lead from a San Francisco journalist, 
are publishing John Poindexter's home phone number, photos of his 
house and other personal information to protest the TIA program.

Matt Smith, a columnist for SF Weekly, printed the material -- which 
he says is all publicly available -- in a recent column: 
"Optimistically, I dialed John and Linda Poindexter's number -- (301) 
424-6613 -- at their home at 10 Barrington Fare in Rockville, Md., 
hoping the good admiral and excused criminal might be able to offer 
some insight," Smith wrote.

Subject: As Internet Use Rises, Families Without Access Lag Behind


THE CHALKBOARD
By Laura Pappano, 12/15/2002

Parent Deborah Burnett is forever checking Marblehead Middle School's 
Web site or e-mailing daughter Jessica's seventh-grade teachers.

"I have one teacher I'm going to e-mail tonight because we are missing
each other; she has been calling me at work and I call her and she is
in the classroom," said Burnett of Hyde Park, whose daughter
participates in the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity,
or Metco, the 36-year-old program sending urban children to suburban
schools.

At many schools today, directories list parents' e-mail addresses,
used for activities as varied as sounding an alarm about a local
education issue, checking in with teachers, or getting out birthday or
social invitations. Schools also are putting more information on Web
sites, guarding against papers lost between school and home or left in
the backpack. Some teachers have their own Web site on which parents
can view homework assignments.

Internet use is coming of age - not just in schools, but around school
communities. But what if you're not hooked up?

    Keith McCaw, a billionaire whose family helped create a

    Reached in Auckland, New Zealand, family spokesman Bob

    died early that morning.

    Police and firefighters received a 911 call of a possible
    drowning in the block where McCaw's mansion sits near Lake

    pronounced dead at the scene.

    The cause of death was not immediately known.

    LONDON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - BT Group (ISEL:BT), Britain's
dominant fixed line telecoms firm, is aiming to cash in on the
music download craze, launching on Monday a subscription-based
Internet service called "dotmusic on demand."

   The venture, a partnership between BT and OD2, the British
technology firm co-founded by musician Peter Gabriel, will
enable BT to sell music downloads and audio streams of up to
120,000 songs on BT's new music site www.dotmusic.com.

Subject: Australian Ruling is Raising Worries


By Mark Jurkowitz, Globe Staff, 12/16/2002

A number of concerned First Amendment advocates say a landmark libel
decision by the Australian High Court may have the effect of erecting
a fence on the borderless information frontier opened up by Internet
technology.

The Dec. 10 ruling concluded that an Australian businessman, Joseph 
Gutnick, could sue Dow Jones for defamation in Australia based on a 
Barron's magazine story that emanated from the company's computer 
servers in New Jersey. Although, as attorney Harvey Silverglate 
explains, defamation cases have traditionally been brought 'in the 
jurisdiction where the speech is uttered or published or where you 
targeted it,' the ruling effectively expanded that jurisdiction in 
the online world to where a story can be downloaded.

The case involves a 'United States media publication which is really 
focused on United States markets and United States investors' and 
'a journalist who operated completely out of the United States,' 
says Stuart Karle, a Dow Jones associate general counsel. ''This 
dramatically changes how you can communicate within this country.'

Several observers expressed the fear that the ruling would subject 
American journalism to legal challenges in countries with a far more 
restrictive view of the First Amendment - or else simply act as a 
deterrent to publication for that very reason.

FREE EXPRESSION THINK TANK RELEASES GUIDE TO COPYRIGHT BATTLES 

Should teenagers be allowed to swap music over the Internet? Should
computer hackers be permitted to decrypt the entertainment industry's
electronic locks on e-books, songs, or movies? Where should we draw
the line between rewarding creativity through the copyright system and
society's competing interest in the free flow of ideas?

In light of these and other concerns which have become the subject of
heated debate in Congress, academia, and the arts and entertainment
industries, the Free Expression Policy Project announces its release
of "The Progress of Science and Useful Arts": Why Copyright Today
Threatens Intellectual Freedom. This 71-page policy report --
available now online at
www.fepproject.org/policyreports/copyright.html demystifies such
complex laws as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act and
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, and deconstructs the underlying
conflicts over "fair use," parody, copying, and the public domain.

The report contains eight recommendations for a better-balanced public
policy on copyright and free expression. What with the U.S. government
prosecuting a Russian company for creating a device to decrypt
electronic books, and entertainment companies trying to shut down
file-sharing programs like Grokster and KaZaA, this timely report will
be an invaluable guide to the copyright battles that lie ahead.

Founded in 2000, the Free Expression Policy Project is a think tank on
artistic and intellectual freedom that seeks free-speech friendly
solutions to the concerns that drive censorship campaigns. For more

Frequently my Panasonic answer machine (model KX-TG2583W) will answer
with what sounds like a fax or data tone.  I've experimented and
determined that it appears to happen when a message is recorded and
the phone rings immediately afterward.  Customer support gave me some

Has anybody encountered this type of thing before?

However, have you noticed that Coke and Pepsi taste differently in
various regions? It takes no special talent to recognize the
difference between a Bay Area canned Coke and one canned in Atlanta.

Why would that be?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Because some of the bottlers are using
less or more syrup than the 'secret formula' calls for. At the DeFever
Rexall Drug Store downtown here, they mix drinks manually at the
fountain. That is, they put in the ice for the glass, push a pump
to add the syrup, then hold the glass under the fizz water faucet
to finish filling the glass. Some of them do it correctly; others
either add too much syrup or not enough before adding the fizz
water. Its all acceptable, but some taste better than others. If
you complain, they will dilute the mixture a little better, either
adding a bit more syrup or a bit more water or ice or whatever.
With the bottling plants, I suspect they are trying to be cheap and
get by with less syrup.    PAT]

And let the champaign corks fly. At least now we can still have some
competition somewhere in the communications business. In all the
verbiage put forth from the merger propaganda department, I had never
heard one word about how I, an existing customer, would benefit from
Echostar buying out Hughes. Not one. I had to assume that there would
be no benefit.

But that is normal in mergers: customers seldom benefit and frequently

     Nextel Confirms 2002 Guidance Demonstration of Nextel's
     Nationwide Direct Connect and 6:1 Vocoder
     - Dec 17, 2002 07:03 AM (BusinessWire)

RESTON, Va. and PLANTATION, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 17, 2002--In a
live Web cast, Nextel Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:NXTL) and Motorola
Inc. (NYSE:MOT), will announce today updates regarding the companies'
plans to extend the efficiency, differentiation and longevity of the
iDEN(R)digital wireless network.

    Nextel Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Paul
Saleh will kick off the technology update. According to Saleh, "By
strategically investing in the iDEN platform, we're able to provide an
excellent wireless experience for our customers while generating a
better return on our investment. This is a win for our customers, our
employees, and our stockholders."

    Nextel is working with Motorola on two significant technical
projects- nearly doubling the voice capacity of Nextel's interconnect
network, and expanding the Direct Connect(TM) digital walkie-talkie
feature to make it possible to conduct two-way radio calls nationwide.
"We're progressing on schedule, while exceeding our expectations for
quality," said Barry West, senior vice president and chief technical
officer of Nextel.  West states that Nextel has tested the next phase
of Motorola's voice coder software which will nearly double the
capacity of the company's wireless interconnect network, and the calls
on the new software sound superb. Also referred to as a "6:1 voice
coder" since it allows six cellular calls to be conducted concurrently
over a single radio channel, the companies affirmed the new technology
will be delivered on time in the first quarter of 2003, with third
quarter commercial roll-out.

Well, with CW at the least you know someone is trying to reach you.
If you answer it, then you also know who.  That's what the new
technology gets you.

/JBL

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Yeah, really it is ideal for folks
where one line is not enough, yet two lines is too many. This idea
of one and a half lines works out fine. But one caveat:  If there are
two or three guys living together in one house, but only one phone
line with 'call waiting' (which would seem okay), then invariably,
when the call waiting arrives, the call is going to be for one of the 
other people there, so someone has to yield the line or be imposed upon
as a result. Call waiting only really works when you have a single 
person in a house who can realistically only talk on one call at a 
time. When you get a second or third person there in residence, or
have heavy use on the phone (for example a modem or fax) then you
really need to have two or three actual phone lines. Ideally they
would be in a hunt group, so that any resident there could have the
flexibility of overflow in calls at any time.   PAT]

It has to do with the water used to make the carbonated water in the 
first place. 

I can recall that when Coca Cola moved their bottling plant from 
Providence, RI to Needham, MA you could literally taste the difference.

*I* have never noticed that, and *I* am a Coca Cola fanatic.  I love the
stuff.  I knew back in 1979 when they were making the switch from cane
sugar to corn syrup; I didn't know that's what they were doing, but I knew
damn well there was A level Coke and there was B level Coke.  In fact, I
now order the real stuff from the net.  Expensive, but worth it.

Trust me, I'd notice such differences if they existed.  You may perceive
such differences, but that doesn't mean such differences exist.

By the way, have you noticed that fountain Coke tastes different, by
and large, than canned Coke?  Have you noticed that one restaurant's
fountain Coke tastes different than another restaurant's fountain
Coke?  It comes down to (a) the choice of the restaurant for how much
syrup to dispense, and/or (b) the hand of the service guy who
maintains the fountain.  Just like everyone's hand is slightly
different when pounding out Morse code, every fountain service guy is
slightly different.

I expect similar things are happening from one bottling plant to another.

But if you control the mixing process, it is not true that there are
differences due strictly to region.  It's all the same syrup.  You know
that, you just refuse to admit it.

John, you're now rolling into the realm of the ridiculous in order to
try to keep your "national branding is a farce" assertion alive at any
cost.  Face it: what you assert isn't the case.  It is in your world,
but your world is a tiny, tiny place relative to the whole world at
large.  You can't take what's happened in the telecom world over the
past several years and apply it to the rest of the world.  The telecom
world is weirder than most can imagine, and stranger than anyone could
sit down and invent.

I understand that Coke bottled in Hawaii tastes different too, because
it's sweetened with sugar instead of corn syrup.

(or is that a myth?  I don't think the seekrit syrup comes sweetened -- I
seem to recall seeing rail tank cars of corn syrup parked next to the
bottling plant I used to drive by  - /J)

Another reason is the "raw material" used with the postmix and drink
manufacturing, the water.

In Australia, the quality and taste of city water can vary
considerably, and sometimes this is reflected in the products
manufactured or mixed in those particular places.

In one example I remember clearly, a few years ago Brisbane was in the
middle of a significant drought which resulted in a lot of chlorine
being added to the water supply to keep it potable, and you could
certainly taste it in postmix Coke and other drinks.

The various chemicals and minerals in different water supplies can have
all sorts of reactions with various beverages, some more noticable than
others.

This has been put to the Regulator (OFTEL) on a number of occasions
but the regime currently there refuses to do anything to help put this
right.  Perhaps the new UK regulator, (OFCOM), may feel the need to be
more customer-friendly once they have "come into being".

This to a large extent down to how the Telcos - mainly BT - are seen
to be using the codes themselves!  But let me be very clear that the
"mess" you refer to is solely a result of bad publicity-handling ...
and not indicative of anything wrong with the actual numbering scheme.
This new scheme will settle down - these are perhaps only early days!

> I'd be interested to know if a similar situation applies in
> Northern Ireland and in Portsmouth/Southampton.

Northern Ireland: NO -- because most of the numbers were not straight
transpositions.  There were a LOT of 5-digit local numbers there that
had to have variations on the standard change algorithm.  Portsmouth
etc: YES, because they behave largely like London/Cardiff etc.

It was shown that, since over 50% of all calls made are local, and
since also the proportion of calls that are misdialled is far lower
when dial-strings are kept to eight digits or less, retaining 8-digit
(or less) dialling for local/regional calls would be beneficial to
everyone.  Mobile phones are different because quite a percentage of
calls from mobiles are made to numbers stored in the phones' memories.

The change to (provincial) codes beginning "00" did not take place
until a year or two AFTER the general "conversion" to all-figure
format.  Most places were straight conversions - Oxford from 0OX2
to 0092, etc -- the exceptions being those major cities which had
what were called "Director" systems, identifiable by area codes in
the form 01 or 0X1 (where 1<X<7).  In those cities there was a need
for additional internal renumberings for some COs to achieve the
"sectorisation" of their codes, so that remote tandems and trunk
switches could route directly to a sector switching tandem, rather
than having to route all calls to the central tandem for that city:
this helped relieve great congestion at those central tandems!

Although some UK equipment could store the whole (six-digit) prefix
and use that to route calls (and the UK number plan specification
was written to allow that) the extra equipment needed to do that was
significantly more expensive: and so the technique was rarely used.
Instead, almost all routings were done on the first three digits
dialled after the initial "0", which would in some cases also include
part of the local number.  So while Oxford would be routed as (0)OX2,
Manchester would be routed as (0)612, (0)613, (0)614, etc: the last
digit in each case being repeated forward to the destination city's
"inward" tandem.

Sectorisation involved re-prefixing exchanges so that all the central
zone numbers now had prefixes beginning 2 or 8, and each outer sector
had its single identifying first digit.  So RINgway exchange changed
from "746" to "980" as South West Manchester was allocated sector "9".

In London it wasn't possible to do things that way because there were
too many COs in the central zone to fit behind a single initial digit;
also there were many numbers there which were too-well-known to risk
being changed.  So London allocated batches of digit pairs to each
sector, to minimise the number of changes needed.  ABBey (as the main
Westminster exchange was called) could remain "222", since 01-22 was
"Central" sector: but WHItehall (which served Buckingham Palace) had
to change from "944" to "930" because although 01-92 and 01-93 were
Central, 01-94 had been designated as South West sector to avoid
changing the numbers in world-famous WIMbledon.

With the substantial upheaval in London, there were many misdialled
calls and the (then) GPO needed a lot of announcement machines to
tell callers what they should have dialed.  Only when the volume
of misdials had gone down were they able to release some machines
to be ready to handle the misdials that were expected to result from
changing all the codes that began "00" - involving Oxford and several
dozen other major towns - such as Orpington, Oban, Oakham, etc

That's why those towns and cities did not change until about 1969!

My experience when visiting London this past spring was that calls
from BT payphones, like cellphones, require full national dialing; at
least, my attempts to dial eight digits didn't go through, but dialing
"020" first did.

This brings to mind my frustration with the New York Times Sunday
travel section, which has the bad habit of making NO distinction
whatsoever between NANP numbers and everything else. It's not uncommon
to see articles giving phone numbers for Australian hotels,
restaurants, etc.  as "(61 2) xxxx-xxxx", in the same week's section
that might be listing Minneapolis hotels as "(612) xxx-xxxx", and I
suspect that at least a few unwitting readers end up reaching
Minneapolis when they mean to be calling Sydney. The Times also seems
to have missed the news that London went to eight digits; an article
on London a week or two ago was full of (44 207)xxx-xxxx style
numbers. Somebody buy those people a "+" symbol and a clue (or even an
"011," considering that nearly all their distribution is within the
NANP)!

> and move to full code+number dialing.

France seems to now require full national dialing; even from a
residential.

All of which is VERY recent history in the grand scheme of things; the
pub in question boasts a sign outside noting it was *re*built after
the Great Fire in 1666! So even if it's had a phone of any number
since, say, 1890, that's still barely a third of its history :-)

Subject: Coin Collect and Return


Somebody in another forum mentioned that a Verizon tech told him of
payphones which used a third wire from the CO with +/- 70V DC for coin
collect and return.

I've never heard of such a system, and it seems odd to me that a TelCo
would go to the trouble of using a third wire to each coin phone.  I
was always under the impression that the most common U.S. method (at
least in the old Bell System) was +/-120V DC applied across one side
of the line and ground.

Has anyone heard of this 3rd-wire 70V arrangement, either in the old
Bell System or in any independents?  What other systems have been used
for coin collect/return?


Paul Coxwell,
Norfolk, U.K.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Long time ago, when telco used three
wires on all phones, the third wire was a connection to ground, when
it was thought necessary to have it that way. In particular, pay
phones all required three wires (one to earth ground) to 'start' the
phone. You can still get a 'ground start' type line if you need it.

Far too many years ago, as a twelve year old brat child, a relative
had a payphone in his Walgreen's Drug Store in Whiting, Indiana. The
drug store had a phone by the cashier which was for the store use, but
my relative, the pharmacist had a private line at the pharmacy counter
to call the doctors, etc. Phone number was Whiting 89. He also had a
payphone at the front of the store, an old, ground start payphone in
a phone booth, a light in it and a seat, with a door that would close
to allow privacy in your conversations. Remember those? It was across 
 from the fountain area. Occassionally the payphone would ring with an
incoming call, for various people who were never there. I 'fixed' that
phone so that there was an extension on it, by using a two-line turn
button style phone which I mounted on the wall in place of the wall
telephone in the pharmacy area in the back of the store. In addition
to the usual read/green wires to the new extension which I put on one
side of the turn button, I put my uncle's private phone on the other
side of the turn button. If the payphone in the front of the store
rang, he could answer it back there on the extension at the pharmacy
counter by just turning the button and lifting the receiver. 

I tapped into the phone box on the wall in a back area; I thought I
did a pretty good job on it. So my uncle could also make outgoing
calls on the payphone from his phone at the pharmacy counter, I also
ran the black wire from the payphone ground back there, and used the
push ability on the turn button (normally open, push to close) to
bring up the ground from the payphone. On payphones in those days,
dropping the nickle in the slot on the top of the phone caused a
mechanical finger in the phone to fall down and trip the ground wire
when someone wanted to use the phone. Tripping the ground for a half
second or so brought battery on the line, completed the loop, and
allowed for the operator to come on and ask what you wanted. The way I
fixed the extension, by pressing the turn button for a half second or
so, then releasing it (when on that side of the phone line) you got
the operator without having to put a nickle in to get her attention.

It worked fine for a week or two, then one day the telephone inspector
came around and I saw him talking to my uncle in the rear off the
store. I made a sort of hasty exit, and stood on the sidewalk out in 
front of the store. Presently the inspector came out and gave me a
sort of dirty look. He said 'something was wrong on the pay station,
and he had to repair it.' He wondered if 'someone had tampered with
it.' I told him I saw a 'bunch of kids' in there one day, maybe they
had fooled around with it. The inspector looked at me and said 'well
if I find the little bastards who cheated the phone company out of
its money, there will be hell to pay. If you know who they were, you
better warn them not to do it any more.' I assured him I would 'warn
the guys I knew' not to mess around with the phone again and he said
please be sure you do. I still remember that man; he had a big, red
nose, no doubt from drinking too much ice tea. He said, 'I think you
know too much for your own good. I hope I don't have to come here and
visit with you again.' I know at the time it did scare me a little, 
but I was only 12-13 years old. 
    
Anyway, prior to 'dialtone first' payphones, you had to apply ground
with that third wire (hopefully with a coin deposit in the slot on
top) to get battery and/or operator and/or dialtone to make a call.)
Where I went to high school we just used a safety-pin stabbed in the
curly-cord to the handset to accomplish the job, and when that failed
and a nickle or later a dime or two nickles was required, we had to
use a bent coat hanger shoved up the return slot to retrieve the coins
 from the escrow table inside the phone. Now receiver cords are
'armored' and coin returns have trap doors on them to prevent that
sort of tomfoolery.  PAT]

Folks,

Are there any legitimate 900 number providers?

Who are they? 

A google search turned up droves of outfits with hucksteresque
pitches.

Everyone in the legitimate telecommunication industry seems to claim
no knowledge of 900 numbers, as if it was an irreparably tainted
topic.

Where do software companies go, for example, when they are setting up
900 tech support lines, etc?

Subject: AOL Wins Legal Round Against Spammers


By Erin Joyce

America Online has won a legal victory against a long time nemesis, 
CN Productions, which AOL has repeatedly accused of spamming its 
members with a daily barrage of pornographic e-mails.

The ISP said a U.S. District Court in Virginia has awarded it close to
$7 million in statutory damages in connection with its ongoing
complaint against CN Productions, formerly of Rockford, Illinois. The
company has been fighting for at least four years to get CN
Productions to stop spamming its members.

In ruling for AOL, a federal court also broadened the scope of a prior
injunction AOL had won, helping AOL's quest to break the back of an
international spam ring. The group has repeatedly sent porn-related
spam to AOL members, the company charged, even after a federal judge
slapped one of the alleged spam participants with an injunction
barring the activity.

Go-Video D2730 Wins Innovation Award From CEA

SONICblue introduced its first networked DVD player, the Go-Video
D2730, which helps to bring all the pictures, music and video clips
stored on a computer onto a TV. The product also received some pre-CES
attention with Consumer Electronic Association (CEA) selecting it as a
2003 Innovation Award winner.

The Go-Video D2730 is the first player of its kind to have the
capability to stream MPEG2 video files through a wireless network from
a computer to consumer electronics component. The D2730 works with
either a PCMCIA Ethernet Adapter (included) or an optional PCMCIA
802.11b Wireless Network Card and can stream MPEG1 and MPEG2 video
files that are compressed at bitrates up to 3 Mbps. The networked DVD
Player can also stream audio files in both WMA and MP3 format and JPEG
image files.

Subject: Satellite Phones Get Another Chance


As summarized in NewsScan Daily for December 17. 2002:

    SATELLITE PHONES GET ANOTHER CHANCE

Satellite phone companies Iridium and Globalstar foundered in
the 1990s mainly because everything about them was pricey: the
phones themselves cost as much as $3,000, customers had to pay
as much as $7 a minute to use make calls, and they required
expensive cell towers.

But now the Federal Communications Commission is getting ready
to approve a plan that will allow companies such as New ICO
(backed by wireless pioneer and billionaire Craig McCaw),
Globalstar, and Mobile Satellite Ventures (MSV) to offer
systems that are much less costly (only about 30% more than
ordinary cell phone prices) yet able to work virtually anywhere
in the world.

It's even worse than that.  As of 2002, there were 191 countries in
the UN as per http://www.un.org/Overview/growth.htm (some of them

I can virtually guarantee that *ANY* website in world is breaking a
law *SOMEWHERE* on this planet.

   Full-frontal nude pictures are considered obscene in some
jurisdictions.

   OK, how about women dressed in street clothes ?  Sorry, but in
Islamic Republics, *ANY* "graven images" are illegal.  And
Full-facial-female-nudity is obscene.

   OK, how about a text-only website in plain English?  Sorry, even
*THAT* is illegal in France.  Remember the kerfuffle about the
American University in Paris, target audience Americans living in
France, which got into legal trouble because its website wasn't
written up primarily in French ?  99% of Australian websites are
probably illegal under this problem.  Ditto for most of the rest of
the world.

   I repeat virtully *ANY* website is illegal *SOMEWHERE* on this

Just for some further info, the interpretation of the *current*
Australian law meant that the court made the right decision, but the
whole issue of these laws and how they need to be updated for just
this sort of situation is (I believe) under way.

This decision is an example of 19th century precedents being applied
to the 21st century paradigm, and hopefully it will expedite changes
in law that will make some sense for the next 100 years or so.

Hopefully the whole issue will be no more than a temporary inconvenience
for web publishers everywhere.

Possible urban myth:

I once heard of someone that had a collision in a roundabout with a
car that was reversing around it at high speed, (the driver was
"hooning" around being a general nuisance).

The person, naturally, did not look for an oncoming vehicle from the
direction opposite to normal when entering the roundabout, and of
course was quite shocked when the other vehicle made contact!

The thing about it was that the person entering the roundabout was
found to "be in the wrong" and the reversing car's driver got off any
penalty, because the law here says "you must give way to any vehicle
already in the roundabout", and doesn't mention if it is going in the
other direction!

The point of USF is that your phone is more useful to you if there are
people you can call.  That's quite different from electric and gas
which would be equally useful to you even if you were the only
customer the electric company had.  E-Rate is a botch, but USF for
wider phone access still makes as much sense as it did in 1934.

switch and co-located ISP equipment.  But due to the relatively low
population density in this part of NY, it's still expensive to serve
customers here.

   What about long-distance bills ?  Say you're in southern Florida,
and you call another number "in the same area code".  When you get
your monthly phone bill, you find a line item for a 30-minute, prime
time, call to Hawaii or Alaska.  Oops.

Some people have brought up some notable exceptions to my assertion,
and I acknowledged up front that such exceptions existed. The bottom
line is that I could name a whole lot more examples of meaningless
brand names than anyone could name exceptions. That makes it a "rule"
of sorts.

There are many more examples than telecom in the world of meaningless
branding. Since I began with the naming of sports facilities, I'll
mention this: the San Jose Arena (home of the Sharks hockey team) sold
its name to Compaq. It is now called the "HP Pavillion" under the same
contract.

Yet another example of a meaningless brand name.

All Coke bottled outside of the US is cane sugar.

As is "kosher" Coke, which is produced in small quantities around
Passover for the Jewish folks.

It has to do with the sugar price supports for the growers in La. Sugar
is artificially high in the US price wise.

This has hit the Chicago area real hard, as there has been a steady
exodus of candy makers. 

Lifesavers, formerly based around the lake in Holland Mi was the most
recent big closure in the area.

It was interesting in a sad way, to watch the two Senate candidates in
the runoff, each talking about how well they supported their farmers,
despite the impact those policies have on the other 49 states.

That was a change in Federal law to deny air mail contracts to
airlines that were controlled by airframe or engine manufacturers,
because of a fear that unaffiliated airlines wouldn't be able to buy
aircraft or engines from manufacturers that had their own airlines.

What was left of Wards was taken over by GE (which was apparently owed
a lot of money for appliances); they finally went out of business this
past February, after 129 years.  Economist and conservative columnist
Thomas Sowell did a short piece on the end of Wards, which can be
found at http://www.capmag.com/articlePrint.asp?ID=864.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  Wards had its beginning in Chicago, 
on State Street downtown in the 1870's; I think around the time of
the great fire. They finally abandoned their downtown Chicago
operation after shoplifting  and other problems plagued State Street
during the 1970's. I think they were out of downtown Chicago as of
1978, although they kept their corporate offices in Chicago on the
near north side until the end. They had many, many stores in small
towns all over America even after 'conditions and circumstances' 
essentially forced them out of the Chicago business scene in 1978.

Well, they may still have offices downtown, but it is apparently a
mere shell of its old self now for quite a while.  We have friends who
were laid off when all the administrative work -- like payroll,
benefits, etc., went to Chicago.  And I understand they contracted a
lot of work to outside companies.  We heard horror stories of
employees being told their "attending physician" was miles and miles
away from their home or work because the droids who assigned the
doctors had no idea where different places were around here and their
software was so poorly written that it didn't point them to the
closest doctors.  (I won't get into the issue that the employees were
supposed to have completed a form giving a preference, so the only
ones this happened to were people who didn't know who to choose.)

It was around the time of the really big layoffs when they started
printing the "800" numbers in the phone book for repair and other
services from the company.  So instead of an easy-to-remember 3-digit
number, I had to put up another "cheatsheet" with such numbers because
they never deliver the number of phone books we want here any more.
Last summer we had to BEG for even ONE set because the droids they
hired didn't bother to deliver them to us.

Well, at least our phones do work most of the time.

During certain times of the year, you may also be able to buy Kosher
Coke that is sweetened with sugar instead of corn syrup.  Look for the
yellow caps.  (This is usually an annual thread in the ne.general
newsgroup when people report Kosher Coke sightings in the local
supermarkets.)

This is not a hazard at all, because these ATMs do not have any money
in them.  Usually when they are installed at festivals there is such a
run on them that they run out of money some time well before noon, and
then lots of disgruntled patrons start yelling about how they can't
get lunch now because the machine has run out of money.

People dragging the unit off and smashing it are more likely to be
angry people on sugar crashes who cannot get their lunch because the
machine has run dry again.

It does indeed seem that way.  Seeing as local calling within London
is now a mandatory 8 digits, it seems strange that so many folks don't
seem to get the point.  I can only put it down to the fact that (a)
people are so accustomed to seven-digit numbers in London that they
just can't get used to anything else, and (b) that people were
similarly conditioned into seeing area codes of the form 020x before
the "big change" and that 020 therefore looks strange to them.

And as is now required for all calls in France as well, where 01, 02,
03, 04, or 05 must be used ahead of the 8-digit number.  (The initial
zero being replaced with 4, 7 etc. for alternate carriers -- An
arrangement which seems rather peculiar from an Anglo-Saxon
perspective!)

Yes, the 00nx STD codes went years ago.  What I wasn't sure of is the
exact routing that would have been in place in Ireland.  Assuming that
there *were* some 00 codes in Northern Ireland (possibly Omagh for
one), then it's quite possible that many offices in the Irish Republic
originally dropped into a Northern Ireland trunk circuit as soon as
the caller dialed 080.  If it were done this way, then of course the
routing could well have been changed in recent years, but in many of
the small SxS offices (which survived in rural Eire until quite
recently) there would have been no point in going to the trouble of
changing.

I just put that forward as a contributory reason for the R.o.I. going
for 1800 instead of 0800 for toll free (although I don't dispute that
the cross-border advertising of numbers that Richard mentioned was
also a major factor).

Does anyone have the date for the implementation of 1800 (and 1850) in 
Ireland?

They go straight to any number of IXCs who offer 900 service. This 
service is provided on hicap directly to the companies using it, who 
also have to arrange and manage their own billing arrangements with the 
LECs or through the IXC itself.

Most of the LECs also offer LATA-wide 900 services, as SBC does in 
California.

The major telecoms will also provide 900 service.  AT&T's service is
called Multiquest.  I'm not sure what the other carriers call it.  AT&T
specifically doesn't allow people to run "adult services".

You may have problems going with AT&T though.  They announced a while ago
that they were getting out of the 900 service market at the end of 2002.  
Though I've been told they're not turning it all off then by people at
AT&T.  Probably just not taking new customers.

Subject: Why Pay When it's 'Free'?


This item was in the CSM on Monday. I thought it interesting and am
passing it along for group comment.
 
ptownson@sbcglobal.net has recommended this article from 
The Christian Science Monitor's electronic edition.

Headline:  Why pay when it's 'free'?
Byline:  Noel C. Paul Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
Date: 12/16/2002

Consumers disgruntled by a fee increase for certain services will often 
switch to a competitor or cancel.

Many, however, are turning to another option: stealing. A host of
businesses that facilitate consumer theft have sprung up in recent
years, say experts, largely in an effort to attract consumers
infuriated by what they perceive to be unfair prices.

The businesses primarily sell products that allow consumers to 
circumvent monthly bills for services such as cable and satellite 
television. Others offer information on how to avoid paying for home 
utilities and telephone bills.

Combined with consumers' widespread practice of distributing 
copyrighted music and movies over the Internet, the growing prominence 
of these "fraud services" has given rise to an increasingly pressing 
question: Are consumers growing more comfortable with committing theft?

Several experts believe the answer is yes, even though one result is an 
increase in fees for consumers who do pay their bills. "Many people, 
particularly young adults, don't see it as a right or wrong anymore, 
but in terms of what is most convenient for them," says Paul Witt, a 
communications professor at the University of Texas at Arlington.

The evolution of technology that often gives its users a veil of 
anonymity is largely responsible for changing consumers' standards, say 
experts.

But people are not committing fraud simply because technology has made
it possible. Their acts, say observers, are partly a defense of
long-held expectations. For more than 50 years, Americans have been
conditioned to expect entertainment services, in particular, that are
cheap or free.

Many believe that services are now priced so unfairly that theft has 
become a justifiable form of civil disobedience.

"People have gotten so used to getting things for free [that] they 
probably should be out there paying for, they've come to believe that 
that's the way it should be," says Bob Kruger, vice president of 
enforcement for the Washington-based Business Software Alliance (BSA).

Theft of cable and other mainstream services is not new, but the degree 
to which ordinary consumers are stealing appears to be growing, 
according to observers within several industries.

"These are people who wouldn't necessarily try to do this on [a regular 
basis]," says Ellen Silver, product manager of CyberSource, a financial 
transaction consultancy in Mountain View, Calif. "This is not their 
regular lifestyle."

The number of consumers stealing satellite TV service, for example, is 
expected to grow from 400,000 in 2000 to 5.4 million in 2009, says the 
Carmel Group, an electronics research group in Carmel, Calif.

The utilities, software, and telecommunications industries all report 
rising incidents of theft. In each of the latter two, the theft results 
in losses of $10 billion a year.

Masking intent?

Each of these industries blames the surge, in part, on businesses, 
primarily Internet-based, that instruct an audience of lay thieves in 
the art of stealing a particular service, or sell products that help 
accomplish the task.

Cable-descrambler boxes that are engineered to pick up every cable 
channel available in a given region are widely available online for 
about $300. Other sites sell similar software for satellite services 
for $150.

These businesses protect themselves against prosecution by posting 
disclaimers on their websites that say customers must report the use of 
these products to the local cable or satellite company to avoid 
breaking the law.

But the intent of the sites, many experts maintain, is clearly to sell 
products that abet consumer theft.

"You could theoretically buy a black box to enhance an old TV, but no 
one still uses them for that," says Marc Smith, spokesperson for the 
National Cable & Telecommunications Association in Washington.

People who would not normally consider stealing are doing so now partly 
because technology makes it so easy - and makes it seem so harmless.

Many end up stealing largely because of their instinct to get as much 
as they can out of technology. But increasingly, that causes them to 
run afoul of ethics.

One example: networks that give consumers wireless Internet in their 
home. Such "Wi-Fi" networks are so expansive they can sometimes be 
shared with a neighbor - saving him the cost of broadband Web access - 
without significantly slowing connections speeds.

Many people, particularly young adults, often assume that firms would 
not allow technology to accomplish a task if it weren't an acceptable 
use. "The technology is moving fast, and the legal system and 
educational system are not keeping up with it," says Mr. Kruger.

That is one reason the BSA - an organization known for doggedly 
pursuing prosecution of those who illegally distribute copyrighted 
software -- recently launched a softer agenda: publishing 
piracy-education material in "Weekly Reader" school magazines.

But studies show that even adults minimize the significance of
stealing services as opposed to tangible products.

In several surveys over the past decade, University of Mississippi
marketing professor Scott Vitell found that half of all consumers
believe that it is OK to steal a service that can be replicated
elsewhere -- like cable programming or digital music. Yet nearly all
of those people said stealing a can of soda, for example, was wrong.
"There's some notion that if the original is still available, you
haven't done anything wrong [by copying it]," says Mr. Vitell.

Consumers' failure to recognize the value of intellectual property, as
opposed to a tangible product, is rooted in historical precedent.

"For most of the 20th century ... consumers grew accustomed to
receiving [TV and radio] broadcasts for free, once having made the
initial investment in the receiver," says Michael Rappa, a professor
of technology management at North Carolina State University.

The same model was strengthened in the minds of younger consumers when 
most businesses on the Internet chose not to charge for access to their 
websites.

Consumers have also been given broad rights to save entertainment for 
future viewing. The most important case: Sony versus Universal City 
Studios, a 1984 decision that allowed consumers to record TV 
programming onto VHS cassettes without paying an added fee.

Because of this model for access, efforts by companies to charge a fee 
for entertainment have consistently been met with stiff resistance by 
many people.

Consumer psychologists call this response "psychological reactance." 
Whenever consumers' freedoms are challenged, the theory goes, they will 
go to great lengths to overcome the loss.

A 'right' to free services

"It is particularly true of Americans that whenever you try to take 
something away from them, they will do whatever they can to restore 
that freedom," says Larry Compeau, director of the Society for Consumer 
Psychology.

"When you begin to feel it's your right that [these services] should be 
free, if they start charging, maybe you don't feel any guilt in trying 
to evade that," says Vitell, the marketing professor.

The cable industry, for example, loses about $6.8 billion to consumer 
theft each year. Many experts cite rate increases as a key reason. 
Cable rates nationwide have jumped 45 percent in the past six years, 
according to Consumers Union.

Rather than sue their own customers, businesses must adapt their own
practices so they better fit consumer psychology, experts suggest.
"Folks who sell intellectual property have to adopt models that make
accessing entertainment feel virtually free," says Michael Carroll, a
law professor at Villanova University.

One example: Charging customers a one-time subscription fee of $5 to
download digital music. Under that scenario, music distributors will
be more able to replicate the feeling people expect of unlimited
access, without penalties.

Pat,

Interesting little anecdote about the phone!   These old stories are always 
fascinating.

I knew that many coin-phone lines were ground-start, but didn't they
just use a local rod for the ground connection rather than running a
third wire back to the CO's central ground?

I got the impression that this Verizon tech was talking about an
actual 3rd wire run right back to the exchange along with the normal
pair.  Maybe somebody misinterpreted that somewhere along the line.

By the way, the U.K. had ground-start on the two-way party lines that
were once quite common here for residential lines.  Phones on such
lines were fitted with a push-button and subscribers were instructed
to press it to obtain dialtone, after first checking that the line was
not already in use.  The "X" subscriber's button grounded the ring,
the "Y" subscriber's button grounded the tip side of the line.
Ringing was applied between ring and ground for the "X" sub, tip and
ground for the "Y" sub, and a local rod was used for the ground at
each house.


Paul Coxwell,
Norfolk, U.K.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Every old payphone I have ever seen
used a common rod staked into the ground. All the phones in the place
went to the common phone box for the building; all the pay phones had
their third-wire tied on a common terminal there, and that went to
the basement and a rod staked in the earth somewhere. Even single line
private phones which require ground start now have something similar.
The phone can ring in the usual way for incoming calls, but with no
incoming call, the line is totally dead. Not battery but no dial tone,
as is common on one-way inbound only phones, but totally dead; no side
tone, nothing. A small button on the phone has normally open contacts
inside the phone. Press the button, the contacts close for a second
or so, and ground comes through, triggers the line and allows dial
tone. That third-wire (usually black or yellow in the modular cord
since red/green are in normal use for the line) goes down to the phone
box on the floor where it meets other similarly situated lines and
then a common ground line runs off to the basement or some outside
place where it is staked in the ground also.  

I hear your next question:  who needs/wants a ground start line? Maybe
someone with a computer on the line which has a voice modem installed
in it; or one of those cards used for voicemail on the computer. If
the computer freezes or locks up the person does not want the phone
line to time out and provide dial tone to the person on the other end.
That's just one application.   PAT]

Subject: Soln: Lucent/AT&T  Four Line Analog Phone Won't Release Hold

Organization: Airnews.net! at Internet America


The most basic feature of multiline phones is 'hold'.  I can count on
trouble with this after any company move :-( We use analog four-line
phones plus one old Panasonic three-line.  Turns out only the
Panasonic senses the additional voltage drop when another extension
picks up, responding with a release of its own 'hold' load on that
line.  The Lucent 854 phones, though analog, employ digital status
information, sent _only_ on the first line!  We left line one
disconnected since the desks in question only had three telnums avail.
To that long long ago poster; sorry about the delay on this. <g>

Prepaid cell phones are sometimes used by people who do not want their
phone usage noticed, logged, etc.  Cell phone networks are being
upgraded to enable a given phone to be location to be tracked for 911
purposes etc.  Will that mean that someone can determine which phone
spends a lot of time in a particular location, therefore negating the
anonymity of the prepaid phone?

Well, if you paint the bulbs black, they won't be distracting.  Of
course, if you accept PAT's theory that black bulbs put out black light,
you might get a sunburn.

My wit must be sharpening - I did all that with just one post, whereas
previously I needed 5 or 6 posts per day to get under your skin.  :-)
Having John Higdon to practice on is a blessing in disguise, I
