Hi Markus,

I've replied to your posting on the DMDX list - since that way other people 
might get some benefit from my reply. Let me know if you have trouble 
reading my reply, or figuring out how the script works.

Also, I'm aware that you've just tried to subscribe to the DMDX list that I 
run in Cambridge. However, I'm reluctant to subscribe people outside 
Cambridge to this list, since this is primarily intended for local users. 
In particular people who use the DMDX set up at the Wolfson Brain Imaging 
Centre or at the Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit. I think that the main, 
official DMDX mailing list is much more appropriate for general queries 
such as yours.

Hope this helps,

Matt
