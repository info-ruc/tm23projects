Objet : [DMDX] blank screen between frames/items


Hi...

I'm using (attempting to use) DMDX in such a manner that a bitmap image
is displayed behind the text for a frame.  Once the user has made a
response, the following frame is an avi file.  The image just happens to
be the first frame of the video because I want the whole thing to seem
like an animation.

However, there is a gap (of blank screen) before the video frame is
played. What (anything) can be done to alleviate this?  Note that there
are no blank screen between frames just containing the image and text.
I tried preloading the video with a dud item & MediaLife but that didn't
make a difference.

Could an image be set as the background for all frames perhaps?

Any help would be appreciated,
Rua.
