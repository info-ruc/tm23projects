                            Globalization
	Over the years=2C advances in technology have aided in =

globalization by means of media=2E In the past it was primarily Western =

and American culture being spread out to other countries in the world=2E =

American culture is still rather predominate=2C but recently it seems as =

if Asian and other cultures=2C especially Japanese culture=2C has started=
 =

to expand to surrounding cultures and towards the west=2E Japanese =

culture has had an impact in American through anime=2E In Hawaii not =

only has Japanese culture been spread through anime=2C but also by tv =

shows=2E Different mediums of globalization will be discussed to show =

how this process occurs=2E These movements of globalization show that =

Western culture is dominate=2C although not completely dominate=2C becaus=
e =

there is a large mix of other cultures involved in this process of =

globalization=2E
	Japanese culture has used anime to work its way into American =

society through media=2E Anime has become widely popular all over the =

United States=2E The first article explains that people of all ages and =

genders have come to enjoy these Japanese cartoons=2E People all over =

enjoy movies=2C tv shows=2C books=2C and comics by anime=2E People like a=
nime =

because the characters are very human like both appearance and emotion =

and the story lines are fun and exciting to both children and adults=2E =

Anime has combined the American themes of  heroes fighting evil with =

Japanese culture and martial arts=2E It seems as if this combination is =

a big part of why anime has been so widely accepted in America=2E =

	Japanese culture has had its largest impact in Hawaii through =

television shows=2E The second article talks about the popularity of =

Kikaida in Hawaii=2E Although it was primarily popular back in the =

1970s=2C its popularity is still ever so present today=2E Last year my =

senior class did a Kikaida skit for a school banquet=2C and it was a hit =

with the student body and their guests=2E Fans of Kikaida can relate to =

his human side=2C and think his mechanical side is cool=2E Similar to =

anime=2C it is a mixture of the American idea of a hero fighting for =

moral reasons=2C Japanese martial arts=2C and the whole technological par=
t =

of it appeals to the advancing technology of the world=2E Soap operas =

and other television series have also aided in the spread of Japanese =

culture=2E The third article discusses the soap opera=2C Oshin=2C and its=
 =

popularity in Iran=2E In Hawaii not only Japanese=2C but also Korean soap=
 =

operas have become very popular among both men and women of different =

races=2C not just Asians=2E =

	The participation of Asian culture in this whole globalization =

process has been discussed=2C however it is not the only cultural =

influence in this process=2E The easiest way to show evidence of =

globalization is not necessarily from specific types of cultures that =

influence and spread out to other cultures=2E But instead to discuss the =

medium which allow this to all happen=2E The major medium would =

obviously be pop culture and media=2E This entails things such as music=2C=
 =

television shows=2C movies=2C and fashion=2E Music is the universal =

language=2E Not everyone speaks the same language or understands the =

English language=2E However anyone can communicate through music=2E =

Origins of music come from all over the world=2C many of which came out =

of Africa=2E Music touches people on an emotional level=2C way beyond tha=
t =

of a scientific or physical level=2E People are able to appreciate music =

from another culture=2C which opens the door to let a little bit of that =

different culture to influence one=92s own lifestyle=2E Examples of this =

are the Latin invasion into the United States with Ricky Martin and =

Jennifer Lopez=2C Japan=92s appreciation for classical European music=2C =
and =

Asia=92s infatuation with American pop and country music=2E Many Asian =

countries have their own musicians which tend to emulate the popular =

musicians of America=2E Another example is the whole trance and techno =

genre which traveled from Europe to America and the further to =

countries all over the world=2E
	Television is such a widespread medium of globalization=2E When =

one turns on the TV in Hawaii there are specific Korean=2C Japanese=2C =

Chinese=2C and Filipino channels=2E On the mainland Spanish channels and =

the BBC are more prevalent over Asian channels=2E However there are =

Korean television stations in California=2C Washington=2C and New York=2E=
 =

Many of the game shows which are popular in America today originated =

out of Britain=2E Game shows such as The Weakest Link and Who Wants to =

Be a Millionaire both originated from the United Kingdom=2E Soap operas =

are also a globalization device=2E In Hawaii many Asian soaps are =

popular=2C in the mainland Spanish soaps are popular=2C and American soap=
s =

such as The Bold and the Beautiful are simulcasted in Spanish=2E =

	Movies are another big part of globalization=2E Western-American =

movies tend to be the most popular all around the world=2E Most of the =

time one will see American movie stars and celebrities going to other =

countries to promote their movies=2E One rarely sees foreign celebrities =

promoting movies in America=2E American celebrities are most popular =

among celebrities of the world=2E However there certain film festivals =

in Europe which bring together people in the movie industry from all =

over the world=2E At these festivals unique and cultural movies are =

shown and this where people are able to influence and be influenced=2E =

Also every once in awhile there will be a movie from another country =

that will make it big in the United States=2E An example of this is the =

remake of the recent movie=2C The Ring=2C which was originally a Japanese=
 =

horror film=2E This film was redone in English and did fairly well in =

American movie theaters=2E
	Fashion is another major part of media that aids in =

globalization=2E Fashion and outer appearance is such a superficial but =

important part of today=92s society=2E The fashion capitals of the world =

are Paris=2C France and Milan=2C Italy=2E Major designers are Versace=2C =

Armani=2C Gucci=2C Prada=2C Dolce and Gabbana=2C Ralph Lauren=2C and Fend=
i=2C many =

of which come out of Europe=2E The designs and clothing of these =

designers are very popular throughout the world=2C primarily in Europe=2C=
 =

the United States=2C and Asia=2E Supermodels that show off and model =

clothing from these designers also come from all over the world=2E They =

come from the United States=2C Brazil=2C India=2C Germany=2C Scotland=2C =
France=2C =

England=2C Czech Republic=2C and from so many other places=2E These women=
 =

are looked up to by girls and women all over the world=2E These models =

are a picture of what most women would like to be or look like=2E So it =

is clear how fashion puts its two cents into the large scale of world-
wide globalization=2E
	Another medium through which globalization occurs has to do =

with lifestyle and culture=2E Food is a major globalization tool=2E =

Everyday people eat food=2C and they like to eat all different kinds of =

food=2E Just about everyone loves Chinese take out food=2C sushi=2C and =

pizza and pasta=2E These types of food come from all over the world=2E =

Popular foods today are Italian=2C Greek=2C Indian=2C Chinese=2C Japanese=
=2C =

Mexican=2C and French food=2E These are just a few of the types of food =

that there are and that people enjoy eating=2E Food brings with it the =

culture it came from=2E For example when someone goes to eat sushi=2C the=
y =

cannot sit there and eat it with a fork=2E They will attempt to use =

chopsticks=2C therefore exploring into another culture=2E Interior design=
 =

is another lifestyle affiliated medium of globalization=2E Popular =

designs of today have and Indian and Asian influence=2E Feng Shui is =

such a popular and recent trend in interior design=2C and this came out =

of China=2E
	On top of all of the different ways that the world is =

globalized=2C there will always be one common interest among all =

nations=2C and that is money=2E Money and people own self-interest in =

gaining money will always connect different nations together=2E Trading =

with another country will always be a way of sharing culture as well =

as imported and exported goods=2E Trading is the earliest from of =

culture globalization=2E This goes way back in history especially =

dealing with the Mediterranean Ecumene=2E The word =93ecumene=94 means =93=
one =

common world=94 specifically dealing with cultural aspects=2E The reason =

why countries and nations around the Mediterranean Sea formed this =

common little world was through trade=2E All of these nations traded =

with one another opening the door for the sharing of cultures as well =

as goods=2E =

	It seems as if advances in technology have really helped make =

globalization easier in today=92s society=2E The world is so connected by=
 =

news=2C tv=2C movies=2C magazines=2C and the internet=2C that is too hard=
 not to =

be globalized=2E This seems to be a good thing rather than a bad thing =

because the world is better globalized than separated=2E If each nation =

or country did not interact with other countries things would get =

rather boring=2E People would just have the same thing in their life=2C =

and would have no variety=2E The world would be a globe of individual =

separate nations=2E It is like having a room full of 25 unique and =

different people and not allowing them to talk to one another and =

share things between them=2E They would all be close together in the =

same room=2C but would be separate=2C and that is no fun at all=2E =

	Some sociologist believe that the world revolves around =

Western culture and all are adapting to it=2E This statement or belief =

is not very valid=2E It might have been valid in the past when Western =

nations were prospering and being the leader of the pack=2E In the past =

other nations looked towards Western culture to learn=2C but they did =

not necessarily adopt its culture=2E Today it seems that although =

Western culture is predominant=2C it is not overly predominate=2E There =

seems to be a nice=2C balanced mixing of cultures=2E Each nation has its =

own culture and traditions=2E While it shares its culture and =

experiences other cultures=2C it maintains its tradition=2E
	In the past that Western culture was being spread and =

partially adopted by other countries=2E Today other cultures are being =

exposed to the rest of the world through media by anime and tv shows=2E =

Even though Japanese culture is seen by Americans through these tv =

shows and cartoons=2C it is not being accepted or adopted by society=2C =

like American culture has been emulated by other countries in the =

past=2E Although other countries enjoy many things from American =

culture=2C it does not mean that American culture is dominating over =

other cultures=2E American culture is more looked upon for being more =

modern and having technological advancements=2C rather than its =

traditions and values=2E Other countries strive to be as modern as the =

United States and adopt some of its values=2C but those countries have =

their own traditions and values acquired through its history=2E  Overall =

it just seems as if technology has allowed different cultures to be =

exposed by means of entertainment that everyone around the world =

enjoys=2E It gives people a glimpse of other cultures=2C while they =

maintain their own culture=92s traditions and values=2E
