I think it is worth investigating the use of LOX/KERO as propellants
for single stage to orbit (SSTO) vehicles. Attached is a postscript
file which shows delta V versus propellant volume/final mass ratio.
As can be seen, in terms of propellant volume LOX/KERO (or H2O2/KERO)
is significantly better than LOX/LH2 (all the way to orbital speeds
of 9000 to 10,000 m/s).

The numbers I used were

                   v_e (m/s)   d_p (kg/l)    MR   Mass (kg)  Engine
H2O2/KERO     3042       1.314         7.2   8755       RD-170 (calculated)
LOX/KERO        3305       1.025        2.6   8755       RD-170
LOX/LH2          4441       0.3611      6.0   3177       SSME

where v_e is the exhaust speed, d_p is the propellant density, and
MR is the mixture ratio.

The VentureStar has the following specifications (1 t = 1000 kg)

m_e  =   89.8 t (empty mass)
m_p  =  875.0 t (propellant mass)
m_c  =   26.8 t (cargo mass)
m_t  =  991.6 t (total liftoff mass)
F_s  = 13,419 kN (sea level thrust)
v_es =   3403 m/s (sea level exhaust speed)
v_ev =   4462 m/s (vacuum exhaust speed)
V_p  =   2423 m^3 (propellant volume)

The total delta V for the vehicle is

dV = 4462 ln(1+ 875.0/(89.8 + 26.8)) = 9551 m/s

The liftoff acceleration (ignoring gravity) is

a = F_s/m_t = 13,419/991.6 = 13.53 m/s^2

Let us assume that the propellant volume flow rate through the
LOX/KERO and LOX/LH2 engines is constant. Then the liftoff thrust
for an equivalent LOX/KERO engine is

F_s2 = (d_p2/d_p1) (v_e2/v_e1) F_s1
     = (1.025/0.3611) (3032/3403) 13,419
     = 33,938 kN

The sea level v_e of the RD-170 is 3032 m/s. This thrust is about the 
same as the Saturn V. Let us assume that the liftoff acceleration is 
the same, thus

m_t2 = F_s2/a = 33,938/13.53 = 2507.8 t

Assuming the same delta V (the actual delta V will be lower due
to the larger thrust and thus smaller gravity losses) we have

9551 = 3305 ln(1+ m_p2/m_f2)
2507.8 = m_p2 + m_f2

where m_f2 = m_e2 + m_c2. Solving we have m_p2 = 2368.4 t and
m_f2 = 139.4 t. The tank volume is V_p2 = 2368.4/1.025 = 2311 m^3
which is 112 m^3 smaller than VentureStar. The final mass of
VentureStar is m_f1 = 89.8 + 26.8 = 116.6 t. Thus, the new design
will have a final mass that is 22.8 t greater than VentureStar.
Unfortunately, this greater mass can not be converted into payload
mass since the engine mass for the new design is greater than for
VentureStar.

For the RD-170 the engine mass to sea level thrust ratio is
8755/7259 = 1.206 kg/kN. I don't know this ratio for the VentureStar
engines so I'll take the figures for the SSME which are
3177/1668 = 1.905 kg/kN. Thus the engine mass for the new design
is 33,938 x 1.206 = 40.9 t and for the VentureStar the mass is
13,419 x 1.905 = 25.6 t. Thus, the new design requires an increased
engine mass of 40.9-25.6 = 15.3 t which reduces the extra payload
mass to orbit to 22.8-15.3 = 7.5 t. Let us use this mass for the
stronger thrust structure. Thus, with a 26.8 t payload (the same
as VentureStar) we have that the empty mass of the new design is
139.4-26.8 = 112.6 t (of which 36.3% is engine mass). This compares
to the empty mass of 89.8 t of VentureStar (of which 28.5% is
engine mass). Despite the higher empty mass the new design will be
slightly smaller dimensionally due to the smaller tank volume.

So there you go. If reduced gravity losses reduce the delta V by
500 m/s (Mitchell Burnside Clapp showed that a H2O2/KERO powered
SSTO reduces delta V by 595 m/s) then the empty mass can increase
to 135.4 t (of which 30.2% is engine mass) with a 26.8 t payload.
The tank volume is 2288 m^3 (135 m^3 smaller than VentureStar).

So, I think a LOX/KERO SSTO is technically feasible but the large
engine mass could be a problem. Still, it may be desirable to make
a LOX/KERO SSTO work due to the operational advantages it offers. KERO
is much easier to work with than LH2. The propellant costs will also
be less which in a resuable system (like airplanes) will hopefully
be a large part of the cost of a launch.

worth working into a updated site.




Date:  Mon, Sep 16, 1996 11:40 AM EST
From:  MbClapp
Subj:  Answer to your question on Usenet RE Airdrop vs. Retanking
To:      Kelly St

     There has been a great deal of work done on 
examining space access concepts that are based on air 
launch as a means of reducing Delta-V to orbit to a 
level that reduces the performance requirements on a 
launch vehicle. Essentially, subsonic staging provides 
benefits over single stage to orbit in several areas. 
The gravity losses are reduced because the vehicle is 
in horizontal flight, supporting itself by aerodynamic 
means rather than by engine thrust. The drag losses 
are reduced as well. Above 18,000 feet, over half the 
atmosphere is beneath you. The back pressure losses on 
the engines are also reduced because the limit for no 
separated nozzle flow permits larger expansion 
engines. Finally, there is the possibility of staging 
above weather, an operational advantage.

     Relatively little work has examined the 
possibility of inflight propellant transfer as an 
alternative to air launch, however. The reasons for 
this are unclear. The inflight propellant transfer 
concept does offer five distinct advantages over air 
launch.

     First of all, the experience base in military 
aviation with inflight propellant transfer is 
enormously greater than that for air launch. Perhaps 
four hundred manned aircraft have ever been released 
from beneath other aircraft. A similar number of 
inflight propellant transfers are performed each day. 
And the number of stores in excess of 50,000 pounds 
that have been released from aircraft total a few 
dozen at most. Every modern military aircraft can be 
refueled in flight, and for many missions it is 
critical. "Take off, top off and continue with the 
primary mission" is an everyday operation in the US 
Air Force.

     Second, the separation of two large objects in 
flight is an inherently risky maneuver. Stores 
certification history for military aircraft is full of 
examples of released objects striking the parent 
aircraft and causing major damage. The risk can be 
minimized by a number of means, including captive 
carry testing, wind tunnel work, and build-up flight 
test, but at some point the certification program must 
commit to releasing the object â€“ an all-or-nothing 
affair. This level of risk can be managed, but doing 
so drives costs up. Propellant transfer, on the other 
hand, can be certified by slowly and incrementally 
flying formation, then near the tanker, then in dry 
contact with the tanker, then with increasing amounts 
of propellant transfer, opening the envelope in a very 
gradual fashion. Inflight refueling accidents are 
unheard of in flight test. It is a safer activity to 
certify.

     Third, the performance of an air-launch system 
is subject to some important limitations. Because two 
airframes are under the influence of one set of 
engines, the aircraft cannot climb quite as high for 
separation as an inflight propellant transfer concept 
can. The interference drag between the two airframes 
also limits the envelope of the ensemble to some 
degree. The effect is not enormous, adding up to an 
advantage of perhaps 250 ft/sec of Delta-V to the 
inflight propellant transfer concept, but it is 
noticeable. 

     Fourth, the inflight propellant transfer 
concept offers some important advantages in 
flexibility. The orbital aircraft has the capability 
to fly suborbital missions without propellant 
transfer, to distances of 3,000 to 6,000 nautical 
miles, depending on the aerodynamic configuration. 
This capability exists because the airframe is capable 
of independent takeoff and landing. This offers a 
transcontinental range for a number of alternate 
missions that are difficult to imagine for an air 
launch concept. For the same reason, the tanker and 
orbital aircraft may be based at different locations, 
and interfaced only in flight. This offers more basing 
flexibility and removes the requirements for 
specialized facilities and ground support equipment 
such as that needed to mate the Shuttle orbiter to its 
carrier aircraft.

     Finally, the carrier aircraft for an air 
launch concept must be either an entirely new aircraft 
or a major, airworthiness affecting structural 
modification to an existing aircraft (unless the gross 
weight of the orbital segment is very small). The 
carrier must bear not only the weight of the 
propellant, but also the empty weight of the aircraft 
as well as its payload. The orbital aircraft must be a 
great deal smaller than its carrier for an air-launch 
concept, while it can be larger than the tanker (or 
tankers) for an inflight propellant transfer concept. 
This drives the designer to very large carrier 
aircraft, which can be expensive.

I agree with a lot of this, especial the contrast of space advocacy groups 
vrs the federalist group.  But I'm much less optimistic about NASA after the 
SLI (space launch initiative) reports came in.  They again focused on very 
old crude designs, optimized for NASA's needs, and not optimized for 
practicality or commercial adaptability.  I mean when your bold new idea is 
mini-shuttle on the tip of multistage expendable booster?!  That was a old 
Air force proposal for a X-15 spin off in the mid '60's!  NASA might want to 
at least look at concepts like Blackhorse the airforce came up with a decade 
or two ago!!

NASA needs to be more of a aeronautical research org.  One supporting 
aeospace and space launch systems.  Not just eternal research on 
technollogies decades away from use, but trying to get something developed 
and runing now that could really make a difference.  Top on the list for 
space is a versital, relyable, low cost, space launcher.

Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2002 16:00:10 EST

Worked this up a while ago.  Its more then a little rough, but might be 
interesting.



================

Was looking over SeaDragon statistics from those URL's I posted. 
Liftoff Thrust is 36,000,000 kgf, or about 36,000 tons.  The saturn 5's F-1's 
were about 780,000 kgf.  So you'ld need about 46 of them.  Good thing you 
launch them in the deep ocean.  The sound of 10 Saturn 5's taking off at once 
would play hell with anything breakable in the county.  John Chancelor was 
there for one of the forst Sat-V test launches.  The vibration shook apart 
the viewing stands set up for the reporters.  In colapsed under them adn they 
scrambled for safy.  He remembers sprawling out on the ground as it shok 
under him and he watch that giant take off.  Next time the moved the stands 
back a mile.

Anyway thats a lot of noise.  Its also a lot of engines.  Then I remembered a 
stat on injector ramjet engines.  The injectors could "entrain" in 20 times 
the exaust mass gas'es mass of air.  Thus driving a BIG ramjet/scramjet engin
e with 2 or 3 F-1 engines.  Has to be simpler to build a  36,000,000 kgf 
suite of  ramjets/scramjets then a rocket wityh that size.  Also lightens the 
take off weight by a rediculas amount.  Also given the first stage (if i did 
the math right given the burn out times adn DV given the rocket equation) 
cuts out at about Mach-6.

=================

Sea Dragon-first stage
Gross Mass  11,600,000 kg.  
Empty Mass    1,300,000 kg. 

Thrust (vac)    36,400,000 kgf. 
Isp     290 sec.             [[ 300 -360 (vac) or so is normal ]]
Burn time     81 sec. 

Propellants     Lox/Kerosene    Isp(sl) 200 sec.

Diameter    21.5 m.
Span        30.0 m.
Length      68.0 m.


Comments    Sea level thrust shown. Thrust, chamber pressure varies during 
ascent. Vacuum thrust at cut-off 40 million kgf. Total mass, specific impulse 
estimated from booster performance figures. 

>>>> speed at stage 1 burn out???
The classic rocket equation gives the fuel to ship mass ratio, needed to get 
a given change in speed, with a fuel that has a given exaust velocity. 

dv = Desired change (or delta) in the ships speed.
Vexh = Exaust velocity of the material  (290 x 9.8m/s) = 2842
M = The fuel mass ratio =Exp(dV/Vexh)


Liftoff Thrust: 36,000,000 kgf. 
Liftoff Total Mass:     18,000,000 kg.
fuel mass first stage   10,300,000 kg. 
mass at stage 1 burnout   7,700,00

m =  M liftoff / (M liftoff - M fuel )  = 18,000,000 / 7,700,000

dv - Vexh  ln ( m ) - gt

dv = Vexh  ln (m ) - gt  = 2,413 - gt  = 2,413m/s - (9.8 x 81 ) = 1,619m/s

2,413m/s  = 5,212 m/hour  about mach 7
1,619m/s =  3497 m/hour  about  mach 5

================

Also noticed the Sea Dragon's first stage motor was expected to give 290 sec 
of  ISP  the F-1s were Isp (vac): 304 sec. Isp (sea level): 265 sec.   And 
the first stage had a bout a 10-1 fuel mass ratio.  If you lose most all of 
the LOx, you might spend it on Wings to lower take off thrust needs (and 
noise) and since its seaworthy, your not paying a weight price for seaplane 
abilities.  

Secound stage is Sea Dragon-second stage has a 

Gross Mass:     5,900,000 kg. 
Empty Mass:        530,000 kg. 



Thrust (vac):   6,350,000 kgf.   or about 8 F-1 engines
Isp:        320 sec.           [[ LH/LOx engine usually give 440-460!!]]
Burn time:  260 sec. 

Propellants:    Lox/LH2 


320 isp with LOx/LH??  Thats hardly better then the numbers for the 
LOx/Kerosine engines of the '60's?  Its actually worse then the current gen 
of LOx/Kero engines which get up to 350 isp!  Shuttle LOx/LH engines get 
about 450isp!


Anyway

>>>> stage 2 delta-V capacity ???
dv = Desired change (or delta) in the ships speed.
Vexh = Exaust velocity of the material  (320 x 9.8m/s) = 3136m/s
m = The fuel mass ratio =Exp(dV/Vexh)

m =  M liftoff / (M liftoff - M fuel )  = 5,900,000 / 530,000 = 11.1

dv = Vexh  ln ( m ) =   3136m/s  ln ( 11.1 )  = 7548 m/s

>>>>>>>>

Given liquid hydrogens (LH) huge bulk and tank weight, not to mention cost, 
I'm thinking a pure LOx/Kerosine TSTO system makes more sence?  Up the number 
of F-1s from 2-3 for the first stage to 8 (most of which arn't turned on 
until you leave the air), and you have the thrust.


Ok, Sea Dragons second stage had a 

Gross Mass:     5,900,000 kg. 
Empty Mass:        530,000 kg.

Mass of the fuel tanks would be less without the LH.  But the LEO Payload was 
450,000 kg.  (550 tons), so your only talking about 80 tons of structure to 
orbit.

Total Liftoff  Mass was 18,000,000 kg. 

Sea Dragon-first stage
Gross Mass  11,600,000 kg.  
Empty Mass    1,300,000 kg.

Course that 10,300,000 kg of LOx and Kerosine can be reduced by a factor of 
3.5 or so if you assume airbreathing.  Thats down to 2,940,000 kg.  That 
frees up a lot  weight for structure or extra fuel.  If you can take off HTOL 
you can assend more slowly on your wings until you get to high altitudes for 
your big run to speed.  Saving more in fuel.

A 747 has a empty weight about half its max takeoff weight.  Course it has to 
takeoff at slower speeds.  I think lift is one of those V^2 things.  Given 
the size of this monster, it can handal light seas at speed.  Probably lift 
off into its ground effect, then run up into far high speeds for assent.  
(lots of open ocean out there.)  So possibly tripling its speed to 450-500ish 
mph could get you 9 times the take off weight?  That big Russuan surface 
effect ship had numbers like that.

If true the winged vehicle can lift maybe 10 times its dry weight.

First stage fuel        2,940,000 kg

2nd stage fuel and LOX  5,370,000 kg.

Cargo              450,000 kg.  (550 tons)

total - structure       8,760,000 kg

So if  you can do a 9 to 1 take off to empty weigh ratio, you need about 
100,000 kg.  for plane and drive & lift stuff.

Sea Dragon had   1,300,000 plus 370,000 kg. or 1,670,000  

Course eliminating the LOx from the first stage would cut at least half of 
the weight out of the first stage.  Getting you  under 1,000,000 total 
structure and systems.  You can lose 100,000 kg of flight structure in there 
pretty easy, but you just doubled the dry weight to orbit.  Doubling the dry 
weight to orbit would double the fuel load you'ld need to carry.  You might 
save more weight from less thrust needed for a HTOL, or by airbreathing 
longer. Or you could switch to higher efficency LH/LOx for the post 
atmosphere boost, or build the hull out of something lighter then plate 
steel.  The Russuans built whole attack subs out of titanium, so something of 
the weight of this is possible, and would more then halve the weight.  It 
also is more heat and corrosion resistent.   Pricy though.  Don't know how 
much off hand.

But anyway halving the structure weight by switch from '60's steel shouldn't 
be a big problem.

If you stick to Kerosine / LOx all around.  Thats about:

 4,480,000 kg of kerosine   $ 0.20 per kg   = $816,000
3,900,000 kg of LOx $ 0.08 per kg   = $312,000


Course thats not much of the cost of a launch now, but in mature systems it 
gets to be up to a 1/3rd.

Dev costs?  About all complex aircraft from RLV's to F-22s adn B-2s seem to 
be in the $10-$20 billion club now a days.

At 500 tons cargo to LEo per flight.  Our 3 million ton O'Neil would eat 
6,000 flights to LEO just for the material, and could take more then that for 
the support stuff to fly it to L5.  So even if we assume $60 billion in dev 
costs and only 6,000 total flights, the overhead costs should only be about a 
million dollars a flight.  About the same as the fuel costs.  Together only 
about $2 per pound of cargo to orbit.

Servicing for launch was estimated in the tens of million of dollars per 
launch by seadragon.  Course that was nearly 40 years ago, with a differnt 
configuration.  Not sure how to guess for this.

The problem with Rocket design is because things are so sensitive to
the isp factor a minor change can throw a design right out the window.
I think a smallish designed craft can be optinum for mass/payload in
the 800 kg/2400 kg range providing the second stage is unmanned to
a fixed space platform. Has any work on a third stage using microwave
or solar powered engine that stays in orbit and captures the second
stage?
1st stage -- air breathing/wings manned
2nd stage -- payload pod /winged reentry
3rd stage == booster shuttle/space frame

ISP isn't a critical cost factor, though you need to avoid designs with ISP to do it.

Its worth noting that airbreathing systems have ISP's in the thousands, so they make up for a lot of upper stage issues.

As to solar or microwave upper stages, only for orbit to orbit transfers.  They simply don't mave the raw power needed for burning into Earth orbit.

Their was some studies of a mid orbit intercept by a nuclear powered tug.  In theory you could do a factor of ten increase  cargo to orbit with a rocket based SSTO, overloaded into a suborbital capacity to intercept the boster tug.  NOt real sure I'ld recomend the idea though.  might as well just add the nuke to the upper stage or cary more fuel, and deal with a simpler system.

Hi everyone,
I just read the Fall 94 "Journal of practical applications in space".  (Yeah,
I know I'm behind.)  I finally finished Philip Chapman's artical on Reviving
Spaceflight.  It had some good ideas, but had bad writing.  One idea he had
sounded like half a good idea, and I wanted to know if anyone
confirmed/picked it apart yet.  

The idea was that given a basic SSTO at launch is 90% fuel, 9% ship, and 1%
cargo by weight.  (Its not quite that bac, but close.)  If you launch it to a
suborbital speed that takes 10% less fuel and have a orbital tug come down
and take the cargo (or give the ship a boost) you can save 9% of the total
weight and can get a tenfold upgrade in cargo capacity.  (1% standard cargo
capacity + the 9% saved fuel alotment.)  

Now he fiqured out that this could require 40% of your launches to be fuel
for the tug (specifically water to be processed into fuel), but he didn't
seem to realize that a 10% cut in orbital speed wouldn't save you 10% of your
fuel.
  
Anybody have any ideas as to how much fuel you could save?  Or for that
matter how much speed you could sacrafice and still have a reasonable chance
of intercept and boost?  The trick sounds like it could be usefull
(especially later if you get a nuclear rocket tug or Lunar water to cut down
up mass) but I wonder if he messed up his math somewhere.

Anyway thought somebody might know offhand, or just be curious. 


Subj:  Re:SSTO + Tug launcher?

On your SSTsub-O w/Tug idea, I ran some numbers:
At lift-off, 90K of fuel, 9K of structure, and 10K of payload.  With LOX/LH2, 
that ought to leave you just 6,000 fps shy of LEO.  A tug with 5.5K of fuel 
and 0.55K of structure could boost your 10K payload up to LEO.  For 
simplicity, let's say that the previous payload supplies the fuel.  10K 
payload minus 5.5K for fuel minus 0.3K of fuel to take the Tug from LEO to a 
rendezvous trajectory minus 0.2K for a fuel container, leaving 4K of usable 
payload.  That's a four-fold increase, IT WORKS!

All-

Time for a reality check...

If you are going to even think about nuclear powered rockets in any
capacity, you might as well go for broke. DUMBO was the (potential)
successor to NERVA and is easily buildable today. It has both sufficient ISP
and sufficiently high thrust (it takes both) to make an SSTO design doable
with LARGE payload capacities. No need for mid-orbit tug transfers, etc.

Now for the reality part, if you have to fight tooth and nail just to get an
RTG mission like Cassini off the ground, getting routine flights to orbit
(or mid-orbit transfers) with a nuclear powered rocket are, frankly,
impossible.

Lots of scientists and engineers have run the numbers and the risk is low,
the amount of contamination if the worst happens is low, in fact, this
should be a no brainer. Unfortunately, the anti-nuclear lobby has done a
VERY good job of playing to the public's fear. So much so that I suspect
that even if we were to come up with some sort of cold fusion
non-radioactive engine, it STILL wouldn't be politically acceptable.

Might as well wish for anti-gravity, at least the public thinks that is
cool!

Uh, Ben, except for the part about stages, aren't you talking about something like the Rotary? You remember the Rotary, don't you -- goes up, gets low orbit, comes down -- all by itself. I think it was called "SSO." Damn shame about Rotary, but really, they didn't have a chance, due to their payload limit. Customers will demand payloads in the largest chunks they can, to avoid needing such fancy maneuvers as orbital assembly. They must figure it's the cheaper deal. Anyway, you're back to having to think big.

Sorry thats a myth.  We have a estimated 4 centuries of oil if consumption 
grows at current rates.

But that would require the tug to then reboost itself even more, before 
rentering.  It might be dangerous, or completly cancel out the advantage of 
using the tug.

Most of the small launchers like Rotary, Pineer, Kelly, etc were hunting for 
the Irridium launch market for small sats  Problem was, Irridium and that 
market fell on its face.  So they all died.

Good point about the politics.  Course you could simply flag it out of 
another country that doesn't worry about such things.  Or get a powerfull 
enough backer to ignor the Eco-nuts.

Certainly nuclear power is critical if we ae to do any deep space stuff.  
Even manmed flights to Mars would be far to risky and dificult without nukes. 
 So if you can't get nukes, you can't do space.

To dangerous and unstable.  I doubt it would be competative with fusion.

Other than anti-matter induced fusion regular fusion does not look
to have the mass/thust ratio needed. Also anti-matter fusion looks
practial in the near future compared to the +20 years for conventional
development.
