Hi Jonathan,

I am using the largest version of DMDX.  I tried the different strategies
you suggested (initializing digitalvox before record vocal, commenting out
record vocal, not running record vocal on legacy mode), and these didn't
work.  We have been able to record voice responses on wav files with no
problem, it's just that DMDX is not outputting RTs of voice responses on
the .azk file (only the delay time gets outputted).  I got a colleague's
rtf file (which is running properly on his machine), and ran it in my
machine and still did not get RTs outputted in the .azk file.  How is it
that wav files are recorded but not the RTs?  Any further help would be
appreciated.

Thanks,
Edelyn
