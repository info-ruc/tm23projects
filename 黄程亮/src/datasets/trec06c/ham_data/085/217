By Associated Press

WASHINGTON -- The FBI arrested a Russian college student Thursday who
was accused of stealing and distributing hundreds of secret documents
about new antipiracy technology from DirecTV, the nation's leading
satellite television company.

The student, identified as Igor Serebryany, 19, of Los Angeles, was
accused of sending over the Internet hundreds of sensitive documents
describing details about DirecTV's latest "access card" technology --
credit-card devices controlling which of the company's 11 million
U.S. subscribers can view particular channels.

Subject: $100K Reward for Stolen ID Data


By Associated Press
01:55 PM Jan. 02, 2003 PT

PHOENIX -- A government contractor posted a $100,000 reward Tuesday 
in the theft of Social Security numbers and other personal records of 
500,000 military service members and their families in 16 states.

The theft of computer hard drives from TriWest Healthcare Alliance 
could turn into one of the largest identity thefts on record if the 
information is misused, the Federal Trade Commission said.

On Tuesday, prosecutors and TriWest jointly announced the reward for 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of thieves who broke 
into Phoenix-based TriWest's office Dec. 14 and stole the equipment.

The theft came as the Defense Department is working to computerize 
the medical records of all military personnel.

The stolen computers have no connection to the larger project, but 
Pentagon officials are "going to learn from this issue and do what's 
necessary" to protect sensitive information, spokesman Jim Turner 
said.

The stolen hard drives contained names, addresses, phone numbers, 
medical claim histories and Social Security numbers.

Subject: Out the Door


By BOB HERBERT

Merry Christmas. Get lost.

That, essentially, was the message Robert Pagein received from his 
employers -- make that former employers -- at Verizon Communications.

Mr. Pagein, who is married and has a year-old son, was a field
technician who had worked for the phone company for four years. One of
the lures of the job was its stability. The pay wasn't great, but it
was steady. If you were disciplined you could pay your bills, take a
vacation every year or so, and put a little aside.

That's the way it works in theory. In reality, Mr. Pagein was one of
2,400 Verizon workers in New York who were shown the door just a few
days before Christmas. Those workers formed the bulk of a pre-holiday
wave of terminations that claimed the jobs of 3,500 Verizon employees
in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states.

Mr. Pagein will not be destitute. His wife is working and he has a
college degree. But the cold-blooded way in which he and his fellow
workers were lopped off the employment rolls by Verizon, and the
phenomenal gap that exists between the compensation available to the
company's ordinary workers and the fabulous, multimillion-dollar
packages taken home by executives at the top of the Verizon pyramid,
has shaken his faith in a system he believed in.

Why American Teens Don't Want the New Cell Phones.

By Brendan I. Koerner

The past year was a thoroughly rotten one for America's wireless
industry, stung by price wars and tumbling demand. Pretty much
everyone who wants a cell phone already has one, and they're none too
eager to buy new $300-$400 handsets simply for the luxury of a sleeker
faceplate or a tidier address book. The only way for the mobile market
to grow is to get users psyched about data services, such as
downloading games, transmitting pictures, or the Short Messaging
Service, the wireless equivalent of instant messaging.  Which is why
T-Mobile hired Catherine Zeta-Jones to hawk its next-generation phones
and why Verizon's running those Euro-cool "Hello, Moto!" commercials
that trumpet cell phones as go-anywhere gaming machines.

Subject: U.S. TV Shows Losing Potency Around World


By SUZANNE KAPNER

LONDON - Want to catch the latest episode of the CBS hit "C.S.I." in 
France? Tune in Saturdays at 11 p.m. How about the CBS show "Judging 
Amy" in Singapore? Try weekdays at midnight.

Those programs would have been candidates for prime time several 
years ago. But today American dramas and sitcoms -- though some 
remain popular -- increasingly occupy fringe time slots on foreign 
networks, industry executives say. Instead, a growing number of shows 
produced by local broadcasters are on the air at the best times.

"Whereas American TV shows used to occupy prime-time slots, they are
now more typically on cable, or airing in late-night or weekend
slots," said Michael Grindon, president of Sony Pictures Television
International.

The shift counters a longstanding assumption that TV shows produced in
the United States would continue to overshadow locally produced shows
from Singapore to Sicily. The changes are coming at a time when the
influence of the United States on international affairs has chafed
friends and foes alike, and some people are expressing relief that at
least on television American culture is no longer quite the force it
once was.

Subject: Professors Vie With Web for Class's Attention


By JOHN SCHWARTZ

Universities are rushing toward a wireless future, installing networks
that let students and the faculty surf the Internet from laptop
computers in the classroom, in the library or by those ponds that
always seem to show up on the cover of the campus brochure.

But professors say the technology poses a growing challenge for them:
retaining their students' attention.

In a classroom at American University in Washington on a recent 
afternoon, the benefits and drawbacks of the new wireless world were 
on display. From the back row of an amphitheater classroom, more than 
a dozen laptop screens were visible. As Prof. Jay Mallek lectured 
graduate students on the finer points of creating and reading an 
office budget, many students went online to Blackboard.com, a Web 
site that stores course materials, and grabbed the day's handouts 
from the ether.

But just as many students were off surfing. A young man looked at 
sports photos while a woman checked out baby photos that just arrived 
in her e-mailbox.

The screens provide a silent commentary on the teacher's
attention-grabbing skills. The moment he loses the thread, or fumbles
with his own laptop to use its calculator, screens flip from classroom
business to leisure. Students dash off e-mail notes and send instant
messages. A young man who is chewing gum shows an amusing e-mail
message to the woman next to him, and then switches over to read the
online edition of The Wall Street Journal.

Subject: Pact Lifts an Obstacle to HDTV Transition


By ERIC A. TAUB

THE switch from analog to digital high-definition television has been 
slow and bumpy. But representatives of the consumer electronics and 
cable television industries predict that a new set of rules 
negotiated last month will accelerate the transition.

Soon purchasers of new high-definition, or HD, TV sets will be able 
to receive programming through their cable systems as easily as they 
now can with an analog set, by plugging a standard cable into the 
back of the television. Today most HDTV sets require a separate 
set-top box to receive digital cable programming, and the 
transmission standards differ from cable system to cable system.

Under an agreement between representatives of the Consumer 
Electronics Association and the National Cable and Telecommunications 
Association, new cable-ready HDTV's to be introduced in the next few 
years will be plug-and-play; they will no longer need a separate box 
to receive digital broadcasts, HDTV versions of pay services or any 
other available basic cable or pay-TV programming.

Up to now there has been no industry standard for how the cable 
companies transmit high-definition programming, so an HDTV-capable 
set-top box designed for one system may not work with another. The 
consumer electronics industry has long argued that consumers have 
delayed buying digital televisions because they did not know how to 
connect them to their cable services, did not know if they could 
record HDTV programs, did not want to use a separate converter box, 
or feared that the sets would become obsolete.

So, you figure because no one likes TPC that it is okay to accept "free"
services, such as Caller ID in this case, that are tariffed for sale?

Sounds like two-wrongs-make-a-right syndrome.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I can assure you that if it had been
the other way around -- where TPC owed me money, and that did happen
just two months ago -- TPC would have had no concern about refunding
it to me. They would have -- and in fact did -- let it go until I just
happened to review my account on line one day and saw where I had a 
new 'credit balance-do not pay' situation. Then I discovered that on
October 6 they had made the usual deduction from my bank account (I 
pay by autodraft) then again on October 26 took it out a second time. 
When *I* called to complain about it, they first tried to tell me they
would just use it for the next month's bill. When I made my usual
(almost monthly, it seems) call to the Commission offices in Topeka,
I got a call the next day from the usual flunky in the chairman's
office who said she would refund it. I didn't hold my breath waiting,
but about two weeks later I got the refund. Listen Joe, I am getting
to be *so tired* of being a service rep for my own account with those
people. If I have to audit my account on line a couple times per month
to see the lastest stunt they have pulled, then they can do the same 
for me. PAT]

Subject: Caller ID Problems
Date: Thu, 02 Jan 2003 09:08:08 -0600
Organization: http://extra.newsguy.com


Does anyone have any suggestions on resolving a problem I have been
having with Caller ID for the past 13 months?

Here's is what is happening: When I receive some *Local* calls,
generally either from a business or a county/municipal office, I only
recieve the last 4 digits of the number.  Instead of seeing
319-334-1234 I will only get 1234 on the display.  Any display, even a
brand new one plugged in all by itself, nothing else on the line.
Name appears as Unavailable.

Residential callers in the same exchange will appear correctly with
their name displayed, as do long distance and cellular calls (without
the name of course on cellular calls).  

This all started one magical day when I was switched from Qwest to
McLeod USA local service service.  Of course, McCleod being the CLEC
blamed Qwest (it is their switch after all) and Qwest of course blamed
McLeod saying they probably have a bad switch configuration, as if
McLeod had their own switch here (they don't).

I switched back to Qwest a month later to hopefully resolve that
problem, and the problem of not having any long distance service due
to McLeod/Qwest totally screwing up my line so that an invalid PIC was
selected.  That fixed nothing.  Eventually Qwest addmitted the long
distance thing was human error on their part and trasnferred me to
someone in the switch engineering group who fixed it.

Still, over a year later, they cannot seem to find a problem with the
caller id and blame McLeod USA, who is most likely the carrier of all
the callers showing up incorrectly.

Dozens of trouble tickets later, nothing has been found, each trouble
ticket results in a tech making a call from the CO and saying "look ,
it works" and closing the ticket out.

Anything suggestions to get this fixed would be appreciated.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Try not paying them for a couple months
until *they* get around to calling you to ask for it. Then when they
do, tell them you want the Caller ID fixed once and for all.   PAT]

Actually, I kind of like it. I used to miss the anemic Call-Waiting tone 
constantly. Ever since the passing of the 1A-ESS switches, the tone can 
be easily missed if one is not paying attention ... or talking. When the 
CID bursts started appearing with the CW tone, it could no longer be 
ignored.

Subject: WorldCom Ups Rates For Consumers, Not Businesses


By Jessica Hall

    PHILADELPHIA, Jan 3 (Reuters) - Bankrupt telephone and data
services company WorldCom Inc. <WCOEQ.PK> <MCWEQ.PK> has hiked
long-distance calling rates for residential customers, but
corporate customers still can bargain for sweet deals on
large-scale voice and data contracts, analysts said on Friday.

    WorldCom has raised consumer long-distance fees four times
since it filed for bankruptcy in July, marking a reversal of
the ferocious price wars of the late 1990s that drove calling
rates down to pennies-a-minute.

    But prices in the corporate market remain flat-to-slightly
lower as WorldCom scrambles to retain its lucrative clients and
rivals swoop in to nab customers skittish over WorldCom's
bankruptcy and $9 billion accounting scandal.

Subject: Over 140,000 Join List to Block Telemarketers


By Bruce Mohl, Globe Staff, 1/3/2003

More than 140,000 people signed up for the state's do-not-call list in
its first two days of official operation, indicating that
Massachusetts consumers have a strong interest in curtailing the flow
of telemarketing calls coming into their homes.

Anne L. Collins, deputy director of the state's office of consumer
affairs, said about 20,000 Massachusetts residents signed up in the
days leading up to the official opening of the list on New Year's
Day. On Wednesday and yesterday, she said, another 140,000 signed up.

Subject: Signup Begun to Ward Off Telemarketers


By Associated Press, 1/1/2003

Massachusetts has launched its 'Do Not Call' registry, which allows 
residents to block telemarketing calls to their homes, and state 
officials are expecting a huge response.

The registry was set up quietly over the weekend, ahead of the 
announced Jan. 1 start date, and officials said more than 10,000 
people have already signed up.

Massachusetts has about 3 million residential phone lines, and state 
officials are predicting about a million of those consumers will sign 
up within the first month.

Subject: Government Openness at Issue as Bush Holds On to Records


By ADAM CLYMER

WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 - The Bush administration has put a much tighter
lid than recent presidents on government proceedings and the public
release of information, exhibiting a penchant for secrecy that has
been striking to historians, legal experts and lawmakers of both
parties.

Some of the Bush policies, like closing previously public court
proceedings, were prompted by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and are
part of the administration's drive for greater domestic security.
Others, like Vice President Dick Cheney's battle to keep records of
his energy task force secret, reflect an administration that arrived
in Washington determined to strengthen the authority of the executive
branch, senior administration officials say.

Some of the changes have sparked a passionate public debate and
excited political controversy. But other measures taken by the Bush
administration to enforce greater government secrecy have received
relatively little attention, masking the proportions of what dozens of
experts described in recent interviews as a sea change in government
openness.

A telling example came in late 2001 when Attorney General John 
Ashcroft announced the new policy on the Freedom of Information Act, 
a move that attracted relatively little public attention.

Although the new policy for dealing with the 1966 statute that has 
opened millions of pages of government records to scholars, reporters 
and the public was announced after Sept. 11, it had been planned well 
before the attacks.

The Ashcroft directive encouraged federal agencies to reject requests 
for documents if there was any legal basis to do so, promising that 
the Justice Department would defend them in court. It was a stark 
reversal of the policy set eight years earlier, when the Clinton 
administration told agencies to make records available whenever they 
could, even if the law provided a reason not to, so long as there was 
no "foreseeable harm" from the release.

Subject: Student Charged in DirecTV Theft


By JENNIFER 8. LEE

WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 - A 19-year-old University of Chicago student was
arrested in Los Angeles today and charged with stealing trade secrets
from DirecTV, the nation's leading satellite television provider.

Federal prosecutors said that Igor Serebryany of Los Angeles would be 
charged under the rarely used 1996 Economic Espionage Act with 
stealing the documents -- which described the latest technology to 
control access to DirecTV -- and releasing them on the Internet. He 
faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Prosecutors said Mr. Serebryany, a sophomore at the University of 
Chicago, stole confidential papers about DirecTV's latest generation 
of satellite television smart cards from the law firm of Jones, Day, 
Reavis & Pogue. Mr. Serebryany, who worked for an outside document 
preparation company, was imaging papers for a civil lawsuit over 
DirecTV's card technology.

Jones Day represents DirecTV in a lawsuit against NDS, the company 
that designs encrypted satellite cards for DirecTV. According to 
prosecutors, Mr. Serebryany sent hundreds of digital documents to 
three satellite pirate Web sites in September and October.

The confidential documents contained technical specifications for 
DirecTV's Period 4 generation of satellite smart cards, as well as 
correspondence between NDS and DirecTV discussing the card's 
architecture and design, according to DirectTV. The technical details 
about the card are valuable because the three previous generations of 
DirecTV access cards have already been hacked by pirates.

Subject: Companies in U.S. Sing Blues as Europe Reprises 50's Hits


By ANTHONY TOMMASINI

European copyright protection is expiring on a collector's trove of
1950's jazz, opera and early rock 'n' roll albums, forcing major
American record companies to consider deals with bootleg labels and
demand new customs barriers.

Already reeling from a stagnant economy and the illegal but widespread
downloading of copyrighted music from the Internet, the recording
companies will now face a perfectly legal influx of European
recordings of popular works.

Copyright protection lasts only 50 years in European Union countries,
compared with 95 years in the United States, even if the recordings
were originally made and released in America. So recordings made in
the early- to mid-1950's - by figures like Maria Callas, Elvis Presley
and Ella Fitzgerald - are entering the public domain in Europe,
opening the way for any European recording company to release albums
that had been owned exclusively by particular labels.

Although the distribution of such albums would be limited to Europe in
theory, record-store chains and specialty outlets in the United States
routinely stock foreign imports.

Expiring copyrights could mean much cheaper recordings for music
lovers, but they do not bode well for major record companies. (These
copyrights apply to only the recordings, not the music recorded.) The
expected crush of material entering the public domain has already sent
one giant company, EMI Classics, into a shotgun marriage with a
renegade label that it had long tried to shut down to protect its
lucrative Callas discography. The influx also has the American record
industry talking about erecting a customs barrier.

DISCLAIMER: I do not speak for Mitel, nor for any Mitel dealer, nor have I
ever received any formal Mitel training.

After a respectable amount of downtime-free (thanks to a decent UPS
and lots of spare batteries) running time, a couple of the lines
between our SX-2000 and our Mitel Mail system started acting
unreliably.  Our dealer's technician told us to reboot it.  When
prompted for advice on how, he said just shut it off and on again.

So, long after business hours, we basically simulated a power failure
by switching off the UPS rather than flip individual switches (we have
several cabinets.)

Everything came back fine.

Of course, that's no guarantee that you'll be blessed by the same fate!

Misconfigurations of the originating PBX can cause this. Your former 
telco apparently was "filling in" the missing data, such as area code 
and prefix and your new telco does not. 

Not sure who's responsibility this might be, but the root cause of the 
problem is associated with the callers' equipment, not your telco or 
your CID terminal equipment.

I'll bet that they ultimately discover the problem in the originating 
PBXes.

It could be that the calls are coming from a PBX via ISDN-PRI trunks,
and the originating telco expects the CPID from the PBX, which doesn't
deliver complete information. Some telcos overlook the CPID from the
PBX and send the BTN (billing telephone number) of the subscriber site
as CPID for all calls. Perhaps while you were switching telcos, some
CPID and/or trunking changes were being made at the offices you're now
seeing four digits only from.

I've dealt with a Nortel Meridian system that defaults to delivering
the extension number (last four digits) only. To get it to send
accurate, complete CPID requires some major reprogramming. Some other
PBXs may behave like the Nortel in this regard.

The agencies and businesses that you're seeing four digits and no name
from may not be aware of what's being sent with their calls. Chances
are, if they're not aware of it, there will be no way to explain it to
them, either.

The problem he's experiencing is because the PBX's used by those 
business and government agencies are probably fed via PRI and their 
switches (More likely than not AT&T/Lucent/Avaya G3i) lets the agency 
set the outbound caller-ID information.

It's the telco's job to provision the line properly.  If they turn on
something extra by mistake, it's not my obligation to tell them.  In a
situation like this the customer is blameless (unlike, for example,
one where a cable TV customer climbs the pole to remove a trap in
order to get HBO for free).

This is exactly why I let NOBODY autodraft my account.  I get the
paper bill, its due date is (say) Jan 16.  It goes on a stack on my
desk, and whenever a few have accumulated I log on to electronic bill
pay from my bank and pay them.  In most cases I will set the pay-on
date to the day before the due date, Jan 15 in this example.

Haven't had a problem with it yet, takes about the same time & effort
as writing a check and mailing it, and costs $0.00 instead of $0.37.

> (I pay by autodraft)

That is a dangerous practice to permit TPC unfettered access to your
bank account.  Just imagine one of those erroneous long distance or
"enhanced" services hitting your bill, then the TPC wipes out your
bank account.  Now, you get to argue with them while they have your
money and your outstanding checks all bounce.

A lot of folks don't realize how volitile electronic debit
authorizations can be, unlike credit card charges where they don't get
your money until you decide to let them have it.  Electronic debits
should be limited to recurring charges that are fixed in amount, such
as a mortgage or car payment.

"Let the buyer beware" is really on-target with electronic debit
authorizations.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Although the problems you discuss are
very real, I still find it easier for me to use autodraft for my
regular, recurring bills, such as gas and electric. Both of those
bills are fixed amounts (budget plan) so I know what they will be. The
cable bill is also a fixed amount and autodrafted. City of Independence
water/sewer/garbage pickup is also a fixed amount (with a small tolerance)
each month for a year at a time, so is also autodrafted. The only bill
which can be trouble is Southwestern Bell. But I have two things in my
favor there; or maybe three. I have numerous blocks on my line with my
okay:  no 900 calls, billed number screeing, and I make most of my
long distance calls on the cellphone or AOL-by-Phone (they are free in
most cases), but I still keep a one hundred minute package of time for
LD on my phone, which costs six dollars. So by and large, my phone and
DSL service are fixed at about $90 per month. I do not expect many
surprises there; aggravations from SWB, yes; surprises, no. Also, SWB
puts the new bill on line for review four weeks before they actually
debit it, and finally, I have a very friendly and understanding bank
manager. My bank statements are on line also. It is unimaginable to me
that anyone could make off with any money from my account, but I do
watch my balance and the various debits which go through rather closely.
When a bank only has seven or eight employees, period, and each of
them has a key to the front door, there is not a lot to worry about 
where the bank is concerned. I do understand your thoughts however,
and if I were still living in Chicago, IL or another large city where
no one cares about anything, I'd probably not do autodraft either.  PAT]

Of course it is. These jailcell phones are being installed in jails in 
my area that charge similar outrageous amounts. The local PD gets 40-50% 
of the take. What representative, councilperson, or mayor will argue 
with that? It's much more convenient as well because an officer or 
jailer doesn't have to take a prisoner out of the cell, to a phone, dial 
the number, etc. These phones are installed in the cells, so the 
prisoner can use the phone whenever they like. 

Convenience, reduced manpower requirements, and make a profit? Seems 
like a no-brainer to our ethically-challenged politicians.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Now, if they could only set more
reasonable and fair rates, it would be hard to quarrel with the idea.
But they won't. That's where ethics and challenges come into it. There
are a lot of very difficult problems in corrections, not the least of
which is corrections employees who have a vested interest in keeping
their jobs, and that assurance is best met by making sure the inmate
population continues to rise month after month, year after year.
Keeping inmates out of touch with their family and friends and the
rest of society is one way to insure the return rate will continue to
stay very high. What's wrong with your final sentence, Dave, is that
corrections is not supposed to be a profit making enterprise.   PAT]

Subject: RBOCs Charging Extra $10/Month For More Than One Host on DSL

Apparently, at least one of the RBOCs is charging an extra $10/month
to hook up multiple computers to the same DSL feed. Given that their
DSL modems have both DHCP and NAT, how could the RBOC's ISP tell that
you had more than one computer inside the modem's firewall? Even if it
could, what would keep you from having your "one computer connected to
the Internet" be a router/firewall?

$10/month sounds really steep for this, especially when routers with 4
switched ports cost around $60 to purchase.

Does anybody know the companies are thinking? If you know how to do
this yourself, do they really care?

John Levine pinpointed the problem. The specific phone I have (Samsung
SCH-3500) has three roaming options: "Sprint PCS" (no roaming),
"Analog" (roaming only, on the analog cellular network), or
"Automatic" (prefer PCS, but also roam on digital or analog
networks). I was using the "Analog" setting, under the mistaken
impression that it was equivalent to "Automatic" in areas with no PCS
service. I figured it would save me the time of first trying to get a
PCS signal before dropping over onto the roaming side. It turns out I
was shutting out digital roaming options. It is also possible that the
analog network wouldn't accept my call because I was on a digital
phone in an area with digital service.

I can't test the theory right at the moment, though, because putting
the phone in "Automatic" mode here just pops it into the PCS network.
I'll give it a try the next time I'm travelling outside PCS territory.

You know, over the past couple of years it's become obvious to me that
the white collar worker is the new blue collar worker--and it looks
like 1920 all over again.

I'm not a union man.  I generally think that in this day and age,
unions -- as they've made themselves today -- are not necessary.  In
fact, generally it seems as if the average (autoworker, electrician,
etc.)  needs protection against union management itself.

However, as I've watched big business do its thing over the past few
years, it seems to me that the unions are missing a HUGE opportunity
here to remake themselves.  The cube-dwellers are the modern
equivalent, in the modern techno-services industry, to the machine
operators and tradesmen of the older industrial society.  And they're
being treated exactly the same way.

The unions could HUGELY increase their membership and relevance to
society by organizing these people and protecting them against the
"fabulous, multimiillion-dollar executives" and the abuses of said
executives against the common working folk down there in cubeville.

And if they did their work right, the unions could simultaneously
remake themselves into protectors of the investor and his investments.
The executive abuses are simply power and money grabs by individuals
who are in a position to do so; by protecting the union members
against that and watching over these executives very carefully, the
unions could be whistleblowers that (a) could catch problems very
early on, and (b) be untouchable in their whistleblowing, unlike
individuals who simply don't have the money or time or energy to fight
it when they see it.  Union-backed whistleblowing which protects the
workers by definition protects the investors.

And if the unions spun that right, got a good marketing angle on it,
the unions could reinvent themselves for the new economy and come out
stronger than ever.

Now, I'm not pro-union.  I'm just wondering why somebody else hasn't
thought of this over the last three years and implemented it.  It
sounds awfully logical to me.

Subject: Re: Pact Lifts an Obstacle to HDTV Transition


It seems that the behind the scenes negotiating between the TV
industry (who wants to protect their investment in programming) and
the National Cable TV Association (NCTA), will speed up the
introduction of HDTV to meet the US Government's set time table for
introduction of HDTV and also seems to be an accelerator for the end
to analog transmission of TV signals.

When the Government made this schedule some years ago, I recall that
some discussions were made on this forum but at the time many thought
that this would never happen - but it seems that it will indeed happen
but did anyone figure then what all this change would cost the
individual consumer?

So with this agreement, the issue of the existing analog TV sets is
now set for extinction. Because when all that is available - over the
air AND now on cable - is HDTV digital signals, it will be mandatory
that we all will have to spend (collectively) $ millions (perhaps $
billions) to purchase HDTV sets (and other appliances) in order to
watch (and record) any kind of US TV programming.

You will note that the article indicates that there is even a newly
agreed to limitation on the recording of TV signals, as new connection
(or connectors) standards will preclude the usage of present day VCR's
or even recordable DVD's!. Another new device (with time limitations
built-in) will be required to record, for time delay, TV shows to fit
our schedules!.

Of course all of this is a great boon to the manufacturers of TV's and
recording devices. But also more scrap (existing analog TV's, VCR's,
etc.)  generation for dumps' and scrap collectors'!

You know, Orwell might have been right in his tome, "1984":
"Big-Brother" Government is really getting involved in how we live our
lives. Wonder what ever happened here in the US to free choice and
free will of the consumer?  We will have no choice but to buy this new
technology and throw away the old.

Subject: Rural WV and high speed internet


I've a piece of property in Pendleton County WV. Dial-up Internet
services are available, but I've wanted to get something faster. Since
I don't live in the county seat (Franklin), I don't have access to
cable TV.

So for high speed internet the choices are:

1) Satellite
2) DSL
3) ISDN
4) T1/T3

Satellite. I've followed the saga of satellite internet service for
sometime, and frankly I'm less than impressed with the choices. I've
basically decided, it isn't worth the gamble.

DSL. Unavailable in my section of WV. 

ISDN. Only available for "business", not "residential" as near as I
can tell from Verizon. Also they also will only hook up the ISDN line,
if you get your internet service from Verizon. Verizon's ISDN internet
is long distance from my place not to mention being considerably more
expensive than that alternatives.  A resistance check in the past
shows that the line to my house is sufficient for ISDN.

T1/T3. Available, but prohibitively expensive due to distance from
available circuits. Last time I checked, they charged by the distance
(in feet) to the CO. Unfortunately for me, distance to the CO is
measured in miles ...

Based on the number of people in the county (approx. 8,000), I don't
fore see any of this changing anytime in my lifetime.

So that leaves me with ISDN as my only choice in an affordable
sense. A couple of years ago, I called and ordered ISDN. Everything
was going smoothly up until the local junction box was examined. At
that point they realized they didn't have any free copper (for me
 ... OR for several voice circuits that had been ordered) and my order
was cancelled.

I understand that the junction box may have been rewired in the last
year, so I may pursue this again. The only glitch is having to deal
with Verizon for the internet service. I'd rather just get the ISDN
line and then connect to the ISP of my choice (several of which are
actually local). Any ideas on how I should pursue this?

Subject: A Nasty Surprise for Car Thieves


By Randy Dotinga

Armed with satellite tracking technology and remote-control devices, 
police officers from Virginia to Southern California are arresting 
car thieves who have unwittingly stolen booby-trapped Camrys and 
Accords.

When a thief drives off with a "bait car" that's been left parked 
somewhere, police track its location, dispatch officers and use 
remote control to stop the vehicle in its tracks.

While some police departments don't publicize their use of the cars, 
police in San Diego and Arlington, Virginia, recently acknowledged 
putting them on the street. Police in Memphis, Tennessee; Winnipeg, 
Manitoba; Sacramento, California; and at least 100 other cities also 
use the cars, which can be outfitted for between $600 and $3,200, 
plus monthly fees and startup costs.

Unlike LoJack, which relies on homing devices to find stolen cars, 
the tracking systems use GPS software and transmit data through one 
or more communications networks.

While satellite-tracked bait cars have been around for five years, 
they now come with added technology tricks, all hidden from the eyes 
of car thieves until it's too late. Perhaps the most important device 
is a kill switch that allows police to stop the car by remote 
control, either by slowly cutting off the gas or suddenly switching 
off the engine.

Subject: Is This the Face of a Terrorist?


By Julia Scheeres

FBI investigators have traveled to Pakistan to determine whether a 
man claiming he was mistakenly included in the agency's wanted list 
is telling the truth about his identity.

But face-recognition experts said Friday they were able to back up 
the man's claim in a matter of minutes by comparing his FBI mug shot 
with photographs taken by the news media.

The confusion started earlier this week, when the FBI released the 
photos, names and birth dates of five Arab men who are allegedly 
residing in the United States after slipping over the Canadian border.

The FBI charged that the men used fake passports obtained through an 
ID and smuggling ring that has known terrorist connections.

Subject: Spying on Snookums With GPS


By Randy Dotinga

In a rambling building that overlooks a freeway in San Diego, a bank 
of computers monitors the travels of trucks carrying hazardous 
materials, making sure they don't go anywhere near such landmarks as 
the White House and the capitol building of Arkansas.

Using GPS software, the computers also track cars for seven police 
agencies. Some of the vehicles are waiting to be stolen, while others 
are driven by unsuspecting suspects who are under surveillance.

And then there are the private citizens, some 5,000 of them, whose 
cars are tracked night and day. Finding their latitude and longitude 
is as easy as logging on to the Internet, typing in a password and 
looking at a computerized map. It's impossible, however, to find out 
how many of the customers track their spouses or partners without 
telling them.

LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles city councilman has called for an

Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine plans to introduce a motion

WASHINGTON -- Millions of travelers arriving and departing the United 
States will have to submit detailed personal information this year 
under rules proposed by the federal government Friday as part of the 
war on terrorism.

The rules proposed by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, 
once they are finalized, seek more information from travelers than 
under current law and for the first time extend the requirements to 
U.S. citizens and others previously exempted.

All airlines, cargo flights, cruise ships and other vessels carrying 
crew or passengers will be affected, with the exception of 
ferryboats. The information will be sent electronically to the 
government before a traveler arrives in the United States or departs 
from it, giving officials a complete manifest of exactly who is on

By Associated Press

SEATTLE -- If a judge's order takes effect forcing Microsoft to 
include Sun Microsystems' Java software in the Windows operating 
system, neither the companies nor PC users will see much immediate 
impact.

Microsoft will still be the overwhelmingly dominant maker of desktop 
PC software. Sun's core business of selling servers will remain 
tough. And consumers will wonder what the fuss was all about.

Over time, observers say, the biggest consequence could be the
precedent of a judge -- and not engineers, software companies or even
users -- deciding what is installed on personal computers.

Subject: Why RIAA Keeps Getting Hacked


By Michelle Delio
02:00 AM Jan. 03, 2003 PT

The Recording Industry Association of America may not want people to 
share digital files, but the organization certainly seems to be in 
favor of open access to its website.

On Monday, the RIAA site was hacked for the sixth time in six months.

This time, the defacement resulted in bogus press releases on the 
front door, touting the joys of cheese and interspecies romantic 
relationships.

The RIAA's role as the music industry's voice against digital piracy 
makes it an obvious target for those who are angered by what they see 
as the organization's overly vehement crusade for copyright owners' 
rights.

Since the RIAA site is such a tempting target, many wonder why the 
organization hasn't made more of an effort to secure its site. On 
Monday, access to the site's supposedly private innards was gained in 
much the same way as it was last August.

Some security experts said in no uncertain terms that the latest 
defacements indicate the RIAA is clueless about technology. They 
charge that this ignorance has resulted in the RIAA attempting to 
combat digital file sharing in ineffective, counter-productive ways.

Subject: Testing the Wireless Waters With WiFi


Firm Sees Coasts As Internet Frontiers

By Yuki Noguchi
Washington Post Staff Writer
Friday, January 3, 2003; Page E01

The typical domains of wireless networks are college campuses, major
airports, high-end hotels, trendy coffee shops and tech-heavy
neighborhoods. But Forrest C. "Woody" Wheat sees a new horizon for
this increasingly popular technology: the near-shore waters of the
American coast.

Wheat, whose Reston-based firm has been selling high-speed wireless
service for three months after a year of building a network, said he
hopes to expand it for boaters using "every little estuary" along the
U.S. coast. Wheat sees maritime service as his way to carve a niche in
the market for the technology known as WiFi, a system that makes
high-speed Internet connections from a laptop as portable as a call
from a cell phone. He is among an expanding fleet of competitors
looking to capitalize on the technology.

Those who sell WiFi service still face technical and financial
challenges, and few firms have managed to profit from selling the
service. But analysts and market watchers expect consumers to embrace
the technology in greater numbers, even as the rest of the
telecommunications industry struggles to stay afloat.

Subject: Police Dragnets for DNA Tests Draw Criticism


By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

BATON ROUGE, La., Jan. 3 - Recently, the police asked Shannon F. 
Kohler if they could swab the inside of his mouth to analyze his DNA. 
It was a request they made of 800 men in southern Louisiana as they 
searched for the serial killer who has slain four young women, 
leaving behind genetic material in each case.

It was his choice, Mr. Kohler said the officers told him, but if he 
refused, they would get a court order and that would get in the 
newspapers and then everyone would know he was not cooperating. The 
approach was heavy-handed and foolish, he said, especially since he 
has feet much bigger than the prints left by the killer and had phone 
bills that show he was at home when the murders took place.

The questions Mr. Kohler is raising about DNA testing are also being 
asked by lawyers and other experts around the country who say the 
growing use of DNA dragnets like the one here, already one of the 
largest in American history, is troubling.

The tests, supposedly voluntary, can still be coercive, critics say,
not only harassing innocent people but also potentially violating
suspects' constitutional protections against compelled
self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure. Future
prosecutions could be undermined, some legal scholars, defense lawyers
and even some prosecutors say. Some question whether the dragnets'
limited success justifies the effort and expense. And even those who
endorse the idea of DNA sweeps argue over whether -- and why -- the
government should keep on file the genetic profiles of those who are
proved to be innocent.

The tests trouble some for the very reason that police find them 
attractive: they offer the most incontrovertible proof of identity.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Hey. Mr. Kohler ... welcome to RealWorld.
Police do *not* like it when a citizen thwarts them in their often

Subject: U.S. to Make Airlines Give Data on Americans Going Overseas


By DAVID JOHNSTON

WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 - Americans traveling abroad would have to give 
the government detailed personal information before leaving or 
returning under an antiterrorism rule that the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service proposed today.

The rule would force airlines and shipping companies to collect and 
submit to the government the name, birth date, sex, passport number, 
home country and address of every passenger and crew member. The 
intent is to provide the authorities with more complete information 
about who enters and leaves the United States.

Currently, air and shipping lines are not required to provide such 
information to the government about Americans. The proposed rule 
would make it mandatory for carriers to supply the information about 
American citizens and noncitizens, immigration officials said.

Much of the information is already collected from people entering the 
country in an arrangement in which 80 percent of commercial carriers 
voluntarily give personal information about their passengers to the 
immigration service, the officials said. The added information would 
be collected while the aircraft or vessel was en route to the United 
States and electronically transmitted to immigration officials on the 
ground at the port of entry.

The rule would also require carriers to provide information about 
people who are leaving the United States within 48 hours after the 
departure of their flight or vessel, the officials said.

Subject: For the Gadget Universe, a Common Tongue


By BARNABY J. FEDER

IT is too soon to describe the Bose family as an audio-world version
of the Bush and Kennedy clans in politics, but they are off to a good
start.

In 1964, Amar Bose, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor 
and inventor, created the renowned high-fidelity sound systems 
company that bears the family name. Now, his only son, Vanu, is 
gaining recognition for radio-design technology every bit as novel as 
the sound systems that his father pioneered.

The younger Bose's four-year old company, Vanu Inc., is a prominent 
innovator in the effort to use software rather than hardware to 
control how radios, cellphones and all other wireless communications 
devices recognize and manage signals. Early versions of the 
technology, known as software-defined radio, are beginning to be 
deployed in military communications equipment and cellular base 
stations.

The goal is to develop software and related components that recognize 
various wave forms at any frequency in the radio spectrum and choose 
the appropriate applications to process them. A single device could 
provide cellphone service no matter what the format or frequency, 
exchange wireless messages with laptop or hand-held computers, and 
communicate with walkie-talkies or emergency services.

There is another potential benefit: being able to incorporate 
improved data speeds and features simply by downloading software, 
rather than replacing the customer's hardware or the company's 
network equipment.

Blogs, personal Web sites featuring everything from diaries to
artwork, are bubbling up from the underground. Even America Online
reportedly may be jumping on the blog bandwagon. Sites including
Blogger.com and UserLand Software already do this, but it's no secret
that AOL is looking for ways to boost revenue. Why not latch onto this
popular trend as more people and organizations use Web logs to run
their own personal Internet soapbox?

"What blogging has brought back to the Web is that initial beauty of 
connecting to other sources of information," Tiffany Shlain, director 
of the Webby Awards and an Internet trend watcher, told The Globe and 
Mail of Toronto. There are some 500,000 blogs estimated to be online, 
according to the article.

The subject of blogs sparked a lot of interest with Filter readers. 
As proof that blogs are going mainstream, and some would argue are 
mainstream already, Filter readers submitted scores of suggestions 
for their favorite blogs. While by no means comprehensive of the

Subject: FCC Preparing to Overhaul Telecom, Media Rules


If All Proposals Are Enacted, Major Firms in Field Will Be Less 
Regulated and More Free to Expand

By Jonathan Krim
Washington Post Staff Writer

Over the next few months, a single federal agency will begin to 
fundamentally alter the nation's communications and mass-media 
landscape, rewriting a broad swath of rules that affect the choices 
consumers have for getting online and the variety of television and 
radio programming they watch and hear.

If all of the changes being reviewed by the Federal Communications 
Commission are enacted as proposed, major telecommunications and 
media corporations will be less regulated, and more free to grow, 
than at any time in decades.

The rules in question govern how much telephone companies need to 
open their lines to competitors for local phone and high-speed 
Internet service, set restrictions on how many TV and radio stations 
can be owned by one company, and determine whether a company can own 
both newspapers and TV stations that serve the same community.

FCC officials say they expect to begin making decisions as early as 
February, after more than a year of intense debate and lobbying over 
sharply different visions of the best way to spur growth and 
competition in the country's information economy.

Opponents of the proposed rules fear that, taken together, they 
ultimately could lead to a few powerful conglomerates controlling the 
flow of electronic information, from programming of television and 
radio news and entertainment to owning the pipes that connect people 
to the Internet.

Those pushing for the changes argue that the old rules fail to 
account for emerging technologies that can provide a wealth of 
diverse information and means of communication. Burdensome regulation 
has stunted their deployment -- particularly of high-speed Internet 
access -- these people say, and this in turn has hampered recovery of 
the battered technology sector.

Subject: Cooling on the Cold Calling?/Some Telemarketers Changing Strategy


By Caroline E. Mayer
Washington Post Staff Writer

When telemarketers used to interrupt his dinner hour, Douglas E.
Palley often liked to cut the call short by saying, "I'm sorry, Mr.
Palley died." He did so even though he was -- and is -- a
telemarketer, president of a local company with 2,000 employees who
handle about 20 million calls a year.

Now Palley has decided his company will no longer make the
unsolicited sales calls that irritated him. CyberRep, the Tysons
Corner firm he built with partner S. Tien Wong, terminated its last
"cold-calling" contract with a long-distance company in August.

"It is our belief that the world of outbound telemarketing has a
terminal sickness and is dying," Palley said in a recent interview,
days after the Federal Trade Commission announced plans for a
national do-not-call list to allow consumers to register to block
unwanted telemarketing calls.

With 104 million calls made a day -- nearly six times the number made
10 years ago -- "it's the industry people love to hate," Palley said,
noting that 27 states have already created do-not-call lists. So his
company will concentrate on its "inbound" call centers, taking calls
from customers inquiring about their accounts, ordering products or
seeking technical help -- and hoping to use those calls as a sales
opportunity.

The number of cable TV subscriptions will be lower in 2002 than the

A worsening economic climate and lower consumer spending contributed

PRIVACY MATTERS
By Jane Black

Will Your TV Become a Spy?

Hollywood wants every new digital set to include technology that 
would stop people from putting its shows on the Net. Bad idea.

While the economy and stock markets struggled, 2002 was a golden year
for the silver screen. Thanks to blockbuster hits such as Spider-Man,
Harry Potter, and Lord of the Rings, ticket sales hit $9.3 billion
worldwide, a remarkable 13% rise over 2001's then-record receipts. So
much for claims that piracy threatens Hollywood's livelihood.

Yet studio execs remain on the warpath. As movies are increasingly
broadcast and sold in digital format, Tinseltown execs are panicked
that consumers will make infinite numbers of perfect digital copies
and share them over the Internet.

The U.S. Supreme Court has bowed out of a long-running dispute over a 
DVD descrambling utility, dealing a preliminary defeat to Hollywood 
studios and electronics makers.

Justice Sandra Day O'Connor placed a ruling by the California Supreme 
Court on hold last week, but rescinded her emergency stay on Friday.

O'Connor's decision came in response to court papers filed by lawyers 
for the defendant, Matthew Pavlovich, late Thursday. The effect is 
that Pavlovich is no longer barred from distributing the DeCSS 
descrambling utility by a court order, but he could be sued again if 
he decides to do so.

Subject: FBI Wants to Take Away Your Right to Encrypt Your Email and Data


This was taken from a FBI web site that answers 99 questions about the
FBI.
 
The FBI's position is that you should not be allowed to encrypt stuff
unless you allow the FBI to have the key to decrypt it.
 
Which is kinda like saying you should not be allowed to put a door
lock on your home unless you first give the FBI a key to the home so
they can search it if they think you're a criminal.
 
http://www.fbi.gov/aboutus/faqs/faqsone.htm 

What concerns do the FBI and the law enforcement community have
regarding the growing use of encryption products by the public, both
domestically and abroad? Law enforcement is extremely concerned about
the serious threat posed by the use of robust encryption products that
do not allow for authorized access or the timely decryption of
critical evidence obtained through lawful electronic surveillance and
search and seizure.
 
On one hand, encryption is extremely beneficial when used legitimately
to protect commercially sensitive information and communications. On
the other hand, the potential use of such products by criminals or
terrorists raises a tremendous threat to public safety and national
security.
 
In view of this, law enforcement supports a balanced encryption policy
which meets both commercial and individual needs as well as law
enforcement needs.  The FBI has found that robust encryption, combined
with a key escrow feature which permits court-authorized access to
"plain text," is the only way to achieve these two goals without
seriously jeopardizing public safety.

Subject: New Mass Telemarketing Law


There's a new law which is in effect in Massachusetts as of 1 Jan.
MGL Chapter 159C implements a state do not call list which telemarketers
(no matter where they are located) must observe, published quarterly
(with web-based and touch-tone signup for consumers).  While the first
list isn't to be published until 1 April, the other provisions of the
law which apply to all calls irrespective of the do not call list are
in effect from 1 Jan.

They are: (1) no faxes, (2) no pre-recorded calls, (3) no calls with
blocked caller-id or using a service which deliberately blocks caller
ID (which I think means that telemarketers need to get their LD
providers to send caller ID, such as a main number, on T-1 lines, etc.)
(4) all calls must provide within the first minute a disclosure that the
call is to make a sale or solicit funds, the full and correct name of
the telemarketing firm and the seller of the goods or services, and a
complete description of the goods being offered and their retail price.

Not sure how any telemarketer can do ALL of (4) in one minute!

Two calls within any 12-month period in violation of anything in the
chapter allow suit for $5,000 civil damages.  (Note that for the
pre-recorded calls, Federal law 47 USC 227 permits a $500-$1500 civil
suit in state court in response to the first pre-recorded call.)

Unfortunately, there is a major loophole in the definition of an
"Unsolicited telephonic sales call" in the Mass Do Not Call law:

It specifically exempts calls:

  in which the sale of goods and services is not completed, and payment
  or authorization of payment is not required, until after a face-to-face
  sales presentation by the telephone solicitor or a meeting between the
  telephone solicitor and customer.

In other words, they can still try to sell you aluminum siding, since the
call is to set up an appointment for a salesman to visit you.

And they can continue to call you and invite you to presentations to
sell timesharing (as long as you don't have to book a room and pay for
it during the call).

And I fear that the way the definition of "unsolicited telephonic sales
call" is worded, the definition has basically eliminated the protection
in the Law for many faxes or prerecorded calls for the reasons just
listed.

See www.state.ma.gov for info on the new law.

/john

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  A similar law was put into effect here
in Kansas. People can sign up using a touch tone phone by calling an
800 number up in Topeka, the state capitol. You call, and a voice-
response system first asks you for your number, explains all the rules
about telemarketing, and asks you to press some digit if you wish to
be added at the phone number you entered. Then you are given a chance
to add additional numbers as desired under *your control*, by entering
them one at a time, listening to the same speech about the rules, and
likewise confirming them. They started taking calls to load the database
around December 1, it took effect January 1, but enforcement will
begin in a couple more months. PAT]

This doesn't give the "exchange name" of the CO.
For instance, for 510-638, I know that the exchange name is Oakland

ARLB003 Hams help out during OK telephone emergency

Hams responded with emergency communication when Broken Arrow, OK, a
town of 75,000, experienced a citywide telephone outage on December
23. A request went out for amateurs to assist with emergency effort at
the local Emergency Operations Center and three area hospitals.

Several hams from the Broken Arrow Amateur Radio Club responded to the
call, staffing positions at the Broken Arrow EOC and three hospital
emergency rooms.

The operation lasted about five hours, with messages between the EOCs
and hospitals being passed. Lines of communications were also opened
with the Oklahoma State Department of Civil Emergency Management in
Oklahoma City via the HF amateur station in the Broken Arrow EOC.

The trouble with the phone system was created by the loss of SS7
signaling, a digital protocol for call routing. Unable to route a call
out of the local exchange, Broken Arrow phone customers could not call
outside the city limits. As a result, the City of Broken Arrow
implemented its Telecommunications Failure Plan.

There's another issue which I've been quite quick to point out on more
than one occasion:  inmates often can't call people who have home (or
lawyers who have business) phone lines from CLECs, because most CLECs
refuse to handle billing from anyone other than themselves and
*perhaps* "selected" major IXCs.  Of course, most CLECs don't mention
that to potential customers, just like CLECs usually don't mention
that potential customers will lose any line-share DSL if they switch
away from the ILEC.  :(

IMO, the FCC should either require full disclosure of "no third party
billing" policies and their consequences, or require CLECs to handle
billing for inmate calls, if not ALL collect and third-number call
charges originating from legitimate carriers.

I disagree *to a point* -- in most cases special switches are used to
reduce fraud.  Still, that alone doesn't justify the *outrageous*
rates most carriers charge those that accept inmate calls ...

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: There are two other categories of inmate to
outside calls which will not complete. If a person has a collect call
block on their lines (what is known as 'Billed Number Screening') then
those calls will not go through. The prison phone systems all dip the
database to see if such calls are accepted or not. And if you have an
800 number just to avoid the expense of a collect call, they get you
on that also. Prison phone systems will *not* even accept (right at 
the prison switch they are terminated) calls to toll free numbers.  You'd
think those would be okay, but oh, no ... if prisoner's wife/mother
gets an 800 number so she can receive calls from the prisoner without
having to take a second job to get the money to pay the phone bill,
she is SOL. Look, the corrections industry does *not* like inmates 
making outside contact. Under Supreme Court rules they *have* to 
allow it, but they make it as difficult and expensive as they can.  PAT]

I don't know.  I guess in the "old days" they expected you to rent
extensions from them and pay for each phone.  Must be the same
thinking with computers.  

I'll bet they would charge you by the byte if they could ...

None of these that I'm aware of use a PBX, all POTS lines.  Here in
the small town Independence, IA very few business or offices are large
enough to actually need their own PBX.  One office I am familar with
that exhibits this problem has a Panasonic KSU (don't recall the model
number but I've installed a couple of these myself) but it simply
interfaces with up to 3 incoming POTS lines via analog ports and has
no provisions even available for digital CO lines.

     - Jan 4, 2003 07:59 PM (Reuters)

    LONDON, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Mobile phone giant Vodafone Group Plc
(ISEL:VOD) plans to sell its $20 billion stake in U.S. joint venture
Verizon Wireless so it can fund a bid for complete control of a rival
U.S. mobile operator, the Independent on Sunday said.

    The newspaper cited U.S. sources as saying Vodafone had shown an
interest in two mobile operators: Voicestream, which is part of
Deutsche Telekom <DTEGn.DE>, and AT&T Wireless Services Inc
(NYSE:AWE), whose largest shareholder is Japanese operator NTT DoCoMo
Inc (TOKYO:9437).

    Vodafone has an option to sell its 45 percent stake in Verizon
Wireless to the majority shareholder, Verizon Communications
(NYSE:VZ). The newspaper put a $20 billion value on the option, saying
the sale of the stake would provide the financing for any bid.

Subject: Studios Using Digital Armor to Fight Piracy


By AMY HARMON

Lying dormant in virtually every digital cable box in America is 
technology that can prevent viewers from recording certain programs 
to watch them later. Soon, several Hollywood studios are planning to 
tell cable operators to flip the switch.

People who have become accustomed to recording pay-per-view and 
video-on-demand shows will probably still be able to, the studios say 
- so long as they pay an extra fee.

The move is one of a range of new restrictions Hollywood is beginning 
to impose on digital movies, music and television. After years of 
battling online piracy in court, media executives are fighting 
technology with technology, locking up their products with the same 
types of digital tools that millions of people have used to get the 
products free over the Internet.

Hacking Away, Long Before There Were Hackers
By JOHN SCHWARTZ

THE curious thing about the new film "Catch Me if You Can" is how 
contemporary it seems. Curious because this tale of Frank W. Abagnale 
Jr. - in real life a teenage con artist who cashed millions in fake 
checks while impersonating an airline pilot, a doctor and a 
prosecutor - is set in the swinging 60's.

In those days few mortals had used a computer, and Internet wasn't 
even a word. But the young Frank Abagnale seems an eery prefiguration 
of a very modern character: the hacker.

Like them, he discovered a vast and arcane system held together with 
technology - in his case, the nation's network of banks. He worked 
tirelessly to understand its every facet, from the codes used by the 
Federal Reserve system, to the special paper and ink and machines 
used to make checks. And he exploited the system with a teenager's 
limitless energy - and limited morality.

Microsoft is set to release its first mainstream consumer software 
application protected by product activation, in what could be a first 
step toward expanding use of the antipiracy technology.

On Tuesday, Microsoft plans to officially launch Plus Digital Media 
Edition (DME), a $19.95 add-on pack for the Windows XP operating 
system. Microsoft has offered various versions of Plus since the 
release of Windows 95. But unlike earlier versions, Plus DME is 
protected by product activation, meaning that consumers will have to 
enter a 25-key code to install the software and then "activate" Plus 
DME over the Internet.

 URGENT COUNTER-BUSINESS PROPOSAL

 FROM:  MR. R. PORTER
 DEAR FRIEND,
 MAY ALLAH SHINE DOWN HIS BLESSINGS UPON YOU!
 I AM MR. REX PORTER, SON OF BIG BILL (THREE-FINGERS) PORTER OF
 DRY GULCH (AN OUTLAW COUNTY IN THE STATE OF TEXAS - USA).
 AT A RECENT PRAYER MEETING, I HAD A VISION IN WHICH I WAS LED
 TO CONTACT YOU IN RESPONSE TO YOUR FINE LETTER,  BELOW.
 DURING AN UPRISING ALONG THE BORDER BETWEEN TEXAS AND
 MEXICO,  MY FAMILY (MYSELF, BILLY BOB, MA, BIG BILL AND LUCY SUE)
 WAS RECENTLY FORCED TO CEDE OUR RANCH AND ESCAPE TO THE WILDS
 OF NEW MEXICO WHERE BIG BILL LATER PERISHED DURING A COMBINATION
 MUD-SLIDE AND CATTLE STAMPEDE.  HE ALMOST MADE IT TO THE TOP OF THE
 KNOLL WHEN HE SLIPPED IN THE MUD AND WAS TRAMPLED BY 400 TOP GRADE
 BULLS.  MY PAPPY WAS A FRUGAL MAN AND WAS ABLE TO SAVE CASH
 ESTIMATED TO BE IN THE TEN FIGURE RANGE.   HOWEVER, BECAUSE IT IS
 ILLEGAL
 TO TRANSPORT MORE THAN $10,000 CASH, WE LEFT ALMOST ALL OF IT IN ONE OF
 OUR TWENTYFOUR GOLD MINE SHAFTS WHEN WE ESCAPED TO NEW MEXICO. WE HAVE
 DRAWN
 UP A MAP SHOWING THE FOURTEEN HIDING PLACES.  HOWEVER, THE BUSH
 FAMILY NOW REFUSES TO LET US HAVE ENTRY BACK INTO THE STATE OF TEXAS.
 THEY HAVE SOLD OFF ALL THE CATTLE AND TURNED THE RANCH INTO A SUMMER
 HOME SO THAT GEORGE SR., GEORGE JR. AND JEB CAN HAVE THEIR DRINKING
 PARTIES AWAY FROM THE EYE OF THE NATIONAL PRESS.  THEY ALSO HUNT QUAIL
 AND KILLDEER ON THE WEEKENDS THERE.  I DID MAKE ONE SNEAK VISIT BACK
 TO OUR SPREAD LATE LAST FALL, ONLY TO FIND THAT GEORGE JR. HAD
 CONFISCATED

 LAND MINES FROM THE TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD AND SET THEM AROUND THE MINE
 SHAFTS.  I KNOW THAT NONE OF THAT FAMILY IS SMART ENOUGH TO LOCATE THE
 MONEY BUT THEY CAN KEEP US AWAY UNLESS WE GET A WRIT FROM A FEDERAL
 JUDGE (PERHAPS ONE OF THE TWO DEMOCRAT APPOINTEES). HOMELAND SECURITY
 LATER
 TRACKED US TO A SMALL TOWN IN NEW MEXICO BUT WE WERE ABLE TO ESCAPE
 AND RELOCATE IN COLORADO.  WE HAVE HIRED A FINE LAWYER WHO ASSURES US
 HE CAN ARRANGE FOR US TO SECURE SUCH A WRIT.  HOWEVER, THE LEGAL FEES
 WILL BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF $1MM AND WILL HAVE TO BE HANDLED BY A
 BANKING ARRANGEMENT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  (REMEMBER WHO IS IN
 OFFICE HERE)  WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU
 WILL ASSIST ME BY CONTACTING A BANK (PERHAPS IN SWITZERLAND) AND
 SECURING

 A LOAN FOR $1.5MM.  PLEASE FORWARD THAT TO ME VIA A CERTIFIED CASHIERS
 CHECK SO MY LAWYER CAN SECURE THE WRIT.  MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE
 THE HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS EFFORT DEMANDS, AND HOPE
 YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU.
 IN CONCLUSION, IN THE EVENT YOU ARE INTERESTED TO ASSIST ME, I WOULD
 LIKE
 YOU TO CONTACT ME.  FINALLY, I WILL SET ASIDE 20% OF THE TOTAL SUM FOR
 YOUR
 ASSISTANCE AND 10% FOR ANY EXPENSES THAT SHALL BE INCURRED DURING THIS
 TRANSACTION.  I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR CERTIFIED CASHIERS CHECK AS SOON
 AS POSSIBLE.  TELL BASHER I SAID "HEY" AND THAT I CONTINUE TO PRAY FOR

===========================================================

CREDITORS TO TAKE OVER MICROCELL: Microcell Telecom says its creditors
have approved a plan to swap their existing notes for 99.9% of the
company's shares and some new debt.  Microcell, which has filed for
bankruptcy protection during the transition, hopes to receive all
necessary approvals by the end of March. The company says it will
continue operating normally in the meantime.

** If approved, the plan will cut Microcell's debts from $2
    billion to $350 million, and reduce its annual interest
    payments by $200 million.

** Currently, Microcell's largest shareholders are Charles
    Sirois' Telesystem Ltd. (25%), T-Mobile (15%), and
    Quebec's Caisse de Depot (17%).

COURT APPROVES GT REORGANIZATION: The Ontario Superior Court has
approved Group Telecom's reorganization plan. GT expects to implement
the plan by February 15, clearing the way for its acquisition by
360networks. (See Telecom Update #363)

CRTC SAYS COMPETITION DID NOT ADVANCE IN 2001: The CRTC submitted its
report to Cabinet on the status of telecom competition and broadband
deployment on December 20.

** Industry-wide telecom service revenues grew by 10% in
    2001, to $32 billion: 79% of this was in wireline
    services, 21% in wireless.

** Wireline competitors' revenues increased from $2.6 billion
    in 1998 to $3.9 billion in 2001 (15% annual growth).
    However, competitors' EBITDA was "essentially nil" for the
    four years, while incumbents had nearly $10 billion in
    EBITDA each year.

** Competitors made little progress in local service. At the
    end of 2001 they served 591,000 business local lines and
    74,000 residential local lines (7.8% and .5% of each
    respective market). Competitors lost market share in long
    distance and in data/private-line services in the year.

** 85% of Canadians live in communities served by high-speed
    Internet access, mainly DSL and cable modem service. In
    2001, retail high-speed service revenues ($1.19 billion)
    exceeded dialup revenues for the first time.

CRTC CUTS CDNA RATES: The CRTC has significantly reduced the interim
rates for Competitor Digital Network Access service, reflecting cost
studies filed by the incumbent telcos in September. Call-Net had
argued that the previous rates included a 388% markup over cost,
instead of the 15% ordered by the Commission.

** Call-Net CEO Bill Linton says this ruling, which is
    retroactive to June 1, 2002, will bring Call-Net's cost
    savings to the level envisioned by the CRTC in its May
    2002 Price Cap decision.

CBC ACCUSES SATELLITE CARRIERS OF BIAS: A CBC submission to the CRTC
says that Bell ExpressVu carries nine CTV stations but only six CBC
English-language stations, and that Star Choice carries five TVA
stations but only two French-language CBC stations.

** The CBC says that a proposal by Bell ExpressVu to black
    out CBC network signals in favour of local stations in
    some markets would give further preferential treatment to
    CTV, which is owned by ExpressVu's parent company, BCE.

Actually, charging by the byte makes sense. After all, it is bandwidth 
that you are paying for. But charging based upon what you do with the 
data is nonsense. Whether the data is used by one or ten computers is 
irrelevant to them; it is only the quantity that counts.

And as anyone knows, seeing grainy, jerky images on a computer screen
with audio through a couple of three-inch speakers beats nearly
perfect images projected onto a 100' screen with audio through
THX-certified sound systems any day of the week.

I guess that movie execs are justified in thinking that suddenly the
movie theaters will be empty.

What happens if the PBX is part of a bigger private network and may
switch transit calls out on those trunks which won't have a CLID in
the local range?

I fully agree with the idea, but to implement it would be difficult, (at
least).

Possibly an "audiophile" under 35 who has treated his ears exceptionally
well over that time, otherwise anyone with "average" hearing would find
it hard to notice.

I personally notice that Dolby "B" noise reduction doesn't seem to
improve tape noise the way it used to 20 years ago ...       :-(

I would speculate that you could find a pattern of people noticing the
difference in quality inversely in line with their ages, (apart from
those young ones who have blasted their ears into senility with the
various types of aural abuse available these days).

That's a decidedly Microsoft spin on the story. The judge said it very
well [paraphrasing]: if Microsoft's products prevail in the
marketplace, it should be because they are better, not because
Microsoft uses its monopoly status to drive out competitors.

Subject: Re: Out the Door 


I too have been saying this for some time.  The programmers and
engineers of today have become as ubiquitous as the mechanics,
electricians, and equipment operators of old.  This gives unions a new
"market" to delve into.

However, I see the unions as having to make a change in the culture -
theirs and engineers.  In reading various ethics and professional
responsibilities letters and documents regarding engineers, the issue
of "professionalism" is the biggest block to unions.  Engineers are
professionals, they work in professional environments with other
professionals, and thus do not need a union.  This is not meant to be
disparaging to anyone (i.e. I am not saying union members are not
professionals). This is the culture that makes union introduction
difficult.  The best analogy I can think of is the military one of an
officer and a gentleman.  An officer is a gentleman by definition, and
if you aren't an officer, you are not a gentleman.  The truth of the
belief is not the issue, rather the existence of the belief creates
it's own truth.

Today engineers are everywhere, as opposed to being scarce.  When
higher education was limited to fewer people, you had a small pool of
engineers available.  They would be scarce, and like any scarce
commodity, they would be of great value.  They would be their own
class, and I believe that is the source of the "professional" belief
that works against unionization.  Bolstering the union case is the
fact that everyone has engineers - heck, in you have them designing
control systems for water usage is skyscrapers (how many engineers
does it take to program a toilet?).  I will be interesting to see if
there are forays into the white collar world by unions in the future.

Hack-proofing a website is hard enough.  But the task becomes gargantuan
when you accidentally publish the administrator's password on one of
your site's most heavily trafficked pages.

Such a security gaffe may have enabled unauthorized visitors to log in
and access files undetected for more than six months on a server
operated by Carmichael Lynch, a public relations and advertising firm
with several big-name clients.  The admin password was inadvertently
published on a page that contained online job postings.

Among the files potentially exposed to outsiders: internal documents,
including customer databases owned by two of the company's biggest
clients, Porsche and American Standard.

Experts said the incident is the latest example of how shoddy security
can undermine companies' privacy promises.

You've seen the slew of commercials for them.  You may already have one
in your pocket or hanging from your belt.  New generations of cell
phones appear before you've even figured out all the features of your
current model.

There's much more to consider regarding cellular technology beyond
incomprehensible user manuals and the highly visible phone radiation
and "driving while yakking" controversies.

The latest of these tiny wireless phones (the term "cellular" is now
out of favor, we're told) sport multimedia color displays, video
camera options, precision location tracking and a host of other
heavily promoted features set to hit the mainstream this year.

Yet little thought has been given to how these advanced capabilities
could affect society.

NEW YORK - Panasonic, Palm, Philips and other makers of cell phones,
handheld computers and electronic doodads would have you believe the
good times are rolling now like never before.

They may have a point.

More than 2,000 such companies are trucking their newest wares to Las
Vegas' International Consumer Electronics Show this week, promising to
overwhelm the city's gargantuan convention hall.  The show, which
features keynotes by chiefs of Sony, Microsoft and Intel, has normally
pessimistic analysts abuzz with a fervor that seems alien in times of
war and uncertainty.

By JOHN SCHWARTZ

As American companies increasingly move their software development
tasks out of their own offices to computer programming companies here
and abroad, new concerns are being raised about the security risks
involved.

Some of these concerns over the practice, known as outsourcing, are
being raised by people with an obvious self-interest - for example,
programmers who have seen their livelihoods shift to less expensive
operations overseas.  And the companies providing outsourcing services
argue that they take all necessary precautions to limit risk.  But the
question of whether the booming business in exporting high-tech jobs
is heightening the risk of theft, sabotage or cyberterrorism from
rogue programmers has been raised in discussions at the White House,
before Congress and in boardrooms.

Subject: Security Cameras are Getting Smart -- and Scary
Date: Mon, 6 Jan 2003 16:11:15 -0500


By Dean Takahashi
Mercury News

 From wealthy private homes to military installations, security cameras
are going high tech.

Prompted in part by new fears after the Sept.  11, 2001, terrorist
attacks, camera makers, security specialists, hard-disk makers and chip
designers are transforming the art of video surveillance, long known for
its grainy, black-and-white images and reams of tape.

With the new smart cameras, data is recorded in a digital format on hard
disk drives so that reviewing hours of surveillance is much easier.
Solar batteries let cameras run without the risk of failing because
somebody cut the power.

Data can be sent over the Internet -- often through wireless data
networks -- directly to a company's hard drive archives.  Processing
chips inside the cameras make the images much easier to discern, and new
software analyzes faces so that the cameras can send alerts to security
guards when they spot known criminals or suspicious movements.

	CRYPTO-GRAM, December 15, 2002
              by Bruce Schneier

                Counterattack


This must be an idea whose time has come, because I'm seeing it talked
about everywhere.  The entertainment industry floated a bill that
would give it the ability to break into other people's computers if
they are suspected of copyright violation.  Several articles have been
written on the notion of automated law enforcement, where both
governments and private companies use computers to automatically find
and target suspected criminals.  And finally, Tim Mullen and other
security researchers start talking about "strike back," where the
victim of a computer assault automatically attacks back at the
perpetrator.

The common theme here is vigilantism: citizens and companies taking
the law into their own hands and going after their assailants.
Viscerally, it's an appealing idea.  But it's a horrible one, and one
that society after society has eschewed.

Subject: Verizon Wireless to Expand Operations North of Pittsburgh


      Company Completes Acquisition of ALLTEL Wireless Business
      Serving Sections of Lawrence, Butler and Clarion Counties

    BEDMINSTER, N.J., Jan. 6 /PRNewswire/ -- Verizon Wireless, the
nation's largest wireless provider, today announced it has acquired
ALLTEL's controlling general partnership interest in a wireless
business north of Pittsburgh.  The acquisition is a major expansion of
the company's service footprint throughout portions of Lawrence,
Butler and Clarion Counties, Pennsylvania, including the city of New
Castle.

    Verizon Wireless operations now serve the entire western section
of Pennsylvania, from Lake Erie in the north, down to the border of
West Virginia in the south.

    Financial terms were not disclosed.

    The former ALLTEL operation covers a market with a total
population (POPS) of some 136,000.  Major highways in the footprint
include Interstates 80 and 79 and Route 60.  The business, operating
today under the ALLTEL brand, will be converted to the Verizon
Wireless brand in three to four months.  The existing analog wireless
network will be quickly integrated into the Verizon Wireless national
network and upgraded to digital CDMA service.

There are a great many more issues involved in this than what is being
presented in this post.  The point of this post indicates that
"collect calls from correctional facilities cost more than collect
calls from regular payphones and that is wrong."  While this is true,
there are other factors that are not addressed in this broadside that
fail to mention some of the reasons behind the high charges.

The locations an inmate can call are limited.  They cannot dial, as
examples, the members of the jury that convicted them, the prosecutors
(other than their office number - and not their direct number, but the
main number which is screened), witnesses, police officers, judges or
other court officers.  They also cannot call members of witness
families or other "undesireables."  The list of numbers for each
inmate is different and the cost of maintaining the database is paid
from the revenue collected from those calls.

> This appears to be a common practice across the U.S.

This is probably one of the uncontestable statements in the broadside,
but it is also incorrect.  Most of the correctional facilities
throughout the civilized world follow the same practices.  So the high
cost of calls is not just a "U.S." issue requiring redress, it is a
world-wide issue.

> People might argue "too bad, they're in prison!", but that misses
> several important points:

> It's not the inmate who's paying for the calls, but the family.
> Further, such families are often poor.

Many facilities allow the inmate to purchase phone time from
commissary credits or from funds sent from home.  These calls are
still handled at the higher rates, but the family is not billed for
these calls.  Additionally, the family always has the opportunity to
refuse the call.  This may sound callous, but if you know the cost of
the call is going to be billed to your phonebill and you don't have
the funds to pay for the call when the bill comes in, you can refuse
to accept the call.  This is called "fiscal responsibility."  This
also tends to become much less of a problem after calls begin to be
refused.  The inmate then begins to limit calls to essential
communications and not "I was bored and thought I would call."

Those high call charges are not "pure gravy."  Most people don't
realize that every call from an inmate telephone in a correctional
institution is recorded.  Additionally, there are those "unallowed
number" lists that have to be maintained.  Additionally, there are
additional expenses because of the high cost of the inmate instrument,
system administration, additional phone company charges because of
special handling and limited hours of operation and many other
factors.  Inmate phones are not the same as the ubiquitous payphone
you see on the street corner.  They have special armored cases, cords
and other parts.  The access to dial tone can be turned on and off and
many other controls that are not present on other phones and must be
maintained by someone, who needs a paycheck.

There are some institutions that do charge extra for long distance,
and receive revenue from the long distance carrier for those charges,
but then there are additional costs involved in handling all the
restrictions on an inmate by inmate basis.

A typical strawman argument.  The incidence of recidivism (sp?) or "an
inmate that can contact their family is less likely to return to
prison" is some thing that cannot be either proved or disproved.  The
question to ask here is: "What proof can you cite to prove your
argument?"

> Likewise, family contact reduces stress.  Stressed inmates get into

> frequent family contact is good for society.

It sure sounds good, and there may be a kernel of truth to the
statement, but again, where is your proof?  Cite some statistics that
are verifiable.  Yes, riots are costly, but what percentage of rioters
in prisons have no family contact?  What percentage of those involved
in fights and riots have regular phone privileges and use the phone
frequently?  I know from my work consulting to a department of
corrections that phone privileges are usually one of the last
privileges revoked from an inmate. 

They are often in trouble long before the privilege of using a
telephone is revoked.  And family contact is good for society?  What
about the inmate who calls a family member so they will go and attempt
to intimidate a witness?  Or the inmate who calls associates to keep
their criminal empire functioning?  These are not isolated incidents,
there are well documented cases of inmates running gangs, ordering
murders and mayhem and many other illegal activities. -- Remember, I
mentioned the calls are recorded?  The only calls that are not
reviewed are those between the client and their legal representative.
That doesn't mean the call isn't recorded, the recorder can't
discriminate to that level, but the content of the call is not
reviewed by court officials who screen the calls for illegal
activities.

The point I have been attempting to make is that there is a reason for
some of the high charges paid for telephone calls from correctional
institutions, and it is not to punish the families of the inmates but
to protect the society they harmed in the first place.

I know I am late on this topic, but I dont know if you see the entire
picture.

Most detention facilities do not have the labor for a telephone
monitor to escort inmates from their cells to another 'secure' area to
make a telephone call.  So to make these calls possible they install
phones in community areas, holding areas, even sometimes individual
cells.  An often overlooked element though is that it costs money to
install and maintain a telephone system where the physical CPE
equipment is abused and needs to be well protected (over-engineered
cords that dont come out and become used as weapons to strangle
people?) from both the users and the correctional staff.

Emotional Rant: I certainly dont want to see my taxes go up again to
support the jails and prisons, so why not have it as a 'user fee'
(Reagan was so fond of creating these mini taxes).

Yes it is a little expensive, but nobody forces them to talk on the
phone.  They can always visit or write letters like they did many
years ago.  Just another side to the story...

Horse hockey.  :-) We've discussed this one before, and the point most
people seem to be missing is that you will be able to keep your old TV
(assuming it still works - it seems 5-8 years is the average lifespan
of today's crappy TV sets) and still use it, providing you purchase a
set-top analog converter box.  Those boxes are available NOW although
they're expensive.  Five years down the road they'll be "cheap like
borscht".

Oh, but whoa is me, some consumers say.  Why should I have to pay
ANYTHING?  I already bought the TV, now you're telling me I've gotta
spend more to keep using it?

As Denis Leary once said: "Life sucks.  Get a ****ing helmet."

Or as Robert Heinlein once said (via a character in one of his
stories), "TANSTAAFL!" - or, "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free
Lunch"

It's hardly unfair, and the benefits to all of us far outweigh the
inconvenience for those who don't want to stay with the times.

I can just imagine the folks in Sweden, right around the time they
switched from driving on the left side of the road to the right side,
moaning and bitching about how they need protection for their
investments in their cars - which are now more difficult to drive
(y'ever try to execute a pass while driving a car that's on the
"wrong" side of the road?  You pretty much have to put the entire car
into the oncoming lane before you can even see if anything's coming).
The Swedes managed to do this, and cars are a much bigger investment
than TV's and VCR's.  So why are we crying so much about MAYBE not
being able to use a television set that, by the time analog signals
are phased out, will be worth maybe $40?

Can we just RELAX on this issue already?  :-)

(NOTE: before you argue that the broadcasters and studios want to
design this new digital equipment so that it CANNOT be used with
analog equipment, that is an entirely different issue - and I agree
that that would be "A Bad Thing"<tm> - but so far I don't see any
evidence that this will in fact come to pass.)

It sounds like you will have to order internet service from Verizon (oh 
for the days when this owuld have been considered an obvious violation 
of antitrust restrictions on "tying"), but nothing says you have to use 
that service rather than connecting to another ISP. Something in the 
contract may say that if you cancel the Verizon internet service they 
will also terminate your ISDN line, in which case you'll want to factor 
that extra monthly cost into your equations.

Good luck.

With ISDN being a switched line type, you can use any ISP that will
support the ISDN connection type.  Most ISP's using modern DSP based
'modems' can facilitate an ISDN link.

Most coding schemes get cracked sooner or later. When you're talking

Can phone and cable companies save the music industry? Their wires
are being used to steal a lot of copyrighted content, and the problem
gets worse every time a household with a teenager on the premises
signs up for a high-speed internet connection. A hot new disc used to
sell well for weeks, but now sales tail off quickly. When Napster
went offline, universities saw traffic volumes drop by a third or
more on the high-speed pipes that connect their campuses to the web.
But neo-Napsters have sprung up all over. The music business is less

NEW YORK - Everybody knows that breaking up is hard to do, but the
dismantling of Ma Bell must have set some sort of record. Two decades
have passed since a federal judge ordered an end to the old AT&T
monopoly, yet its four surviving Hydra heads -- better known as the
Baby Bells -- continue to dominate local phone service. 

Congress took another shot at fostering local competition in 1996,
but missed the mark. Now, it seems, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) may hand the Bells a long-sought victory by
scrapping a rule that requires them to lease their equipment and
lines to local-service rivals at cheap wholesale rates. 

Published reports today indicate that the FCC staff is recommending
that the rule be substantially modified. The final decision would be
made next month by FCC Chairman Michael Powell and his fellow
commissioners, who are expected to go along with the proposed change.

%T   "Building Linux Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"

Like "Practical UNIX and Internet Security" (cf. BKPRUISC.RVW) this
book so thoroughly covers its general field, in this case virtual
private networks (VPNs), that it is useful to security people
regardless of whether or not they use Linux.  There are abundant
practical considerations in this work that other volumes ignore.

Part one deals with the basics of VPNs.  Chapter one is a good,
readable, realistic introduction (and we will accept the mention of 40
bit DES in IPSec as a typo: it is listed as such in the errata at the
associated website, http://www.buildinglinuxvpns.net).  The title of
chapter two, VPN fundamentals, is oddly both true and not: the items
mentioned are not factors of VPNs as such, but aspects and
considerations of VPNs that influence network choices, and network
configurations that impel VPN architecture.

Part two covers implementing standard VPN protocols.  Chapter three
provides a detailed and clear explanation of PPP (Point-to-Point
Protocol) over SSH (Secure Shell).  PPP over SSL (Secure Sockets
Layer)/TLS (Transport Layer Security), in chapter three, outlines the
basics, increased security, and scripts for troubleshooting.
Excellent coverage of IPSec in general, plus some implementation
details in Linux, is in chapter five.  Chapter six explains FreeS/WAN
from philosophy to source to configuration.  There is good analysis of
the design and weaknesses of PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol)
and how to run it on Linux, in chapter seven.

Part three examines the implementation of nonstandard VPN protocols.
Chapter eight looks at the design, options, and setup of VTun.  The
lightweight cIPe is covered in chapter nine.  Designed for user level
rather than kernel operation, as well as more modern and robust
cryptography, tinc is explained in chapter ten.

I have not found, to date, a book that does a better job of explaining
the concepts and operations of virtual private networks.  This should
become the classic text.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The *only* reason for forcing GM (Ma
Bell) to sell Chevrolets at a discount with a Ford Logo is because all
the Johnny-come-latelys in the phone business (beginning with the
original offender, MCI, followed by Sprint and God-only-knows how many
others since) is because *none* of them felt that *they* should be 
imposed on to lay wire, develop outside plant or invest in a century 
of research as Bell had to do. MCI got into business by filing a 
fraudulent application with the Illinois Commerce Commission and 
selling a bill of goods to a generally hostile (anti-Bell) public. 
With that, they were off and running. Then every 'competitor' following 
has used the same tactics, i.e. 'why should we have to do a century of
hard labor and brain power to develop a telephone network when we can
eat from Bell's table *and* force them to sell to us at a discount so
that we in turn can undercut them with the damn fools of the public
who still feel Bell is rotten.'

Judge Harold Greene, not especially known for his brilliant juris-
prudence, used his cronies in the United States 'Justice' Department
to give MCI everything they asked for on a silver platter. Or maybe
they used him ... If there had been, or is ever going to be fair
competion in the phone business, the 'competitors' will need to 
all the legwork Bell did for a century or so, then when they have
their own outside plant, wires, cables in place, a decent judge,
making a fair decision can order Bell to open their front door and
hand out a bunch of pairs for interconnection purposes, and order
Bell to be fair and equitable in number assignments and/or portability.
That is *all* that should be required of Bell.  PAT]

Fortunately, there are many sources of proof for this argument.

"As perhaps one of the most important policy matters at stake, there
is abundant empirical research, as well as common sense, that informs
the Commission that encouraging family members to remain intact helps
to lower recidivism. Research findings from the Florida House of
Representatives indicate that "family and community contacts can play
a very important role in helping released offenders avoid returning to
prison."  ("Maintaining Family Contact When a Family Member Goes to
Prison: An Examination of State Policies on Mail, Visiting, and
Telephone Access," Florida House of Representatives, Justice Council,
Committee on Corrections, November 1998.) In fact, Finding No.1 of the
Florida Legislature noted the strong connection between familial
contact and reduced recidivism. (See Id. at 3)

The importance and impact of this research can not be underestimated.
Sound public policy dictates that revenue and rates for prison calls
be mitigated against the public cost of repeat offenders. The public
interest in providing affordable and accessible access to phone
contact must be recognized by the Commission as a primary mitigation
against permitting significant changes in rate regulation. (See
Attachment One for Editorial Board Article from the San Francisco
Chronicle)" http://www.ucan.org/law_policy/teledocs/prisonfcc.html

"The Corrective Services research department has indicated that the
lowest rates of recidivism are associated with the maintenance of
family ties and the ability of the outside carers to maintain the
material and the emotional basesof the prisoners 'home' (Dewdney et
al. 1978)." http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/proceedings/16/Larman.pdf

By the way, in most states, based on some quick crack research, it is the
prisoner who gives information on individuals to call, which are then 
screened and approved by the appropriate officials. Thus, it is an 
affirmative system (requires approval), not a denial system (prisoner 
can call everyone except certain groups).

Legally, revoking phone privileges is difficult, because a prisoner has a 
right to contact his or her representatives.

These statistics are hard to come by, as you know, but they are out
there in the academic journals, which are not on the (public) web. If
I get time, and if others are interested, I might look them up.

As I said, called parties are generally screened by the prison, in most 
states. 

Also, often funds go to the general fund. California Senate Bill 1978
(2000) stated "Billing rates for collect telephone calls from prisons
include a 33-to 43-percent commission beyond the provider's costs,
which in 1998 generated $16 million for the General Fund of the
state." Thus, funds do not go to service those costs, as is alleged.

"I think that, if there's one clear theme in "Star Wars," it's that
no one *has* a family.	Or not for long." -- John Kensmark


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Prisoners (in Illinois at least, and
I assume most states) are NOT permitted to 'have feelings' or
'opinions' or ideas about anything. If prisoners were allowed to
have ideas on their own, or feelings, next thing you know, they might
decide to try and act on their feelings/ideas. Where would the corr-
ections industry be in that case?  And God forbid they should actually
build a prison right in Chicago, where the wives and mothers and
children could actually hop on a local bus to get there and visit for
a few minutes every day or two. The federal government at least is
smart enough to have a prison right in downtown Chicago (about a 
block up the street from Dunkin Donuts; on the corner of Van Buren
and Clark Streets). A modern, twenty story highrise building; you 
could not even tell it was a prison if you did not know that fact.

I was downtown one day with a friend; after we had had lunch I walked
with her back to the train station where she was getting a train to
go home. This was in the days before cell phones; I wanted to make a
quick call and stopped to use a payphone in the lobby of the federal
prison. She sat in a chair in the lobby while I went in the payphone
booth. When I came out she said, "my, what a nice building this is;
is it an office building or an apartment complex?"  I told her it was
the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal penitentiary. She
got these big saucer like eyes, found it hard to believe. I told her
"the men who are in here are here in the custody of the Attorney 
General of the United States or his authorized representative."  I had
just said that when a door opened and a group of men came in, with
a woman (female guard) escorting them. They had all been over at the
nearby federal courthouse (across the street from Dunkin Donuts) for
the daily court hearings for prisoners. Many of them had cups of
coffee or beverages and donuts in hand. Obviously the female guard
had let them stop in Dunkin Donuts on the way back from court. 

"Stop and stand here," said the lady. The men all obediently stopped
there while she signed herself and them back in with the receptionist
in the lobby. "Go fetch the elevator and wait for me to get on with
you," she said. The handful of men walked over, called the elevator
and waited for her. 

My friend said, "aren't they afraid those guys will run off, etc"
I told her, "they wouldn't dare ... they are too smart to do that."
The feds even allow a select number of the guys to walk around 
downtown on their own to do shopping each day, or go to work. They 
have to be in and out at a certain time, *or* be treated as an
escaped prisoner. The guys know better than to try that. In many 
respects, the feds are so much more enlightened on prison reform issues
and proper care of inmates than the states are. The prisoners know
that if they cannot make do at MCC, their next stop may be Marion, IL
or Terre Haute, IN.  The feds know it also, so they all smile
graciously at each other and the prisoners stay in line.   PAT]

The divide is actually between users who are willing to have their
clicks tracked and those who don't. Someone has to pay for the
services on these machines, and advertising is the payment
mechanism. Therefore, I agree to have ads placed on my screen *when
they come from the site I'm visiting*.  However, I draw the line at
ads served from Doubleclique et al, since the associated loss of
privacy is outside of the implied agreement. Of course, one could say
that the cookies are part of the agreement, but I disagree: the ads on
TV or billboards or newspapers don't phone home and tell their
originators who looked.

FWIW.

Put a Linux box in between the cable/DSL box and your LAN. Set it for DHCP,
and change the dhcpd.conf file to give addresses only to hosts with known

Subject: TiVo, Brother & Aspyr Announce Rendezvous Networked Products


CES, LAS VEGAS and MACWORLD EXPO, SAN FRANCISCO-January 7, 2003-The
rapid adoption of Rendezvous continues with TiVo, Brother and
Aspyr today announcing new products incorporating Rendezvous
networking.  Rendezvous is Apple's innovative networking technology
for automatic discovery and connection of devices over
industry-standard IP networks such as Ethernet and 802.11 wireless
networks. Using Rendezvous, consumer devices such as stereos and
digital video recorders can automatically find and "talk" to any Macs
on their local wired or wireless network, making it possible for users
to stream audio from iTunes to their home stereo and display
iPhotos on their TVs.

Free (marginal cost) plus an illicit thrill beats $10 for the ticket,
$5 for the soda and snacks and the knowledge that you're lining the
pockets of people you believe to be despicable.

It's amazing to watch the proprietors of an almost entirely
discretionary industry working so hard to make their customers wish
them ill. It's as if McDonalds hired greeters at every franchise to
shout at people, "We think you're stupid for eating our food! Go

I received a junk fax with no CSID.

The fax did, however, have a number to fax your *order* to.

So I set my scanner on "photo" and scanned the back of a paper pad.

I sent five pages of this ... took 35 minutes at 14,400 ;-)

Since 1991 the Telephone Consumers Protection Act (TCPA) has
prohibited these, or more specifically, "the transmission of any
material advertising the commercial availability or quality of any
product, service or property to any person without that person's prior
express permission or request."

The law is 47 USC 227 and the FCC regulations that implement the law
are 47 CFR 64.1200.

Same as it's been since 1991.  Unsolicited faxed ads are completely
illegal, and you can sue the sender for $500 per fax.

> I understand the law has been challenged in court.

There is one decision by Judge Limbaugh in Missouri that has found the
law to be unconstitutional.  But the law has been upheld in many
appeals courts, his decision is currently under appeal, and he's
apparently well-known for peculiar decisions that don't stand up on
appeal, so few if any other courts are treating it as a precedent.

Subject: Cyberspace Artists Paint Themselves Into a Corner


By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL

In a 1950's horror movie the Thing was a creature that killed before
it was killed. Now in a real-life drama playing on a computer screen
near you, the Thing is an Internet service provider that is having
trouble staying alive. Some might find this tale equally terrifying.

The Thing provides Internet connections for dozens of New York 
artists and arts organizations, and its liberal attitude allows its 
clients to exhibit online works that other providers might 
immediately unplug. As a result the Thing is struggling to survive 
online. Its own Internet-connection provider is planning to 
disconnect the Thing over problems created by the Thing's clients. 
While it may live on, its crisis illustrates how difficult it can be 
for Internet artists to find a platform from which they can push the 
medium's boundaries.

Wolfgang Staehle, the Thing's founder and executive director, said the
high-bandwidth pipeline connecting the Thing to the Internet would be
severed on Feb. 28 because its customers had repeatedly violated the
pipeline provider's policies. While the exact abuses are not known,
they probably involve the improper use of corporate trademarks and
generating needless traffic on other sites.

If Mr. Staehle is unable to establish a new pipeline, the 100 Web
sites and 200 individual customers, mostly artists, that rely on the
Thing for Internet service could lose their cyberspace homes. In a
telephone interview from the Thing's office in Chelsea, Mr. Staehle
(pronounced SHTAW-luh) said, "It's not fair that 300 of our clients
will suffer from this and I might be out of business."

The Thing's pipeline is currently supplied by Verio Inc. of Englewood,
Colo., which declines to comment on its troubles with the
Thing. Mr. Staehle said that he had not received official word from
Verio, but that the company's lawyers told the Thing the service would
be cut off because of the violations.

Subject: Apple Ramps up Wireless in Notebooks


By Ephraim Schwartz

SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple not only introduced an industry first notebook
with a 17-inch display, it also became the first major company to
deploy as yet unapproved technology for Wi-Fi access.

Although the aircraft aluminum packaging, the screen size, the backlit
keyboard and the 800Mbps Firewire port are innovative, the use of what
is called IEEE 802.11g is just plain daring. It underscores Apple's
willingness to take a calculated risk on a nascent technology that has
to date not been ratified as a standard by the IEEE Wi-Fi committee.

Approval of IEEE 802.11g is expected. It has the unique feature of
using the same bandwidth as B -- 2.4GHz -- thus making it backward
compatible with B while giving the same performance of the far faster
IEEE 802.11a standard which runs at 55Mbps.

There are two levels of risk in deploying a G product, according to 
Brian Grimm, a spokesperson for the Wi-Fi Alliance.

Hello,

I need to reproduce this situation:

1- There is one primary station;
2- There are 2 secondary stations (01, and 02);
3- The primary station set an NRM communication to both secondary stations
in sequence (with the commands: XID, SNRM having the secondary station
address);
4- The primary station send data (Information Frame, numbered) to both
tributary stations simultaneously using the broadcast address FF;
5- The primary station is linked to both the secondaries stations by the
mean of the same serial port.

I wish to get a PCI board and the correspondent software drivers that can
permit me to handle the protocol programmatically by the mean of a certain
language like the C language.
The Operative System is Windows2000.

Can you suggest me a product for reach my goal, please?

This actually strengthens the analogy.  Prior to the change, those who
bought left-hand drive cars knew what they were getting into.  Perhaps
they knew the Big Change was coming, but regardless: they knew at the
time of purchase that the car they were buying had a disadvantage
today (but might have an advantage tomorrow).

Once the Big Change occured, there were still some people with
right-hand drive.  These people are in exactly the same position that
the analog TV people will be in once 2009 or whatever date they
eventually settle on comes to pass - except that there'll be cheap
equipment available to overcome the disadvantage (I'm sure converting a
car from right hand drive to left hand drive can't be a cheap or easy
proposition!)

Dragging and kicking some people will be dragged into the 21st century.
 :-)

The point here is that the move to DTV is not change for the sake of
change.  DTV is a huge, HUGE improvement over NTSC - it's progress,
pure and simple, and I don't think such a tremendous improvement in
the overall quality of television should be held back (or held off
completely) because of a few people who won't want to spend fifty
bucks on a converter when the time comes - again, assuming their
existing analog sets still work at all when the time comes.

And anyone buying an expensive analog TV today, knowing what's coming,
is a complete idiot who gets what he/she deserves.  If you're
convinced that analog is doomed and that converter equipment will
never be made available, fine - either make do with what you've got
for now (and buy new in 2009), or if your current set is pretty much
toast now, buy something just good enough to get you through the next
six years.  A $5000 bigscreen that isn't digital/HDTV is a stupid,
stupid purchase right now - especially since, when it comes to big
screens, HDTV's are not really much more expensive than analog and are
"future proof".

Pat, you gave an excellent answer and then illustrated it with a
wonderful example from your time in Chicago.  What a great many people
do not understand, or refuse to understand, is that a person in a
correctional institution is there for a specific purpose.  That
purpose is punishment for harming society.  The mistaken idea that
making telephone calls whenever you want is a right and not a
privilege is forgotten by someone who never had a reason to be
severely punished for an aggravated wrong against society.

People in prisons are there because they have proven themselves
incapable of acting in a normal society.  Because they have been put
away from society as punishment, certain privileges -- which a lot of
people confuse with rights -- have to be resticted.  The use of a
telephone is not a right, it is not one of the rights guaranteed under
the constitution.  If it was a right, then why do I have to pay for
the telephone I have in my office or at my home.  If it is a right,
then the government should provide it to me.  Freedom of speech is a
right, and the restrictions on telephones in correctional institutions
does not abridge that right.  What is the difference between a
prisoner's right to criticize the government than any other citizen's?
Absolutely none.  Prisoners can criticize the government or other
institutions just as freely as you or I, but their ability to
broadcast that criticism is limited because of circumstances of their
own choosing.  No one forced them to take action against society.  It
was their own free choice to perform an act or acts that society has
ruled is not in its interest.  Because of their choice, and their
actions, they have put themselves in a position where the state,
society, has limited their ability to perform acts against society.

Being able to do something because they want to do it is not a right,
it is a privilege.  Prisoners can't drive cars.  Even if they still
hold a valid driver license they can't drive.  Is this a right that
has been taken from them?  No, it is a privilege that has been
revoked.  If you can't abide by the rules society has placed on your
ability to exercize a privilege, then that privilege should be taken
away until you demonstrate your ability to abide with the rules.

As Joey Lindstrom would probably say if he joined in the thread -
"Horse Hockey!"  Using a telephone from a correctional facility is a
privilege and not a right.  If you are going to use a telephone that
can conceivably connected to any other telephone, then there have to
be restrictions on that telephone if you have proven yourself
incapable of abiding by the restrictions society has placed on
behavior.  Someone has to pay for maintaining those temporary
restrictions, and currently it is the person or persons who accept
calls from correctional institutions.

While the thread is interesting, it is serving no real purpose than to
perpetuate the illogical premise that a person who has proven
themselves incapable of operating within the bounds set by society
deserves the same rights and privileges of a person who does operate
within the set bounds.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: As the recent television commercial
says in promoting Walgreen's Drug Stores, what you say is correct in
the town called 'Perfect'. You seem to be forgetting however that most
of us live in what is becoming an increasingly corrupt society where
(among other things) police officers and prosecutors put much pressure
on forensic technicians to 'adjust' the evidence to give them a
'favorable' conclusion. Consider the scandalous affair in Oklahoma
City last year where the two bit prostitute who had a job working for
police -- as a forensic technician, mind you, (her name was Joyce
something, guys in Oklahoma can fill in the blanks here) openly
admitted she had been pressured by police to claim the DNA evidence
matched in *five* rape cases police were working on -- it did not.
In two other cases, semen found in the victim of the rape matched up
but that was false also. There were a half-dozen or so other more
'insignificant' crimes where Joyce fingered the perps incorrectly. 
Joyce claimed her police supervisors had promised to give her a raise
in pay if she would 'work along with them'. The Oklahoma governor
wound up letting about a dozen guys out of prison who had been falsely
put there based on the forensic technician's word. 

In Chicago, in 1999, after the Chicago Tribune ran a five part series
on 'prosecutorial misconduct' detailing how prosecutors thought
nothing of making up all sorts of lies -- and in two cases were
disbarred because of their behavior -- the prosecutor's screamed
bloody murder: didn't the Tribune realize how important their work
was at getting scum off the streets and into prison? The Illinois
governor wound up releasing **23** men from 'death row' who were not
guilty. Gee, said police, we sure hope there were no hard feelings
in this matter. 

In New York City -- one of the most corrupt police forces in the
nation, where an entire police precinct had to be demolished and
rebuilt from scratch after not a single honest police officer could be
found there -- in another precinct five police officers take a dislike
to an immigrint person in custody and proceed to sodomize him with a
broom stick. Then the other police officers in that facility decide 
to honor their bizzare 'blue code' and not confess what was done. 

These examples are not exceptions to the rule in this make-believe
town of 'Perfect'; this is how things are getting to be. Police
are no better than anyone else; they just get away with what they do
because they have a badge and uniform. So please pardon me if I take
the little guy's side in this matter. The real victims are the people
who got robbed, looted, sexually assaulted and beaten up of course,
and then assumed the Keystone Kops of America the Beautiful would
protect them and prosecute the wrong-doers. Instead, the Keystone Kops
sit down to connive, make up lies and stories about it, select at
random the weak people who can do little or nothing to defend them-
selves, define them as 'scum', lock them up often times for the rest
of their lives, and tell their friends at the newspapers, look what
a great job we are doing.  

And you suggest the little guys have no right to stay in touch with
their representatives without imprimatuer from the prison??? I would
sort of expect that kind of response from one of the bottom feeders
who makes a living with money from the corrections industry.   PAT]

Hey, y'know, I think I can come up with a pretty powerful argument
against allowing such calls, or at least stringently limiting them. 
It's such a wild, "out there" idea that you may have trouble grasping
the concept, but try to stay with me on this.  OK?  Here goes.

BECAUSE HE'S IN FREAKIN' PRISON!!!

It's not a damned country club.  It's PRISON.  We as a society have
decided that there are a certain group of people that we just can't
live with, at least until they clean up their acts.  Sure, in an ideal
world it might be nice if everybody could be treated absolutely equally
no matter what, but let's face it: some people renege on their
membership dues.

Pat, let me ask you this.  If the prison system were changed the way
you would have them change it, exactly what would be the incentive for
people to want to avoid coming back to prison after their release? 
Even as it stands now, with colour TV's, weight rooms, conjugal visits,
etc., many prisoners now enjoy a standard of life as good as, or
better, than they had outside.  Isn't the idea to:

A) Punish, and
B) Encourage better future behaviour (by making people not want to
return to prison)?

Boy, I'll bet you're a real fan of Sheriff Joe down there in Arizona
huh?  :-)

Subject: Verizon Building at Ground Zero Returns to Life
Date: Thu, 9 Jan 2003 01:23:00 -0500


On Monday, January 6, 2003, The New York Times published an article
"Herculean Effort to Restore a Landmark Battered on 9/11".

Article at http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/06/nyregion/06VERI.html

The gist of the story:

The Verizon building at 140 West Street in Manhattan, New York City,
was built as The New York Telephone Building in 1926.  It was a
central office as well as an office building, and was the corporate
headquarters for New York Telephone for a while (not recently).

The building was built to withstand the great weight of the mechanical
switching equipment of the 1920s, which put the building in a good
position to limit damage from the terrorist attack at the World Trade
Center across the street.  Steel beams from the collapsing Trade
Center flew into the Verizon building, some of which tore off 8
stories of an outside wall and pounded through several concrete floor
slabs.  The slabs were designed to bear 250 to 300 pounds per square
foot.

Switching equipment was exposed to the elements for many months.  In
some cases the floor had fallen away under computer equipment which
was found hanging from power cables from above.

The building lost commercial power and its generators became useless
when the generator rooms in some of the five basement levels flooded.
Battery power held up most of the equipment until 10:21 PM on the day
of the attack.

To restore service to Wall Street area buildings, including the
exchanges, new cables were run at street level to other central
offices.  Cables entering the vault of 140 West Street were cut off
with chain saws and spliced to new cables.

The CO supported 300,000 POTS lines and 4.5 million data curcuits.
Not all of those needed to be restored: 35,000 of the POTS lines
served the WTC and did not need to be re-established.  There are now
34,000 POTS lines being served from restored switches at 140 West
Street and the building is again earning revenue for Verizon.  Office
staff won't move back in until late 2003.

Bronze work of whales, pelicans and sea horses that ornaments an
entranceway on the side facing 7 World Trade Center was mostly
destroyed.  Restorers are copying the bronze work from a second
entrance to restore the destroyed one.

The article in the printed newspaper is accompanied by a photo of a
broken terra-cotta cinder block wall facing out onto the site of the
collapsed 7 WTC.  There is also a photo of a portion of a magical
mural showing a candlestick-style telephone on a sunburst background
on a blue field with a gold surround.  And a photo of linen murals on
the ceiling of a vaulted lobby.  They will be cleaned and restored,
too.  The web version only has the first photo.

%T   "Internet and Intranet Security Management: Risks and Solutions"

There is a heavy emphasis, in the preface, on the book's being up to
date.  Yet the very first article relies on survey data that was three
years old at the time the essay was written.

Part one supposedly talks about the state of the (security, one
assumes) art.  Chapter one is a vague and superficial look at random
topics and technology related to security, plus results of the
aforementioned opinion poll.  A list of Internet security problems,
and solutions that are not connected to the difficulties, make up
chapter two.

Part two deals with managing Internet security.  Chapter three has
terse descriptions of a number of theories of trust, related to some
generic security concepts.  There are brief overviews of the TCSEC
(Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria), Common Criteria, and
not-really-the-BS7799 in chapter four.  Out of thirty three pages in
chapter five, three discuss the general subject of Web security, while
there is almost nothing on the titular topic of management of Web
security.

Part three reviews cryptographic and technical security standards. 
(There are a great many grammatical errors, and the authors use
almost-but-not-quite standard terminology.)  Chapter six is an
opinionated piece, but does touch on some basic cryptographic ideas. 
Myths and limitations of cryptography are listed in chapter seven. 
Chapter eight has descriptions, that are both overly technical and
incomplete, of ISO cryptographic standards.

Part four talks about law and security.  Chapter nine discusses
privacy, but only in regard to employer monitoring of employee email. 
The weaknesses of the New Zealand privacy law are commented on in
chapter ten.

It is difficult to say that any audience would benefit from this vague
collection of unfocused ideas.

Subject: Re: What is Relation Between DTMF, v.22 and Hayes Commands?


> Can anyone on this list explain this to me?

Entirely different beasts all of them.

DTMF: Dual-Tone Multifrequency.  This is a set of tones used by customer
equipment to signal information to the Public Switched Telephone Network
in an inband fashion.  The grid of tones in Hz is:

	1209	1336	1477	1633
697	 1	 2	 3	 A
770	 4	 5	 6	 B
852	 7	 8	 9	 C
941	 *	 0	 #	 D

The A through D tones were used in the US Military's Autovon system.
When you dial a phone number and hear musical tones as you press the
buttons, that's DTMF.

V.22: ITU-T (formerly CCITT) standard for transmitting 1200 bit per
second duplex data over the PSTN or leased lines.  It's compatible
with the Bell 212A standard.  V.22 bis covers 2400 bps, V.32 covers
9600 bps, V.32 bis covers 14400 bps and lower, V.34 covers up to 28800
bps, V.34 bis covers up to 33600 bps, etc.

Hayes commands: A cryptic command set (that every old BBSer still probably
has memorized) that was developed in 1981 by Hayes to control their
modems.  Quickly was picked up by most of the rest of the industry.  The
commands start with AT which stands for Attention.  A command like ATA
makes the modem go into answer mode.  A command like ATDT*67,14144761989
makes your modem dial 1-414-476-1989 and prepend it with *67 to block
caller ID.  There's literally a hundred or more commands that eventually
made it into the more featured modems.  I'm sure a quick Google search
would come up with many lists.

I have a hard time seeing that. I am a total Hollywood junkie. I
regularly attend movies at Bay Area theaters. I have thousands of DVDs
(all duly purchased) that I view on a 120" screen (and suitably
matching sound system) at home. I have never had the slightest desire
to download a movie off the Internet to watch on my computer.

On this point, we are in full agreement. I have never seen an industry
treat its own customers like potential criminals like the
entertainment industry does. If it would do what it does best (produce
entertainment) and stop worrying about this control freak obsession
from which it suffers, it would go on making bucket-loads of money
 ... just as it always has.

I have always maintained if the public knew that it could buy a
reasonably-priced high-quality DVD of a film within a short period
after its theatrical release that the bootleg industry would be dealt
a serious blow. So far, reality confirms that. Furthermore, studios
are discovering that the DVD market is pure gold.

Oops.  I knew that ;-)

After I posted it, I was thinking there was something wrong with what I had
done ... that was my dad's exchange, and there was something that
bothered me about it, lingering after the post.  Then I remembered, his
exchange was Mullberry, or something like that, which I found in
I-don't-know-what source, but I happened to see on the side of an
abandoned Southern Pacific railroad station not far from his house.
It was so long ago that I found that bit of trivia, that I had forgotten
that it wasn't the NANPA that revealed it to me.

Correct. The FCC saw all that valuable spectrum in the VHF TV bands
and realized that it could get a really nice price for it from telecom
companies. But first it had to dump the TV broadcasters ... and get
the public to approve of the deal in the bargain. The elixir: DTV
 ... or more precisely, HDTV. Wow!

And how about the TV stations that simply use the digital spectrum for
several low-res programs rather than HDTV? Or worse, how about the
stations that just sell the high-speed data stream to outside parties
and only use a portion of it for TV broadcasting per se? I think you
will find that the issue is a little more complex than spending fifty
bucks on a converter.

Anyone buying a digital set today may find himself in exactly the same 
situation. As we speak, those same folks who are pushing for "closing 
the analog hole" are also pushing for a re-design of the digital 
standards to include the "broadcast flag" and many other "rights 
management" features that will make today's system completely obsolete.

That would be a wise choice for everyone at this stage of DTV 
development, especially with the copyright industry pushing long and 
hard to make sure that the public is hamstrung at every turn. There are 
many in Congress who listen very hard to major campaign contributors in 
Hollywood.

That anything one buys today with regard to DTV is "future proof" relies 
on a very shaky premise indeed.

Joey,

Do you really, *really* believe that DTV is about quality?

I mean, that's what they're trying to sell it to you based on.  But do you
REALLY believe that?

It's not about quality.  Tossing aside the obvious advantages of
digital with respect to the control it gives the content providers,
DTV is all about QUANTITY.  That's right; it won't be HDTV when it all
shakes out.  It'll be SDTV, and it'll be 4 times as much.  The average
American doesn't want quality, he wants quantity.  And let's face it:
nobody wants to see the hairs on Roseanne Barr's face in all their
glory.

No, Americans want MORE CHANNELS.  And the industry will be happy to
take the bandwidth they have and shove 4 times as many COMMERCIALS
down our throats.

Ah, the glory of not giving a damn.  I don't really care; I won't buy
a converter box, because I've hated converter boxes since before you
were born.  I have TVs and VCRs with perfectly good tuners, thank you.
I don't need a clunky box in the middle to prevent me from using those
tuners.

And I really don't need those commercials, either.  Hollywood is
wondering why I'm not watching TV anymore.  Maybe it has to do with
commercial time creeping up into the 20 minutes per hour range.  (I
watched the Carol Burnett special a couple years ago, and taped it in
case I wanted to keep it.  I paused during the commercials.  Including
opening and closing credits, the total amount of actual program time
was 40 minutes.  That's right -- forty minutes.)

My cable company raised their rates a couple bucks this past November.
I called them and started asking questions about how much I pay, and I
told her right up front: I'm looking around.  I told her that I was
unhappy with paying more money for the privilege of seeing these
commercial stations that are shoving more and more minutes per hour of
commercials down my throat.  She immediately -- IMMEDIATELY -- offered
to rescind the increase for me for the next 12 months.

I do get tired of the commercial channels charging the cable companies
more per subscriber every year, only to then increase the commercial
content.

The FCC said quite a while ago that a PC with a fax modem is a fax
machine for the purpose of the TCPA, and nobody hates junk faxes as
much as someone with a virtual fax farm with a range of DID numbers
attached to fax modems to give all the users their own numbers, which
a junker sequences through dumping junk into each number.

There's no case law I know about fax-to-email systems.  I don't know
whether eFax or the subscriber would have standing to sue.  eFax
certainly doesn't like junk faxes, and they have a web page where you
can report the junk fax, attest that it's indeed junk from someone you

Of course.  But they'd better have documentation that will persuade a
judge that they're not blowing smoke.  Particularly after they've
heard a few cases, judges get pretty sceptical about anything that
junk faxers say.

             Digital-Cable Ready Television

Companies Announce Plans to Begin Testing in 2003 of Independently 
             Developed POD/Host Technology

    LAS VEGAS, Jan. 8 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Motorola,
Inc. (NYSE:MOT) Broadband Communications Sector and Pioneer
Electronics (USA) Inc. today announced that they will begin testing
procedures to assure compatibility between Motorola's MediaCipher(R)
conditional access system and Pioneer's plasma (flat screen)
High-Definition (HD) compatible TVs. The test is the first of its kind
to bring together independently developed POD (point of deployment)
and plasma HD compatible TV Host technology, and marks the beginning
for establishing a real framework for support of DTV receivers,
digital recorders with secure interfaces, and other devices for cable
systems.  

Motorola recently expanded its MediaCipher conditional access system
to include an OpenCable(TM) POD module, in adherence to the FCC
requirements to offer completely separable security for consumer
electronics devices. Pioneer has developed a basic digital cable ready
television that targets compatibility with OpenCable POD modules such
as the Motorola MediaCipher POD.  The two companies' engineering
efforts will be in compliance with CableLabs OpenCable Host
specification and proposed technical standards currently under review
by the Federal Communications Commission.  

The OpenCable compatibility testing will begin at the Motorola
MediaCipher integration lab in San Diego, CA as the first step towards
the anticipated rollout of compliant consumer TVs in 2003, based on
FCC approval of technical standards.

By Jeremy Pelofsky

    WASHINGTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - Consumer advocates on
Wednesday slammed the latest round of rate hikes for cable
television service and said they would push Congress to
intervene to protect consumers.

    The Federal Communications Commission last week reported
that cable rates skyrocketed 6.3 percent during the 12 months
ended June 30, 2002, almost six times the 1.1 percent rate of
inflation and cable operators over the last several weeks have
unveiled a new round of price hikes.

    Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America
rejected assertions by cable operators that the rate hikes are
due to rising programming costs as well as upgrading their
networks since their operating margins are widening.

That's right, they sold off the now out of core analog tv spectrum so
Slick Willy Clinton could balance the federal budget.  That is what
the change was all about, now they are crying because it turns out
nobody wants that previously overvalued spectrum due the the telecom
bubble bursting.

I have seen no such converters yet, and the deadline for ALL stations
(even non commercial) to be digital is only a few short months away on
May 1, 2003.  In fact, Congress is being pressured to outlaw ANY new
device with an analog video output from being sold.  So much for these
cheap DTV convertors if this actually happens.

2006 is the current cutoff.  Some talk has been made about making it
2007 instead.  Also, until (H )DTV is available to 85% of people in a
given market, analog wont go away, but they are trying to eliminate
that rule now also which can be accomplished by making cable carry
(H)DTV since 80%+ of viewers are on cable anyway.  These viewers will
use the set top box the cable company gives them to convert to analog.
That just forces the remaining <20% of viewers who use OTA to buy the
recievers.

Very true, although most (H)DTV sets I've seen do NOT include an 8VSB
tuner, which maybe isn't so bad since tuners are constantly being
improved over the earlier generations which seemed to have some
problems.

The High Def will not improve anything I see on TV.  Most of what is
on TV is crap and will remain crap whether in NTSC or High Def. The
average viewer only cares who Aly McBeal is sleeping with this week,
not the quality of the picture.  Most places I walk into have a
terrible quality picture and the viewer doesn't seem to notice.  I'm
used to seeing broadcast quality video so I do notice (I'm a
transmitter man for a TV station).

I put the "H" in parenthesis because there is no FCC requirement for
any broadcaster to use High Definition, only DTV.  There are 18
different formats of DTV, only a few of which are High Def.

I can believe that studio and theater executives would like to have
total control over who can view movies and where they can view them.
A significant amount of revenue is being generated by selling
advertising that must be viewed by the captive theater audience.
People who went to the theater have generally been treated to various
screen advertising while waiting for the movie to start. However, now
the operators are forcing patrons to sit through additional
advertising after the appointed starting time, after the lights have
dimmed.

While this has traditionally been a time for showing previews of
coming attractions it's more often now a series of commercials for
Coke, local businesses, etc.

A few minutes of sponsorship is certainly nothing to complain
about. But during a recent trip to the theater to watch the latest
James Bond movie we had to sit through a full 20 minutes of
commercials (not previews!) after the designated start time before the
feature film actually started. A friend who saw it at a different
theater said his ordeal was a full 30 minutes!  When I complained to
the theater manager they told me the corporate office was pressuring
them because they weren't running more commercials.

This is a windfall for the theaters. They have a completely captive
audience. There is no easy way for people to avoid the commercials
because they aren't going to gamble on the length of the spots and
possibly miss the beginning of the movie, and arriving early is the
only way to guarantee a decent seat at popular showings.

Obviously this is an abuse of the vendor-customer relationship. The
second Lord of the Rings episode is 3 hours long. Can you imagine the
stress on your bladder if you have to endure an additional half hour
of unanticipated commercials on top of the 3 hour feature? Not to
mention the outrage over being subjected to that many commercials
after spending ~$20 per person for some popcorn, a soda and a seat in
the theater.

Because of this screw the customer attitude I decided not to see three
of the four new releases I had planned on seeing last month. If I have
to put up with that crap I'll just wait for them to come out on DVD and
rent them to watch on my home theater setup for a fraction of the cost 
and none of the hassle.

I wrote a letter to the theater corporate office telling them as much.
However, I'm sure they're already aware of that potential reaction.
Obviously it's in the best interests of their corporate pocketbook to
have total and complete control over viewing abilities. It's
absolutely imperative for you to have to watch the movies in a manner
under their total control. Even DVD's will eventually fall to their
greed.... already they are including commercial content in the
portions that you are not allowed to skip. But at least with a DVD you
can (currently) put it in the player and then go off to make popcorn
or do something productive while it advances to the menu.


john-

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  John, you won't get off that easily. 
They're going to put commercial messages on the DVDs also. Not thirty
minutes' worth, but a few. Those commercial messages are a nuisance,
especially after you bought a ticket to go in and watch the movie in
peace. Our local movie house here (the Independence Cinema) has four
screens. In addition to the expected images on the screen ('no smoking
allowed', 'turn off cell phones/pagers', 'enjoy *our* refreshments',
[which you bought and paid for at inflated prices]), they are now
showing blurbs for Marvin's Grocery (but not Walmart!), all the
various car dealers in Montgomery County, K-Mart, and more. Our
theatre prices are not bad however, six dollar tickets, reduced to
five dollars for afternoon matinees, etc. Where they really get you
are the three dollar little boxes of popcorn and small cokes.  PAT]

There isn't any relationship.  DTMF is "touch tone" for inband telephone

Subject: Lexmark invokes DMCA in toner suit


By Declan McCullagh
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
January 8, 2003, 7:28 PM PT

Printer maker Lexmark has found an unusual weapon to thwart rivals 
from selling replacement toner cartridges: the Digital Millennium 
Copyright Act.

A federal judge in Kentucky has scheduled a hearing for Thursday in 
the case, which Lexmark filed against Static Control Components in an 
effort to slam the brakes on the toner cartridge remanufacturing 
industry. Lexmark is the No. 2 printer maker in the United States, 
behind Hewlett-Packard, and manufactures printers under the Dell 
Computer brand.

This lawsuit is the latest of several recent DMCA cases -- both civil
and criminal -- that have tested the limits of the 1998 copyright law,
which Congress intended to limit Internet piracy. Eight movie studios
wielded it to force 2600 magazine to delete a DVD-descrambling utility
from its Web site, but the Justice Department lost a case last month
against a Russian firm that created a program that cracked Adobe's
electronic books.

Lexmark claims that Static Control violated the DMCA by selling its
Smartek chips to companies that refill toner cartridges and undercut
Lexmark's prices.

And yet if you sit down and ask the cons in the pen whether or not
they did the thing that got them put away, the VAST, VAST majority
would admit, probably sheepishly, "yeah, I did it".  Many, in fact,
boast of their dubious achievements.

The examples you cited are horrific and the perpetrators of such
corruption themselves need to spend some time unable to make phone
calls, unable to come and go as they please, and maybe get sodomized
with broomsticks.  But I contend (and I know you and I will disagree
here) that these cases are the exception, whereas you seem to contend
that they are (or at least are becoming) the rule.

Each and every man (and woman) in prison has been found guilty by a
judge and/or jury (do you have trials by judge alone in the US?  In
Canada, the accused can elect for such a trial).  It is therefore
inappropriate to assume their innocence until proven otherwise -- it
already has been proven otherwise.  We now assume their guilt -- and
thus the appropriateness of punishing them and otherwise restricting
their rights, ie: the right to make cheap phone calls -- until their
innocence is otherwise proven.  That's the way it works, that's the way
it's always worked, and until someone can devise a better system,
that's the way it's always going to work.

Corruption in the justice system is indeed A Bad Thing<tm>.  But
taking some isolated cases and using it as the foundation to argue for
cheaper phone calls for inmates is, in my opinion, way too much of a
stretch.  YMMV.

Subject: Re: Keystone Kops & Kollect Kalls


> trials by judge alone ...

Yes, we have those. A defendant can ask for (or be pressured into) a
'bench trial' in front of a judge without a jury. The vast majority 
of cases in large cities are that way. In the United States at
least, jury trials and the attornies to conduct them cost way to
much money for the 'average' defendant. Five thousand dollars is a
very cheap jury trial; ten-twenty thousand in lawyer fees is more
typical. *If you were arrested, being held in a dungeon jail on a
fifty thousand dollar bond ('merely' five thousand to get out on
bond pending trial) and have to hire a lawyer to defend yourself, 
could YOU afford to do it?*

Or would you settle for a bench trial (judge only) and a lawyer who
agreed to handle it for four or five thousand dollars?  Could you 
afford that?  Remember now, we are talking about the 90-95 percent
of the inmates awaiting trial who are young black guys (at least here
in the USA in the larger cities). 

If you cannot afford any lawyer at all (that's the idea) then you get
the public pretender -- oops I mean defender -- who is, himself/herself
an *employee* of the prosecutors office assigned to handle 'indigent'
cases. A judge has to agree to appoint a public defender, you do not
just get one automatically. And if you could somehow 'afford' to raise
the bail money to get out on bond while awaiting trial, then the court
says you can also 'afford' to hire your own attorney.

It makes things a lot easier for the system here in the United States
if they can work it assembly line style. Your first contact with
'your lawyer' (the public defender) is through the bars of the cell
in jail while waiting court. Typically overcrowded, anywhere from 30-40
other men in the same cell, and his interview/consultation lasts 2-3
minutes. When your turn comes to go in the courtroom, deputies take
you in handcuffed and stand next to you while the judge reviews the
'application' for public defender.

If the public defender is appointed  to you, then you get another 5-10
minute interview with him/her. I  have never yet met a public defender
who advised  the client  to get  a jury trial.  They *always*  say you
should settle for a bench trial and the public defender offers to talk
to  the prosecutor  and attempt  to 'resolve'  the matter.  Usually it
comes down  to 'if you  agree to a  bench trial and plead  guilty, the
state  will settle  for six  months or  a year  behind bars'  in minor
cases. If you  have the audacity to demand a jury  trial and FORCE the
state/police officers to get up  in court and testify, then the stakes
go  much higher. Expect  the state  will ask  for a  twenty/thiry year
sentence. So a smart person  usually decides (as Charles Brown, former
AT&T chairman during divestiture decided  to do) to cut his losses and
make a guilty  plea. I am talking now about  the situation in Chicago,
Cook County, Illinois but certainly in many other towns as well.

Things are *not* as you see on television, where the noble and honest
prosecutors/police officers go through these long, drawn out jury
trials.  The typical, average trial in Cook County/Chicago lasts all
of ten minutes or so. And they have three or four dozen of those on a
daily basis. Cook County Jail has an inmate population of about nine
thousand inmates daily. They do not give you the simplest courtesies
of paper, and pen to write out your case, let alone access to computer
terminals to research your defense, etc. The assumption is you are 
guilty from the get-go. After all, if you were not guilty, the noble
and honest police officers would never have brought you there, would
they?

Lexmark lawsuit seeks to defend intellectual property rights while
preserving customers' rights to choose.

    LEXINGTON, Ky., Jan. 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- As a result of a
Lexmark International, Inc. (NYSE: LXK) lawsuit against Static Control
Components, Inc., for violation of the Copyright Act and the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, the federal district court in Lexington,
Ky., issued a temporary order - agreed to by Static Control -
requiring Static Control to immediately cease making, selling, or
otherwise trafficking in the "Smartek(TM)" microchip for the toner
cartridges developed for the Lexmark T520/522 and T620/622 laser
printers.

    The order is in effect until Lexmark's motion for a preliminary
injunction is heard by the Court.

    Lexmark's complaint alleges that the Smartek(TM) microchips
incorporate infringing copies of Lexmark's copyrighted software and
are being sold by Static Control to defeat Lexmark's technological
controls, thereby allowing the unauthorized access to Lexmark's
protected software programs and the unauthorized remanufacturing of
Lexmark "Prebate(TM)" toner cartridges.

Cape Cod Real Estate Broker Sentenced to Three Years Imprisonment
for His Role in Timeshare Telemarketing Fraud Scam, Reports U.S. Attorney 

    BOSTON, Jan. 9 /PRNewswire/ --  A Cape Cod real estate broker was
sentenced today to a term of federal imprisonment for his role in defrauding
10,000 timeshare owners out of over $4.5 million.  ...

    According to the evidence presented at trial, Gonczy, Joel
Epstein, and their co-conspirators, established a complex network of
more than a dozen companies designed to persuade timeshare owners who
were interested in selling their timeshares to purchase a $399
"appraisal" of their timeshare.  The scheme passed timeshare owners
through a series of boiler rooms to complete the fraud.  First, the
defendants established a number of purported "buying companies" based
in Florida and Texas which contacted timeshare owners and made a host
of misrepresentations, including that they would buy the person's
timeshare if the owner obtained an appraisal and that they would
reimburse the owner for the appraisal fee at the time of closing. 

The buying companies falsely claimed that they received no fees from
the appraisal companies and had no part in the appraisal process.
Once the buying company persuaded the timeshare owner into selling the
timeshare, the buying company referred the timeshare owner to a
purportedly independent service, Multi-State Listing Service ("MLS"),
which in fact was a second boiler room.  The timeshare owner would be
told that the MLS would put the timeshare owner in touch with
"independent and internationally recognized" appraisal companies.

Subject: Sony Vs. Microsoft / Showdown In The Digital Rights Corral
Date: Fri, 10 Jan 2003 00:25:20 -0500


by Lisa DiCarlo

NEW YORK - Its name is decidedly unsexy, but digital rights management
will be the hottest topic in personal computing and digital
entertainment in coming years.  Sony and Microsoft are two companies
at the forefront, setting the stage for a potential clash of titans.

It took Napster, the pioneering but now defunct free music-swapping
service, to bring digital rights front of mind for the entertainment
and technology industries.  In simple terms, DRM aims to control the
distribution of digital content whether online or off.  The
implications for consumers are enormous, as is the potential revenue
stream for companies that provide digital rights technology.

The market right now is tiny--less than $100 million in 2001, the most
recent year for which figures are available--but International Data
Corp.  estimates 55% compound annual growth through 2006, or about
half a billion dollars, says IDC contributing analyst Joshua Duhl.

Yeah?  So what took them so long to do this?  You'd think if it was
simply about cash, this'd been done back when HDTV was first proposed
(1986 wasn't it?).

SDTV is still a big improvement over analog.  And as a consumer, I
couldn't give a rat's ass if a station leases bandwidth to an outside
party.  I care only about what, and how much, is on the screen in
front of me.

But as HDTV becomes more and more common, I believe the market will
decide.  If consumers really prefer HDTV-quality images over
SDTV-quality images, the TV ratings (along with responses to surveys)
will reflect that.  Broadcasters that cater to the demands of
consumers will make higher profits.  But if consumers prefer having a
choice of several SDTV channels over a single HDTV channel, again, the
broadcaster that caters to it is going to win.  It's the invisible
hand of Adam Smith in action.

I think there'll be tremendous resistance to these things -- at least,
to any scheme that obsoletes existing HDTV sets.  Resistance possibly
in the form of class-action lawsuits on the part of consumers who were
told "this set complies with the coming standard".


Then Ron Chapman added:

> Do you really, *really* believe that DTV is about quality?

Only?  No.  Primarily?  Yes.  Sorry if I sound naive to you -- I guess
I just haven't quite reached the "cynical ol' bastard" stage of my
life yet.  (Odd, because being a Limbaugh conservative I'm often
accused of just that.)

Ah, I begin to see.  Yes, it all makes sense now.  The 90% of
Americans (and I expect the numbers are similar here in Canada) that
receive their television via cable or satellite are going to
immediately disconnect those superior delivery methods in favour of
getting maybe 20 or 30 over-the-air channels.  Yes, I can see that
happening just about overnight.

(I'm not up to date on the technical side of things here: I thought I
read, some moons ago, that one HDTV channel can be partitioned into as
many as six SDTV channels -- has this been changed or do I remember it
wrong?)

I seem to recall an announcement very recently in this here Digest
saying that some agreement has been reached that will allow
manufacturers to build "cable-ready" HDTV sets that won't require any
sort of converter.  This seems to be the opposite of what the
nay-sayers here are predicting.  Granted, this comes too late for me -
I've already got my HDTV set and I'm not buying another one, nor is
there any guarantee this "standard" will also be adopted in Canada, so
it's a set-top box for me (or, in my case, a Bell Expressvu satellite
receiver).

Ironic, ain't it?  The more channels we get, the fewer eyeballs each
station gets and thus the more commercials it has to run to make up
for the revenue shortfall.  Again, though, as long as the market
(that's us) is prepared to put up with it, and don't stampede to any
broadcaster that offers an alternative, this trend will continue.  The
invisible hand strikes again.

I just got a similar two-buck increase in my satellite bill.  It's
still cheaper than the local cable provider -- then again, it's given
me thoughts of dusting off my ol' grey-market DirecTV receiver and
looking around to see if I can find somebody with "connections" to
smart card codes.  ;-)

> I do get tired of the commercial channels charging the cable companies

I will rush to the first provider -- cable, satellite, whatever --
that realizes that no matter how many channels they stuff into a
package, I can only watch ONE AT A TIME.  If I have the basic 100 or
so channels, I pay about $20 per month.  For the package I'm on (over
240 channels), it's $40 per month.  I CAN STILL ONLY WATCH ONE AT A
TIME.  I should be charged the same rate for TV viewing no matter how
many choices are on the menu.  I don't expect to pay twice as much for
food when I vacation in the US and stop at a Jack In The Box, just
because they've got twice as many items on the menu as McDonald's
does.  (Then again, I'd be willing to pay a premium at JITB for the
simple reason that, unlike McDonald's, their food doesn't taste like
boiled masking tape).

We're moving into a digital age.  I'd love it if some provider
realized that they could TRACK my viewing habits and direct pro-rated
portions of my monthly fees to the stations that I ACTUALLY WATCH -
and give sweet bugger all to the ones I shun.  I'd switch VERY quickly
to such a provider - but, until Adam Smith's hand moves in that
direction, I'm SOL.  (That's "Short On Luck", for those easily
offended)

There's lots of technology to play these movies back on real TV's, not
just tiny computer screens.  The experience would be the same as
watching the original broadcasts or DVDs.

It seems that the entertainment industry has always been paranoid
about new technologies.  In the 40's and 50's the film industry
worried that television would erode their audience, in the 70's they
fought against VCRs, and in the past few years the music industry has
been battling against Napster-style services.  Yet in the end, they
eventually embrace the technologies and learn how to turn them around
to make money (many movies make more for the studios in video sales
than they do in the theatres).

What I think causes this behavior is that it takes them a while to
figure out *how* to make money off the technology (unless it fits
easily into an established infrastructure, e.g. DVD rental/sales at
video stores).  While they're working it out, they don't want to lose
control of their product to outsiders.

You've never seen an industry treat its own customer like potential
criminals?  You've never been in the DTP industry, then, where Quark
treats its paid customers as if they were ACTUAL criminals.  Quark has
even come out and said as much, publicly.

John, you need to get out more -- or else stop making blanket

I was running a security port scan against one of my servers from the
laptop which is on the PCS wireless network of SPRINT aka PCS. After
the scan was complete, something in their infrastructure continued to
scan for a full 15 minutes (I was talking to an associate who was
watching the scan on the scanned machine).

We were amazed. At first we thought some nefarious process on my
laptop. I yanked the Merlin card and the scans continued for another
13 minutes with the source IP that had been assigned to my laptop.

What the hell are they doing at SPRINT????

As an aside, SPRINT compresses every image and if one bops to a few
dozen sites with a lot of images, the connection slows to a
crawl. Something is not scaling but again, what the hack are they
doing over there? They appear to continue compressing images from a
site as long as one's IP is active rather than as long as the HTTP
connection persists. This does not make sense to me ...

Do folks know their copyrighted images are being compressed by this

First, downloading ten GB of DVD-quality video is not a trivial
matter, even with a broadband connection. Second, even the cheapest
way of storing that much data (a burnable DVD) begins to swamp the
cost of just buying the studio's commercial DVD. Third, last I
checked, there is a considerable difference between watching a movie
on any home video screen and a giant theater screen.

As far as studios being paranoid about new technologies because they
don't know how to make money from them, that is right on the mark.

Are you bragging or complaining? I'm not quite sure what your point is
here. Are you saying that your lack of interest should apply to
everyone? Do you download movies illegally, instead?

No, I said that I have never seen an industry do it like the
entertainment industry does. I stand by that statement. Hollywood and
the RIAA have come out many times and accused patrons of being
criminals. There have been notable actions such as the Betamax case,
issues surrounding taping off the air, and the current MP3 debate, to
name just a few. That's not to mention the flap over the DVD
encryption as it pertains to non-approved players. In sum, the
entertainment industry's attacks on its customers makes any action by
Quark pale in comparison.

I get out plenty and my comparison was not a blanket statement. It was a 
valid comparison, which you failed to refute. Being in the entertainment 
industry myself, I think I know how big its world is.

- New Nokia 3560 and 3520 Phones Bring Color Displays and Java Technology To
                           TDMA Customers -

    LAS VEGAS, Jan. 9 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Nokia (NYSE:NOK) today
announced the world's first TDMA handsets with full-color displays,
continuing a tradition of Nokia firsts in the TDMA market, including
the world's first dual mode IS-136 TDMA/AMPS handset, the Nokia 2160
phone, and the world's first GAIT compliant TDMA/GSM/AMPS phone, the
Nokia 6340 handset.  With features such as Java capability, custom
color wallpapers, MIDI ring tunes and two-way text messaging with
e-mail support, the color-screen Nokia 3560 and 3520 phones allow TDMA
operators to offer many of today's most-wanted features on their
existing networks.  

Shipments are expected to begin during the second
quarter of 2003.  With support for MIDP 1.0 Java technology, the
dual-mode Nokia 3520 phone (TDMA 800MHz/AMPS) and the tri-mode Nokia
3560 phone (TDMA 800MHz/1900MHz/AMPS) allow users to customize their
phones by downloading new applications, such as games or productivity
applications, to their phones using the built-in WAP 2.0 mobile
Internet browser.  Nokia 3520 and 3560 phone owners can also use the
mobile Internet browser to further customize their handsets by
downloading new multi-channel MIDI polyphonic ring tunes to
personalize their call alerts and SMS notification sounds.

Subject: Sony Vs. Microsoft / The Fight For Interactive Television


Victoria Murphy

NEW YORK - Whatever the programming they deliver, the entertainment
devices of the future -- souped-up set-top boxes, interactive
televisions, PCs that talk to TVs and vice versa -- will all have two
elements: software and hardware.

Microsoft is the software giant, but has had little success selling
hardware. Sony is the leading TV manufacturer and one of the top five
makers of VCRs, but has traditionally relied on others for the
software that fills its boxes. Now each is trying to elbow the other
out of the race to persuade consumers to pay more to set up custom
programming, download movies or store family photos. Shouldn't they
just agree to work together?

Subject: California Disclosure Law Has National Reach


By Kevin Poulsen, SecurityFocus Jan 6 2003 4:38PM

A new California law requiring companies to notify their customers of 
computer security breaches applies to any online business that counts 
Californians as customers, even if the company isn't based in the 
Golden State.

So warned Scott Pink, deputy chair of the American Bar Association's 
Cybersecurity Task Force, in a conference call Monday organized by an 
industry trade group and attended by approximately 50 representatives 
of technology companies and law firms concerned about the scope of 
the new law, which will take effect on July 1st of this year.

Subject: FCC's Powell Calls TiVo 'God's Machine'


The chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is a new 
convert - to the personal digital video recorder faithful.

"My favorite product that I got for Christmas is TiVo," FCC chairman 
Michael Powell said during a question and answer session at the 
International Consumer Electronics Show. "TiVo is God's machine."

If Powell's enthusiasm for digital recordings of TV broadcasts are 
reflected in FCC rulings, the entertainment industry could find it 
difficult to push in Washington its agenda for technical restrictions 
on making and sharing such recordings.

Powell said he intended to use the TiVo machine to record TV shows to 
play on other television sets in his home, and even suggested that he 
might share recordings with his sister if she were to miss a favorite 
show.

As I recall, the breakup wasn't specifically designed to break the 'baby
Bell' ILECs' dominance of local phone service, but rather to separate the
regulated monopoly operations (the ILECs) from the operation that wanted to
compete in unregulated markets (specifically, computers.)

I already posted this to a completely separate forum, but couldn't
resist it here too:

   ==========================================================

Here's another one to try; tho it takes some preparation and
dedication beforehand; but I've got that part sewn up:

Speak Ubby-Dubby to the telemarketers!

I first became aware of this 'language' watching the kid's TV show
"ZOOM" back in the 70's; In Ubby Dubby, each vowel is preceded by
"ubb":

Hubbere ubbis subbome Ubbubbubby Dubbubbubby. 

So 'hello' becomes 'hubellubo' ; Uband nubow thubis; 
   
Hubappuby Bubirthdubay tubo yubou,
Hubappuby Bubirthdubay tubo yubou,
Hubappuby Bubirthdubay dubear Frubiend,
Hubappuby Bubirthdubay tubo yubou!

It's easy enough to start to learn to translate the simple words you
hear, like "Hub-i" and "Hub-ow", but anything longer than 2 syllables
to begin with becomes hopelessly complicated for the mind to work on
with any speed.

Fortunately, my teenage daughter has managed to become fluent enough
in ubby-dubby; next time we get a telemarketer calling in the evening,
we're gonna put her on as the 'lady of the house'.  She can put us on
the floor in short order when she starts doing it; It should reduce
the most sensitive telemarketers (oxymoron?) to tears; it'll probably
bring out the beast in the strong ones!

"Ubb-oh!! Thubbanks fubbor cubballubbing!! Ubb-I've bubbeen
wubbantubbing yubbour prubbodubbect/subbervubbice fubbor subbome
tubbime, nubbow!!"

So, find a teenager who loves a challenge and has a bit of mean
streak, and let 'em go to town!

Here's a translator, to help you get along:

Verizon just installed a Quest T1 circuit at my house and I now need
to extend the line into the house.  I have never done this with a T1
line before and could use some help.

At the outside demarc, there are 4 sets of 4 terminal posts.  Each set
has a Yellow, Black, Red & Green wire from a jumper cable connected to
it.  The jumper cables are plugged into what looks like a RJ45 jack in
the demarc.  The verizon label says that Circuit 1 is the line, and no
other circuits are labeled.

I need to know how to connect to these terminal posts and whith what
wires.  I am planning to use standard CAT5 UTP to extend the circuit. 
I know that I will need to wire up pins 1 & 2 for one pair and 4& 5
for another at the plug, but I am not exactly sure how the CAT5 color
codes should line up with the Yellow, Black, Red, & Green at the
posts.

Thanks for any help.

Yes, that lasted about six months ... just like all the other failed
ventures the ILECs tried to pull off after 1984. Let's see: we had
"phone stores" and "computer stores" and "cellular stores" and a
number of other schemes that fell flat on their faces.

Somewhere along the line, well after divestiture, someone decided that
"local phone service" was not really a natural monopoly after all and
the CLECs were born. The ILECs have been fighting that tooth and nail,
both before and after the Communications Act of 1996, which contained
rules to govern the new competition. The ILECs have declared that they
cannot possibly live with those rules, even though they helped write
them.

If you have a T1, you should have a smartjack placed somewhere beyond
the demarc. The smartjack is usually placed inside the building, but
can be outside. The smartjack will have a few lights, to indicate
circuit status, and an RJ45 jack for you to connect to.

Hello Bill,

The The last part of your question is the easiest, I am not familiar
with the terminal block arrangment that Verizon provided.

The Cat 5 wire can be wires White/Blue to Green.  The Blue/White to Red, 
the White/orange to the black, the orange white to the yellow.  

Will you be terminating to terminal posts or modular plug?  There is a
difference between DS-1 as opposed to DSX and T-1.  I am more familiar
with DSX and T-1.  I will have to go look-up my cheat sheet
references.

Bill,

I believe that you will want to wire your extended demarc this way to
provide yourself with what I would call a 568B or rj48C jack near your
equipment:


telco incoming ---->---->---->----> jack at equipment


black ----- white/orange ----- T2 ----- 1
                                         |- customer receive
yellow ---- orange/white ----- R2 ----- 2

            white/green --------------- 3

red ------- blue/white ------- R1 ----- 4
                                         |- customer transmit
green ----- white/blue ------- T1 ----- 5

            green/white --------------- 6

            white/brown --------------- 7

            brown/white --------------- 8


At this jack you would use a straight through cable to
you equipment.

We know that you have a hard time seeing things outside your world,

I, on the other hand, can't see buying anything like that.  My point

John, you truly need to understand that there's a HUGE world outside

Quark is worse than the entertainment industry with regard to treating

Now, unless you can counter either of those facts with actual facts of

Minor correction -- the FCC ruling was that a PC with a fax modem is
considered a fax machine, for purposes of 47 USC 227, and the
corresponding CFRs, when, and *ONLY*WHEN* it is being used for
faxsimile communications.  Specifically, it is -not- a "fax machine"
when it is being used for other purposes, including "data"
communications, e.g. connecting to your ISP for e-mail..

It would be eFax, if anybody.  They are the owner of the telephone
line, and the equipment.

There *IS* another problem too, because to qualify as a fax machine
under the statute, the equipment must have the capability to
"transcribe text or images ... onto paper."  Absent a 'print'
capability, it's not a "legal" fax machine.

A close reading of the statute seems, to me, to imply that the "print"
capability needs to be 'real-time', *not* after-the-fact.  This from
"transcribe ... from an electronic signal received over a phone line
onto paper". Arguably_, if you can *only* print from a file stored on
disk, the statutory requirement is not satisfied.

Tokelau has only been connected for a few years, through satellite
systems that New Zealand funded.  It's a dependency of New Zealand.

The item of interest here is that ATT long distance will not allow one
to dial Tokelau, and, according to the information operator, claims it
doesn't exist.  It does exist, and according to the manager of the
telephone system there, the US is the only place that doesn't allow
direct calls to Tokelau.

After complaints to the FCC, and the California PUC, I find that,
while ATT doesn't admit the existence of the country, MCI does.  The
representative from ATT said that "MCI owns the lines" and ATT has no
access to them.  This last sounds bogus to me, and I am hoping that
people have more information about the reality.


73, doug
who is not, after all, going to Tokelau this spring.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  Had ATT said in effect 'the cables and
lines to that point are controlled by New Zealand (or some other national
telecom authority) and USA phones are only permitted to use it for X
hours on X days of the week' I could sort of find that an acceptable 
story. After all, that's how it was for many, many years when USA phones
attempted to call certain point in northern and central Africa. For
hisotrical reasons, many of those countries (in Africa) had been French
possessions; their telecom cables were controlled by the French telecom
department; cables were limited and in short supply; and all incoming/
outgoing calls to those points were handled by the overseas operators
in Paris. It was very common -- even until in the 1960-70's -- to attempt 
to make a call to -- let's say, Stanleyville in Congo, or some point
in the Sahara Desert area and have the Overseas operator in Paris tell
White Plains, NY (your overseas operator) something like, 'I can book
your call for next Tuesday at 9 AM, will that be okay?'. And you, the
end user either cooled your heels until next Tuesday at 9 AM, or you
could say forget it and disconnect. And if you chose to accept the
'booking' then when your phone rang next Tuesday at 2 AM USA time, 
better take the call; the French-speaking operator would not call back
to reach you over and over again. It did 'improve' a little over the
years; instead of White Plains, NY ringing over there and letting it
ring fifty or a hundred times *before* gay Paree would answer and 
put your call through, AT&T switched the IOC (international operating
center to Pittsburgh, PA) and the French people switched to an 
automated operator who would answer like this:

(in a very crisp British English male-speaking voice), "You have reached
Tel-eee-com. All international positions are engaged right now. Please
hold, your call will receive response as soon as possible." That three
or four second recorded message was followed by ten seconds or so of
bouncy music, then the entire thing would repeat. Three or four seconds
of the message again, the music again, etc. Three or four of those
recitations every minute; for five, ten or even fifteen minutes. Over 
and over. Eventually, the recording would stop and a voice cut in on
the line saying 'oui?'  and your call proceeded. When the operator in
France discovered (usually early on) that the racially diverse operator
in Pittsburgh very likely could not speak French, then she would
change to English. If you had your booking ticket number, then the
call could proceed. If not, then move to the back of the line and we
will try you again next week. French Telecom did not have a lot of
love lost for AT&T, I don't think, and considering how short they were
on lines to Africa, anyone could use them except AT&T customers (which
in those days meant *any* USA caller.)

A friend of mine (a bit older) was in Cuba back in the 1950s prior to
the embargo. *He* tried to call Chicago one day when calls had to
go through the AT&T overseas operator in Miami. He asked for the
Chicago number; Havana attempted to reach Miami AT&T, it rang for 
about ten minutes, finally she told him "I am sorry sir, the United
States is not answering the telephone today ... (!)" 

*Be careful* about *anything* an AT&T representative tells you regards
international calls. Like yourself, I think 'MCI owns the lines' sounds
like a pretty lame excuse. We know all about AT&T and lame excuses, or
downright lies. Try being in an inner city neighborhood in Chicago for
example, and use a payphone and a AT&T calling card to call to Israel
or Nigera. Depending on the operator you get handling the call, you 
will be told any number of excuses, ranging from 'your calling card
seems not to work' to 'Israel does not accept AT&T calling cards.'
(and that, mind you, despite the fact that you are placing a PAID
call to that country.) They'll tell you everything except the truth:
our corporate security policies do not permit calling card calls from
payphones in X neighborhood to Y country. Usually 'X' is a black or
otherwise minority/third-world inner city neigborhood and 'Y' is a 
country where English is not the predominant language. In other words,
anywhere AT&T percieves they will have a problem collecting the bill,
either from you or the recipient. 

Go back to the FCC complaint department and tell then you are not
satisfied with that answer that AT&T bluffed them with.   PAT]

Subject: Microsoft Resolves Class-Action Suit


By Declan McCullagh
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

Update: Microsoft said late Friday that it has settled a California 
class-action lawsuit for up to $1.1 billion, a move that would end 
the largest suit of the kind against the giant software company.

The settlement, which arose from claims that Microsoft unlawfully 
wielded its Windows monopoly to overcharge consumers for the 
operating system, allows individuals and businesses in California who 
bought Microsoft products during a five-year period to apply for 
vouchers with values of $5 to $29. The vouchers can be used to buy 
most hardware or software products from any manufacturer.

Although the maximum value of the settlement is $1.1 billion, 
Microsoft could end up paying as little as $367 million in cash to 
California public schools. If all vouchers are claimed, Microsoft 
pays the maximum.

The payout depends on how many customers make claims.

Subject: When the Athlete's Heart Falters, a Monitor Dials for Help


By ANNE EISENBERG

THE American Heart Association advises people to dial 911 at the 
first warning signs of a heart attack. "The faster you get help," one 
of its ads says, "the better your chances of survival and complete 
recovery."

Soon, machines may be able to do some of this emergency dialing on 
their own. Manufacturers are working on wearable heart monitors 
linked to cellphones that can sound an alert automatically, 
contacting a doctor, family member or Web site when trouble beckons.

Some of the monitoring devices keep track of heart rate, so in the 
future, for instance, a cellphone tucked into a runner's pocket could 
call a doctor if the runner's heart rate exceeded a preset limit. 
Another system collects more extensive electrocardiogram data and 
sends the information by cellphone to a Web site or pager.

Monitoring systems like these might be useful one day not only for 
emergency alerts, but also for the remote collection of more benign 
information: statistics on the performance of members of a cycling 
team, for example, or the heart rates of dozens of people enrolled in 
clinical trials.

Subject: So Near Yet So Far: A Cellphone Roamer in Latin Lands


By SIMON ROMERO

A BREEZE of dry tropical heat greeted me after my plane touched down 
in Braslia, a futuristic capital of wide avenues and sprawling 
concrete monuments. Then my American cellphone rang. It was my editor 
calling from New York with a few questions.

I later marveled at how easily I was reached by someone dialing a New 
York phone number. The crystal-clear quality of the service I used 
was delightfully deceptive, Braslia's remoteness notwithstanding.

If only international roaming was always so easy in the developing 
world. Unfortunately, judging from my own recent experience, roaming 
has a way to go before carriers in the United States and Europe can 
confidently market worldwide roaming capabilities to their customers.

Most large American wireless companies offer some sort of roaming 
abroad, but only one, T-Mobile (formerly VoiceStream), a unit of 
Deutsche Telekom, has aggressively started to advertise such a 
service. But the international roaming offered by carriers in Europe 
and much of Asia is more advanced because they adhere to a single 
wireless standard, the global system for mobile communications, or 
GSM.

The wireless industry in the United States developed differently, 
with a variety of standards allowed to compete: code division 
multiple access, or CDMA; time division multiple access, or TDMA; 
Nextel's iDEN and, increasingly, GSM.

Latin America's wireless industry has been influenced by American 
carriers that invested heavily in the region, resulting in a similar 
mixture of standards. So when I recently traveled to Mexico and 
Brazil I took two phones capable of roaming in both countries, a TDMA 
phone from Cingular and an iDEN phone from Nextel.

Subject: Gadget Takes iTunes to the Living Room


By Ian Fried
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

SAN FRANCISCO--Many Macintosh fans have been hoping Apple Computer
would introduce a device that would allow music stored on a Mac in the
den to be played on a home stereo in the living room.

Such a device did debut at this week's Macworld Expo, but it didn't
come from Apple. One had to walk well past the massive Apple booth,
past even the massage chairs and a memory reseller, to find the new
gadget, which is dubbed the HomePod wireless stereo.

 ...

The device, which resembles a wireless base station with a couple of 
added buttons and a small LCD (liquid-crystal display) screen, uses a 
built-in wireless networking technology called Wi-Fi to connect to a 
wireless-equipped Macintosh or PC. A small Java program on the 
computer scours the PC or Mac for music and sends that information to 
the HomePod. The device can even receive playlists created with 
iTunes digital music software. The HomePod downloads songs one at a 
time and plays them either through a stereo or by connecting directly 
to speakers. The back of the HomePod has a FireWire port, allowing it 
to connect directly to a hard drive, and, perhaps at some point, to 
Apple's iPod digital music player.

Subject: Officials Say Troops Risk Identity Theft After Burglary


By ADAM CLYMER

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 - Thousands of military personnel facing 
deployment for a possible war with Iraq are also confronting a threat 
on the home front -- the risk of identity theft after burglars stole 
computerized records from a health care company in Phoenix last month.

The names, addresses, telephone numbers, birth dates and Social
Security numbers of about 562,000 troops, dependents and retirees were
on laptops and computer hard drives stolen from a nondescript building
in an industrial park on Dec. 14, company officials said.  Some
medical claim records for people on active duty were also stolen from
the company, TriWest Healthcare Alliance.

Even without the medical records, the information stolen is enough for
criminals to use in creating false identities. TriWest, a Pentagon
contractor handling medical claims for military personnel and
dependents, warned the 562,000 customers in 16 Mountain and Western
states that their identities might be stolen. It also posted a
$100,000 reward.

TriWest advised the potential victims, of whom 183,000 are on active
duty, to ask for free credit reports and flag their credit records.
Within about 10 days, said David J. McIntyre Jr., the company's
president, customers will only have to notify TriWest that they want
this done, and TriWest will take care of the details.

Thus far, TriWest and the federal authorities say, none of those whose
records were stolen have had their identities stolen. But Betsy
Broder, an identity theft expert at the Federal Trade Commission,
warned that it often takes weeks or months for such thefts to become
apparent.

Subject: MPEG-4 Backers Protest Microsoft License


By Stefanie Olsen
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

Proponents of MPEG-4 are decrying Microsoft's new licensing fees for
rival technology, saying that the pricing poses unfair competition and
threatens consumer choice.

In a first-ever move for Microsoft, it set pricing this week for
licensing of its audio and video compression technology, or codecs,
for use on non-Windows operating systems. The company says it will
charge 10 cents per decoder, 20 cents per encoder, and 25 cents for
both.

In comparison, MPEG LA -- a consortium of companies holding patents
attached to implementations of the MPEG-4 standard -- charges 25 cents
per encoder and decoder, or 50 cents for both -- a fee structure
finalized in November. MPEG-4 is an emerging standard for the delivery
of digital media on PCs, DVDs and consumer electronics.

By undercutting the price, critics say, Microsoft is threatening the
industry's natural tendency to migrate to open standards that allow
many companies to work together seamlessly to service mass media with
better choice. MPEG-2, for example, MPEG-4's predecessor, is the
standard currently used by most digital cable providers and DVD
manufacturers.

Subject: For Verizon, no Baby Steps


Telecom giant nimbly rides convergence wave, towering above its Baby 
Bell Siblings

By Peter J. Howe, Globe Staff, 1/12/2003

Back in the mid-1990s, as multiple revolutions began to sweep through
the telecommunications industry, not many people would have predicted
that the old-line Bell System heirs then known by such names as New
England Telephone and New Jersey Bell would by now emerge as the king
of the hill.

Today's Verizon Communications was supposed to be one of the doddering
dinosaurs flattened by emerging wireless and Internet carriers and a
wave of nimble start-ups spawned by the landmark 1996 federal
Telecommunications Act.

It turns out Verizon has managed to not only ride but dominate the
wave. Wall Street now values Verizon at $109.8 billion as of Friday's
stock market close, well more than the stripped down AT&T Corp.,
BellSouth, Sprint, Qwest, now-bankrupt MCI WorldCom, and a half-dozen
surviving landline competitors combined.

Along with the other Bells, Verizon's stock has jumped by nearly 50
percent from lows this summer, getting an extra bump last week from
President Bush's proposal to end taxes on stock dividends, which phone
companies generally offer.

Subject: Where Hi-Fi Meets Wi-Fi: A Wireless Music System


By ROY FURCHGOTT

The big hurdle to wiring a home stereo system to play music in every
room is the wiring. But today, Yamaha will unveil a server that can
provide music wirelessly to as many as five locations at a distance of
150 feet.

Called MusicCast, the system is essentially a server with an
80-gigabyte hard drive and a built-in CD-R drive, which can load up to
1,000 CD's compressed as MP3's or 120 uncompressed CD's into an
onboard music library. The server can also play music from external
sources like a CD, tape or record player, or a computer connected to
the Internet.

Subject: Start-up Marries Blogs and Camera Phones


A Dublin-based start-up is to offer software to mobile operators that 
will enable mobile phone users to create and maintain Weblogs or 
"blogs" using only their phones.

NewBay Software, a privately funded company headed by former 
Baltimore Technologies executive Paddy Holahan, is aiming to 
capitalise on the explosive growth in weblogs over the past year. It 
is estimated that over 500,000 have been created over the past 18 
months and are now starting up at the rate of about 5,000 daily.

The content of Weblogs can range from personal diaries and opinion 
sites to amateur publishing on sports, politics, events and reviews. 
Weblogs are created using PCs and blogging software that is available 
both commercially and for free over the Internet.

NewBay Software is hoping to capitalise on the ubiquity of mobile 
phones and particularly the MMS capabilities of the latest generation 
of camera phones to market its FoneBlog software product. Using 
FoneBlog, network operators provide Web addresses for customers who 
can then update their personal Web sites by sending text and images 
from their phone. If the user's phone does not have MMS, a text only 
site can be created.

The magazine acknowledges that cell phones are radios and there will
always be some intrinsic problems, but then points out the very real
concern that phones locked onto one system -- either through
programming or through technical limitations -- often won't kick over
to a good signal on an alternate carrier. Oh, and that in many cases
(depending on the phone and network) that's an FCC violation.

"In Steuben County [NY], we made 14 test calls on 12 different phones
with accounts from Sprint and Verizon. In Sullivan County, we made 7
test calls on 6 phones with accounts from AT&T and Cingular. Overall,
of the 18 phone-and-service combinations tested, 9 calls failed to
connect to 911.  In every instance, there was a strong signal from
another carrier the phones could have used. "

I will note a comment by an expert who testifies and files a lot of
briefs for plaintiffs in TCPA and related actions.  He says that
courts have held that under the law, e-fax, PDAs, fax-to-email,
etc. are fax machines.  Since I don't have permission to quote the

the fruits of his and of a number of other legal minds are available

There are reports that numbers in the +690 range are to be used for
Telesleaze (900 bypass): and given how _few_ real telephone numbers
(less than 3000) there are likely to be in Tokelau, the majority of
calls to +690 would statistically be then likely to be Telesleaze.

AT&T may well be protecting themselves against claims of fraud -- and,
given the unusual way that Telcos do settlements for this type of call,
although AT&T could carry and hand over the call there would be little
profit for them in doing so, and therefore equally little incentive!


Richard Cox

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: If both Tokelau *and* Telesleaze are
assigned to use 690, whose fault is that?  AT&T plays a big role in
both international number assignments (working through ITU) and 
Telesleaze number assignments, don't they?  There should *never* be
a country -- no matter how small it is -- on the same number, or
else the Telesleaze should somehow be restricted. On the other side
of the coin however, no one at AT&T seemed to complain very much when
the country code for Guyana was hijacked and used for that gay sex
thing AT&T was partnered on for a couple years.  PAT]

It's an RJ45 jack, but what is the correct name for the cable assembly?

I've always had my smartjacks right next to the equipment rack and
been able to use a short Cat5 patch cord, but I have no idea if that
would work if it had to be 100 feet long.

What are the pinouts, and for that matter what is the distance limit

Subject: Illinois Death Row is Empty Today


In a *very courageous* move on Saturday, Illinois governor Jim Ryan
totally vacated the state's 'death row', saying that there were too
many inconsistencies and problems with the way in which the prisoners
got there. All the inmates were commuted to much lesser sentences;
four (that makes about 12 in total) were totally pardoned as a result
of police/prosecutor misconduct in their trials. A few of the more than
108 residents of death row were commuted to life in prison. A few others
were commuted to 40 year sentences. 

Mr. Ryan began his speech to the people of Illinois (which lasted over
an hour) by thanking Northwestern University and the students in its
Journalism School for their diligence in investigating those cases,
and bringing them to his attention. He also thanked the Chicago
Tribune staff for its reporting. He then apologized to the victims of
the crimes and their families, saying they had been victimized twice,
once by the 'original crime' then a second time by police and
prosecutors who 'did not give a damn about them; only get they could,
and wherever they could get them.' 

"It is really ugly when innocent victims and their families are preyed
upon twice; once by a rapist/murderer/serial killer, then again by the
police/prosecutors and their staffs who the people assumed would protect
them." Governor Ryan had very little good to say about police and
prosecutors in Illinois, noting that 'this sort of thing seems to
happen all too frequently.'  He then named each of the men who were on
death row, and briefly told the circumstances of each case. 

Four of the men, who were mentally challenged had claimed that police
had coerced 'confessions' from them with various promises. They were
all found to have rock-solid alabies police had chosen to ignore in 
their haste to get a conviction. Two of the four also had been
represented by public defenders who had 'encouraged' them to confess
and get 'deals' cut for them by prosecutors. They were pardoned
entirely straight from death row; their families/friends went to the
prison on Saturday to retrieve them. Two of the men were met by
Salvation Army representatives who promised to help them get restarted
in life. (One of these latest inmates had been on death row seven
years after 9-10 years in prison.) With these four men, newly released
DNA tests showed they had nothing to do with the crime for which they
were charged at all. 

Quite a few of the now-former death row inmates had 'inconclusive
evidence' about the exact roles they had played, and in most of those
cases there had been 'co-conspirators' who had snitched on their
partners in an effort to 'cut a deal' and save themselves from death.
Where the prosecutors had 'taken the deal' and given them shorter
terms in prison, Governor Ryan matched it with commutations for the
death row guys, giving them the same sentences; often times 40 years
instead of death which the prosecutors had asked for, occassionally
less. Whatever the co-conspirators got, they got also. 

Police around Chicago area are today gunning for the governor, to say
the least. They hate him. Police do not like DNA testing either,
except when the results go the way they want.

of foreign investment restrictions in the telecom industry on January
27 (see Telecom Update #359). To participate, contact the Clerk of the
House of Commons "at the earliest opportunity."

MICROCELL CUTS BACK BUSINESS SALES: A January 6 SEC filing from
Microcell Telecommunications reveals that its recovery plan includes
cutting back on efforts to sell business accounts, wholesale services,
and wireless data. The company, which is currently operating under
bankruptcy protection, will focus on consumer PCS voice services.

** Microcell predicts its service revenues will grow from
    $561 million to over $1 billion in five years, and that
    only 3% of its 2008 revenue will be from data.

SASKTEL SEEKS HIGHER BUSINESS RATES: SaskTel has applied to the CRTC
to increase rates for business local service by up to 10% in all
locations outside Regina, Saskatoon, Yorkton, Swift Current, Moose
Jaw, Estevan, Weyburn, Prince Albert, and North Battleford, and to
raise optional SmartTouch rates for all customers. SaskTel has
requested February approval for the new rates.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/8740/eng/2003/s22.htm#40

CALL-NET SAYS TELUS VIOLATING BUNDLING RULES: Call-Net claims that
Telus is providing untariffed bundled services to at least five
customers: BC Ferries, Crystal Glass, Indigo, Insurance Corp of BC,
and Petro Canada. Call-Net wants the CRTC to order Telus to file full
information on these services and any other bundles, and to allow
Call-Net to prosecute Telus for violating section 25 of the Telecom
Act.

360NETWORKS SUES TO RECOVER PAYMENTS TO NORTEL: The U.S. wing of
360networks has sued Nortel Networks to recover US$101 million it paid
Nortel in the 90 days before it filed for bankruptcy. Under U.S. law,
pre-bankruptcy payments can in some cases be recovered for
distribution to all creditors.

QUEBECOR SEEKS CABINET REVIEW OF EXPRESSVU: Quebecor CEO Pierre Karl
Peladeau says he has asked the federal Cabinet to hold a public
inquiry into BCE's ownership of Bell ExpressVu.  Peladeau argues that
the satellite broadcaster has an unfair advantage over Quebecor-owned
Videotron because it is subsidized from Bell Canada's profits. (See
Telecom Update #353)

VIDEOTRON, RDS SETTLE DISPUTE: The CRTC has cancelled this week's
hearing into a royalty dispute between Quebecor Media and RDS. CTV's
French-language sports channel says it has reached agreement with
Videotron on overdue and future fees.  (See Telecom Update #361)

ALIANT COMPANY CUTS JOBS: Saint John-based Xwave, Aliant's IT services
unit, laid off 87 employees January 10, after cutting 101 jobs since
October. Xwave now has 2,500 employees.

CYGNAL TO LAY FIBRE FOR PEEL SCHOOLS: Hydro One Telecom has granted
Cygnal Technologies a $3.6 million contract to build a 1 Gbps fibre
optic network linking 110 public and separate schools in Peel Region
west of Toronto. (See Telecom Update #338)

ROGERS AT&T ADDS 150,000 SUBSCRIBERS: Rogers AT&T Wireless added a net
146,800 subscribers in the fourth quarter, 19% fewer than a year
ago. Postpaid net additions rose 66%; prepaid additions declined
78%. Postpaid monthly churn fell to 2.1%.

** Rogers Communications added a net 45,000 Internet
    subscribers in the quarter, 20% fewer than a year ago. It
    also added 9,400 cable subscribers, but expects to lose up
    to 1% of cable customers during the coming year.

TELUS AND TWU EXTEND TALKS: On the recommendation of federal
conciliators, Telus Corp and the Telecommunications Workers Union have
agreed to extend efforts to reach a new contract beyond the January 13
deadline. Conciliators plan 20 to 30 more meetings, followed by a new
60-day conciliation period.

GT RESTRUCTURING APPROVED IN U.S.: On January 2, a U.S. court approved
the plan to reorganize Group Telecom previously accepted by the
Ontario Superior Court. (See Telecom Update #364)

NORTHERN TEL STATUS CHALLENGED: O.N.Telcom has asked the CRTC to
require Northern Telephone to comply with the ILEC- affiliate
procedures in Decision 2002-76 (see Telecom Update #362), saying the
company is "not only under the common control of Bell Canada, but
 ... is now so inextricably integrated with Telebec as to be one
company."

FIXED WIRELESS SOLD FOR LOCAL PHONE SERVICE: Montreal-based SR Telecom
says it has sold fixed wireless systems to Bell Canada and
Northwestel, to provide local voice and data services in remote
communities.

CANADIAN SOFTWARE MERGERS STILL LOW: The Canadian Advanced Technology
Alliance reports that the value of mergers and acquisitions in the
Canadian software and computer services industry in 2002 was $1.7
billion, down 15% from 2001 and down 85% from 2000.

Telecommunications Consultants Association has issued a Call for
Speakers for its Spring Conference, scheduled for April 3-5 in
Montreal. Submissions are due by January 17.

BCE SHUFFLES BOARD: BCE has added three new directors: Andre Berard
(Chair, National Bank), Edward Lumley (Vice-Chair, BMO Nesbitt Burns),
and Thomas Burns (former Chair, PwC Consulting). Two directors, Edward
Newall (Nova Chemicals) and Guy Saint-Pierre (Royal Bank), will leave
the Board in May, reducing the number of BCE directors linked to Royal
Bank from four to two.

PRICE CAPS EXPLAINED: The CRTC's 2002 decision on price cap regulation
continues to arouse heated discussion and has been appealed to
Cabinet. Lis Angus's analysis of this decision is now posted in the
Reports and Tutorials section of the Angus website.

Subject: Hotmail: A Spammer's Paradise?


By Michelle Delio
02:00 AM Jan. 09, 2003 PT

If so many spam offers weren't totally bogus, Hotmail users would be
incredibly well-endowed, slim people with plenty of hair who make big
money working at home when they aren't having great sex provoked by
free porn and herbal Viagra.

Many users of the free e-mail service offered by Microsoft's MSN.com 
say that within a day of creating a new Hotmail account the spam 
starts flowing in, almost as if spammers have sunk a tap directly 
into Hotmail's user database and are slurping up a free-flowing 
torrent of e-mail addresses.

And according to Steve Linford, of the anti-spam Spamhaus Project, 
that's almost exactly what's happening.

Spamhaus has proof that at least one spammer has been conducting a
massive dictionary attack against the mail servers of both Hotmail.com
and MSN.com, at the rate of three to four tries per second, 24 hours a
day, continuously for the last five months.


http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,57132,00.html


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: The same thing happens at AOL. I have
used my *legimate* AOL account to establish new screen names, and
within <seconds> the first spam started arriving. I know all about
'dictionary style attacks', etc. None the less, I really do not think
spammers even with dictionary programs could get in there and work it
that fast without some help from AOL.  PAT]

Fault?  As with all the other countries whose numbering ranges have
been partially hijacked for Telesleaze, the allocations for Telesleaze
have been deliberately made behind the same country code as "ordinary"
subscribers - when the necessary conditions for the fraud have been met:

[1]  The country concerned has little or ineffective regulation;
[2]  The country concerned has poor connectivity, leading to high
     settlement rates and low risk of their being negotiated down;

The idea is that most networks will not block calls numbers in those
ranges since calls "could" equally be genuine calls to those
countries.  It's the same rationale as was used by the spamhaus that
put Peacefire on an IP address in the same block as their most
prolific spam sources.

Tokelau's.  They're the only ones who can set up rebates to call
recipients.  It seems a little odd, though.  My long distance carrier,
which resells Qwest, charges only 18 cents/minute to call Tokelau, and
that doesn't offer much room to rebate a commission, while my
dial-around carrier Cognidial charges a plump $2.97.

Nobody hijacked the Guyanese country code.  GT&T is controlled by
Atlantic Tele-Network, a company in the USVI that briefly controlled
the USVI phone company and has investments in other minor phone
properties like the Cell One franchise in the Bahamas, the major ISP
in the USVI, and a paging company in Haiti.

When ATN bought GT&T, they got a decrepit third-world telco with
ridiculously low domestic rates, e.g., 24 cents a month for a
residential line, and only 13,500 lines.  (My family owned rural telco
in upstate NY has more than that.)

For political reasons they couldn't raise rates, so in 1993 they
decided to get into the "international audiotext" business a/k/a
telesleaze, and used the revenue to upgrade the system with new
switches and satellite stations for both international calls and
access to the remote swampy interior, and more than tripled the number
of lines to 55K.  They say that in 1997 the porn business tanked so
they went back to the government and finally got some reasonable rate
increases.

These are worst case scenarios.  Sullivan county in the Catskills is
hilly and rural, and has spotty coverage from both the systems
licensed there and spillover from other systems in adjacent counties.

The vendors probably thought they were doing their customers a favor,
since most of them charge expensive roaming fees when they roam into
other systems, but I suppose that it might be worth a software hack so
that calls to 911 ignore the usual system preference list and use the
strongest signal.

I have Cingular TDMA service in Tompkins county, which is between
about 100 miles west of Sullivan, and the coverage with my Nokia 5165
phone is pretty good, particularly with the car kit's external
antenna, except in some narrow valleys that are such bad dead spots
that the FM radio fades out, too.

Are you saying that it would be a violation of an FCC regulation to
make an emergency call on the wrong carrier?

The Amateur Radio service is regulated by the FCC and by international
treaty, but one of the regulations says "No provision of these rules
prevents the use by an amateur station in distress of any means at its
disposal to attract attention, make known its condition and location,
and obtain assistance" (FCC rules part 97.405).  I'd be surprised if
similar rules don't apply to other services in the case of a real
emergency.

Or are you saying that it's a violation for those phones *not* to
switch to another network?

Subject: Calling 800 Numbers From Pay Phone: How Many 24-cent Charges?
Date: Sun, 12 Jan 2003 23:18:56 -0700


Today, I used my MCI prepaid calling card for the first time. I called
the service from a pay phone, entered my account number, and called
two different numbers. (MCI uses ## to terminate calls).

During this one 800 number call, MCI charged me the 24 cent pay-phone
fee twice -- once for each completed call. 

What does the federal tariff say? I'm guessing that MCI is probably
reiembursing the pay phone owner for a single call and keeping the
second 24-cent charge.

If MCI only has the right to charge me one 24-cent fee, I'd like to
know who to complain to.

URLs on the appropriate tariff and, presuming MCI is in the wrong, how
to complain would be appreciated.

Thanks,

The non-profit I work for regularly sends out quite a large number of

I wanted to shift it across from the fax machine and use a software to

Subject: Glitch bungles Amazon orders


By Alorie Gilbert
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

Online retailer Amazon.com this week canceled thousands of orders for
a high-end cell phone that because of a technical glitch had appeared
to be free, an Amazon representative said Friday.

The glitch mistakenly allowed people to order the PCS Phone 
Handspring Treo 300 at no charge. The phone normally costs $200 after 
rebate on Amazon. It features a built-in Palm organizer, a color 
display and a miniature keyboard.

Amazon sent e-mail to affected customers Friday, notifying them of 
the mistake and that it had canceled the orders.

The problem, which Amazon fixed Thursday, affected only orders placed
through Web sites participating in the Amazon Associates program, not
orders made directly through Amazon.com, said company spokeswoman
Patty Smith. The Associates program gives some 900,000 Web sites the
ability to link to products sold on Amazon and lets people buy
products from Amazon via an associate's site.

Smith said she didn't know which associates sites nor how many
associates were involved in the bad orders. She also didn't know
whether the problem affected cell phone models other than the PCS
Phone Handspring Treo 300.

Subject: SonicBlue Says Development of New Devices on Track


By Ben Berkowitz

    LAS VEGAS, Jan 11 (Reuters) - A slow holiday shopping
season had a serious impact on consumer electronics sales, but
development of new devices connecting digital media and home
entertainment centers is still on track, according to the chief
executive of consumer electronics maker SonicBlue Inc.

    In an interview with Reuters on Friday at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Las Vegas, SonicBlue's Greg Ballard said
the holiday season weakened as people spent less money on
things for the home and more on relaxation.

 ...

    Ballard said the main impact of the suit has been to keep
the company from adding some features to devices in development
that he said would have been legal but may have invited further
legal action.

Subject: EFF Blasts Controversial Copyright Law


By Lisa M. Bowman
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
January 10, 2003, 9:35 AM PT

A controversial digital copyright law is quashing free speech and
choking innovation, according to a new study by longtime critics of
the measure.

In its new "Unintended Consequences" report released Thursday, the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) lists a variety of cases
triggered by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, a law passed in
1998 designed to bring copyright law into the digital age.

Hollywood studios, record labels and other intellectual property
holders lobbied hard for the law, fearing that the Internet would
become a forum for rampant piracy because it allows people to easily
copy and distribute digital products. Unlike analog copies, which lose
resolution with each replication, digital copies of products maintain
their high quality.

In its report, the EFF said aggressive applications of the law have
reached beyond the intention of the measure. The EFF said the DMCA has
had a threefold effect: chilling free expression and scientific
research; jeopardizing fair use; and impeding competition.

Subject: U.S. Radio Companies Prepare To Launch Digital Broadcasting


By ANNA WILDE MATHEWS
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL

Radio companies will begin transmitting digital programming in 40
markets early this year, the industry's first move to introduce the
technology, which will offer clearer sound to listeners.

The rollout is set to be announced Friday by iBiquity Digital Corp., a
closely held company, backed by broadcasters, that licenses
digital-radio technology. At the same time, the company said,
manufacturers are expected to begin offering digital-radio receivers
to retailers, which can begin selling them to consumers this spring.
"You've seen every other consumer-electronics application go digital,"
said Robert Struble, chief executive of iBiquity.

Major radio companies including Clear Channel Communications Inc. and 
Cox Radio Inc., majority owned by Cox Enterprises Inc., are expected 
to begin broadcasting stations digitally in markets including New 
York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. According to iBiquity, 
about 100 stations are expected to launch digital versions in the 
first quarter of the year.

The digital stations are received at the same spot on the dial as 
they are in analog form, but with far better sound. Broadcasters will 
be able to send text information such as song names or sports scores. 
"For us, this will be an opportunity to enhance our listener 
experience and bring radio into the digital age," said David Field, 
chief executive of Entercom Communications Corp, which will initially 
offer digital stations in Seattle and Boston.

%T   "Network Security: Private Communication in a Public World, 2e"

For communications security, this is the text.  As well as solid
conceptual background of cryptography and authentication, there is
overview coverage of specific security implementations, including
Kerberos, PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail), PGP (Pretty Good Privacy),
IPsec, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), AES (Advanced Encryption Standard),
and a variety of proprietary systems.  Where many security texts use
only UNIX examples, this one gives tips on Lotus Notes, NetWare, and
Windows NT.

Chapter one is an introduction, with a brief primer on networking,
some reasonable content on malware, and basic security models and
concepts.

Part one deals with cryptography.  The foundational concepts are
covered in chapter one.  Symmetric encryption, in chapter three, is
presented in terms of the operations of DES (Data Encryption
Standard), IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm), and AES. 
Chapter four details the major modes of DES.  The algorithms for a
number of hash functions and message digests are described in chapter
five.  Asymmetric algorithms, such as RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) and
Diffie-Hellman, are explained in chapter six, although one could wish
for just slightly more material, such as actual numeric computations,
that might reach a wider audience.  The number theory basis of much of
modern encryption is provided as well, in chapter seven.  More,
including a tiny bit on elliptic curves, is given in chapter eight.

Part two covers authentication.  The general problems are outlined in
chapter nine.  Chapter ten looks at the traditional means of
authenticating people: something you know, have, or are.  Various
problems in handshaking are reviewed in chapter eleven.  Chapter
twelve describes some strong protocols for passwords.

Part three examines a number of security standards.  Kerberos gets two
whole chapters, since we are provided with not only concepts but
actual packets: version 4 in thirteen and 5 in fourteen.  PKI (Public
Key Infrastructure) terms, components, and mechanisms are outlined in
chapter fifteen.  The basic problems in real-time communications
security are delineated in chapter sixteen.  Chapter seventeen
examines the authentication and encryption aspects of IPsec, while
chapter eighteen deals with key exchange packets.  SSL and TLS
(Transport Layer Security) are described in chapter nineteen.

Part four concentrates on electronic mail.  Chapter twenty lays out
the major concerns and problems.  Chapter twenty one discusses PEM and
S/MIME (Secure Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions).  PGP is covered
in chapter twenty two.

Part five contains miscellaneous topics.  Chapter twenty three looks
at firewalls, twenty four at a variety of specific security systems,
and twenty five at Web issues.  Folklore, in chapter twenty six,
briefly lists a number of simple "best practices" that aren't
generally part of formal security literature.

The explanations are thorough and well written, with a humour that
illuminates the material rather than obscuring it.  The organization
of the book may be a bit odd at times (the explanation of number
theory comes only after the discussion of encryption that it
supports), but generally makes sense.  (It is, sometimes, evident that
later text has created chapters that are slightly out of place.)  The
end of chapter "homework" problems are well thought out, and much
better than the usual reading completion test.  If there is a major
weakness in the book, it is that the level of detail seems to vary
arbitrarily, and readers may find this frustrating.  Overall, though,
this work provides a solid introduction and reference for network
security related topics and technologies.

What [MCI] charges YOU is governed by your contract with them; what
they re-emburse the owner of payphone is governed by the applicable

When the payphone surcharge was first installed, I remember a calling card
co saying that you could avoid subsequent fees by using the ## (it wasn't
MCI but most cards have something similar) to start a new call without
redialing the tollfree access number.  It may be the case however that
they must charge the fee each time, because the surcharge is supposed to
compensate the phone owner for calls made from the phone.

The FCC rules regarding payphone owner compensation are very clear -- they
require that payphone owners be compensated the same for "each and every"
completed call.  Hence, you are charged the "payphone surcharge" on each
call placed and completed, even if you sequence-call.

You were charged correctly, and, if MCI is following the rules
correctly, it will pay 48 cents to the payphone owner. Since we all
know that MCI is a paragon of accounting honesty and efficiency, I'm
sure that's exactly what will happen, give or take 48 cents.

The flip side of the coin is, if you dial MCI's access number, but do
not complete a call, neither you nor MCI owe the payphone owner
anything.

The FCC wrote the payphone compensation rules on the basis of "per
completed call." In the case of ordinary toll-free numbers, the meaning
is direct. However, in the case of calling cards, the call from the
payphone to the carrier doesn't count, only the completed calls
outbound from the carrier.

You can find reference to this issue here:
<http://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/Common_Carrier/Orders/1996/fcc96439.txt>

That's the original FCC order on payphone compensation, but be warned,
it's a long document mostly in legalese.

I would presume the CR engineers are smart enough to check and
appropriately set the networking options in each phone and not depend
on how the phones arrived out of the box (for instance on my SprintPCS
phone my coverage was marginal enough I turned roaming OFF to avoid
roaming when I really didn't want to, i.e. most of the time.

I think immediate access to 911 via any available means is the goal,
hence they should switch if they can.

No.

No, it's an FCC violation for the carriers not to accept 911 calls
from people who aren't their customers, or for a carrier to prevent
its phones from using other networks to dial 911. IOW, "in many cases,
the phones not kicking over is an FCC violation."

I believe that's what Danny meant.

I think that's it.

We are now considering doing this from a Windows ME box and it seems
that the commercial fax program Winfax Pro 10.02 is what we would

I don't understand how a valid country code can be abused as you
suggest.  I'd appreciate a further explanation.

And if MCI has no problem, why does AT&T have this problem?

BTW, I've now found that the Pitcairn Islands, country code 64, (with
less than 20 subscribers), has the same problem.  AT&T doesn't
acknowledge their existence, MCI will place a call for a reasonable
rate.

These are not academic discussions, BTW.  I was considering going to
Tokelau, but have postponed that trip, since I am going to Pitcairn.

least make them keep acquiring NIC's on a regular basis.  Does anyone
know of any tools to do this, or should I expect my vendor (SMC) to
provide this info (I didn't see it in the manual) from the AP itself?

I am getting ready to convert a LUCENT Legend Release 7.0 to T1 PRI,
and I have a couple of questions.

The local operating company BellSouth is going to supply a Fractional
PRI with internet data on DS0's 11-23.  Ch 24 is of course the B
channel.

And DS0's 1-10 will be dedicated to the Lucent Legend switch.  I am
looking for someone that has actually seen this done successfully, and
also would like to find out if caller ID on DOD calls has the options
of displaying the actual DID extension's phone number?  And finally,
on a call forward no answer (Lucent call this FWD with delay) will the
incoming called ID info be passed on through the DOD call?  Example,
someone on PSTN calls 555-555-1001, (which will DID to ext 101 on the
PBX). Ext 101 does not answer, call gets routed to another outside
line via two-way trunk over PRI. What will the destination end get for
caller ID?  Will it be the originating end's called ID or the
extension's called ID?

To reply, please note I have anti spam setup.  Please change the p to
an h as in hotmail.  Thanks very much for your time and help in
advance!  luvencl@potmail.com

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I can tell you my experience with SBC
and  forward on busy/no answer is that the eventual recipient of the
call (my cell phone, usually) gets the number of my house line, rather
than the caller's number. That's a nuisance, since my answer phrase
would change according to the number of the caller *if I knew what it
was*. Telco explained it to me this way: YOU are making the call to
your cell phone. We are simply automating the process. But oddly
enough, if I use immediate call forwarding on my home line, the number
of the original caller gets forwarded also. In other words, just the
opposite process. Any explanations for that?    PAT]

Subject: Ellacoya Lands New Customers, Funding


By Peter J. Howe, Globe Staff, 1/13/2003

What looks to be breathing new life into Ellacoya is the booming
traffic on Napster-inspired systems for sharing digital music and
video such as Kazaa, Morpheus, and Gnutella. The file-sharing systems
are creating big traffic headaches for commercial and college
broadband network operators.

Ellacoya chief executive Ron Sege, a former senior executive of Web
portal Lycos.com, said peer-to-peer file sharing 'is probably 10
times more popular now than it was at Napster's peak' before federal
courts shut down the pioneering service in the summer of 2000, ruling
that it faciliated massive theft of copyrighted content. But today,
network operators are finding 5 or 10 percent of their users are
hogging 70 percent of the network usage by sharing music and video
files over Napster successors.

Ellacoya's system enables broadband network operators to 'look 
into' data packets that are flowing over the network and give the 
highest priority to legitimate e-mail and Web surfing while making 
peer-to-peer traffic 'fly coach or standby instead of first-class,' 
Sege said.

While the underlying issue of the legality of content-sharing systems 
is still being sorted out, Sege said, network operators can use 
Ellacoya systems to push subscribers' multi-hour downloads of movie 
or music files to non-peak periods when the network has capacity -- or 
block them if the services are shut down.

Subject: Alliance to Offer an Alternative to Passport


By Hiawatha Bray, Globe Staff, 1/13/2003

The effort to construct an alternative to Microsoft Corp.'s Passport
network authentication system takes a step forward today, as Sun
Microsystems Inc. releases a software component that lets people
identify themselves to multiple computer systems in an organization.

The Sun ONE Identity Server is a vital component of a plan to create 
a service to let Internet users gain access to all of their online 
resources with the use of a single password, while protecting the 
users' privacy. Microsoft's Passport already provides a similar 
service, but Sun and many other corporations have been reluctant to 
become dependent on Microsoft to gain access to their customers. 
These partners, which include United Airlines, American Express, 
Sony, and General Motors, joined with Sun to form the Liberty 
Alliance, and to create an alternative to the Passport system.

Passport is already in use at Microsoft's own Internet sites and a 
few others, such as the eBay auction site and the Expedia online 
travel agency.

But the Liberty Alliance has yet to offer services to the public, 
mainly because the necessary software is still under development. 
That's the significance of the Sun ONE Identity Server, said Andy 
Eliopoulos, director of business management for Sun's network 
identity program.

Subject: Nextel to Expand 'Direct Connect'


Widens use outside home calling markets

By Peter J. Howe, Globe Staff, 1/13/2003

Wireless carrier Nextel Communications is announcing today plans for 
a major regional and national expansion of its 'direct-connect' 
walkie-talkie feature that has earned it a lucrative business-market 
niche in the highly competitive wireless industry.

Beginning this week, the company said, millions of Nextel subscribers
will be able to use the direct-connect feature outside their home
calling markets to have the equivalent of instant walkie-talkie
conversations with other Nextel users when they are both on the road.

Since Nextel launched the service ten years ago, it has been limited 
to users talking within their home service area, such as Eastern 
Massachusetts.

The first stage of the expansion will let Nextel subscribers use 
direct connect with subscribers from their home area when they travel 
with them in other service areas throughout the Northeast and parts 
of the Southwest, or with subscribers based in the home service area 
to which they have traveled.

Two Nextel subscribers or a group from Boston traveling to New York, 
Washington, or Los Angeles, for example, could direct connect with 
each other in those markets or with Nextel subscibers based in those 
markets.

TELEVISION REVIEW

By Sam Allis, Globe Staff, 1/13/2003

If you don't know much about the astonishing rise of Chicago in the 
19th century, or if you're a Chicago chauvinist, 'Chicago: City of 
the Century' is rich gruel. If, however, you're remotely familiar 
with that piece of American history, these 4 1/2 hours will present 
more than you probably ever want to know about the place at the time. 
This 'American Experience,' which begins tonight on WGBH-TV (Ch. 
2), would have been a feast at two hours.

This latest entry in the PBS nonfiction roster (it continues tomorrow
night and Wednesday; each 90-minute segment begins at 9 p.m.) is ably
written, produced, and directed by Austin Hoyt, the veteran
documentarian who did superb profiles of Ronald Reagan, Douglas
MacArthur, and Andrew Carnegie. The reporting here is excellent, the
detail illuminating, the writing clean.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Of course, Monty, I am no longer a
resident of Chicago, IL. Much of the material on the show I know about
already, since I produced a radio show called 'Traces of Chicago'
which aired every Sunday afternoon/Tuesday overnight on CRIS Radio,
the station maintained by the Chicago Public Library. I did 'Traces'
for 13 years. Each episode was originally produced by myself. Bill
Pfeiffer got me that job, back around 1980. 'Traces' dealt with the
history of Chicago over 150 years more or less, 1837 to the present 
time. It was aired every Sunday afternoon, and repeated on tape every
Tuesday overnight. I guess I did about 700 shows in the overall
series.  <C>hicago <R>adio <I>nformation <S>ervice is intended for

I worked as a volunteer for the Chicago Public Library, for close to
twenty years. My first position for them was 'sysop' for an Apple ][+
BBS they started in 1980 at my suggestion. CPL had the first computer
bulletin board system at a library anywhere in the world; it was quite
innovative in my opinion. I think CRIS radio was also the first
reading service of its kind in the world as well.  PAT]

Subject: Time to Rethink Digital Copyright Act


UPGRADE

By Hiawatha Bray, Globe Staff, 1/13/2003

A lovely state, Kentucky, but not a place that's generally in the 
forefront either of law or technology. As a matter of fact, it may 
just have taken a giant step backward.

Lexmark International Inc. of Lexington, Ky., is one of the world's 
leading makers of computer printers. It's a robust business, but one 
with a curious pricing model. Most printers are relatively cheap; 
it's the replacement ink or toner cartridges that cost a fortune, and 
enable companies like Lexmark to turn a profit.

Inevitably, consumers griped about the high cost of replacement 
cartridges from Lexmark and other printer firms. And the used 
cartridges were perfectly good, except for needing a refill. So an 
industry was born - companies that collected the old cartridges, 
refilled them, and resold them for much less than the printer 
companies.

This enraged the printer makers, who can't turn a profit without the 
extortionate revenues derived from cartridge sales. So they've tried 
to stifle the makers of aftermarket cartridges. Their ultimate weapon 
is a microchip built into the cartridges that cause them to 
malfunction if any attempt is made to reuse the cartridge. Some 
companies use chips that cause certain features of the printer to 
stop working. But Lexmark goes further, using a feature known to its 
critics as the 'killer chip.' Use an unauthorized cartridge in some 
of their laser printers, and it just won't work.

Unless the remanufactured cartridge has a replacement chip that works 
just fine with the printer. Static Control Components Inc., of 
Sanford, N.C., supplies such chips to cartridge recyclers. And for 
that, the company has fallen foul of a very foul law. Yes, once 
again, it's that bane to technological innovation: the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act.

Subject: RFID Tags: Big Brother in Small Packages


By Declan McCullagh

Could we be constantly tracked through our clothes, shoes or even our 
cash in the future?

I'm not talking about having a microchip surgically implanted beneath 
your skin, which is what Applied Digital Systems of Palm Beach, Fla., 
would like to do. Nor am I talking about John Poindexter's creepy 
Total Information Awareness spy-veillance system, which I wrote about 
last week.

Instead, in the future, we could be tracked because we'll be wearing, 
eating and carrying objects that are carefully designed to do so.

The generic name for this technology is RFID, which stands for radio 
frequency identification. RFID tags are miniscule microchips, which 
already have shrunk to half the size of a grain of sand. They listen 
for a radio query and respond by transmitting their unique ID code. 
Most RFID tags have no batteries: They use the power from the initial 
radio signal to transmit their response.

You should become familiar with RFID technology because you'll be 
hearing much more about it soon. Retailers adore the concept, and 
CNET News.com's own Alorie Gilbert wrote last week about how Wal-Mart 
and the U.K.-based grocery chain Tesco are starting to install "smart 
shelves" with networked RFID readers. In what will become the largest 
test of the technology, consumer goods giant Gillette recently said 
it would purchase 500 million RFID tags from Alien Technology of 
Morgan Hill, Calif.

Subject: Music, Tech Groups OK Copyright Plans


(AP Online)

The leading trade associations for the music and technology
industries, which have been at loggerheads over consumers downloading
songs on the Internet, have negotiated a compromise they contend will
protect copyrights on movies and music without new government
involvement.

Lobbyists for some of the nation's largest technology companies will
argue under the new agreement against efforts in Congress to amend
U.S. laws to broaden the rights of consumers, such as explicitly
permitting viewers to make backup copies of DVDs for personal use or
copy songs onto handheld listening devices.

The agreement, expected to be announced Tuesday in Washington,
attempts to head off government intervention in the rising debate over
what consumers can do with copyrighted material they have
purchased. The battle over copyrights, pitting Hollywood against
Silicon Valley, has emerged as a central policy question for this
Congress.

Subject: Sued for Following Suit in TV-Land


POWER LUNCH
By Ron Grover

Hardly flattered, Les Moonves and CBS are suing ABC over what they 
contend is a show that consciously mimics CBS's Survivor.

No one likes combat sport more than Leslie Moonves. In his Los Angeles
office, the CBS president even keeps a punching bag, which no doubt
came in handy for relieving stress when poor ratings sunk his new
sitcom, Bram & Alice, after only four episodes this fall. More often
than not, though, it has been Moonves standing over the TV fallen.
This year, in fact, CBS is the only one of the four largest networks
to have seen its audience grow. As of January, it's also the top-rated
net in the land.

And Moonves doesn't mind putting up his dukes when it comes to the 
competition. Last year, the one-time actor came out swinging against 
ABC, which tried to lure away CBS's late-night talk-show host David 
Letterman. Now he's at it again, this time taking on one of the most 
time-honored of Hollywood traditions: The Great Pretender.

If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, Hollywood must be the
most sincere place on earth. Think about it. How many times have you
flicked on the tube and thought you've seen a show before? Well, heck,
you have! Despite all the creative geniuses who belly up to their
tables at Spago, what Hollywood does best is repackage the same few
concepts over and over.

Date: Tue, 14 Jan 2003 18:17:45 -0500


By Yukari Iwatani

    CHICAGO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - If executives at the world's
second-largest mobile phone maker, Motorola Inc. (NYSE:MOT), are
having trouble sleeping, it could be because they are getting a
wake-up call from Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (KOREA:05930)

The South Korean cell phone maker is known for the aggressive ways in
which it gains and keeps contracts.

Last year it flew 400 engineers halfway around the world from Korea to
Kansas, where they worked round-the-clock with colleagues back home to
produce a new phone for U.S. wireless telephone operator Sprint PCS
Group (NYSE:PCS).

That kind of determination has helped Samsung double its market share
in two years, overtaking both Germany's Siemens AG and Sony Ericsson
(SWED:ERIC.B)(TOKYO:6758). The Korean handset maker vaulted into the
world's No. 3 position in 2002 from No. 6 in 2000, and is now knocking
on the doors of market leaders Nokia (HELS:NOK1V) and Motorola.

Wireless industry analysts expect Samsung to boost its global share to
15 percent by 2004 from 10.6 percent at the end of last year's third
quarter. At that rate it could overtake Motorola, which according to
Gartner Dataquest had 14.4 percent market share at the end of the same
period.

Well, except for the ones who are awaiting trial -- sometimes for a

Is keeping them from making phone calls cheaply really an intentional
punishment?  If so, why not just keep them from making any phone calls
 -- or perhaps restricting them to one call a month? (not to exceed
three minutes.)

I thought that there also is supposed to be an aim of rehabilitation
along with punishment -- and keeping prisoners from talking to their
families might actually be counter productive.


henry schaffer
hes@ncsu.edu

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Henry, your *theory* is quite correct.
One thing that Joey Lindstrom did not realize when he wrote his screed
(and I neglected to respond on) was the large number of people locked
up in dungeon-like jails (Cook County in Chicago -- the largest jail
in the world -- for one example) who are treated *as though they are
already guilty* even though they have not been to court; oftentimes
not even once at that point. It is quite common for an arrested person
being held at Cook County Jail to not even be allowed to contact his
lawyer or family for the first three or four days of his arrival; then
when he *can* get to a phone, it has to be one of those (pardon me!)
God-damned collect calls for several dollars. They do everything in
their power to work around the requirement that inmates be allowed to
notify family and attornies of their whereabouts, all in the name of
institutional administrivia of course. Even the payphones in the
police lockups in Chicago are on the same system. From the *very
instant* one of the fine, noble, honest police officers in the
'Chicago system' (i.e. Chicago, and any of the suburbs) puts his
sights on you, forget about any phone calls until *he* decides you
should be allowed to make one, and then it will be at a payphone which
is set to only make collect outgoing calls, using an automated
operator-voice which informs the recipient of the call that 'this is a
collect call from an inmate in a correctional institution, will you
accept the charges? Press one to accept, two to decline.' And God help
you if you do decide to accept it. If you do not press one or two, but
simply stand there trying to make sense of it all, the message will
repeat itself a couple times, then assume you said 'no' and disconnect,
telling the arrested party the charges were declined. 'Rehabilitation'
is not a word in the vocabulary of a police officer or other correctional
employee in Chicago. Oh, for a few very young, very liberal social 
workers running around in the jail it is, but they soon grow out of
it also. And yes, there are many jail inmates who are there for a year
or more awaiting trial. Often times, if the police/prosecutor case is
weak or non-existent, they know the only punishment you will get at
all is the administrivia they can dish out, so they put you on a back
burner and let you stew for a year or so before a trial is set up. PAT]

So you think that the prisoners might be innocent or unfairly punished by
juries and the next rounds of appeals.   But you were in such hurry to
celebrate excusing brutal murders that you don't care at all that the
convicts who Ryan commuted to life or 40 years in prison just lose their
future appellate review process.  While they were on death row, they were
awaiting their right to further appellate review.  That's gone.  What could
be more arbitrary then removing the right to an appeal that these convicts
no longer have?  If these convicts were really innocent, tough luck now.

With a stroke of the pen Mr. Ryan overruled the decisions of 167 judges and
juries.  He complained that the death penalty is arbitrary, yet there is
nothing more arbitrary then across the board executive orders.

So who were these nice people Mr. Ryan just excused?  "In 1999 with
the help of his girlfriend, Fedell Caffey shot and killed a
28-year-old pregnant mother, her 10-year-old daughter and her
7-year-old son. If that weren't horrific enough, the two then carved a
nearly full-term unborn child from the mother's body with a pair of
scissors.

Then there's Howard Bean, who disguised himself as a priest and then
handcuffed and shot 81-year-old Dorothy Polulach inside her home. Or
Lenard Johnson, who murdered an 11-year-old boy he'd been babysitting
and was holding a knife to the throat of one of two girls he'd raped
when the police arrived. "As far as the evidence goes, it's pretty
overwhelming against my client," Johnson's public defender was quoted
as saying.

There's also the odor of bad faith. Barely a month ago, Governor Ryan
met with families of the people raped or killed or attacked by these
inmates and told them he was leaning against a blanket reprieve. "They
have a right to feel betrayed," the Governor admitted after his
speech."  -excerpt from "Wall St Journal"

It is interesting you can stereotype all "Police" and tell us what
"Police" hate and what "Police" want.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Ms. Davis, I can stereotype all police
in the same way you can stereotype all death row inmates. One good stereo-
type deserves another, wouldn't you agree? You say death row inmates
are all guilty as hell; I suggest many/most Chicago area prosecutors
and police officers are going to the same place. They don't even begin
to deal in good faith. All the truly guilty people on death row are
not worth one innocent person there. And Ryan found not one; not two, 
but *four* totally innocent men on death row, to say nothing of the 
*13 other cases* of innocence there which your beloved system got
around to discharging without so much as a single 'we are sorry for
this' over the past few years. Ryan only totally released four, the
system in its good time released 13 others before he got involved. PAT]

%T   "Web Security, Privacy and Commerce"

Anyone who does not know the names Spafford and Garfinkel simply does
not know the field of data security.  The authors, therefore, are well
aware that data security becomes more complex with each passing week. 
This is, after all, the second edition of what was originally
published under the title "Web Security and Commerce," and, while it
is still recognizable as such, the work is essentially completely re-
written.  The authors note, in the Preface, that the book cannot hope
to cover all aspects of Web security, and therefore they concentrate
on those topics that are absolutely central to the concept, and/or not
widely available elsewhere.  Works on related issues are suggested
both at the beginning and end of the book.

A greatly expanded part one introduces the topic, and the various
factors involved in Web security.  Chapter one is a very brief
overview of Web security considerations and requirements, with some
material on general security concepts and risk analysis.  The
underlying architecture of the Web is examined in chapter two,
although this is basically limited to Internet structures.  (While the
material is quite informative, perhaps some examples of HTTP
[HyperText Transfer Protocol] would add value.)  Cryptography is
explained reasonably well in chapter three: there is no in-depth
discussion of cryptographic algorithms, but these details can be
readily found in other works.  Chapter four deals with cryptographic
uses, and also with legal restrictions.  The concepts and limitations
of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are
given in chapter five, although the operational details are not
covered.  Chapter six starts out with a general discussion of
identification and authentication,but then gets bogged down in the
details of using PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).  The coverage of digital
certificates, in chapter seven, is likewise constricted by a
dependence upon system technicalities.

Part two concerns the user.  

Chapter two looks at the various possible problems with browsers, not
all of which are related to Web page programming.  Chapter eight looks
analytically at the possible invasions of privacy that can occur on
the Web.  Some non-technical techniques of protecting your privacy,
such as good password choice, are described in chapter nine, with
various technical means listed in chapter ten.  Chapter eleven reviews
backups and some physical protection systems.  ActiveX and the
limitations of authentication certificates, as well as plugins and
Visual Basic, are thoroughly explored in chapter twelve.  Java
security is only marginally understood by many "experts," and not at
all by users, so the coverage in chapter thirteen is careful to point
out the difference between safety, security, and the kind of security
risks that can occur even if the sandbox *is* secure.

Part three details technical aspects of securing Web servers.  Chapter
fourteen looks at physical security and disaster recovery measures. 
Traditional host security weaknesses are reviewed in chapter fifteen. 
Rules for secure CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and API (Application
Programmer Interface) programming are promulgated in chapter sixteen,
along with tips for various languages.  More details on the server-
side use of SSL is given in chapter seventeen.  Chapter eighteen looks
at specific strengthening measures for Web servers.  You legal options
for prosecuting a computer crime is reviewed in chapter nineteen.

Commercial and societal concerns in regard to content are major areas
in Web security, so part six reviews a number of topics related to
commerce, as well as other social factors.  Chapter twenty discusses a
number of technical access control technologies, by system.  Obtaining
a client-side certificate is described in chapter twenty one. 
Microsoft's Authenticode system is reviewed yet again in chapter
twenty two.  Censorship and site blocking are carefully examined in
chapter twenty three.  Privacy policies, systems, and legislation are
reviewed in chapter twenty four.  Chapter twenty five looks at current
non-cash payment systems, and the various existing, and proposed,
digital payment systems for online commerce.  Having already studied
criminal problems earlier, the book now turns to civil and
intellectual property issues, such as copyright, in chapter twenty
six.

Although it has almost nothing to do with Web security as such, I very
much enjoyed Appendix A, Garfinkel's recounting of the lessons learned
in setting up a small ISP (Internet Service Provider).  (I suppose
that this could be considered valid coverage of Web commerce.)  The
other appendices are more directly related to the topic, including the
SSL protocol, the PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection)
specification, and references.

Although the material has been valuably expanded and updated, some of
the new content is less worthwhile.  The extensive space given to
specific products will probably date quickly, although the surrounding
conceptual text will continue to provide helpful guidance.  Certainly
for anyone dealing with Web servers or running ISPs, this is a
reference to consider seriously.

    WASHINGTON, Jan 14 (Reuters) - U.S. officials will probably not
radically lift ownership limits on television stations, newspapers and

        Program Allows for Robust Security Audits of Windows Platform

    REDMOND, Wash., Jan. 14 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- National
governments and their principal agencies face more serious security
threats than other technology consumers do. In matters ranging from
national defense to protection of citizens' personal data, national
governments must place security at the forefront of their information
technology requirements.  

Recognizing this, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) today announced the
Government Security Program (GSP), a global initiative that provides
national governments with controlled access to Microsoft(R) Windows(R)
source code and other technical information they need to be confident
in the enhanced security features of the Windows platform. The GSP is
one integral element in Microsoft's efforts to address the unique
security requirements of governments and international organizations
throughout the world.  Russia and NATO have already signed GSP
agreements with Microsoft, and the company is in discussions with more
than 20 countries about their interest in the program.  Participation
in the GSP will be disclosed at the discretion of each government
signatory, and Microsoft is committed to honoring confidentiality
where necessary.

10 January 2003 Vatican Warns Against On-Line Confession

The Vatican has warned against using the Internet to hear confessions,
as hackers could potentially use the private information to blackmail
people.

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-538079,00.html

[Editor's Note (Grefer): It would be just as easy to bug a church's
confessional.]

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: In fact that was done a few times. The
confessional at St. Peter's Church in Chicago was bugged by police a
few years ago when the police were trying to catch someone. Police did
not have authority to do this from the Pope, the Cardinal (in Chicago),
or any of the priests assigned to hear confessions at St. Peter's
Church. They just did it ... after all, we are police, we don't need
to get any permission to do our thing. It was the old 'Red Squad' unit
in the Chicago Police. When the bug was found, and exterminated, Chicago
Police were asked about it: Their only comment, a very lame one at
that was, 'we sure hope there were not any hard feelings'. Oddly, or
maybe not so odd, that was the same thing they said after Governor
Ryan pardoned and released uneqivically four men from death row this
past week, whose innocence was firmly established.  PAT]

West Point has established what it believes to be a highly secure
wireless network on its campus. The security measures, which include
a virtual private network (VPN) and sixty access controllers, cost the
school five times what it paid for the wireless network itself. Because
its network is connected to the Defense Department's network, West
Point wanted to make sure every security precaution was taken.

Actually I think they can change their MAC address at any time, even
faking other vendors' cards.

You might be better off accepting connections in the AP only from the
listed MAC, and even that doesn't protect you under all circumstances
from the war-rider impersonating your MAC address and grabbing your
traffic.

Pointless.  When they are cracking their way in, expect to see them
duplicate your own MAC address, as many APs now have MAC access list control.

I have an Apple AirPort setup. The config software for the base station
allows me as one of the security options to restrict connections to a
white list of permitted MACs. You have to have both a known MAC address
and the password. If your MAC isn't on my list, you're out of luck.

I would expect that my packets will still be out there for the world to
sniff, but at least strangers can't inject any packets into my network.

I don't know of any stronger measures you can take; if someone just
passively eavesdrops on your packets, it's nearly impossible to detect,
let alone prevent.

[Of course, it happens that my MACs are associated with Macs, but
that's a coincidence.]

If you'd clicked on the link and read the full article on the CU web
site, it claims that there's an FCC rule that requires analog cell
phones to use the strongest available system for 911 calls, but the
rule apparently hasn't been extended to digital and dual-mode phone.

So it looks like viruses, worms, trojans, etc. attached to

Or does this law apply only to the RIAA and members?

Bitfax would probably do just fine ...

I use V 3.30.06 (which dates back to somewhere around Windows 3.1)
but still works just fine under my current 98 SE, and I have yet to
find a low-priced alternative that is anything like as good ....     I
also run it full time on an *old* machine to receive faxes, and unlike

I would take a serious look at one of the old Bitfaxes first ... it's

Subject: Caller ID on CFWD No Answer on Merlin Legend


I'm curious about responses from others on this as well.  Here's what
I know ...

I'm running a Legend rel 7 v9.0 CKE3 with a PRI from a CLEC on a
DMS100 CO using 23B + D.  I can't speak to the drop-and-insert for
data connectivity.

With respect to the forwarding ... I forward my extension to my wireless 
phone when I leave the office every day. The only CallerID I see on 
'forwarded' calls is the BTN/ANI for the PRI trunk group.  If we place a 
regular DOD call from a station, the proper CallerID is sent.  The Legend 
can only handle a single NPA/NXX for callerID purposes, so if you intend to 
send station specific CallerID information, you need to be sure that every 
station fits within your DID plan, and that they are ALL in the same 
npa/nxx.  (If you do place an outbound call with a 'non-did' station, it 
will be prepended with your DID npa/nxx, and will display the 'wrong' 
number on the far end.

I don't know if that 'mistake' is illegal or not.)

The only 'other' option is to assign a static CallerID assignment on a
'per B channel' basis (like having copper trunks with one number per
trunk).  Another consideration for the above is whether your telco
validates the CallerID being sent.  (For example, since we have a
'mixed' npa/nxx DID range, I was trying to configure our toll-free
number on each B channel so that would be displayed on the far
end ... however our CLEC won't pass the toll-free number.)

As far as forwarding in the 'rest of the world' ... I think it's a
matter of telco implementation.  I also forward my home phone
(provided by an RBOC LEC on a 5ESS) to my wireless phone, and the
number that is displayed on the 'forward destination' end is the
'original' caller, and not my home (forwarding) number.

settings eliminated more than 95% of high priority vulnerabilities (as
determined by a popular commercial scanner) and 91% of all
vulnerabilities.  Download the complete IA Newsletter at

British programmer Dan Jackson has posted software that circumvents
the copy protection on Microsoft Reader e-book software. Both the
program and its source code are posted on Jackson's site; the program's
creator wants to remain anonymous, according to Jackson. He says his
involvement with the project stems from his desire "to read e-books
on older platforms." Microsoft is examining its options, which include
taking legal action.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note specifically to Murray:  We have heard

those people do not want their stuff copied/abused by others, then
they should not be putting it on the net. My short e-book, *Genesis 39*

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Warning: use of camera-equipped mobile phones 
could be hazardous to your health.

That's the message going out from at least one chain of health clubs 
in Hong Kong, where a new generation of cell phones that can take and 
transmit video and still photos is raising concerns over a new crop 
of privacy-related issues.

Physical, which operates nine gyms in the former British colony, 
recently posted signs in its Hong Kong facilities forbidding the use 
of mobile phones in locker rooms.

Subject: Supreme Court Upholds Copyright Law Extension


By James Vicini

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court upheld Wednesday a 1998
law extending copyright protection by 20 years, delaying when creative
works such as Walt Disney Co.'s Mickey Mouse cartoons, F.  Scott
Fitzgerald's novels and George Gershwin's songs become public
property.

The 7-2 ruling was a victory for supporters of the law, including
large media companies and song publishers that argued the longer term
was needed to protect a vital industry that contributes more than $500
billion to the U.S. economy.

It dealt a defeat to an Internet publisher and others who challenged
the law for limiting free speech and for harming the creative process
by locking up material that they said should be in the public domain
for all to use without charge.

Subject: Unintended Consequences: Four Years under the DMCA


1.	Executive Summary

Since they were enacted in 1998, the "anti-circumvention" provisions 
of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA"), codified in section 
1201 of the Copyright Act, have not been used as Congress envisioned. 
Congress meant to stop copyright pirates from defeating anti-piracy 
protections added to copyrighted works, and to ban "black box" 
devices intended for that purpose.[1]

In practice, the anti-circumvention provisions have been used to 
stifle a wide array of legitimate activities, rather than to stop 
copyright piracy. As a result, the DMCA has developed into a serious 
threat to three important public policy priorities:

Section 1201 Chills Free Expression and Scientific Research.

Experience with section 1201 demonstrates that it is being used to 
stifle free speech and scientific research. The lawsuit against 2600 
magazine, threats against Princeton Professor Edward Felten's team of 
researchers, and prosecution of Russian programmer Dmitry Sklyarov 
have chilled the legitimate activities of journalists, publishers, 
scientists, students, programmers, and members of the public.


Section 1201 Jeopardizes Fair Use.

By banning all acts of circumvention, and all technologies and tools 
that can be used for circumvention, section 1201 grants to copyright 
owners the power to unilaterally eliminate the public's fair use 
rights. Already, the music industry has begun deploying 
"copy-protected CDs" that promise to curtail consumers' ability to 
make legitimate, personal copies of music they have purchased.

Section 1201 Impedes Competition and Innovation.

Rather than focusing on pirates, many copyright owners have chosen to 
use the DMCA to hinder their legitimate competitors. For example, 
Sony has invoked section 1201 to protect their monopoly on 
Playstation video game consoles, as well as their "regionalization" 
system limiting users in one country from playing games legitimately 
purchased in another.

This document collects a number of reported cases where the 
anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA have been invoked not 
against pirates, but against consumers, scientists, and legitimate 
competitors. It will be updated from time to time as additional cases 
come to light. The latest version can always be obtained at 
www.eff.org.

Subject: Started as a Gimmick, Ring-Tone Sales Near $1 Billion


By Bernhard Warner, European Internet Correspondent

    LONDON, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Ring tones, those ubiquitous,
monophonic song recordings programmed into seemingly every teenager's
mobile phone, are quietly becoming a money-maker for the music
industry.

    A new study released Wednesday by London-based Informa Media Group
said that authors' collection societies collected $71 million in
royalties from ring-tone sales in 2002, up 58 percent from the
previous year.

    Informa's senior analyst Simon Dyson said the royalties figure --
which is typically 10-15 percent of the total sales from ring tones --
would suggest that the overall market is over $700 million annually,
and quite possibly as high as $1 billion.

    The proceeds are divided between operators, labels and the
artists.

Subject: Colombia Cellphone Firms Sue Rival for Trespassing


BOGOTA, Colombia, Jan 15 (Reuters) - Colombia's two mobile phone
operators, BellSouth Colombia and Comcel, have said they eparately
sued utility Empresas Publicas de Medellin (EPM) for a total of $200
million for allegedly infringing on their business.

    BellSouth Colombia, a subsidiary of U.S. firm BellSouth Corp.
(NYSE:BLS), and Comcel, controlled by Mexico's America Movil
(NYSE:AMX), said late on Tuesday that EPM's provision of a local
wireless loop service to subscribers in the cities of Bogota and
Medellin was effectively a mobile phone service.

    The wireless loop technology allows subscribers to use a portable
handset with their fixed-line phone up to a distance of about 25 miles
(40 km).

    EPM, which is controlled by the city of Medellin, only has a
license for providing fixed-line telephone services.

Subject: RIAA Calls Hacking Claim a Hoax


By Robert Lemos
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

Claims that the music industry hired a group of hackers to create a 
worm to infect peer-to-peer networks are being dismissed by security 
experts.

In an advisory posted to security mailing lists, a group called
Gobbles Security delivered its latest vulnerability -- a real one
found in a relatively unknown MP3 player -- wrapped in an apparent
joke aimed at the Recording Industry Association of America. The main
part of the advisory consisted of Gobbles' claims that its programmers
had created a "hydra" -- a worm capable of spreading in a variety of
ways -- that infects all major music software.

The RIAA, the organization that represents major music publishers, 
wasn't amused. "It's a complete hoax," said an RIAA spokesman, who 
asked that his name not be used. "It's not true."

Don't forget that in computing, what can be done can be undone. The RIAA 
is up against a world full of computer talent that does not necessarily 
agree with its tactics.

In turning to quasi-lawlessness, the RIAA is forgetting that its
targets enjoy the same lack of legal constraint. Anyone who's computer
is being invaded by RIAA tactics is well within his rights to protect
himself from the attack and to assist others to protect themselves
from the same.

I would imagine that virus scanning software will be quite capable of
detecting any bogus files, regardless of their source. If the RIAA
tries to coerce the software companies into ignoring the "official
infections", a great opportunity will be created for small competitors
in that field to rise to the top.

Subject: Mobile Phones Lose Millions of Text Messages
Date: Wed, 15 Jan 2003 15:35:31 -0500


CHICAGO, Illinois (Reuters) -- Millions of short text messages sent
between mobile phones in the United States are lost every month, and
the chance of two parties connecting depends on which networks they
use, a study released Wednesday says.

Internet performance measurement company Keynote Systems Inc.  says in
its study that 7.5 percent of all short text messages sent between
wireless telephone companies are lost.

The increasingly popular service known as SMS (Short Message Service)
allows mobile phone users to send brief messages instantaneously to
their friends and family.  It typically costs 10 cents to send a
message and pennies to nothing to receive one.

  Subject: AT&T wireless internet at $4000 a month!! Look out!!

Jan 7/03  Vancouver, Canada

I believe I may have received the largest bill AT&T has ever
fabricated for one month of wireless internet access.  $3996.33!!  Can
anyone top this or have you received a similar bill.

A little background.  I wanted wireless internet access from my laptop
and decided on the PCMCIA Sierra Wireless Aircard 750, using the new
GPRS connectivity through Rogers AT&T.  They had a promo package, and
I signed a six month contract for unlimited internet access for
$50/mo. CAD  Not a bad deal and for the most part the system worked
pretty well.  The aircard itself was pretty expensive at $599 CAD, but
since I'm completly mobile, living in my motorhome, this seemed like a
pretty good solution.

Things went along fine until the contract ended, when without
informing me they switched the billing to 5MB for $30.  Classic bait
and switch.  So I was happily surfing away as the $$$ piled up.  And
boy do they pile up fast.

I did a little experiment.  The aircard has a counter that allows you
to see how many KB are coming down the pipe.  I loaded an average web
page,and the counter was already over 6 MB in 30 seconds.  So in the
first minute of surfing the net, it had already cost me $30 and AT&T
was into the gravy.  Even though, from what I recall, the GPRS system
was usually only capable of 3KB/sec downloads, giving 180 KB/minute-
thats what the counter showed and thats how I was billed.

You can get into trouble real fast with this system.  How does
something that cost $50 one month become $4000 the next?  The first
way is to switch your contract hoping you don't notice.  I didn't.
The next way is that data in MB and KB is very difficult to control
when surfing the net, and not easily understood the way regular cell
phones are billed in minutes and seconds.  It is more intangable.  For
example, a 5MB plan would seem like a lot, but everything is tallied
and billed in KB.  Some of you whizzes will immediatly know that
5MB=5,000 KB, which is a pittance when surfing the net as I have
already shown.  For most people this would not be easy to understand.

As most of you already know, and as I add this post to the gazillion
under "AT&T SUCKS", I didn't get very far when trying to get customer
support to see the insanity of this bill.

I don't think the morons at AT&T realize the difference between text
messaging on the GSM/GPRS phones where 5 MB would make some sense, and
full blown graphical and data intensive internet access through a
wireless aircard.  In fact I'm almost certain they don't even know the
difference, since your aircard is paired to a phone number.  The
absolute highest plan they can come up with after your unlimited promo
is 80 MB for $145 CAD.  This would be good for a few hours of surfing
the net, a little email and internet banking and insanely expense for
internet access.

I hope anyone considering wireless internet access via aircard and
AT&T will see that this is not a viable option as it is presently
structured.  Also for anyone signed on to their "bait and switch"
promo, be careful.

Subject: ANI and TracFone
Date: 15 Jan 2003 08:48:25 -0800
Organization: http://groups.google.com/


Hello,

I have an old analog TracFone and I was wondering if when I call
somewhere that has ANI (not Caller ID) such has a business or 800
number, if they get my name and address.  I know they ALWAYS get the
phone number but I wasn't sure about the other info.  TracFone does
have my name, address and phone number in their records but since this
is a prepaid phone I did not know if it goes out along with the ANI.

For instance, if I call a company for product info. I don't want them
to end up having my name and address to send tons of junk mail or
start calling my home number with sales calls.  Again, I realize they
get the cell number but that's OK.

Hope this made sense.

Thanks to anyone who can answer.

Kelly


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Have you tried using that phone to call
yourself at a number you control with caller ID to see how it looks?
That would be about the easiest way to tell what is being sent. I know
early on I tried using my (original) AT&T cell phone to call myself 
and look at the caller-ID screen when the call came through. I also
used a very old Motorola bag phone (which I have on prepaid service)
to call myself at my home number. Depending on the caller ID box -- I
have three of them, all stand-alones from different manufacturers,
they would (using the old Motorola bag phone) either have nothing at
all to say other than the number, or it would identify me as 'wireless
caller' and the number. PAT]

Chat on the phone to support scientific research and earn a chance to win
$1000!

The Linguistic Data Consortium at the University of Pennsylvania
(www.ldc.upenn.edu) needs participants for FISHER, a new telephone
speech study to be conducted in the Early Winter 2002-2003.  FISHER is
open to all fluent speakers of English, native and non-native alike.
In contrast to our prior regional telephone studies (Switchboard),
FISHER will cover the entire US. The FISHER project will support
linguistic research, technology development and education.  All calls
will be recorded for these purposes and we will keep participant
identities strictly confidential.

FISHER participants will take part in 1 to 3 telephone calls talking
for ten minutes to other participants on suggested topics.  FISHER
topics can be found at the URL below:

    http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Projects/EARS/Fisher/topics.html

A robot operator will initiate all calls. Participants need only
answer their phones at the times they specify during the registration
process.

Participants will be compensated $10 per call.  In addition, for each
call made, participants will be eligible for 1 chance at (3) $1000.00
lottery prizes.

This study is open to any fluent speaker of English in the US. You
need not be a US citizen to participate.  You need only have the
ability to answer a phone in the US.  If you know of anyone who might
be interested in contributing a few minutes of their time to support
research, we would greatly appreciate your making them aware of this
opportunity.

To register for this study please visit the following page:

This is a syntactical misunderstanding for which I'll take the blame.
Maybe this is more common on this side of the border, but I've always
assigned different meanings to the words "prison" and "jail".  The
former refers to the place you get sent to *AFTER* conviction.  The
latter refers to the place you spend time in *PRIOR* to conviction.

Everything I said, refered to "prison" - ie: to people convicted of
crimes.

Let me say for the record that when it comes to situations as you've
outlined, ie: people AWAITING TRIAL, I agree 100% that they are being
treated SHAMEFULLY - in other words (mark the time and date!) I agree
with you.  The assumption of innocence before a finding of guilt is
absolutely fundamental and sacrosact and is, last time I checked,
enshrined in the constitutions of both our nations.  I can see why the
outgoing Republican governor of Illinois pardoned all those guys on
death row.  I initially felt he had gone way too far, until I delved
further into the story and found it wasn't really a blanket pardon, but
was well-reasoned and tailored to each individual case.

But we're getting off the track.  Back to Henry:

>> We now assume their guilt -- and thus the appropriateness of

> Is keeping them from making phone calls cheaply really an intentional

Well, as has been mentioned, some jurisdictions have advocate judges
who've decided to write new law, and have thus guaranteed that
criminals have the ability to make phone calls from prison (wouldn't
it be fun to get a phone call from the guy in prison who raped you?)
But more to the point: the primary idea behind throwing people in
prison, more than "punishment" or "rehabilitation", is protecting
society from these evil, twisted, sick bastards.  Letting them make
phone calls flies completely in the face of this.  They should not be
allowed to participate in the society that they have harmed - period.

I'll make one exemption to this: the prisoner must be allowed to
contact his/her legal representative (within reason).

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It is enshrined in the rules there in 
Canada, and that used to be the case here in the USA as well, at least
under the old system -- prior to 9-11-01. There are now hundreds of 
men locked up in USA jails whose only offense appears to be they are
 from the middle-east, or they 'appear' to be of some middle-east
nationality. Those are the guys I really feel bad about; in the wrong
place at the wrong time; now locked up until whenever, while the
police work hard trying to find something to pin on them. Of course,
Cook County Jail, Chicago, Illinois wasn't invented post 9-11. There
have been complaints about that place -- the largest  'jail' (i.e.
prison) in the world for many years -- to no avail. What's really
interesting to see is when someone who was *employed* there, winds up
as an inmate there. And that happens a lot also. It is a terribly
frightening place. And you would not be there if you were not already
guilty. Police make those decisions, and we all know they are very 
honorable, noble, fair and honest. If they had not thought you should
be there, you wouldn't be there. We know police don't make mistakes
or judge anyone unfairly! 

No Joey, the United States has pretty much given up on any pretenses
of 'innocent and worthy of rights, etc until proven guilty by a jury
of peers.' Police will tell you that sort of foolishness is not wanted
any longer here. And with thirty-plus 'actual' prisons already in
southern Illinois (250-400 miles south of Chicago), they are starting
to run out of places to build them. They may have to actually build
one or two new ones in Chicago. As it is, the Salvation Army operates
a half-dozen bus routes which run every weekend to the prisons, and
gives each bus rider (invariably black ladies; usually with their
babies, since the prisons in Illinois are 95 percent black and about 
90-95 percent Chicago residents) a sack lunch and milk for the babies,
etc. 

Three to four hour bus ride to get to the prisons, a three to four
hour bus ride back home, a *thirty minute* visiting time allowed when
there. It usually works out okay; now and again a bus full of black
ladies gets sidewiped on I-55 and everyone gets killed, as happened a
couple years ago at Christmas. When that happens the Chicago Tribune
tells about it in thick, bold headlines, then all gets back to
normal. The system seems to work okay, no complaints except from
young, very liberal social workers, some of whom are employed at Cook
County Jail; others are employed by Salvation Army.  But they soon
learn to shut up and go with the flow, at least the ones employed by
the jail. No, Joey, that old ridiculous concept (at least according to
police/prosecutors) of 'innocent until proven guilty' has no meaning
here in the United States any longer. I am *so glad* to be out of
Chicago, IL for good, permanently. The whole city and its political
structure has gotten so rotten.  PAT]

Doug Faunt, replying to a previous post on how internal numbering space
within Tokelau's country code +690 seems to have been 'hijacked' (or
freely given???) to tele-SLEAZE (!) wrote:

> I don't understand how a valid country code can be abused as you

In today's telephone (and business) environment, these things have
been allowed to happen. Unfortunately, international and domestic
government regulatory agencies just don't seem to have the time nor
desire to police or root out such abuses. To be fair to them in some
respect, sometimes they (regulatory) just don't have the resources
and/or jurisdiction to police it.

It *USED* to be that from the US (and Canada), virtually all calls to
a particular country code would be charged the same rate, depending on
the calling party's time/day and "rate plan". I could call any number
range within that country code, regardless of service (landline
vs. wireless) or geographic location within that country code, and be
billed the same rate. Of course, internal toll-free numbers and
internal PAY-per-call (usually SLEAZE) numbers within that country/
country-code, were either BLOCKED by AT&T and/or the domestic carrier
in that destination country, or else if allowed, I'd be billed a rate
no higher than to call "POTS" landline or cellular numbers anywhere
within that country / country code.

Even in the 1980's/90's, there have been exceptions here/there ...

+52 Mexico has always been distance-based rated, depending on the
destination Mexican domestic numbering/codes I dialed dialed ...

+53 Cuba was not dialable from the US via US-based carriers until the
mid-1990s, although the 'kludge' code of +53-99 for the US Military
base at Guantanamo Bay has been dialable (as 01(1)+53+99+) from the US
(ONLY) since the 1980's. And today, with +53 Cuba now dialable from
the US, I seem to think that the rates from the US to Cuba as +53 and
from the US to +53-99 Guantanamo Bay are *DIFFERENT*. In the 1980's, I
also think it still mattered on from where *within* the (continental)
US you were calling from when using AT&T IOC Operators to call Cuba,
as to the rate you were charged -- i.e., a call to Cuba from Florida
would be charged a different rate (probably less) than a call from
California to Cuba would be charged.

(NOTE - calls to the US Military Base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba from
non-US locations, INCLUDING from Canada and other [non-US] NANP points
apparantly can NOT be customer-dialed as +53-99-etc., but apparantly
must be OPERATOR HANDLED. I don't know if they have to conatact the
AT&T IOC in Pittsburgh -- or for that matter, ANY US-based AT&T OSPS
Operator -- or even if the operator in the calling country can
directly dial to +53-99, but I have read that the use of
+53-99-etc. for dialing directly to Guantanamo Bay in
customer-dialable ONLY from the *US*, and not even from Canada.)

In more recent years, overseas/international calls to points outside
of +1 (NANP) can have different rates to numbers within the same
country code depending on whether or not the destination number/number
range is landline or wireless/cellular... Or "personal" numbers
(similar to the +1-500 SAC fiasco in the US a few years ago). Domestic
calls to cellulars *within* that country are usually *VERY* expensive,
the calling party paying the "airtime" (mostly GRAVY for the telcos
and wireless providers).  And a vew years ago, they started demanding
that foreign overseas telcos and carriers pay this extra "gravy" on
calls to cellular originating from overseas.

In most (at least many) countries around the world, wireless service
is within its own area codes or numbering range. And these countries
have calling-party-pays (exhorbitant) airtime/toll/etc. "gravy" to
call cellular phones. And there are those trying to force this on
cellular and landline customers within in the US and Canada as well! :(

So now, depending on the carriers involved, it *might* now be possible
to call "900-like" numbers *within* a distant country/country-code,
not be blocked, and also be charged the expensive PAY-PAY-PAY-per-call
SLEAZE rate.

[on calling +690 Tokelau, in general]

> why does AT&T have this problem?

I don't know! :(

I think that even (US)Sprint-LD now allows calls to +690 Tokelau too.

It's a different world today, as I mentioned earlier. In today's
competitive environment, it could be that AT&T feels no real "incentive"
to set up dial-service to +690 Tokelau? How many people would "really"
be calling out there? Not that I agree with what AT&T is doing -- but
I'm guessing that maybe the SO CALLED "business realities" of today's of
today's telco industry is why AT&T doesn't offer service there???

And +690 Tokelau isn't the only location like this ...

I don't think that AT&T yet offers (dial) service to +670 East Timor.
Back in the 1970's, Portuguese Timor was separate from +62 Indonesia,
both telephonically and politically, and had its own Country Code
+672.  Eventually, Portugal pulled out of this colony/dependancy/
possesion (whatever its legal status was), and Timor became a part of
+62 Indonesia both politically/jurisdictionally as well as telephonically.

By 1984 the CCITT/ITU assigned +672 to "Australian External Territories".
(I don't understand WHY they had to get their own code, instead of
"sharing" from +61 Australia ... maybe there was some kind of routing
and/or rating reason?)

Also by 1984, +670 was assigned to the US possesion of Saipan/Mariana
Islands in the north Pacific. But in 1997/98 (and WITH advance notice),
Guam (+671) and Saipan/etc (+670) both became part of +1/NANP, as +1-671-
and +1-670 (respectively).

Since 1997 (and possibly earlier), there was a separatist movement in
"East Timor" (formerly Portuguese Timor). They eventually have
separated, but for an INTERIM time were reached through (ironically
their original country code) +672, but this time SHARING from number
space of Australia External Territories. I think that Australia helped
with investment and development of East Timor's new telephone
system. And then by 2000, +670 was (re) assigned (by the ITU), to the
new independent East Timor.

Even with various national and international standards bodies doing
what they could to inform the world telephone community that +670 is
now a valid country code for East Timor, and that Saipan/etc hasn't
been +670 since 1997 when it migrated into the NANP as +1-670-, there
are still either telcos/etc. who think +670 is still Saipan, or at
least don't yet recognize +670 for East Timor for customer dialing.

And I *THINK* that AT&T is one of these carriers. They don't "block"
(customer) dialed 01(1)+670-etc. in the originating 4ESS "as if" +670
was invalid, but they rather route it to a "vacant code" recording
from the 4ESS in Reno NV, that 4E was used in 1997/98 and for a few
years following to play the recording indicating that Guam and
Saipan/Mariana Islands were now dialed as 1+/0+ the 671/670 area code
etc., rather than as 01(1)+671/670-etc. if the customer happened to
still dial the call as an IDDD 011+ call.

But I also think that both MCI and (US)Sprint *DO* allow customer
dialing to +670 East Timor.

Similarly, +93 Afghanistan hasn't been customer dialable. (no surprise
there). But last year, after the US invasion, the telephone system has
been built up to SOME degree, and there is a domestic numbering
document for +93 Afghganistan at the ITU's website, see the following
set of URLs for further info:

http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/index.html
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/nnp/index.html
http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/number/a/afg/77447.html
http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/number/a/afg/77447_ww9.doc (English)
http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/number/a/afg/77447_ww9-fr.doc (Francais)
http://www.itu.int/itudoc/itu-t/number/a/afg/77447_ww9-es.doc (Espanol)

BTW, according to the page, the Afghanistan numbering document is dated
13-Jan-2003, a VERY recent revision!

I think that MCI and/or (US)Sprint now allow customer dial service to
+93 Afghanistan but not yet AT&T.

Then there's Easter Island, politically/jurisdictionally (as well as
telephonically) part of +56 Chile. Regular domestic dialing is available
between Easter Island and mainland Chile. Canada, Australia, NZ, the UK,
and other countries have customer-direct-dialing to Easter Island.
However, the last time I checked, AT&T in the US still treats Easter
Island as *OPERATOR HANDLED ONLY*, probably via the Pittsburgh IOC (unless
the regular AT&T OSPS Operator can call Chile's own Inward/IOC?). I'm not
exactly certain about the actual numbering for Easter Island. I've seen or
heard conflicting information as to what is dialed domestically within
Chile compared to what is dialed from Canada and other countries. 

I assume that AT&T blocks both formats for customer dialing from the
US. I don't know if MCI and (US)Sprint yet offer customer dial service
to Easter Island. Also, the *rates* to Easter Island via AT&T (using
Operator handled service) is quite expensive. Maybe because of the
*distance* that Easter Island is from the mainland, as well as a
different routing is the reason that Easter Island isn't yet customer
dialable from the US?  (But if MOBILE ranges in other countries now
have different rates and routes from the US, and if Guantanamo Bay
have been routed and rated differently than for Cuba even though both
use +53, then Easter Island "could" be made customer dialable from the
US via AT&T and ANY other carrier!)

There's also Western (formerly Spanish) Sahara on the west coast of
Africa, between +212 Morocco and +222 Mauritania. This area has been
in dispute between the two bordering countries for a number of
years. There is NO distinct country code for Western Sahara. I don't
know what its telephone situation (if it even exists) is like in
Western Sahara. The last time I checked (some years ago), from the US
(via AT&T), one had to have the call handed by the Pittsburgh IOC at
Operator Handled Rates.

There are a few other "obscure" and "special" areas of the world
and/or telephone country codes, such as +970 for Palestine, separate
from +972 for Israel. I think that AT&T *IS* routing calls to
Palestine when dialed as 01(1)+970-etc., but many local telcos haven't
yet opened up +970 as a valid country code in their end-office
translations or routings to the LD-Carrier.

There is +881 for Global Mobile Satellite (including Iridium and others).
And +882 for "Global Networks".

Both of these have WORKING networks and subscriber numbers. However,
many local telcos don't yet have +881 and/or +882 properly opened up.

Other "specialty country codes" include +800 for Universal
International Freefone Numbers" which has been operational for several
years now, but inconsistantly, and future codes for "personal numbers"
(a-la +1-500-) on +878, Shared Cost service on +808, PAY-PAY-PAY
'premium' (sleaze?) on +979, and something on +991 called
"International Telecommunications Public Correspondence Service".

I know that New Zealand has a degree of jurisdiction over Pitcairn
(with some jurisdiction/assistance/etc. also from Australia and the
UK). But the telephone system *on the island* is "fixed" InMarSat,
using Country Code +872 (for the Pacific).

BTW, +870 is to be the future "single code" for Mobile/Maritime
Satellite service. Presently, +871 is North Atlantic, +872 is Pacific,
+873 is the Indian Ocean, and +874 is the South Atlantic. You almost
have to "know in advance" in which part of the world the boat/ship or
plane will be in to know which +87X InMarSat "country" code to
use. However, the actual numbers are NOT re-used between individual
+87x codes, since the ship or plane is able to travel among all
ocean/code areas.

The ultimate use of the single +870 code is going to be somewhat like
"cellular roaming". You won't have to know "where" the vessel will be.
A 'location/roaming database' will probably be consulted to know which
satellite to route the call to.

Anyhow ... as for Pitcairn, from the "Pitcairn Island Web Site",
http://www.lareau.org/pitc.html
it mentions the InMarSat +872 phone and fax numbers on Pitcairn.

(Be advised that the cost to call InMarSat can be QUITE expensive, and
is not necessarily "discounted" on any international calling plans
with the major domestic carriers).

> These are not academic discussions, BTW.  I was considering going to

Well, PLEASE give us a report on the telephone service there! :-)

I know that Pitcairn used to have one or two magneto party line
systems for the residents to use amongst themselves, which could be
"patched in" to a radio-telephone system. If this magneto party-line
system still exists, I don't think that they can patch it into the
InMarSat terminals.  One on the island can place/receive calls via the
InMarSat system only at the InMarSat terminal phone on the island.

I wonder if AT&T's IOC in Pittsburgh has a way to reach Pitcairn via
the HF Radio system (maybe routed via New Zealand IOC/Inward?), if one
wants to be patched into the magneto party line to speak directly with
a specific resident? I seem to remember when I was doing some research
on the Pacific Ocean area's phone service back in 1997, that the AT&T
operator told me that Pitcairn could be dialed directly using +872
(Pacific) InMarSat at rates not set by AT&T but rather by the InMarSat
organization or its sub-contractor ... OR it could be AT&T IOC
Operator Handled.

I also wonder what the status of Wake and Midway presently are? I
understand that they are mostly "de-militarized" now and are mostly
'exotic' and remote 'tourist' locations. When the US Military was more
active with bases there, I understand that there were TWO ways one could
place calls to Wake and Midway ...

As an Operator Handled Call, where the calling party would call their
usual local originating Bell System (AT&T) or independent telco operator,
and ask for a number at Wake or Midway. The telco operator would then
call GTE's Hawaiian Telco "Inward" in Honolulu HI, Kp+808+121+St. 

GTE-Hawaii would know the routing instructions from there -- probably
similar to a ring-down or "toll station". For *BILLING* identification
purposes (only, and NOT for customer nor even operator 'dialing'
purposes), the "mark-sense" code for Wake was/is (+1)808-998 and for
Midway was/is (+1)808-999.

The other way to reach Wake or Midway not too long ago was if you knew
the upfront +1-808-NXX- series for the US Military at Pearl Harbor
HI. I was told that a customer could "direct dial" to Wake/Midway "as
if" they were calling the Centrex or PBX at Pearl Harbor/Honolulu HI,
if they knew about it and the proper number range. The call would be
billed at rates for a customer-dialed call to Honolulu HI, "as if" the
base phone system at Wake/Midway were simply FX'd off Pearl Harbor,
Honolulu HI.

So, if you do make it to Pitcairn and back, please inform us about the
phone system! :-) Try to find out if the magneto party line system for
the island residents' own use still exists, and if it can be "patched"
into a 'traditional' two-way radio-telephone hookup!

That is why I gave a huge Y-A-W-N when ATT offered GPRS.  I'll stick with

Except I did not stereotype all death row inmates.  I did pointed out
that the ones I was mentioning are convicted murderers, which is a
plain fact, not a stereotype. By contrast, Mr. Ryan overruled juries
and judges in every case and there is nothing more arbitrary than
that.  If he cared so much about the poor murderers he commuted, he
just damned them instead because he robbed them of the appellate
review they had coming. 

Clearly that does not bother you.  Were you opposed when Mr. John
Wayne Gacy was sentenced to death in Illinois, a well-liked murderer
who had brutally entrapped and murdered scores of vulnerable young
boys, then disposed of their body parts?  Are you opposed to the drive
by murderers involved in last year's serial killings in the metro
Washington area receiving a sentence to die, a sentence much more
humane then their own killings?  Or did you have tears to shed for
poor Mr. McVeigh who horribly mass killed hundreds of innocent
victims, and destroyed the lives of their surviving family members
forever?

I *NEVER* said anything of the sort.  You put those words there and
attack what I did not write.  I did point out if they are truly
innocent, then robbing EVERY one of them (those who were commuted in
IL) of their appellate review across the board without trial does not
do a damned thing to help them, it just condemned them to prison in an
arbitrary manner.

No he didn't.  He found 4 men that may not be guilty.  I agree,
certainly they should not be killed.  But don't toss the baby away
with the bath water.  If DNA is strong enough to indicate those men
are indeed innocent, then it is strong enough to indicate those who
are guilty. The people he arbitrarily commuted will never get the
appeal that last week they still had waiting for them.  He overruled
scores and scores of juries, trials, and judges without any evidence
to suggest that there was a damn thing wrong with any of them.

"Despite ample claims to the contrary, researchers are now finding
that the death penalty is a deterrent. Researchers at Emory University
looked at nearly 6,000 death sentences and compared them to the murder
rates and likelihood of being sentenced to death in 3,000 counties. 
They found every execution saved as many as 18 would-be-murder
victims. Other studies done at the University of Colorado and the
University of Houston also found that executions saved lives."  -WSJ

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Normally, about this point, Ms. Davis,
I have to draw a line and ask the participants to move their debate to
private email. Since I am one of the more 'controversial characters'
around here I have to take my own medicine occassionally. But because 
I am the moderator here in this theoretically telecom-based newsgroup,
I try to be fair on 'controversial subjects' where I am an active
participant in the discussion. I try to think of myself as a 'user'
here, albiet a 'special' one, in charge of editing the messages and
presenting them. With the above in mind, I will make my final comments
on this topic 'in public' in the context of this message thread, I
will then allow you a final rebuttal (if you wish to write one) which
I will also publish, then, let's you and I take the entire thing to
private email. That's what I tell everyone else around here, and if
it were you and some third-party I would say it now, but I am
sensitive to the fact that Editor's Notes in effect get the final
word, and I don't wish to abuse my position here like that. So now,
here is my final word:

I do not *ever* support a *forced* death penalty (the kind where you
are led away then injected). I would support a *voluntary* death
penalty. If that sounds like an oxymoron, let me explain. After a
person crossed some arbitrarily defined point in society (either a 
henious murder, or similar, if *I* were the judge (which I never would
agree to be) then I would inform the person thus: "Mr. Gacy/McVeigh/
Whoever, it was the decision of the jury that you can no longer be
accepted as a member of society. They/we no longer feel any form of
rehabilitation for you is possible or desirable. You will be detained
in custody while YOU reach a decision; (1) if you feel, as most of us
would, that what remains of your lifetime is not worth living in the
confines of a prison, then YOU may ask the court to order your death.
You may choose the method of execution: firing squad, lethal injection,
electric chair, gas chamber, suicide, your choice. It will be a humane
and merciful and quick death. (2) if you prefer life in the hellish
confines of a prison, in effect afraid to face death and whatever that

the rest of your natural life (or maybe present age plus 40 years or
death, whichever comes first.) In any event, Mr. Gacy/McVeigh/whoever,
**you can no longer be a member of society**. Too many people have
been harmed by your life. You make the choice. We will give you thirty
days to reach a decison. If YOU choose to end your own life in the 
next thirty days, we will honor that decision. Our goal is not to seek
revenge and have a public spectacle of your death. No one is going to
guard you and keep you alive for thirty days in order to get the Last
Laugh by walking you the 'last mile' to the execution room. If it
gives you some dignity to end your own life voluntarily and not
force us to do it for you, then do so. After thirty days, if you have
not reached a decision or refuse to respond, then the court will order
your lifetime in prison. Most guys would be very afraid of that choice.
But the choice has to be yours alone, Mr. McVeigh/Gacy. To aid you in
reaching the best decision, your cell will have a telephone, which you
are free to use as you wish to talk to your lawyer, your family and
your friends. Use them to help you make this important decision. The
quickest way to get that telephone yanked out of the wall and pitched
in a trash can, Mr. McVeigh/Gacy, is to make any contact at all with
your victims and their families. Your phone calls will be free of
charge to you, but will be monitored to insure your compliance with
the 'no contact with victims' rule. Now go back to your cell, sir, and
reach your decision. We find the whole process to be most distasteful,
and we do not intend in any event to have a revenge-getting spectacle.
We do not 'take revenge', we simply reach decisions that are best for
society in general. Under extraordinary circumstances, your decision
can be extended for a single additional thirty day period, on request
of your attorney or family members, provided you agree to the single
time extension. You see, sir, the victims of your crimes also have
rights."

That, Ms. Davis, is how *I* would deal with it. Like the problem of
unwanted animals in the Independence Animal Shelter (maybe your town
as well?) being 'put to sleep' when the shelter gets overcrowded, what
to do about miscreants in our human society is a dreadful problem, and
at best, putting them to death is a shitty answer to a shitty problem. 
Something has to be done, and I think Governor Ryan made a difficult
choice under a shitty set of circumstances. That's what leaders do.

Your article was really very interesting and seemed very well documented.

However I think that when you say "there are those trying to force
this on celullar and landline customers within the US and Canada as
well!" is not completely exact. Long distance providers are not trying
to force US and Canadian customers to pay for the extra charge when
calling a cellular phone in a country.

In fact this is just that long distance providers need to have rates
reflecting the reality of the market.

Let's take for example the French market which is quite representative
of all European markets. 10 years ago there were no cellular phones in
France.  At that time there was only 1 rate per provider for calls to
France from the US. Cellular phones in France have a specific area
code (+336 is the code for all cellular phones in France, +331,+332,+333,
+334,+335 are the codes for landlines in France, and +338 is the code
for Non Geographic Numbers, premium numbers like the +1-900 numbers
and toll free numbers like the +1-800).

The business model of cellular phone providers in France is quite
different from the providers in the US since the cell-phone user does
not pay for the incoming calls while the person calling has to pay a
very expensive price to call the cell-phone user as you mentionned (a
regular local call with the French main carrier is $0.03 per minute
while a call to a cell-phone user is between $0.23 and $0.35 per
minute).

The reason is that the cellular phone providers take a very expensive
fee from any telco provider who wants to send traffic to cellular
phones. They don't care where the calls come from (local, national,
international) everyone must pay the high price to call a cellular
phone.

Ten years ago, with no cellular phones in France, that was not a
problem for US long distance providers and they just had one rate for
calls to France. Five years ago, I don't remember the exact figures but
there was certainly something like 10% of all lines in France that
were cellular phones so that was still not a problem for US long
distance providers since their rates were based on average calls. But
nowadays, there are as much cellular phone lines than landlines in
France.

So when a US customer calls to France he is more likely to call a
cellular phone than he was before: nearly 50% (in fact people prefer
to call landlines for their international calls so there are still
less calls to cellular phones). Since long distance providers all have
to pay the fees to the French cellular phone provider, either they
have to increase their average rate or they just split it in a lower
price for calls to landlines and a more expensive price for calls to
cellular phones. And that's what's currently happening.

And this is not limited to US and Canadian long distance customers. 
This applies to all long distance customers worldwide. When a French
customer wants to call a cellular phone in Germany, he has to pay a
higher price than if he were calling a landline.

I hope my explanation was clear.

For completeness I will fill in a bit more about East Timor. 

Following the seperatist elections a few years back they had another
'code' between the +670 and +672.

Between these the entire country was basically ravaged in a slash and
burn operation by the outgoing administration basically leaving no
communications.

Thus the Australian Army 'invaded' to bring law and order as a peace
keeping force. One of the first things that they set up was a phone
system. Telstra provided a cell phone system for the capital for the
use of the Army and others (Members of the Army were banned from
taking their personal cellphones though when they invaded).

Anyway the way the cell phone system was set up was to place the cell
site 'officially' in South Australia a few thousand miles to the south.
This meant that the country code was +61 for Australia, and the cell
site was in the South Australian area code of 08. All users of the
cell phone system would have used cell phones with one of the
Australian mobile prefixes -- such as +61417 +61418 or +61419 for
Telstra Mobile Phones.

Aparently the GSM cell site was linked by satellite from Australia.

Just to be clear, is the claim here that the sign can detect what
radio station I'm listening to?  It cannot.

At least, it cannot do so electrically or electronically.  I suppose
some method could be set up to see how drivers behave based on when
advertisements occur, but cars don't emit RF energy based on what
radio station is tuned.

Nope and nope.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Joe is 99 percent correct. The two 
exceptions I know of are when (1) your call is forwarded to a non-ESS type
switch. The 'ringing signal' and 'busy signal' sound 'different'. You 
have to be on ESS in order to subscribe to call-forwarding and the
other features like that. On ESS, the ring is different in the sense
it begins immediatly. With crossbar and stepping switches (are there
any of them left at all?) the ring is ever so slightly delayed in
starting, and the ringing cadence is ever so slightly different. So if
you are on an ESS (you would have to be, to enable/use the feature)
then if you forward to a number on the same switch you won't hear any
difference at all. If you forward to a number on a different ESS
switch it is hard for the caller to tell the difference. If you 
forward to a non-ESS number, the caller definitly knows the call is 
going off the switch it was aimed at. (2) If the call recipient has
forwarded to a long distance number, the caller can usually tell this
by the slight delay in the call getting set up. On forwarding to 
same-switch numbers, you can't notice any *audible* difference, which
is the only thing you can detect anyway. (3) if the recipient has 
forwarded to an international number, the caller can definitly notice
a different ringing cadence/busy signal, etc. Since most of our
readers are too young to remember stepping switches or crossbar
switches, they probably do not know what they sounded like and assume 
all call setups sounded like they do today. That's why Joe is 99
percent correct.  

Regards 'do not forward' instructions by the person placing the call
wasn't there a dialing prefix code at one time intended to accomplish
that?  Seems to me *03 or *07, something like that as part of the
dialing string was written up as a way to do that, but not to widely
implemented. 

Another thing of interest about call-forwarding, which depends on the
generics in the particular switch:  X forwards his phone to Y, then
later on Y forwards his phone to Z. In some generics, X reaches Y and
stops, ringing Y without regard to what that guy asked for. The idea
is, X only wanted his calls to go to Y, and no further. Calls directly
dialed into Y get forwarded to Z, as that subscriber requested. In
other generics, chain-forwarding applies, and X will 'make the trip'
all the way to Z, or if Z has forwarded on to A, B, or C then X will
keep on 'making the trip' until it gets to the end of the line. Part
of the rationale also was to (1) eliminate the possibility of an
endless loop, where X forwards to Y, Y to Z, then Z back to X, and
the phones kept forwarding infinitly, never ceasing until all the
circuits in the central office or trunks between offices were all in
use. The other rationale was a bit more mercenary:  X forwards to
local number Y and Y forwards to [local to him, Z] however Z is not
local to X. Now X avoids a toll call when trying to reach Z. 

I had a case like that back in 1974 when Chicago first got ESS in
the WABash CO downtown. Getting cut from stepping switch to ESS
overnight (bypassing panel and x-bar totally in the process, that's
how old WABash was to begin with) was a cultural shock to start with,
but we immediatly started playing games with ESS and call-forwarding
to learn what we could do. My audiotext service on 312-HARrison 7-1234
was quite popular (several thousand calls each day) and one of my
regular user/listeners volunteered to help me. He lived in Joliet, IL
and like me at home had 'extended unlimited call pack' on his 
residential phone line. Joliet, in that little corner of the 815
area also offered unlimited/extended call pack entitling one to
call all over in the 312 area for units (non-coin-rated) charges only.
He volunteered to put a second phone line in his house, and leave
his first line *permanently on call forwarding to 312-427-1234* for
me. (The second line was so he could receive incoming calls for
himself. He made his personal (outgoing calls) on the extended
unlimited call pack line. By turning off the bell on his first line,
he was not annoyed by the frequent ringing at all times of the
day and night. (Call forwarding makes your phone ring one time, as
a 'reminder' to turn it off when you are at home.) Now my audiotext
phone service could get local phone calls not only from Chicago
area residents at no charge but also from anyone in the local to
Joliet area who dialed that 815-727-xxxx number. 

What caused the tandems to collapse, so to speak was I forgot that 
Illinois Bell also loved to listen to my daily three minute recorded
screed. (With what I had to pay for a couple dozen lines in a hunt
group and the associated recorded message equipment for each line
[you got it *all* from Ma Bell in those days] I was one of their
'better' small business customers.) With all that equipment and 
several thousand incoming calls each day which earned message units
for Mother, I should have known they would enjoy listening to me 
every day also. One day I concluded by announcing on the recorded
message, "if you are not in Chicago, you can listen to this message
by asking your operator for 'Enterprise 5468' or in the Joliet local
calling area at 815-727-xxxx.". As the Information Operator would 
say,  Bell decided to 'please make a note of that number'. The
Enterprise number was fine with Bell, since that was their tariffed
offering prior to 800 'toll-free' service. But 815-727, that was
being a bad dog!  I got a call the next day on my personal line in the
audiotext office (WEbster-9-4600) and told 'it' (the permanently
call-forwarded residential rated extended unlimited line) was being
turned off. I also got a phone call the same day from my friend in 
Joliet who said the business office had called him also and reamed
his back orifice out properly, and warned him against doing that
any further. So I had to get my Enterprise number expanded to include
the Joliet and Crystal/Fox Lakes areas of 815 as well as the
northern Indiana portion of 219 which I already had anyway. As Ma
Bell explained to me, 'we know best'.  PAT]

Pat,

ANI reports the called number and origination point.  There is no
information regarding the identity of the caller.  I used to have to
pour through megabytes of ANI information on the 800 number lines we
had to verify the number of times a caller stated they called and the
number of times they actually called.  (The inflation rate of
perceived vs. actual calls was never less than 400%. - And to do the
calling, I had to have at least the entire 10 digit number so I could
sort the database by originating number by date and time.  That was
the only way you could find a business with multiple outbound lines.)

The ANI data delivered along with a call is often used to form a query
into a database the holder of the number builds with customer
information.  If you have called before from that number and you are
in the company's database, they can greet you by name and have an idea
about the services you have requested in the past.  A great example is
(was)Domino's Pizza.  They track the number and the order.  As you
have to give a delivery address Domino's can then target special
coupons for pizza and other items you may want to buy based on your
past preferences.  They can also build demographic data and know what
to feature in their television and print ads for a specific area.

So, if you call a company on their toll-free with your TracPhone (or
even your own land line) does the company get your name and address?
No, they don't.  They do get the originating telephone number, the
name of the city and state where the call originated and the time and
length of the call.  ANI is not Caller ID.  ANI cannot be blocked --
it's billing information the holder of the toll-free number is
entitled to (they ARE paying for the call) and does not have any
personal information regarding the billing name or directory name and
address of that number.  The only people with a "magic" database that
gives names and addresses for all callers are those associated with
emergency public safety numbers.  When you call 9-1-1 as an example,
the ANI data does a "database dip" and returns the location and
billing name for that telephone number.  In the case of cell phones,
you pretty much get "Wireless Call" or Carrier Name on the display.

Not unless they already have your wireless number associated with your
name and address by virtue of you having an account with them, etc.

Besides, businesses won't even always get your number via *ANI* as
wireless ANI is wildly inconsistent; some wireless carrier switches
send customers' actual wireless numbers as ANI, while others send
"trunk" numbers that have nothing at all to do with the customer --
and may not even be in the same state as the wireless customer's phone
number, home, or office, or where the customer is physically located
when they make the call.

My favorite example of the latter:  one very small, rather unusual,
rural wireless carrier sends a Yuma, **Arizona** number -- which just
happens to be the carrier's roamer access number -- as BOTH CALLER ID
AND ANI on any and all calls placed from a town it serves in rural
northeastern **Tennessee**!  (The carrier actually backhauls its lone
cell site in that town -- and cell sites in other areas in at least a
half-dozen other states -- all the way to Yuma ...)  Caller ID name for
such calls (assuming the LEC serving the called party is Qwest, or has
access to Qwest's name database like BellSouth does) is the name of
the carrier, of course ... ;)

Subject: Re: Illinois Death Row is Empty Today


PAT - 

I have a solution to the problem of Capital Punishment.

When the prosecution intends to seek Capital Punishment, they are
required to state this at the beginning of the trial.  My proposal is
quite simple: The person who makes the declaration is noted by the
court as the "Responsible Prosecutor" ("RP").  The RP must take an
active and leading role in the prosecution of the case -- if they do
not, the court will declare a more appropriate RP.  In the event that
the accused is convicted and later exonerated, the RP is required to
serve the accused's entire (not remaining) sentence.  This requirement
holds in all capital cases, even if the punishment is not capital in
nature.  (Exoneration, by the way, means that they are proved NOT TO
HAVE COMMITTED the crime.  "Getting off on a technicality" does not
kick in the RP rule.)

Example: John Doe stands accused of murdering his neighbor.  Jane Roe
of the Prosecutor's office announces to the court that they intend to
seek Capital Punishment for this crime.  John is convicted on the
basis of his having been in a long-standing feud with the neighbor and
having stated publicly an intent to kill them.  A search of John's
house turns up a photograph of John, standing in his living room,
smiling broadly and holding a pistol of the caliber used in the
killing.  John is sentenced to 25 years because the murder weapon
can't be found.  Ten years later, a cop's son comes forward and says
his recently-deceased father confessed to having shot the neighbor
while cleaning his gun.

The cop's son produces the gun which ballistics tests show is the
murder weapon.  An investigation (using newly-developed computer
analysis not available at the time of the trial) shows that detectives
"Photoshopped" the picture.  John is immediately released, and Jane
must serve 25 years behind bars.  (What happens to the detectives is a
separate issue that can be handled under existing laws.)

Had John received the death penalty, Jane would be subject to
execution even if John had not yet been executed.

My suggestion (which I realize will NEVER happen) keeps Capital
Punishment available but discourages its use in all but the most
airtight cases.

     Yes, that's really my email address.  Don't change it.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Thanks for another good suggestion on
ways to handle capital punishment cases. I've heard so many sides to
the arguments for and against capital  punishment. Truly, it does
deter; the punished person won't commit any further crimes, capital
in nature or otherwise. It does not seem to deter anyone else however.
As Ms. Davis pointed out in her item yesterday some magazines and
newspapers and university studies believe it is a deterrent. But I
don't think there are that many pre-meditated, deliberate, willful
murders, at least relative to the total body count. Deterrance only
counts if the action is something you can and do conciously choose 
to avoid having happen. If you can freely choose to not give in to
your urges, desires, etc then deterrance (as a result of seeing the
thing that happened to a capitally-punished person, i.e. their death)
can be used as a reason for advancing capital punishment. Deterrant
might be true in the case of McVeigh, but I am not sure.  

In the case of John Wayne Gacy deterrant would not be useful at all. (As
an aside, would you believe; really believe! he was a neighbor of mine
when we both lived years ago in the Rogers Park neighborhood in
Chicago? He actually came out and gave us a bid on the rebuilding of a
cement sidewalk behind my house. He was a contractor/construction guy
by trade.) Poor John ... how could *anyone* be that twisted and mixed
up mentally?  Trying to deter him from raping and killing little boys
by him seeing an example of what happened to guys who did that sort of
thing (news reports on other killers 'getting the chair', etc) would
have about as much effect on him as telling a male dog not to mount a
female dog in heat. Sexual urges will not be trifled with. That sort
of urge is *very difficult* to deal with, and almost impossible to
'cure'.

Ditto with Larry Eyler (another former neighbor in Rogers Park; he
lived less than a block away, on Fargo Street by the lake, in 1983,
ony a few years after Gacy lived in the same area.) Eyler, along with
his lover, the professor of library science and Librarian at Indiana
State University in Terre Haute, IN were both heavily into a scene
where they lured young guys from the bus station in Terre Haute out to
the professor's home and 'imposed' on them. When the heat got on Larry
Eyler, the professor moved Larry to Chicago, after Larry had serially
murdered several guys around Indiana. The icing on the cake however
happened when Larry, not content to merely serial-murder all the young
guys he and the professor cruised at the bus station in Terre Haute,
invited the professor to join him over Labor Day weekend in Chicago
when Larry brought the 'guest of honor', a fifteen year old male
prostitute home for the two of them, they proceeded to murder the boy
as well, and dispose of his totally dismembered body in dumpster
wagons in the alley behind Larry's new apartment in Rogers Park. What
kind of deterrant would stop two men from acting out their sexual
fantasies like that?  What worked in the professor's case was the
prosecutor cut him a deal; snitch on Larry so we can gas him, we will
let you walk. And it worked. Larry died of AIDS in prison in Illinois
before the state got the chance to inject him; his lover the professor
got off the hook entirely, although his university employer in Terre
Haute looked sort of askance at the whole lurid mess and told him get
a job somewhere else. I really have to wonder if Ms. Davis feels that
deterrent would have worked in their case either. Poor Larry, what 
made him act like that?

Or what about that cannibal up in Milwaukee (his name escapes me right
now; the guy who picked up young black guys in Chicago and took to his
home in Milwaukee where he cooked them and ate them following sex.)
When police *finally, eventually* heeded the neighbor's complaints 
about the guy (after he had acted out like that several times), the
police got to his apartment and found four human heads on platters in
the refrigerator and one headless body with maggots all over it upside
down in a big barrel in the bedroom. In the kitchen by the microwave
was a plate with an arm and a jar of mustard.  He had planned to 'eat
that later' when he got hungry again. One police officer on the scene
had to be excused while he went out on the back porch to vomit and
get a breath of fresh air. He died in prison also, but not by the
official and approved method. A couple of the Brothers killed him in
the prison laundry room. Poor guy, *what* got his mind so twisted?
How would publicity about capital punishment have ever deterred him
 from such evil acts?  Very simple, it wouldn't have. Serial killers
with sexual desires will never be stopped nor prevented. To be sure,
capital punishment deterred those three from continuing their evil
acts. But obviously none of the 1736 men on the nation's death rows
were very impressed.

Subject: Calling Party Pays to Call Cellular


I originally wrote in "Tokelau, Pitcairn and Other Obscure Places",
regarding different rates to call wireless phones domestically within
a country, as well as now to call wireless phones in that destination
country but originated from outside of that country:

> And there are those trying to force this on cellular and landline

Then Herve Andrieu <andrieu@3u.net> replied:

Well, while my personal opinion is that the extra charge to call
cellulars within those (non-NANP) countries as well as now charging
NANP (US/Canadian) callers to call cellulars/wireless in those
countries, is JUST PLAIN AND PURE "GRAVY" for the
telcos/carriers/wireless providers, my phrase:

"And there are those trying to force this on cellular and landline
customers within in the US and Canada as well! :("

does not really refer to charges on US/Canadian (landline or wireless)
callers who are calling cellulars/wireless in non-NANP locations.

No, here in the US and Canada, cellular/wireless/etc. is part of the
landline numbering space. Most all wireless service in the US/Canada
uses numbering/codes based on already existing tariffed
ratecenter/exchange rate areas.

If a cellular phone is based in the New Orleans rate area, it is a
LOCAL call for me to call it from a landline or a cellular based in
New Orleans.  (Of course, I will might have to pay some form of
outbound airtime if calling FROM a local cellular). But in MOST of the
US and ALL of Canada, LOCAL calls do NOT cost (landline) customers any
form of per-minute, per-call, per-mile charges. We pay a fixed monthly
fee for telephone service (dialtone) and get a certain block of
exchanges/prefixes/regions that we can call "unlimited". Sometimes,
there are several different "tiers" or "bands" which one can
optionally subscribe to (at a higher monthly fee) to get an even
larger region of unlimited calling which would otherwise be
per-call/mile/minute "toll".

And calls to cellular phones based outside of our local calling area
are billed at normal long-distance/toll rates, depending on our plan
with our long-distance provider.

What I was referring to as "those trying to force this (caller-pays
extra airtime charges) on us in the US/Canada" has to do with
proposals (which hopefully will FAIL) to force "European/rest-of-
the-word" type cellular billing on US/Canada landline (and the calling
side of cellular) customers for local/domestic-toll calling *WITHIN*
the NANP (US/Canada).

*IF* this were ever to happen, there would be no 'easy' way for one to
know if one is calling something locally and "free" (landline) or if
there will be huge charges to something that has a "local
ratecenter/exchange area" NPA-NXX type code but is expensive because
it is a cellular phone!  :(

FOR THE MOST PART, cellular/wireless numbers *do* have dedicated NXX
c.o.codes, but they are *within* standard NPA (area) codes. AND, we
don't have "dedicated" cellular area codes or any dedicated partition
of numbering for cellular. And I for one am glad that we don't!

The FCC stated some years back that 'dedicated' area codes or
numbering at that level strictly for cellular/etc. is "discriminatory". 
And if EVER portability really gets extended to cellulars, my
understanding is that not only would one be able to port their
cellular number amongst different cellular providers, but also be able
to port a number between landline and cellular! Thus a single NPA-NXX
code could have wireless and landline -xxxx line-numbers all
intermixed!

There *ARE* examples (from the 1980's and earlier) of old-style mobile
and AMPS cellular numbers "sharing" from a prefix already having
landline numbers. Those were usually in specific "thousands"
blocks. But even then, most billing software and routing didn't go
down to the "thousands" level.

And if the intended portability ever comes about, there wouldn't even
be separate thousands blocks to differentiate between celllular and
landline.

Most cellular providers in the US and Canada now have all kinds of
airtime/roaming/Long-Distance package plans, so the thought of making
the CALLING party pay EXTRA just because the destination number is a
cellular will be just pure GREED on the part of the cellular provider
(and telcos too, since they are really the same companies). And I
still think that this pure gravy/greed applies to other countries as
well, especially when calling to a cellular in another country when
calling from the NANP. But I rarely if ever make any 011+ calls to
non-NANP points anymore, so it isn't really an immediate concern to me
though!

Why not multi-boot? I forget how it works on XP but in 2000 you have
to install Linux first, then 2000 because you have to use MS boot
loader for Win2K.

Should work the same with XP.

Pat,  at the time of the "real address" I used, you appeared to be
opposed to any form of "munged" address, and I respected that. (Big
mistake, in retrospect -- that address is *doomed*, and will probably
be unusable forever!)

I've noticed that you seem to have relaxed somewhat in this regard,
and that was why I tried the "temporary address" approach this time.

Why not simply let the poster use his/her own favourite method for
dealing with their NG postings.  That places the resposibility
squarely on each poster's own shoulders, rather than yours.  After
all, we all know that posting on an NG carries spam risks, no matter
what NG it is, and we have all pretty much worked out how we want to
deal with the problem.

I've  had great  success (so far)  with the commonly used "munge"
method that has a footnote on the lines of "replace XXXX with YYYY to
reply by e-mail"  I've used this method for quite a while, in a
number of NGs, and I have yet to receive a single spam as a result (I
can tell by the address used -- I use a range of addresses, and am
fortunate to be able to chop and change as I wish, and also discard a
given address if it gets compromised). Real People appear to be
able to "decypher" without any problems, but the spammers seem to be
using automated methods that can't resolve a munged address.

Unfortunately, the onus of "media concentration" is dissapating. 
Language from the commission has crept in to the effect that since there 
is robust competition from alternative media (e.g. the Internet, etc.), 
concentration of ownership of radio and TV doesn't wield the power that 
it used to. 

I, personally, feel this is bogus, but watch carefully as the FCC in 
coming months softens considerably its stand on traditional media 
concentration. There are also conglomeration apologists who maintain 
that concentration of ownership does not necessarily mean lack of 
diversity. 

Recently, a spokesman for the NAB (dubbed by many of us in the industry 
as "not about broadcasting") declared that since the relaxation of 
ownership rules, there is MORE diversity in broadcasting. I'm not sure 
what he was smoking.

In San Diego, there are fifteen Clear Channel stations. A number of
those are in Mexico, just over the border ... and exempt from the FCC
rules. It is one of the most wretched radio markets in the country.
Without any meaningful competition, the stations just grind out
generic crap because they know they don't have to split the
advertising pie with anyone but themselves. This is a clear indicator
of what we can expect should the FCC relax its restrictions on

Subject: Telephone Scam


Found this article printed in a local neighborhood newspaper in
the Vancouver, BC area.  Port Moody is a small municipality at
the east end of Burrard Inlet (Vancouver Harbor) which was for a
few years the original terminus of Canada'a first transcontinental
railway.  It is primarily a bedroom community with its own police
force.

The newspaper has a web site,

http://www.thenownews.com/index.html

but this article was not available online.  A scanned complete
copy is available at

http://members.shaw.ca/nospam4me/telescam.html

I contacted the reporter via Email to ask if the rate of CAN$2,425 per
minute (approx. US$1,500) was accurate but after one day received no
reply.  This rate must be a typo, the telephone company wouldn't pass
such a high rate through to the customer would they?

        ===================

Beware of latest telephone scam

By Leneen Robb, Staff Reporter, Coquitlam Now

Port Moody Police are warning residents to be aware of the latest
telephone scam.

Const. Brian Soles said the scam begins when residents receive
a message on their answering machine or pager asking them to
call a number beginning with area code 809, 284 or 876.

"The reason you are given to make this call varies," Soles said.

"It can be to receive information about a family member who has
been ill, to tell you that someone has been arrested, died, you've
won a lottery price, etc."

"If you place the call, you will get a long recorded message, or be
kept on the line for some other reason."

"The call will be billed to you at $2,425 per minute."

Soles said the area codes are located in the British Virgin Island
and Bahamas.

The codes can be used as pay-per-call numbers, similar to 900
numbers in Canada and the United States.

Shortly after sending in the original message received this reply from 
the reporter at the Coquitlam Now.

Hi,

Thanks for your inquiry. I double-checked our figure of $2,425 with the 
Port Moody Police today, and they tell me it is correct. I agree it's 
extremely high let's hope no one is taken in by this scam. Thanks again 
for taking the time to write in.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: This seems to be a case where the
kindly police officers once again do not know what they are talking
about (what else is old?) and the newspaper reporters serve as the
police cheering squad. It reminds me of that old make-believe scam
several years ago where people were paged and given a number to call
back in New York City which was an audiotext service which charged
a premium rate for using it. All these telecom managers in companies
were busy sending out memos warning their employees to not make calls
like that. We here at TELECOM Digest thoroughly debunked that rumor
when it was pointed out that premium charges do *not* carry across 
interlata lines. The *only* 'prefix' that carries a surcharge here
in the USA is areacode 900. Exchanges like 976, and 540 (in New York
for example) cost whatever they cost on local, intralata calls. Outside
of the LATA (or maybe areacode, I do not remember which for sure) the
call costs only what a call to that areacode/LATA would cost. Those
premium surcharge numbers are *only* for use in the local area. 

An example which was given back then in the Digest referred to (at 
the time) a very popular service for gay men in San Francisco, at
the number 415-976-GAYS. The proprietor of the service complained to
Pacific Bell that his lines were always jammed up, but his commissions
were zilch. That started happening once guys from out of state figured
out they could simply ignore the opening disclaimer message about a
two dollar charge for three minutes of hot, adult chat. Eventually the
phone company convinced AT&T and the other LD carriers to quit
connecting to 976 numbers for that reason. I think MCI was the first
LD carrier to quit connecting their customers with 976 numbers. The
Chicago area guys, for example, were getting connected for about 25
cents, the cost of a three minute LD call to the west coast.  Maybe
one of our San Francisco readers can tell us if 976-GAYS is still a
working number or not, or of the technicalities of collecting the 
surcharge via the phone bill was too difficult to overcome. In any
event, don't worry about additional surcharges when calling outside
your own state (or in most cases even your own area code). All you
have to pay is the toll charges. Ditto on international calls.  A
WARNING: I cannot say if this same thing applies in Canada as well,
but I think it does.  PAT]

        Federal Appeals Court Looks to California State Supreme Court

    SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Sex.Com
(http://www.sex.com) announced pivotal results today in the pending
Court decision against VeriSign (NASDAQ:VRSN).  With signs pointing
towards a win for Sex.Com, the Ninth U.S. Circuit of Appeals in San
Francisco has asked the state Supreme Court, the final authority on
California Law, to intervene and decide whether a domain name is
property that can be converted as well as guidance to assess damages
that might amount to $100 million.

    Attorneys for Gary Kremen, founder and chief executive officer of
Sex.Com, said the order, which recognizes domain names as a type of
property, was a step toward victory in the case.  The case involves
Kremen, VeriSign, formerly Network Solutions, Inc. (NSI), and Stephen
Cohen.

    VeriSign unilaterally took the Sex.Com domain name from Kremen
upon receiving a forged letter from Cohen, asking that Sex.Com be
transferred into his name.  Without verifying the authenticity of the
letter, NSI obligingly transferred the Sex.Com domain name into
Cohen's name, in which he proceeded to build a multi-million
international porn empire.  Kremen produced definitive proof of the
forgery and fraud, yet VeriSign refused to transfer back the
registration to Kremen.

Subject: Orange Battles Security Glitch on Microsoft Phone


LONDON, Jan 16 (Reuters) - French-owned mobile phone operator Orange
SA (SBF:ORA) said on Thursday it was working with U.S. software ally
Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) to solve what it called a "security
issue" on a jointly developed phone.

    The British-based mobile phone group stressed that the SPV (sound,
picture and video) phones, which use Microsoft software, were only at
risk if customers disabled a security function by using a process
explained by a Web site, www.register.co.uk.

    The problem hinges partly on so-called "digital signatures", which
can establish the authenticity as well as the designer of applications
available on the Internet.

    Orange said if the phone's security function was disabled,
customers might be able to download applications that could make their
SPV unstable. But it stressed that the disabling process took 20
minutes and would have to be repeated each time the phone was switched
on.

Subject: Slowed by a Flawed New Media Idea, AOL Hopes for Comeback


By STEVE LOHR

AOL Time Warner, the world's largest media company, stands today as a
casualty of the salesmanship of Stephen M. Case and the credulousness
of the Time Warner executives who bought into his sparkling vision of
synergies between the old media and the new.

Now, Mr. Case has resigned as the company's chairman, the vision has
dimmed and executives from the Time Warner side of the combined
business - filled with remorse if not resentment at having sold to
Mr. Case's America Online at the height of the Internet mania - face
the task alone of resuscitating the company.

The AOL online service was supposed to be the engine of growth for the
merged company, offering lucrative new ways to market the products of
Time Warner's sterling brands, from Time, People and Fortune to Warner
Brothers and CNN. It was meant to be the business equivalent of
pairing Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers: AOL would give Time Warner
sex, and Time Warner would give AOL class.

But nothing has turned out as planned. With online advertising in a
deep slump, online subscriber growth waning and lingering questions
about its accounting, AOL is an anchor dragging down the combined
company. Analysts say that its woes overshadow the generally strong
financial performance of the traditional media properties in the Time
Warner stable.

In England, where you are required to have a license for your TV, they
use RF sniffing vans to find TV sets.

There *may* be enough LO (local oscillator) leakage from a car radio
that a good spectrum analyzer could tell what station you are tuned
to.

Don't be too sure.  Unless they are well shielded radio receivers emit
a little bit of local oscillator signal, which can be picked up and
used to determine the frequency you are listening to.

I have read of TV survey companies driving around and detecting local
oscillator signals to determine which channels are being viewed in
homes.  I've also read that in England, where radio and TV reception
is taxed, the tax collectors can drive around and determine who is
running a receiver who has not paid the tax.  Then there are the cases
where someone can learn remotely what is being displayed on your
computer screen by detecting radio emissions from the monitor.

Are you telling us that decades of radio sniffing by the British post
office (to track down listening license scofflaws) has been nothing
but a fraud?

Actually, most consumer radios DO leak significant amounts of LO
signal, whose frequency is a function of the station to which the
radio is tuned. Trust me.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Not only that, John, but years ago when
tube-style radios were common, radio station pirates could make actual
broadcasting stations by using that IF (intermediate frequency) which
comes around 440 KC I think. They would get in the back of the radio,
clip the wire with the IF, attach it to an outside antenna, tune a few
of the trim pots to crank up the IF to around a tenth or a quarter of
a watt, then set the tuning dial on the front of the radio a little
bit and that radio would be talking maybe a quarter or half-mile away.
Bill Pfieffer came over to my house one day and did that. He even had
a better idea. He hooked the RF output to one side of an unused phone
pair. Then we took my portable radio and walked down the street for
close to a mile and whenever we held that little portable battery
operated up next to a telephone pole, we would hear that old junky
tube style radio back at my house. Yes indeed, receiving radios do
also transmit a little.   PAT]

It most certainly can, and that is how the sign works.  It detects
what radio station cars are listening to and adjusts the current ad to
the demographics of the radio station.  How does it do this?  By
receiving the leaked weak signals emitted by the car radio's local
oscillator and using software to compare them to area broadcasts of
each local radio station.  Radar detector detectors used where radar
detectors are illegal, and TV detectors used where TV's are taxed each
year (such as UK) operate on the same principle.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: And also see my message to John Higdon
in this same issue of the Digest. In the case especially of the old
style tube radios, the leak was not always all that weak. PAT]

graduate students, much of it is still on the hard drives, waiting to
be discovered by the machine's new owner.

In a new article in the engineering journal IEEE Security and Privacy,
Simson Garfinkel and Abhi Shelat describe how they went on a used hard
drive buying spree, and collected vast amounts of private information
in the process.

Garfinkel, author of several books on computer security, is working on
a doctorate in computer science at MIT. He and fellow graduate student
Shelat wondered whether people erased their hard drives before
reselling their PCs. ''I wanted to find out if this was a big problem
or not,'' said Garfinkel.

So Garfinkel and Shelat purchased 158 hard drives at swap meets and
used computer shops throughout the United States, and on the Internet
auction site eBay. They wound up with 129 drives that actually
worked. Then they used commonplace software tools to look for data on
the drives. They found everything from love letters to pornography
and, in one case, over 3,700 credit card numbers.

Subject: Yahoo Plans Big Expansion of Broadband


By SAUL HANSELL

Buoyed by its growing sales and profits, Yahoo is planning to take 
its high-speed Internet access service nationwide.

Yesterday, the big Internet portal announced better-than-expected 
financial results for the fourth quarter of 2002. It was able to 
expand its sales of online advertising, even as it added new services 
that generate monthly fees from users.

One of the fastest-growing of those services is high-speed, or
broadband, Internet access, which Yahoo now offers as a co-branded
service with SBC Communications, the phone company that serves about
one-third of the nation.

Subject: Telemundo's Tricky Transition


by Penelope Patsuris, 01.16.03, 11:00 AM ET

NEW YORK - With its October 2001 purchase of Telemundo, the number two
Spanish-language television network in the U.S., NBC made a $2.7
billion bet that the booming Hispanic population will deliver
blockbuster growth.

There's no question that the Hispanic market is the next big thing for
advertisers. Already 33 million strong, it's the fastest growing
population segment, and its buying power is growing 118% annually, far
faster than that of the general population. Despite the fact that the
group represents 13% of the population, advertisers spend only 2.4% of
their budgets targeting Hispanics.

The opportunity is clear, but it remains a challenge to determine what
media are most effective for advertisers that hunger for this
ballooning demographic -- and Spanish-language TV isn't necessarily
it.

The George Lopez show on Walt Disney's (nyse: DIS - news - people )
ABC illustrates the challenges facing Telemundo. The sitcom is a hit,
and it marks the start of Hispanic themed-shows' assimilation into
mainstream media, much the way NBC's Cosby show was a pioneer for
blacks on television. But the Lopez show underscores a crucial
fact -- as Hispanics become more assimilated, they will turn more to
mainstream media for their entertainment, and tune in less to
Spanish-language television.

Subject: 20-Year Extension of Existing Copyrights Is Upheld


By LINDA GREENHOUSE

WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 - The Supreme Court today upheld the 20-year
extension that Congress granted to all existing copyrights in 1998,
declaring that while the extension might have been bad policy, it fell
clearly within Congress's constitutional authority.

The 7-to-2 decision came in the court's most closely watched
intellectual property case in years, one with financial implications
in the billions of dollars. A major victory for the Hollywood studios
and other big corporate copyright holders that had lobbied strenuously
for the extension, the ruling had the effect of keeping the original
Mickey Mouse as well as other icons of mid-century American culture
from slipping into the public domain.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's majority opinion methodically dissected
and rejected the arguments that a coalition of Internet publishers and
other users of noncopyrighted material had marshaled against the
Copyright Term Extension Act. The dissenters were Justices John Paul
Stevens and Stephen G. Breyer.

The named plaintiff in the case was Eric Eldred, who wanted to publish
some Robert Frost poems. Other plaintiffs included a church choir
director; an orchestral sheet music company; a company that restores
old films; and Dover Publications, a publisher of books that have
passed into the public domain.

Subject: A Corporate Victory, but One That Raises Public Consciousness


By AMY HARMON

The Supreme Court's decision to uphold a 20-year extension on the
copyright term handed a major victory to the entertainment and
publishing industries, which stand to make billions of dollars by
keeping control over lucrative properties for up to 95 years.

But the public domain advocates who had challenged the constitution-
ality of the 1998 law might claim a measure of success in the court of
public opinion.

Both copyright holders and their opponents said the decision was 
likely to sharpen the increasingly contentious battle over how to 
balance the rights of copyright holders with the public interest at a 
time when digital technology offers new powers to both sides.

Subject: AT&T Broadband Users See 3rd E-Mail Shift


By Peter J. Howe, Globe Staff, 1/16/2003

In a move likely to anger thousands of its customers, AT&T Broadband 
confirmed yesterday that its recent acquisition by Comcast Corp. will 
force more than 200,000 New England cable Internet modem subscribers 
to get their third e-mail address in barely a year.

AT&T spokeswoman Jennifer L. Khoury said the company expects to begin 
making the switch from e-mail addresses ending in attbi.com to 
comcast.net starting in March. It will affect more than 2 million 
subscribers nationally. Mail sent to old attbi.com e-mail addresses 
may be forwarded to the new comcast.net addresses for as few as 60 
days before the attbi.com addresses are shut down, the company said.

Subscribers who were outraged last March over being forced to notify 
scores of friends, business associates, Internet newsletters, and 
online merchants when the company changed e-mail from mediaone.net to 
attbi.com blasted the latest planned switchover yesterday.

Subject: Keeping Tabs: A Two-Way Street


By WILL WADE

An ordinary day at the zoo for Timothy Neher was quickly turning
traumatic. "It was the first time I ever got to take out my niece and
nephew by myself," he remembers of the 1997 outing. "Everything was
fine until lunchtime. I glanced up at the menu at the snack bar; it
couldn't have been more than a few seconds, but when I looked down
they were gone."

His 5-year-old niece and 3-year-old nephew were nowhere in sight. "I 
felt that panicky feeling every parent dreads," Mr. Neher said.

Then the five-minute crisis was over. The children had wandered 
behind the snack stand. "When I took the kids home that night," he 
said, "I told their parents we'd had some excitement, but I'd come up 
with a great idea for a company."

Almost six years later, the company, Wherify Wireless in Redwood 
Shores, Calif., has produced the Personal Locator, a satellite-based 
tracking device intended to head off the kind of panic that Mr. Neher 
experienced.

Location-sensing technologies based on satellite-based systems or 
infrared tracking are not new. But design advances have made the 
components small enough to fit into hand-held units, or to be built 
into bracelets or backpacks, relaying information that can readily be 
monitored on the Web. Couple that with a more security-conscious 
world, and suddenly tracking systems seem to be everywhere, keeping 
tabs on the whereabouts of children, elderly relatives and even 
belongings - in addition, of course, to helping drivers, hikers and 
sailors find their way from point to point.

Third option: run one computer INSIDE of another.  Install Linux and

The case *WAS* airtight, as far as Jane knew.  I can see implementing
this *ONLY* if you can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Jane was
party to a fraudulent prosecution.  If the cops cook the evidence and
present it to her, and she doesn't know the evidence is cooked, then
why in hell should she be subject to frying in the chair?  How on

-- Joey Lindstrom
-- Telus Sucks http://www.telussucks.info

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Let me tell you how collusion between
police officers and prosecutors works, Joey. In 1982, I was the victim
of a robbery. A home invasion type thing. They suckered me with an
excuse into leaving my apartment for all of a minute; maybe two. They
worked quickly; when I went back in my place they had been there; an
Apple ][+ computer was missing. I notified the police, but managed
to retrieve the computer and cords and disk drives from where they had
stashed them in a vacant apartment in the building. The police officers
told me to go see the state's attorney on the day of the trial. When
I went in his office, a police officer was sitting there with him.

I had identified two of the guys who had been in on it (suckering me
to leave my apartment for a couple minutes). The police had arrested
them both in the hallway outside my apartment. *The other guys
involved in it (four in total) were no where to be found.*  The two 
the police had arrested did NOT have any of my stuff in their
possession.  The conversation with the prosecutor went like this:

(prosecutor):  did you see these two (arrested) guys in the hallway there?
(me)  Yes. 
(prosecutor):  what of your stuff was in their possesion?
(me)  Those two guys did not have any of it.
(prosecutor):  Do you know what that means? When we get into court and
               you give that testimony, the judge will cut them both
               loose. They'll walk out today. 

The prosecutor hangs his head, clucks his tongue, and says to the 
police officer, "would you please explain to Mr. Townson what we are
trying to accomplish here?"  With that, he got up and _left the room_.

The police officer said to me (once the prosecutor was out of the
room, he was smart enough to not be in the room while the cop was
talking to me) -- and I quote -- "do you want to see those niggers go
free?". I was a little shocked hearing that sort of thing, but decided
to continue listening. "You could get up in court and say what you
told us, and watch those vermin go free ... or you could lie about it.
Tell the judge you saw those two with one of the computer parts, lets
say the power cord. Then I can tell you they'll get two years IDOC
(Illinois Department of Corrections). That's how this judge works.
But dont use the word 'niggers' when we get in court. It has to appear
it is a fair trial." Then he shut up and made some sort of finger
motion, because the prosecutor came back in the room almost right
away. "Did you explain to Mr. Townson our objectives here?"  asked the
prosecutor.

The prosecutor was a smart man; he did not intend to leave himself
in any trickbag. I would have had to *prove* that he was part of
any conspiracy, that he knew what the police officer had said to me
and that he (prosecutor) had condoned perjury in the court. I told
the prosecutor I had decided not to prosecute the crime after all, and
excused myself, then left. Like many of the families of victims of 
the men on death row, I felt victimized twice also. Once by the
no-good guys who had come into my home and ripped me off; then a
second time by the police officer/prosecutor who had encouraged me
to get up and lie in court, 'so the niggers do not walk away without
punishment'. 

And if the police/prosecutor would encourage *me* to get up and commit
perjury over a lousy computer (since recovered) then what makes you
think they would not encourage perjury by a forensic technician who
was employed by the police or an outraged man whose wife had been
sexually assaulted or an angry mother whose little son had gotten
buggered on the way home from school one day?   

So Joey, how did your imaginary Jane know the case was cooked? Well,
if she had been a prosecutor in Chicago (or an evidence technician
in Oklahoma City named Joyce or God knows who in Detroit or New
York City, she'd know, believe me. Ms. Davis does not like the idea
of me sterotyping police, calling them evil intake agents for our
nation's correctional industry. So I won't call them that, I'll 
simply say alot/most of them leave much to be desired in the way of
decent understanding human beings. 

You see Joey, you're the one who needs the stiff drink tonight, not 
Gordon H. who you abused in your message. He lives around the
Chicago area like I used to; he knows how things work there.  PAT]

This aproach is actually the one used for a thousand years or so in
imperial China.  The magistrate who tried a case also served as (in
our terminology) superintendent of police, public prosecutor, and
jury.  He was also not only allowed but *encouraged* to use torture to
get a confession.  What prevented the grossest abuses was an intricate
system of oversight and a law that if the judge tortured or executed
someone who subsequently turned out to be innocent, the same
torture/method of execution would be inflicted on the judge.  On the
whole it worked very well.

Pat, the "problem" of a death row inmate more resembles the case of a
large, vicious dog, that had been running wild and attacking at
random.

"Society" seems to have no problem dealing with a vicious animal (who
won't get the benefit of judge and jury either) -- it ought not be any
more difficult to deal with a "human" who has, by his own actions,
voluntarily placed himself outside the norms of the society he lives
in.

there *must* be adequate safeguards, but sometimes there's Just No
Doubt at all, and society should be "relieved" of something
"unacceptable" ...

Subject: Forget Tin Cans, These Gizmos Improve Wi-Fi Trouble Spots


By WALTER S. MOSSBERG

The hottest technology in personal computing is wireless networking,
which allows users to share a high-speed Internet connection among
multiple computers without being tethered to wires or wall jacks.
Known as Wi-Fi, this wireless system is commonly used to connect
computers in various rooms of a home, but it's also popping up in
public places like airports, hotel lobbies and coffee shops.

But there's a problem with Wi-Fi: In most homes, the wireless Internet
signal doesn't extend to rooms far from the base station, or access
point, which transmits the Internet signal. Even if the signal gets to
a distant room, it can be weak or fade in and out, making for a slow
and unreliable connection.

Unfortunately, there are few simple, ready-made solutions for these
reception problems. If you're a techie or a do-it-yourselfer, you can
go online and learn how to rig up more-powerful antennas, using such
things as surplus Russian military gear and even empty cans from
Pringles potato chips. But it's complicated.

One maker of Wi-Fi gear, Linksys, has just introduced a special
component that boosts the wireless signal, but it works only if you
have certain Linksys base-station models.

Excerpt from
Rupert Goodwins' Diary
17:22 Friday 10th January 2003

http://comment.zdnet.co.uk/story/0,,t479-s2128519,00.html

The next time I looked at the phone it appeared to have turned itself
off -- so I tried switching it on again. When it eventually came to
life I could not get it to dial -- a closer examination revealed the
legend 'Radio off' displayed very legibly on the SPV's excellent
screen. No amount of menu searching let me find anything that would
turn the phone's radio back on. At this point I remember making a few
comments about the dubiousness of Bill Gates' parentage. I eventually
managed to flag down a passing skier who let me use her Nokia phone
(which switched on immediately) to call for help. Later analysis
revealed that the problem arose because of the SPV's implementation
of the ON/OFF button. It needs to be depressed for a couple of
seconds to function as an on/off switch. If pressed and released
briefly it summons a 'QuickList' menu -- where one of the items lets
you turn the radio -- presumably to let you watch movies on the thing
when airborne on something more reliable than two planks of wood.

My conclusion is that during my attempts to switch the phone on I must
have inadvertently selected the QuickList menu and then selected the
Radio off item. It took quite a bit of frustrating exploration to find
the QuickList menu again -- so I was without the use of the SPV for
another day or so."

So there you go: if you must place yourself in life-threatening
situations with a modern information appliance as your only hope of
rescue, don't pick something with an obscure user interface.

Subject: Phone Units Join in Effort for Seamless Wireless Net


By BARNABY J. FEDER

Motorola, Proxim and Avaya are expected to announce today that they
will jointly develop technology to allow wireless communications to
jump between networks without interruption.

If the three companies are successful, an executive could begin
downloading data using a wireless hub in a Starbucks, airport or other
public site and move to a company office without interrupting the
transfer. Similarly, a phone call that began over a company's internal
voice-over-Internet network could move to a public carrier as the user
of the cellphone left the building.

Analysts briefed on the plans said the partnership would face daunting
technical hurdles, including reconciling the different security levels
and frequency levels in different wireless networks.  Analysts called
it the most ambitious wireless roaming plan yet to try to take
advantage of the spread of communication hubs based on a standard
called 802.11, known as Wi-Fi. The hubs, also called hot spots, are
either free to any user of a mobile device with a Wi-Fi card who
happens to be in the neighborhood or are limited to subscribers,
depending on who operates them.

Most Wi-Fi networks have focused on transfer of e-mail messages and
other forms of data from laptop computers but the goal of the three
companies is to offer seamless transitions to cellphone users as well.

Subject: Getting Onto the Internet at 30,000 Feet or So


By EDWARD WONG

For many air travelers, flying has become an escape from the 
modern-day cyclone of phone calls, e-mail and instant text messages.

But some of the world's largest airlines are now rolling out 
technology that allows passengers to surf the Internet, check e-mail 
and beam text messages to the ground.

Lufthansa Airlines, the German carrier, begins flying a Boeing 
747-400 today between Frankfurt and Washington outfitted with 
Internet connectivity developed by the Boeing Company. Next month, 
British Airways plans to start a trial flight with the same 
technology between London and New York. Japan Airlines and SAS, the 
Scandinavian carrier, have signed contracts with Boeing to outfit 
nearly a dozen planes each to offer Internet service next year.

Later this month, Cathay Pacific, the airline based in Hong Kong, 
will offer e-mail service on 40 planes using technology developed by 
Tenzing Communications, a small company based in Seattle that is 
partly owned by Airbus, Boeing's rival.

Another system, jointly developed by Tenzing and a company called 
ARINC, is already being used by Virgin Atlantic Airways, which has 
four planes that allow travelers to send brief text messages - at 
$2.50 each - that are typed out on video screens on the backs of 
seats. Virgin has a contract to install the system on its entire 
fleet by year's end; the technology has also been tested by Air 
Canada and Singapore Airlines.

The big question is whether passengers - especially business 
travelers - will pay to plug into the digital grid at 30,000 feet.

Those airlines that use Boeing's service, called Connexion by Boeing, 
expect to charge passengers $30 to $35 a piece for unlimited Internet 
access. Tenzing executives said airlines carrying its e-mail system, 
which does not allow Internet surfing, were expected to charge $10 to 
$20.

In the latest bit of DMCA lunacy, copyright guru David Nimmer turned
me onto a case that his firm is defending, where a garage door opener
company (The Chamberlain Group) has leveled a DMCA claim (among other

Yet another case where the anti-circumvention provisions of the DMCA
are being used to impede legitimate competition, similar to the
Lexmark case. Not, I think, what Congress had in mind when enacting
the DMCA.

  Subject: The Growth of an American Surveillance Society.

Declan,

I thought politechers would like to know about a new ACLU report,
"Bigger Monster, Weaker Chains: The Growth of an American Surveillance
Society."

This report grew out of our sense here at the ACLU that in order to
make progress on the privacy issue, we have to shift the terms of the
debate.  When viewed in isolation, many new privacy invasions seem
harmless to many Americans, who don't see why they should care that
(for example) someone is recording the date and time that they drive
through a tollbooth.  To understand the privacy issue one has to look
at the big picture to understand that each new piece of information
collected about us, no matter how seemingly harmless, is increasingly
being added together with thousands of other data points to create an
extremely intrusive, high-resolution picture of our lives.

The need to shift the terms of the debate on privacy to focus more on
the big picture was made a lot easier by the breaking of the story of
the Pentagon/Poindexter Total Information Awareness program and that
story has provided the perfect opportunity to try to spark a broader
discussion of how we are going to handle all the intrusive new
technologies that are being developed, and what we are going to let
this country turn into.

The report is available on-line at http://www.aclu.org/Privacy/Privacy.cfm?ID=11573&c=39.

Subject: Bouncing Signals Push the Limits of Bandwidth


By IAN AUSTEN

IT is a phenomenon well known to people who drive through urban 
high-rise canyons. Just as you stop at a traffic light, the car radio 
loses its signal. Once the light turns green, the car only has to 
creep forward a few feet to restore the radio reception.

Those dead spots, which can also cut off cellphone calls and mobile
computer communications, are often caused when signals bounce wildly
off the surrounding buildings. This scattering creates pockets in
which two reflections of the same signal collide and cancel each other
out.

Avoiding the undesirable effects of multipath, as this scattering
effect is formally known, has long been a preoccupation of people who
design wireless communications systems. Now, however, a system
developed by Bell Labs actually embraces radio reflections not only to
improve reception but also to boost the speed of wireless
networks. Prototypes of the system, called Blast, can send data over
third-generation, or 3G, cellphone networks at rates about eight times
those of 3G.

BUSINESS EUROPE

Mobile Operators' Regulatory Time Bomb
By LEONARD WAVERMAN

The U.K.'s competition regulator is in danger of deciding that
Europe's decade of success in the mobile-phone business was a
mistake. It would like to turn back the clock, or at least make
Europe's wireless industry look a lot more like the far
less-successful American mobile-phone business.

There are innumerable differences between the U.S. and European
mobile-phone markets, many of which contribute in one way or another
to Europe's greater success in the mobile-telephony business. But one
of the most important is the principle known in the business as
"calling party pays."

In Europe, the person who calls someone using a mobile phone pays
entirely for that call. The called person pays nothing. This "calling
party pays" principle also applies to fixed lines everywhere, Europe
or the U.S., for calls made on the networks of BT, France Telecom, or
Bell South. But on mobile phones in the U.S., the called party, the
person who owns the mobile phone, pays part of the charges, so
Americans use mobile phones less and turn them off to avoid paying for
unwanted incoming calls.

This difference in pricing is thought to be an important element in
European domination in the mobile-phone wars. A greater proportion of
Europeans have mobile phones than do Americans. The European mobile
standard -- GSM -- dominates the world market, as do European phone
and network-equipment manufacturers.

None of this seems to matter to British regulators, however, which are
currently considering sweeping changes -- not only to how the
mobile-phone business is regulated but how customers themselves pay
for the calls they make and receive.

Subject: MS Seeks Malware, Bust Phones After SPV Security Crack


By John Lettice

A quite bizarre CNET report reveals that Microsoft's Security 
Response Center began investigations into the circumvention of 
security on the SPV smartphone on Tuesday, searching -- so says CNET, 
anyway -- for reports of rogue programs on the network and damaged 
phones.

Furthermore, says an anonymous source "familiar with the situation,"
unlocking an SPV "is a difficult process that sometimes involves
taking the phone apart." Oh really? One hazards a guess that this
particular source is familiar with the situation as they would like it
to be, and as it no doubt will be by version 2.0 or 3.0 - security
hard-wired into the silicon, and the client irretrievably
controlled/owned by somebody out there, not you.

CPSC, American Power Conversion Corp. Announce Recall of Back-Up Power 
Supply Systems

WASHINGTON, D.C. - In cooperation with the U.S. Consumer Product
Safety Commission (CPSC), American Power Conversion Corporation (APC),
of West Kingston, R.I., is voluntarily recalling about 900,000 back-up
power supply devices.  These devices are primarily used to protect
computers in case of a power failure.  The power supply device can
fail, causing the unit to overheat, which may pose a fire hazard to
consumers.
	
APC has received six reports of units overheating resulting in the
melting of the unit's outer casing and three reports of minor property
damage.  No injuries have been reported.
	
The recalled Back-UPS(r) CS Uninterruptible Power Supply devices
include the Back-UPS CS350 and the Back-UPS CS 500 models.  The model
number can be found on the front of the unit, along with the words,
"Back-UPS CS" and "APC." In addition, one of the following numbers
shows up on the bar code label located on the bottom of the unit:
BK350, BK500, BK500BLK. The recalled power supply devices also have
one of the following serial numbers - AB0048 through AB0251, BB0104
through BB0251, and JB0125 through JB0251 - which can be found on the
bottom of the unit.  Units with an "R" at the end of the serial number
within the above ranges are not part of this recall.
	
Retailers, computer and electrical distributors, and catalogs
nationwide sold the power supply devices from November 2000 through
December 2002 for between $70 and $130.
	
Consumers should immediately stop using the power supply devices by
turning off the power to all connected equipment, turning the Back-
UPS CS off, and then unplugging it from the electrical outlet.  To
obtain a free replacement unit, consumers should contact the company
at (888) APC-RELY (272-7359) between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET Monday
through Friday or log on to the company's website at www.apc.com/rely.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Tire maker Michelin MICP.PA said on Tuesday it
planned to embed technology in its tires that would allow them to be
wirelessly linked to the car they are mounted on and transmit details
like inflation pressure to a dashboard computer.

Michelin North America, a unit of the French maker of tires and travel

Proponents of such RFID tags, which store, send and receive data

consumer products are designed once their price falls far enough.

Staff Writer, CNET News.com

DirecTV's high-speed Internet customers are getting an extra two weeks
to find a new Net connection, but the company says their time is
running out.

The broadband ISP (Internet service provider) originally planned to
turn off service Thursday to any of its 160,000 DSL (digital
subscriber line) customers who hadn't found an alternative
connection. Only a third of those subscribers actually have canceled
service in the month since the company announced it was leaving the
broadband business, however.

In e-mails and postal mail sent to the remaining customers this week, 
the company said it is providing an extra two weeks, but that Jan. 31 
will be the drop-dead date.

Subject: After the Copyright Smackdown: What Next?


Don't despair at the Supreme Court's gift to Disney, says one expert. 
The fight has really only just begun.

By Siva Vaidhyanathan

Jan. 17, 2003 | When the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that
Congress was within its constitutional bounds to extend the duration
of all copyrights by 20 years -- up to 70 years beyond the life of the
author and potentially infinitely -- many saw the ruling as a knockout
blow to the movement to reform copyright.

Some on the public interest side are tempted to lament what could be
called the "Dred Scott case for culture," unjustifiably locking up
content that deserves to be free. After all, six of the nine justices
concurred with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg when she issued a stark
opinion that cavalierly dismissed the historical "bargain" that
justified American copyright in the first place: We the People agree
to grant a limited, temporary monopoly to a creator or publisher in
exchange for access to creativity and the eventual return of the work
to a state of freedom.

And Ginsburg's opinion did not allow that the purpose of copyright is
to encourage future production, not lock up works already created.
She ignored the fact that the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act
of 1998 does nothing to "promote the progress" of science or art
because it grants no incentive to produce and distribute new works.

So out of despair some might see civil disobedience -- hacking and
freely distributing songs and films over digital networks -- as the
only remaining response to the excesses of the copyright regimes and
the hold they have over courts and Congress.

While disobedience might be more fun, the power of civil discourse
remains. In fact, the ruling gives public interest activists both
motivation and ammunition in the continuing battle against the
excessive expansion of the power to control information and culture.

BTW, re 'Gitmo' and Cuba ...

Cuba has a recently updated version of their Numbering Plan document at
the ITU's website:

http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/index.html
http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/inr/nnp/index.html

(I'd mentioned this site recently, regarding Afghanistan's numbering
plan document, in my recent post on Tokelau ... you can also find
Tokelau's numbering plan and NUMEROUS other countries' numbering plans
including documentation on the recently expanded numbering plans for
+501 Belize and +592 Guyana at this site as well!)

I don't have Cuba's plan in front of me at the moment, but I seem to
think that they do *NOT* use the leading digit of '9' for any domestic
Cuban area codes. Neither do they start off national numbering with
'0'. I would "expect" a leading '0' for (domestic) toll calls, and a
leading '00' for international dialed calls, but I don't know for
certain if they follow the usual "most-of-the-rest-of-the-world"
standard or not.

But what's to stop Cuba from ever using +53-9(etc) for *CUBAN*
national numbering?! After all, isn't +53 an ITU code assigned to
*CUBA* and not the US? The use of +53-99 to reach 'Gitmo' from the US,
and ONLY dialable from the US -- outside of the US government and
telcos, who in the international telecom community (ITU/etc)
authorized this? It seems that no-one outside of the US 'honors'
+53-99 to reach 'Gitmo'; if Cuba determines that they want to start
using +53-9(etc) for *their* own internal numbering, then what happens
to 'Gitmo'? I would expect the "rest of the world" to honor such
possible +53-9(etc) as part of *CUBA's* own internal numbering!

> I wonder if there are secret Virginia numbers for Gitmo, like the

And I do agree that the current rate for the US to even *DIAL* 'Gitmo'
is *OUTRAGEOUS*. But even THAT (expensive rates) aside, if *routing*
to 'Gitmo' is *NOT* 'via Cuba', WHY does 'Gitmo' even use a segment of
*CUBA'S* numbering plan!?

I would think that since 'Gitmo' is SO CLOSE to the US mainland (and
in the *CARIBBEAN* at that too), that the Base *really* should be
numbered and dialed as a *NANP* location, maybe with a set of NXX
c.o. codes under the 787 (or 939 overlay) area codes for Puerto Rico!

But maybe there's something else here, regarding rates... if a
*REGULAR* NANP (and *US*, since Puerto Rico is billed as a domestic
call with the mainland US) area code is used, maybe the contract
company for routing calls between the mainland and 'Gitmo' wouldn't be
able to charge the outrageous "GRAVY-LADEN" rates they presently
do!???

As for possible 'secret' Virginia-based "NANP" numbers for 'Gitmo',
I wonder how many *OTHER* US Military Bases overseas as well as US
embassies and such, or even private corporations with "virtual corporate
networks" might actually be dialable at domestic rates, if one knew the
(secret) POTS/NANP number, since the calling party *would* in effect be
dialing a US/NANP type number (NPA-NXX)!?

The US Military, State Department, and *other* US government offices
located overseas still have "Autovon/DSN" or FTS-type numbers, don't
they?  I know that the *numbering plan* for Autovon/DSN is still a
'private network' type of numbering plan, but I think that FTS
abandoned their private/corporate numbering in favor of using REAL
POTS NANP numbering, a few years back. And even though Autovon/DSN is
still *itself* not part of the "public" NANP POTS numbering plan, most
locations on the Autovon/ DSN network also have 'parallel' NANP/POTS
numbers as well. So, if one knew the POTS/NANP number, one could be
able to dial at domestic rates.  I wonder if one could still call to a
PBX/switchboard/attendant type operator at some mainland location and
be 'transfered' to the US government facility overseas as well.

Steve Alexander
Star Tribune

In a Catch-22 price increase plan, Internet-only customers of AT&T
Broadband in St. Paul will be charged an additional $11 a month unless
they agree to subscribe to at least the basic tier of cableTV service
 -- for $11 a month.

Today, an AT&T Broadband customer with a cable modem pays $47 a month
for high-speed Internet-only service; those leasing a modem pay $50 a
month. Beginning next month, those prices will increase about 22
percent to $58 and $61 a month, respectively, for Internet-only
customers.

http://www.startribune.com/stories/1557/3594614.html

http://www.skypoint.com/~hudsonl

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: So $58 minus $47 or $61 minus $50 is
still an $11 difference, or what they charge for the 'basic tier'. I
would say if they want to watch television, then add the basic tier, 
essentially for free at the new price, however I cannot see what the
advantage would be if they are not into television. For that matter
I really have problems with cable modem service also. I cannot see
where/how it is any faster than DSL, and in fact I've heard rumors
that cable modem users with 'network neighborhood' enabled on their
computers get a lot of spies reading their files, etc.  True?  PAT]

I have limited sympathy for the subscribers.  ATTBI is certainly doing
a bad thing, but there's an old saying that applies here: "Fool me
once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."

There are many ways to get a relatively permanent email address.  Here
are a few:

1) You might belong to an organization which provides email forwarding
addresses to its members.  The email address I use to post to Usenet
is provided by the Association for Computing Machinery; mail sent to
jfh@acm.org is automatically rerouted to a real mailbox elsewhere.  If
that real mailbox goes away because the provider is bought up, no one
but me has to know - I just change the forwarding address, and
jfh@acm.org continues to work.

(I've been using this address on Usenet since 1995, and sometimes I'm
amazed by how much spam I receive.  But I still don't use a mangled
address.  I use Spamnix instead.)

2) You might have attended a college or university which provides
either forwarding or real mailboxes to alumni.  Sometimes you have to
be member of the alumni association, but sometimes you don't.

3) You can register a domain name and set up a forwarding account.
One outfit that will do this is <www.mydomain.com>; they charge
$15/year for the domain name registration, and the forwarding is free.

4) You can get an email address at yahoo or hotmail.  These work fine,
but you may be taken less seriously with that kind of address.  If you
want a lot of mail storage or other goodies, you might have to pay,
but the price is small compared to the price of a broadband
connection.

5) Last (and least), you can get a userid at AOL, which is unlikely to
change its name.

How strong is this "oscillator signal"?  Strong enough to be detected
outside the car?  To be detected from the side of the ride?  To be

Actually, it is possible to detect the local oscillator of the receiver.  
Depending upon how well the radio is sheilded, and on how much of the L.O. 
signal leaks back through to the antenna, the oscillator can often be 
detected a good few yards away.

An I.F. of 455kHz for normal AM broadcast has been pretty much
standard or many decades now, at least in the U.S.A.  In most radios,
the L.O. runs above the tuned frequency, so it's a simple matter of
sampling the L.O.  leakage and deducting 455kHz to get the frequency
being listened to.  For FM broadcasting, the I.F. is almost always
10.7MHz these days.

By Justin Pope, Associated Press, 1/15/2003 15:45

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) So, you think you've cleaned all your personal
files from that old computer hard drive you're selling?

A pair of MIT graduate students suggest you think again.

Over two years, Simson Garfinkel and Abhi Shelat assembled a
collection of 158 used hard drives, shelling out between $5 and $30
for each at secondhand computer stores and on eBay.

Of the 129 drives that functioned, 69 still had recoverable files on
them and 49 contained ''significant personal information'' medical
correspondence, love letters, pornography and 5,000 credit card
numbers. One even had a year's worth of transactions with account
numbers from an ATM in Illinois.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I do not understand why, when people 
prepare to sell or otherwise dump an old computer, they do not use
a 'laundry machine' program first, to clean the entire hard drive,
then use added 'bleach' to rewrite garbage on the hard drive at least
five or six times as per NSA recommendations, *then* format the entire
drive.  PAT]

Despite the police evidently believing this (and reconfirming the
dollar figure to the reporter), it's not so.  High dollar amounts,
maybe, but nothing like *that* high -- as Ms. Robb might confirm by
asking the police to cite an actual example of someone, anywhere,
who had been billed for a call at such a per-minute rate.

Linc Madison explained it right here in comp.dcom.telecom in 2001<*>,
while Pat was off duty: the original version of the story must have
said $25 -- already an unlikely large amount -- which was turned
into "=2425" by transmission in MIME quoted-printable encoding,
but read by someone in an environment where that encoding wasn't
recognized, and so *seen* as "=2425" and "helpfully corrected" by
the human to "$2,425".

So, as Linc said at the time, "If you ever see a spam claiming

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Several unscrupulous "spammers" have been shut
down after bombarding Internet users with e-mail offers for allegedly
bogus international drivers' licenses, the U.S. Federal Trade
Commission said Thursday.

The move should put the brakes on a common scam that has evolved into 
one of the most prevalent forms of unwanted junk e-mail over the past 
several years. 

The FTC charged six online marketers with selling international 
drivers' licenses that actually are not recognized by any government, 
targeting immigrants and those who have had their real licenses 
revoked.

Well, I get something more like 20-30kb/s from my GPRS connection here
in the UK. However GPRS connection speed does depend on quality of
connection -- GPRS drops to a higher overhead coding scheme in low
signal/high interference, so YMMV.

Luckily I don't pay for my mobile phone bill, so I don't get crippled
with high data bills, but I certanly appreciate the poster's anguish
at high data cost. I don't think many mobile operatrs are really
setting tarriffs up for web surfing -- and most web pages aren't
really designed to optimise mobile data bills either ;+) The problem
is that GPRS data is a very new service, and 'Bellhead' marketing
people in mobile nets have yet to really get their head round high
levels of dsata usage. To be fair, you do have to have a very well
dimensioned and optimised access network to be able to support high
levels of web surfing at reasonable data throughput (trust me, I do
this for a living), so high pricing is arguably there to try to
control early adopter demand.

As someone with Privacy Manager, I have to say that I have found it by
and large quite effective. I get calls with all zeros and with 800
numbers showing in the display. These calls are ignored or sent
straight to voice mail (where no message is ever left). Other than

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  Well I have found it reasonably 
effective also. I have since moved one of my caller-ID boxes into
the computer room area where I spend much time so I can glance over
at it and see what numbers/names, if any, are presented when the

out the calls where the ID was deliberatly withheld, i.e. *67 type
calls. Its the 'default' style calls, where the caller does nothing
deliberate (except possibly working for a telemarketer) that SWB
handles poorly. My *big* complaint with them was actually with their
former parent, AT&T, who was/is still using all zeros and things like
'name withheld' as ID in order to circumvent the 'system'. SWB does
claim all zeros (or all of anything, ones or nines, etc) is considered
a valid number for ID purposes, and they refuse  to manually edit

Yes it is.  If you have an ISDN line (or SS7) there are indicators for
this.  In a well engineered network, which are harder and harder to
find these days mind you, the display on your phone should show you
when forwarding takes place by indicating the new number and the
reason for forwarding.  There is also an indication for the connected
number should that differ from the dialed number once answer has taken
place.

If you have ISDN (or SS7) you will ahve an indication of whether the
call is international or not as well as what numbering plan is in use.
This makes it very definitive indeed.  There is no reason why
international CLID shouldn't work properly.  It is true that it
probably doesn't work properly in most cases is a matter of improper
network engineering and CPE device design.  The first time I received
an international CLID here in Bell Canada land my Vista 350 telephone
(by Nortel) truncated the number and formated it as 417-xxx-xxxx.

I just spent 45 minutes on the phone with Bell Mobility to finally get
a definitive answer as to why my voicemail envelope information (pressing
5 while listening to a message) never gives me the number of the caller.
Instead it says "New message from an outside caller". 
 
At first they insisted that it did work, and that only in cases where
the caller blocked the number would it not.  Then we tested it together.
It worked the same on my cell number as it did on theirs.

Then the story became that two years ago it did work but that they
stopped offering call return.  At that point the envelope information
stopped appearing.

This is of course very lame.  I have a reasonable expectation that my
voicemail on my cell number will operate the same as the voicemail on
my land line.  Especially given that they are both provided by Bell
Canada (Bell Mobility is wholely integrated with Bell Canada, they
have the same web site).

This is yet another example of how the cellular companies offer an
inferior service to that of the local exchange operators.  A shining
example of this is Caller's Name Display which is unavailable from any
cellular operator yet so common on landlines that my elderly mother
has it.

This may be a stretch regarding topic, but since I plan to view a SMTP
log in real time to spot spam it kind of relates to current
discussions regarding spam.  I just wanted to ask people who know what
they are talking about.

What I am trying to find is a utility like the linux "tail" which
allows you to watch a log/text file as it changes in real time (sort
of).  But I need a version of that for Win2K Server.

While I'm at it, let me also share with you a little trick.  If you
have a linux box you can telnet in from remote run tail (with some
command switches that I forget) on the log and then set your telnet to
save the log to disk.  Then even if your linux box were to get hacked
and the logs deleted on the way out, you would have a log of whodunnit
on your remote machine.   I used to log my linux log to my OS/2
machine.

Now I just want to have my smtp log on my desktop in real time.

Subject: Student Rush
From: Frank Beider <fhb@norlight.com>

I used to work for a LEC in a college town.  Every August thought
September we used to experience something called the "student rush".
There was this rush of orders during this August - September for
telephone service from students.  We put in a lot of overtime to meet
this rush.

Here is my question.  Do the LECs in a college town still experience the
student rush during August - September?

The reason I ask is now with the proliferation of wireless phones
thanks to generous parents is there still a student rush?  I would
think students are using wireless in place of the landline.  Bad of
the LEC good for wireless.

What have the LECs been experiencing?

Would appreciate any info.

Thanks.

Dave:

I am an sales engineer for one of the top five Inter-tel dealers in
the country. We currently have five offices networked via IP over
leased lines. We are one of the major beta test sites for Inter-tel. 
I don't know the Harris system at all. But take into consideration
market share and profitability and no one else can match Inter-tel. 

Let me tell you when I design call center applications I add features
that will push my comp. to go to their Definity Call Center
Application and I am 30% less than what they are while providing 90%
of their functionality.

Go for the Inter-tel. If it isn't a direct office....shop for the
best.

[1] EPIC Wins FOIA Lawsuit Against Pentagon on Poindexter Records
=======================================================================

U.S. District Judge John Bates today issued a decision that rejects the
Defense Department's attempt to impose financial obstacles to EPIC's
requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The court ruled
that EPIC is entitled to "preferred fee status" under the FOIA and
ordered the Pentagon to "expeditiously" process EPIC's almost year-old
request for information concerning Admiral John Poindexter and the
Information Awareness Office (see item below concerning the
controversial Total Information Awareness program).

Under 1986 legislative amendments to FOIA enacted in an effort to "keep
fees from becoming an unnecessary barrier to disclosure," entities
granted "news media status" are not required to pay search and
duplication fees related to their FOIA requests. EPIC has routinely
been granted such status since its inception. In response to an EPIC
FOIA request submitted in February 2002 seeking documents from
Poindexter's office, DoD refused to process the request unless EPIC
agreed to incur substantial fees. The agency claimed that EPIC, as a
non-profit public interest organization, did not fall within DoD's
definition of "representative of the news media."

In granting EPIC news media status, Judge Bates noted EPIC's
publication activities and stated:

     EPIC gleans the information it publishes in its books from a
     wide variety of sources, including FOIA requests, state and
     federal courts, government agencies, universities,
     international groups, law reviews, interest groups, and even
     other news sources. EPIC researches issues on privacy and
     civil liberties, reports on this information, analyzes
     relevant data, evaluates the newsworthiness of material and
     puts the facts and issues into context, publishing and
     distributing this "news" through the sale of its books to the
     public. All these activities are hallmarks of publishing,
     news, and journalism.

The decision removes potential obstacles for requests submitted not
only by EPIC, but also by other public interest groups that seek to
inform the public about significant (and secretive) government
activities. The immediate impact will be to expedite the release of
documents concerning data-mining initiatives within the Pentagon.

=======================================================================
[2] Sen. Feingold Introduces "Total Info" Moratorium Bill
=======================================================================

Sen. Russell Feingold (D-WI) has introduced legislation to place a
moratorium on the development of the controversial Total Information
Awareness (TIA) project.  TIA is a system being developed by Admiral
John Poindexter of the Defense Advance Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
that aims to sift though troves of personal information in order to
detect potential terrorist activity.  Feingold's legislation would stop
development of this domestic surveillance system until Congress has had
an opportunity to review its implications.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) has also introduced legislation to halt the TIA
project.  His legislation would be attached to the pending Defense
Department appropriations bill, but it currently contains a provision
that could allow President Bush to override the moratorium.

Feingold's legislation follows a groundswell of Congressional criticism
of TIA.  The growing list of Senators raising questions about TIA
includes Susan Collins (R-ME), Charles Grassley (R-IA), Tom Harkin
(D-IA), Charles Schumer (D-NY), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Patrick
Leahy (D-VT).  Sen. Collins, the incoming Chairwoman of the
Governmental Affairs Committee, recently said that the Pentagon project
"raises extraordinary concerns about individual privacy."  Sen.
Grassley has called for the Inspector General of the Department of
Defense to review the TIA project.  Sen. Harkin has requested that
Poindexter be summoned before Defense Appropriations Subcommittee to
testify on TIA.  Sen. Schumer has called upon Defense Secretary Donald
Rumsfeld to replace Poindexter, saying, "If we need a big brother, John
Poindexter is the last guy on the list that I would choose."  Senators
Leahy, Cantwell and Feingold have sent a detailed letter to Attorney
General Ashcroft requesting more information about the use of
data-mining, and the extent to which the Department of Justice is
collaborating with DARPA on TIA.

EPIC and a coalition of groups that includes the American Civil
Liberties Union, American Conservative Union, Eagle Forum, and the
Electronic Frontier Foundation have joined the call for a moratorium on
TIA.  In a letter to the leaders of several key congressional
committees, the coalition argued that Congress should prohibit the
development of TIA and other data mining initiatives.

[3] INS Seeks Information on U.S. Citizens Who Travel
=======================================================================

The Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has proposed a new
rule that would require all individuals leaving or entering the United
States -- including U.S. citizens -- to provide certain personal
information to the government in advance of an aircraft or vessel's
arrival in or departure from the United States.  The required data
would include complete name; date of birth; citizenship; sex; passport
number and country of issuance; country of residence; United States
visa number, date, and place of visa issuance, where applicable; alien
registration number, where applicable; and United States address while
in the United States.  Such identification requirements currently apply
only to non-resident aliens.

The new rule proposes to implement section 402, titled Passenger
Manifests, of the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of
2002 (Pub. L. 107-173), which requires that commercial carriers
transporting passengers to or from the United States deliver arrival
and departure manifest information electronically to the INS, beginning
no later than January 1, 2003.

The new rule proposes to require manifest data on certain passengers
and voyages previously exempt from this requirement, including U.S.
citizens, lawful permanent resident aliens of the United States,
immigrants to the United States, and certain in-transit passengers.
The INS believes that the new rule is necessary to provide it with
advance notification of information necessary for the identification of
passengers, crewmembers and any other occupant transported.
Furthermore, INS believes that this information will assist in the
efficient inspection of passengers and crewmembers, and is necessary
for the effective enforcement of the immigration laws.

Public comments on the proposed rule may be submitted until February 3
in one of the following ways:

* Written comments should be submitted (with reference INS No. 2182-01)
to:

     Director, Regulations and Forms Services Division
     Immigration and Naturalization Service
     425 I Street NW., Room 4034
     Washington, DC 20536

* Electronic comments should be submitted to the INS at
insregs@usdoj.gov with INS No. 2182-01 in the subject heading.

The proposed INS rule is available at:

Reform Act of 2002 is available at:

[4] Court Grants EPIC Right to Discovery in Homeland Security Case
=======================================================================

U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly issued a decision on
December 26 permitting EPIC to pursue discovery concerning the "nature
of the authority" delegated to the Office of Homeland Security (OHS)
and its Director, Tom Ridge.  The ruling came in a Freedom of
Information Act lawsuit filed by EPIC after OHS took the position that
it is not subject to the open government law.

The Department of Justice sought dismissal of EPIC's FOIA lawsuit and
argued that OHS is not an "agency" and therefore is not subject to the
FOIA's disclosure requirements.  The government asserted that the OHS
"functions solely to advise and assist the President and, does not
exercise substantial independent authority."  It likened the OHS to the
National Security Council, which the D.C. Circuit Court in 1996 held
was exempt from the FOIA.

EPIC, which will now seek information concerning the structure and
activities of OHS, firmly believes that, under well-established
principles of open government, an entity like the OHS -- especially
with its important mandate -- should be open to public oversight.  The
FOIA, which, among other agencies, covers the CIA, FBI, and NSA, makes
adequate provision for protecting sensitive information from
disclosure.  The creation of the new Department of Homeland Security
makes the status of OHS even more significant, as the Office will
continue to function within the White House and is likely to set policy
for the Department.

EPIC's initial request sought the disclosure of documents relating to
OHS Director Tom Ridge's efforts to create a "trusted-traveler" card
and his plans to standardize state driver's licenses so as to create a
de facto national identification system.

=======================================================================
[5] Georgia Supreme Court Voids Fornication Law on Privacy Grounds
=======================================================================

The Supreme Court of Georgia has invalidated a state anti-fornication
law, holding that "the government may not reach into the bedroom of a
private residence and criminalize the private, noncommercial,
consensual sexual acts of two persons legally capable of consenting to
those acts."  The 170-year-old Georgia law provides that sex between
unmarried people constitutes a misdemeanor and could be fined at least
$1000.  The Court recognized that the "right to privacy has a value so
essential to individual liberty in our society that its infringement
merits careful scrutiny by the courts."

The Court also rejected the prosecution's argument that an individual
has no right to privacy when they are a guest in another's home: " We
reject the broad assertion that people abandon their constitutional
guarantee to privacy when they enter as guests into the private home of
another. An invitation to enter another person's private home does not
include an implicit condition that the guest surrender his
constitutional right to privacy."

The decision extends a 1998 ruling where the same court invalidated a
state anti-sodomy law that was previously upheld by the U.S. Supreme
Court.  The U.S. Supreme Court will revisit the issue of anti-sodomy
laws this term in Lawrence and Garner v. Texas.  That case will test
sodomy laws in 13 states.

[6] Privacy International Urges UK Citizens to Oppose National ID Card
=======================================================================

Looking for a way to voice your opposition to the United Kingdom
government's "Entitlement Card" National ID proposal?  Here's your
chance.  Privacy International and STAND, a UK group working to inform
the public about privacy, censorship, and other issues, have set up a
campaign allowing members of the UK public to leave phone or fax
messages for their Member of Parliament (MP) to let them know just what
the public thinks of their National ID proposal.  The UK government,
which is currently holding a "silent consultation" on the National ID
card -- and still claiming that there is majority support for ID cards
-- has confirmed that these phone/fax messages will be regarded as
legitimate responses in the consultation.

To voice your opposition to UK National ID, call 0845 330 7246 in the
UK, or see below for a link to STAND's online fax service.

Depends on the cable system.  My understanding is that the most common
DSL tops out below 1.5Mb/sec and drops off quickly as you move away
from the CO.  Meanwhile, Time Warner cable modem service in Houston
gives 1.5Mb/sec everywhere, and I often see my residential service
peak at 2Mb/sec.

On the other hand, I've seen plenty of cable modems and DSL services
that are much slower, such as 384kb/sec.  At least with the cable
modem, you don't have to worry about the distance, and there is enough
spare bandwidth that you don't have to worry about whether your
neighbors are also surfing.

Re: network neighborhood, I don't think there is any difference for
DSL vs Cable.  In both cases, you esentually become part of a larger
network, usually the "internet", and if you expose those services
without a firewall, people will see them.

If anyone in telecomland wants such an email forwarder free of charge,
drop me a line.  I've got the following domain names available - you
can have any (not already in use) username in any of these domains,
forwarded to whatever mailbox you specify:

telussucks.info
interocitor.net
oldtimeradiovault.com
garynuman.info
lindstrom.ca

With Dave Leibold's permission, I could possibly add wtng.info to that
list as well.

(If you want to use my services but with your own domain name, that too
is doable but at a small price, which I won't name as I ain't gonna
spam this mailing list, heh heh!  Drop me a line if that's what you
need.)

Because joe average computer user doesn't realize that by deleting a
file and emptying the recycle bin/trash they have only removed the
directory entry leaving the data still there.

While Pat's method would definitely clean the drive beyond readable,
unless you expect the government spooks to be searching the hard
drive, a single format is enough.  There are several Super-erase
programs available that overwrite the data in addition to removing
(and overwriteing) the directory entry for the cautious among us.

It seems like it would have been a simple matter for the Coquitlam Now
reporter to check her phone book to see if the area codes actually
matched the countries.  That discrepancy alone should have been enough
to make her suspicious about the accuracy of this so-called "latest
telephone scam."

Anyway, I can't wait to see Linc Madison's response to this.  He must be
getting awfully tired of debunking the same old hoax!

Hey Pat,

I love reading the Digest, and I think it's wonderful, but is it at
all possible to create something like comp.dcom.telecom.montysolomon?
Not that I don't enjoy the news, but there's so much of it that it
really feels like it's cluttering up the NG and stifling most other
conversation.

Thanks for listening to my kvetching!

Nice concept. But without any citations (and I didn't find anything in a
web search - which, of course, doesn't prove it didn't happen) this sounds
way too much like a Chief Seattle type urban legend.

I'll readily concede my knowledge of historical China only goes back as 
far as the Boxer Rebellion. But I'd really like to see if there's any 
valid historical proof that this type of checks and balances existed.

I'd at least have gone through with my testimony - then explained to
the judge exactly what went on in that room.  Yes, the "niggers" would
have got off scot free (which they did anyways when you walked away),
but at least you'd have publicly embarrassed the prosecutor and cop,
and maybe, just maybe, gotten them in a bit of trouble.

What you and Gordon have described is gross misconduct and certainly
"criminal" behaviour, for which these people should spend time in
prison (preferably sharing the same cell as those they've convicted).
But Gordon advocated killing these people.  It seems grossly
disproportionate, thus I questioned just what he'd been drinking - I
still do.  At worst, if you could prove (beyond a reasonable doubt)
that a prosecutor knowingly put someone on death row when he knew (or
should have known) that that person was not guilty of a capital crime,
the prosecutor should be found guilty of attempted murder.  And
attempted murder, though a heinous crime in and of itself, does NOT
merit the death penalty.

Pat, some time ago you got on my case because I stated that that kid
out in California deserved the chair.  How can you advocate leniency
and understanding in that case, yet defend Gordon's proposal that
prosecutors guilty of misconduct should be put to death?  Don't you see
the contradiction here?  Don't you see that Gordon and yourself are
both guilty of the "reactionary", "let's lynch 'em!" attitude you
accused ME of?

Several folks, myself included, have accused John Higdon of living in
his own little world and not seeing the bigger picture.  I think maybe
the same could be said of you, Pat.  Yes, from all accounts, Chicago's
justice system is rife with corruption (though I have trouble believing
that every single police officer, prosecutor, and judge is corrupt). 
But Chicago is a worst-case scenario.  Don't get me wrong - it needs
fixing.  Badly.  But it does NOT reflect the rest of the USA and the
rest of the world.  You seem only able to look at criminal justice
cases in other places through the lens of your Chicago experience, and
I think that's a shame.

There are a lot of honest, hard-working police officers and prosecutors
out there.  It's too bad they all get tarred with the same brush.  They
are ALL that stands between us and complete chaos.

And how is she expected to do that, Gordon?  I would really like your
thoughts on that - I've had a lousy day and REALLY could do with a
good laugh right now.

There is no way to ENSURE that evidence is not cooked in any case -
period.  Not even if she dispenses with the police and conducts the
entire investigation herself - interviewing witnesses, conducting DNA
testing, the whole nine yards.  At some point, you have to rely on
your witnesses in the witness box, and while you may believe with all
of your heart that they are telling God's own truth, they COULD BE
LYING.

And you would have us execute Jane because somebody else lied?  You
would punish her for the behaviour of somebody else?

What if she did everything she could think of, but either didn't think
to ask someone a particular question or simply forgot to?  Tough -
kill her.  We sentence you to death for doing your job incompetently
(or less than brilliantly, as the case may be).

Whoa there, pardner.  Back up a second.  You actually think it's ok to
have a system in place whereby the state will execute Jane BECAUSE SHE
WAS DECEIVED INTO A FALSE PROSECUTION?  I got news for you: it doesn't
work that way.  We don't use strict liability for serious cases like
this, and Lord help us if we ever do.  You HAVE to prove that Jane
actively conspired with the detectives and/or others to falsely
convict someone of a capital crime - she had to KNOWINGLY do this.  In
the example above, you not only haven't proved this, you also say it's
ok for Jane to get fried EVEN THOUGH SHE LEGITIMATELY BELIEVED HER
CASE WAS CLEAN.  We then tell her family: "yeah, those cops probably
set her up - too bad we had to croak her.  You might wanna go after
those cops, prove they set her up, and get them fried too."

I ask you again, Gordon.  What exactly have you been drinking?  I'm
guessing some really cheap tequila.

Right.  And there's a reason it's not done anymore.  Similar to the
reasons why we don't live in caves anymore, and why we don't bonk
women we want to have sex with over the head and drag them back to our
cave by their hair (though some guys in bars are only BARELY better
behaved, I'll admit).  We are trying to civilize ourselves, and aren't
interested in going back 1000 years in time.

It's ironic.  Normally it's we conservatives being accused of wanting
to live in the past and go back to the old days.  At least we only
want to go back to the 1950's, not the 1000's.  :-) Ironic also, that
you (and Pat) would advocate a system whereby it's really easy to
(literally) condemn a prosecutor for not doing their job well enough
(or in bad faith), yet condemn our current system for making it too
easy to condemn people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time
("c'mon, take the deal, or you'll get a much longer sentence!")
Typical liberalism - think with the heart, not with the head.

It is her job, as prosecutor, to ENSURE that the evidence is NOT cooked.
Her life is literally on the line -- as is the life of the accused.  If
she is not willing to risk her own life on the evidence, she has no
right to risk John's life either.

So let's say she legitimately believes the evidence is clean. 
Obviously, the detectives would know it's not, and yet they allow her to
proceed with a Capital case.  Jane's kin (and/or the Prosecutor's
office) would probably send up the detectives for murdering Jane.  They
might all fry together.  Knowing this potential outcome would (or
should) deter the detectives from faking evidence in the first place.

As I said, this has no chance of actually being implemented in today's
world.  But apparently the Chinese beat me to it by a millennium or so.

Yup.  But you're missing a key point:  Nobody's _requiring_ Jane to go
for the kill in any case.  The particular case I made up wasn't really
worthy of Capital Punishment in the first place: No direct witnesses,
and what evidence they had was mostly circumstantial.  Jane was an idiot
for making the call she made.  But then, I invented Jane, and I invented
her as exactly the kind of idiot I needed for demonstration purposes.

> And you would have us execute Jane because somebody else lied?  You

Nope.  I would punish her for her own behaviour:  Pursuing Capital
Punishment in a case where it wasn't warranted.

You're beginning to catch on!  Prosecutors who ask for Capital
Punishment must perform their jobs -- all facets -- with mathematical
perfection.  Someone's life is in the balance, we can ask for no less.
Like a nuclear weapon, Capital Punishment is intended to work as a
deterrent: When it must actually be _used_, that means it has failed.
But to fail to use it when it's prescribed makes it useless.

> Whoa there, pardner.  Back up a second.  You actually think it's ok to

> WAS DECEIVED INTO A FALSE PROSECUTION?

Yup.  It's her job not to be deceivable.  She didn't HAVE to call for
Capital Punishment.  She could decide the evidence isn't strong enough
to risk a life on, and opt for some other punishment.

Under current law, yes.  But keep in mind, I'm suggesting a change to
current law.

> In the example above, you not only haven't

As I said, you're beginning to catch on.  I didn't say it was "OK" for
her to fry, but that she must.  A thin but critical semantic difference.

> We then tell her family:
> "yeah, those cops probably set her up - too bad we had to croak her.

I'm pretty sure the family would reach this conclusion without outside
assistance.

But nobody has to prove the detectives "set her up".  They only need to
prove that the detectives faked evidence (which was already proven as
part of John's exoneration) and that their actions led to Jane's death.

I believe that someone who calls for the execution of another person
should be willing to put their own life on the line.

> yet condemn our current system for making it too
> easy to condemn people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time

I try to stay out of "wrong places" -- been in a couple, and left as
soon as I figured it out.  Almost certainly avoided some (undeserved)
jail time in one case, as Bad Things happened shortly after I left.

> Typical liberalism - think with the heart, not with the head.

I'm fairly liberal in some respects, and fairly conservative in others. 
But I take umbrage at being called "typical".

Yes I know this - but what I did was postulate another hypothetical
case.  Under your plan, "Jane" comes across a case that appears
air-tight.  She's got a Dahmer-like guy that needs to be put out of her
misery.  She dots all her i's and crosses all her t's, does everything
exactly the way she was supposed to do it, and gets the conviction. 
Afterwards, she sleeps well at night, knowing she got a monster off the
streets.

Then, a few months later, one of the police detectives cracks.  Seems
he and his cohorts set this guy up - he was never guilty of these
crimes.  Someone ELSE out there did it, and he's still loose.

In that situation, you advocate Jane's death.  Sorry, but you just
ain't gonna convince me that this is A Good Idea<tm>.

And if all the evidence at the time suggested it WAS warranted, as
above?

No, when it must actually be used, it means SOCIETY has failed to some
degree, in that it failed to educate the perp as to what behaviours
are, and are not, acceptable.  Then again, some people just have a
genetic predisposition to be naughty.  But I've never really been one
to buy into this idea that deterrence is the main idea behind capital
punishment.  I firmly believe that some people SO offend the rest of
us that they have to be put down, like mad dogs.  When we kill a mad
dog, we don't do it with the hope that the other neighbourhood dogs
will see it and think to themselves, "whoa!, I guess I better not do
THAT or they're gonna shoot me!"

Nobody is impervious to being deceived.  Ergo, you are advocating the
abolition of prosecution.

Which would change not only current law, but one of the fundamental
principles underlying ALL current law.  No, it ain't gonna fly - not in
this society.  Ancient China, perhaps.  The world under Saddam and Bin
Laden, perhaps ...

And while she's at it, they can go after *YOU*, for supporting this

Perhaps at the very first, when cable modems came out as - and DSL
devices were being adapted to - simple Ethernet bridges.  However,
security seems to have been improved since then.

Soon after deployment of cable modems began in southern Ontario, I ran
a sniffer on a LANcity/Digital/Bay/Nortel cable modem on Rogers Cable
and found pretty much what I expected: Ethernet broadcasts (e.g.,
ARP.)  Once in a while things misfired badly, e.g. a cable modem user
would try to connect a home network to the cable modem and their DHCP
server would answer their neighbours' requests for IP addresses(!),
but this seems to have stopped completely years ago (though I don't
know how -- perhaps the operators disabled layer 2 forwarding between
subscribers.)

Later (and perhaps out of the foolish desire to do something different
and learn from it) I subscirbed to Bell Canada's "Sympatico High Speed
Edition" DSL service and was issued a Nortel "1 Meg Modem"(*) and,
much to my surprise, running a sniffer on it I never saw any traffic
that wasn't meant for me.

Of course, this really isn't all that differrent (except for speed)
from dialing into an ISP -- or even connecting an office to one through
more traditional means, such as ISDN or leased lines.  No matter what
your connection, IP connectivity to the internet means that millions
of people can attempt to exploit your security vulnerabilities.

(*) The Nortel "1 Meg Modem", for those who don't know, was a nifty
design that allowed Nortel DMS line card drawers to be upgraded to
DSLAMs by replacing the standard Bus Interface Card ("BIC") with a
Data-enhanced Bus Interface Card ("DBIC") and using DSL-enhanced line
cards.  While its market was obviously limited to COs that used Nortel
switches, I believe that it failed (I believe that the product line
became a victim of Nortel's struggle to survive) even in that market
segment because it was a proprietary, 1.3 Mbps maximum, system that
became unattractive as high-speed and interoperrable systems emerged.

The basic issue that the UK Competition Commission is investigating is
an important one in need of redress. The charges for terminating calls
to mobiles in the UK are exorbitant and excessive. It costs more to
call a mobile than to call most countries on the other side of the
world.

As for the "less successful" US model, most cellphones come with
bundles of included minutes, often including a larger (if not
unlimited) package of night/weekend minutes, that make it quite
feasible for people to take incoming calls without great concern over
the costs.

Mr. Waverman states the reality quite directly, although he disagrees
with it: "The argument is simple -- the called party cares what he
pays for terminating on his phone but cares little if the calling
party pays for that service. Hence forcing the called party to pay
would eliminate the abuse of the current monopoly termination charge."

I'm not saying that the UK should abandon calling party pays without
another thought. However, it is clear that something needs to be done
to bring market forces to bear on the current scheme of termination
charges. If the threat of throwing wireless party pays into the mix
gets the wireless companies to be a bit more sensible about their
termination charges, then it's all for the better.

I don't see the lunacy.

The case features patent and various trademark-type claims as
well. The DMCA provides one additional (albeit significant) argument -
with the allegation being that Skylink is building devices that break
whatever protection is wrapped around the code-rolling software.  It
would seem to have the basic features of what Congress was intending
with the DMCA: to make technological protections 'stick'.

Further, trying to control a complementary market to one's good (here,
replacement door-opener remotes) is a very standard business tactic.
And one that is implemented via a number of mechanisms: contracts,
technology, and (gasp) intellectual property.  The discipline here is
provided by the market - if Chamberlain uses its control of the
replacement remote market in a way that diminishes the utility (or
raises the overall cost) of their goods, then they'll suffer the
consequences.  (Assuming, of course, that the market for garage-door
opening systems is competitive, which seems a safe assumption.)

In some cases, it can be more efficient to allow the creator of the
original good to control the complementary market; it may allow for
better pricing mechanisms, or some quality benefits.  In other cases,
it's not so good.  But in either event, given reasonable competition in
the market for the original goods, this will get sorted out -- almost
certainly in the consumer's favor.  Here, Chamberlain argues that the
Skylink remotes 'break' the security features of the garage door system.

There are a number of problems with the DMCA.  But I'm not sure this is
one of them, even if one doubts (as I do) whether this move is smart
for Chamberlain's business.

Subject: Apple Silences iTunes P2P Software


By Matthew Broersma and Ian Fried
Special to CNET News.com
January 17, 2003, 10:08 AM PT

Apple Computer has forced a developer to stop distributing a plug-in 
that turned its iTunes music player into peer-to-peer music-sharing 
software.

The plug-in, called iCommune, allowed iTunes users to browse the 
music libraries of other Macintoshes over a network and stream or 
download music from them.

On Wednesday, Apple notified developer James Speth that he was 
violating the terms of his software agreement and ordered him to stop 
distributing the plug-in and to return Apple's development tools. 
Speth removed the iCommune download from his Web site.

Apple's move comes amid increasing hostility between the 
entertainment industry and music-swapping applications such as Kazaa 
and the now-defunct Napster.

However, Apple did not make any direct reference to copyright issues 
in pulling the plug on iCommune. Instead, the company said that Speth 
broke the terms of the agreement that allowed him access to the 
iTunes software development tools. Apple makes those tools available 
to those that want to make their hardware compatible with iTunes but 
not to software makers that want to tap into iTunes.

That varies a lot from system to system.  The peak speed of cable
modems is higher, but the practical speed depends more on how
congested your provider's connection to the outside world is than the
speed of individual links.  For example, the TW system around here has
a nominal speed of 27Mb (megabits, not megabytes) but the outside
connection was originally a pair of T1's which meant the real max
speed was 3Mb if you were the only one using it, which you never were.

Not so.  With cable modems, each branch of the network is logically an
Ethernet, while with DSL each line logically runs straight into the
router.  If you have an older (pre-DOCSIS, I think) cable system that
doesn't encrypt its traffic, it's quite possible to share files and
printers with your neighbors and snoop on all the traffic on your
branch.  Since DSL is routed, the only traffic on your line is yours.
In practice, if you have enough sense to turn on the default firewall
in Windows XP or use something like Zonealarm on older systems, it
doesn't matter.

Two cable providers here (no DSL providers).  One provider (municipal
utility) offers 384/128kbps for $44.95.  Other one (Mediacom) offers
1.4Mbps/128kbps for $39.95.  Both of those can be had for $10 less if
you take their respective cable tv offerings.  1.5Mbps seems plenty
fast for most stuff, the upload of 128kbps is a tad slow sometimes,
especially when I'm transferring large photos to shutterfly.com to be
printed.

The Network Neighborhood thing is pretty much a myth, I believe.  The
DOCSIS specification allows the modem to ONLY talk to the CMTS, so it
would take a gross misconfiguration for people to see other computers,
or so I'm told by one of the local cable operators.  They do filter
some ports (139 and maybe others) that Windows uses for networking.  I
was unable to find any computers in Network Neighborhood when I tried
it (tried it with both systems, I switched to the faster one the day
it rolled out, was customer #1).  I installed a Linux firewall a few
days after getting cable internet service and it definitly blocks any
windows networking from entering or leaving the WAN ethernet port.

FWIW, I've had only one outage since May, which was caused by a McLeod
USA fiber cut, on my Mediacom modem.  It lasted several hours while
the fiber got spliced.  (Okay, I've had a few 3 minute outages this
week while they are doing some work on the cable lines on by block but
that doesn't really count).  My old service was down several times a
week as the guys running it were quite clueless about cable internet
and had a crappy backbone provider besides.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note:  I never really, in my younger days
ever thought the time would come when some people would consider 128
kbps would be a 'tad slow' ... and regards system outages, my DSL
service from Southwestern Bell is quite reliable. I don't think I have
ever had any outages I could blame on the DSL connection.   PAT]

They did at least update the hoax with the new area codes for BVI and
Jamaica. Why Jamaica, though, and not the Bahamas? Hmm. Of course, one

Reply-To: Telecom@LincMad.com


I recently updated the LincMad.com web site. There's very little news
in the area code split end of things, but there are two specific
changes relating to the site itself.

First, the e-mail address "webmaster" is being discontinued due to the
overwhelming volume of spam and virus e-mail. There are several
viruses out that specifically target "webmaster@yourdomain.com"
addresses, including some that send themselves as many as 100 times a
day. There's just nothing quite like opening up your mailbox to see 67
copies of the Friendship Screen Saver, when you've only been away from
your e-mail for the 8 hours you were asleep.

The new address for e-mail related to the web site is "contact" at
LincMad d0t com. Please DO NOT put any "clickable" links to this
address on any web page or Usenet article. Note that I've spelled out
"at" and "d0t" to make it more difficult for e-mail harvesting
programs to parse.

The second item, though, is that I have started a new page about the
banes of the e-mail world: spam, viruses, and virus hoaxes. I don't
expect to have anything more than a cursory explanation, plus links to
other sites for further reading.

However, one new link that I will be adding over the weekend is to a
wonderful anti-spam software company, Matterform. I've been using their
Spamfire product for the Macintosh (not yet available for MS-Windows,
although some of their other stuff is), and it does a remarkably good
job of trapping most of my spam. I refine the filters to cut down the
false negatives and false positives, but that process is simple and
straightforward. One of my favorite features, though, added just a few
days ago, is called "Bug the Web Bugs." It scans your recent spam
messages for "web bugs," replaces the identifier with either random
characters or your choice of friendly message, and then sends your
valuable marketing data to the spammers, over and over and over again.
I particularly enjoy finding a spammer whose web bug rot-13 encodes the
victim's e-mail address, because then I can insert a pleasant hello
message that the spammer won't see until he decodes the rot-13.

If you have other anti-spam, anti-virus, or anti-virus-hoax links to
suggest, please make a note of the new "contact" address, or reply to
this message.

The last time I dumped an old machine, I took it to the landfill with
the rest of the trash.  I waited till the crusher (that huge tractor
like thing with the huge steel rimmed spiked wheels was rolling over
and mashing all the trash our way, and threw the box with the drive
under the wheels.  Maybe it's not as good as NSA-style sanitizing, but
I think it was adequate (considering that there was nothing on that
drive worth the attention of the NSA or any government or civil agency
at all).

When I get rid of a system the drive gets physically destroyed. At this 
point drives are so cheap just let the buyer get their own. 

The process I use is:

1) Pass a bulk eraser over the drive SEVERAL times. 

2) Use a sledge hammer and break the drive into as many small pieces as 
you can. 

Perfectly unrecoverable at that point.

Because they don't know any better, that's why. And those who do (or
should know better -- like the folks in corporate tech services) don't
have the time.

Remember, once you "delete" a file (under DOS/Windows) and clear the
recycle bin, you can't get the files back using the base operating
system tools. The fact that the data is still there escapes the notice
of most people.

Personally, I use compress and clear on occassian and have written my
own file overwrite deletion program. I replaced a failing hard drive
(striction) recently. No one will ever read that drive -- not after
several rounds of high power rifle ammo went through it.

Yes, Monty posts a lot of stuff, of which maybe 10% is of interest to
me.  That 10% makes it worth having, I don't have to download the
bodies for the posts that don't appear interesting from the subject
line.

Pat - 

First let me say how much I've enjoyed reading your comments / tales
from telecom's older days. Once I get out of academia and can afford
to, I will gladly "donate".

On topic -- I was having the same thoughts earlier, especially since
90% of Monty's stuff I've already seen elsewhere (often a day or two
earlier). I do appreciate his posts for the 10% that I haven't seen.

I'm not positive this will work universially -- especially those who
receive the telecom digest via email -- but a happy medium may be to
psuedo thread the messages, so that one can "mark thread as read". To
do this (based on my experimentation) you would just (automatically, I
presume) add a References: (something) header, where (something) was
say "monty".

As far as I can tell some newsreaders thread based on subject, some
based on the references. In therory, a news reader that threades based
on the references would put all of Monty's in the same thread (because
they all referenced the same imaginary article)...

Regardless of what you decide to do, it seems like its starting to get
overwhelming.

One man's clutter is another's bread and butter.  I enjoy Mr. Solomon's
contributions.  He knows the value of brevity.  Actually, I wonder when
he has the time to read all these publications for which he provides
pointers.  I think many readers like me would enjoy a few words about
Mr. Solomon's life and career.

Monty's news items are mostly on-topic and a few are even ones I
haven't already seen ten times - but there has been such a flood
lately that I recently gave up and killfiled him.  If he doesn't want
us all doing that, he might want to put a keyword in his subject lines
that allows a filter to distinguish the news articles from the rest,
just as the "ICB Toll Free" and "Telecom Update (Canada)" people did
some time ago.

Hello,

I like the Solomon posts even though I know what the poster is saying.
Like most people I don't have time to keep track of all the tech
things I would like to, much less anything else.  The Solomon posts
help in that I can recognize by the subject something which might be
very interesting but which wouldn't be brought to my attention
otherwise.

Just my two cents.

Is the log file for the win2k box a text file?  If so, have you used
the gnu utilities for dos/windows which mimic the un*x commands?
Their "tail" command is part of their textutils group.  Information
about this plus downloading info can be found at:

      http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils

If you haven't used these I'm sure that you're going to find them to
be a relief to have around.

   It's actually a "posix" utility.  I.e. Unix (TM of owner-du-jour)
and Unix-like OS's, including linux, HP-UX, IBM-AIX, etc, etc.  Go to
http://www.cygwin.com and get Cygwin.  It's a free bash-emulator for
Windows.  tail, cut, paste, grep, the whole 9 yards.  *NOTE* the
default install does *NOT* put in all the utils.  You want to force
the full install.

   Because it's an emulation layer, I find things slower going through
large files than a comparable machine running linux or whatever.  But
it does do the job.  I work in a scientific-support environment, and I
have occasion to slice+dice large text files ... and the workplace
policy is WIndows XP.  Cygwin is a way to re-use your shell-scripts
verbatim.

   If you *REALLY* wnat to push things, you can download developer
modules and actually build programs like mutt, sendmail, etc under the
NT branch (NT/W2K/XP) of Windows whilst pretending to be under linux.
The main problem is tweaking the configure/makefiles so that they
don't detect that you're running under Windows.

Well ... 

Your ability do do this <EASILY> is limited by how cooperative the
"owning" software is (the "owner" is the software that opened the file
first), more than anything else. Much of the time when a file is
opened in any windows environment it is "locked", prohibiting anything
else from opening it.

There is a way to cheat, and get an unlocked copy of a locked file.
All you have to do is manually (or programatically) copy the file. For
some reason in windows you can copy a file any time you want,
including when it is locked, and when you're finished with it just
delete the copy.

That being said, the way Windows file management works I doubt you
could get real time information out of a file ... The best idea I have
is something with a timer that every X seconds copies the file (to
defeat locks), sees if its the same size as the last file, if it isn't
it does something, then deletes the copy.

If you can't find anything, please feel free to contact me by email at

probably wack something together in a few minutes.

It generally used to be true, but not much anymore. I believe the
DOCSIS 1.1 standard addressed this issue. Otherwise, I would suggest
deciding on a service based on reliability and support of the
provider.

I would avoid SBC DSL, because they *never* have a problem -- just ask
them. I started with cable about 3 years ago. First, it was AT&T, then
switched to Charter.

AT&T had a problem they ignored for a couple of months regarding a 
saturated DS3 between St. Louis and Kansas City. They finally added 
another. Service was unbearably slow during periods of heavy traffic. 

Now I've got Charter, and the local reliability has been very good.
However, regionally, they have a single physical path to their
distribution point. There is no physical route diversity. Bad network
design to be sure. Occasionally this fiber is damaged, or some other
trouble occurs for one reason or another and cable TV and internet
service is out for a period of hours.

OTOH, I've spent more time arguing with SBC DSL tech support in a
month than I've spent talking to Charter tech support in the 2 years
that I've had them. SBC insisted that the problem was not theirs until
the customer decided to drop DSL.

Subject: Problems with AT&T Wireless GSM service


I have been having a strange problem with voicemail on AT&T Wireless's
new GSM service.  I have not been able to resolve it with AT&T yet.

I have busy call forwarding and no answer call forwarding from my
office phone to my AT&T Wireless GSM phone. I noticed that in some
cases, when a call rang through from my office number to the GSM phone
voice mail, I would get the generic, "Welcome to AT&T Wireless
Services voicemail. To enter your mailbox, press '#'...".  In other
words, it appears that when the call was received by the voicemail
system, it could not figure out the correct mailbox.  After conducting
a series of experiments, I was able to establish a pattern.

Before explaining the results, I need to explain my understanding of
how call forwarding and voicemail work.  When a call is placed from
number "A" to "B", and "B" is forwarded to "C", when the call is
delivered to "C's" switch from "B's" switch, 3 numbers are passed:

	Called Party Number (CPN)
	Original Called Party Number (OCPN)
	Redirecting Number (RN)

CPN is the number the call is being placed to. The OCPN is the
original number that was dialed, regardless of how many times the
call has been forwarded. The RN is the last number the call passed
through, i.e. the one that is forwarding to the CPN.

In my above example, CPN is "C", OCPN is "B", and RN is "B".

When a call rings to voicemail, it is simply busy/no answer call
forwarding to a number that rings into the voicemail system.  My guess
is that it determines the mailbox from the RN.  I cannot see that
either of the other two numbers would work, especially considering the
case where a call is forwarded through more than one number.

I conducted test calls through various paths of busy, no answer, or
unconditional call forwarding.  The results were as follows:

     ofc         wireless
  no answer ---> no answer---> correct
     CF             CF         mailbox

     ofc         wireless
  no answer --->   busy*  ---> correct
     CF             CF         mailbox

     ofc         wireless
    busy    ---> no answer---> failed
     CF             CF

     ofc         wireless
    busy    --->   busy   ---> failed
     CF             CF

     ofc         wireless
unconditional--> no answer---> failed
     CF             CF

     ofc         wireless
unconditional-->   busy   ---> correct
     CF             CF         mailbox

I tried these several times to make sure this was not random.

(* It was hard to force busy call forwarding on the GSM service. If
you had a call in progress to the phone, and initiated another
answering it through call waiting, I expected all other calls to go
via busy call forwarding. Wrong. When a third call was placed, it
showed on the display, although it seemed it could not be answered
unless one of the other calls was terminated.  It took a fourth call
to go through busy call forwarding!)

These results are freaky.  I was guessing between the GSM switch and
voicemail, something was getting munged.  But, would it not have to be
the GSM switch munging the RN, or the voicemail system munging it or
doing something else wrong?

In a possibly related problem, when I used this phone in Europe last
December, when calls sent to the phone went unanswered, it was sent to
the voicemail system, and the result was the same failure; it got the
generic "Welcome to AT&T" message. Calls to customer service were met
with, "yeah, we know there is some problem with voicemail."

Any ideas on this are welcome. For anyone clueful at AT&T Wireless,
any intervention is welcome. Front-line customer service still want to
delete and recreate my mailbox.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: I had a situation somewhat similar with
a voicemail service from Ameritech. I had two actual numbers (call
them 9210 and 9211. They were both listed in the directory for
different 'departments'.) Originally there was a hunt group where 9210
would ring 9211 if 9210 was busy. If 9211 was busy, that was it. I had
voicemail put on 9211 so that if it was busy (or if 9210 rolled over
and got a busy 9211) the call would go to voicemail. If someone dialed
direct into 9211 and it was busy or did not answer, voice mail knew
exactly what to do. Then I told Ameritech I wanted to change the
system by also having voicemail on 9210, *and* having 9211 'hunt
backwards' as needed. Now everyone got two chances to get in, with
9210 rolling ONCE and stopping if 9211 was busy. 9211 rolled back
to 9210 and if it was busy, the call also went to voicemail. That's
where the problem started. When 9210 rolled to 11 and then voicemail, 
the VM did not know who was calling, and vice versa. 

Finally telco said what they would do is have *one* box on 9210 with
9211 'aliased' to 9210. *Anytime* 9211 called for voicemail service
the system said 9211 is the same (for VM purposes) as 9210. I could
use either line and get my voicemail. 

In your application, someone, somewhere is passing an 'incorrect' (to
voicemail's and your) point of view. The VM is saying what do I do
with this and gives it a generic greeting. See if you can figure out,
using caller-ID boxes what is actually being passed in each of those
cases you described above. Then advise telco you want any or all of
those unidentified (to VMs point of view) numbers to be 'aliased' to 
the correct number. Is somewhere a DID number or the original caller's
number being handed over to VM who knows nothing about them?  If your
wireless number is X, I assume X should always be what is handed to
the VM. By a series of tests some number (other than X) is getting to
the VM now and then. Keep us posted.  PAT]

Thanks for your responses.

I may be using an incorrect term when I say ANI because I know some
numbers such as 800's **DO** get the caller's billing info.

Before I understood why they do this, I once had a mail order company
ask all kinds of questions about my telephone account such as how it
is listed, actual billing name, etc. I thought they were just trying
to get the information from me under the guise of saying they had to
verify everything so I gave incorrect information and the rep.
immediately knew this and said my response did not match what he
showed on his screen [my phone was listed at that time under someone
else's name] and I had to then give the correct info. which he
obviously did have because he was able to tell when I gave him the
accurate name. The billing info. on my credit card was different from
the info. on my phone account so that was why they were asking, but
they did have everything just by my having made the call as I had
never delt with this company before and certainly had never given them
my ph. co. info.

This call was from a landline phone as oppsosed to a cell phone but
with all the new technology I was curious as to how much info. goes
out with cell calls.

Thanks again for all your help.

I came across this website:   www.vonage.com

The basic offer is a U.S. local telephone line in any one of a number
of areas, accessible to you anywhere in the world by way of the
Internet, so long as one has a DSL/Broadband connection.  A flat
monthly fee of $39.95 provdes unlimited local and long-distance calls
within the U.S., international calls billed at normal rates, and the
ability for anyone to reach you anywhere in the world on your
U.S. number.

I'd be interested if anyone is already using this service, or has any
experience of it, especially from the point of view of using it from
overseas.

Subject: Mobile Phonecos Braced for Tough Price Cuts


By Tim Richardson

It appears that the UK's mobile phone operators have lost their fight 
to stave off enforced price cuts following a year-long investigation 
by the Competition Commission.

The FT reports that termination charges - the fees service providers
charge for routing calls from other operators through their networks -
could be slashed by 15 per cent with a further 14 per cent reduction
over three years.

Any price cuts would be implemented from April, according to the newspaper.

Register.com Inc yesterday rejected an unsolicited takeover bid that

structurally inadequate", claiming the potential buyer was trying to
pressure the company to sell cheap, writes Kevin Murphy.

RCM Acquisition Co LLC's offer of $4.95 cash per share, representing a

Register.com has to grow value for our stockholders," said
Register.com executive chairman Mitchell Quain.

"Gobbles", the German hacker who improbably claimed to have infected

Subject: Judge to Hear Air ID Challenge


By Julia Scheeres
02:00 AM Jan. 18, 2003 PT

San Francisco -- A U.S. District Court judge agreed to hear a
challenge to an airline requirement that forces passengers to show
identification before boarding a plane, despite a motion by the
government and two airlines to dismiss it.

John Gilmore, the co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, 
has sued United Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Attorney General 
John Ashcroft, alleging that the ID requirement stems from a "secret 
law" that violates his right to anonymous travel within the United 
States.

The case stems from two July 4 incidents in which Gilmore refused to 
show his ID at San Francisco and Oakland airports before boarding 
cross-country flights. Southwest refused to let him board without 
identifying himself, while United said he could board if he submitted 
to a hand search, which he refused.

Gilmore, a longtime libertarian, arrived at the federal building
wearing Birkenstocks and a purple suit jacket. Pinned to the lapel,
was a button with the words "suspected terrorist" superimposed over
the shape of an airplane.

Subject: A Sinking Feeling at the Register


By DAVID LEONHARDT

ONE year ago, a 50-inch Hitachi television cost $1,400 at Circuit 
City. It costs $1,000 today.

Five years ago, automakers charged $25,500 for the average new 
vehicle. They charge about $24,500 today.

A decade ago, a round trip on Delta Air Lines between New York and 
San Francisco cost $388 - and it was part of a sale. Delta now sells 
the same advance-purchase ticket for $317.

Most stunning is the price path of Burger King's Whopper sandwich, 
which cost about $1.40 some 20 years ago, when the Dow Jones 
industrial average hovered around 1,000 and hourly wages were about 
one-half their current level. This weekend, a Whopper sells for 99 
cents.

Deflation, a sustained decline in prices across the economy, remains 
merely a threat, with overall prices still rising mildly. For some of 
the nation's largest industries, though, falling prices are a 
reality. The costs of cars, clothing, electronics, furniture, 
jewelry, kitchen equipment and toys - indeed, of most manufactured 
goods - have been dropping for more than a year, causing turmoil for 
companies and their workers. Although airlines and fast food are 
among the only industries in the service sector to be suffering 
through declines, overall service prices are rising more slowly than 
they were two years ago, according to figures released last week.

Subject: World Ports Using Electronic Security System to Fight Terrorism


By Gene Johnson, Associated Press, 1/18/2003

SEATTLE - Eleven of the world's busiest seaports, including New York,
have started using an electronic container security system that was
developed to help the US military keep track of food, ammunition, and
other gear shipped overseas.

The technology, created by Savi Technology of Sunnyvale, Calif.,
relies on electronic seals placed on container closures. Using radio
signals, the seals can transmit information about where the container
is, what is inside it and whether it has been opened - all crucial to
thwarting smugglers or terrorists.

Subject: Court Rules Against Network Associates' Software Review Policy


By MATT RICHTEL

New York court has ruled that Network Associates, a maker of popular 
antivirus and computer security software, may not require people who 
buy the software to get permission from the company before publishing 
reviews of its products.

The decision, which the company has vowed to appeal, could carry a 
penalty in the millions of dollars, according to Ken Dreifach, chief 
of the Internet bureau of the office of the New York State attorney 
general, Eliot Spitzer.

Last spring, Mr. Spitzer sued Network Associates, which has its 
headquarters in Santa Clara, Calif., asserting that the company's 
software included an unenforceable clause that effectively violated 
consumers' free speech. The clause, which appeared on software 
products and the company's Web site, read: "The customer will not 
publish reviews of this product without prior consent from Network 
Associates Inc."

In a decision the parties received late Thursday, Justice Marilyn 
Shafer of State Supreme Court in Manhattan ruled that the clause was 
deceptive and that it warranted a fine, which she wrote that she 
would determine in the future.

Subject: 802.11g Update


By Adam Engst and Glenn Fleishman (1/17/2003)

In 2002, Wi-Fi -- mostly in the form of 802.11b equipment -- ruled the
land. The faster, 54 megabit-per-second (Mbps) 802.11a devices that
shipped during 2002 seemed interesting, but because they used a
different frequency than 802.11b and also cost more, only a small
number of early adopters and testers bought in.

More promisingly, 802.11g winked at us from the horizon. That standard
runs, like 802.11a, at 54 Mbps but with full backward compatibility
with 802.11b. Because of political and technical conflicts, the
specification's IEEE committee work dragged on, but a final version
appears likely to be ratified by summer or fall 2003.

Technology doesn't wait for engineering groups, though: against some
industry experts' better judgment, several companies have started to
ship equipment based on chipsets that use a draft version of 802.11g
to achieve the higher speed and better indoor signal characteristics.

Apple, of course, was one of the first out of the gate -- just like
with 802.11b -- announcing new products under the AirPort Extreme name
in January 2003 at the Macworld Expo. But Linksys, Buffalo, and Belkin
 -- in roughly that order -- beat Apple to the punch by shipping a
variety of gateways and adapters in December 2002 and January 2003,
but Apple has released substantially more detail about their equipment
while also offering a few interesting features in their new wireless
gateway that may tempt people with no Macintoshes in sight.

In this addendum to The Wireless Networking Starter Kit, we discuss 
the forward and backwards compatible issues with 802.11g and Apple's 
AirPort Extreme, and run through Apple and other vendor's equipment.

Subject: Microsoft Introduces CD Copy-Protection "Fix"


By Bernhard Warner, European Internet Correspondent

    CANNES, France, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT)
announced on Saturday the introduction of new digital rights software
aimed at helping music labels control unauthorized copying of CDs, one
of the biggest thorns in the ailing industry's side.

    Stung by the common practice of consumers copying, or "burning,"
new versions of a store-bought CD onto recordable CDs, music companies
have invested heavily in copy-protection technologies that have mainly
backfired or annoyed customers.

    For example, most copy-proof CDs are designed so that they cannot
be played on a PC, but often this prevents playback on portable
devices and car stereos too.

    Last year, some resourceful software enthusiasts cracked Sony
Music's (TOKYO:6758) proprietary technology simply by scribbling a
magic marker pen around the edges of the disc, thus enabling playback
on any device.

    Microsoft believes it may have come up with a solution. The new
software is called the Windows Media Data Session Toolkit.

    It enables music labels to lay songs onto a copy-controlled CD in
multiple layers, one that would permit normal playback on a stereo and
a PC.

    SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 19 (Reuters) - One of the world's most famous
computer hackers gets off probation this week and plans to dive back
into the Internet, his former playground where breaking-and-entering

    On Tuesday, 39-year-old Kevin Mitnick will log on to the Internet

creator of Internet music downloading pioneer Napster, and Steve
Wozniak, a co-founder of Apple Computer Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)

    Mitnick says he is ready to go to work, ironically, in a position

he used to do. He has a job interview scheduled for Monday, but

That's a great technique and I use it also. I have both an IEEE address
and an alumni association address which forward to my real mailbox. But,
when I reply to an incoming message, the recipient will learn, and perhaps
retain, my actual mailbox address. I can change the From: line in my mail
but I have no way to insure that all recipients will pay attention. The
true Sender: address is always there. What's your answer to this problem?

It might be more reliable and more easily accessible.  Reliable in
that the DSL service is dependent on the quality of the phone lines
with their attendant quirks.  More easily accessible in that DSL
service is dependent on distance from the central office.

This is not to discount DSL.  There are some DSL services which
guarantee 765kb/s download/downstream and 256kb/s upload/upstream or
some such number. This is between the residence and the central office
DSLAM (digital subscriber line access multiplier) equipment.

On a cable system you do indeed share bandwidth with those in your
locale.  The cable/broadband access is a shared broadcast medium.  So
in theory you can have your downloads, etc., throttled by whatever
anyone else on the same system is doing.  I've never seen it but my
experience is limited.

Yes, of course.  And it depends on which interface that you expose
those services.  The probable desired setup is to have those services
enabled/visible on the local network within your home, for example,
and hidden from the wider internet.

I guess that the prejudice about cable modem users comes from them
being favored as targets for people trying to break in.  They are most
likely to have their machines "always on" as opposed to a dialup
access user.  Also, someone trying a variety of break-in techniques
enjoys quicker access to the target machine on a cable network than
they would going to a dialup user's machine.

Please correct me if I'm wrong, folks.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Although I have DSL here in Independence
I am always 'on line'. I never turn it off. However I have noticed
that every day or two, sbcglobal.net does play around with the IP 
addresses. Sometimes I get dumped off line for no apparent reason. But
when it is up and running (most of the time) is is pretty fast. I am
only five or six blocks away from Edison CO (620-330/331/332 which
serves Independence) so I get fairly fast service. The only people in
town who cannot get DSL (if they want it) are the folks on the far
north side of town in the area called 'Country Club'. Everyone here in
town is served by 620-331, but they are just a wee bit too far north
to be within the range of DSL.  (620-330 is Montgomery County offices
and a few cell phones such as mine; 620-332 is City of Independence
and a few cell phones and a couple other *large* companies in the
town.)  PAT]

I seem to recall that what the FCC actually said was that forcing cellular
subscribers, but not landline subscribers, to CHANGE to a new area code
was discriminatory.  I doubt they would object to the creation of a new
cellular-only area code if moving into it was voluntary on the part of
the individual cellular subscriber.

However, any such code would suffer from the same problem that killed
AT&T's EasyReach (700/500) service:  Office PBX managers would block
calls to the new code for fear it would be used to offer phone sex.
One can hope that pay phone owners would not block it, though, if the
cost is predictable (say, a national flat rate, as it is in the UK).

That's my understanding too.  If a cellular-only area code were created,
number porting into and out of it would have to be forbidden, but that
is not beyond the realm of possibility.

Subject: Greek Dialing Plan Changes Phase 4


As of January 19, the last change of the new Greek dialing plan is 
in effect. All mobile numbers have the initial 0 replaced by a 6:

Provider   Old Number   New Number
TeleStet   093-1234567  693-1234567
Vodaphone  094-1234567  694-1234567
CosmoOte   097-1234567  697-1234567
Q-Telecom  099-1234567  699-1234567

Beeper numbers have also changed from 0920-123456 to 6920-123456

When calling from abroad, these change consists of the digit 6 being 
added between the country code and the service code, e.g. +30-9x-
yyyyyyy becomes +30-69x-yyyyyyy.

Note the choice of the digit 6 is consistent with the dialing plans 
of France and Spain (and possibly other countries as well).

Subject: Cingular Cellphone Flakiness


My has been having a peculiar problem with her Cingular cellphone 
service on a new GPA Nokia phone. Every so often the phone seems to 
develop amnesia, and won't receive calls. Incoming calls go into 
voice-mail without ringing the phone and the phone can't dial out at 
all (she gets busy signals trying to dial out). She can't access 
voice mail. Pushing options, she gets 0000 and Field Test.

She's taken it back to Cingular a couple of times to have it reset, 
but after several weeks it's back to doing it again.

Has anybody seen these symptoms before? Any idea what they might mean?

Thanks, 

Jeff Hecht

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: You say when dialing out she gets
'busy signals'. Do you mean she gets a rapid busy tone, otherwise
known as a 'no circuits available' tone? The cell tower apparently 
has a limited number of lines available for incoming/outgoing calls, 
and I am sure this is what is happening. When a call comes in, it 
hits that no-circuit condition coming in to the tower and treats it
like any 'busy signal' and transfers the caller to voicemail. Likewise
on her outgoing calls, after she presses 'send' the phone in essence
goes off hook and that fast busy (no circuits tone) greets her. 

That same condition is a regular gripe of people who use Alltel prepaid
cellular service here on the cell tower south of town in Liberty, KS. 
If you complain about it to George, the Alltel sales rep over at
Walmart, he is quick to lay the blame on Southwestern Bell, saying 
'they just won't give us the number of lines we need.'  One day I
asked him about it, complaining on behalf of two of my friends who
because of their youthful age (teenagers) do not qualify for 'regular'
type cell service. Their same youthful age prevents them from knowing
much telco stuff about 'fast busies' for no-circuits, etc. He actually
that day made a call to an Alltel engineer in Little Rock, Arkansas
and reported to me that the egg was on their face that time:  SWB
Telco *had* finished installing a new bank of lines, but had 'forgotten'
to turn the lines on and put them in service. My friends had in turn
been getting complaints from their girl friends who demanded to know
why their lines had been busy all the night before. Alltel only about
a month ago started offering voicemail and caller ID to their prepaid
customers off of the Liberty, Kansas (620-924) cellular tower. But to
hear George tell it earlier, the excuse was 'we cannot force Southwestern
Bell to hurry any faster than they want to'.  

Maybe that's your wife's problem also. PAT]

This article missed one critical area of the Compeition Commission's
work; the review of call charges between mobile networks.

In the UK generally calling an-on network phone from a mobile costs
the same as calling a landline.

Calling an off-network can be between 3 and 10 times more expensive.
OFTEL, the regulator was looking to get operators to slash that
differential.

Subject: Last Laugh! Bible College Shuns 666 Phone Number
Reply-To: joey@garynuman.info


VANCLEVE, Kentucky (AP) -- A small Appalachian Bible college is
fighting to change its telephone number because the 666 prefix is
disturbing to Christians who recognize it as the biblical mark of the
beast.


http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/South/01/18/offbeat.mark.of.the.beast.ap/inde
x.html

(It's odd that they use the language "fighting", since the story goes
on to say that telco is cooperating fully.  Apparently the request for
a new number was made about six months ago, and the story quotes
telco's lawyer as saying the number will be changed as soon as
possible.  It also adds the area got a new prefix, 693, "recently" but
doesn't specify just how recently.)

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Why do you suppose it is there is not
(and is unlikely to ever be) an area code '666'? Same reason. Americans
are very superstitious people. There used to be a (named) exchange in 
Chicago called 'MONroe'.  That got changed, (like all named exchanges)
to the numerical value '666'. Someone started a rumor that the Checker
Taxicab Company was owned and operated by Satan and they (the rumor-
pusher) could 'prove it' since after all, the telephone number to call
for a taxicab was 666-3700. No matter that Checker had had that number
for about 75 years (when they were driving Model-T Fords as taxicabs)
under variations of the 3700 number. In 1920 the taxicab number was
MONroe-3700. Then on to MOnroe-6-3700, and from sometime in the 1970's
when they had occassion to get new cabs or repaint the old ones, the
number was 666-3700.  Unlike 1920, when things were different to say
the least, the Monroe central office general neighborhood has changed
quite drastically. In those days -- the 1920's -- Monroe served a 
mostly white, Jewish neighborhood. Starting sometime in the 1950's the 
Jews all moved out and the neighborhood turned all minority. A very
prominent synagogue in those long ago days had the phone number of
MONroe-1000. When the synagogue closed down and a fundamentalist black
church group took over the building, the first thing they did was get
rid of that 666-1000 phone number. The taxicab people also changed
their number (but partly because the dispatch operation was consoli-
dated with Yellow Cab). Now the two of them use 773-TAXICAB.

Here in Independence, I am told that a Pentacostal Church had been
given the number 1666 years and years ago, and that when dial service
started in the 1950's and it changed to EDison 1-1666 they wanted
*their* number changed. Do not ask me to figure out how people's minds
work. If I could do that and sell my results, I would be a rich man
today.  PAT]

AT&T SETS TRANSITION PLAN: AT&T Canada has received Ontario court
approval for new commercial agreements that allow it to continue to
connect to AT&T Corp's network and use its technology and products. In
addition:

** AT&T Canada will adopt a new brand name by September 9. It
    will cease use of the AT&T name for most purposes by year-
    end, and on calling cards and Internet addresses by June
    30, 2004.

** AT&T Corp. can serve Canadian customers directly,
    including by competing with AT&T Canada.

** AT&T Canada has also received court approval to
    disseminate its restructuring plan to creditors, who will
    vote on it on February 20.

CRTC TO REVIEW TELCO WINBACK PROMOS: Telecom Public Notice 2003-1
invites comment on whether the CRTC should continue to approve winback
promotions by incumbent telcos, "given the state of competition in the
local wireline telephone market."  The Commission has suspended
consideration of new winback proposals in the meantime.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Notices/2003/pt2003-1.htm

DSL WINBACK RULES EXTENDED: CRTC Telecom Decision 2003-1 extends the
DSL winback rule set for Bell Canada last June (see Telecom Update
#339) to Aliant, SaskTel, and Telus. The ruling sets a 90-day
prohibition on trying to win back customers who switch to an ISP that
uses the telco's wholesale DSL service.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Decisions/2003/dt2003-1.htm

Q3 2002 TELECOM STATISTICS RELEASED: Statistics Canada has released
its telecom services report for third quarter 2002.  In the first nine
months of 2002, wireless revenues and profits grew substantially
compared to 2001, while wireline revenues and profits declined,
resulting in essentially flat industry performance. Capital spending
fell 25%.

http://www.statcan.ca:80/Daily/English/030116/d030116a.htm

BELL LAUNCHES SPEECH RECOGNITION: Bell customers in Ontario who dial
the 310-BELL customer service number are now served by a speech
recognition system based on Nuance technology.  The system, dubbed
Emily, will be introduced across the country at a cost of $10 million.

CRAIG, UBS TAKE STAKES IN LOOK: Craig Wireless International has
bought 29.9% of the shares of Look Communications and will buy another
2.6% if the CRTC approves. Unique Broadband Systems has acquired 20%
of Look's shares for $2.3 million.  Craig and Look offer wireless
cable service in Manitoba and Ontario respectively; UBS makes fixed
wireless equipment.  (See Telecom Update #359)

LUCENT WINS BELL DSL CONTRACT: Lucent Technologies has won a
multi-year contract to provide its AnyMedia equipment to Bell Canada,
to expand Bell DSL service in Ontario and Quebec.  Lucent says it's
"our first major inroad into Bell."

GT MEMO SAYS LAYOFF COMPLETED: According to the Toronto Star, Group
Telecom CEO Dan Milliard has told his staff that "there are no
additional headcount reductions planned or scheduled at this time."
GT's sales force is "the core aspect of the business" and will be
retained. (See Telecom Update #361)

PAYPHONE DIRECTORY CHARGE REJECTED, FOR NOW: CRTC Telecom Order
2003-21 rejects a proposal from MTS to charge for directory assistance
from payphones. The Commission says it may revisit the question in a
wider proceeding on payphone pricing.

http://www.crtc.gc.ca/archive/ENG/Orders/2003/o2003-21.htm

GLOBALSTAR FINDS A BUYER: New Valley Corp, a Miami-based investment
company, has agreed to invest US$55 million in satellite phone company
Globalstar LP, now under bankruptcy protection. Subject to court
approval, New Valley will take an 80% stake in the reorganized
company.

ERICSSON, ROGERS AT&T RENEW EQUIPMENT DEAL: Rogers AT&T Wireless has
awarded Ericsson Canada a three-year contract for wireless equipment
and services worth up to $465 million.

TELUS TO OFFER BLACKBERRY ON 1X: Telus Mobility says it will offer a
1XRTT version of the RIM BlackBerry to enterprise customers across
Canada. Although no announcement has been made, Telecom Update has
learned that Bell Canada will offer a similar service in February.

NORTHERN TELEPHONE MODIFIES NAME: Northern Telephone, the BCE-owned
telco in northeast Ontario, has changed its name to
NorthernTel. Nortel Mobility becomes NorthernTel Mobility, and
Logicon, its IT services company, becomes NorthernTel Infosystems.

DAWN HUNT NAMED CHAIR OF CWTA: The Canadian Wireless
Telecommunications Association has named Dawn Hunt as its Chair. Hunt
is Rogers AT&T's VP Government and Intercarrier Relations.

SHAW REPORTS REVENUE, SUBSCRIBER GAINS: Shaw Communications reports
sales of $513 million for the three months ended November 30, 14.5%
higher than a year previously. Shaw's net loss was reduced to $19
million from $55 million. Shaw gained 12,526 cable, 42,616 Internet,
and 19,192 satellite TV subscribers.

COGECO HALTS SUBSCRIBER EROSION: Cogeco Cable added a net 2,809 basic
cable subscribers between August and November, the first increase
since March 2001. Its Internet subscriber total increased
18,250. Revenue of $115 million during the three months was up 1.3%
from the same period a year ago.

CALL NOW FOR ON-SITE CALL CENTRE MANAGEMENT TRAINING: Angus Dortmans
Associates is now scheduling client-site presentations of "Essential
Skills and Knowledge for Incoming Call Centre Management" for
2003. The two-day course has received rave reviews from call centre
managers, team leaders, and support staff across Canada.

I will recommend Cable Internet for people who what ease of
installation and support. With cable you basically just plug it in and
then go.

DSL on the other hand requires an inline filter for every phone, fax,
modem, etc. that is using the phone line and most of the time requires
some spyware dial up software to be installed in your pc for PPPoE
authentication. I have heard that the speed is a little faster if you
are closer to the Telco central office or remote office. But I'm
sticking to cable mostly because I can't stand my local phone company

From: John R Levine <johnl@iecc.com>
Subject: Re: Mobile Operators' Regulatory Time Bomb


I was interested to read Leonard Waverman's piece in the January 13th
Wall Street Journal, commenting on planned changes to the British
mobile phone market, and primarily crediting "calling party pays" for
the success of European mobile telephony.  It seems to me that this is
much too simplistic an analysis, and doesn't consider the important
benefits of the North American system where the subscriber pays any
surcharge.

While Europeans are accustomed to an "everyone pays" system where the
caller pays by the minute for every call, in North America most local
calls are either free or untimed.  As a result, Americans have no
patience for surcharged phone numbers (other than porn, psychics, and
other marginal applications).  The few experiments with caller pays
cellular have been failures, as has been the 500 pseudo-area code,
which was designed for services that would have a small surcharge to
the caller.  It also means that landline service is a much stronger
competitor to cellular in North America than in Europe, since the
price is so low, both for voice calls and for data using flat rate
dialup or DSL Internet service.  It's an important reason for the
failure of text messaging in the U.S., since one of the reasons that
it's so popular in Europe is that it's cheaper than voice calls.

It's true that the uptake of mobile service has been slower in the
U.S.  than in Europe, and that Europe's GSM system is more successful
than American AMPS.  Beyond the fact that we had less pent-up demand
since we already had more landlines in place, the U.S.  divided the
country into hundreds of little mobile service areas and auctioned
each one off separately, which meant that until a few years ago,
roaming outside your local area basically didn't work, and roaming
text messages still are too flaky to depend on.  Compare the
experience in the U.S. with that of Canada, where they awarded a
national franchise to Rogers, and regional franchises to the small set
of incumbent telcos who were already used to working with each other,
and the effect of U.S. fragmentation is clear.

The worldwide success of GSM is easily attributable to the fact that
GSM was designed later than and is technically superior to AMPS. AMPS
couldn't support any sort of data traffic without expensive retrofits,
and now suffers from two incompatible retrofit systems (TDMA and CDMA)
that don't interoperate.

But what of the benefits of the North American system?  I think one
can make a strong case that it was bad public policy in Europe to
design a charging scheme and numbering plan that ensures that mobile
service will always cost more than landline.  The combination of
subscriber pays and our integrated phone numbering means that cellular
and landline compete head-to-head, both in price and service.  In
recent years mobile rates have plunged and increasingly approach
landline-style pricing; for example, I get 250 daytime minutes and
3000 night/weekend minutes for $30/month, of which I rarely use as
much as 200, so my service might as well be flat rate.  

As a result we're now seeing mobile service replace landline service,
particularly for students and others who move frequently.  If the FCC
does its job and makes carriers implement local number portability
between mobile and landline, I'm sure we'll see vast numbers of people
switch to mobile once they can do so without losing the phone numbers
they already have, something that would never be possible if calls to
mobiles weren't interchangable with calls to landlines.  Europeans
certainly sign up for lots of new mobile service, with an oft-used
example being that everyone in rural Scandinavia uses mobile phones,
but that strikes me as much as an indictment of the failure to provide
affordable landline service as a success of mobile.

I'm also surprised that as an economist he's not more troubled by the
ridiculous rates that European carriers charge for inbound calls, due to
the inability of callers to negotiate prices.  It costs me under 6
cents/minute to call a British landline, about the same as to call a U.S.
landline or mobile, but 40 cents to call a British mobile.  That means if
someone in the UK gives me a mobile number to call, I'm inclined to tell
them that if they want to hear from me, give me a real phone number, the
same as if a U.S. correspondent gave me a 500 or 976 number.  I doubt I'm
the only person who feels this way, and arranging for subscribers to pay
the rates for the service they choose, as they do here, is the
straightforward way to introduce competitive pricing.

Finally, the argument that high inbound rates are beneficial because they
permit carriers to hand out lots of subsidised phones is unpersuasive.
For one thing, subsidies don't depend on inbound charges.  My carrier
currently offers a Motorola C331t phone for free or a Nokia 3360 for $30
if you sign up for a year or two of service, which is typical of the
subscriber-pays deals here.  And if the goal is to encourage providers to
hand out subsidized phones, why stop at the halfway point of sticking
landline users with a charge only on inbound calls?  Charge the same
inflated rates to recipients of outbound calls, thereby relieving mobile
users of paying anything at all, and every man, woman, child, dog, cat,
and parakeet in the country will soon have a phone.  But I hope not.

A friend of mine (Bob Frankston, one of the great nerds of all time)
is using it and thinks it's great.  They provide a Cisco phone to
Ethernet adapter into which you plug a phone.  If you have a phone
number in one of the areas where they provide service you can port
that number to their system, otherwise they'll issue you a new number.
They don't support 911 and the phone stops working if the power fails,
so it's not a good choice for your only telephone.

Their terms of service say that it's NOT supported outside the U.S.
and although they'll let you sign up, it's completely at your own
risk.  There's no technical reason it shouldn't work from the UK,
although I'd think the transatlantic link would add significant extra
delay, making calls sound lousy.

Regular phone calls between the US and UK are now so cheap that you'd
have to spend over 8 hours a month on the phone to make their $26/mo
service cheaper than just calling with one of the widely available
3p/min plans.  Unless you need a US phone number, I don't see the
point.

  I was told by an expert (who is at http://alan.clegg.com/802/ ) that
some wireless access points have a way to set their output power
level, and that it is a good idea to set it to the minimum which will
cover your premises.

  This decreases the chance that someone outside can eavesdrop.

Yes, but you may be sharing a lot more bandwidth than you think.  I
was speaking with a 3rd level technician a few months ago who noted
that in Houston on a Time Warner cable system, even if everyone on the
system "clicked on a link" at the same time, they'd only use something
like less than 40% of the bandwidth they had on the system, and that
he had spent several days the previous month setting at various nodes
around town measuring throughout vs usage, so it sounds like they
actually care here in Houston.  Checking bandwidth to a Time Warner
site (which would only measure speed along the shared neighborhood
lines) has always shown me to be within a few percent of the stated
speed (1.5 Mb/s).

Here in Houston, it seems most of the outlying areas cannot have DSL.
At least, everyone I know South and Southwest of town say they only
have broadband internet access via the cable modem service in their
neighborhood.  Up until a few months ago, I could not even get above
22k with a modem connection because of the poor phone line quality --
and I'm in a brand new neighborhood that was just wired less than two
years ago.

My cable modem connection is up [i.e. I can see a number of key
internet sites] 99.3% of the time (and I run software that constantly
monitors it, so I can note this with confidence).

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It is interesting how different things
can be, depending on where you are at. Here, if your phone is 620-331
(which is everyone) you can have DSL except for the far north edge of
town (Country Club area). Of course this is a smaller town (two miles
long by a mile and a half wide). Some people choose to get their DSL
from the local ISP's 'competing' phone company, but thats really a
sort of joke. The ISP brokers it in bulk from the 'real' telco and the
rich people out around the Country Club area still cannot get it even
through the 'competitor', since the competitor uses Bell wires and
cables, etc and is merely co-located with Bell over at 6th and Maple
Streets. As far as cable modem is concerned, it does not exist.  There
is none. We had Time Warner here from the beginning of cable TV service
and if anyone asked the lady in the Time Warner office downtown about
cable modem service she would say 'well, maybe someday'. About six
months ago she started saying 'it will be here next year'. Then as of
January 1, the local Time Warner office became a new company 'Cable
One' (same lady sitting in the office; her husband still drives the
truck around town and maintains the cable wires but in a new truck
instead of the old Time Warner one) and on cable TV they are now
giving advertisements saying 'cable modem will start sometime in the
first quarter of this year.' I do not know whether I will switch to it
or not ... I know if I try it, I will have it turned on and make sure
it works right *before* I turn off the sbcglobal.net DSL line. Maybe
I will keep them both for awhile and see which one I like best. PAT]

It is only necessary to guess which station has the most listeners at
a given moment.  Absolute accuracy is not important.  You really only
need to determine the band with the most power.

  Subject: Novelist John le Carre slams Bush "Junta" in Iraq

The United States of America Has Gone Mad
John le Carre

America has entered one of its periods of historical madness, but this
is the worst I can remember: worse than McCarthyism, worse than the
Bay of Pigs and in the long term potentially more disastrous than the
Vietnam War.

The reaction to 9/11 is beyond anything Osama bin Laden could have
hoped for in his nastiest dreams. As in McCarthy times, the freedoms
that have made America the envy of the world are being systematically
eroded. The combination of compliant US media and vested corporate
interests is once more ensuring that a debate that should be ringing
out in every town square is confined to the loftier columns of the
East Coast press.

The imminent war was planned years before bin Laden struck, but it was
he who made it possible. Without bin Laden, the Bush junta would still
be trying to explain such tricky matters as how it came to be elected
in the first place; Enron; its shameless favouring of the already-too-
rich; its reckless disregard for the world's poor, the ecology and a
raft of unilaterally abrogated international treaties. They might also
have to be telling us why they support Israel in its continuing
disregard for UN resolutions.

Now is the time to get protected.

The reason is believed to be the new porn scandal which is making
everyone more aware of the risks of being investigated. If you havent
already heard, there are a staggering 300,000 suspects on the list, So
far, more than 1300 arrests have been made including a judge,
magistrates, senior public school teachers and 50 police officers.

Privacy invaders are like termites. They undermine, eating away at the
structure of your personal life, until you wake up one day and realize
that the foundation is gone.

The American Civil Liberties Union, battling harder than ever for your
basic rights against increasingly nosy corporate and government
snoops, has issued a report that should be raising alarms everywhere.
The bottom line is evident in the title: "Bigger Monster, Weaker
Chains: The Growth of an American Surveillance Society."

We're inundated with examples of this or that invasion of privacy, the
ACLU says. The current villain is the Pentagon's "Total Information
Awareness" project, which would scoop up all kinds of public and
private personal data to look for hints of bad activity including
terrorism, according to its Big-Brotherish planners.

The individual threats are bad enough, the report says, but consider 
the bigger picture.

"Too many people still do not understand the danger, do not grasp just
how radical an increase in surveillance by both the government and the
private sector is becoming possible, or do not see that the danger
stems not just from a single government program, but from a number of
parallel developments in the worlds of technology, law and politics."

The best way to slow this erosion is to change laws, the ACLU says.
That means you have to be politically active if you care about
protecting what's left of your privacy, much less getting back any of
what you've already lost.

It's getting late.

My experience with Rat Shack here in Calgary isn't quite as bad, but
still annoying.  Generally, buying some batteries for cash is an
in-the-door, out-the-door proposition.  Buying anything more than that
 -- for example, I recently bought a laser pointer (as a toy for my
cats -- they *LOVE* chasing that red dot!) -- and you get the request
for all that personal info.

I simply answer "I'm sorry, I don't give that out" and the response
(from Radio Shack employees) has always been "that's quite alright" and
the transaction proceeds without it.  Getting asked is annoying, but at
least they don't make you feel bad about it.

Not so at Future Shop, a national electronics chain which is now part
of the (if I recall correctly) US "Best Buy" empire.  They, too, want
your name and address and phone number on pretty much any non-trivial
transaction.  Most of the time they're ok with it when I tell 'em I
don't give it out.  Some ask me (just out of curiosity, while the
transaction is proceeding) why, and I tell 'em that every time I give
it out, ESPECIALLY to Future Shop, I start getting a lot more of
addressed-directly-to-me junk mail.  Most feign surprise: apparently,
the company tells the sales droids that this information is NOT used
for marketing, but I'm here to tell you that it is.  I mean, what
*OTHER* legitimate reason is there for them to compile such a dossier
on their customers?

Some Future Shop employees, though, get downright surly about it,
trying to make me feel somehow guilty about not allowing them to do
their job properly.

This isn't the end of it, though.  Most of the time, if your purchase
is medium to large (for example, a new DVD player), they start pushing
the extended warranty on you.  Basically this involves a sales pitch
telling you just what a complete pile of crap the product you're buying
is, and that you're absolutely nuts not to buy some extra protection
($40 on a $240 DVD player).  Generally speaking, if a product fails
within the normal warranty but after 15 days from sale, you're on your
own to get warranty support from the manufacturer.  With extended
warranty, you bring the product back to Future Shop (in the case of
large items, like a widescreen projection TV, they'll come to your
house) and they'll repair or replace it.

Here's the rub: you CANNOT have their extended warranty protection
without giving up your name, address, and phone number.  Now, you can
get away with a fake address and phone number (but the address better
be right if you expect on-site service), but the name has to match the
name on the credit card you're paying with.  Otherwise, no sale.

Fun.

Despite it all, I keep going back because generally speaking they've
got pretty good pricing -- but I've reached the point that their price
has to be SIGNIFICANTLY better than other retailers before I'll buy
from them.  On one visit, I was buying a DSL router and a hunk of
ethernet cable.  The sales droid (who works on a commission basis)
kept pushing and pushing for my personal information, and I kept
refusing, less and less politely each time.  Finally I said, "look,
I'm not giving you that information, and if it's a problem, I'll take
my business elsewhere."

That made him back off.  That is, until it came time to start pushing
the extended warranty on me.  I was already annoyed with the guy, so
when he started with the very-familiar push, I said firmly, "no, I
don't want the extended warranty."  That didn't stop him.  Now he
wants to explain just why he feels I'm making a mistake.  I
interrupted him again: "I'm quite familiar with the extended warranty
plan, and I'm not interested.  You're also very close to talking
yourself out of a sale."

You'd think that would do it.  Nope.  He said, "why wouldn't you want
the peace of mind that the extended warranty brings?"

At that point, I put the equipment I was trying to purchase gently onto
the floor, turned around, and walked directly out the door.  I found
what I was looking for over at Staples for only $2 more and no
intrusive questioning.

I've since been back a couple of times, once to buy about $500 worth
of DSL modems.  He hovered, waiting to pounce on me, but I waited
until he was momentarily distracted by another sales droid.  I swooped
in, grabbed the modems, and walked directly to the checkout.  Halfway
there he caught up with me and asked if I wanted any help.  "Not from
you, buddy" was my reply.  He walked away -- FINALLY getting the
message.

Now, having outlined some bad experiences, let me say something good
about some internet retailers.  Specifically, Future Shop's website
(futureshop.ca), Amazon.ca (also amazon.com and amazon.co.uk), and
chapters.ca.  I've purchased from all of these e-tailers, and as part
of the transaction they do ask for your email address, shipping
address, etc.  I've been dealing with them for about three or fourn
years now.  When I give them my email address, I give them a special,
only-for-e-tailers email address (a different one for each e-tailer) -
the idea being, if they sell access to their database, I should find
out about it pretty quickly.  And in those three or four years, I've
had exactly zero spam in those mailboxes.  I get the usual "we have
now shipped your product" email as well as an electronic receipt, but
NOTHING else -- at least, from these particular merchants.  Kudos to
them!

(Also, no addressed postal spam either -- since moving into my current
residence in 1998 I've been EXTREMELY careful about giving this out,
and I just don't get ANY).

Companies to Demonstrate the Value of 3G Secure Mobile Data Services for
                         Enterprise Customers

    BONN, Germany, Jan. 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Lucent
Technologies (NYSE:LU) and T-Mobile today launched a joint pilot
project to evaluate secure high-speed data services using
third-generation (3G) Universal Mobile Telecommunications System
(UMTS) technology.  The pilot, which will involve enterprises in the
Nuremberg region, will demonstrate how business customers can benefit
from secure, high-speed data mobile services and integrated end-
to-end enterprise applications.  This pilot network will leverage
experience and expertise gained from the development of the Lucent
UMTS network at its facility in Nuremberg.  

Under the agreement, Lucent will supply T-Mobile with its Secure
Mobile Data Solutions for Enterprises (SMDSe) offer, a pre-integrated
package of hardware and software designed to enable business customers
to use their laptop PCs or PDAs to access -- from any location -- all
the applications they normally use with the same level of security and
performance they typically experience in their office.  A key
component of this end-to-end solution is the 3GlobeTrotter(TM) UMTS
wireless modem PCMCIA card -- jointly developed by Lucent and Option
 -- which supports high-speed data connections on laptops, PDAs and
other mobile devices.

Late last year, Lucent and Option completed the first data calls using
the 3GlobeTrotter cards at Lucent's labs in Nuremberg, where
substantial development work on the cards has been done.  Lucent's
SMDSe offer also incorporates software tools that enable an enterprise
user to quickly and easily activate high-speed mobile data services,
and solutions to support seamless roaming from the 3G UMTS network to
wireless local area networks.

     SunnComm Announces Use of Microsoft's Windows Media Data Session
     Toolkit with MediaMax CD-3 To Create 'Second Session' for
     Upcoming Ike & Tina Turner Historic Compilation CD
     - Jan 20, 2003 03:39 AM (BusinessWire)

PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 20, 2003--SunnComm Technologies,
Inc. (OTC:STEH) announced today that its MediaMax(TM) CD-3(TM)
technology has been incorporated to enhance and protect the content
within Ike and Tina Turner's newly discovered historic compilation CD
entitled "The Early Sessions." The content incorporated on the CD's
original tracks (called the "Redbook" session), will be released by
Sterling Entertainment, a division of UAV, and protected by SunnComm.

    The audio CD will also feature a secure multimedia experience
referred to as a "second session" for playback on the PC. This "second
session" is built using the Microsoft Windows Media Data Session
Toolkit, a new component of Windows Media 9 Series that enables media
companies to securely create and deliver secure high-quality content
via a "second session" in various formats including CDs and DVDs for
playback on the PC. The toolkit gives media and entertainment

The album, "The Early Sessions" is scheduled to be released to the
public in March 2003 by Sterling Entertainment, a division of UAV and
will utilize SunnComm's MediaMax technology under a licensing deal
that will generate a per-unit royalty payment to SunnComm. The
addition of SunnComm and Microsoft technologies on the album's "second
session" allows buyers of the CD to make licensed copies of the music
on their PC for their own personal use. Additionally, using SunnComm's
PromoPlay(TM) functionality, consumers can send selected music tracks
to their friends to enjoy for a limited number of plays or a limited
number of days of play.  Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) will include a
demo of this solution built using the Windows Media Data Session
Toolkit while at the Midem conference in Cannes, France. Midem is
indisputably the world's leading international music market
conference. Midem is online at http://www.midem.com.

http://www.planetreplay.com/sharing_011603.php

Sharing currently suspended

I gave my deposition testimony in the Entertainment Companies' lawsuit
against SonicBLUE on January 14th. Based on the questions they asked
me at my deposition, the fact that I do not want my users to be sued
or their privacy put at risk, and that I myself do not want to be
sued, the portions of PlanetReplay.com relating to sharing shows have
been taken down until further notice.

As many of you may know if you have been reading this web site over
the past few months, I was subpoenaed to give documents and a
deposition in the lawsuit between the Entertainment Companies and
SonicBLUE. That deposition happened on January 14th, 2003. Based on
the questions I was asked by the lawyer for the Entertainment
Companies, it became clear to me that the Plaintiffs consider my web
site, Planet Replay, to be aiding in the violation of their
copyrights. More importantly to me, it seems that the Plaintiffs were
also interested in the users of this site and the data about show
sharing that this site provides.

I think it is also obvious to anyone paying attention to current
events that the Plaintiffs have little reluctance to sue anyone who
they consider to be violating their copyrights or helping others to
violate their copyrights (such as SonicBLUE, KaZaa, Napster,
etc. etc.) On the advice of my lawyer, I have taken down the sharing
side of the Planet Replay web site and one of the forums.

Given that I do not want to put the privacy of Planet Replay users at
risk, and that I myself do not want to be sued, I made the hard
decision that it is in the best interests of the users of this site,
as well as my own, that the sharing portions of this web site be taken
down. Hopefully, if the lawsuit against SonicBLUE goes to trial and
the court supports the legality of show sharing, the site will return.

The rest of Planet Replay, the FAQs, Forums, and Account Management
area (including account removal) will still remain active during these
times.

Thank you all for your support and your interest.

If you have any questions about why I have taken down the site, please
send an email to press@planetreplay.com and either I or my lawyer will
get back to you.

Subject: Can XM Put Radio Back Together Again?



Heard avril Lavigne's 'Complicated' just a wee bit too often? You can
thank Lee Abrams, the man who shackled FM radio to the tyranny of mass
market research. The 'Moses of programming,' they call him.

By Frank Ahrens

Sunday, January 19, 2003; Page W12

Why does radio sound the way it does today? Why does it sound like
it's been prepped, packaged and served up in easy-to-digest bites,
like tiny bits of Spam stuck on toothpicks?

We're talking about music radio, so we're talking about FM. Staticky 
AM remains the province of news, sports, talk and such utility-style 
information. Silken FM, as it has been for the past 35 years, is the 
home of music, thanks to its static-free stereo sound.

Owing to a growing sophistication in audience research, light-speed
consolidation of radio ownership and the attendant rise in value of FM
stations, the commercial FM dial has been essentially reduced to six
musical formats: Pop/rock, hip-hop, country, classical,
Spanish-language and variations on the theme of "adult contemporary,"
a sort of light pop or R&B. Research has shown radio owners that these
are the moneymaking formats, and this is where they've flocked.  Swept
off the dial are niche formats, such as blues, bluegrass, easy
listening and jazz, except for Kenny G-style "lite jazz," which falls
neatly in the adult contemporary category.

Today's broadcasters will publicly tout what they call the diversity
of the radio dial, but they know better. "It's not like the old days,"
they lament, though never in public.

I wouldn't force the full install.  That's actually advised against in
the online documents.  The cygwin download is not small, but I use it
every day on Windows ME, NT, 2k, and XP.  I never use "cmd" or
"command".  I am in a bash shell if I need to do command line stuff,
even on remotely mapped systems "cd '\\othersystem\c\foo\file'".

Wonderful stuff for someone accustomed to unix utilities.  Do the
default download, using rcn.net as the mirror site.  Then go back and
expand each group, to see what you might have missed.  Tail might be
in the default set, or the "text utilities" set.

I use the free XWin as an xterminal to Unix boxes in the lab.

It's not an emulator.  These are Windows-compiled binaries.

It had to happen sooner or later.

On last week's episode of "John Doe" a murder suspect communicates

replies, "127.21.01.43".  John says, "Hmmm ... local web sex site."

To me, the Digest is most importantly a first-person link to all the

person, but are clippings of the writings of others from major news
media.  Including reprints as a major portion of the Digest,
regardless of their brevity or applicability, seriously diminishes the
value of the first person participation that distinguishes the Digest,

Not to defend SBC, even though I retired from there, but I've actually
had very good service on the DSL side. I just spent 2 hours on the
phone with them after my wife f**ked up her DSL install and they were
pleasant the entire time. I'm in St. Louis BTW. I prefer to think that
an old retired fart gets no better service that the general public,
but who's to say.

I've had worse luck on the SDSL circuit which is from AccessUS through
IP Communications through SBC (for the copper). Lots of
finger-pointing there. It take about a week to get bad outside plant
fixed.

The Radio Shack stores in the U.K. go by the name of Tandy, but the

This article, and the general copy protection for DVD/CD discussions,
put me in mind of the old Locksmith program for the Apple ][ and //e
computers.  This was a great program for copying disks that could not

like everyone playing with Apple computers those days had a copy of
Locksmith, and the was always a mad rush when a new version came out.

Not all DSLs are created equally, apparently.

I have five DSL lines here.  None of these lines have those
at-the-jack inline filters, although my ISP now offers it as the
default option.  You can (now at extra cost) get a POTS splitter
installed near your demarc, which accomplishes the same thing.  In
actual fact, the system will work without either the inline filters or
the POTS splitter, but your DSL performance can suffer when you're
using the line for other things (and particularly when hanging up,
picking up the line, etc.)

While I understand that this PPPoE thing may not be uncommon south of
the 49th, most ISP's here (and I suspect many in the US) don't use it.
With my ISP, "consumer" grade DSL is set up as if the client machine
is simply part of the ISP's ethernet.  ISP provides a DHCP server, and
client is assigned an IP on the fly.  My lines are commercial and thus
I have static IP's - I just tell each ethernet adapter what it's IP
is, and I'm good to go - NO other configuration, NO spyware, NO PPPoE.

Anyone using the above as criteria in choosing between DSL and cable
should be aware of these differences, and should investigate these
things with their prospective ISP's before signing up.

Actually cable modem service also depends on the topology of how the
vendor provisions it's segments.  Cable is a "shared media" transport
whereas DSL is not.  Sharing of the bandwidth on cable is fine as long
as there aren't too many other active subscribers hogging it.  The
DOCSIS standards still don't provide for individual dynamic bandwidth
mediation (AFAIK?) and thus your neighbor who is uploading (narrowest
bandwidth) his or her entire electronic photo collection is going
bring cable modem transport for other users to a grinding halt.  It
can also occur in the downstream side, but there it is generally less
of a problem due to a much larger spectrum allocation.  See for
yourself if your cable modem has an "activity LED" on it.  It is quite
similar to the NIC active LEDs in that it indicates packets moving
somewhere on the segment that you are attached to.

11-digit dialing is coming to NYC on February 1, 2003.  NYC had
managed to hang onto 7 digit dialing even with its overlays for a few
years, thanks to the NYS PSC who fought the FCC and lost over this
issue.

Besides the general stupidity of having to dial an area code when
calling within the same area code, this new scheme makes even less
sense, since dialing a 1 will now be required for *all* calls, except
things like 911, 411, and 0.  What's the point of making everyone who
calls anywhere dial a 1?  How long until they sell phones that dial a
1 as soon as you pick up the receiver?

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: That dialing '1' in front of everything
is a dumb move. I hope they will fix it at least so that a person who
without thinking dials '1911' won't be forced to hang up and dial
again.  PAT]

It's true to say that most mobile contract subscriptions include bundles
of 'free' text messages, so the cost of texting is often very low.
However the 'texting generation'- generally children/youths under 18 are
too young to get contracts and mainly use prepay. Typical texting
behaviour is exchanges of multiple messages - each one costing around 10
pence. Voice call costs vary, but you could generally make a one minute
mobile-mobile voice call carrying the same (or more) information for
less than the cost of a typical text exchange.

Don't forget that there are also two new standards, CDMA and GSM- I'm
sure this doesn't help much either, even if you have a dual mode

To be fair, one of the main reasons for the premium is the termination
cost charged by the mobile operators. This is about to take a beating
from the UK telecoms regulator OFTEL..which won't help my annual bonus
one little bit, let me tell you. :+((

Not sure what you man by service in this context, here in the UK
mobile nets certainly offer more fautures, and you don't usually have
to pay extra for them; for example my mobiel subscripion has
incluisive voicemail, call waiting and CLID which would all attract an
additional charge if I wanted them on my PSTN line.

Same here in the UK. Call minutes are a commodity product now, and
priced as such.

Fair point, but is number portability really that important in the US
market? We've had mobile number portability in the UK for some time now
and takeup hasn't really been all that high compared to inter-operator
churn.

Possibly. Don't forget that Scandanavia is also home to two of the

See my point on OFTELs investigation of mobile termination costs above.
You can probably always use a low cost calling card operator though.

And typical of any mobile net anywhere in the world trying to pick up
customers . Handset subsidies are a serious drain on mobile operators'
profits, but sadly traditionally considered a necessary evil to
attract contract customers- hence the contract period tie in which is
required to recoup the handset cost. The factory gate price of your
3360 probably approaches $150-$200.

In the end I don't think there's a 'winning' solution- both methods of
charging have their advantages and disavantages, and advocates of
either method are influenced to a large degree by what you're used
to. The one thing you can be certain of is that there is serious
downward pressure on call costs - both regulatory and market driven.

Megan E. Mulligan, 01.21.03, Forbes.com 

NEW YORK - The Vertu phone was never intended for technophiles. It's
big, it's heavy, there's no Palm software available that can turn it
into a handheld computer. But the company, an offshoot of mass
mobile-phone marketer Nokia, has chosen a contrarian design approach
that is filling a particular niche -- occupied by those who tote Hermes
towels to the beach and think nothing of jetting to a second home in
Paris or the Caribbean for the weekend.

Ranging in price from $4,900 to $19,450, Vertu's mobile phones are
made of precious materials -- from the extremely durable sapphire
crystal faceplate, grown at the company's own castle in Switzerland
(only a diamond is harder) to the stainless steel, gold or platinum
detailing. Several new designs have been released recently -- one of
brushed gold (ironically meant to be less flashy than the polished
gold) and another with a mirrored finish on the face.

Each phone contains 450 parts rather than the 50 used in most
conventional phones, and Swiss watchmakers spend three weeks
handcrafting them in a factory outside London. Twenty new patents were
developed in the course of product development.

Not the mention the fact that all "YYY" combination (all three digits
the same) are reserved for some unspecified future use.  Or, as our
friends at <www.areacode-info.com> put it, YYY combos are "Unassigned
easy-to-recognize."  For that matter, so are all NYY combinations.

Apparently you can't get a YYY area code even if you ask for it. 
According to a story here on TD several years ago, Nevada couldn't get
777, so they had to settle for 775.  Sorta like getting two cherries and
a lemon.

And this raises a question I've been wondering about: what *is* that
"unspecified future use"?  Anybody know?

Speaking of area codes, I should note that the 801/385 split (Utah) has
been postponed again.  The latest target date is 2005.

The local high school students are probably disappointed by this delay. 
They've already figured out what 385 spells, and (at least according to
rumor) some of them are anxious to start using it.

But in the meantime, they seem to be amusing themselves by renaming our
locally-famous mountain, Ben Lomond Peak.  It's now known as Bin Laden
Peak.

Subject: Two From Europe Make Brazil Phone Deal


By TONY SMITH

SAO PAULO, Brazil, Jan. 16 - Two major European phone companies,
Telefonica of Spain and Portugal Telecom, said today that they would
acquire the Brazilian mobile phone operator Tele Centro Oeste Celular
Participales for just over $1 billion, raising their share in one of
the world's fastest-growing wireless markets above 50 percent.

The companies said their existing Brazilian joint venture, Telesp
Celular Participaes, would pay 1.4 billion Brazilian reais ($425
million) to Grupo Splice, the main shareholder in Tele Centro Oeste,
for its 61 percent voting stake, and then later offer 2 billion reais
($580 million) to minority and nonvoting shareholders for the
remainder.

Together, Telesp and Tele Centro Oeste would have 16.8 million
subscribers, more than three times those of the next biggest carrier
in Brazil, Telecom Italia Mobile.

The deal would also fill in nearly all the gaps in Telesp's service
map, leaving only one state in the north, Minas Gerais, where it must
depend on a roaming agreement with a local carrier, Vsper.

Subject: DMCA: Ma Bell Would Be Proud


By Lauren Weinstein (a commentary)
02:00 AM Jan. 20, 2003 PT

Get out your wallet. Big business has found another way to tighten the
screws on customers, in league with its new partner: the notorious
Digital Millennium Copyright Act.

Just as naysayers predicted when it was enacted, the DMCA's
anticompetitive impact is reverberating widely beyond the
entertainment and software industries, with potentially devastating
effects on consumers.

Businesses have always tried to try control their customers and
prevent competition. The saga of Ma Bell -- AT&T's old Bell System --
is a case in point.

Not so many decades ago, you couldn't buy or legitimately connect your
own phone or other telecom equipment to the public telephone network
in the United States, except in some cases if you were the government
or a newspaper wire service. Virtually everything related to telephone
communications had to be leased from the local monopoly phone company,
which also performed all installations and maintenance.

Subject: Article | Telecom Undone - a Cautionary Tale


January 2003
By Peter Huber

The demise of the telecommunications industry can be traced to a
single source-the FCC's own implementation of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996. Huber examines how utopianism and meddlesome arrogance on
the part of the government have resulted in the near-total collapse of
the telecommunications industry.

Subject: Johansen Verdict Appealed by Norwegian Prosecutors


http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/DeCSS_prosecutions/Johansen_DeCSS_case/20030120_eff_pr.php


Electronic Frontier Foundation Defends Viewing Own DVDs
Electronic Frontier Foundation Media Advisory

Oslo, Norway - Norwegian government prosecutors today submitted an
appeal of the case against Jon Johansen, a teenager who again faces
criminal charges for helping to write and publish a DVD descrambling
program. Johansen used the program called DeCSS to watch his own DVDs
on his Linux computer.

Johansen's attorney Halvor Manshaus, of the lawfirm Schjdt AS, 
provided the following statement:

"It is correct that the prosecution has decided to appeal the court
ruling in this case. This is not unexpected, as the prosecution has
flagged this as a case of principle interest. The appeals court,
Borgarting lagmannsrett, may decide not to grant the appeal, as there
is a screening principle for criminal cases. If the appeal is granted,
this means that there will be full proceedings before the appeal court
on all aspects of the case, i.e. both factual evidence and legal
arguments. I am positive with regard to the final outcome of the
case."

"The lower court ruled unanimously that Johansen did not violate 
Norwegian law," said Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) Executive 
Director Shari Steele. "Johansen did not violate any copyrights and 
Norway doesn't have a Digital Millennium Copyright Act that could 
prevent DVD owners from viewing their own DVDs on their own computers 
as we have here in the United States."

NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - EchoStar Communications Corp.
(NASDAQ:DISH) is in talks to sell itself to Rupert Murdoch or
Liberty Media Corp. (NYSE:L), the Wall Street Journal reported on
Tuesday.

    Citing industry officials familiar with the contacts, the
newspaper said EchoStar Chairman Charles Ergen, recently
blocked by federal regulators from acquiring Hughes Electronics
Corp. (NYSE:GMH) and its DirecTV satellite unit, has been talking
with Murdoch's News Corp. (AUS:NCP) and Liberty Media but there
have not been any formal negotiations.

Subject: Verizon Must Reveal Internet Song-Swapper - judge


    WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Recording companies won a
victory in their fight against online piracy on Tuesday, when a
U.S. court ordered Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) to turn over
the name of a customer suspected of downloading more than 600
songs in one day over the Internet.

    The decision could set an important precedent as the
recording industry asks schools, businesses and Internet
providers to help them track down the online song swappers that
they believe are cutting into their sales.

    Under a 1998 digital-copyright law, Internet providers have
voluntarily shut down Web sites that contain infringing
material, but they have balked at requests to disconnect users
who trade songs with each other directly using "peer to peer"
networks such as Kazaa and Morpheus.

   RIAA wins battle to ID Kazaa user
   By Declan McCullagh
   January 21, 2003, 12:02 PM PT

   A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Verizon Communications to disclose
   the identity of an alleged peer-to-peer pirate in a legal decision
   that could make it easier for the music industry to crack down on
   file-swapping networks.
   
   In a 37-page decision, U.S. District Judge John Bates said the wording
   of the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act requires Verizon to give
   the Recording Industry Association of America the name of a Kazaa
   subscriber who allegedly was sharing more than 600 music recordings.
   Bates said "the court disagrees with Verizon's strained reading of the
   act, which disregards entirely the clear definitional language."

Subject: How to Destroy Data, From Software to Sledgehammer


By Hiawatha Bray, Globe Staff, 1/20/2003

Last Thursday, the Globe wrote about two grad students at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology who discovered personal data on
discarded computer hard drives. The users had neglected to completely
delete their data before selling or giving away their old machines.
And the Globe neglected to tell you how to avoid the same mistake.

The result was an e-mailbox full of good questions, and an excellent 
excuse for a column.

Subject: Lucent Technologies Reports Results for First Quarter of Fiscal


     *  Financial results in line with guidance
     *  Revenues of $2.08 billion for the quarter and loss per share of 11
        cents
     *  Expects second quarter revenues to increase to about $2.5 billion
     *  Reaffirms return to profitability in fiscal 2003
     *  Repurchased more than $1 billion of convertible securities to date

    MURRAY HILL, N.J., Jan. 22 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Lucent
Technologies (NYSE:LU) today reported results for the first quarter of
fiscal 2003, which ended Dec. 31, 2002, in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  The company
recorded revenues of $2.08 billion in the quarter, which represented a
9 percent sequential decline from the $2.28 billion in revenues
achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002.  The company had
previously stated that revenues for the quarter would be flat to down
10 percent on a sequential basis.  The company recorded $3.58 billion
in revenues in the year-ago quarter.

    The company's net loss for the quarter was $264 million or 11
cents per share(1).  These results compare with a loss of $2.81
billion or 84 cents per share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 and
a loss of $423 million or 14 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.

    The first quarter's loss per share included the favorable impact
of 5 cents per share(2) due to the reduction of reserves for a legal
settlement associated with Lucent's former consumer products leasing
business and certain business restructuring actions, as well as
customer financing recoveries.  These favorable items were partially
offset by a negative impact of 1 cent per share(2) from the repurchase
of convertible securities, including the resulting tax benefits.
These items resulted in a net favorable impact of 4 cents per share in
the first quarter.  

By comparison, the loss per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal
2002 was negatively impacted by charges of 59 cents per share(2),
primarily due to business restructuring charges, a significant
customer financing default and other asset impairment charges.  The
loss per share for the year-ago quarter was favorably impacted by 13
cents per share(2), primarily due to gains related to the sale of the
optical fiber business and certain other investments and the reversal
of certain business restructuring charges.  In addition, results for
the year-ago quarter included significant tax benefits, which are not
currently recognized due to the full valuation allowance on the
company's net deferred tax assets.

    BEDMINSTER, N.J., Jan. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- AT&T (NYSE:T)
today announced its fourth-quarter and full-year 2002 results.  The
company's fourth-quarter earnings per diluted share, which reflect a
gain in discontinued operations from the disposition of AT&T
Broadband, partially offset by a loss from continuing operations
resulting from restructuring and asset impairment charges announced
earlier this month, was $0.66.

    The company reported a loss from continuing operations, primarily
resulting from an asset impairment charge associated with the
company's past investment in AT&T Latin America (ALA), and also
reflecting the impact of a restructuring charge associated with
planned employee separations and an asset impairment charge related to
the value of the company's DSL assets. The loss per diluted share from
continuing operations was $0.79.  Revenue for the quarter was $9.3
billion, a decline of 8.6 percent from the year-ago quarter.  The
company attributes the revenue decline to continued declines in long
distance voice services, partially offset by growth in local voice as
well as data/Internet protocol (IP) and managed services.

Subject: Master-Keyed Lock Vulnerability


http://www.crypto.com/masterkey.html

Matt Blaze
AT&T Labs -- Research

The threat

In a recent research paper, we describe weaknesses in most
master-keyed lock systems, such as those used by offices, schools, and
businesses as well as by some residential facilities (particularly
apartment complexes, dormitories, and condominiums).  These weaknesses
allow anyone with access to the key to a single lock to create easily
the "master" key that opens every lock in the entire system. Creating
such a key requires no special skill, leaves behind no evidence, and
does not require engaging in recognizably suspicious behavior. The
only materials required are a metal file and a small number of blank
keys, which are often easy to obtain.

Needless to say, the ability for any keyholder to obtain system-wide
access represents a serious potential threat to the security of
master-keyed installations. Individuals and institutions that depend
on such locks to protect their safety and property should be aware of
these risks and consider alternatives to eliminate or reduce their
exposure to this threat.

The vulnerability was discovered by applying the techniques of 
cryptanalysis, ordinarily used to break secret codes, to the analysis 
of mechanical lock design. The research paper describing this 
analysis and the discovered vulnerability can be found (in PDF 
format) on the world wide web at http://www.crypto.com/papers/mk.pdf. 
(Note -- this file is rather large, about 4MB and is not suitable for 
download over dialup or slow connections). A version of the paper has 
been submitted to the IEEE journal "Security and Privacy."

Subject: Illegal Snooping Costs Allstate Access to Pnline DMV Records
Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2003 14:05:30 -0500


By Deborah Lohse
Mercury News

California's Department of Motor Vehicles has banned Allstate
Insurance from checking driver records online after Allstate employees
were caught illegally snooping through records of friends, family and
others.

In one case, an Allstate employee released a confidential home address
that enabled an unidentified road-rage driver to send a written threat
to another driver.

After that incident, the threatened driver complained to DMV, which
investigated.  It did not learn the identity of the Allstate employee
who facilitated the threat, but DMV did find 131 violations of
confidentiality rules such as those requiring people who access the
data to have individual passwords and sign confidentiality papers.

Allstate employees in seven claims offices violated the rules,
sometimes by sharing computer passwords on Post-it notes, in other
cases by making up fake car-claim numbers to get into friends' or
family members' DMV records, officials said.

million in the fourth quarter of 2002.  In the fourth quarter of 2001,
Motorola reported special items resulting in a net charge of $1.7

Subject: Last Laugh! ***SPAM*** I Made $60,000 in Two Months!!!
Date: Thu, 23 Jan 2003 00:09:45 -0100


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: It seems to be not enough that we each
get tons of spam every day; now there is a netizen who wishes to sell
us material on how to create new, additional spam. I thought this
thing which I found in my spam bucket yesterday was really very 
interesting.    PAT]

Hi:

I'm a college dropout.  I work about two hours a day.  I'm ambitious,
but extremely lazy, and I make over $30,000 a month.  Are you curious
yet?

In a minute I'm going to tell you my secret, it's the dirty little
secret of the Internet ...

You've probably heard stories about people making whopping huge money
online, but you thought they were the big corporate execs, famous
programmers, or boy-geniuses.

Well, grasshopper, think again ...

It's people like you and me that are making the real money.  Yep,
people like YOU AND ME!

Ever since the "dot com bubble" burst in 1999, small-time
entrepreneurs are getting richer while the Fortune 500 companies look
for bankruptcy lawyers.

Today small business owners and ordinary folks like you and me can use
the web to achieve complete financial freedom with NO INVESTMENT and
very little work.  How?  By learning the most profitable marketing
technique ever created - it's called bulk email, or SPAM.

If you've ever recieved an email advertisement, then you know what
bulk email is.  I bet you can't click on DELETE fast enough for most
of those ads, right?  You might not want their product, but remember
that thousands of other folks probably do.  Bulk email is a percentage
game - every bulk emailer who contacts you makes a six figure income
on the Internet.  I guarantee it.  Now let's go back to Math 101 and
review some numbers ...

If you sell on eBay, you pay anywhere from a few dollars to over a
hundred dollars just to post one auction.  How many people see your
ad?  Maybe a couple thousand or even ten or twenty thousand over a
period of days.  Using bulk email, YOU CAN SEND YOUR AD TO MORE THAN A
MILLION PEOPLE A DAY at virtually no cost.  Whether your send 100,000
emails or 100 million emails, the price is the same.  ZERO!

Stop paying those outrageous auction listing fees when hardly anyone
sees your ad!

Imagine that you have a decent product with a profit margin of $20.00
on each sale.  If you send an email ad to 500,000 people, and only one
person in a thousand actually places an order, then you just generated
500 orders and made $10,000 in a few hours of work.

It's that simple ...

All you have to do is convince ONE PERSON OUT OF A THOUSAND to buy
your stuff and you're FILTHY RICH.

The best thing is that anyone can do it.  Doesn't matter if you're a
nineteen-year-old college student using a dorm-room computer or a
fifty-year-old executive working from an office building in New York
City.  Anyone, and I repeat ANYONE, can start bulk emailing with
virtually no startup costs.  All it takes is a few days of study,
plenty of ambition, and some basic familiarity with the Internet.

I quit college when I was 19 to capitalize on the "Dot Com" mania, and
I've never looked back.  I started with no money, no product to sell,
and only the most rudimentary computer skills.  I saw an opportunity
and I seized it.  A few years later, I bought my own home - with CASH.

You don't need any money.  You don't need a product.  You don't
need to be a computer nerd and no experience whatsoever is required.

If you saw an employment ad in the newspaper like that you'd jump
right on it.  It would be a dream come true.  So what are you waiting
for?! 

I'm going to ask you four simple questions.  If you answer
YES to all of them, then I can almost promise that you will make at
least $100,000 using bulk email this year.  <p> Here goes ...  <p> Do
you have basic experience with the web?  Do you have a computer and an
Internet connection?  Do you have a few hours each day of free time?
Do you want to earn some extra money with an eye towards complete
financial freedom?  

If you answer YES to these questions, you could be making $5,000 -
$20,000 per week working from your home.  Kiss your day job goodbye -
this sure beats the 9-5 daily grind!  <p> All you need is ambition and
commitment.  This is no "get rich quick scheme".  You have to work to
make big bucks, but ANYONE - and I mean ANYONE - can do it.

You're probably wondering if it's hard to get
started.  Don't worry, it's not! I will show you step-by-step how to
start your first email campaign and how to build a booming online
business.  You'll be generating orders - AND MAKING MONEY - in less
than seven days.  

Okay, so what if you don't have anything to sell?

No problem!!  I'll show you where to find hot products that sell like
CRAAAAAAZY! Most people delay starting an Internet business because
they have nothing to sell, but I'm removing that hurdle right now.
After reading the Spambook, you can build your complete product line
in less than two hours!  There is NO EXCUSE not to get started! I will
get you up-and-running within seven days. In fact ...

I personally guarantee that you will start your own bulk email
campaign less than a week after reading the Spambook!  I'll give you a
toll-free phone number to reach me 24 hours a day, seven days a week;
where else will you find that level of service?!

I will also include a step-by-step guide to starting your very first
email campaign called "Seven Days to Bulk Email Success".  This
seperate guide contains a daily routine for you to follow with
specific, exact instructions on how to get started.  On day one, for
example, I teach you where to find a product to sell.  The next day
you learn how to build a fresh mailing list.  On the seventh day, you
just click send!  Your very first campaign is ready to go.

As a special bonus, you'll recieve a FREE copy of our STEALTH MASS
MAILER, a very powerful bulk email program which retails for $49.99!
I'll even include 7 million email addresses absolutely FREE if you
order NOW!  <p> Stop wasting your money on auction listing fees,
classifieds, and banner ads - they don't work, and never will!  If you
are SERIOUS about making money on the Internet, bulk email is your
only option.  What are you waiting for?  Few of us are willing to
share this knowledge, but I promise to teach you everything I know

I can understand why the area code has to be dialed, but why is Verizon
(or the NY PUC?) mandating the 1+ too?   Verizon has already implemented
10 digit dialing up and down its territory, as have many other places
too.  In these areas, Verizon has repeated over and over that the 1+ is
not necessary, and to just dial 10 digits, not 11.

But in New York City, 11 (1+ 10digits) apparently will be mandated.  I
suspect it is the PUC that is requiring this strangeness, but who knows.
Verizon obviously has the technology to do just 10 digits.  It would make
a lot more sense to keep things consistent across the land where the area
code must be used for all calls.

It's a revenue enhancer. Used to be that 1 was the toll indicator , now 
people will just blindly dial away and get hit with the toll when the 
bill comes in. 

Typical predatory tactics.

I can see why you would have to dial the local area code (after all,
how would the switch know WHICH local area code in the overlay that
you meant?), but the dialing of the '1' seems superfluous.

Back in the really old days (fifties), not only was a '1' not
necessary for dialing long distance here, but a '1' as an initial
digit would not even break dial tone. Somewhere in the eighties, the
'1' became optional. You could dial it (it would break dial tone then)
or not; your call would complete just fine regardless. Then finally,
in the mid-nineties when the informal prefixes finally came to 408,
the '1' became mandatory to differentiate between a seven or ten-digit
number.

Any area that uses ten-digit dialing should make the '1' optional.

To prevent misdialing by people who are trying to dial seven digit
numbers.  I suspect after training the customers for a year or two,
they'll start letting you dial without the 1.

Subject: Calling Party Pays to Cellular


In December 2001, the FCC lifted its ban on technology-specific area
codes. 

However, the FCC's policy change does not automatically assure
approval of a request for such an area code. It requires state
regulatory agencies to request such area codes on an individual basis,
and each will be approved/disapproved based on the merits of the
request.

TWO INDICTED IN NIGERIAN BUSINESS SCAM

Westchester County District Attorney Jeanine Pirro and Ardsley Police
Chief Emil Califano announced the indictment of Chuks Nwogu (DOB
9/12/70) of 63 West 7th Street, Mt. Vernon, New York and his wife,
Svitlana Nwogu (DOB 2/18/77) of 3039 Kingsland Ave. Bronx, New York
for Grand Larceny in the Second and Third Degree. It is alleged that
over the course of the past year, the two defendants and others
solicited more than $200,000 in cash payments from a Wisconsin
businessman on the pretext that the money would be used to ship
$50,000,000 into the United States from Nigeria, at which time the
victim would receive one third of the money.

And it's one using common sense consumer protection
truth-in-advertising laws rather than brand new stuff. lots of good
points here which would apply to many other spammers.

http://www.oag.state.ny.us/press/2003/jan/jan22c_03.html

Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Lottie E. Wilkins permanently enjoined
MonsterHut, Inc., its Chief Executive Officer Todd Pelow, and its
Chief Technical Officer Gary Hartl, from "further engaging in any of
the fraudulent, deceptive and illegal acts and practices pertaining to
representations of 'opt-in', 'opt-out' or the 'permission-based'
nature of their protocols or the collection and use of their email
data."

A central issue in the dispute was the Attorney General's contention 
which the court endorsed  that Monsterhut and its principals had violated
New York's consumer fraud laws by falsely representing that the company
had obtained consumers' "permission" to send emails, or that consumers had
"opted in" to receive them. The court held that the term "opt-in" (like
the term "opt-out") has a clearly defined meaning within the industry,
regulators and that Monsterhut's practice did not qualify as "opt-in"
under the accepted definition of that term.

No one told me, I clicked on the link expecting to find an interesting
article (about some porn scandal and maybe even a review of protection
software), followed the links, and ended up on a page that tried to
sell me some software that clears out caches and run histories (and
other stuff) for over $100 for a single user license. And if you don't
buy the product, you get multiple large pop-up browser windows asking
why you didn't buy ...

It's spam for "Evidence Eliminator".

See <http://groups.google.com/groups?q=+%22Evidence+Eliminator%22+group:news.admin.net-abuse.sightings&scoring=d>
for a WHOLE BUNCH of collected spam (going back more than two years) 
for Evidence Eliminator.

SBC Internet Services did OK for me in the year that I had them for DSL.
The telco division of SBC is the fine group of people that screwed up 
my DSL line by placing a loop between me and the CO that never should
have been there, and sat on the problem for two months.

AccessUS, from my limited experience, is a shambles. From what I've 
seen, I can't believe they're still around.

I just installed another SBC ADSL connection today. SLA=128/384. Actual, 
about 110/150-170. We'll see how it goes.

When I called them, they fed me a line about leaving the DSL modem on
for ten days for "optimization". Anyone know what SBC does during the
ten day "optimization" period? Firmware upgrade?

Starband would be able to do the Satellite Internet/TV.

If you're in an area that Vonage serves you can use them for phone
over your broadband Internet connection. I'm considering trying them
myself.

There are other issues, too, even for calls other than from prisons.

I think that when I am paying for a long-distance call, even if as a
collect call, it should be paid to the company *I* have selected as my
long-distance carrier.  I have supposedly had the chance to see their
rates for different kinds of calls.  When the call comes collect and
is being charged by a company unknown to me, I have NO way of knowing
who they are or what their rates are until I get my phone bill.
That's a terrible way to do business!  People should have the right to
know up front what the charges are so they can make an informed
decision about whether to accept the charges or not.

I have NEVER been asked to accept charges on a collect call when I was
*informed* about what company the L/D carrier is or what the rate I am
paying will be.  Most of those collect calls these days are automated
and you can't talk to an operator who can tell me what the per-minute
charges are.

Lately, I have been seeing MANY advertisements for something called
1-800-COLLECT which tells us to "save a buck or two."  Well, if you
call "Momma" using that service, how is she going to know what the
charges will be?  How will you know for sure that you are saving her
"a buck or two" when you use this service?  I suspect a lot of people
will be duped and find out the charges are not really better.

I remember for a while getting a rash of collect calls from some kind
of penal institution.  I could never understand or hear clearly the
name given of the person trying to make the call.  I always just hang
up immediately, thinking they dialed a wrong number.  Yet, when it
happened a lot, I began to think someone was up to no good since I had
no family or friends in such a place.

I personally think the prisons would do better to have an approved
list of numbers a prisoner can call out to.  Family members willing to
be called could register their numbers with the prison as OK for the
prisoner to call.

This might stop some of the problem of them dialing people like us who
have no desire to talk to strangers who are in jail or prison.

That's a great idea!  This would allow the family to budget how much
they want to contribute toward that person's phone calls.  If he uses
up all the money on trivial calls, that's his problem.  The family can
at least say they have paid an amount they can afford and not have to
worry about accepting charges for calls they have no idea what the
rates are.

I'll be interested to hear if this "Save a buck or two" company really
does save people money for collect call charges.  I must say they have
some cute commercials!

But there are 666 exchanges.  At least 714 (Houston, et al) has it.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: But many of the '666 exchanges' are
