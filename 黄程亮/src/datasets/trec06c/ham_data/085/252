Markus,

	Maybe I don't understand your problem, but it seems like there
is a very simple solution.  You just construct a file with as many items
as you like, each containing a different frame timer specifying the ISI,
e.g.,

+001 "stim1"/ %70 / * "stim2"/;
+002 "stim1"/ %71 / * "stim2"/;
+003 "stim1"/ %72 / * "stim2"/;
+004 "stim1"/ %73 / * "stim2"/;
+005 "stim1"/ %74 / * "stim2"/;
+006 "stim1"/ %75 / * "stim2"/;
etc.

When the item file is scrambled, these items will appear in a random
sequence.

	--k.i.f.

Subject: [DMDX] ITI by chance 

Hi,

does anyone know how to create an Item-File with ITI´s/ISI´s by chance?

One Trial consists of two stimuli. They are presented one after another.
I am interested in the RT to the second stimulus. 
The ISI should be between 1000 and 1500 ms by chance. Besides I want to 
vary the ITI within a determined range, too. 

Maby I have overlooked a relevant Keyword / combination of Keywords.
If not, maybe someone has a solution to this, using Excel.

Please help me,
Markus.
