Acquittal in First Criminal Copyright Trial
The Recorder

A federal jury in San Jose, Calif., Tuesday found that a Russian
software company did not commit a crime by issuing code-busting
computer software, serving up a high-profile defeat for U.S. Attorney
Kevin Ryan and other prosecutors who hope to use the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act to charge such actions as a crime. ElcomSoft
was the first defendant to face a criminal trial under the DMCA,
passed in 1998.

Sure -- once you put up or shut up.  I've seen several people here
citing many examples, a lot more than you've cited, so right now it
looks like the "rule" is that the opposite assertion is correct.

Anybody can claim "well, I could name a whole lot more examples", but
until you actually do, the burden of proof by the defense has been
met.  Your case has not been made.  I find the defense "not guilty" by
reason of lazy prosecution.

As for the evidence submitted so far, I think that you're probably
right in that the value of brand names is SOMEWHAT diminished compared
to days gone by (time was, people would stick with a particular brand
name or product come hell or high water, and would drive 30 miles to
get it if their local retailer was out of stock, shunning alternative
products), but the case that "national branding is a farce" simply has
not been made, by you or anyone else here.

I live in a town where the Calgary Flames once proudly played in the
"Calgary Olympic Saddledome", but who found their building renamed
twice in three years, first to "Canadian Airlines Saddledome" and then,
when Canadian Airlines merged with Air Monopo^H^H^H^H^H^HCanada, to
"Pengrowth Saddledome".  Hell, I don't even know what a Pengrowth is,
but I sure as heck know what the Olympics are.  That was a sickening
example of excising something proud and noble for the sake of corporate
branding, but I still say you haven't made your case.

Of course, when names change every year, it's hard for a brand to have as
much significance as a century-old name like Coca Cola.

But what are the companies supposed to do?  They can't predict whether
their name is going to change or not.  Should they just give up on
branding, on the assumption that the name will change a year or two
later?  And what happens if they end up being one of the lucky ones
with a stable name?  They could have been building brand name
recognition all that time, but ended up wasting the opportunity.

Finally, if your name changes, branding seems like an immensely
sensible thing to do.  It's an easy way to get your new name into the
public consciousness, i.e. it's cheap advertising.

Sorry, John.  Most of the examples you've brought up, as I've pointed
out, are you stretching things, many beyond rational thought, to try
to "prove" your assertion.

> There are many more examples than telecom in the world of meaningless
> branding.

I won't say it doesn't happen.  But you say it ALWAYS happens, and that
virtually NO national branding has any meaning.  But I've said it two or
three times, and I'll say it again:  you live in your own little technology
world, which has colored your perception of the REAL world.

And there you go, yet again going to your technology world to try to
prove a point about the entire world at large.  You live in that
little technology world, which operates far, far differently than the
rest of the world.  And the technology world, despite what you seem to
think, is a very, very small piece of the world at large.

It's up to you, John, if you want to think that the technology world
is a perfectly representative microcosm of the entire world.  But
you'd be wrong if you did think that.

I believe there is still a call center downtown. Unless several people
at the call center lied to me, that is. (I'm not discounting that
possibility. :) It seems that SBC's Ohio customers may still be
dialing Cleveland for customer service and repair.

Yes, the mindset is that people once read out "oh two oh two" which
became "oh-one pause two oh two" and the format of 01xyz became
embedded. The publicity for London etc going to 8 digits involved a
lot of arty balloons flying around in a good example of adman showing
off to fellow admen and not to the great public.

1992 onwards. First in 1990 there came premium numbers which were
charged at GB rates, using the 030 code which was used to reach GB but
stuffing the Irish premiums behind 00 to make 03000. No adult content,
a lot of read your palm/Mr Angry/horror-scopes/dial a prayer. Operator
codes 18xx and 15xx followed, freefone was 18-00 + 6D, written in
US-style "1 800" but with a giveaway 6 instead of 7 digits following.
We will never outgrow the worldwide impact of Bell's choice of 800 for
freefone.

Pulse dialing is officially 10 PPS. Pulse duration is variable from 58 
to 67 percent of interval between the starts of successive pulses.

Pulse dialing is rarely used in the US.

According to my copy of Bell System Pub 61100 dated Jan 1983

Speed 8-11 pps
Percent break 58-64%

Should check latest specification, but it is unlikely pulse dialing
specification has changed dramatically over the years. Values are
adjusted depending on values of shunt RC network and on resistance of
dialing contact. Given these specification were drawn up in the days
of mechanical dials selecting the mid point should be fine.

OK, I'm going to have to dig into the wayback machine, having not
turned up any new 900 service in some time. However, in the meantime,
I should point out that it won't be like installing a home
phone. First, the service is delivered on T1s or higher capacity
digital circuits. You will need a switch that can process the
calls. Second, if you order directly from an IXC, you will need to
order some minimum amount of service, although the LECs may offer
service on a few lines and even deliver it on analog pairs. The
downside is that the LEC will only deliver such service in one small
area of the LATA. Third, if you get 900 service from an IXC, you will
need to negotiate some rather complex billing arrangements from the
operating companies in your targeted service area.

If none of this sounds cheap ... that's right!

Well, I've been doing my part of that!  :-) It hasn't stopped, but who
knows how much I may have avoided?  I think it is important that you
use a big red Sharpie or equivalent to scrawl "Take me off your
mailing lists" on it and put x-x-x-x-x-x's in the signature block.
This gives you a valid reason to communicate with them, so they can't
accuse you of abusing their business reply frank.  And hopefully, it
keeps some droid that opens the mail from processing it and sending
you the card.

I have a friend who maintains you can do them a little more damage by
actually accepting their offer, then when you get the credit cards
chop them up.  But I'd prefer not to get another envelope from them.

I'm not in court. There is no potential award here. If you don't see
what goes on around you, fine. If you want to live in a dream world,
fine. If you want to subscribe to the fiction of national brands,
fine.  And by the way, I am refering to the US, not Canada.

Well, that IS the point I was trying to make, so I'm not sure what more 
I need to prove. If national brands "sometimes" mean something, then the 
concept is a farce.

I have a company. It's name has never changed in seventeen years. Am I

I never said that the technology world represented anything. But you

OK. You're shopping for a washer/dryer combination. Do you buy GE or
Whirlpool? That's low tech, and a couple of brand names that have been
household words for decades. Hate to burst your bubble, but both are
produced on the same overseas production line. At least some of them
are. You guess which ones.

Or how about TV sets? RCA or Emerson? Two fine, American brands
 ... produced on the same Taiwanese production line.

Is it sinking in yet?

> Yet another example of a meaningless brand name.

The great irony of this particular example is that the corporate
change unintentionally ended up making the arena name far *more*
meaningful than it was before!

Think about why San Jose became a big enough urban area to have an NHL
team in the first place: Silicon Valley.  And what is the company
commonly considered to be the first great fruit (technological fruit,
not citrus) of Silicon Valley?  Hewlett-Packard, founded in that
famous garage about 60 years ago, and still locally headquartered.

Thus, when HP bought Compaq and redubbed the arena the "HP Pavilion",
it gave it a name directly associated with one of the flagship
companies of the local area, in contrast to the old name which honored
a young company headquartered many hundreds of miles away in Texas.
Normally, companies buy the naming rights of local sports venues
precisely because they are local (e.g., the Fleet Center and Gillette
Stadium in the Boston area).  HP ended up with the same result, but by
a far more circuitous path.  (Well, neither of the Boston examples is
totally direct either.  The Fleet Center was originally saupposed to
be called the "Shawmut Center", after a Boston-based bank, but mergers
before it opened meant that the owning bank became "FleetBoston"
instead.  Gillette Stadium is a slightly different story; while under
construction, it was going to be called "CMGi Field", but then the
dot-com bubble burst and Boston-based Gillette stepped in to buy the
naming rights.)

Now, in my neck of the woods, we do indeed have an NHL arena whose
name has very little local significance.  This year, after finally
resolving disputes among various levels of government and NC State
University, the naming rights for Raleigh's still-newish
"Entertainment and Sports Arena" (home of the NHL's Carolina
Hurricanes as well as of NC State basketball) finally went on the
block.  It is now called the "RBC Center", where the "RBC" stands
ultimately for "Royal Bank of Canada".  That's right, an arena in
North Carolina is named for a Canadian bank!  The actual rationale is
that RBC got into the US banking market a couple of years ago by
purchasing a small NC-based bank called Centura (which is now
rebranded as "RBC Centura").  But maybe the real reason is that RBC
decided "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em", after watching the 'Canes
eliminate both of Canada's flagship hockey teams (Montreal Canadiens
and Toronto Maple Leafs) during last spring's Stanley Cup playoffs! :-)

Used to be the case for Coke in Louisiana and Hawaii.

It's no longer the case in Hawaii, I don't think, since the sugarcane

Dunno about Louisiana.

Today I got my phone bill, and it is now official.  It says to make

"SBC Ameritech(TM) will now be simply SBC "Evolving to better suit

Good-bye "Ameritech"!  I thought that was a Good Name!

I poked around in the name servers for .gov and found at least a dozen
states, plus a few cities and counties in the US, as well as a few
multi-state agencies (PANYNJ, for example).

A few examples:

ohio.gov
alaska.gov
hawaii.gov
tennessee.gov
wa.gov (State of Washington)
or.gov (Oregon)
az.gov (Arizona)
maricopa.gov (Maricopa County, as in Phoenix AZ)
phoenix.gov (the city, too)
sandiego.gov
sanantonio.gov
panynj.gov (Port Authority of New York and New Jersey)
tva.gov (Tennessee Valley Authority)

Note that "va.gov" is the Veterans Administration, not Virginia.

I didn't check to see that all of the above are in actual use.

ISTR that the 911 locating feature is only activated when the user
dials 911 -- if it's not there's a big privacy problem on the left bank
of the pond;+) Seriously though you don't need 911 to datamine
location information -- existing call records are enough for low
resolution /high volume mapping and other methods can be used for
high(er) resolution/low volume tracking.  Having said that, if you're
using a prepaid phone which hasn't been registered in your name 'they'
might be able to track you but 'they' will still need to relate the
phone to a person, which isn't easy (most of the time).

I'm certainly not an expert on this stuff, however the way I

With my long distance service, a call from Miami to Key West costs
10.6 cents/minute, while a call from Miami to Honolulu or Prudhoe Bay
costs 4.9 cents/minute.  What problem do you see here, other than
confusion when the party you think is in Key West keeps mentioning

I suppose that if you were calling one of the overpriced Caribbean
islands it could be an issue, but we've been through that discussion
before, and in any event, I don't know of any dialing plan in the US
that distinguishes among different non-local area codes.

For a lot of places in the US, the problem is in your premise: "When
traffic is light (the majority of time)" just isn't true!  I have
noticed that in Washington DC (which has a LOT of traffic circles)
they have solved the problem by simply adding traffic lights at the
entrances.  Betwen 2:00 and 4:00 am, when the traffic actually does
lighten up, they turn the lights to flashing yellow (caution) and it
functions as a normal roundabout.

Subject: Consumers Finding Ways to Zap Telemarketer Calls


By JOHN SCHWARTZ

In their continuing struggle against telemarketers, consumers are
powerless no more.

Telemarketers who call the home of Tono Kessler in Perkasie, Pa., are
likely to hear this recorded message: "The number you are calling has
Call Intercept, a service that requires callers whose telephone number
does not appear on the Caller ID display to identify themselves before
the call can continue." Few telemarketers take the trouble.

Like a growing number of Americans, Mr. Kessler subscribes to an
automated service from his telephone company that blocks most unwanted
calls. "I would estimate that 98 percent of the calls have stopped,"
he said.

Today, the Federal Trade Commission is expected to announce plans for
a nationwide do-not-call list. Consumers have already signed up by the
millions for the growing number of statewide do-not-call lists in more
than half the states. And they are also turning to gadgets with names
like Telezapper, and to services like Call Intercept (in effect,
paying the phone company to help them cope with a nuisance brought to
them, yes, through the phone company).

At the same time, telemarketers continue to come up with ways to
circumvent those protective measures -- for example, sending a dummy
telephone number with their calls so that services like the one Mr.
Kessler uses will not block the call automatically. "It's an arms
race," said Anne Kraus-Keenan, the manager at Verizon Communications
for the service that Mr. Kessler uses.

According to the Direct Marketing Association, telemarketers make 104
million calls a day to businesses and consumers in the United States.
And although people say they hate the calls, somebody out there is
buying. The industry reported revenue from consumers of $295.3 billion
last year.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Another common technique is to record

Subject: History of SAC 900

Actually, I think that it was AFTER divestiture, sometime in the later
1980's, after there were competitive 900 "service" providers, that the
sleaze aspect began, with "questionable" content and "services"(?)
provided on 900, as well as exhorbitant rates along with revenue
sharing between the LD-carrier/Telcos, provider of the "content", and
NUMEROUS possible "middlemen".

The 900 Special Area Code began in the US and (eastern) Canada (i.e.,
Bell Canada territory), circa 1972/73, STRICTLY as a "choke" area code
for "mass calling" purposes. Those major destination cities throughout
the US and (eastern) Canada had a 900-NNX code (or two/more codes)
assigned for receiving "high-volume" traffic. (The 900 code was
actually "assigned" or "reserved" circa 1969/70, but the
implementation of the "choke" network didn't actually begin until
1972/73)

It was intended for high-volume calling to specific nationally
advertised numbers, such as telethon pledge lines (NOT automated
charging of the pledge, but rather to reach a live person who would
take down the details of how to 'bill' the pledge), or other such
national (in scope) radio/TV call-in numbers.

It could also have possibly intended for nationally utilized
high-volume calls to time/temperature/weather services too.

"Choke" network means that there are only so many trunks to the first
toll switch that actually translates and routes out the dialed
900-NNX-xxxx call. Thus, the toll network only handled a limited
number of attempts to such "high-volume" 900 numbers. The limited
number to trunks to the first toll network switch would "choke off"
various attempts above whatever the threshold was. This way, the toll
network "itself" wouldn't become overloaded with thousands upon
thousands of call attempts, which could have "brought down" the
network, or at least caused busy conditions for "normal" long-haul
traffic being placed at the same time.

1970's-era 900 Calls were billed at REGULARLY TARIFFED "POTS" rates,
the destination 900-NNX code being assigned to a specific geographic
destination ratecenter with published V&H co-ordinates, w/r/t the
V&H/ratecenter of the calling party.

Thus, a call from New Orleans to a 900-NNX code associated with New
York City would have been billed the exact same rate as a call to POTS
NPA 212, for that same time-of-day / day-of-week, and other identical
line-classes.

It was possible for the called party to have their 900 number be made
"free". This was the case in 1977, when (then) President Jimmy Carter
and the CBS Radio Network had a special broadcast of impromptu
"call-ins" to the Carter at the White House. CBS Newsman Walter
Cronkite moderated that 3-hour Saturday afternoon radio broadcast live
from the White House. The call-in number was made to be
"reverse-charged", billed to either the Executive Office, or maybe
billed to the Columbia Broadcasting System, and was also FREE from
payphones on that Saturday afternoon. However, one did first route to
the OPERATOR when calling from a payphone, who then put the call
through at no charge.

That number was 900-242-1611 ; Many people who weren't aware that this
was a TEN-digit number were simply trying to dial just the seven-digit
part, 242-1611, and reaching a working number in whatever area codes
had a valid 242 office code along with assigned -1611 line number.

(I also wonder how many states/provinces had active/assigned
intra-state/province-only 800-242-1611 numbers at that time, because I
would assume that some people tried dialing *800* instead of the
correct AND PROPERLY ADVERTISED *900* code; Of course, the "event" was
on a Saturday afternoon, and many businesses who might happened to
have had an 800-242-1611 intrastate-only toll-free number -- might
have been closed for the weekend; Back in the "old days" of 800 in the
1966-82 timeframe, all sixty-four 800-NN2 office codes were for
in-TRA-state/province ONLY numbers, and all sixty-four codes were
actually *re-usable* state-to-state and province-to-province).

The AT&T Long Lines (Kansas City MO) Distance Dialing Reference Guide
throughoute the 1970's listed 900-242 as being Washington DC as the
locality/ratecenter, along with Washington DC's V&H co-ordinates, the
"Chesapeake & Potomoc Telephone of Washington DC" as the associated
"business office" for 900-242, and '202+' as the Operator's Routing
Code for 900-242; 202 being the POTS area code for DC, and '202+1X1'
being what an originating operator might need to dial to reach Inward
(121) or Directory (131) or Rate/Route (141) in DC.

While there were numerous listed destination cities in the US and
(eastern) Canada with 900-NNX codes which had or were INTENDED to have
customers with high-volume incoming calls/lines, there apparantly
weren't all that many customers within each city. While I was aware of
the assignment of the 900 SAC since the mid-1970's, listed in telco
documentation as "mass calling", it wasn't until the CBS Radio special
live call-in to President Carter in Spring 1977 when I first actually
KNEW of any REAL USE of 900.

By 1980, since there were more #4ESS toll switches in the network
which since 1976 began replacing older #4-A/M Crossbar toll switches
and Crossbar-Tandem switches, and also CCIS (#6) signaling replacing
older inband MF signaling, the use of 900 for "choke" routing became
unnecessary. Regular "POTS" numbering could now be possible for
calling such high-volume numbers, within the toll network, and the now
more advanced (Stored Program Control) toll network with many more
4ESS switches and CCIS signaling was able to handle such traffic, or
at least be able to "choke" it itself, without there having to be
dedicated numbering/codes.

But AT&T didn't just "discontinue" all use of Special Area Code 900.

It was still to be used for "media stimulated" calling or a "Mass
Announcement System", but one where the 900-NXX codes didn't have to
be geographically based.

Instead, one could call into special nationwide "information"
services, jointly produced by AT&T and some private "information"
company. These "information" services would be sports scores, stock
market quotes, news, weather, time/temperature services, etc. but all
available and intended for a full "national" audience.

900 could also be used for "vote tallying" on a "mass calling" basis,
especially with a nationally televised or radio-broadcast "event".

Or, there could be live "listen-in" (only) services, where large
numbers of callers could "dial-it" to "listen-in" to the work of NASA
Mission Control in Houston or Florida communicating with the
astronauts of the Space Shuttle.

The actual marketing name of this "new" AT&T service was called
"Dial-IT 900" (tm).

For most of the 1980's, AT&T had *FAR FEWER* 900-NXX codes in use for
the 1980-on "Dial-IT 900" service than they had 900-NNX codes assigned
to specific destination cities on the 900 "Mass Calling" service. But
"Dial-IT 900" became much more visible in the public's mind than the
old "mass calling" 900 had been.

The network operations for "Dial-IT 900" was where about seven or
eight SELECTED #4ESS toll machines were made to be "900 MAS hubs" (MAS
being the Mass Announcement System).

Something like a live "listen-in-only" conference would be fed on
DEDICATED trunks to each of the 4ESS offices serving as 900 'MAS'
hubs.  Or vote tallying would be done at each of the 4ESS toll offices
that were 900 'MAS' hubs. Or everyone calling a particular
"sports-line" would route to their nearest 900 'MAS' hub 4E, and then
route over DEDICATED trunks to the facility providing the
"sports-line". The "regular" toll network coast-to-coast wouldn't have
been "overloaded" because the 'MAS' network itself was a separate
dedicated "sub-network" of its own.

In the vote-tallying situation, every so often, each 900 'MAS' hub 4E
would send results over *dedicated* data links to the central facility
handling the "vote", or else the results could be "dumped" when the
"vote" or "election" was officially over.

The rates that AT&T was tariffed to charge were somewhat nominal
compared to what 900 numbers have cost since the late 1980's!

- 900-200 and 900-555 (at that time) were *FREE*;

- 900-410 was 50-cents the first min, 35-cents each additional min;

- and the *handful* of other (AT&T) 900-NXX codes in use in the early
1980's were intended for "short" calls, such as "voting", and were
billed at 50-cents/call.

These rates are "expensive" compared to what one would pay for POTS
toll calls today, even many OVERSEAS calls. But back in the
early-to-mid 1980's, 50-c the first min and 35-c each add minute was
really "in line" with what DAY rates from one coast to the other was
back at that time!  It was probably even cheaper than most calls to
Canada were back then too!

AT&T probably did "share" some revenue, but considering that the rates
being charged weren't all that "expensive", it wasn't really a "cash
cow" for either AT&T or for an "information provider". When TV events
had "votes" (with different 900- numbers for each option to "vote"
for), they usually said that what revenue was collected would be given
to a charity.

This was more-or-less the way 900 was until around 1986 or so, a
couple of years AFTER divestiture. Bellcore, which was carved out of
the old AT&T Bell System but owned by the seven regional Bell holding
corporations, was now the NANP Administrator. The LD telephone
industry had decided that 900 would become "competitive". Toll-Free
800 was becoming "competitive" at the same time, with temporary
assignments of 800-NXX codes to specific carriers (that is, until 1993
at which time FULL portability came about).  The same plan was
designed for "900 service", where requesting carriers would be
assigned specific 900-NXX codes. AT&T's already-in-use 900-NXX codes
(and also Telecom Canada's as well), would be "grandfathered"
assigned.

So now, circa 1996/97, 900 was becoming "competitive". AT&T started
charging a whole variety of rates for specific 900-NXX codes. Some
900-NXX codes were 25-c/min, some 35-c/min; some with a slightly
higher rate for the first min (not just the previous 50-c/1st +
35/add) such as some that were $1.50 first-min + 50-c add-min; some
900-NXX codes had fixed "per-call" rates of varying rates, such as
40-c/call, or $1.00/call, or $2.00/call, or $5.00/call or even
$10.00/call! The specific rate was determined by which 900-NXX code
was used, and by 1989, AT&T even went down to specific rate steps
based on the "thousand" of the 900-NXX code!  i.e., the specific
dialed 900-NXX-X...

And, there were OTHER players now requesting their own 900-NXX codes
be assigned to them by Bellcore-NANPA, and they were activating the
services with originating access/translations in the local telco
c.o.switches, and routing the "long-haul" by leasing or using out-WATS
from MCI, Sprint, etc. Many of these "new" 900 services were for all
*KINDS* of "sleaze", such as sex/porno or psychic fraud.

The real downturn of 900 began when the "other" players began to enter
the "market", starting around 1988 or so. And these "other players"
either got into the business because of the (so-called) "cash cow"
status, or else they got their partners/investors involved using the
"cash cow" aspects.

Also in the later 1980's, more and more state utility regulators began
requiring local telcos to offer optional FREE BLOCKING against "local"
type 976 "special" c.o.code. Thus more of these "other" service(?)
providers began to switch over to "offering their wares" using special
area code 900, thus tarnishing the "reasonably" good reputation that
AT&T had on "Dial-IT 900". By the late 1980's, AT&T began to change
the name of their 900 to "MultiQuest". Also, because of the amount of
SLEAZE that crept in in just a few short years, the FCC and Congress
came up with new rules on how 900 could be "provided" by telco, the LD
carriers, and the "information provider", as well as requiring that
all local telcos and LD carriers provide optional FREE BLOCKING
AGAINST being able to dial/reach the 900 Special Area Code and most
OTHER such special c.o.codes locally.  FCC/Congress-mandated optional
free blocking against 900 (and others) began around December 1990.

For the most part, it seems like the 900 "industry" has started to
dwindle or "dry up", in the past five or so years. As was mentioned
earlier, AT&T is eliminating the billing-and-collection services of
their own 900-NXX codes numbers/services, and might eventually
discontinue their version of 900 (MultiQuest) *altogather* by 2003 or
2004.

The only two "legit" LD-carriers which provided 500 "Personal"
Numbering were AT&T and MCI. Both of them have COMPLETELY DISCONTINUED
their versions of 500. One of a NUMBER of reasons 500 never really
became popular is that since 900 had a "bad name" in the minds of most
of the public, a lot of the SLEAZE were trying to do the SAME thing
with 500! :(

I guess that most of the sleaze-types will eventually all have
800/888/etc numbers, and under regulation and laws, you aren't
supposed to be charged "just for dialing" an 800/etc. number ... so
they might eventually have to just use "toll-free" numbers (toll-free
to the calling party as far as telco is concerned), but then you have
to touchtone/key a previously arranged account-number/passcode -- or a
(commercial) credit card number (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX, etc).

So, as far as SAC 900 goes ...

The 1970's era was Bell System "Mass Calling" or a "choke" network
where dedicated 900-NNX codes were assigned to specific destination
cities, and the network was intended for calls to (nationwide)
customers who expected high-volume incoming calls on a "massive"
basis; billing was at tariffed "POTS" distance (V&H/ratecenter to
V&H/ratecenter) rates;

The 1980's era (until 1987/88/89 or so) was AT&T's "Dial-IT 900" of
calling to specific "information" services, billed at "nominal" fixed
type rates;

The 1990's era (since around 1988 or so) is when competition of 900
had begun, and the sleaze element had completely taken over! :(

A "rod staked in the earth somewhere" may have been permissible once
upon a time, but, at least here in the USA, recent editions of the
National Electrical Code require that all utility facilities entering
a building must be bonded together and grounded to an approved
grounding electrode.  "All" includes electric power, telephone, cable
TV, communications system, and alarm systems (it might be a bit
embarrassing if a fire-alarm system set the building on fire).
 
Recent codes also require that the electrician installing electric
service at any new building must provide an "accessible means external
to enclosures" for other services' grounds.  The accessible means can
be a screw terminal, an exposed #6 copper wire, a steel power mast, or
a metal raceway.  However it's provided, it has to be something that
the cable guy and the telco guy can attach their ground wires to
without having to rip the building apart or open any power-equipment
enclosures.

In many older structures, power-grounding electrodes weren't
accessible, which is why telco and cable TV installers used to install
separate groundrods.  The current code specifically prohibits this:
telco and cable TV service drops *must be* bonded to the power ground
even if it means running a ground wire clear across a basement, or
running a ground wire to a water pipe or a garden-hose spigot.

Back in my cable TV days, I used to tell my guys that the only time
they could drive a groundrod was for a customer who lives in a tent
and has a battery-operated TV set, but doesn't have electricity, a
phone, or running water.

I once encountered a gas station in Michigan that had a ground-start
payphone.  The owner kept a special bolt, about 6" long, in his desk
drawer.  The bolt was just long enough to connect the payphone
enclosure to a nearby light switch box.

PBX trunks are typically ground-start to prevent "glare," the situation
that would arise if, say, a motel guest dialed 9 and found herself
connected to an incoming call.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: How does ground start help prevent
glare? If your outbound seizure of a trunk line (whether by loop 
start or ground start) occurs precisely at the same instant as my
inbound seizure (not unlikely in the case of a heavily trafficed
PBX) then we will still glare at each other. Normally glare is 
prevented by putting outbound trunks in a different place than the
inbound trunks. If the switchboard only has one group of trunks to
be used for both inbound and outbound then inbound calls arrive in
hunt sequence, i.e. your listed directory number is xxx-1000, then
incoming calls arrive on 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003, etc; all callers 
dialing 1000 and hunting upward. Let's say your group of lines runs
 from 1000 through 1019, to give you an even twenty lines. The
outbound traffic then seizes in order 1019, 1018, 1017, 1016, etc. Now
glare only becomes an unlikely possibility when the two streams meet
in the middle, backwards at 1010 and 1009 and upwards at the same
point, and that would likely only occur during the busy hours. That
is how you reduce glare; you can only eliminate it totally if you
have a place for outbound only trunks totally separate. How is
ground start supposed to eliminate it? Please tell me.  PAT]

Lycos and Google have released their annual roundups of the year's
most popular Internet search terms, and between them, they offer some
interesting -- and sometimes surprising -- insight into popular
culture.

Lycos' Web's Most Wanted lists the top 100 search terms for 2002.  The
top item is "Dragonball," a Japanese anime that first appeared in 1984
and has since spawned videos, games and all kinds of toys.

Although unknown to many adults, Dragonball is the first subject to
top the list two years in a row, thanks to its popularity with kids
and teens, according to Lycos.  (Lycos' Web's Most Wanted is published
by Terra Lycos, Wired News' parent company.)

In fact, most of Lycos' popular search terms are geared toward a
younger demographic.  Names of file-sharing applications, pop music
and sports stars, video games, movies and TV shows dominate the 2002
list.

By SIMON ROMERO

Will the price of international telephone calls continue to decline?
And will more people choose wireless technology over land lines? The
answers lie in whether new technologies continue to rival existing

A glance across the humbled telecommunications industry might suggest
that its largest companies are worried about other pressing issues in

After all, telecommunications and technology companies lost $7.6

By ROBERT HANLEY

NEWARK, Dec. 17 - A former computer expert with UBS PaineWebber was
indicted today on federal charges of trying to manipulate the stock
price of the brokerage's parent company by sabotaging its computer
system last spring, the authorities said.

The United States attorney for New Jersey, Christopher J. Christie,
said the suspect, Roger Duronio, 60, of Bogota, N.J., hoped to cash in
on a resulting drop in the stock value of the parent company, UBS.

The indictment said Mr. Duronio spent nearly $22,000 in February and
March buying a type of security known as a put option contract, which
increases in value as a company's stock price declines. Mr. Christie
said the plan failed when a computer virus that Mr. Duronio personally
transmitted to 1,000 of the 1,500 computers used by PaineWebber
brokers across the country failed to disrupt work seriously or cause a
sharp change in the stock price.

Subject: Time for Everyone to Get Serious About Firewalls


By Hiawatha Bray, Globe Staff, 12/16/2002

There's nothing like getting a computer for Christmas -- especially if
it's somebody else's.

If your machine's on the Internet, it's under near-constant attack
from people who'd like to 'own' it. And if some digital crook can read
all of your files or install a piece of rogue software on your
machine, you might as well give him the sales receipt as well.

Everybody frets about viruses, rightly enough. But computer users are
only just starting to get serious about protecting their machines from
network intruders. Firewalls -- software programs that analyze and
regulate exchanges of data between your computer and the Internet --
aren't a foolproof solution, but they are a minimal requirement for
safe surfing. Yet millions of us don't use them, even as they become
cheaper, simpler, and more desperately needed.

Firewall protection is especially important for those with broadband
connections. Today, 20 percent of America's home Internet users have
high-speed cable or DSL service. That means a lot more than the
ability to download entire movies. Broadband also lets you stay
connected around the clock, so you can snatch e-mail or send instant
messages without a tedious dial-up delay. This blessing is also a
curse. Now that millions of home machines are online all the time,
they're easy prey for computer vandals who search the Internet for
vulnerable machines.

December 16, 2002, 4:00 AM PT

WASHINGTON--Why is everyone so surprised that the U.S. government
wants to create a Total Information Awareness database with details
about everything you do?

This is an unsurprising result of having so much information about 
our lives archived on the computers of our credit card companies, our 
banks, our health insurance companies and government agencies.

Now a Defense Department agency is devising a way to link these 
different systems together to create a kind of digital alter ego of 
each of us. After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, this proposed 
centralization was inevitable -- and it's only going to get worse.

Blame retired Admiral John Poindexter, national security adviser for
former President Ronald Reagan, who returned to the Pentagon in
February to run a creepy new agency that's trying to create this
mammoth surveillance and information-analysis system. It's called
Total Information Awareness, and it's funded by the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying it's a good idea, or that it's
consistent with the traditional American values of limited government
and a sharp demarcation between the private and the public sector.
I'm not even sure if Poindexter's brainchild could ever work.

What I am saying is that if our personal information -- some of it 
extraordinarily sensitive -- is archived in corporate or government 
databases and protected only by the weak shield of the law, it's 
vulnerable to federal snoops.

Subject: Verdict Seen As Blow to DMCA


By Joanna Glasner
02:00 AM Dec. 18, 2002 PT

Critics of a controversial U.S. copyright law applauded a jury's 
decision Tuesday to acquit a Russian software firm charged with 
creating an illegal encryption-disabling program. The verdict, they 
say, will make prosecutors more reluctant to pursue similar cases.

The acquittal, announced in federal district court in San Jose, 
California, brought to a close the first federal criminal trial of a 
company accused of violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. 
The defendant, Moscow company ElcomSoft, was accused of violating 
provisions of the 1998 statute that prohibits companies from creating 
and selling technologies that circumvent protections placed on 
copyrighted works.

By exonerating ElcomSoft, DMCA critics say the jury showed an
unwillingness to convict a company merely for creating a program that
others might use to commit acts of copyright infringement.

Members of the jury indicated that the turning point was when the
witness from Adobe admitted in cross examination that they had not
been able to find one, single purloined copy produced by that
software. If the prosecution is going to claim that a product's
purpose is to produce pirate copies, then it would make sense that one

I have an MCI billing problem too ... I had MCI local service in Los
Angeles for a few months in 1996. The service was cancelled, I moved.
Yet, I am **STILL** being billed for MCI local service.

Every time I call, takes the longest time to get through, they credit
the account and promise to get rid of it, yet the next month, it all
starts over.

I've written on the bills and disconnect notices (many of them) and
mailed em in, all to no avail.

Now, I just tear the bills up, not even opening them.

PBX trunks are typically ground-start for several reasons, and one of
those reasons is to REDUCE glare.  As with the approach of reversing
the hunt sequence, all that can be achieved is a reduction of the
statistical liklihood of glare occurring.  It's worth remembering
that nobody can -- or should even be able to -- guarantee the order
in which the CO hunts PBX trunks ... if the CO always hunted trunks
in the same order, a line fault on an early choice trunk would have
a seriously detrimental effect on the service.  Many COs will hunt
PBX groups -- particularly large groups -- in a pseudo-random order.

When the CO connects to a PBX line, it will connect to both legs of
the line, with balanced battery and earth, and there will then be a
brief period before the CO applies any form of ring signal.  Without
ground start trunks, the only way the PBX can detect that the line has
been seized by the CO for an inbound call is by detecting the ring.

There would, therefore, be an unguarded period of up to (worst case)
two seconds during which the PBX could attempt an outbound call on the
same trunk, and so cause glare.

With Ground Start trunks, the PBX can monitor the trunk and if for
ANY reason it sees battery AND ground, it will treat the trunk as
"busy" and will not offer any outgoing calls to it.  This same
technique deals with those cases where an outside caller does not
clear down, even though the PBX user has cleared -- in any public
networks that implement calling-party-clear it would otherwise be
possible for an extension making an outgoing call to pick up a CO
trunk on which the previous incoming caller had still not cleared.
Taking this a step further, it also copes well with cases where a
party needs to "flash" the Telco operator - the connection can be
held up even though the calling extension has briefly gone on-hook
in order to send the "flash".

> you can only eliminate it totally if you have a place for outbound
> only trunks totally separate.

And not even then, if you consider the case where the Telco operator
is able to use reverse-hold on a 911 (US)/112 (EU) or equivalent call.

All this certainly applies to many UK/Australian/New Zealand PBXs; as
is inevitably the case, your kilometrage may and probably will vary!


Richard D G Cox
Penarth, UK

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Well, the same thing is true in the USA
and Canada. Either the 911 operator or the telco operator (in order to
ring back to ask for additional money for example) can hold onto a
line, even if the line is in other regards one-way outgoing only. Merely
hanging up the receiver does not work, if the operator, the switch
technician or the 911 operator wants to reach you back. PAT]

As I understand it, back in the good old days when we didn't have
immediate ring, ground start prevented glare by connecting battery to
the line when there was an incoming call. The PABX would bypass a line
with battery on it when looking for a free line, thus, minimal glare.

Now a days, as some PBX's won't drop a loop either because it doesn't
detect disconnect supervision or the CO doesn't give disconnect
supervision, ground start can prevent a person from staying on the
line to get new dial tone from the CO, thus bypassing any SMDR and
toll controls the PBX may have in place.

Plus, ground start is just neat :)

While I don't like to pee on anyone's party, it should be pointed out
that the author of this book has a vested interest in pointing you
towards those companies in which the author apparently has an
interest.  The author points out that some of these LD deals go
through commissioned "distributors."  While there's some very good
information in the 'book' it does not appear on the surface that it is
not entirely unbiased.

Replies are seldom read.  Please reply in the group


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Did you really mean those double-negatives
which appear in your final sentence? 'does not appear' 'not entirely

Yeah, you are.  It's called "the court of public opinion".  By posting

Very little difference when it comes to the matters under discussion.

It's YOUR point that national brands "sometimes" mean something.  It's
OUR point that national brands "most of the time" mean something
(although we concede that this appears to be slowly changing, for the
worse, particularly in the telecom biz).

Perhaps.  You've been unlucky, though, in that your company is not a

You did say (or at least imply) that virtually no national branding has

Another red herring.  Nobody said anything about it not counting.
What we're saying is that the "problem" seems especially
focused/severe in that particular industry, and that because you've
got your blinders on, it appears to you to be a pervasive problem
throughout all industries.  We're saying that that's not the case.

> I never said that the technology world represented anything. But you

If I may add a point, here.  Every company in every industry has to
start somewhere.  When the railroads first started, these companies
all started from scratch and came up with new names.  Within a short
period of time, a large number of these companies merged with other
companies, went bust, changed names, etc.  After a while, things
stabilized, and we now have "long standing" national brand names
arising from this.  I'll bet back in the 1800's people were making the
same arguments as you: national branding is a farce.

Similarly, there were posts here recently about the past history of
United Airlines, which arose out of many different airlines, aircraft
manufacturers, airport operators, etc.  From what I saw, the period of
the late 20's to the early 40's saw a gazillion name changes and
mergers which must have been very confusing to consumers.  But
eventually, "United Airlines" came out of it and was a very stable
"brand name" for many decades.

Why is the current situation in the telecom biz any different?  Yes,
the "telephone" business has been around for well over a century, but
the "telecommunications" business is really still in its infancy, when
you consider the dramatic changes involved.  Phone companies are now
offering internet access and a raft of other services that previously
didn't exist (just like railroads and airlines).  You may consider
these things to be an "extension" of their earlier business, but I view
it as a profound paradigm shift, and what we're seeing is the usual
shaking out of the weak.  Thirty years from now, the name "SBC" may be
well ingrained into our consciousness as a "national brand".  Or it may
be some other name yet to come.  But one way or another, the shakeout
will end and stability will result.  Eventually.  :-)

Believe me, there were more than a few of us up here north of the
border cheering on the Hurricanes during last year's amazing run.  Not
so much because they took out the Canadiens (though I'm a
Canadien-hater), but because they took out the Toronto "Centre Of The
Universe" Maple Leafs.  :-) Any team that knocks off any Toronto team
earns my respect.  :-)

Yes and no. Today's "HP" is no longer the company founded by Hewlett and 
Packard. It is now right in there with all the other "me too" 
reshufflers and resellers. It can't wait to fire a significant portion 
of its workforce and it is in the process of homogenizing its product 
lines. That famous garage has morphed into endless offices full of paper 
shufflers.

A more fitting name for the downtown hockey stadium would be Fiorina 
Arena. I can't think of a more appropriate tribute to the woman who 
brought a great company to its knees.

Well, sort of. I have to admit that when I heard "Compaq Center", I 
thought of Houston. But now that Hewlett-Packard is gone (the company 
has been offically renamed "HP", mainly as a slap to the founders' 
families ... who were against the merger with Compaq) the significance of 
the name no longer exists.

Actually, the Budweiser you get in Germany is very good.  Of course,
it's not brewed by Anheuser-Busch, but by the original brewery in
Budvar, Czech Republic.  Old Augustus Busch knew that it was a
well-known brand name among the German immigrants in St. Louis in the
1870s, so he just slapped that name on his light lager beer, without
asking the Budvar brewery first (this was in the days before
international copyright laws).

There have been some on and off negotiations between A-B and Budvar,
but they've never amounted to anything.  As a result there are several
European countries where A-B can't sell anything called "Budweiser".
For a while, it was called simply "B", but now I think that it's
called "Bud".

Ameritech's IT division was particularly enamored of outsourcing and 
contractors.  They'd outsourced their entire data center operations to 
IBM, and had apparently adopted the "Microsoft model" of contract 
programmers, analysts, etc. It wasn't unusual for a contractor to have 
worked for AIT for 4-5 years.

SBC, after the merger, reversed most of those policies.  The data center 
operations went back in house (most of the staff was hired from IBM - 
many of whom had gone from Ameritech to IBM just a few years earlier), 
and all IT contracts were limited to 12 months (with an option for an 
additional 6 months).  A lot of the long time contractors were hired as 
full time employees.  The resulting cost savings were in the several 
millions of dollars.

Yes, you're just lucky that you haven't had to declare bankruptcy.  Or
maybe you're just unlucky that no one has considered your company
attractive enough to pay you lots of money to acquire it.

I don't know where you got the idea that name changes are spontaneous
or capricious.  They're a consequence of other changes in the
business, primarily mergers and acquisitions.

If the company is publicly traded, it can be taken over at any time,
at which point the acquiring company may well choose to change the
name.  Even in the case of a privately held company, the owner can't
really predict what his great-grandson will do after Great-Grandad has
passed away, or be certain that the business won't be sold at some
point (possibly because of inheritance taxes).

I've *never* heard of mainstream washers, dryers, ranges, etc. being
imported to the U.S. from overseas in significant quantities, though
Hoover did sell some Japanese two-tub compact washers three decades
ago.  Mexico is a different matter, but the appliances that GE imports
from there (including, oddly enough, *gas* ranges) are engineered by
GE.  In short, the GE washers and dryers, and most other large
appliances, are truly GE products, and those under the Whirlpool brand
are actual Whirlpool products; they aren't generic.  (GE and others do
import microwave ovens from Asia, since unlike the big stuff the
transportation costs aren't unreasonable.)

> Or how about TV sets? RCA or Emerson? Two fine, American brands ...

Uh-uh.  Thomson, the parent of RCA, designs most of its own products,
sometimes in France, a lot of the time in Indiana.  (VCRs and
camcorders are the big exceptions, since the major Asian suppliers
have those segments down cold.  Even so, RCA VCRs are customized to
provide the features that Thomson wants to offer.)  Emerson sells
whatever it can get from various suppliers.

In short, *if you know where to look,* you can often find products
that do have unique selling points, in many fields.

I don't care who is responsible. It is still a mistake to muck with the 
brand name if "national branding" is important.

I recall a recent case where some hotel chain was going on at length
about protecting its "brand name" and it is image. Yet, as I stated
before, the hotels around SFO shuffle brand names routinely. One
particular hotel has carried the names of five national hotel chains
in the last decade alone. Just how meaningful can those names be if
they are carried by a single establishment?

I have sold companies before, and I have watched the new owners 
literally toss the company's reputation and indentity into the garbage. 
I had to wonder why they bothered to buy the company.

The decision to change a name requires an affirmative action by the
board. I assume that human beings are consciously doing this. Of
course, there is the flip side: names that continue for decades, while
the underlying company is literally merged and acquired out of
existence.

In neither case is the significance of national brands preserved.

All you are telling me is that leadership changes at a company. Well,
duh! My unrefuted assertion is that someone (or a board of directors)
must take affirmative steps to change the name of a company. Why would
they do that (be they grandsons or hostile purchasers) when it dilutes
and nullifies the national name recognition?

Obviously, you haven't examined them very closely. I have. They not
only use idential parts, the chassis, panels, knobs, and trim were
obviously stamped from the same dies.

Well, that's good generic advice. If you know where to look, you can
get just about anything you want. Unfortunately, you have to look
beyond the brand names. And that's my point.

Another biggie is "nyc.gov".

What happend is that in The Bad Old Days of One Internic, It Doesn't
Work, the registrar (Network Solutions back then) would grant a *.gov
to any group, whether federal, state, or local, that was, ahem, a
gov't entity (or close enough, as in panynj.gov)

Roughly five years ago they amended that policy to only give out *.gov
to agencies at the federal level. But the earlier adopters were
grandfathered in and could keep the names.

Personally I think that restriction was a mistake, but that's neither
here nor there.  And yes, I realize that "va.gov" could be confusing.

Oh, and now we get such wonderful names as, yes, "smallpox.gov".

SBC will have to figure out how to cash my checks made out to "Pacific

regularly change the name on checks made out to vendors. Pager checks
are still made out to "AirTouch"; telephone service checks are still

count me out of the shuffle.

I seem to recall a case where no one bothered to ask if it would be OK
to try to choke the network, during a Miss America Pagent.  Actually
it seems no one involved realized they were about to do just that.

The pagent officials announced on the air 10 phone numbers that
viewers could call to register their vote for one of the ten
finalists.

As I heard the story, a lone AT&T network engineer at the AT&T network
operations center in Bedminster was watching the Miss America pagent
on TV -- there are lots of TVs in the center to pick up any disaster
that might require network management controls -- and so he was able
to put in some number specific outgoing and incoming choke controls
especially on the higher toll switches.  But that wasn't really
enough.  The story continues the next year they did it right, using
designed choke networks.

Is that actually possible using caller ID?  Do you actually see a country

Here in England such incoming calls are only flagged as "International" on

Call them hackers of the last computing frontier: The GNU Radio coders
believe that any device with a chip should be able to do, well,
anything.


By Sam Williams

Dec. 18, 2002 | It's the vision that elicited a beatific smile from
Alan Turing, a Bela Lugosi-like cackle from John von Neumann, and a
cannabis-tinged giggle from 1970s-era PC creators: Imagine a universal
machine, a computation device capable of mimicking the functionality
of any other machine.

OK, now imagine the looks of terror on the faces of existing machine
makers. Imagine if the only thing stopping your handheld PDA from
simultaneously being a GPS receiver, phone, radio or miniature TV was
your willingness to download and install some free software program.

For Eric Blossom, founder of the GNU Radio project, the vision plays
itself over and over again, like a Mobius film strip. An electrical
engineer by trade, Blossom knows better than most the thin barriers
that separate one person's garage-door opener from another person's
global positioning satellite receiver. He also knows the proprietary
barriers that hinder technological innovation. Rather than curse those
walls, Blossom has decided to gut the floor plan entirely with the
help of free software. Sony, Philips and Nokia be damned.

Subject: Microsoft to bump Apple into sync-hole?


By Joe Wilcox
Staff Writer, CNET News.com

Apple Computer is refining a strategy for connecting cell phones and
other portable devices to its Macintosh systems in an effort to boost
sales.

But a rival endeavor from Microsoft, expected to be unveiled early
next year, could dim the company's hopes, analysts said.

Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple is nearing the end of a long testing
cycle for iSync, its software for synchronizing information between
Macs, Bluetooth-enabled cell phones, personal digital assistants or
the company's iPod music player.

The software, due for release early next year and currently available 
in a beta version, lets consumers and business users input data once 
and replicate it to many different devices.

That's why synchronization software is shaping up as a key
battleground for Apple and Microsoft. As consumers shift spending away
from PCs to more portable devices, such as cell phones or digital
music players, controlling the key element for synchronizing data on
these devices with computers is becoming increasingly important, say
analysts.

Although no projections for the value of the synchronization software
market are available, analysts said control of the market could be
hugely profitable.

Subject: Cable Firms, TV Makers in Digital TV Deal


By Reuters
December 18, 2002, 7:02 PM PT

Television makers and cable operators have reached a deal that would
allow digital signals to pass seamlessly over their equipment,
clearing a cumbersome hurdle in the transition to digital television,
people familiar with the situation said Wednesday.

The two industries were expected to announce the deal Thursday,
ensuring that the roughly 70 million homes that subscribe to cable
will be able to enjoy the crisp pictures and advanced features digital
signals offer, the sources said.

Originally designed to be complete by 2007, the digital switch has yet
to take off due to the high cost of new digital televisions, limited
programming and disputes over how consumers can record their favorite
shows without bootlegging them over the Internet.

For months, cable operators and TV makers had been at loggerheads over
compatibility standards as well, but the deal to be announced Thursday
will allow a seamless "plug-and-play" connection from the cable wire
to the television, the sources said.

This also has the possible side-effect of screwing up your credit

That's why Universal City Studios, in the "Betamax" case, not only
sued Sony but also one person who was observed recording and playing
back an MCA TV show, as well as the store where he bought the TV/VCR
console and the distributor they got it from.  Universal didn't seek
any damages from this fellow; a Mr. Griffiths, who was actually a
client of Universal's law firm; they simply wanted to establish the
chain between Sony and an actual instance of alleged infringement.

Should have been "While there's some very good information in the
'book' it *does* appear on the surface that it is not entirely
unbiased."

Maybe you *should* write a detailed "unbiased" report on LD service.

I know there have been several places and organizations that have
attempted to help make informed decisions, but I've found that even
they do have some bias which can be influenced by sponsorships and the
like.  One in particular that I've used to help untangle quoted or
advertised rates as opposed to what the real costs are is abelltolls
<http://abtolls.com> which while somewhat unbiased still don't list
every carrier everywhere and there's some influence in that some of
the carriers listed do "help" with the cost of running the service.  I
think it's a gargantuan task to do comparisonson *everything* as
there's so much of everything to make a comparison to.  Same goes for
comparisons of cellular/mobile service.  I've been to several
comparison sites and generally they won't have everything listed
that's available.  They may have the most popular things listed or
they may only list those carriers that they have a vested interest in
promoting.  My general feeling is that any sites that do comparisons
whether it's LD rates or mobile service won't be as unbiased if they
themselves are part of the business that they are trying to compare or
promote.

Replies are seldom read.  Please reply in the group.


[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: Maybe I will do that, in the form of a
large collection of messages from you readers. I could not begin to
do it as a solo project without some assistance; i.e. financial help;
i.e. the impartiality gets on shaky grounds. But if I had four or five
hundred messages on various carriers, the programs they offer, etc and
organized them according to carrier; type of offering; cost and other
factors then it would cost me very litle also. It might be a very
useful file for netizens. I could put it all on a web site and offer
it for free as a truly impartial guide. Ideas on this, anyone?   PAT]

John! I agree, but at this point we are tilting against windmills. We lost
this one. Let's fight the next one a little smarter.

Hey! I use 854's and am real happy with them. The DID feature is the

By the time I got the following response written, two other readers
(Richard D G Cox and Henry C. Henhouse) had already posted responses
to PAT's question.  Their points are well taken, particularly in
regard to two issues I hadn't mentioned: call-clearing and bypassing
toll-recording devices.

Nevertheless, here's my answer to PAT's original question ...

First, some background information: When a PBX trunk is idle, the
following DC voltages are present:

     LOOP START:
         Tip  = ground
         Ring = -48 volts (approximately)

     GROUND START:
         Tip  = open (or at least not grounded)
         Ring = -48 volts (approximately)

DC signaling between the CO and the PBX over a ground-start trunk works
as follows:

  - PBX SEIZES TRUNK FIRST: The PBX tests each trunk until it finds
    an idle one (ungrounded tip), then grounds the ring lead.  The
    CO senses the ring ground and immediately grounds the tip lead.
    The PBX senses the tip ground, releases the ring ground, and
    closes the loop.  The CO senses current flow and returns dialtone,
    but it maintains the tip ground for the duration of the call.
 
  - CO SEIZES TRUNK FIRST: The CO tests each trunk until it finds
    an idle one (ungrounded ring), then immediately grounds the
    tip.  It also applies ringing voltage, either concurrently
    with tip ground or shortly thereafter.  The PBX senses the
    ringing voltage, and closes the loop, answering the call.  The
    CO maintains tip ground for the duration of the call.

Note that in either of these scenarios, the CO grounds the tip
immediately after *either end* seizes the trunk, and maintains it for
the duration of the call (although, according to Harry Newton, that
"ground" can actually be separated from true ground by as much as 550
ohms).  Nevertheless, the ungrounded tip condition exists only when
the trunk is idle; during call setup and the call itself, tip is
grounded.

Now consider what happens when the PBX goes looking for an idle trunk
for an outgoing call:

  - LOOP-START: Because the tips are always grounded, the PBX has no
    way to identify an about-to-be-busy trunk (a trunk that the
    CO has already seized, but hasn't yet started ringing), so the
    PBX may seize it too.  Hence, glare.

  - GROUND-START: The PBX can instantly identify an about-to-be-
    busy trunk by testing for tip ground.  It can test each trunk
    in sequence, and skip past the busy ones until it finds a
    trunk with ungrounded tip.

All that said, there still may be a possibility of glare.  Under the
best of circumstances, it still takes a finite amount of time for the
switch at either end of the line to sense that a ground has been
asserted at the other end.  According to one source (Clare, Inc.), if
this interval exceeds 100 milliseconds, glare may still occur:
<http://www.clare.com/home/PDFs.nsf/www/an-150.pdf/$File/an-150.pdf>.

So it still may be a good idea to separate incoming trunks from outgoing
trunks, as PAT suggested.

Many modern PBXs have a further line of defense against glare: they
absorb the extension-user's dial string, then outpulse the call
according to some internal algorithm that may or may not utilize the
same string that the user originally entered.  A common example: in
most motels and hotels, dialing 9 (or 8 or 6 or whatever) doesn't
actually connect the guest to an outside line; it just tells the PBX
to process what follows as an outside call.  The PBX then decides how
to process the call, presumably using a ground-start trunk for the
purpose.

In any case, all of this assumes that the total number of trunks is
sufficient to handle the peak load.  If my experience is any guide,
lots of mid-sized mid-priced hotels/motels don't have enough trunks to
satisfy peak evening calling load.  The Holiday Inn Express in LaPorte
Indiana stands out in mind as the worst offender I've ever
encountered.  If dialing 9 from that hotel actually connected a guest
to a loop-start trunk, just about every incoming call would end up
glaring at a frustrated guest trying to get an outside line.  Even the
payphones in the lobby were jammed.
