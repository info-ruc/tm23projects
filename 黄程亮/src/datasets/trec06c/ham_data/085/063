CERT Advisory CA-2002-34 Buffer Overflow in Solaris X Window Font Service

   Original release date: November 25, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Sun Microsystems Solaris 2.5.1 (Sparc/Intel)
     * Sun Microsystems Solaris 2.6 (Sparc/Intel)
     * Sun Microsystems Solaris 7 (Sparc/Intel)
     * Sun Microsystems Solaris 8 (Sparc/Intel)
     * Sun Microsystems Solaris 9 (Sparc)

Overview

   The  Solaris  X  Window Font Service (XFS) daemon (fs.auto) contains a
   remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability that could allow an
   attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.

I. Description

   A  remotely  exploitable  buffer  overflow vulnerability exists in the
   Solaris  X Window Font Service (XFS) daemon (fs.auto). Exploitation of
   this   vulnerability  can  lead  to  arbitrary  code  execution  on  a
   vulnerable  Solaris  system.  This vulnerability was discovered by ISS
   X-Force.

   The  Solaris X Window Font Service (XFS) serves font files to clients.
   Sun describes the XFS service as follows:

     The X Font Server is a simple TCP/IP-based service that serves font
     files  to  its  clients. Clients connect to the server to request a
     font  set,  and  the  server  reads the font files off the disk and
     serves  them to the clients. The X Font Server daemon consists of a
     server binary /usr/openwin/bin/xfs.

   The  XFS daemon is installed and running by default on all versions of
   the   Solaris   operating   system.  Further  information  about  this
   vulnerability may be found in VU#312313.

     http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/312313

   This vulnerability is also being referred to as CAN-2002-1317 by CVE.

   Note  this  vulnerability  is in the X Window Font Server, and not the
   filesystem of a similar name.

II. Impact

   A  remote  attacker  can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
   the  fs.auto daemon (typically nobody) or cause a denial of service by
   crashing the service.

III. Solution

Apply a patch from your vendor

   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   As  vendors report new information to the CERT/CC, we will update this
   section  and note the changes in our revision history. If a particular
   vendor  is  not  listed  below,  we  have not received their comments.
   Please contact your vendor directly.

Disable vulnerable service

   Until  patches  can be applied, you may wish to disable the XFS daemon
   (fs.auto).  As  a  best practice, the CERT/CC recommends disabling all
   services  that  are  not  explicitly  required.  On  a typical Solaris
   system,  it  should  be  possible  to  disable  the  fs.auto daemon by
   commenting  out  the  relevant  entries  in  /etc/inetd.conf  and then
   restarting the inetd process.

Workarounds

   Block  access  to  port  7100/TCP at your network perimeter. Note that
   this will not protect vulnerable hosts within your network perimeter.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

NetBSD

   NetBSD  ships  the  xfs  from  XFree86,  though  its not on or used by
   default.

OpenBSD

   We do not have XFS.

SGI

   We're not vulnerable to this.

Sun Microsystems

   The  Solaris  X  font  server (xfs(1)) is affected by VU#312313 in the
   following supported versions of Solaris:

   Solaris 2.6
   Solaris 7
   Solaris 8
   Solaris 9

   Patches  are  being generated for all of the above releases.  Sun will
   be  publishing  a  Sun  Alert for this issue at the following location
   shortly:

   http://sunsolve.Sun.COM/pub-cgi/retrieve.pl?doc=fsalert/48879

   The patches will be available from:
