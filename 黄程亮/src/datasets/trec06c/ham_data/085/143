      Social movements have been around for as long as there has been=
=20
unfairness and people with opinions.  A social movement is a collecti=
ve=20
action taken by a group towards a common goal.  They may start off sm=
all,=20
with little active supporters, but with incentives and progress, the =
small=20
group is able to turn into a large movement that could affect a large=
=20
number of individuals.  The type of social movement I'm focasing on i=
s the=20
Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement.  This movement has sustained itself fo=
r a=20
long period of time, slowly gianing support.  Today the actions for t=
his=20
movement are stronger and louder.  Using sociological theories, I've =
formed=20
my opinion on the issue.  To first understand the Hawaiian's emotions=
, we=20
must take a look at their past.=20
      When Captain Cook came to Hawaii in 1778, the Hawaiians had alr=
eady=20
been living there with their own racial composition, language, and cu=
stoms.=20
 However, Captain Cooks so called =1B$BEE=1B(Biscovery=1B$BG=01=1B(Bo=
f the islands caused an=20
increase in the amount of people who wanted to make Hawaii home.  It =
stared=20
off with people such as European and American sailors, businessmen, a=
nd=20
missionaries.  Not only did Captain Cook bring people, but he also br=
ought=20
over many new diseases which killed many Hawaiians, who=1B$BCT=1B(B i=
mmune system was=20
not used to the new diseases.  This immigration of people into Hawaii=
=20
resulted in a decline of the Hawaiians population by about 90%.
=09As time progressed the Hawaiians were forced to keep up with the r=
apidly=20
changing economy and culture.  Then in 1893, a group of businessmen, =
backed=20
by three companies of US Marines, forced Queen Lili=1B$BCV=1B(Bokalan=
i from her=20
throne.  Thus the lands that had been under the rule of Queen Lili=
=1B$BCV=1B(Bokalani=20
were taken, ending Hawaii=1B$BCT=1B(B independence.  This angered the=
 Hawaiians, but=20
because of their few numbers and limited knowledge, they did nothing.=
  In=20
1959, the Hawaiians were given the option of wither becoming a state =
of=20
staying a territory of the United States.  Did the Hawaiians have a s=
ay in=20
this vote? I am not sure, however, Hawaii was voted to become a state=
. =20
=09Many argue the past events have put Hawaiians in a position that t=
hey were=20
never really able to move from.  Many people claim that because of Ha=
waiian
=1B$BCT=1B(B unfair past, some sort of compensation is and has been l=
ong overdue.=20
Hawaiians have had, ever since Cook had come in 1778, a rough time. =
=20
Naturally, many Hawaiians have expressed their anger and frustration =
subtly=20
till now.  Recently there has been a drastic increase in the efforts =
put=20
into the Hawaiian Sovereignty Movement. =20
=09In Hawaii today 40% of Hawaii=1B$BCT=1B(B homeless are native Hawa=
iians.  =1B$BE8=1B(Be pay=20

 and self-determination,=1B$BG=01=1B(B
argues Mahealani Kamau=1B$BCV=1B(B.  This statement does seem just, b=
ecause the=20
Hawaiians land was taken in 1893.  Along with the restoration of the =
lands=20
of Hawaii back to the Hawaiians, some are also calling for the restor=
ation=20
of the government run by only Hawaiians.  Many native Hawaiians feel =
that=20
their needs are not being met by the current political and economic s=
ystem.
=09More recently than in the past, the frustrations of the native Haw=
aiians=20
are being heard.  Either the support for this movement has grown or t=
he=20
activists are becoming bolder.  Sign wavers, pamphlets, numerous web-=
pages,=20
and many other indications prove that the Hawaiians want to be heard =
now. =20
Yet why now and not then? is the question on many sociologists minds.=
 =20
=09Social contagion, resource mobilization, rational choice, and rela=
tive=20
deprivation are some theories that try to explain this question.  In =
my=20
opinion all of the theories make contribute to the rise in support ov=
er the=20
years.  In my earlier essay I claimed that social contagion was the t=
heory=20
most responsible for this movement.  I still believe that the support=
 of=20
this movement could have risen, because of people imitating others on=
 the=20
basis of blood; however, I have come to put I do not think that that =
is the=20
main reason why this movement has grown. I believe that this movement=
 has=20
many free riders, who do not contribute anything to this movement exc=
ept=20
for numbers.  =20
Relative deprivation, on the other hand, makes a little more sense.  =
The=20
relative deprivation theory states that people compare themselves to =
those=20
around them.  This is a natural instinct of humans and in Hawaii ther=
e is a=20
large amount of rich people and there is a large amount of poor peopl=
e,=20
including Hawaiians.  Collective action is a way to achieve this. =
=20
Hawaiians make up one-fifth of Hawaii=1B$BCT=1B(B population, but the=
y also make up=20
the majority of the unskilled and homeless. =20
Resource mobilization also plays a role in this movement, because wit=
h today
=1B$BCT=1B(B technology it is easier to spread the issue and call for=
 support. =20
Therefore it is much easier than before for people to hear about this=
=20
issue.  Morally, the Hawaiians should have their land back and their =
form=20
of government back because it was taken from them.  They contribute g=
reatly=20
to the poor, uneducated, and homeless as a result of the settlement o=
f=20
foreigners in Hawaii.  This issue can easily be manipulated into a=
=20
political or economical opportunity, which many who support this move=
ment=20
will grasp onto.  For instance, almost all the books, films, and publ=
ic=20
events concerning the sovereignty issue have been highly biased in fa=
vor of=20
the native Hawaiians, argues Kenneth Conklin.  Before this topic was=
=20
introduced in class, I could say that I was for Sovereignty because i=
t only=20
seemed right and just.  I had learned their history and felt for them=
. =20
However, when I learned more of the issue and didn=1B$BCU=1B(B base m=
y judgment on=20
feelings, I changed my mind.  Media has been useful for the fight for=
=20
sovereignty.
=09=1B$BE8=1B(Be can=1B$BCU=1B(B turn back the hands of time,=1B$BG=
=01=1B(Bargues Billy Pa.  I agree with=20
him.  When the Hawaiian monarchy was overthrown and the Hawaiian=1B$B=
CT=1B(B land=20
taken, that was wrong.  However, with the way that the government is =
run,=20
it would be impossible to restore all the land to the Hawaiian people=
.  The=20
restoration of land in the most extreme case, argues that only Hawaii=

and people considered =1B$BEM=1B(Bocal=1B$BG=01=1B(Bfrom a certain pe=

in Hawaii.  Even if they end up not fighting to this extreme, giving =
land=20

=09Why haven=1B$BCU=1B(B people spoken up against it?  Well this is p=
robably due to the=20
fact that Hawaii is a small island, where everyone knows you through=
=20
somebody else.  Few are willing to take a stand against this movement=
=20
because many of their friends are for it, or they do not want to crea=

only natural for there to be less against it.  No body wants to stir =

 There=20

=09I believe that the support of this movement will continue to rise =
because=20
of the progress that the activists have been able to achieve.  The gr=
owth=20
of supporters over the years and the coverage that this issue has bee=

to reach strengthens the hope for this movement.  The fact that the=

beneficiaries of this movement are based on blood means that as long =
as the=20
movement is going well there will be supporters, including free rider=

non-Hawaiians will definitely be affected by it in a negative way.  I=

believe that so will the Hawaiians because since the statistics show =
