CERT Advisory CA-2002-37 Buffer Overflow in Microsoft Windows Shell

   Original release date: December 19, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * All versions of Microsoft Windows XP

Overview

   A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Microsoft Windows Shell.
   An  attacker  can  exploit  this vulnerability by enticing a victim to
   read  a malicious email message, visit a malicious web page, or browse
   to a folder containing a malicious .MP3 or .WMA file. The attacker can
   then execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the victim.

I. Description

   The   Microsoft   Windows  Shell  provides  the  basic  human-computer
   interface  for  Windows  systems.  Browsing  local and remote folders,
   running  wizards,  and  performing configuration tasks are examples of
   operations  utilizing  the  Windows  Shell.  Microsoft  describes  the
   Windows Shell as follows:

     The  Windows Shell is responsible for providing the basic framework
     of  the  Windows  user interface experience. It is most familiar to
     users  as the Windows Desktop, but also provides a variety of other
     functions  to  help  define the user's computing session, including
     organizing  files  and  folders,  and  providing the means to start
     applications.

   A  vulnerability  exists in the Windows Shell function used to extract
   attribute  information  from  audio  files.  This  function is invoked
   automatically  when a user browses to a folder containing .MP3 or .WMA
   files.  Further  information  about this vulnerability can be found in
   the following documents:

   Foundstone Research Labs Advisory FS2002-11
   Microsoft Security Bulletin MS02-072
   CERT/CC Vulnerability Note VU#591890

   A CVE candidate (CAN-2002-1327) has been assigned as well.

II. Impact

   An  attacker  can  either execute arbitrary code (which would run with
   the privileges of the victim) or crash the Windows Shell.
