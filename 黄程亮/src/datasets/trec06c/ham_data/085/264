hi. i've already contacted Ken, so i have a bit of info on this, but i am 
having issues rotating text within DMDX.  i need to be able to project a 
rotated image of 90degrees onto a screen.  so, for our Mac experiments we 
rely on our rotating monitor and pivot sorftware to do this.
i realize that i can create with image software a rotated image of text and 
then apply this to DMDX -- but is this possible within DMDX?  i have a 
rotating monitor with pivot software (for out PC) but this does not seem to 
be supported by DMDX - so going thru the calibrations for video output, 
when i rotate the screen resolution/display i get error messages saying 
"DMDX or DirectX does not support page flipping".  also, Ken confirmed that 
the video card, ATI Radeon VE, is useless with DMDX ...can you suggest a 
better one?   the major question here though is can i rotate a text image 
within DMDX (with or without rotating the monitor)?
any input on this problem i would appreciate tremendously!
thank you.
