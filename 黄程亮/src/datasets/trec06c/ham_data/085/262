   Not without changing the code and that would require sponsorship from 
you.  There's a good deal of quite complicated code in there that 
determines if a previous digital video frame needs erasing, my guess is 
that your video codec (the code that has been added to the operating system 
to handle whatever digital video format you are using) is taking some time 
to deliver the first frame of the video and in the interim DMDX is erasing 
the screen because it's algorithm has a hole in it and it's making the 
wrong decision.  You could try putting a no-erase ! in the digital video 
frame.  If that doesn't change anything you could try a different digital 
video format.
