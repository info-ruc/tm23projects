Dear colleagues,

I would like to recommend to your attention the recent result by

Olga Kosheleva, Vladik Kreinovich, Guenter Mayer, and Hung T. Nguyen,
"Computing the Cube of an Interval Matrix Is NP-Hard",
Proceedings of the 20th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing SAC'2005,
Santa Fe, New Mexico, March 13-17, 2005, pp. 1449-1453,

posted at Vladik's web site

http://www.cs.utep.edu/vladik/2004/tr04-28a.pdf

I myself consider the paper very interesting and important because it
shows that NP-hardness is present even in the "basics" od interval
computations.

Best wishes to all of you,

Jiri Rohn
