          LINEAR ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
                Special Issue on
    LINEAR AND NONLINEAR MODELS AND ALGORITHMS IN
    INTENSITY-MODULATED RADIATION THERAPY (IMRT)

Call for Papers

Linear Algebra and its Applications (LAA) is pleased to announce a special 
issue on "Linear and Nonlinear Models and Algorithms in 
Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT)".

IMRT is revolutionizing radiation therapy by putting at the disposal of 
the medical profession powerful tools to deliver higher radiation doses to 
tumors and lower radiation doses to critical organs in more accurate ways. 
The scientific effort is a multidisciplinary one in which radiation 
oncologists, other medical specialists, medical physicists, 
mathematicians, computer scientists and engineers collaborate to study 
many outstanding problems in treatment planning and delivery. The goal is 
to merge this expertise and discover IMRT solutions that can produce 
meaningful benefits to patients and consistent results to practitioners. 
In view of the ever-increasing role of mathematics, particularly linear 
algebra, optimization theory, operations research, and other applied 
branches in IMRT, we look forward to first-class original research 
submissions on all relevant aspects of IMRT, including image-guided 
radiation therapy (IGRT) which uses online imaging capabilities to reduce 
uncertainties in organ localization and allows response to changes in 
treatment geometry over time.

We welcome papers for the special issue within the entire scope of IMRT; 
topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

 	Algorithm engineering
 	Aperture weight optimization
 	Automated structure delineation
 	Column-generation methods for large problem formulations
 	Dose-volume constraints handling
 	Gantry angle optimization
 	Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT)
 	Large-scale matrix reduction and sparsing techniques
 	Mathematical programming and operations research methods in IMRT
 	Optimization of the segmentation process
 	Rigid and deformable registration
 	Sensitivity analysis for revised constraints or changed geometry
 	Sampling techniques over constrained volumes
 	Variance at risk methods for dose-volume modeling

The deadline for submission of papers is July 31, 2006.  Papers should be 
sent to any one of the four special editors, listed below, preferably PDF 
files as attachments to e-mail, and will be subject to normal refereeing 
procedures according to LAA standards. Go to: 
http://authors.elsevier.com/JournalDetail.html?PubID=522483&Precis=&popup= 
and click on: "Guide for Authors" (but do not use the online submission 
for this special issue).
