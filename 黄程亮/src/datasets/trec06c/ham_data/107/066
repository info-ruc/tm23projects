Dear J.C. Forster 

I´ ve a PCI-DIO24 installed on a computer (Windows XP) running DMDX. 

I wonder how to make a program in DMDX:

A- Questions about output signals

1) Is it necessary a keyword definition to be written in the parameter line for outputs ? Is Keyword <id "PIO12"> the correct form?

2) I read that I may use the <Output N> keyword to Output to PIO12 port. This must be written in the "Experimental items" each time that an output signal is sent?

3) Which number indicates "N" in the <Output N> keyword?

 

B- Questions about input signals

1) Again, I suppose that it is necessary a keyword definition to be written in the parameter line. It is not thus? Is Keyword <id "PIO12"> the correct form?

2) I need to use a two-button response box that is connected to the Pio card.

I think it mappes the responses to Bit1 and Bit2, but when I did the PIO Test in TimeDX, Bit8 and Bit9 changed from high to low. Can I use the inputs in that manner?



 

Thank´s you in advance
