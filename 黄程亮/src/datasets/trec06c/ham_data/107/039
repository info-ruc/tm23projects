   There isn't anything else you'll be using so the counters are 
it.  Either use a counter that keeps track of cents and has some cunning 
display or use whole dollars.

   I've built the gambling task at least once for someone in the Psychology 
department, can't remember who though.  It was with whole dollars.  The 
trick with displaying counters is that they are just appended to the 
frame's current text, displaying two values is going to need 
<ProgressiveX>.  Say C1 is the money in cents displaying it might be done 
with something like:

0 <set c2 = c1 / 100> <set c3 = c1 % 100> <px .4>
                         "Total $" <apc 2>, "." <apc 3>;

   Of course that's not the whole deal either, the cents is going to need a 
leading zero if it's less than 10 so you'll need a branch:

~1 <set c2 = c1 / 100> <set c3 = c1 % 100> <bi 3, c3 .lt. 10>;
2 <px .4> "Total $" <apc 2>, "." <apc 3> <bu 4>;
3 <px .4> "Total $" <apc 2>, ".0" <apc 3>;
~4;
                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X

   The bug stops here.
