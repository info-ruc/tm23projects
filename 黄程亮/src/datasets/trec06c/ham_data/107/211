   For sure.  When the scramble routines are not invoked with S or <s> 
scramble commands (like $ and \) are not removed from the item file.  So 
the item read routing comes along looking for a correct response indicator 
or an item number and finds a $ instead and chokes on it.

You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you could
