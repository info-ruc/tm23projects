CS382M-ers,

  A couple of announcements (repeated from class today):

1) HW #3 is due on Monday 10/17.  Since we want to distribute the 
solution set on Monday at the end of class, there will be no late days 
granted for HW #3 (as we voted and agreed on in class last week).

2) The midterm is next Wednesday 10/19.  You are responsible for:
   - everything covered in lecture (up to and including today)
   - all of the papers up to (but not including) the Jouppi paper
   - all of HW's
   - all of the textbook chapters we have covered - chap 1, 2, 3, 4 (but 
not all of the compiler complexity), first half of chap 5 (end of 
caching).

You should plan on bringing a non-programmable calculator and on 8 1/2 
x 11 sheet of notes (both sides is fine).  You may not use your 
textbook during the exam.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
