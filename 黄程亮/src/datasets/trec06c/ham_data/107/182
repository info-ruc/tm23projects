I have one very simple but efficient method for solution of the interval
equations.
If you have particular problem then you know more or less how the solution
y=y(t,h) behave (h is an interval parameter, t is a time). 

Then you can calculate the derivative of the solution y with respect to the
interval parameters [h] (i.e. dy/dh). That should be easy. You can calculate
this for the mid point of the interval [h]=[h_inf,h_sup]. If width of the
interval [h] (or interval vector) is sufficiently small and the sign of the
derivative is constant then you can calculate the extreme values of the
solution using the endpoints of the interval [h] (or interval vector). 
I know that this is very simply method but in many cases it is sufficient.
If you need more accurate results then you can expand the derivative using
Taylor series 

dy(h)/dh= dy(h0)/dh+ d^2y(h0)/dh^2*(h-h0)+.

and after that check the sign of the derivative. 
Look at high order monotonicity tests here:
http://andrzej.pownuk.com/~andrzej/publications/Pownuk%20A.,%20Numerical%20s
olutions%20of%20fuzzy%20partial%20differential%20equations%20and%20its%20app
lications%20in%20computational%20mechanics.pdf

If the interval [h] is very wide then you can divide it into smaller parts
and repeat above procedure. 
If the sign of the derivative is not constant then . you can divide the
interval [h] into smaller parts and check monotonicity again. Well if the
solution behave really bad 
then . . I do not know what to do :). 
Some information about the solution you can get after calculation of the
solution for the endpoints of the interval [h] and some points in the middle
of the interval [h]. However the results may be very inaccurate.

Above described algorithms do not give you the results with guaranteed
accuracy . however sometimes . in my case (civil mechanical engineering
examples) these methods give you accurate results in 90% of cases (in my
opinion). If one calculate the interval solution using above described
methodology then the interval solution has always physical interpretation. 
There are lot of engineering papers in which the solution is calculated only
for endpoints and sometimes that is enough in practice.
http://andrzej.pownuk.com/IntervalEquations.htm
http://andrzej.pownuk.com/fuzzyPDE.htm

In some cases you can also get good results with guaranteed accuracy using
interval methods (for example using constraint satisfaction approach or some
kind of validated Taylor methods). However if the t is very large the
results may be overestimated then we will get a lot of solutions which do
not correspond to any parametric solution y(t,h) and because of that do not
have any physical interpretation (in such cases the solution is almost
meaningless). 
If the approximation of the interval solution is good then there are no such
problems even if the interval solution belong to very large interval (i.e.
even very wide interval solution may have very clear meaning and physical
interpretation).
