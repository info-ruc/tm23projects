   You can branch to the end of the item file when in the middle or include 
a last frame switch (L) in any item and DMDX will stop the job.  There is 
no way to save the data and continue unless you break the item file into 
two files and use <chain> at the end of the first one to chain to the 
second one.

You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you could
know how seldom they do.
