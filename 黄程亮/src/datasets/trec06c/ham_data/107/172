In the forward error sense, the interval at t_end could be large, if
the duration of the integration is many Lyapunov times (assuming a
small excess).  The Lyapunov time is the inverse of the Lyapunov
exponent, and essentially measures the time it takes for the distance
between two nearby solutions to increase by a factor of Euler's
constant.

However, there is a form of backward error analyis called "shadowing"
that is sometimes (not always) applicable.  A "shadow" of a numerical
solution is an exact solution remaining close to the numerical solution
for a long time.  In particular, if the initial value ODE is

    y'(t) = f(y), y(t0) = y0,

and the numerical solution is s(t), t0 <= t <= t1, then a shadow x(t)
is a solution satisfying

    x'(t) = f(x), x(t0) = x0,

such that 

    || x(t) - y(t) || < epsilon

for all t0 <= t <= t1, for some t1 > t0.  If |t1 - t0| is "long"
(with a problem- and user-dependent defiinition of what is "long"),
then the numerical solution s(t) is meaningful in that it can be
viewed as an "observation" of an exact solution, with epsilon being
the "observational error".  People such as experimental physicists
are very comfortable with this idea of observational error and thus
shadowing is applicable to some physical simulations.  Of course,
a numerical solution is typically a sequence of points rather than
a continuous curve s(t), but this restriction is easy to accomodate.
In some cases a shadow can be proven to exist in the validated interval
sense, although it is even more computationtally expensive than validated
ODE integration.  There also exist less rigorous but cheaper non-validated
shadowing algorithms.

You can find out more about shadowing, including a bunch of papers,
on my web page,

There are some (published) survey papers with many references therein.
