3.1: Several people grouped instructions 6 and 7 together and said they 
could be issued together. The question states that we're considering a 
dynamic pipeline without speculation, which means we cannot group together 
instructions across basic blocks. 6 doesn't necessarily fall through to 7 
since the compiler has freedom in picking the fall-through case between 
the then and else.

3.18:
   i) Clarification: My solution assumes a Tomasulo pipeline like Figure
      3.29 with a cycle delay for forwarding using the CDB. Notice that
      the question doesn't require it and doesn't specify a pipeline.
   ii) Erratum: The SD instructions shouldn't have the 'M' stage in the
      second, speculative case. Follow the example of figure 3.34.
   iii) Erratum: My solution for the second, speculative case omits a data
      dependence between Instruction 4 of iteration 1 and instruction 1 of
      iteration 2. Later portions of the schedule will have to be worked
      out after taking this into account.

5.3 b): The solution as handed out incorrectly reads the block size as 32
bytes; it should be 16 bytes if you assume the stride on the x axis to be
measured in bytes, or 64 bytes if you assume the stride to be measured in
words. The note in the solution is crucial to getting a correct reading.

Sorry about the confusion; feel free to contact me for further
clarification or regrading issues.
