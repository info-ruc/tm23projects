Dear Aaron Darling,
the Mauve program is a tour de force - fantastic resource. Thanks for the
update.  I was wondering whether there is any way to edit the input information
-  For example, I have been working with the S. aureus genomes, which contain
many copies of a ~60 nt repeat sequence known as STAR, and I would dearly love
to have MAUVE display these as elements in the alignments. Is there any way to
do this?
Thanks,
Richard Novick
