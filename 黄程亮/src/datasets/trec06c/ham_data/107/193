Hi everyone!

I have uploaded the next set of notes that we will probably start by Friday.  Remember...tomorrow we are going to try and nail down the dates for the group presentations so bring your calanders!  Also...2 groups have already made their topic choices, so I highly recommend everyone to communicate with their groups to try and come to a consensus on the topic (with Instructor approval, of course!).  See you tomorrow!
