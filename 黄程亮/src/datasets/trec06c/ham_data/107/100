Thank you for your suggestion. It runs properly, but I see some strange things
in .zil files like this: 

Subject 20, 10/13/2005 00:11:17 on BINHDKH, refresh 16.65ms
!  Display error at msec 140.44, tick 5 in item 0, frame "Press SPACEBAR to
start"
!    moved into video memory 4 ticks late
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)
!  Display error at msec 2637.95, tick 155 in item 100, frame "  "
!    moved into video memory 6 ticks late
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)
Item 100, -587.44

!  Display error at msec 15406.13, tick 922 in item 2, frame "clear2"

Item 1001, 241.92

Could you tell me how can I do to DMDX not print these line (after (! ) mark) to
the .zil file.

Kind regards,

VB Nguyen
