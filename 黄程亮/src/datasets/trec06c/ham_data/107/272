   The only time having a macro named 1 would screw things up was if you 
used the correct response short hand for <SkipDisplay> that's also a tilde 
(slight brain fade on my part there, sorry).  It would never screw up 
counter code except in a tangential fashion.  So you could wind up with:

~1 <set c1=c1+1>;

   The macro expansion code will expand ~1 and the code won't be what you 
intended.

   The bug stops here.
