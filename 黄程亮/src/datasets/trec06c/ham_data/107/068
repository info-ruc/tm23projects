   Yes.

   Yes.

   Read the help, it's available from the help button in DMDX's main dialog 
or online:

   Once for both output and input is sufficient.

   Yes, you'll want to unmap the current input mappings with <umb> and map 
new ones with <mpr> and <mnr>.  For instance <mpr +bit8>.
                                                /"\

   The bug stops here.
