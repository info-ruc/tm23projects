   You can keep the contents of the display from a previous item if the 
frames of each item have a no-erase in them, the ! switch.  To erase a 
given image you'll have to make a black (or whatever color the background 
is) and display it over the corresponding image.  You'll have to have three 
items that can take a response and you'll have to have a branch based on 
the response to one of three items that erases the specific image for that 
response.  If your images are the same size in the same locations then you 
can use subroutines for the erasing.  Something like this:

<zil> <zor> <xyjustification 1>

0 "start" <bu 100>;

1 ! <bmp> "black" <xy .25,.25> <return>;
2 ! <bmp> "black" <xy .75,.25> <return>;
3 ! <bmp> "black" <xy .5,.75> <return>;

+100 <bmp> "picture1" <xy .25,.25>, <bmp> "picture2" <xy .75,.25>,
         <bmp> "picture3" <xy .5,.75> * <mwc +1,1 +2,2, +3,3>;
+101 ! * <mwc +1,1 +2,2, +3,3>;
+102 ! * <mwc +1,1 +2,2, +3,3>;

   Of course this solution allows you to respond with any key at any time 
and doesn't guarantee that they won't press one response more than once and 
thus not have erased the whole screen afterwards.
