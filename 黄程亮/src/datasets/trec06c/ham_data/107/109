Dear J.C. Forster 

Again, question about i/o instructions.

How the lowest bit (the bit A0) is read by the plate Pio 12 (inputs).

 

A related question, if program DMDX reads the bit A0 from the card or if the bit A0 is assigned to other devices by default.

In that case if it is possible to change the reading of the lowest bit to be read by the Pio 12 card.


Thank you in advance

Assuming I'm understanding your English it's the same regardless of 
input device.
