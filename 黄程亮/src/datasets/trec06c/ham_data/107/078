Dear Sir,

I’m building an experiment with 3 pictures displayed and a text describes one of
these pictures. Participants have to response with 3 pressed key; with a key
pressed, the corresponding picture will disappear (i.e., press 1, the first
picture will disappear; press 2, the second will disappear; and so on). I can
use <zor> and <vzk> keywords to store responses to a .zil file but don’t know
how to:
1- Realising a key pressed in each item.
2- Clearing a picture when two others still on screen.

If know, please tell me. Thank you.

VB. Nguyen
