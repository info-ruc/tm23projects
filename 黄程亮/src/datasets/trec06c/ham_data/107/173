Here is a chance for those of you who chose not to purchase access to MyLabSchool to access the website for the first two bonus opportunities without having to pay. For those of you who paid, I'm sorry. I had no idea the company was going to do this, or I would have had you all wait and not purchase access. Here's what you need to do:

Between now and Oct. 21, go to www.mylabschool.com and log on as a student. On the home page, choose "courses", then "special Education", and you will find access to the video clips you need to view.

View each of the video clips required for the bonus activities, and then write your reactions on  your own word processor and save the files. You can submit the first one now, and then submit the second one at the appropriate time without having to go back onto MyLabSchool.

Here's the info from the publisher.

Dear Professor Herr,
  
Announcing a MyLabSchool Open House! < http://www.mylabschool.com >
  
>From October 10 - 21, MyLabSchool will have open-access for all students and professors. MyLabSchool is Allyn & Bacon Education's one-stop website for everything your students need to prepare for their first teaching job:
  
* Hours of video, in three to five minute clips and organized by topic, of real classrooms
* A tool for building standards-based lesson plans and professional portfolios
* PRAXIS prep and practice tests
* Over one hundred classroom-tested, standards-based lesson plans
* A source for help in preparing for the job interview process, including help creating a resume
* And lots, lots more!
  
The site, < http://mylabschool > is temporarily open to give your students an opportunity to explore all the great features the site has to offer. I invite you to pass this news along to your students, and ask them if MyLabSchool access would be valuable to them.
