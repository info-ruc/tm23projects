I'd like to output the values of some counters every time I output an
RT response.
What I get with <emit 4> <emit 5> is:

  Item       RT
!  Counter 4 has value 1
!  Counter 5 has value 1
   301   5427.05
!  Counter 4 has value 1
!  Counter 5 has value 2
   302   1459.57
!  Counter 4 has value 0
!  Counter 5 has value 1
   303   2617.90
...

What I'd like to get is:
   301   5427.05  1  1
   302   1459.57  1  2
   303   2617.90  0  1
...

I couldn't find a switch or option that enables this. But maybe
there's some way to do it?
Thanks,
-Yuval.
