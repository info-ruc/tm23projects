Thanks for the update, Hervé.

  Speaking of the return, I would think it is not just in terms of
money -- of course, they want to make money :-)  I guess, they want to
have some assurance that the ratio cost/benefit worths it, and this is
not just something for a very small and specialized community (it will
have to be distributed with every C++ implementation) but
actually makes a difference with respect to robust programs and libraries
using hat technology.  So, any evidence that the proposed library is
very useful for a broader community -- for example with examples to
applications using it -- will be very helpful.

(That is the flip side of a volunteer project, people worry about the 
cost/benefit).
