Dear colleagues,

version 2.0 of the CoStLy C++-library for complex inclusion functions
has been released.

Most of the library functions have been redesigned to eliminate
overflow, underflow and cancellation in intermediate expressions.
This has improved the robustness of the library and the accuracy of the
computed range bounds for arguments with very large or very small
absolute values and for arguments close to singularities.

The following complex functions are included in CoStLy (see the CoStLy
documentation for details):

abs, arg, sqr, n-th power, sqrt, n-th root;
exp, ln, cos, sin, tan, cot, cosh, sinh, tanh, coth;
Acos, Asin, Atan, Acot, Acosh, Asinh, Atanh, Acoth.

All inclusion functions are implemented for computing optimal range
bounds in exact arithmetic. Using the IEEE 754 double format, for a test
suite of 1200 point and interval arguments, the observed accuracy of the
range bounds was 48 to 52 bits. (I'm not claiming that the accuracy is
always so high; for arguments sufficiently close to a singularity, the
computed range bounds are rigorous, but not necessarily accurate; if the
range exceeds maxreal, then the computation breaks down.)

CoStLy 2.0 is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License. It is available at the CoStLy website
