disorder,
anxiety.=20
Yet for a variety of reasons, the hopes and claims for brain imaging in
psychiatry have far outpaced the science, experts say.=20
After almost 30 years, researchers have not developed any standardized =
tool
for diagnosing or treating psychiatric disorders based on imaging =
studies.
Several promising lines of research are under way. But imaging =
technology
has not lived up to the hopes invested in it in the 1990's - labeled the
"Decade of the Brain" by the American Psychiatric Association - when =
many
scientists believed that brain scans would turn on the lights in what =
had
been a locked black box.=20
Now, with imaging studies being published at a rate of more than 500 a =
year,
and commercial imaging clinics opening in some parts of the country, =
some
experts say that the technology has been oversold as a psychiatric tool.
Other researchers remain optimistic, but they wonder what the data add =
up
to, and whether it is time for the field to rethink its approach and its
expectations.=20
"I have been waiting for my work in the lab to affect my job on the =
weekend,
when I practice as a child psychiatrist," said Dr. Jay Giedd, chief of =
brain
imaging in the child psychiatry branch at the National Institute of =
Mental
Health, who has done M.R.I. scans in children Monday through Friday for =
14
years. "It hasn't happened. In this field, every year you hear, 'Oh, =
it's
more complicated than we thought.' Well, you hear that for 10 years, and =
you
start to see a pattern."
Psychiatrists still consider imaging technologies like M.R.I., for =
magnetic
resonance imaging, and PET, for positron emission topography, to be =
crucial
research tools. And the scanning technologies are invaluable as a way to
detect physical problems like head trauma, seizure activity or tumors
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtop=
ics
/tumors/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-classifier> . Moreover, the experts =
point out,
progress in psychiatry is by its nature painstakingly slow, and decades =
of
groundwork typically precede any real advances.=20
But there is a growing sense that brain scan research is still years =
away
from providing psychiatry with anything like the kind of clear tests for
mental illness that were hoped for.=20
"I think that, with some notable exceptions, the community of scientists =
was
excessively optimistic about how quickly imaging would have an impact on
psychiatry," said Dr. Steven Hyman, a professor of neurobiology at =
Harvard
and the former director of the National Institute of Mental Health. "In
their enthusiasm, people forgot that the human brain is the most complex
object in the history of human inquiry, and it's not at all easy to see
what's going wrong."
For one thing, brains are as variable as personalities.=20
In a range of studies, researchers have found that people with =
schizophrenia
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtop=
ics
/schizophrenia/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-classifier>  suffer a progressive =
loss
of their brain cells: a 20-year-old who develops the disorder, for =
example,
might lose 5 percent to 10 percent of overall brain volume over the next
decade, studies suggest.=20
Ten percent is a lot, and losses of volume in the frontal lobes are
associated with measurable impairment in schizophrenia, psychiatrists =
have
found. But brain volume varies by at least 10 percent from person to =
person,
so volume scans of patients by themselves cannot tell who is sick, the
experts say.=20
Studies using brain scans to measure levels of brain activity often =
suffer
from the same problem: what looks like a "hot spot" of activity change =
in
one person's brain may be a normal change in someone else's.=20
"The differences observed are not in and of themselves outside the range =
of
variation seen in the normal population," said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman,
chairman of the psychiatry department at Columbia University Medical =
Center
and director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute.
To make matters even more complicated, many findings are disputed. In =
people
with severe depression, for instance, researchers have found apparent
shrinkage of a part of the temporal lobe called the hippocampus, which =
is
critical for memory. But other investigators have not been able to =
replicate
this finding, and people with injuries to the hippocampus typically =
suffer
amnesia, not depression, psychiatrists say.=20
For problems like attention-deficit disorder and bipolar disorder
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtop=
ics
/bipolardisorder/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-classifier> , the experts say,
psychiatrists have much less research on which to base their theories.
Most fundamentally, imaging research has not answered the underlying
question that the technology itself has raised: which comes first, the
disease or the apparent difference in brain structure or function that =
is
being observed?=20
For a definitive answer, researchers would need to follow thousands of
people from childhood through adulthood, taking brain scans regularly, =
and
matching them with scans from peers who did not develop a disorder, =
experts
say. Given the expense and difficulty, such a study may never be done, =
Dr.
Hyman said.=20
One investigator has used imaging research to fashion a small, =
experimental
psychiatric treatment.=20
In a series of studies of people with severe depression, Dr. Helen =
Mayberg,
a professor of psychiatry at Emory University in Atlanta, found a =
baffling
pattern of activity.=20
Using PET scanning technology, Dr. Mayberg found sharp dips and spikes =
of
activity in about a half-dozen areas of these patients' brains as their
moods improved while they were taking either antidepressant drugs or
placebos.=20
The changes were similar in all patients, but it was difficult to tell =
how
the scattering of the dips and spikes were related.
By analyzing the peaks and valleys on the scans as part of a circuit -
networked together, like a string of Christmas lights - Dr. Mayberg =
found
that one spot in particular seemed to modulate the entire system, like a
transformer or a dimmer.=20
She confirmed the importance of this spot, called Brodmann area 25, by
scanning the brains of mentally healthy people while they remembered =
painful
episodes from their lives: while sad they, too, showed increased =
activity in
this area.=20
In March, Dr. Mayberg and a team based at the Rotman Research Institute =
in
Toronto reported on six patients who had had electrodes implanted in =
their
brains next to Brodmann area 25.=20
All had been severely depressed for at least a year, and they had =
responded
poorly to available therapies. The implanted electrodes, often used to =
treat
Parkinson's
<http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtop=
ics
/parkinsonsdisease/index.html?inline=3Dnyt-classifier>  disease, produce =
a
current that slows neural activity, for reasons scientists do not yet
understand.=20
So far, the researchers reported in the journal Neuron, four of the six
people have shown significant and lasting recovery; all four are still =
on
antidepressant drugs but at reduced doses. And all four have returned to
work or their usual routines, Dr. Mayberg said.=20
The widely reported experiment has generated more than 300 requests from
people to be considered for the operation, she added.=20
"It's very important to understand that this is experimental, and the =
next
step is to replicate what we did, with a placebo, and that could send us
right back to the drawing board," Dr. Mayberg said in an interview.
The findings so far are encouraging, she said, "but the idea that this =
is
something for every severely depressed patient - well, shame on us if we
suggest that. The brain is a very big place and we had better have a =
very
good idea of what we're doing before holding this out as a treatment."=20
Many people would rather not wait for the science of imaging to mature,
however. At clinics in California, Washington, Illinois, Texas and
elsewhere, doctors offer brain scans to people with a variety of =
conditions,
from attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, often called A.D.H.D., to
depression and aggressive behavior.=20
Dr. Daniel Amen, an adult and child psychiatrist based in Newport Beach,
Calif., said he performed 28,000 scans on adults and children over the =
past
14 years, using a technique called Spect, or single photon emission =
computed
tomography.=20
In an interview, Dr. Amen said that it was unconscionable that the
profession of psychiatry was not making more use of brain scans. "Here =
we
are, giving five or six different medications to children without even
looking at the organ we're changing," he said.=20
He said the scans had helped him to distinguish between children with
attention deficit problems who respond well to stimulants like Ritalin =
and
those who do poorly on the drugs. In a series of books and medical =
articles,
Dr. Amen argued that the images helped convince people that the behavior
problems had a biological basis and needed treatment, with drugs or =
other
therapies.=20
"They increase compliance with treatment and decrease the shame and =
guilt"
associated with the disorders, he said.=20
At the Brainwaves Neuroimaging Clinic in Houston, doctors use the scans =
to
diagnose and choose treatment for a range of psychiatric problems, =
according
to a clinic spokeswoman. And a variety of doctors advertise the imaging
services, particularly for attention-deficit disorder, on the Internet. =
But
the experts who study imaging and psychiatry say there is no evidence =
that a
brain scan, which can cost more than $1,000, adds significantly to =
standard
individual psychiatric exams.=20
"The thing for people to understand is that right now, the only thing
imaging can tell you is whether you have a brain tumor," or some other
neurological damage, said Paul Root Wolpe, a professor of psychiatry and
sociology at the University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics.
He added, "This imaging technology is so far from prime time that to =
spend
thousands of dollars on it doesn't make any sense."=20
The big payoff from imaging technology, some experts say, may come as
researchers combine the scans with other techniques, like genetic or
biochemical tests. By radioactively marking specific receptors in the =
brain,
for example, researchers are using brain scans to measure how brain
chemicals known to affect mood, like dopamine, behave in people with
schizophrenia, compared with mentally healthy peers.=20
Imaging researchers are also studying depression-related circuits to see =
how
they may arise from genetic variations known to put people at risk for
depression.=20
And as always, the technology itself is improving: a new generation of
M.R.I. scanners, with double the resolution power of the current =
machines,
is becoming more widely available, Dr. Lieberman said.=20
"With increased resolution, we'll be able to do more sensitive and more
precise work, and I would not be surprised if anatomy alone based on =
volume
will be a diagnostic feature," he said. "We have gained an enormous =
amount
knowledge from thousands of imaging studies, we are on the threshold of
applying that knowledge, and now it's a matter of getting over the
threshold."
But for now, neither he nor anyone else can say when that will happen.=20

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Yet for a variety of reasons, the =
hopes and claims for brain imaging in psychiatry have far outpaced the =
science, experts say. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">After almost 30 years, researchers =
have not developed any standardized tool for diagnosing or treating =
psychiatric disorders based on imaging studies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Several promising lines of research =
are under way. But imaging technology has not lived up to the hopes =
invested in it in the 1990's - labeled the &quot;Decade of the =
Brain&quot; by the American Psychiatric Association - when many =
scientists believed that brain scans would turn on the lights in what =
had been a locked black box. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Now, with imaging studies being =
published at a rate of more than 500 a year, and commercial imaging =
clinics opening in some parts of the country, some experts say that the =
technology has been oversold as a psychiatric tool. Other researchers =
remain optimistic, but they wonder what the data add up to, and whether =
it is time for the field to rethink its approach and its expectations. =
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">&quot;I have been waiting for my work =
in the lab to affect my job on the weekend, when I practice as a child =
psychiatrist,&quot; said Dr. Jay Giedd, chief of brain imaging in the =

has done M.R.I. scans in children Monday through Friday for 14 years. =
&quot;It hasn't happened. In this field, every year you hear, 'Oh, it's =
more complicated than we thought.' Well, you hear that for 10 years, and =
you start to see a pattern.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Psychiatrists still consider imaging =
technologies like M.R.I., for magnetic resonance imaging, and PET, for =
positron emission topography, to be crucial research tools. And the =
scanning technologies are invaluable as a way to detect physical =

FACE=3D"Times New Roman">. Moreover, the experts point out, progress in =
psychiatry is by its nature painstakingly slow, and decades of =
groundwork typically precede any real advances. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">But there is a growing sense that =
brain scan research is still years away from providing psychiatry with =
anything like the kind of clear tests for mental illness that were hoped =
for. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">&quot;I think that, with some notable =
exceptions, the community of scientists was excessively optimistic about =
how quickly imaging would have an impact on psychiatry,&quot; said Dr. =
Steven Hyman, a professor of neurobiology at Harvard and the former =
director of the National Institute of Mental Health. &quot;In their =
enthusiasm, people forgot that the human brain is the most complex =
object in the history of human inquiry, and it's not at all easy to see =
what's going wrong.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">For one thing, brains are as variable =
as personalities. </FONT>

have found that people with </FONT><A =

suffer a progressive loss of their brain cells: a 20-year-old who =
develops the disorder, for example, might lose 5 percent to 10 percent =
of overall brain volume over the next decade, studies suggest. =
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Ten percent is a lot, and losses of =
volume in the frontal lobes are associated with measurable impairment in =
schizophrenia, psychiatrists have found. But brain volume varies by at =
least 10 percent from person to person, so volume scans of patients by =
themselves cannot tell who is sick, the experts say. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Studies using brain scans to measure =
levels of brain activity often suffer from the same problem: what looks =
like a &quot;hot spot&quot; of activity change in one person's brain may =
be a normal change in someone else's. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">&quot;The differences observed are not =
in and of themselves outside the range of variation seen in the normal =
population,&quot; said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, chairman of the psychiatry =
department at Columbia University Medical Center and director of the New =
York State Psychiatric Institute.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">To make matters even more complicated, =
many findings are disputed. In people with severe depression, for =
instance, researchers have found apparent shrinkage of a part of the =
temporal lobe called the hippocampus, which is critical for memory. But =

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Most fundamentally, imaging research =
has not answered the underlying question that the technology itself has =
raised: which comes first, the disease or the apparent difference in =
brain structure or function that is being observed? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">For a definitive answer, researchers =
would need to follow thousands of people from childhood through =
adulthood, taking brain scans regularly, and matching them with scans =
from peers who did not develop a disorder, experts say. Given the =
expense and difficulty, such a study may never be done, Dr. Hyman said. =
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">One investigator has used imaging =
research to fashion a small, experimental psychiatric treatment. </FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">In a series of studies of people with =
severe depression, Dr. Helen Mayberg, a professor of psychiatry at Emory =
University in Atlanta, found a baffling pattern of activity. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Using PET scanning technology, Dr. =
Mayberg found sharp dips and spikes of activity in about a half-dozen =
areas of these patients' brains as their moods improved while they were =
taking either antidepressant drugs or placebos. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">The changes were similar in all =
patients, but it was difficult to tell how the scattering of the dips =
and spikes were related.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">By analyzing the peaks and valleys on =
the scans as part of a circuit - networked together, like a string of =
Christmas lights - Dr. Mayberg found that one spot in particular seemed =
to modulate the entire system, like a transformer or a dimmer. =
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">She confirmed the importance of this =
spot, called Brodmann area 25, by scanning the brains of mentally =
healthy people while they remembered painful episodes from their lives: =
while sad they, too, showed increased activity in this area. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">In March, Dr. Mayberg and a team based =
at the Rotman Research Institute in Toronto reported on six patients who =
had had electrodes implanted in their brains next to Brodmann area 25. =

scientists do not yet understand. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">So far, the researchers reported in =
the journal Neuron, four of the six people have shown significant and =
lasting recovery; all four are still on antidepressant drugs but at =
reduced doses. And all four have returned to work or their usual =
routines, Dr. Mayberg said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">The widely reported experiment has =
generated more than 300 requests from people to be considered for the =
operation, she added. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">&quot;It's very important to =
understand that this is experimental, and the next step is to replicate =
what we did, with a placebo, and that could send us right back to the =
drawing board,&quot; Dr. Mayberg said in an interview.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">The findings so far are encouraging, =
she said, &quot;but the idea that this is something for every severely =
depressed patient - well, shame on us if we suggest that. The brain is a =
very big place and we had better have a very good idea of what we're =
doing before holding this out as a treatment.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Many people would rather not wait for =
the science of imaging to mature, however. At clinics in California, =
Washington, Illinois, Texas and elsewhere, doctors offer brain scans to =
people with a variety of conditions, from attention-deficit =
hyperactivity disorder, often called A.D.H.D., to depression and =
aggressive behavior. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Dr. Daniel Amen, an adult and child =
psychiatrist based in Newport Beach, Calif., said he performed 28,000 =
scans on adults and children over the past 14 years, using a technique =
called Spect, or single photon emission computed tomography. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">In an interview, Dr. Amen said that it =
was unconscionable that the profession of psychiatry was not making more =
use of brain scans. &quot;Here we are, giving five or six different =
medications to children without even looking at the organ we're =
changing,&quot; he said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">He said the scans had helped him to =
distinguish between children with attention deficit problems who respond =
well to stimulants like Ritalin and those who do poorly on the drugs. In =
a series of books and medical articles, Dr. Amen argued that the images =
helped convince people that the behavior problems had a biological basis =
and needed treatment, with drugs or other therapies. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">&quot;They increase compliance with =
treatment and decrease the shame and guilt&quot; associated with the =
disorders, he said. </FONT>

<BR><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">At the Brainwaves Neuroimaging Clinic =
in Houston, doctors use the scans to diagnose and choose treatment for a =
range of psychiatric problems, according to a clinic spokeswoman. And a =
variety of doctors advertise the imaging services, particularly for =
attention-deficit disorder, on the Internet. But the experts who study =
imaging and psychiatry say there is no evidence that a brain scan, which =
can cost more than $1,000, adds significantly to standard individual =
psychiatric exams. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">&quot;The thing for people to =
understand is that right now, the only thing imaging can tell you is =
whether you have a brain tumor,&quot; or some other neurological damage, =
said Paul Root Wolpe, a professor of psychiatry and sociology at the =
University of Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">He added, &quot;This imaging =
technology is so far from prime time that to spend thousands of dollars =
on it doesn't make any sense.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">The big payoff from imaging =
technology, some experts say, may come as researchers combine the scans =
with other techniques, like genetic or biochemical tests. By =
radioactively marking specific receptors in the brain, for example, =
researchers are using brain scans to measure how brain chemicals known =
to affect mood, like dopamine, behave in people with schizophrenia, =
compared with mentally healthy peers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">Imaging researchers are also studying =
depression-related circuits to see how they may arise from genetic =
variations known to put people at risk for depression. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">And as always, the technology itself =
is improving: a new generation of M.R.I. scanners, with double the =
resolution power of the current machines, is becoming more widely =
available, Dr. Lieberman said. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">&quot;With increased resolution, we'll =
be able to do more sensitive and more precise work, and I would not be =
surprised if anatomy alone based on volume will be a diagnostic =
feature,&quot; he said. &quot;We have gained an enormous amount =
knowledge from thousands of imaging studies, we are on the threshold of =
applying that knowledge, and now it's a matter of getting over the =
threshold.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE=3D"Times New Roman">But for now, neither he nor anyone =
else can say when that will happen. </FONT>
