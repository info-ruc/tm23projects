   No, there's no way to do it.  There's <zol> to make zillion data all on 
one line however it does nothing to counter output.  You would have to want 
to sponsor it's addition as it would be messy to add.

                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X

   The bug stops here.
