Dear DMDX-mates,

In the La Laguna University (ULL), we have been working with DMDX for some 
time, but we noticed some errors depending on the .rtf files we use.
The version we use is 3.1.2.6 and once we want to run an experiment written 
down in a .rtf file, an error display appears telling us about the 
configuration of the screen (CRTs), and an strange request done to use 
600x400… that we never asked for.
Our experiments run properly in a 85Hz display, without any video mode 
written in the parameters lines, with the correct configuration on TimeDX, 
but in other displays and computers, they don’t run.
What should we do for making them run?
Thank you for your helpful work.

Jon Andoni
