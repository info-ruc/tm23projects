DEAR J.C. FORSTER
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS
 
I' VE ANOTHER QUESTION ABOUT I/O INSTRUCTIONS.
 
WHEN <ID KEYBOARD> IS WRITTEN IN THE PARAMETER LINE:
I UNDERSTOOD THAT WITH DE "+" SIGN A RESPONSE KEY IS HABILITATED, AND WHEN THE "*" SIGN CONTINUED BY A FRAME IS RESPONDEN THROUGH DE KEYBOARD, THE RESPONSE AND RESPONSE TIME IS READ BY DMDX.
 
WHEN <ID "PIO12"> IS WRITTEN IN THE PARAMETER LINE:
WHICH INSTRUCTION OR KEYBOARD IS NECESSARY IN THE ITEM LINE FOR THE SAME?
 
WITH REGARDS,
DR. ALBERTO YORIO

Yes.

Yes.

Read the help, it's available from the help button in DMDX's main dialog 
or online:

Once for both output and input is sufficient.

Yes, you'll want to unmap the current input mappings with and map 
new ones with and . For instance .
