   Really old versions of DMDX could ask for the default 640x480 video mode 
before the video mode that the item file asked for was used but we're 
talking about versions prior to 3.  If an item file doesn't contain a <vm> 
keyword it will be using 640x480.

   Use a specific <vm> that asks for an 85 Hz display.  There are about a 
dozen things that can change what a generic display's (one that is listed 
as 0 Hz) frequency is and only a couple that can muck up a specific request 
to use a given frequency so I recommend using a <vm> that asks for a 
specific frequency.

   The bug stops here.
