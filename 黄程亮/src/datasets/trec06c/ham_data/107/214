There is an implementation (I am afraid it it may be in C) of a similar
formalism - affine arithmetic; the reference is in

tml 

You get there by clicking on Generalizations of Interval Arithmetic and
their Applications link in the interval computations website

Dear All,
is there any C++ or Fortran implementation of a Generalized Interval
Arithmetic?.
Reference:
Hansen, E. R. :  a Generalized Interval Arithmetic, in Nickel, K. L.
(ed.), Interval Mathematics, vol. 29 of lecture notes in computer
science, Springer-Verlage, Berlin, 1975.

Thanks!.
