Of course, Gaby is right. The fact that we presented a proposal to the
ISO C++ Committee and that the proposal wasn't outright rejected, does
not mean it is accepted. In any case, it is not targeted at C++0x, but
only at the Technical Report TR2 (if you don't understand these
subtleties, don't worry). There will be more revisions and presentations
to the committe before we know either way.

What can be said for now, is that besides the technical issues (which
appear to be not too hard to resolve) the main obstacle seems to
establish a broad user base of customers.  In a nutshell, C++ library
vendors want to know that their efforts will be rewarded (commercially
speaking), and this is their entire right. They are committed to
providing an implementation of the C++ standard, it is costly for them
(esp. the transcendental math functions on intervals), so they want to
see a potential return before they would approve.

Hence my message to the community is: please communicate to us (me,
S.Pion or G. Melquiond) any project or organization that would be willing to state publicly that it would make a difference to have intervals in the C++ standard. We've already had some feedback in that sense, but need more to establish a strong case.

Thank you,
