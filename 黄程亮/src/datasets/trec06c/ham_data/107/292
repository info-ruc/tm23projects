The President of the World Bank recently announced that the Bank was going
to stress agricultural projects.   I assume this especially applies to
Africa, given the Bank's earlier pronouncements.

 

I applaud this announcement, but have several reservations.

 

-Does the World Bank have any significant number of employees with
agricultural science degrees and/or experience in developing successful
agricultural projects, especially in Africa?     Thirty years ago there were
quite a few aggies in the Bank but most of them have died or retired.  Are
there many young staff who know the difference between a steer and a bull,
acidic and basic soils, or triticum and hordeum vulgare?

 

-The Bank can point to few successful agricultural development projects in
Africa the past several decades.  I suspect the success list of the African
Development Bank projects in agriculture is even shorter.  Where does the
Bank start again without staff or successful experiences?  (See George
Ayittey's book <<Africa Unchained>> for yards and yards of bad experiences
in Africa.)  Most countries in Africa are worse off now than they were
before donors started to help them 40 years ago.

 

-Until the Bank mostly bailed out of agriculture in the late 1980s, a large
lump of its "assistance" to agriculture was in the form of agricultural
credit.  I doubt if any knowledgeable person would claim this "assistance"
helped many financial systems, farmers, or the rural poor.  I don't know of
a single Bank funded agricultural credit project in Africa that I'd call a
success. Is the Bank going to be creative enough to do agriculture without
again pulling up to the central banks or development banks with truck loads
of agricultural credit that later flows into Swiss banks?

 

It will be interesting to see what, if anything, the Bank can make out of
all this......jane
