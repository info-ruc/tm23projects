Overview

   Various Oracle products and components are affected by multiple
   vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include
   unauthenticated, remote code execution, information disclosure, and
   denial of service.


I. Description

   Oracle released a Critical Patch Update in October 2005. It addresses
   more than eighty vulnerabilities in different Oracle products and
   components.

   The Critical Patch Update provides information about affected
   components, access and authorization required, and the impact of the
   vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   For more information on terms used in the Critical Patch Update,
   Metalink customers should refer to MetaLink Note 293956.1.

   According to the Critical Patch Update: "The new database
   vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update do not affect
   Oracle Database Client-only installations (installations that do not
   have the Oracle Database Server installed). Therefore, it is not
   necessary to apply this Critical Patch Update to client-only
   installations if a prior Critical Patch Update, or Alert 68, has
   already been applied to the client-only installations."

   US-CERT recommends that sites running Oracle review the Critical Patch
   Update, apply patches, and take other mitigating action as
   appropriate. US-CERT is tracking all of these issues under VU#210524.
   As further information becomes available, we will publish individual
   Vulnerability Notes.

   Note that according to public reports, the patches included in this
   update, as well as previous updates, may not adequately correct all
   security vulnerabilities.


II. Impact

   The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product,
   component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences
   include remote execution of arbitrary code or commands, information
   disclosure, and denial of service. An attacker who compromises an
   Oracle database may be able to gain access to sensitive information.


III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle
   Critical Patch Update - October 2005. Note that this Critical Patch
   Update only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for
   previously known issues are not listed.

Workarounds

   It may be possible to mitigate some vulnerabilities by disabling or
   removing unnecessary components, restricting network access, and
   restricting access to temporary files.

   Oracle Critical Patch Update - October 2005 suggests disabling the
   PSQL Manager to mitigate a vulnerability in PeopleSoft Enterprise
   PeopleTools (PSE04).
