   Yeah, the time for the next frame is calculated from when the previous 
display ended so a timeout that's longer than the display will screw up the 
timing.  A 500ms frame plus a 500ms delay minus a two second response 
timeout gives you around 60 ticks.

   Could be a version thing, I just recently fixed the way <cr> was working 
with <d> and your machines may have different version of DMDX on 
them.  Prior to 3.1.4.1 a pretty un-rigorous piece of code would have not 
had display errors when the subject's response went over the display 
duration when <cr> and <d> were used together.  As long as the display was 
longer than the RT things will have been fine (as long as you didn't have a 
really fast CPU) but for poorly formed items like you have there it will 
have been scheduling the display from the time that the previous item 
finished, not it's display.

You probably wouldn't worry about what people think of you if you could
know how seldom they do.
