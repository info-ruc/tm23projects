Subject: Mauve 1.2.3 released

   After a long hiatus we are happy to announce the release of Mauve 
version 1.2.3 (code name CandyLand). As usual, the new release has many 
enhancements and bug fixes over previous releases. Many enhancements 
are the direct result of user suggestions and feedback. Most notably, 
Mauve now displays multi-part genes and annotated repeat regions. Also, 
the LCB display mode (used when 'Full Alignment' is disabled) has been 
fixed. By disabling the 'Full Alignment' option when computing an 
alignment, it is possible to quickly get a picture of genomic 
rearrangement structure and to determine the appropriate LCB weight for 
a subsequent Full Alignment.

 Thank you all for your support, feedback, and bug reports.
 The full ChangeLog entry follows...

 -Aaron


 ------------

 Version 1.2.3 (2005-10-20)

 New features:

  - Display each component of multi-part features (e.g. a multiple exon 
gene) as a linked series of boxes

 - Display repeat_region annotations from GenBank files

  - Improved load time for previously viewed alignments using a 
disk-based alignment cache

 - Added a help menu item that will clear the on-disk alignment cache

  - Colorized the similarity plots, grey was starting to depress our 
entire lab.

  - Support for highlighting arbitrary regions of the sequence by 
holding the shift key while clicking and dragging on the display

 - Faster nucleotide display when zoomed in closely

 Bug fixes:

  - Fixed GUI interface for setting the minimum seed size (Thanks to 
Bill Bruno and Todd Treangen)

  - Fixed mouseover, highlighting, and display alignment in the LCB 
display mode (used when the 'Full Alignment' option is disabled)
