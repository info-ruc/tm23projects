> Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Proteins"
>
> Talk Abstract:
> Some of the most important outstanding questions in the
> fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine remain unsolved
> as a result of our limited understanding of the structure,
> behavior and interaction of biologically significant molecules.
> The underlying laws of physics that determine the form
> and function of these biomolecules are relatively well understood.
> Current technology, however, does not allow us to simulate
> the effect of these laws with sufficient accuracy, and for
> a sufficient period of time, to answer many of the questions
> that biologists, biochemists, and biomedical researchers
> are most anxious to answer.  This talk will summarize the
> current state of the art in biomolecular modeling based
> on all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicitly
> modeled solvent, and will describe efforts within our own
> lab to develop novel algorithms and machine architectures
> to accelerate such simulations by several orders of magnitude.
> To the extent these efforts prove successful, we hope to
> make it possible for the first time for researchers to perform
> millisecond-scale simulations of such phenomena as the process
> of protein folding, the binding of proteins to pharmaceutical
> compounds and endogenous ligands, the interaction of proteins
> with other proteins and with nucleic acids, the mechanisms
> of allosteric activation and inhibition, and perhaps the
> operation of certain simple intracellular machines.

> Speaker Bio:
> David Shaw serves as chief scientist of D. E. Shaw Research
> and as a senior research fellow at the Center for Computational
> Biology and Bioinformatics at Columbia University.  He currently
> leads an interdisciplinary research lab consisting of 35
> computational chemists and biologists, computer scientists
> and applied mathematicians, and computer architects and
> engineers whose principal focus is the development of novel
> physical models, computational algorithms and machine architectures
> for biomolecular simulation, protein structure determination,
> and computational drug design.  After receiving his Ph.D.
> from Stanford University in 1980, Dr. Shaw joined the faculty
> of the Computer Science Department at Columbia University.
>  In 1988, he founded the D. E. Shaw group of companies,
> an $18 billion investment and technology development firm,
> and led the firm until 2002, when he returned to hands-on
> scientific research.  In 1994, Dr. Shaw was appointed by
> President Clinton to the President’s Committee of Advisors
> on Science and Technology.  He currently serves on the board
> of directors of the American Association for the Advancement
> of Science, and is a member of the external advisory group
> of the Sloan-Kettering Institute.
