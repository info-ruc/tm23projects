A colleague at the IRC asked if I might post this to
some networks in economic development.  Please
circulate as you see fit.  The IRC is a great
organization, and I am always impressed by the caliber
of their staff when I have collaborated with them in
the past.=20

The position is a result of a recent reorganization
within the IRC=97its my understanding that they
increasing recognize the need to lay the basis for
economic development as quickly as possible in the
relief and rehabilitation environments in which they
work.

 I think it=92s a lesson that has hit home recently in
regards to Aceh and some other environments in which
many of us are now working.

Contact information at the IRC with questions for the
announcement is included below.
