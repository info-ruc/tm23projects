reliable_computing subscribers et al,

We encountered these issues when proposing an interval data type
for Fortran.  Actually, it was always somewhat controversial
in the committee, but for some time a majority of J3 (the Fortran
standardization committee) supported an interval data type in
Fortran.  That is, we had convinced a majority of the committee
that the benefits would go beyond a small and specialized community,
and we had worked on the standard for over a year, producing
various documents.
I strongly believe that we can make that argument even more
strongly (and truthfully) now than when intervals were in front of J3.

What finally killed the interval data type in J3 was a lack of
consensus ON OUR PART concerning certain technical issues.  Thus,
let's not minimize the technical issues;  this lack of consensus
changed the vote in J3.  However, I believe that
we now understand the technical issues better than when Fortran
was in front of J3.

Sincerely,

Baker

P.S. I see a chance that use of intervals will outlast
     Fortran (although I don't think Fortran 95 is a bad language
     per se' for scientific programming).
