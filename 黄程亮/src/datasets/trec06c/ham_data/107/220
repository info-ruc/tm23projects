I hope Hervé and Sylvain will post a report of the last C++ committee
meeting to this list (I wasn't in the library room when it was
discussed).  There is no rule for automatic lifting of Boost libraries
into C++0x.  However, the interval component proposal was discussed
and I believe some issues would need to be addressed before the C++
committee considered it for vote into C++0x.
