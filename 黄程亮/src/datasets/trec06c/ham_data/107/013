> ABSTRACT:
>
> For decades, computer benchmarkers have fought a War of Means, arguing  
> over
> proper uses of Arithmetic, Harmonic, and Geometric Means, starting in  
> the
> mid-1980s. One would think this basic issue of computer performance  
> analysis
> would have been long resolved, but contradictions are still present in  
> some
> excellent and widely-used textbooks.
>
> This talk offers a framework that resolves these issues and includes  
> both
> workload analyses and relative performance analyses (such as SPEC or  
> Livermore
> Loops), emphasizing differences between algebraic and statistical  
> approaches.
> In some cases, the lognormal distribution is found to be quite useful,
> especially with appropriate forms of standard deviation and confidence  
> interval
> used to augment the usual Geometric Mean. Results can be used to  
> indicate the
> relative importance of careful workload analysis.
>
> BIOGRAPHY:
>
> Dr. John R. Mashey is a consultant for venture capitalists and  
> technology
> companies, but has been involved off-and-on in computer performance  
> analysis
> for 35 years.  He is "an ancient UNIX person," having started work on  
> it at
> Bell Labs in 1973, and continuing to work there for 10 years,  
> including design
> of the UNIX per-process accounting software.  He moved to Silicon  
> Valley in
> 1983 to join Convergent Technologies, ending as director of software.  
> Mashey
> joined MIPS Computer Systems in early 1985, managing operating systems
> development, and helping design the MIPS RISC architecture, as well as  
> specific
> CPUs, systems and software. He continued similar work at SGI (1992 -  
> 2000) most
> recently contributing to the design of SGI's NUMAflex modular computer
> architecture, ending as VP and Chief Scientist.
>
> Mashey was one of the founders of the SPEC benchmarking group, was an  
> ACM
> National Lecturer for four years, has been guest editor for IEEE  
> Micro, and
> one of the long-time organizers of the Hot Chips conferences.  
> Additionally, he
> has chaired technical conferences on operating systems and CPU chips,  
> and has
> given more than 500 public talks on software engineering, RISC design,
> performance benchmarking and supercomputing. He is a Trustee of the  
> Computer
> History Museum.
>
> He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Pennsylvania State  
> University.
