I'm not sure exactly what you are asking.  Are you asking about how to
compare the quality of two interval solvers?  If so, comparing the width of
the interval y(tend) is one measure.  A more comprehensive measure would be
some norm of width of the interval y(t) for t in [0, tend].  You could also
compare the widths of the defects y'(t) - f(t,y).

If you do any of those, you should be careful of concluding too much.  You
will only have compared the tightness performance of the two methods on that
problem.  The tightness performance on another problem might be quite
different.

If what you want is an evaluation of the quality of a single interval
solver, you probably want some measure of the EXCESS width, although
authorities differ on the most appropriate way to express excess width,
especially in dimensions greater than one.
