Call for Papers

2006 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~grc/ GSU, Atlanta, USA, May 10-12, 2006 Sponsored by The IEEE Computational Intelligence Society.

Granular Computing (GrC) is a general computation theory for effectively using granules such as classes, clusters, subsets, groups and intervals to build an efficient computational model for complex applications with huge amounts of data, information and knowledge. Though the label is relatively recent, the basic notions and principles of granular computing, though under different names, have appeared in many related fields, such as information hiding in programming, granularity in artificial intelligence, divide and conquer in theoretical computer science, interval computing, cluster analysis, fuzzy and rough set theories, neutrosophic computing, quotient space theory, belief functions, machine learning, databases, and many others. In the past few years, we have witnessed a renewed and fast growing interest in GrC. Granular computing has begun to play important roles in bioinformatics, e-Business, security, machine learning, data mining, high-performance computing and wireless mobile computing in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, robustness and uncertainty.

2006 IEEE International Conference on Granular Computing (IEEE-GrC2006,
http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/~grc) to be held at Georgia State University in Atlanta, following the great success of IEEE-GrC2005 (Beijing, July 25-27, 2005), will continue to bring together researchers from universities, laboratories and industry to present state-of-the-art research results and methodologies in theory and applications of granular computing:
   -   theory and methodologies of granular computing, including rough sets
as a special form for granulation;
   -   applications in data mining, soft computing, bioinformatics,
e-Intelligence, security, distributed computing, etc.

Major research tracks include:
   -   Computational Intelligence (Neural Networks, Fuzzy Systems,
Evolutionary Computation, Rough Sets, etc.)
   -   Foundation of Data Mining and Learning (Probabilistic/Statistical
Learning, Machine Learning, Kernel Machines, etc .)

Relevant application tracks include, but are not limited to:
   -   Bioinformatics, medical informatics and chemical informatics
   -   E-Intelligence, Web informatics, Web intelligence, Web mining and
Semantic Web
   -   High-performance computing, grid computing, wireless mobile
computing and sensor networks
   -   Security

Important Dates:
   Submission Deadline: Dec. 15, 2005 (extended from Nov. 20, 2005)
   Acceptance Notification: Jan. 15, 2006
   Camera-Ready: Jan. 30, 2006
   Conference: May 10-12, 2006
