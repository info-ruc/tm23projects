Hi all,

I have a DMDX script of a gambling task in which I'd like to keep track 
of how much money the subject is winning and losing on a trial by trial 
basis.  The money will be going up and down by only a few cents at a 
time, so I need an idea that can handle decimals (which seems to leave 
out the Counter var, as far as I can tell). 

Some other possible relevent information is that the trials are 
hardwired to be wins or losses, so I know upfront on each trial whether 
the earnings will be incremented or decremented.  However, I intend to 
periodically show each subject how much they have earned so far, which 
may be different for each subject because I will be scrambling the file. 

If anyone has done something like this in the past, or can point me to 
an appropriate keyword/variable to use, I'd greatly appreciate your help 
and advice!

Thanks,
Nicole
