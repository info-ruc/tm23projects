(1) is it possible that you mixed up some numbers? You are talking
about sending a file of 700 GB ... quite a story.

(2) if you've tried send a mail with your document inserted into it,
the sendmail agent fails (I hope, I haven't mixed up things here). 

So, here we go ... provided, the file is less than, let's say, 2 MB
which I regard of as a reasonable size to send via email (use ftp in
other cases or split the file), try to attach the file, that is Ctrl-J
while you are in the header region. This converts the binary data into
ASCII and sendmail (or whatever) won't complain about it.

hth, norbert.
