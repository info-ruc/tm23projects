Do it very quietly.

Re closing the list to subscribers only:  I'm probably wrong and
too tired to think straight anyhow, but just a sec - I thought
that one of the main reasons we have such a problem with
off-topic posts on the mailing list is that the pine newsgroup
gateways posts to list.  Is that right?  I probably explained it
wrong, but basically I thought there was some sort of transfer
between the two entities.  If we stopped the
newsgroup-to-mailing-list flow, wouldn't that fix the problem?
