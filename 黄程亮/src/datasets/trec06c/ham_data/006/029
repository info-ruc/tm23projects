Of course :-)

The suggestion sounds quite good to me ... the only problem might be,
imo, that point (b) only delays the emergence of off-topic mails, but
it's worth a try. Point (a) is *very* interesting, since this
mailing-list has been set up in order to separate more technically
based questions on pine from FAQs that are to be posted to
comp.mail.whine (oops :-). In fact, FAQs shouldn't be posted at all,
but that's a different cup of tea.

Ed, Robin what do you think?

l8er, norbert.
