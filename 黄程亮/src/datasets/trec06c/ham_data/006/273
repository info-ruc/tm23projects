hi everyone!
i love using pine and pico as the preferred editor (on a unix platform).
however, i do need to set the tab size to 4 (for work purposes). i was
just wondering if there was any way to do this, as i cannot find any
similar configure commands on pine/pico. any help on this would be greatly
appreciated. thank you.
ps. i know how to do it in vi, but i hate vi and any clones/associates.
