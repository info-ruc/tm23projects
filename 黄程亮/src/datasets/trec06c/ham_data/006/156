Dear all,

	I was wondering how I can convert my pine addies to eudora format,
as I am cancelling this shell account on the 14th. I saw the message from
Svein skjaeveland (Convert Pine Addressbook to Eudora Nicknames
(addresses) 1/17/96) but his site at
http://www.interguru.com/pineudo.html seems to be down. If any of you
could help me out with this asap, it would be much appreciated. Thank you!
