I have a limited supply of Motorola MC68HC711E9CFN2 chips I will trade fo=
r
interesting
electronic components.  I am currently interested in LCD displays and
Universal (Sony)
remotes as well as Gameboy Units and cartridges. =


 The  12K OTP  ROMs have been previously programmed. The chips come with
the OTP ROM =

contents zeroed and the config byte set to  '0C' which turns off the
internal ROM (which makes =

the E9 effectively an E1) and EEPROM. =


I have two operating HandyBoards using these chips without any problems =


Please reply to my email address and not the list if you are interested o=
r
have any questions.
