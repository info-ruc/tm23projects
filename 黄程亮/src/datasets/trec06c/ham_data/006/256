Hi there,

You have run out of disk space, I guess...

Delete some files from your directory, or ask your sysadmin to increase
your quota os space... use the quota command to learn about how much disk
space is available for you... also use the df command to see if there is
enough room in the filesystems to send mail (sometimes if some areas get
full, then you can't send mail). Use the man command to learn about the
quota and df commands: man df & man quota...
