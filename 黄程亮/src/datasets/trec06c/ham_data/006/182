I built an H-Bridge over the weekend to replace the chips on the =
Handyboard and I was wondering what pins on the motor control sockets I =
need to connect the new circuit to? My circuit has a Forward input and a =
Reverse input. I did notice from the schematic that there was an (in1) =
and an (in2) (pins 2 and 7), but haven't had much luck with these.

Thanks for any help anyone can provide!
