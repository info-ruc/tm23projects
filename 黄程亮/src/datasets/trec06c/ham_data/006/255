I guess you're under UNIX. If so, when you're reading the message, type v
to go to the viewer, then a list of the parts which form the message are
displayed, you should then place the hightlight over the part you want to
save (in this case, the picture file), and then press s in order to save
it to the current direcory... at this step a line asking you to enter the
name under which you want to save the file will appear, enter a name,
press enter and voila! :) 

Do you want to get it to your local computer?... well, ftp it from the
UNIX server  with any ftp client (like CuteFTP in Windows, for example).

Saludos.
Rodolfo.
