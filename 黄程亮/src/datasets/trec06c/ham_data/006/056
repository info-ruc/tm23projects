Carolyn;
You should immediately contact your *local* systems administrator about
this.
Members of this list could not render any assistance whatsoever, it's a
problem which must be resolved within your network locally, there are a
dozen possible reasons that this could be happening, and none of us could
troubleshoot your local network.
Sorry we couldn't be of more help to you and Good Luck!
-Colin
