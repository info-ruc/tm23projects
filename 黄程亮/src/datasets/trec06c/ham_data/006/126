Go to the main menu screen of Pine, select "S" (setup) "C" (Configure) and
tab down to "nntp server" 
It should be set to <No Value Set> which will cause Pine to ignore the
existence of a news server.
BTW, before doing that, you might also check out Pine's newsgroup feature
set. It's nicely integrated with the mail client, and is usually a fast
and easy newsreader to use. That however, is just IMHO (In My Humble
Opinion) others may have religous fervor concerning the newsreader you
should use. At the end of the day, it's what suits *you* best that decides
the issue. You can't beat the simplicity of Pine's newsreader though.
Good Luck!
