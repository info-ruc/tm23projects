Check through the file called tech-notes.txt. You can fix configuration options
that users cannot override. There's no need to hide Setup from users; numerous
user-configurable options have no security implications. Why prevent users from
changing those?

What possible reason could you have for hiding the message index? How do you
expect users to get conveniently from one to the next?

You had better explain in greater detail about what you want to do.
