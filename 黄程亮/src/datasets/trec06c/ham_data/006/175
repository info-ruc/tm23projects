Since I began using pine I have had a number of problems which I was
unable to overcome eventhough I  did read your mannual.I have
a text in wordperfect 5.1 format more than 700,000 million byte.Question
1)how can I send this text using pine; 2)if this is not possible into what
form of data should I convert to send it per pine.I shall be very much
glad if you were to promptly respond to my queries.


Yours Sinceryl
