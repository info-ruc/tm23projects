Joshua -

There should be no problems using the Gleason Research libraries (or
any of the libraries that are on the web site).  There are no differences
between version 2.851 and 2.860 from the point of view of the
libraries.

There is a pre-compiled version for Linux.  See

ftp://cher.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/interactive-c/unix/
