Hi -

I'm a handy-board/ic newbie, so please excuse this question if it's answers 
seem obvious.  After two weeks of writing code in DOS/Windows (yuck), I 
downloaded the ic-2.860beta source code, which compiled without significant 
trouble in linux (redhat 5).  The version is, of course, a bit different from 
that which came with the handy-board (from Gleason Rsch, was version 2.851).

My question is, can I just copy the library files that came from Gleason Rsch. 
into the lib directory on the unix ic installation (it seems that I can, I 
just want to be sure)?  Are there any other issues I should be aware of 
(w.r.t. the beta, or using ic from unix, end-of-line conventions on library 
files, etc.).  I'm not particularly concerned with being able to download the 
pcode in unix - I do have DOS easily available...

BTW, thanks to all that have contributed to this really neat project - this is 
my first exposure to robotics, and it's been great fun so far.
