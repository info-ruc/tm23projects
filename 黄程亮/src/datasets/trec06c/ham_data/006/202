Yo, brother,

chant a couple of "man quota"s - that'll help. What's happening is
that that you local system administrator has assigned you a limited
amount of diskspace which you've exceeded. That need not necessarily
be mail, it can be all sorts of files. Do the following:

   du ~/ | sort -n | less

and see where the big files are. You quit less by saying "q". Delete
those files at random.

Cheers,
Robin
