OK, let's get hold of the list owner, and take this to the next step.
Otherwise we'll continue to endure the same blistering "asbestos gloves"
nonsense concerning irrelevant posts and I for one would rather help fix it,
than complain about it, and have to read Robin's "insult du jour" which
bless his heart...gets real old after a while.
I don't mind moderating a new list, I just want the problem to go away by
proactive means. I welcome any suggestions you can come up with.
I asked two people who mis-posted (after *politely* telling them where they
had posted to, and why it/we couldn't help 'em) to send me URL's of any
*actual" resource on the name change thig. If I can get hold of those URL(s)
I'll do up a recipe in procmail to send out an autoresponse that will take
care of those posts.
In the meantime, I wish I knew that anyone from the University actually read
anything from the lists!
