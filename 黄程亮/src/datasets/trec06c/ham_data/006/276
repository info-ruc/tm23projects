Now listen sweetie ...

we're here not at grammar school, sure enough, but you're hell of
lucky that you've received an answer at all. You don't know anything
about a thing called netiquette, do you - really? Have a look at your
f*cking subject ... what do we learn about your problem during the
study of it? That either the operator or the keyboard is broken -
probably both ...

So, just shut up and take the answer as given (in short, get lost).

Malcolm ... hmm, imo it's the 'o' that's lacking :-)

l8er, norbert.
