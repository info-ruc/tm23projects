I have seen this problem here also. What I found is the it is a problem
word mail on exchange client side. If I create a message from exchange
client using the default editor ( NOT WORD or what is called WORD MAIL )
then the message and send it then check the message with pine looks
fine. If I use WORD MAIL on the exchange client then send it and check
it with pine I have trash at the end of the message. I think this is
because WORD MAIL is not ending the document correctly. But I am still
working on it. Can you run a test like this a see if you find the same
thing.

Also can anyone tell me what to look for in the format of the mail
message to find out what WORD MAIL might be doing wrong in the email
message format. If I can find that then I think I can get Microsloth to
look at it. 

Thanks Marty

	Subject:  Garbage in mail bodies using IMAP and Exchange 5.5

	I'm using Pine 3.96 on FreeBSD 2.2.5-RELEASE talking to a
Microsoft
	Exchange 5.5 machine.

	My problem is that when I attach to my Exchange inbox using
IMAP,
	the mail bodies are displayed as garbage characters that contain
	random characters.  Sometimes part of the message is displayed
	and the end is truncaged and/or garbage, and sometimes just
garbage
	is displayed.  The headers always look fine.

	This is not just a display problem, because if I forward the
mail
	to another machine (not running Pine), it sees this garbage
also.
	This leads me to believe that the problem is in the mail itself,
	and is not just a display issue.

	I've put a sniffer on the line to see what is being transferred
	back and forth from Exchange.  Everything looks okay.  The
entire
	message is transmitted from Exchange with no garbage and no
	truncation.  Still the mail doesn't show correctly in Pine.

	I do not have similar problem when looking at a local mailbox.

	Has anyone heard of this problem?  Any hints as to what to try?
	I've looked through the archives but I could not find any
	information.

	Thanks in advance.

	Eric.
