Adam;
    I recently wrote to Ed on this subject. Having read the thread that
seems to have developed, I concur with the apparent concensus that a
moderated list and an unmoderated private one alongside seems to have the
structure necessary to solve the problem.
    I would be willing to moderate a new subscriber's list, and since I
prefer to avoid flaming or retorting to silly-assed queries, maybe that
might be of some help when acting as a moderator. For that matter, perhaps
those core members could rotate moderation on (say) a three month basis. If
we had four willing members, then each would run the list once per year. If
not, then what the hell, I'll moderate it.
    What would be necessary from U/Wash point of view to make this happen,
and would they necessarily agree with the need to do this? Does this become
a policy issue? I have no clue what the possible answers are to any of the
above. Maybe it doesn't matter...I don't know.
    I accede to the wishes of the majority here, but I have the patience to
do it which may help.
