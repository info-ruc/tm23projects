Just a thought...

Rather than going the whole hog and turning the list into a moderated one
(ie, have every article vetted by a human before passing on to the list at
large) how about converting it to become a _closed_ list, so that only
subscribers can post to it?  Then people who haven't subscribed but try to
post would get an error message back telling them that the list is a
closed one, and presumably this could go on to explain (a) what the list
is REALLY for, and (b) how to subscribe.

This would avoid the burden on, and delays in postings caused by having to
filter articles through, a humanoid whilst hopefully significantly cut
down the junk from spammers, web-searchers, and other random odds-n-sods. 

Any comments anyone?
