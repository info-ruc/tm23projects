Subject: Freeware IC problems
Mime-Version: 1.0
X-Mailer: Turnpike (32) Version 3.05 beta 4 <jwHwxXiPEbKuVqlgDFFKqVUDXQ>

I use the Freeware IC compiler. 
I find that every 3-4 attempts of starting IC or loading a file causes
my PC to either hang or crash with garbage on the screen. After a reboot
everything is fine for another 3-4 times! In between the problems
everything works fine.

Any ideas as to the problem? 

Thanks in advance,
