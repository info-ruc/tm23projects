Darn you, I was gonna point that out :P~

Reminds me of the time when I just graduated from HS and put "Honors
Curiculum" on a job application.  The only response I recieved (via US
Postal) was a note reading "Blah blah.. position has been filled.. blah..
P.S. - If you want to emphisize that you took advanced classes in High
School, you should probably spell 'Curriculum' correctly."  Of course,
being a cocky little @#$@, I HAD to respond with a letter stating "If you
want to criticize someone for spelling, you should be sure your own
spelling is perfect first.  The word 'emphasize' is not spelled
e-m-p-h-i-s-i-z-e."  I did not get a reply.
