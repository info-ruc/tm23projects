well maybe I'm dumb and I don't really get what you are heading for,
but as I can see the famous combination of keystrokes should be

c -> compose message

Then, while in the header region

ctrl-j -> attach file(s)
ctrl-t -> to files

This last command opens a file selector. Since I suppose you are on a
Windows Machine (who else would use a backslash to separate
directories?) you'll see one of the famous explorer pop-ups which
you can use to move around (maybe to user/diss) and get the file you
intend to attach.

You might even be lucky that you'll 
(a) get those keystrokes above via mouse (don't know, don't care)
(b) get the desired result
(c) not get shot for disregarding pine's online help ...

l8er, norbert.
