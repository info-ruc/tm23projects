Hi,

your message-id is something like 'Pine.SOL.3.95...'. Therefore, I
guess that you are on a unix machine.

If this holds true, you must ask your local sys admin whether she's
got any backup tapes of your folder collection directory ($HOME/mail
or whatever you've put into your .pinerc), because delete in the unix
world doesn't provide any means to retrieve old files by guessing
strange leading characters.

On Windows systems it should be possible to get them back using
undelete, but I'm absolutely the wrong person to answer this :-)

Hmm ... Ed, is this statement correct? To all the others ... is this
statement *not* offending?

l8er, norbert.
