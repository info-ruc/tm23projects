Hello all,

Here's a thought.  How about just sending a message that reflects the
following sentiment.

"Wrong type of question for this forum."

When the individual gets so 'MANY' responses back from the entire (lots
anyway) pine group they will have figured out that 'hey, maybe this is
the wrong group to ask'.  This might be preferred instead of other
options (no names) that have been used in the past to try to turn people
away.  All that does is - well - nothing.

OK it might be frustrating at first but you are reading your mail
anyway, aren't you???  Like this one for example...

...and as mentioned before, who has the time or really wants to moderate
a list for a large group like this?

Mike...........
