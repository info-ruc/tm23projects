So you see your file in the directory.  OK.  Type 

sz filename

Then it will download your file.  Then you can view that file later with
whatever program you choose.

If you wanted it on a disk, I guess you could copy it there after.  

Windows Explorer could copy the file to your drive A: (supposedly).
Somehow.  Or make a wish.

Let us hope Robin doesn't spam Jennifer.  As she needs help.  Beware.
