  You could use spezial interface chips to solve your problem. Hewlett
Packard has some chips (HCTL2016, HCTL2020) which are easy to use and offer
a lot of features.

I have used the HCTL2020 with the handyboard. If you want to interface the
shaft encoder without special chip you need to measure the pulsewidth of
the signal from the encoder aswell as a direction bit which you can
generate with a simple and-gate. I have written a couple of programs (asm)
to measure frequencies and pulsewidth with the Input Counter of the hc11.
Tell if you need them.
