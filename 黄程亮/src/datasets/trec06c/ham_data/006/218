OK that solves one matter alone Mike....it deluges *that* individual with
mail which says that they've posted to the wrong list. Agreed without
reservation. Yessir...that tells 'em...noooooo question about it!
However, the larger issue is not what you do to Joe Schmo, the one poor
schlemiel who gets 99,000 emails (98,999 of 'em from Robin!) telling him
he's in the wrong place, but what you do to *avoid* getting irrelevent posts
to begin with.
IMHO *that* is the issue, and where we're heading by trying to figure out if
there should be two lists, one for newcomers (er inexperienced NEWcomers)
and one for the folks who realize fully what the heck the list is for, and
who post on (or close to) topic.
A Regarding moderating the list...well for starters, a few boilerplate email
text files would certainly reduce the workload considerably. Time to
accomplish this? I dunno...anyone have any estimates on this??
Oh well...back to the iron foundry
