Hi,

you are absolutely right ... this is not a primary pine problem :-)

The problem with moderation is: who's got the spare time and is
willing/able to read/stand all the crap that is coming along the
strange and twisted channels knocking at the pine mailing-list's
door. It is certainly not possible for me, my chef is going to kill me
on the spot :-/

just my 2p, norbert.
