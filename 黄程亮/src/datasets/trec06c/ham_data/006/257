I received an attached file with e-mail from Canada(a photogragh) and it
apparently needs to be converted with binhex 4.0. 

I have an IBM compatible PC with Windows 95, msPicture-it and Easyphoto.
None of these will open the file('the files format is invalid or not
supported' etc).

HOW DO I DO IT?
