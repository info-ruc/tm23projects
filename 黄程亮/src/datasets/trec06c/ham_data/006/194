I have been using Pine 3.95 for sometime but have never been able to get
it to print for me from the Y command.  I have an Epson LQ 850 printer and
am able to print from the "print scrn" key.

I have read and re-read your "help" message and have tried different
settings but to no avail.

What suggestions to do you have?
