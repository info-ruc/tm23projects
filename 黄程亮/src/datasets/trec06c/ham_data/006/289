It's called Nettiquette, hon.  One thing to make note of, though..
If after asking for help from technical people (that's us), they
actually answer your question, but raz you in addition answering your
question (whether the teasing is playful or not playful is irrelevant),
it is usually not a good idea to attack them, especially with foul
language on a list that is public access. (Little children could read it..
and we all know how impressionable little children are..)

The main reason for this, of course, is that technical people (that's us)
don't respond well to attacks.. they tend to blow up planets and such. (I
knew one fellow who blew up a planet just because someone said he had
funny ears...)

Another good reason would be all the flames you will recieve in
response. (This letter is technically a flame.. I would call it more of a
spark though, since it is rather mild).

Of course, a great reason not to be a
shmuck and "bite the hand that feeds you" even if it is a little rough, 
is that you probably won't get any help if you ever ask again (technical
people [that's us] usually have good memories).

Anyway, that was just my 2p
