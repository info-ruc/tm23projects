I normally ignore both breaches of netiquette and responses to same, since
life is _definitely_ too short. Although I agree with the previous sender 
[ie if you insult a list, you are unlikely to get help from it] I _would_
ask people generally to bear in mind that there are people with real
spelling/grammatical problems out there ie non-native English speakers and
people with dyslexia. 

I should know;- I live with a dyslexic, and have difficulty in communicating 
with his brother [a friend] since he is also dyslexic, and very reluctant
to send email to anybody, let alone lists or newsgroups because he gets
flamed on these points. I should also add that he is one of the most
competent people, technically, that I know. He has tried spell checkers
and various other IT solutions, and they have proved inadequate [words out
of context etc]. Speech to text may solve the problem in the near future,
but it ain't yet really adequate - especially if you have an English, not
an American, accent!

So, please, next time you feel inclined to hit somebody over the head
(metaphorically) for their spelling or their grammar, consider your
immediate reaction first:-)
