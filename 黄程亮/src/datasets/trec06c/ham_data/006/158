simply don't use newsfetch. pine can grab news on its own. use the D key
to "delete" things you read that you don't want to read again (it marks it
as read, and does not delete it from the server. it could be clearer about
that for newbies, but :)  ) 

just keep it set up as it is, just don't use newsfetch
simple as that :)
