Yup.  Another factor was that no-one stepped forward as a volunteer to
re-establish and maintain the gateway.

That was the hope, though I haven't really seen much shift in that

We would love to restrict pine-info postings to subscribers, but there
are just too many pointers to it floating around.  When/if Listproc
can generate a satisfactory "bounce" message for non-subscribers, we
may consider the restriction.  BTW, we're also considering a way to
allow posting to comp.mail.pine through the (re-designed) Bug Report
screen.
