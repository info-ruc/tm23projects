Since Robin is repairing his hard drive, permit me to offer one or two
observations on his behalf.
1. Hit "V" to view the message parts
2.Hit "S" to save (for example an image like a .gif) to your local drive
3. FTP the image down to your local machine using WS_FTP or some similar FTP
program (freeware)
4. Although admittedly a minor matter, it's a gracious practice to
capitalize the first letter of the first word in a sentence, and (usually)
the first person is represented with a capital "I" as opposed to "i"
5. Things are never quite as much of a catastrophe as you think when you
write an email. Give thought to what you are asking, and whom you are
asking. It's unwritten, but recipients tend not to appreciate jumbled syntax
and poorly composed email such as you sent below.
