 chh> what does it mean when it says "read-only" next to the word

hmmm, maybe that the inbox is read only and you can't work with the
mails in it apart from reading them?

But well, let's see ... either you started pine with a '-o' switch
(that's read only for the first folder) or another pine process is
allocating your inbox. In the second case, which is announced by pine
at start up time, kill the other process (you know ... ps -ef | grep
pine ; kill -9 <pid>).

l8er, norbert.
