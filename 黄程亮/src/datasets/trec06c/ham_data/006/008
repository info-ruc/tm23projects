I don't know who the Webmaster is, and who the list-owner is. The Webmaster
would need to change the archives to clearly give a description of pine on any
Web page that has a mailto: URL. I got a letter today on "lxgal nxme chxnge".

Fixing the Web pages would likely eliminate 90% of the irrelevant posts from
nonsubscribers.

Any post from a nonsubscriber would be sent to the moderation pool. Any new
subscriber could be moderated till he asks a relevant question. The list server
used is ListProc, and I assume it could filter mail along these lines.

This is my suggestion. I wish the list-owner would post a message offering the
University's opinion.
