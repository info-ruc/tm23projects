It was indeed bi-directionally gatewayed to comp.mail.pine for quite a
long time.  However the gatewaying broke and nobody noticed for 2-3
months.

They then sought opinion on the List whether the gateway should be
re-established and the result was, if memory serves, that it shouldn't be. 

The idea was, I think, that comp.mail.pine would be more
newbie-question-ish whilst pine-info focussed more on discussing ways of
improving and devloping Pine.

Mark Crispin/David Miller/Another Pine Team Entity... care to comment?
