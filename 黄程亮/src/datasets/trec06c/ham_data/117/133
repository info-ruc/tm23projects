Hi all

Just to note that it's not simple just to choose another font (that works) 
if what is required is a set of characters none of which resemble the 
English alphabet.  In trying out all the Arial Unicode fonts, the only 
appropriate sets that seemed to work were Katakana and Hiragana.  But on 
subsequent testing, DMDX still failed to recognise a few of the characters, 
and since that appeared to occur intermittently or to depend upon where in 
the sequence the character was, I decided that it was too risky to use.  The 
alternative at the moment is making individual bmp files for the about 100 
different sequences.  If some time in the future Arial Unicode characters 
were available, that would be much appreciated.
