RON is based on the assumption that the current internet routing  
protocol BGP is crap.  To an extent, this is true.  BGP is designed  
to operate with minimum overhead, and has to deal with the economic  
policies of all the organizations that provide connections along a  
particular route.  Consequently, sub-optimal routes are often chosen  
due to out of date information or unusual policy decisions.  RON  
attempts to out-think BGP by choosing its own path, and forcing BGP  
to route packets accordingly.  It does this by creating an overlay  
network.  Clients insert packets into the overlay at the closest node  
and the node closest to the destination forwards them appropriately.   
Since a RON is a fully connected graph, in the ideal situation a  
route will be only one hop.  If the network connection between two  
nodes begins to degrade, the RON will attempt to reroute the packet  
through another node.

There are a handful of concerns with this system.  Firstly, the fact  
that the RON is a fully connected graph means that each node has O 
(N^2) state.  This could cause significant scaling issues as the RON  
begins to see more users.  Secondly, since each RON node is  
constantly pinging every other RON node, the network overhead  
associated with the above state is likely to get out of hand  
quickly.  The paper places a theoretical 50 node size limit on the  
network, but as the traffic flowing through the RON grows, the  
individual nodes will become swamped unless more router nodes are  
added.  Moreover, if the internet were to shift over to RON  
completely, then a large number of existing routes would become  
obsolete and unnecessary.

One hop source routing takes a similar approach.  Instead of using a  
network of nodes, it places a series of routers on the internet.  If  
a routing failure occurs between the source and the destination, it  
instead tries routing through an intermediary node rather than using  
a complex overlay network.  The downside to this is that the nodes  
must be known to each source in advance.  A centralized discovery  
service provides a single point of failure, and a distributed  
protocol still requires some form of bootstrap host.  Furthermore,  
deployment of these nodes could get difficult.  Deploying them over a  
global testbed is trivial, but it would be difficult to get a  
corporation to deploy such a router.  Why should they pay for someone  
else's bandwidth?
