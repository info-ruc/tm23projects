Professor Sirer,
   For paper 1 I'm going to research distributed application deployment, 
specifically single image OSes or single image abstraction approaches. 
I'm using the following papers as my "seed set":

Liu, H., et al. "Design and Implementation of a Single Image Operating 
System for Ad Hoc Networks" Mobisys 2005

Lo, V., et al. "Cluster Computing on the Fly..." IPTPS 2004

Tilevich, E. and Y. Smaragdakis, "J-Orchestra: Automatic Java 
Application Partitioning", ECOOP 2002

   Also, I have two other papers due next week and a midterm.  One of 
the papers is for VLDB and the other is involved with other students so 
I can't get extensions for those or the midterm.  I was wondering if I 
could have until Saturday at the end of spring break to finish the paper 
for CS615 (5-25).

Thanks.

--Nick
