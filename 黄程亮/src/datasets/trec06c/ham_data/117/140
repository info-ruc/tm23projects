   If it makes you feel any better it's weeks worth of work to make DMDX 
handle "a few" unicode characters and it runs the risk of upsetting almost 
every single part of DMDX.  Each piece of code that manipulates pointers to 
characters (like almost all of DMDX does) has to be gone over with a fine 
tooth comb because instead of a character being one byte it's now 
two.  Every single string (error messages, anything DMDX prints, you name 
it) has to be wrapped with __T().  Now mind you, RTF files are still going 
to be one byte characters so there's got to be code that intermixes byte 
wide character pointers with 16 bit ones, yeecch.  And then of course we 
have to test these changes.  Months away at the very least and that's 
assuming we decide to do it and I for one ain't leaping at the 
opportunity.  And won't be under any circumstances till we need it here.
