Movie industry sues companies that aid downloads on Usenet

By Hiawatha Bray, Globe Staff

An obscure data network technology called the Usenet has become the
newest battleground between the entertainment industry and digital
music and movie pirates.

Late last month, the Motion Picture Association of America filed its
first-ever lawsuits against Internet companies that help people
download illegally copied films over the Usenet. The association says
that the companies, NZB-Zone, BinNews, and DVDRS, provide a
Google-like search service for Usenet, one that lets its users find
thousands of pirated films, including recent hits such as 'King Kong',
'The Chronicles of Narnia', and 'The 40-Year-Old Virgin.'

The three companies did not respond to e-mail messages requesting
comment. Their websites do not list physical addresses or phone
numbers, and one of them, DVDRS, has apparently been shut down. Even
the lawsuits filed against the companies identify them as John Does,
and do not include contact information.

This is probably no longer true, but in the 60's/70's, Union Electric
(as it was then) still had a 25 Hz grid.  Keokuk in particular had a
number of electrochemical industries that were on this grid.  By the
time Griffin Wheel (an electric arc furnace operation) came to town,
no new customers were being connected at 25 Hz, and Griffin used 60 Hz
power.

I don't know what proportion of Keokuk dam 25 Hz production was
converted to 60 Hz.

Not necessarily ... the resulting waveform would be quite fine
 ... imagine a 25 Hz motor on one side turning a shaft connected to a
60 Hz alternator.

One RPM from the motor is one RPM for the generator, and so forth.  To
the alternator, it doesn't care if it's a 25 Hz motor or steam turbine
or gerbils on a wheel driving its shaft (as long as the speed is
correct and kept reaasonably stable under various loads, of course).

And it's fairly easy to pick an RPM which is a nice common multiple of 
25 and 60 so the math works out OK.

Meanwhile, the alternator output frequency relates to the angular
spacing of the windings and shaft speed.

The alternator would produce nice clean 60 Hz relatively free of
higher order harmonics and other non-linear trash.

If you're not technically astute, you'd better hire a good lawyer
quick.  But at the same time it is getting to be like the situation
with money with cocaine residue on it. For a while in the 80s it was
considered strong evidence of trafficking if you had 20s with cocaine
traces on it.  Then someone showed that most of the money in
possession of police, judges, court officials, people on the street,
and most all money in major cities and soon the entire country had
traces on it.

Most all Internet fraud and other illegal activity is now based on
bogus identities. Any police force of any size who deals with this
knows it and deals with it appropriately. And most local police (at
least here in NC) call in the state guys for this type of stuff as
they have the knowledge to deal with it. Sheriff Bubba doesn't go
after much related to computers.

Not to say people will not get falsely accused, but it should be a
minor part of the problem as time goes on.

I run some mail servers and looking at the appearance of "falseness"
of the incoming mail is the best indicator of things to toss.

"This Old House" showed a gas power "AC" unit from the late 1700s early 
1800s a while back in Savannah (I think). It was basically a cupola with 
a ring of flame from gas that when running would create an updraft and 
pull air throughout the entire house. Quite a bit of air as I recall.

You can still purchase brand new gas or kerosene powered
refrigerators.  Here is a link to one company that showed up in a
quick search.  http://www.thenaturalhome.com/gasappliances.htm I have
no connections with the company nor have I purchased anything from
them.

You can still find units for recreational purposes as well as for
fixed installations like fishing cabins or homes in remote locations.

My fathers camper had a refrigerator that worked on 120v, 12v, or gas.
I seem to remember it would switch and use 120, 12v, or gas in that
order once he turned it on.  The automatic switch-over feature was
nice for times when we were at a remote site and someone left a light
on when we went fishing.  We would come back and find the battery dead
but the refrigerator still keeping things cold using the gas mode.

Gas-powered refrigerators were not terribly uncommon 'way back when'.
Quite uncommon by the 60s, however.

As someone who's worked on standards bodies (insurance industry
computer file exchange issues) it's likely both. The dominant players
(I was one) want to protect their investment, the minor players want
the field re-leveled (break the the installed base) to allow them
entry, and the body as a whole has some mission statement about being
fair, technically advanced, a boon to world peace, a chicken in every
pot, etc ... :)

600V seems high to me from a safety point of view. But I bet it was
chosen to allow existing things to stay in place and was at the limit
of technology for making flexible conductors with jacketing that did
wear out quickly.

Your observation about single phase is correct for UK.  However in
other parts of Europe 3 phase is routinely supplied to quite small
dwellings.

I live in a small 2 bedroom apartment in Belgium of about 80m² which
is supplied with 3 phase with 230 volts between phases and no
neutral. More modern homes are supplied with 3 phase and neutral with
400 volts from phase to phase.

This arrangement makes a standardised pre-wired power distribution box
impossible (except in UK).

As a side note the UK nominal 240 volts is becoming 230 volts and the
rest of Europe 220 volts is becoming 230 volts for European
harmonisation.

The refrigerators in RVs are pretty much all of the absorption type.
This allows them to work on propane, away from commercial electric
power. When commercial power is available, it is used only as a heat
source instead of the propane. No compressors or other moving
parts. The 12VDC system in the RV is used to ignite the propane (so it
doesn't need a pilot), but otherwise, it does not require any
electricity.

Very common.  Almost every RV (Recreational Vehicle) has one.  Actually 
most are powered 3-way. 

1) They run from standard 120VAC when parked and that power source is 
available.  

2) Most also run from 12VDC while the RV is underway.  

3) They burn Propane (gas) when parked and 120VAC is not available.

Not all have the 12VDC option but it is safer to turn the propane tank
off while driving and use the battery instead.

Usually ammonia absorption cycle.  Commonly found in motor homes and
places that don't have electricity, such as remote vacation/hunting
cabins, or small islands.  Google for RV refrigerators to find lots of
sites that explain them better than I can. Only moving parts are the
gas valve and thermostat.

Although this brings to mind a telecom subject.  How can you get
telephone service out to places small islands that have residents who
want phone service?  These sorts of places are usually not that large,
having anywhere from one to a few hundred residents, so not lots of
income potential there.  Nowadays they probably just have cell phones,
if they have coverage.

   The lower the frequency the better an AC
   commutator motor runs.  A 0 frequency or DC
   motor runs best.
   
   When the electric industry was starting
   here in the USA and Canada, two standard
   frequencies were set.  60 Hz for lighting
   and 25 Hz for industrial. (in Europe the
   standards were 50 Hz and 16-2/3 Hz.)
   
   Back in the 1950s visited the NY Central
   Buffalo Station and you could see the
   incandescent lights flicker.  Most of the
   electric power generated at Niagara Falls
   was 25 Hz.
   
   The first railroad AC electrfications had
   commutator motors and so they were

They used to sell little button devices to put in a lamp socket that did
pretty much the same thing with an ordinary 120v bulb. I think it was a
diode to block ever other half cycle. 

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: And did you ever notice how the output 
 from the bulb is always sort of a soft, golden color?  I wonder what
would happen if you used a 240 volt bulb in a socket with one of those
button devices you mentioned as well? Probably some very feeble light 
would result.  PAT]

On Average, the true 411 service base cost for land lines is between $0.21 
to around $0.31 per call to listen to the request, find the listing and to 
release a number to a caller. Before heavy voice automation such service 
took an average of 23 seconds of operator work time to complete a 
transaction. With good standard automation, operator average work times can 
be as low as 13 seconds -- meaning a good DA operator is handling four calls 
per minute!

Heavy voice automation such as Tell-me or Verizon's Darby handle about
30-35% of all calls without ever using an operator, further reducing
the average cost. So it would be save to approximate the average cost
to process one (1) DA call to between $0.18 to $0.26 per DA call. The
actual DA listing costs about $0.04 to $0.05 of the total cost, the
rest of the cost is either operator time or voice platform
infrastructure costs. You might add another penny to the cost to cover
the billing.  Nice margins -- most LECs charge $1.25 for 411
numbers out of their region. AT&T and MCI charge $2.99 per DA call if
you use the old NPA-555-1212 dialing approach

At one time Wireless DA cost a little more as Wireless service was not
as focused on the operator work time as they got air minutes to cover
the longer time to handle a DA call. Today, most DA call centers
handle both landline and/or wireless DA call services. The base cost
remains the same, the only difference might be how many firms are
involved in the actual DA service delivery - causing multiple markups
on the service delivery.

Today DA service is commodity priced. BTW in Italy one Wireless
service provides a video feed DA approach so the caller actually looks
at the DA operator as the service is delivered. Another wireless trend
(now being done in Italy) is (will be) using the GPS coordinates off
of the wireless phone to augment DA service. Hence calling for a pizza
store will no longer require telling what city you want to use for a
pizza look-up. Rather, the GPS coordinates are used to give you pizza
store options nearby where you are located.

[TELECOM Digest Editor's Note: That is why, IMO, a service such as
877-EASY-411 -- which sponsors this Digest -- is such a good deal at
65 cents per one or two inquiries, or one reverse lookup, etc. Once

I studied power a bit 30 years ago in but now my knowledge is a bit
more limited so excuse any technical mistakes. Here in Raleigh, NC and
I'm assume other CP&L/Progress Energy locations, they have been on a
campaign for a while to loop all the 3 phase feeds from the
substations so there are few if any "ends of runs". I don't know if
this started due to Hugo & Fran, just happened at the same time, or
was accelerated due to them. But it sure makes it faster to bring
folks back "on the grid".  Plus as a rule they don't tap transformers
for houses directly off the 3 phase wires. They have runs of a one to
a few blocks attached to a feeder drop below the 3 phase lines which
helps keep the main lines running even when local problems
arise. These feeders are connected with fuses to one of the 3 phase
legs. 

I learned most of this talking to a repair supervisor as it turns out
my pole is one of the first visited after a major storm. It has the
first disconnect switch for the 3 phase loop out of the substation.
And I'm on the substation side. Plus my transformer is still connected
directly to a 3 phase leg which means that I'm one of about 5 houses
in my area to get power before anyone else within about 1/2 mile or
so. I was told unless they had to change out the transformer they'd
leave it connected that way.

As for me, this Sunday evening, for about an hour now the weather
people and the Independence Police have been chattering about 'tornado
clouds forming overhead' and urging people to be prepared to move to
shelter, so I guess I will go somewhere which is safe. A very nice
thing about living here is because we are in a valley area, tornados
are very, very rare. And because police and public servants seem to be
much more interested in providing service rather than doing politics,
etc, there is _no way_ anyone could have missed their several
announcements; television/radio weather stations; the police scanner
(for Independence, rural s.e. Kansas), indeed, even the cable system
itself, with police having taken it over a few times in the past 45
minutes or so telling people to watch out for major chunks of hail,
along with extremely strong winds. So, assuming my house does not get
blown away, I will be back here with you again tomorrow, Monday.  PAT]
