Resilient Overlay Networks
Improving the Reliability of Internet Paths with One-hop Source Routing

A Resilient Overlay Network (RON) is designed to run on top of the existing Internet and facilitate avoiding and dealing with instability and outages that may not be efficiently resolved with existing Internet protocols.  Nodes in different segments of the network are selected to be a part of the RON.  These nodes actively monitor path conditions in order to aid their forwarding of packets that they receive from any other RON clients.  Forwarding can be done based on some particular metrics or for specified applications.  Types of traffic on links can be limited through a policy routing mechanism that is implemented.  Experimental results show that this approach is able to deal with some some types of outages and performance issues better than simply relying on BGP and the current Internet routing infrastructure.

Scalable One-hop Source Routing (SOSR) is another technique to deal with routing around problems in a way that is more scalable and efficient than a RON.  FIrst, the researchers investigated failures on the Internet to get an idea of what problem they were actually trying to solve.  They found that a large number of failures cannot be routed around because they are so close to the destination.  To deal with those errors that can be routed around, in the event of a failure, traffic is attempted to be routed through k randomly chosen intermediaries (random-k).  In this case, random-4 was determined to be a balanced choice that performed reasonably well.  The theory is that if traffic can be routed to an intermediary that is sufficiently far away from the problem area of the network, another route will be found to the destination.  Some more sophisticated routing methods were tested (history-k and BGP-paths-k), but it was shown that the random-k system performs comparably and i!
 s less complex.

As noted in the SOSR paper, one of the main issues with RON is its inability to scale well.  Some issues with SOSR seem to be that its simplicity takes away some of the advantages seen in RON, such as adjusting routing based on some metrics.  Also, for an implementation on a large scale on the Internet, it is not clear what the incentives are to participate in this system, even though the overhead is considered to be "negligible."
