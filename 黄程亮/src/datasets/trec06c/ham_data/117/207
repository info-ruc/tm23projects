A few years back someone reported the problem below, of DMDX not recognisin=
g
the sidewinder game pad, but there wasn't further communication (that
I  could find) to see if the problem was resolved, and I now have the
same  problem. Is it fixable or should I just use a different gamepad? I am
guessing it is because Jonathan reports the results of changing the refresh
rate for USB devices with this particular gamepad.


Many thanks,
