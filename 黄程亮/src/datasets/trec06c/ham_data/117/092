I would like to ask for some indulgance and a sanity
check (DMDX script check actually).

I am not sure if my script is doing precisely what I
intended because the resulting data smells fishy.

Below is one line from an item file which I have
broken up into conceptual chunks here:

(chunk 1 - wait interstimulus interval with fixation
cross) Item #23, display the character "+" for 223
ticks

(chunk 2 - display fixation and cue) display the
characters "+" and "O" for 13 ticks (~200
milliseconds) and start the RT clock with a timeout of
2700 milliseconds

(chunk 3 - display fix)  display a "+" alone for 49
ticks (800 ms)

(chunk 4 - display fix and target)  target = "<<<<<<"
wait for response or end of timeout before moving to
next item.)  



+23 <! spatial.F>  <fd 223>  <XYJustification 1> <XY
0.5, 0.5>  <fm 0.542> "+"  /

<fd 13>  <XYJustification 1> <XY 0.5, 0.5>  <fm 0.542>
"+" , <fd 13> <XYJustification 1> <XY 0.5,0.541>  <fm
1.008> "O" * <Timeout 2700 >  /

<fd 49 > <XYJustification 1> <XY 0.5, 0.5>  <fm 0.542>
"+" /

<XYJustification 1> <XY 0.5, 0.5>  <fm 0.542> "+" ,
<fd 106> <XYJustification 1> <XY 0.5, 0.459>  <fm
1.008> ">>>>>" ;


Now, the reaction time I really want to measure is
from the onset of the target presentation (chunk 4),
but to catch premature responses to the presentation
of the cue (in chunk 2), I start the RT clock with the
cue onset.

So, to calculate the actual valid RT, I take the raw
RT measurement and subtract 13 + 49 ticks (in
milliseconds).

The problem is that the data does not look right.  Is
it possible that the RT clock is measuring from the
start of chunk 3?

Thanks a million!
