I did try using testmode 10 before. The help files you refer to say this:

"A recent problem is devices having cute little symbols as part of the name
making it very hard to get the name of a device into an item file.  To
combat this DMDX dumps the names of available input devices into the
diagnostics, not only that it also checks a parsed version of the name that
has unusual characters removed from it that is also printed in brackets."

My RTF file says this:
<id Microsoft SideWinder Plug & Play Game Pad>

But DMDX says :

available DI device <Microsoft(r) Sidewinder(r) Plug & Play Game Pad>
(Microsoft
SideWinder P  ((then it runs out of screen space))

input device <Microsoft> selection failed
