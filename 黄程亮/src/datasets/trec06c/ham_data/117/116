   Doesn't look like it.  About the only way to be really sure a machine is 
measuring RTs correctly is to build some test apparatus and to bench it 
like I describe in the input documentation.  It's possible you might be 
able to find a timer that can open and close a relay on a regular basis and 
us it to calibrate your machine.
