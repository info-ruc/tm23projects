    _Predicting_Internet_Network_Distance_with_Coordinates-Based_Approaches=
_
    T.S. Eugene Ng and Hui Zhang

    It's hard to respond to this paper -- I'm operating under the assumptio=
n
that you didn't want us to, since it was difficult to ocomprehend the
telegraphic speech present in the powerpoint slides. Nevertheless, the
central concept of the slides is interesting and fairly easy. It is
relatively expensive to do a ping exchange with each other node we wish to
establish a distance to; if we model the internet as a euclidian space, we
can measure distances to central points, and use those as coordinates in th=
e
internet-space so generated; this lets us simply measure distance (in terms
of hop count, or ping time, etc) to obtain an upper bound on actual
ping-time distance. The scheme is fairly good, though somewhat expensive fo=
r
the central servers, albeit at a cost proportional to the carrying capacity
of the network, not the number of distance-related transactions on the
network. Also, outages in the well-known central entities cannot easily be
repaired -- the entire system must remeasure against any new landmark that
is put into the system, which is an individually small cost, but means that
there are definite points of this system which do not scale and cannot be
easily repaired/replaced.

    _Vivaldi:_A_Decentralized_Network_Coordinate_System_
    Frank Dabek, Russ Cox, Frans Kaashoek, Robert Morris

    Vivaldi attempts to measure internet distances via a spring-lattice
structure, allowing disparate peer nodes to communicate information about
physical location -- as measured in milliseconds -- to each other, for rout=
e
selection, etc. Alternate measures are proposed, the most feasible being to
consider the system as not just a two dimensional grid but the surface of a
sphere, and thus the effects of wrap around be internalized to the model.
This is rejected because the internet does not, in fact, tend to wrap
around; America is at the "center" of the world-wide-web, at least for now.
They model the interrnet as a lattice of springs, in that between each pair
of hosts there is some spring with rest length equal to the RTT between the
two nodes. They then minimize the squared error function, which is
equivalent to spring energy, in other words, allowing the springs to acheiv=
e
a natural equilibrium. They divide time into a series of steps, and permit
the springs to act upon those nodes that are out of alignment, thus
converging in a strictly local sense to the correct answer, using only
localized information. In addition, the system models the fact that many
nodes must be routed through a third party as a height vector, derived from
the energy stored in the springs, which means that euclidean distance is
better approximated.
    This is a very tight algorithm, though as pointed out, it is prone to
find locally minimal (energy) coordinate-states rather than globally minima=
l
ones, which means that it is nonoptimal; moreover, it is night impossible t=
o
do simulated annealing or other such random-restart processes, making it
difficult to recover from these states, without introducing wild shifts.
Unrelatedly, the system seems logically incomplete: though they model
distance from the internet core as distance above the euclidean plane, ther=
e
are two cases which are not easily distinguished in this model and not well
handled: sites that are near each other, yet distant from the internet core=
,
and sites that are equidistant from the internet core and removed from each
other. In the first case, the system behaves perfectly, taking the distance
between two euclidean "tall" points essentially ignoring the height (if
equal). In the latter, however, they will be at the same "height" (if
equidistant from the core) and thus this extra travel time will not be
factored in correctly, and thus must be modeled entirely in euclidean
distance in the plane. This is a degenerate case of their algorithm (with
all heights equal to 0) and thus throws suspicion on the height.


 _Meridian:_A_Lightweight_Network_Location_Service_without_Virtual_Coordina=
tes_
    Bernard Wong, Aleksandrs Slivkins, Emin Gun Sirer

    This version may be described as a set of series of concentric rings;
each node maintains some neighbor set organized as rings. These rings vary
over exponential radii, and are maximized based on local measurements (in a
local n-space, the paper maximizes the volume of the object formed between
the various neighbors). This is also prone to local optima which are not
globally maximum, or even necessarily very good, but the system may take
wider swings and thus is not as prone to stultifying as other systems. It i=
s
a decentralized system with excellent (logarithmic) performance measures.
    The system is interesting in that it doesn't have the same sense of
direction as others with more absolute senses; rather than providing
absolute coordinates and thus euclidian direction, there are strict
distances. The fact that state may be maintained locally per-node for
wide-ranging maxima is almost icing on the cake.
