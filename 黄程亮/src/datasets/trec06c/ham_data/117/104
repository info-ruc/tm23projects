Hi.

I got that error often, and solved it by increasing the delay parameter.
(I still get it, but only after a timeout in the previous trial).

I suppose it should be possible for you to get the timings you want by
using <fd>, no?

So far as I remember from what Jonathan said, it can also be solved by
inserting the delay instruction in each item, instead of in the
parameters line. But you still get those frames not moving into memory
exactly 4 ticks late, but no error (right, Jonathan?)
