Resilient Overlay Networks

Lower level routing algorithms like BGP are sometimes slow to respond to 
failures and reconfigure themselves to use alternative paths. The paper 
proposes a "do-it-yourself" solution to this problem, where nodes in a 
distributed application form an overlay which can be used as an 
alternative routing substrate. Nodes monitor the state of the links 
between themselves and choose an alternative path when an outage occurs. 
This happens much faster then the adaptation of the underlying routing. 
Since the system keeps n^2 number of links only a single node is enough 
to form an alternative path.

The tight coupling between the client application and the routing 
provides additional benefits like the ability to choose a specific path 
metric for each application, as well as application specific notions of 
what constitutes a network failure. Overlay routing also allows routes 
to use private peering paths between different autonomous systems that 
are unavailable for traditional routing.

The paper presents a great and simple idea. The biggest drawback is that 
it proposes that every node knows every other node, which does not scale 
well.


Improving the Reliability of Internet Paths with One-hop Source Routing

The paper presents optimization over RON. Its main point is that 
maintaining n^2 links is unnecessary. Instead, the authors suggest 
keeping a smaller number of links would be enough because the source 
node can try its peers in sequence until it find a path to the destination.

The problem that the papers solves seems very much like searching in an 
unstructured p2p network. Perhaps a simple flood will be much more 
efficient. It is not expensive in this case, because it will happen 
rarely. In addition, it guarantees that the destination will be reached 
in the shortest possible time. The path found will also most likely be 
the one with lowest latency.
