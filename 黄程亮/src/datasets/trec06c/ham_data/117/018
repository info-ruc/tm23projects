We have (mainly) successfully used fonts such as SimSun for Chinese.
There are still a few issues though - every so often DMDX mistakes one
of the Chinese characters for a DMDX control character (such as $ ; ,
etc). Even allowing for that it's a whole lot easier than going down the
graphics route, which we've had to do with E-Prime and believe me that
can take ages !
