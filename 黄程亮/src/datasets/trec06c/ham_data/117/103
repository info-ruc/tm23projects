Dear all,

I have tried to run an experiment on a new computer and received 
repeatedly the following type of error message *Display error at ms %d, 
tick %d in %d, frame "%s" moved into video memory %d ticks late *(see 
end of mail for full error message).

The new computer has the following motherboard:

Gigabyte GA-8I945G Pro

Which has the following chipset

Intel i845 chipset

I am using the onboard graphics (Intel 82845G), which states that a 
minimum 64MB and a maximum 128MB of memory is available.

The experiment runs fine on older computers (which have different chipsets).

This is what we tried to do to solve the problem, but with no success:

1. Turned off hyperthreading
2. Updated the chipset drivers
3. Updated the video drivers
4. Disabled all start-up programs and non-windows services
5. Turned off screen saver and power management

What else can we do to try to solve the problem?

From previous messages on the mailing list (august 2003), I understand 
that the Intel i845 chipset might be at the origin of the problem...

Note that if I increase the value of <d x> (e.g. from <d 4> to <d 76>), 
I have no error message anymore, but this is not a solution for me really.


For your information,

here the full error messages:
