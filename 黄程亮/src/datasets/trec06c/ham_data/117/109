Dear colleague,



1. Action solid, PLEASE tell us what you are NOT doing!

Many members have already used the new web form to tell us about the action
they are undertaking.  The form is easy to use, you can remain anonymous
and it enables the union to show that the action is having a major impact.



Go to http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1548 now to tell us how you
are supporting the action, and go back every time you do something new.
Please help us to publicise the action by telling us what you are doing,
however small.



2. Employers threaten to use non-union labour to break boycott - external
examiners, be vigilant

In a sign of how rattled they are, some universities are now threatening to
use non-union casual labour to clear any marking backlog. Leaving aside the
fact that this will only inflame the situation further, you can help us in
the following ways:


  * If you are an external examiner be vigilant on any issues of quality
when you oversee already marked scripts.     * If you have particular
concerns about the marking of assessments and examinations raise it with a
senior figure in the university.    * For example, the QAA Code of Practice
suggests external examiners write a confidential report to the head of
institution on matters of 'particular importance or sensitivity'.



3. Take the message to your students

In response to many requests we have produced a letter for you to hand out
to your students to explain the background to the boycott.  Please free to
amend according to your own circumstances.  The letter can be found here
http://www.aut.org.uk/media/docs/b/g/payaction_dearstudent.rtf



4. Strike day media frenzy

Our strike action resulted in an unprecedented level of media interest in
university pay levels.  Thanks to those members who did interviews, rang
phone-ins, wrote to their local paper.  Everything helps, and we have
collected as much of the coverage as we can.  Tuesday's action certainly
kept the press office busy this week trying to put all the coverage
together. This week's digest collates what we've had in so far so check if
your local media is covering the action and if they are a friend or foe. If
they're not reporting what's happening locally then do get in touch with
them. If you need any advice contact Dan in the press office at
mailto:dan.ashley@aut.org.uk.  Also check in to find out if your v-c is one
of the 33 earning a higher salary than the prime minister.

http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1562



5. More pay at the top -- how they justified those massive increases

As the Times Higher said yesterday:



"Until the leaders of higher education show the same restraint they are
demanding from the unions, disputes like the current one are bound to be
well supported."



They were referring to the 25% average increase over three years for
Vice-Chancellors.  You can view the full table at
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1561.  It is also worth noting
that UCEA and Universities UK in a joint statement said that:



"their [VCs'] remuneration packages reflect what it takes to attract,
retain and reward individuals of sufficient calibre, experience and talent
in a growing sector."



What a pity they do not apply the same standards to those who actually do
the work.  It seems extraordinary that VCs, some of whom have seen their
pay grow by as much as 60%, are calling on you to show "restraint" when
they show anything but that for themselves.  AUT has today written to Ruth
Kelly to call for an inquiry into how these exorbitant salaries are set.



Thank you for taking the time to read this.



All/best



Matt Waddup, ags
