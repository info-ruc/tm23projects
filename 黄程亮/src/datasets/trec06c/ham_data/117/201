Hi there,

We recently upgraded our lab computer's OS to XP.  Prior to this DMDX ran 
fine.

On re-installing DMDX (newest version) we get an error message when trying 
to run files saying "Could not find registry key..."  After running 
advanced video-mode tests in Time DX and saving the values, we are still 
presented with the same message.  I've also noticed the refresh rate found 
by TimeDX is over 33ms (screen resolution is 1024x768).  You mention in a 
previous thread this could be a problem with XP drivers, have you any 
recommendation how we can solve this problem?

Thanks,
Lucy
