Dear Alice and Mariam,

I am writing to confirm that the Literature Section has agreed to sponsor a 
new literary group that is seeking to be recognized as an ASA 
organization.  The name of the group is MIT Student Literary Society, and 
the co-presidents are Alice Chiang and Mariam Shaikh.  The organization 
will focus on broadening students' perspectives through interactive 
literary analysis.  It is designed not only to expose each member to 
different genres and peer interpretations, but also to develop leadership 
skills by coordinating discussions.

We have met with Ms. Chiang and Ms. Shaikh and discussed what role the 
Literature faculty might play as the MIT Student Literary Society takes 
shape.  The group initially plans to choose novels to read and then to hold 
weekly meetings to discuss the current selection.  I will act as faculty 
adviser to the group, assisting with selection of books and perhaps 
suggesting a structure so that reading and discussion of later books can 
build upon ideas that have been of interest in earlier books.  The 
co-founders have already made the acquaintance of some members of the 
Literature faculty and will be encouraged to meet others at our Monday 
&quot;teas.&quot;    From time to time, if there is a faculty member who is an expert 
on a particular book or genre, perhaps that faculty member will offer 
advice or attend a book club meeting to answer questions or lead discussion.

We will provide financial support for the remainder of the Spring 06 
semester of approximately $300 for book purchases plus $20-$30 per meeting 
for refreshments.  Assuming the project gets off to a good start, we will 
be glad to consider a similar financial commitment for academic year 
06-07.  We will also request space in a Building 14N conference for evening 
meetings of the group.

We are very happy to be involved in this project, which we think will be of 
interest to many undergraduates.  We hope it will thrive and will be glad 
to help in additional ways that may become apparent in the future.

Please let me know if you need additional information.
