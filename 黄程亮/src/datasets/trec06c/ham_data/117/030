Check out the Times Higher Ed tomorrow - apparently there's going to be a table of VCs' salaries.

Also please find below details of action short of a strike.

Subject: Campaign update 8 March 06

Dear all,



First of all, a big thanks to all you for your work in organising
yesterday's fantastic strike. There were thousands of pickets out right
across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and many thousands
more members attended the various rallies and meetings. We have posted a
round-up of reports from the day on the web. You can find it at the
following link: http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1559



As of today, we begin our Action Short of a Strike and accordingly, Sally
Hunt has written to all members reminding them that we are asking them to
boycott assessment and examinations, to refuse to honour call-out
arrangements, boycott staff appraisal and refuse to cover for absent
colleagues.



Alongside our advice to members on what constitutes Action Short of a
Strike and who is covered by this call, we've compiled a Frequently Asked
Questions document for members and a guide for LAs titled 'Organising Your
Action Short of a Strike'.
(http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/k/1/organisingasos.pdf)

These documents can all be found at the following link:

http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1519



The basics, however, are pretty straightforward:


  * Appoint an Action committee to coordinate reporting on the action and
supporting those taking it


  * Make sure everyone knows about the action with regular bulletins and
use your websites


  * Hold regular meetings and visit your members to boost their morale


  * Tell us what's happening! Use the Action form on the national website
(see, email us directly or use the activist list. However you do it, get
the information to us so that we can counter the employers' propaganda



Finally, the Times Higher Education Supplement is tomorrow publishing its
annual report on Vice Chancellors' salaries and it's certainly an
eye-opener! Some of those pay rises are just breathtaking. AUT will be
calling for an inquiry into how VCs pay is assessed and awarded.
