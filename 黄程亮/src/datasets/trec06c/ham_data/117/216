Hi 
I don't know if this answers your question, but have you tried copying and
pasting a concept box that is of the correct width. You can paste endless
copies of the same box.

-----------------------------------
Hi everyone,

I am just beginning to use this software, but the possibilities seems to 
be endless, so it's very exciting.

I just have one question I haven't been able to answer either through 
the help or the mailing-list archives. I would like to set a fixed 
dimension, particularly a fixed width, to some of my concept boxes. I 
guess I am trying to reproduce the behavior of the "wrap automatically" 
option from PowerPoint.

If anybody could indicate me a work-around or a pointer to help achieve 
that goal, it would be very helpful.

I need this kind of behavior because I am trying to use Cmap to build a 
structure before entering text items inside the structure, and it would 
be easier to do it this way.

Thanks a in advance for your time and consideration.
Regards,
Julien
