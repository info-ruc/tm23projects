SPARC PARTNERS WITH THEORETICAL ECONOMICS
TO PROVIDE TOP-QUALITY OPEN ACCESS RESEARCH

New Journal an Alternative to Two High-Priced Commercial Publications
Washington, DC =96 SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic =20
Resources Coalition) has partnered with Theoretical Economics (http://=20=

econtheory.org), an open access journal created by the Society for =20
Economic Theory as an alternative to two high-cost publications. The =20
new, peer-reviewed outlet for high-quality research in economic =20
theory provides an alternative to the Journal of Economic Theory and =20
Games and Economic Behavior, both published by Elsevier.

As an open access journal, Theoretical Economics allows authors of =20
articles to retain unrestricted rights to use their articles for non-=20
commercial purposes, including the right to make and distribute =20
copies in the course of teaching and research and the right to post =20
accepted papers on personal or institutional Web sites and in other =20
open access repositories. Theoretical Economics submits the metadata =20
of published papers to RePEc and encourages authors to place their =20
articles in appropriate open access repositories in order to render =20
the article metadata accessible to third-party search and discovery =20
services via Open Archives Initiative metadata harvesting protocols. =20
Theoretical Economics has a long-term data archiving plan in place =20
via T-Space (based at the University of Toronto) to guarantee that =20
published research will be available into the future.

=93Open access journals like Theoretical Economics promote the future =20=

of research, discovery and learning through the timely dissemination =20
of relevant information and through mutual support for scholars,=94 =20
said Heather Joseph, SPARC Director. =93As SPARC expands into the =20
social sciences, the field of economics presents a promising =20
opportunity for researchers who want their work to have a global =20
reach, and Theoretical Economics uses current technology to great =20
advantage to give authors the best options for publishing their =20
articles.=94

=93Theoretical Economics aims to become the leading field journal in =20
economic theory=94, said Martin J. Osborne, the Managing Editor of the =20=

journal. =93It is the first open access journal to provide an =20
alternative to the top-ranked journals in the field. We believe that =20
its success will encourage others to establish high-quality open =20
access journals in other fields of economics, reclaiming full control =20=

by the profession of its research output.=94

Volume 1, Issue 1 of Theoretical Economics was published on March 2, =20
2006.

***
Society for Economic Theory
Society for Economic Theory is a non-profit corporation devoted =20
exclusively to the spread of scientific knowledge in economic theory. =20=

Its journal, Theoretical Economics, is on the web at http://=20

SPARC
SPARC (Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) and =20
SPARC Europe are an international alliance of more than 300 academic =20
and research libraries working to correct imbalances in the scholarly =20=

publishing system. SPARC=92s advocacy, educational, and publisher =20
partnership programs encourage expanded dissemination of research. =20
