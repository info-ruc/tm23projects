  Some on this list think that hardware vendors are afraid of giving away<br>
  trade secrets by developing open source drivers. I don't think that is<br>
  the case at all. Many vendors just don't want to be associated with<br>
  anything as unprofessional as Linux and, in particular, Linux developers.<br>
   <br>
  It really doesn't matter if somebody makes the world's greatest operating<br>
  system. To a vendor, it's just stuff that fits in the box. What does matter<br>
  is the perception that customers have. Customers just don't need to deal<br>
  with a bunch of arrogant snipers who, like small children, keep snapping<br>
  at each other as in some sniveling sibling rivalry.<br>
   <br>
  They also don't need to deal with kernel interfaces which continually<br>
  change, only for the arrogance and vicissitudes of the changer, to<br>
  be changed again when that changer is out-shouted.<br>
   <br>
  If Linux wants to attract professionals, Linux must act in a professional<br>
  manner. To quote, &quot;Nobody ever got fired for specifying IBM.&quot; Quite<br>
  the opposite is true of Linux.<br>
   <br>
  The amateur &quot;GPL&quot; fiasco where, like lemmings led to the sea, developers<br>
  have given their work to some cult figure. In addition, some who have no<br>
  rights to do so, have also signed over the work of others to this same<br>
  cult leader. Such activity invalidates any &quot;license&quot; that anybody might<br>
  have thought they had.<br>
   <br>
  So, if you want to play with the big boys, Grow up!<br>
   <br>
  Very Truly Yours,<br>
   <br>
