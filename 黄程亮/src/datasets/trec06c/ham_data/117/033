Yeah, hadn't thought of that.  Scramble shouldn't pick up on dollars that 
are outside quotes but a semi-colon is a semi-colon no matter where it 
occurs even if it is part of a font kludge.  Well, there's only so far you 
can push an program that was designed in the early 80s and getting it to 
handle those instances correctly makes building a unicode version of DMDX 
look appealing ;)  I always though version 4 of DMDX would be a 3D or 64 
bit version but I guess it could be unicode instead.
