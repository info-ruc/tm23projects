   Could be the hard disk is failing or hopelessly screwed up, you might 
want to check it and do a full scan of the thing.

   You could put another video card in to at least see if the problem goes 
away if not as a permanent solution.

   You can scan it for viruses and malware.  We like the Microsoft Defender 
beta for the malware.

   You can also try a clean install of the OS on another hard disk and see 
if there's something screwed up with the OS (like malware).

   Perhaps a different video mode, say a 32 bit will speed things up.

   Maybe but loading an image in 4 ticks is going to strain a lot of machines.

   Seeing as you don't care about rigid ISIs though I'd just go with <Delay 
0> in the parameter line and let DMDX stuff the thing up whenever it can.
