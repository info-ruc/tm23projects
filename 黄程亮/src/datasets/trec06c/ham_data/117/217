Dear Ken,

Thankyou for all the help that you and Jonathan have given with regard to DMDX.

This is just a small update on what I have been doing.

I did very well in my Diploma of Education and I have spent the last two years teaching
mathematics and psychology in Geelong and North Melbourne.

At present I am involved in literacy and numeracy support at local schools and I am trying to integrate the DMDX system into that support process.

For a number of years I was engaged as a Leader in a Youth organization (one to which I belonged when I was young). I made so many friends and had so many good times (and adventurous). Luckily there were still some people there whom I knew when I was young!. They are very skilled in organizing adventures and the challenges we gave the boys and girls were so momentous that there is no doubt that these would later be wonderful memories (to me also). In one incident a sudden storm overturned one of our sailing boats (on a Gippsland inlet)(with 9 boys and girls and 2 leaders and it took all afternoon to get the boat upright and to shore! But today, unfortunately, the rules and regulations on safety are so strict that such adventures are out of the question.

I still look for possible variables which may be important in the reading process and if I remember correctly in a previous email I mentioned that there is one that may have been overlooked. I refer to Carroll's measure of DISPERSION. This seems to me to lie midway between frequency-based-access and semantic analysis as dispersion is a measure of the different contexts in which a word occurs. And contexts can be construed as semantic fields. Of course frequency and dispersion are highly correlated and together make a highly predictive principal component. It is often mentioned in education that reading in diverse subject areas helps develop reading.

Best of luck in your golfing! 

If you have any recent research available on semantic categorization I would be very grateful if you could send me some information.

Yours Sincerely

Garry.
