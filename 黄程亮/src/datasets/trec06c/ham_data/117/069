Hi,

I'm having a problem with a long (half second) lag time between segments of 
my trials.  Each problem my subjects do actually has three parts, which I'd 
like to appear seamless on the screen, but I'm gettting an unfortunate 
blank screen while dmdx moves from one to the next.  In the program below 
you can see that the first part is a word problem that stays on screen for 
5 seconds, then replaced by an abstract picture for 5s, and then the word 
problem returns.  The major problem is that when the screen is blank the 
timer is also off -- and this means that if subjects respond during this 
interval it goes unrecorded.

You can see below that I've tried to use the media life command to buffer 
the pic:

0 <sd> <ml 1000> <bmp> "AbPic4" ;

I also tried:

0 %0 <ml 1000> <bmp> "AbPic4" ;

(If you try to run the program below you probably need to change the font 
color of the program so it's not black on a black screen; also insert a bmp 
pic in line 0122; and not that i'm working at a laptop so the refresh rate 
in the parameter line is set to 60.)

THANKS,

Carlo Cerruti
