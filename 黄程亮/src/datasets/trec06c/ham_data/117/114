Hi all

Apparently there has been a query from some students about whether some lecturers might be refusing to supervise student dissertations in connection with the action.  Apparently Bath Student Union had published something in which this was claimed.

The guidance says that supervision is teaching and goes ahead as normal. It is only the marking of the work that is boycotted.
