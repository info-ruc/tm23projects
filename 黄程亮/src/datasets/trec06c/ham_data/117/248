	The first paper, "Predicting Internet Network Distance with
Coordinates-Based Approaches," presents architecture to predict
network distance between nodes by using network embedding. Their
proposed system is called Global Network Positioning. In their system,
it include two set of hosts (two-tier system), which include Landmarks
and ordinary hosts. Landmarks are a small set of hosts who compute
their own coordinate. Landmarks' coordinate will use as a reference
for computing coordinate for other ordinary nodes. To compute the
Landmarks' coordinate, Landmarks first collect all the pairwise RTT of
Landmarks. Then, it minimizes the overall error of all the predicted
distance with the measured RTT. Using the coordinate of the Landmarks,
ordinary node sends a ping message to calculate the RTT to each of the
landmark, and minimizes the overall error of all the predicted
distance between the node and all Landmarks with the measured RTT to
all the Landmarks. This system will exchange N^2 messages to compute
the coordinate of the Landmarks, where N is the number of Landmarks.
And each additional node will require N message to compute its own
coordinate. In the paper, it compared GNP with IDMap and triangulated
heuristic to show that GNP has a higher accuracy in predicting the
network distance than existing approach. However, GNP requires
Landmarks to be up all the time. Also, the choice of landmarks affects
the GNP prediction of RTT.
	The second paper, "Vivaldi: A Decentralized Network Coordinate
System," presents a similar, but decentralized approach of GNP.
Vivaldi simulates systems by placing spring between each of the
pairwise nodes with the rest length set to the RTT. The potential
energy of such a spring is proportional to the displacement of its
rest length. And we want to minimize the energy over all springs (the
error function). Each node simulates its own movement and computes its
own coordinate in the system. Whenever a node communicates with other
node, it measures the RTT and learns that node's current coordinates
and the accuracy. Based on the information it receives, node updates
its own coordinate. They show that the accuracy of Vivaldi is as good
as the accuracy in GNP while Vivaldi is completely decentralized. They
also provide some interesting coordinate space to simulate the
accuracy of Vivaldi. However, this system assumes that all nodes are
cooperative in reporting their information.
	The third paper, "Meridian: A Lightweight Network Location Service
without Virtual Coordinates," presents an architecture to select
closest node to a target, minimal latencies to a given set of nodes,
and select a set of nodes given latency constraint to a target.
Instead of using network embedding, the author narrows the network
coordinate position problem to a node selection problem. Meridian uses
a loosely structured overlay network to maintain multi-resolution
rings. Radius of each ring is exponentially farther. Nodes measure
distance of nodes and places O(LogN) nodes into ring i where ri <
distance < r(i+1). Each node periodically measures other nodes in the
same ring. Then, meridian will only put the most k diverse nodes into
the ring. Meridian nodes can locate the closest node to a target by
looking at the node which is closer to the current nodes. At each
step, the node greedily picks a closer node to the target. Since there
are exponentially more nodes to pick from when it is closer to the
Meridian nodes, it can have this zoom in effect. The experiments show
that it is more accurate to select the closest node to target than the
previous network embedding approach.
