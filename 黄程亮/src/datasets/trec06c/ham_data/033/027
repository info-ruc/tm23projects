Yes, I had a similar problem. I then downloaded the revised files and found
"lib_hb.c" failing to load also. After opening it in a text editor, I found the
same 'line feed' type of characters
(square boxes). I deleted them and made sure that all the comment lines (
/*..........*/) were paired evenly. That solved the problem. The expansion
board files all loaded correctly.
