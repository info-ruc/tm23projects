Thanks for your response.  When we load the pcode_hb.s19file with the
right CONFIG it seems to load properly.  We then turn the HB off and back
on and try to load the Interactive C. This does not work at the
computer says "attempting to linkt to board on port com1
Synchronizing with board ..."

no repsonse from this.   The LCD screen is blank during tis time.

Help  ?

PS The buzzer is turned on with a light pitch for the entire time.
