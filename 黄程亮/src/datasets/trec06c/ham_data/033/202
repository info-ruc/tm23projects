Hi!

I'm extremely happy today, that I could start mounting my Hand Board. The
reset chips arrived and now the only thing that's missing is the lcd, but it
should arrive by next Monday.

I've mounted the serial comm board and it worked ok, and I've mounted the
cpu board untill the first boot test. It's very easy to mount the board
following the hba instructions, congratulations for that Fred and others!!!

I'd like to know if it's ok to have a strange wave form in the E clock pin
(5). It's not a perfect square wave, but it's running stable at 2 MHz and
the cristal signal is a perfect senoid at 8 MHz.

I can't wait to arrive at job and continue the mounting!

See you,
Cesar
