Fred,

I too am having trouble with parsing of the expansion libraries.
I just downloaded your new versions:

  lib_hb.c     2/2/99   8:15 AM
  hbsensor.c   2/2/99   8:20 AM

Error message as follows:

  Synchronizing with board
  Pcode version 3.10 present on board
  Loading lib_hb.lis.
  Loading lib_hb.c.
  Loading lib_hb.icb.
  Loading libexpbd.icb.
  Loading expsens.c.
  Loading expservo.icb.
  Loading explego.icb.
  lib_hb.c(2): parse error close to token "*"
  Errors, unloading files
