Hello,

I know that this is slightly off topic, but does anyone know of a
company that sells a stand-alone sonar ranging unit that works from 0"
to 20"?  i know that poloroid makes the one made to be interfaced with a
microcontroller, but do they make one that is self-sufficient?  or any
other company perhaps.  any help would be appreciated.  thanks.
