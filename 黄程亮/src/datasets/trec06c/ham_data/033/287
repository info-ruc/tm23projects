I am using the Newton labs version 3.2. I just downloaded the newly
updated files from 

  http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/hbexp30/

and everything loads properly now. It seems that some erroneous 
characters were in a few of the files, but that all are fixed now.

Try downloading the files again, and make sure they are in the 
ic\libs directory, not the folder \ic\libs\expansion-libs that 
winzip created upon extraction. You have to manually copy these
to the \ic\libs directory. Also, note that the lib_hb.c file
in the expansion file set replaces the old one.

Which version of IC are you using?
