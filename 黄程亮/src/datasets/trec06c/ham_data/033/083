hi cappy & others (sorry non-mac people),

i've put up a revision of the Mac 6811 Downloader MCL.

this version checks that everything's copacetic before dumping the
.s19 file into external RAM.  in other words, it checks that the
desktop is properly talking to the loader routine that it's put into
the HC11's internal RAM.

so, if your serial connection isn't working, or the HB wasn't in boot
mode when you started, you'll now get an error dialog.

i've also added a "Set Config" option, which burns the HC11's config
register to the proper value for use with IC.  this only needs to be
done to HC11s straight from the factory, or in rare cases where power
surges cause the HC11 to lose its config setting.

cappy, you should definitely download this version to help debug your
serial problems.
