Use an LM317T adjustable voltage regulator and 2 resistors.  If you can't
find a data sheet on it on the net somewhere, someone should be able to
give you the formulas for figuring out the resistors.  Find national
semiconductor on the net and you should be able to find a datasheet there
in .pdf format.
