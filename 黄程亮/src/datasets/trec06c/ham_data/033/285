Hi all,=20
I'm new to the list, handyboards, IC, and robotics, but I'm not totally =
clueless so bear with me...

So I got an HB from Pat Hui, and it seems to work fine. I've been able =
to write a program that will vary a beep tone and print variable values =
for light intensity and tone value (my first program!). It uses for now, =
eight duracels in the supplied battery case.

My problem seems to be the servo function. I've wired a Futaba 148 as =
per instructions and loaded servo.icb and servo.c. there are no other =
programs loaded. I am running IC ver 3.2, though the screen still prints =
ver 3.1(?). I have initialized the servo function by typing "servo_on()" =
at the IC prompt. I can't seem to get any activity through the servo =
using  interactive commands such as "servo(1550)" or "servo_deg(45.0)", =
agin, at the IC prompt. When I run these commands, I do get a value =
returned occasionally from the board though with no servo activity. More =
likely I get an error message - "Board not responding to 119 (w) =
command".

Am I doing something wrong here? Do I need to implement the commands =
through an actual c program? Wrong batteries? Somebody please help the =
lowly newbie!

Thanks alot.

If you do send a response to the board, please cc my direct mail =
address, I might not be able to find the post on the list. Thanks again.
