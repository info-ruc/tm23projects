I have had excellent results with the Introl C compiler demo.  In fact,
the demo has more than enough capability to do some very interesting
things.  Just for the fun of it, I wrote a multitasking operating system
and some basic libraries for the handyboard using the Introl *DEMO*
compiler.  You just have to work within the limitations of the
compiler.  If anybody is interested, I could post some additional
information.
