Hi!

Amazing when I listened MY HandyBoard playing the Pink Panther theme!!!
Again thank you very much to Fred and everybody who helped him, you really
did a very great job! I was waiting for this moment for about three months!


>Do anyone  know who sells handyboards in Italy ?

I'm very glad today, but I can't help you because I live in Brazil. Italy,
let me see, yes, I remember the 1994 World Cup decision! :-)  I'd suggest
you BG Micro, because they send good electronic pieces all over the world.

>A lot of similar boards,
>but not the MIT's one.

I'd suggest you get all the parts from the chepear distributors, and mount
your HB yourself as the instructions are very clear and you should be able
to buy the excellent Douglas Electronics PCBs.

Best regards,
Cesar
