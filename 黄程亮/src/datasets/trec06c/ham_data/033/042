hello,
I use program "sonar.c" and i have a problem.
that is 
i run program (load sonar.c  by ic.exe  then type  sonar_display();  ) 
to handy board,for measuring distance between 6" - 35"
 but the display (LCD )shows 
integer(number) between 0- 32767 ,that is ,the  ultrasonic transducer
can measure distance 0 to 6 feet .
so i want to measure more 35" or > 32767 ( in specification for 
ultrasonic 6500  module can  
measure 6'' to 35" ) How can i do?
i used to change int to long but IC program  didn't allow.(illegal )


please tell me.

thank you very much.
