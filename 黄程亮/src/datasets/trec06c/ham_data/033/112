I had my robot in a box for about two weeks when I went to turn it on the 
battery was dead.  Now when I turn it on nothing happens the LEDs don't go 
on and nothing happens, except I can smell burning.  When I touch the 6811 
it is a bit warm but not extremely hot.  Where can the short be?  Please 
help I really need this solved quickly.  It happens both when I use the 
charger board and when I use the direct power jack.

Thank You,
