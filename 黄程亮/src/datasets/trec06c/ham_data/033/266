As a HandyBoard *old timer* (I've had mine for almost two months) I've 
found that the best source of 68HC11 info is Motorola.  Their
documentation
is *free*.  Here are 3 manuals that are a must:
M68HC11RM/AD		Reference Manual
MC68HC11A8/D		Technical Manual
MC68HC11A8RG/AD		Programming Reference Guide
All three are available at:
