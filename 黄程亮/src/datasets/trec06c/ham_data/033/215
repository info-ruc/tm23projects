Hi all,

Do you remember me asking if the HandyBoard was working on an iMac with an USB/Serial adapter?

Well, all the USB/Serial adapters have been back ordered for the last 4 months, so I was unable to find or try any of them ;^(. But I bought an iPort for $60 at my local Fry's (for more info in iPort see http://www.griffintechnology.com/), installed it inside my iMac, plugged my HB in it, fired up IC and it just worked.

The iPort is not for the faint of heart: you have to disassemble your iMac in order to remove the motherboard and put the iPort under it in the really tight case. But hey, it worked and I can now ditch this crappy PC of mine...

On a completely different subject: has somebody compiled the freeware version of IC for NeXTSTEP? I have a cube and a station at home, and I was wondering if somebody ever tried this hardware with IC?
