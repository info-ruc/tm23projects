OK, attempting to answer this one now.

it is sounding to me like  you have a problem with the serial on your
6500, not a problem with the handy board.

try this.  download Zterm (a terminal emulator) from:

  http://hyperarchive.lcs.mit.edu/HyperArchive/Archive/comm/term/zterm-101.hqx

connect to the printer port (get the option by holding down the shift
key while it boots up).  then set your connection speed for 300 baud.
now, type junk on the keyboard.  does the HB's serial interface green
light flash?  if yes, then data is getting through.  if not, then
something's set up wrong on your mac, either HW or SW.

report progress and we'll take it from there.
