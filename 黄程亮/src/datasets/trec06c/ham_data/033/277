Dear all,

I asked this question before but I might have used the wrong wordings. Here I
try again.

As you all know, the HB 's motor outputs give PVM, however, it gave me problems
when I tried to amplify the power (both current and voltage.)

Is there any way I can change in the software/hardware that the motor outputs
gives constant voltages? Or, slow down the frequency of the pulses?

Thanks!

Keith
