	I am trying to determine whether the SN754410 motor drivers will support
two small DC motors. (without killing the IC's or motor)  Or will I need =
to
add a power amplification circuit.
	The motors are rated @ 6v ?A. Test show that they pull 0.35A loaded and
1.5A lock rotor.  Is this within the scope of the integrated hbridge of t=
he
Handy board or will I "release the magically smoke" from the chips?
	I have looked at the chips white papers for temp/current derating. (I fe=
el
a little lost, trying to interpret the info.) :]   I would appreciate som=
e
help in determining how to derate the chips due to temperature.
	Hitting on the same thread can anyone tell me the power rating for these
chips.

 Thanks,
