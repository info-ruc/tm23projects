Fred, I thought I found a minor mistake in the parts list for the expansion
board. But I now believe I didn't. The artwork on the schematic sold by 
Douglas shows that RP1 is a 1Kx7 where as your schematic and parts list
shows it to be a 1Kx4. Since I bought the parts locally, I used the parts
listing. I also had to cut the resistor packs since I could not find the
right length. It seems that it can be done with out a problem. 

Just thought you would like to know.
