I just saw the following:
The artwork on the schematic sold by Douglas shows that RP1 is a 1Kx7 where
as your schematic and parts list shows it to be a 1Kx4. 

Response from Douglas:
I do not know where that information came from.  
The list we (Douglas) sends out with the parts shows:
1 ea. - RP1 - 1Kx4 resistor pack.

Do you know where you got the information you are quoting?
We do not sell or supply a schematic of the board.
