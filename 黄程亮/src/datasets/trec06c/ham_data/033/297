Subject: HB bootstrap problem when U6 installed

One of my students is having a problem in assembling their HB:

Downloading and executing IC works fine _until_ U6 is installed.  After
installing U6 ('138) the GRN LED doesn't quite go off when putting the
board in bootstrap mode, it glows faintly.  And we can't download the
bootstrap.

If U6 is removed, everything is fine, the GRN LED goes off when put in
bootstrap mode, all downloading is fine.

We did have to change 6811s to get this far (original one didn't work), but
it seems solid now, but only if U6 not installed.

Any suggestions?
