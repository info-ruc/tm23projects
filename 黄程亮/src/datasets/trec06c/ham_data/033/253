Wowsa!  It appears to be time for the periodic "how to unsubscribe"
reminder.

The *only* way to unsubscribe is to send mail to Fred Martin,
fredm@media.mit.edu, asking to be removed.

All other methods have proven in the past to be futile.

Once again,

  "To unsubscribe from the Handy Board mailing list,
   you must send a request to Fred Martin (fredm@media.mit.edu) --

   he is the only one who can help you."

Whew!

Fred
