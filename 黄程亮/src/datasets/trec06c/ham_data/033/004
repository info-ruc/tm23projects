I just finished an add on for my robot that involves just that.

Radio shack used to sell the SPO256 speech syntetizer IC along with another
companion chip called the text to speech processor CTS256-AL.  To put it
simply you send it a string of characters you want spoken serially then the
chip does the rest.

The bad news is the IC are discontinued!
You might want to try to see if anybody on the newsgroups has a
CTS256-AL text to speech processor to spare,  that's how I got mine!

BG Micro used to sell both but now they only sell the SPO256 for about $5.
Get them while you can they are obsolete.

Even without the text to speech processor you can still do it but you have
to write your own software driver!

Good luck.

Is there anyway to use the I/O of the handy board to control a speech
sythesis chip.  I want to build a speech add-on to give general
feedback like "hello", "obstacle detected" and other such things has
any body tried and succeded?
