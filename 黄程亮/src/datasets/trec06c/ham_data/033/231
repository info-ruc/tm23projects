if the worst-case current is 1.5A, you're probably OK -- the
SN754410's have thermal protection for over-current conditions.

they're rated for an amp continuous, so you're not too far out of
bounds.

one cause for concern is if the 1.5A measure is done with 6V, it could
be substantially higher with the HB's 9.6v supply. but then, the motor
chips lose a couple of volts, so you're back in a happy range.
