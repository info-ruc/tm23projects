Dear Mike,
	I believe the 16 V is rms value. If you attach a capacitor
across the bridge rectifier under no load condition(output terminals are
open), the capacitor gets charged not to 16 V rms but to the maximum value
ie Vm=16*2^0.5 which is about 22 V.This could be the problem.
							Yours sincerely,
							    Nitin
