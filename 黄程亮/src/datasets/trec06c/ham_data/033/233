I had similar problems with lib_hb.c.  Downloaded it tonight (1800
local time in California, 1 Feb 99).  After removing all the "little
squares" there were still about 8 or 10 errors.  At each error I 
deleted all white space in the error's location, and then replaced
it as needed for clarity.  The very last error was the CR following
the closing curly bracket in random().  Weird!!

Now it loads properly, but haven't had a chance to check out the 
new functions.
