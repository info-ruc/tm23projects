  I have a transformer, when powered by 110 vac I get 16 vac out.
I put it through a bridge rectifier and the problem is when I put a cap say
20v 1000uf
across the +  -  of the rectifier, the voltage jumps to about 20 vdc.
If I omit the cap and attach a small dc motor I get the same effect. WHY???
Any info would be much appreciated.
