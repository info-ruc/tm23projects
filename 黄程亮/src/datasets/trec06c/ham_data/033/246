Dear Mr Fred Martin,
	I hope you remember that we in India were making a rover ,which in
the end ran into some problems.We had to present the inoperational rover
only for the exhibition. Now,after the exhibition we are trying to make
the rover work.
	We have noticed two things-7404 is not being accepted by the handy
board,this is inspite of the fact that 7404 tests fine with the digital IC
tester.
	The 74138 pins must be pulsing according to the handy board
assembly manual, but when we checked it wasn't.
	Can anybody make sense of what is going on? Please reply soon.
							Yours sincerely,
							    Nitin
