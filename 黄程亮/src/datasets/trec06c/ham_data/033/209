the buzzing indicates that the LCD isn't connected right (or is dead,
as you are guessing).

first, please be sure that all 14 pins of the LCD are inserted
properly into the LCD connector.

then (if still probs), try downloading Kent Farnsworth's replacement
pcode_hb.s19 file from:

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/software/contrib/kent/no_lcd/

this will let your handy board work properly if the LCD screen is
broken/not plugged in.
