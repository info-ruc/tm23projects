argh!@  my last email (which may arrive before this one) is in reply
to this.

repeating it in the proper context:

  yes, there was a linefeed bug in the expsens.c file in hbexplib.zip.

  it should be fixed now.  please re-download from the expansion board
  asoftware page and try again.

  let us know if this fixes the problem.  thanks a lot.
