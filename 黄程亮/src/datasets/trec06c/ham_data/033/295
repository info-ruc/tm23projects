Everyone and Fred,

Just to let everyone know, Motorola is currently doing an "End of Life"
buy on the 68HC11A family. I think the plan is that we will stop making
them by the end of the year. We are moving all customers over to the
68HC11E family.

MOTOROLA IS NOT ABOUNDING THE 68HC11 FAMILY. We are simply reducing the
number of devices in the family. The 68HC11E family is almost completely
compatible with the A family, it has more features and a lot more
customers and volume. There is an application note on moving between the
A and E family on the Motorola WWW site.

68HC11A family parts should still be available from distributors and
surplus companies for several years.
