why does the 512 bytes matter?  the HB has 32K of external ram.  i
guess if you're planning to do rom-able code development then i
understand. 

there's very little difference between the e and a series.  the port A
counter/timer pins are slightly more configurable in the e series.
also the e series has a more finicky rom bootstrap routine, making it
less compatible with the boot loaders.

ps.  FN is the package style:  52 pin PLCC.
