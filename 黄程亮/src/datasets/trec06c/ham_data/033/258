Dear Handy Board Enthusiasts:

I'm new to the Handy Board (stumbled over it about two weeks ago).  I 
understand that there are many types of 68HC11 chips--e.g., 68HC11A1FN, 
68HC11A8, 68HC11 E series, and so on.

I know that the 'A1FN is used in the design, but can others be 
substituted with minimal or no extra effort?  If so, then which chips in 
particular can be substituted.  I'm interested in using the 68HC11E1 
because of its 512 bytes of RAM.

By the way, what does the "FN" in "68HC11A1FN" signify?

Thank-you for thinking back to your "development" days and answering a 
couple of basic questions.

Steve
