ok, i think you've established that the hardware is working properly.
the fact that you can get IC to boot and talk to the board is strong
proof of that.  the zterm test demonstrates that the mac can send
chars out; the IC example proves bidirectional comms.

1.  are you certain that 6811 Downloader MCL is not working?  to test,
you'd have to drain the battery so your HB would lose its pcode, then
attempt to download pcode_hb.s19 again.  (you could also yank the ram
chip and then put it right back, which would cause it to lose state.)

the 6811 Downloader MCL wont' give you an error message (it doesn't
attempt to handshake with the board).  but if the HB has no pcode, and
you run it and then it does, you're in business.


2.  in an earlier message it sounded like the IC library load problem
might be a result of the files not being in the right place on your
hard drive, having nothing to do with communications.  what is the
precise error message/failure condition that happens with regard to
this?
