   There are several things you can use to perform your experiment.  First, 
a display will remain on the screen until a subject responds or is timed 
out, the feedback erasing the display.  In your case if you want an 
additional study interval you might need to use some branching and have a 
separate item to display it which would gather another response in order to 
have it erased when the subject is finished or timed out.  You'll probably 
need to be reprogramming the feedback between these item types (unless you 
make the negative feedback part of the item that displays the study 
interval, then you can set the DMDX negative and too long feedback to be 
blank) and also remapping response keys so the space bar can be used as a 
timed input key (if you don't use the spacebar as a request key then you 
can probably leave it mapped as a response key).  Advanced users would wind 
up using macros to perform most of the repetitive stuff.
