Hi.  My tutorial, www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language/DMDX/dmdx_tutorial.html is 
lacking designs other than lexical decision.  I can see from the questions 
that appear on this list that DMDX is being used for a lot more.  If you 
can spare the time, I would be very grateful you could mail me samples of 
the kinds of different designs for which DMDX is being used so I can add 
these to my tutorial which I will be updating over the next few weeks.  I 
will of course credit the person who wrote the design and add web links.

Thanks.

- Mike
