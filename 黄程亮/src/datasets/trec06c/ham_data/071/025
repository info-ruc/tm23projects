Hi

I reported before that I had problem to boot 3C509B-combo
ether card as a terminal.  This is an old ISA card.

Now, I have one more PC terminal from retired rhyolite CPU server,
I tried it once more using this PC, and found very very silly mistake 
of myself.

Previously, I named it as elnk3 or something, and today, I tried
it as

ether0=type=3C509

and got success.

Kenji
