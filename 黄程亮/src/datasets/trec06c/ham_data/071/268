   There are new versions of TimeDX and DMDX on the website, both version 
2.1.00.  The changes to DMDX are inconsequential, largely compiler changes 
in that I'm now using the Direct 7 SDK.  Machines with DirectX 5 installed 
should still function, however I am unable to test this as all my machines 
have Direct7 on them and reverting DirectX versions is difficult, if anyone 
gets an error please notify me -- in any event the psy1 website has 
DX7ENG.EXE on it.  The switch to version 7 is brought about by one of the 
additions to TimeDX.  TimeDX 2.1.00 rectifies the use of the refresh rate 
detection parameters in the time video mode command, changes the retrace 
rate determination code, adds the enhanced retrace rate test, deals with 
video drivers that buffer blits and flips, and fixes the tscope acid test 
"was still drawing" error.  Basically these address issues only found on 
the lastest of CPUs with the latest of video cards, and even then and 
errors were only found in TimeDX's use of the retrace tracking routines, 
DMDX's use is nowhere near as intense.
