Hi Everyone,

I want to use a photoelectric sensor with my handy-board.  The sensor require a
10 V supply voltage, while the digital inputs of the HB only supply 5 V.  Can I
simply use one of the motor outputs to supply the sensor, and plug the signal
and ground wires of the sensor in a digital input?

Also, I would like to know if there is a program readily available to send and
receive data (integers more specifically) from a PC to the handy board, and if
yes, I would like to know where I can get it.

Thanks,

Frank Payen
