Hi.

I=B4m using the servo_a7.icb file to drive a servo on my handyboard, but the
servo is not moving.    it seems that the frequentcy is not the right one
(40hz).   And I was looking for the servo.c file, because it seem easy to
use, but i can=B4t find it.

         Thanks for the help.

                         Daniel R
