I noticed in documentation on input/output with the PIO12 that the
possibility of supporting a device with 16 bit output and 8 bit input was
being considered.  Does anyone know if this has actually be developed or is
it still being considered.  I have the need for more than 8 output bits to
send condition triggers and also control an external device (a shock
generator that itself requires an 8 bit code to set shock intensity).

Thanks for any info.
