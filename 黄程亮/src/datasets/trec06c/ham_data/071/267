Hi everyone,

I'm working on a project that implies the communication of the Handy-Board
with a PC computer via the serial port.  The person who is in charge of
programming the software that will run on the PC asked me what is the
communication protocol that is supported by the Handy Board, DTR or XON/XOFF
(or both) ?   I'm not too familiar with this, can anyone help me figure it out?

Thanks,

Frank Payen
