hi.  you can certainly tap the 9.6v batt output to power the sensor
(use J13), but make *sure* that the sensor does not put out more than
5v, or you'll blow your analog inputs.

if you're not sure, put a 1K resistor in series with the sensor's
output and the HB analog input.  this might be a good idea in any
case.

re: sending data from HB to the PC, see the FAQ:
