Hello,
I am in need of some assistance please.

I am trying to have a portable omni view digital camera take compressed
mjpeg images and send them over a modem connection. To do this I believe
I would need a handy board. Another characteristic of it is that I am
trying to consume as little power as possible doing this (double AA
batteries if possible).Additionally it should only have the
computational power of doing just this mjpeg compression of images as it
will serve as the sole functionality of this operation. This is a camera
that will be posted in public areas(i.e. construction sites) and will be
able to run for about a week on low power. Do you have any idea how I
can accomplish this/ which board to get.
Please get back to me as soon as possible. Thank you very much.


-Tim
