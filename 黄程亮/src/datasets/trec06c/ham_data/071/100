   Thanks, it does.  It is in fact the method I was going to use with the 
exception of the fancy use of cos and sin.  I was going to take an initial 
guess as being the smallest interval between any of the samples, divide 
every time by it and average the errors and adjust the guess based on the 
error and repeat.  I guess the use of the vector arithmetic solves the 
initial phase uncertainty which would represent the lowest error my method 
would come up with.
