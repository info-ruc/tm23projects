Jon,

YOu may recall that DEM is holding a briefing on lessons learned from
Emmitsburg on Wednesday.  If the report is accessible to me on Tuesday,
then Wednesday could be an opportunity for me to carefully describe the
results to some key people (we have to honor the embargo, of course).  Did
you have any other ideas on when/how to give accurate numbers to the
Governors office and DEM?

I have a somewhat different take on the results than you do.  Having had
the opportunity to look carefully at the tables with average loss and loss
ratio, it appears that the loss ratio follows the seismic hazard fairly
closely - those places with the highest hazard have the highest loss ratio
- with a modifier that those places with more development at risk tend to
have increased loss ratio.  This would suggest that in the highest
rankings, the relative rankings may be more reliable than the actual loss
numbers themselves.

You suggest that this is an opportunity to make the case for more funding.
I agree, but we should be prepared to make the case that with more funding
we can actually help to reduce the risk.  That is actually not easy.
I think we should have a list of specific actions that seem to us to be
appropriate.  A couple of obvious ones: Las Vegas shows up with a higher
average loss than Reno.   We've been saying for years that we need a
state-funded technician and that if we had that we would be better able to
operate a decent network around Las Vegas.  We've also argued that an
office in Las Vegas would help, and have been consistently ignored in that
also.  A second obvious issue is a need for a neotectonic
geologist to better map and quantify the active faults.  In loss ratio,
Reno is much higher than Las Vegas, of course, but we should anticipate
the potential for some calls from Las Vegas, and thus the need to take a
little time to brief some of our safety council members down there.

We should have more ideas by Tuesday meeting.

John
