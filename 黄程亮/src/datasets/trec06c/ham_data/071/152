TO: The Earthquake Community at UNR

Depending on how big of a deal FEMA wants to make with its press release
regarding its forthcoming HAZUS report on average annual loss from
earthquakes in the United States, we may get lots of calls at UNR regarding
this.  Craig dePolo and I will be at the Seattle meeting when the report is
released on September 20, and John Anderson will be in transit from the
SCEC meeting to the Seattle meeting that day.  Therefore some of the press
questions may come to others.   Below I include some of the key points that
I will make if asked.

>From my perspective the most important point for us to stress regarding
FEMA's HAZUS work is that EARTHQUAKE HAZARDS ARE SIGNIFICANT IN NEVADA.   I
assume that the report will have numbers that are similar to earlier
versions that we have seen - something on the order of $50 million per year
as an estimate of the average annualized loss from earthquakes for
residential and commercial buildings in Nevada.  A direct hit in one of our
urban areas could easily exceed $1 billion in economic losses.

In my note to the other State Geologists and to the State Emergency
Management Directors (see below) I tried to alert them to some of the
concerns we have had about the HAZUS results.  In particular, we need to be
careful not to put too much emphasis on Nevada's rankings relative to other
states.   

Ron Hess and Craig dePolo at NBMG and Feng Su in the Seismo Lab have some
experience running HAZUS for scenarios.  We have not had the resources to
update the FEMA files to include local geological conditions.  This means
that the results for Nevada (which will be heavily weighted in terms of
dollar losses to the Reno-Carson City and Las Vegas Valley urban areas) use
FEMA's default soil conditions for attenuation functions and could be
substantially improved.  Further fault studies, geologic mapping, seismic
research, engineering measurements of soil conditions, geodetic monitoring,
and neotectonic modeling will likely improve the probabilistic seismic
hazard maps and attenuation data that feed into HAZUS calculations.
Working with local building and taxation/assessment authorities could
substantially improve the building-stock data in the HAZUS program as well.

We are doing quite a bit in Nevada with geological, seismological, and
engineering research at the University of Nevada, Reno and with several
activities of the Nevada Earthquake Safety Council (scenarios, emergency
response and recovery exercises, training for building inspectors,
guidelines for professional practice, K-12 school activities, and maps,
brochures, and reports for the general public).  But MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE
DONE.

The release of this HAZUS loss-estimation report for earthquakes in the
United States provides us with an excellent opportunity to demonstrate the
need for support of earthquake programs.  We could use this report in
support of federal funding for the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction
Program, the USGS's Advance National Seismic System and the National
Cooperative Geologic Mapping Program, NSF's Earthscope and its components
that are most significant for Nevada (Plate Boundary Observatory, U.S.
Array, and InSAR), NSF's support for earthquake engineering and science
research centers, and State support for NBMG, the Seismological Laboratory,
academic programs in geosciences and engineering at UNR and UNLV, and the
Nevada Earthquake Safety Council.

Thanks for your help, should you be asked to comment about the significance
of the FEMA report.

>As you probably are aware, Stu Nishenko with FEMA has been working for
some time on a report that will present a state-by-state and national
perspective of anticipated dollar losses from earthquakes using HAZUS.
HAZUS is FEMA's computer model for estimating losses from earthquakes (and
eventually wind and flood hazards).  Stu told me this morning at a National
Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program strategic planning meeting that his
annualized loss-estimation report is scheduled to be released by Mike
Armstrong, FEMA's Assistant Director for Mitigation, during his speech on
Wednesday morning, September 20, at the National Earthquake Risk Mitigation
Conference in Seattle.
>
>In discussions over the last couple of years with the WSSPC Board of
Directors and the AASG Hazards Committee, Mike and Stu had promised that
they would give State Geologists and State Emergency Management Directors
opportunities to see the report before it is released, so that we are
prepared to answer questions from the press and so that we can brief our
bosses (including Governors) about the implications of the report's numbers
prior to their seeing the results in the newspaper.
>
>Early next week Stu plans to send us an e-mail with instructions on how we
can access the pre-release, embargoed version of the report via the Web.
PLEASE BE SURE TO HONOR THE EMBARGO.  That is, don't make any public
release of the information until after 10:00 a.m. on Wednesday, September
20, or whatever time Stu puts on his message to us.
>
>I suggest that you and others on your staff who are involved in earthquake
programs and issues read the report or at least its executive summary.
>
>As I understand the HAZUS model, its calculations should be viewed as
order-of-magnitude approximations.  Although calibrations and checks using
the Loma Prieta (1989) and Northridge (1994) earthquakes produce results
that are within a factor of two of the real losses, the HAZUS program
contains a number of assumptions about geological conditions and the value
and type of buildings throughout the United States.  The estimated numbers
could thus be off by a factor of ten.  It is therefore not wise to
emphasize the difference between one state's estimated annualized loss from
earthquakes of, say, $70 million, and another state's value of $200 million
or $20 million.  With additional work to include local geological and soil
conditions, rather than the default values used by HAZUS, and better
information on the local building stock, the uncertainty in the numbers can
be reduced considerably.  Nonetheless, the HAZUS annualized loss estimation
is a good model that produces as reasonable national figure using a
standardized methodology and consistent building inventory.  Caution should
be used when discussing the numbers at the state or local level. 
>
>In any communications that you have with the press and others, I suggest
that you also keep in mind that HAZUS results include estimated damage to
residential and commercial buildings, but they do not include losses to
lifelines (roads, bridges, power systems, water and sewage systems, etc.)
or economic impacts from loss of business, unemployment, and other factors.
 That is, the HAZUS numbers are likely to be minimum estimates of total
economic impacts from earthquakes.
>
>Another point to remember in using the report's numbers is that the basic
input for HAZUS is the probabilistic seismic hazard analysis of the U.S.
Geological Survey (their NEHRP provisions that also fed into the 2000
International Building Code).  For many parts of the country this
probabilistic approach shows a best estimate of expected annual loss, but
it does not show a worst-case scenario or even a likely scenario.  For
example, a state with an average annual loss of, say, $10 million, might
experience a significant earthquake only once every 100 years.  Although
this might imply that the one event would cost $1 billion (100 x $10
million), the cost may in reality be considerably higher.  FEMA's report
presents estimated annualized losses calculated from a long-term average
estimate.  The actual loss in any given year may be larger or smaller than
this long-term average value.
>
>As an aside, one of the powerful aspects of HAZUS is that it can be run
for a scenario earthquake, that is, to estimate loss from a single likely
event in one urban area.  
>
>The Board of Directors of the Western States Seismic Policy Council, which
includes four State Emergency Management Directors and three State
Geologists, has offered to review any press information that FEMA plans to
include with its release of the report.  We expect Stu to get this
information to us as soon as he can.
>
>I would like to thank Stu, Mike, and Craig Wingo for their following
through on our requests to see the report prior to its release.  I believe
that we have a great opportunity to capitalize on the report for the
benefit of our state programs and our citizens.
