 Hi, 
I am trying to use the 100 step motor code and a Hb expansion board.
I can get either one of them to work ALONE ONLY.
So I can only use the expansion board. OR the 100 step pcode,
How do I install both so they dont conflict with one another.
Any help with this would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks
-Mike
