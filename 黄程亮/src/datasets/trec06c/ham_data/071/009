   I've changed the DMDX listserv subject filter, hopefully we'll not be 
getting posts with blank subject lines anymore.  However there was an odd 
piece of code in there that had to get snipped that I can't for life of me 
figure out what it was for (that whole program didn't rank high enough to 
get comments), no doubt after a few posts we'll find out what it was for...
