Sure.. hey I thought I replied to the list.

Here's the picture so far.. note: lugenet doesn't allow jpeg attachments
so
You will get the image, lugenet will reject them.
I am hoping to put up a webpage soon.  I've got a few sensors I am
designing
from scratch, a quad infrared for the sensor array, if it works the
sensor array should
be able to track the movement of a living object.. like a hand.  I may
have it
track light as well.  It's great to have so many ADC ports at my
disposal!
Also I am working on a Freequency to Voltage converter so the handyboard

can "hear" music.  It will be funny to see the head bopping up and down
to a beat
to some tunes.  I think it can be pulled off with some preprocessing.
I'm reading up
now on converting frequency to voltage.  The voltage will vary with
frequency input.
It also looks like I can use:

Y3  5000 - 5FFF Read
Y4 6000-6FFF Write
Y5 6000-6FFF  Read
And  DIG8 is available

I Wish I had 2 write enebles available.. but I don't
I Think it's possible to add some glue logic with the
DIG8 Signal and Y4 to squeeze another Write enable port.
I'll just have to write some low level code.

That would give me access to  two devices:
I was going to wire wrap a Digitalker Synthesizer
and with some additional glue logic I can add memory!
Am I dreaming?  I looked at the HB Expansion schematic
and the HB schematic.. these signal lines look available.
Can anyone verify this?
