   Shouldn't think extra keys would make a difference.  Meaning you can't 
use the Input Test when Keyboard is highlighted and you press the test 
button?  Doesn't do that on my machines and testing on Friday didn't turn 
up anything.  How can you see the key list if you get a SetCooperativeFail 
message?  Does the original code still work?  If you don't have it the 
website still has a DMDX13something on it.  Sounds like DirectInput is 
broken on your machine, SetCooperativeLevel is about as ancient as DirectX 
function calls get.
