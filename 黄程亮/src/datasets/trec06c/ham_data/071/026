Hi,

I am assisting a Robotics course with the venerable HandyBoard, and have 
been having the same problem with the Toshiba, and ThinkPad laptops. With 
Toshiba though, there is no infrared as far as I can tell, and I can run and 
load the inital pcode with HBDL, through the only port, which is COM1. But 
when it comes to IC, I get an error saying

' Synchronizing with the board '
' Board Not Responding '

One of my students brought a ThinkPad, and we couldn't get that to work 
either, now I know why..

Any input about the Toshiba is appreciated though..
