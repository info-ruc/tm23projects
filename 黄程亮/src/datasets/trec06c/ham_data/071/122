Whew. I have encountered the same problem back when I wanted the improved
PWM code in the new version of IC. Back then (about 2 years ago) I managed
to find someone who actually had a copy of the 3.1 pcode. Don't ask me for
it, I lost it long ago.
  My general take is that development on the commercial version of
Interactive C halted a long time ago. The windows version and the mac
version are wildly out of sync with each other (the mac version is much,
much better). No updates have been released in a couple of years and it
looks like their Arc C development environment is getting all the resources
in house as it is used on some of the hardware they sell. My pet peeve at
the time was that the UI on windows was substandard and I wanted to donate
my time to make it a little better. I too heard nothing from Newton Labs,
only validating my belief that development was halted.
  What are we to do? Newton Labs is a commercial company, it is in their
right to sell product they are no longer actively developing. Its also their
right to keep the source code.
  I originally bought v3.1 because
1) It had a UI.
2) It supported multidimensional arrays.
3) It supported defines.

I've often been tempted to start adding some of these things to the v2.8
source thats out there, but every time i look at the code I get discouraged.
There are no real build instructions for all platforms, nor projects to get
things started. If anyone has the time, maybe something should get started
at Sourceforge.net? I'm not really using my handyboard that much anymore, so
I don't have an itch to scratch.
good luck,
  chris prosser
