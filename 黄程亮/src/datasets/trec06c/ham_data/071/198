Hi I am a fellow student that needs help doing a calculus math problem 
dealing with functions. I dont know if u can help me or not but here is the 
question :
Can u think of two functions whose domains exist in the real numbers but 
whose composition has no domain in the real numbers. Do two such functions 
exist at all? Is it even possible for a function to have no domain at all? In 
other words, no x-values work? Remember, two functions have two compositons. 
Thank you for ur help. Please answer as soon as possible.  Thanks again.
