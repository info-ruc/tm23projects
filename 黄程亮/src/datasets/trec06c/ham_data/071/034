   Sorry that reply was meant to be longer, in trying to check what the 
help files actually say on the subject I've discovered that the home 
machine's configuration goes through TimeDX like a dose of salts, can't 
time a video mode for love nor money.  Bugger, more work to do there.  In 
any event I remember put tons of stuff in the help files somewhere about 
all the enhanced vox stuff, perhaps you've wound up with the old help 
files?  Especially seeing as I remember removing all sorts of refernces to 
the vox button as it's no longer there.
