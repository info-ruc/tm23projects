Hi

You can only run the counter 4x slower as now. But in this case, the complete
HB works 4x times slower, so this isn't a usefull solution.

The other possibility is the use the overflow flag and integers. I didn't solve
that problem. For more information look at the pink book from Motorola.

Bye

Martin
