CALL FOR PAPERS 
                            
    International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation
              University of Western Ontario, Canada, 
                      July 22-25, 2001
    
              XXXX://www.orcca.on.ca/issac2001/

ISSAC is the yearly premier international symposium in Symbolic and
Algebraic Computation that provides an opportunity to learn of new
developments and to present original research results in all areas 
of symbolic mathematical computation. ISSAC'2001 will be locally 
hosted by the University of Western Ontario at London and the Ontario 
Research Centre for Computer Algebra (ORCCA).

                               Important dates

         Before January 15, 2001      Submission to the Program
                                      Committee Chair deadline
         March 12, 2001               Notification of acceptance
         April 2, 2001                Camera -ready copy received

Original research results and insightful analyses of current concerns 
are solicited for submission. Papers will be reviewed by a program 
committee and referees. Survey articles may be suitable for submission 
if identified as such, they will be considered in a separate category 
from the research papers. Proceedings will be distributed at the 
symposium. Electronic submission is encouraged.

           Program Committee Chair:  Gilles.Villard@ens-lyon.fr


Conference Topics:

Topics of the meeting include, but are not limited to,

  Algorithmic mathematics.  Algebraic, symbolic and symbolic-numeric
algorithms. Simplification, function manipulation, equations,
summation, integration, ODE/PDE, linear algebra, number theory, group
and geometric computing.

  Computer Science. Theoretical and practical problems in symbolic
computation. Systems, problem solving environments, user interfaces,
softwares, libraries, parallel/distributed computing and programming 
languages for symbolic computation, concrete analysis, benchmarking, 
complexity of computer algebra algorithms, automatic differentiation, 
code generation, mathematical data structures and exchange protocols.

  Applications. Problem treatments using algebraic, symbolic or
symbolic-numeric computation in an essential or a novel way.
Engineering, economics and finance, physical and biological sciences,
computer science, logic, mathematics, statistics, education.

Program Committee:

 Chair: Gilles Villard, CNRS IMAG Grenoble, 
                              Gilles.Villard@ens-lyon.fr

Proceedings Editor: Bernard Mourrain, INRIA Sophia Antipolis,
                                       mourrain@sophia.inria.fr

Submissions must not substantially duplicate work published 
or submitted for publication elsewhere. Late submissions will 
be rejected.

Best student author award. 

This award will be given to the best student author. An author 
is eligible if full-time student at the time of submission, this 
should be indicated.

Notification. 

Authors will be sent notification of acceptance or rejection by 
e-mail on or before March 12, 2001. A final copy of each accepted 
paper will be required by April 2, 2001. This is again a firm 
deadline. An author of each accepted paper must attend the Conference 
and present the paper, or make arrangements to have it presented.

Preparing final versions. 

Formatting requirements will be based  on the ACM Proceedings 
Templates, for instance in LaTeX2e you should use the
acm_proc_article-sp.cls document class file to format your document.
