Hi.

I am using the following rtf to present backwardly masked bitmaps to 
participants on a slave computer.

<id "rawjoystick"> <nfb> <dbc 0> <dwc 000255000> <vm 800,600,600,16,0>
! This vm provides 4 memory buffers.
0 ;
0 g "4e" %2 / g "4a" %59 /;
0 g "6a" %2 / g "6a" %59 /;
! etc. Continues for 58 subsequent trials.
0 "The End.  Thank you for your participation.";

The slave receives a TTL signal through the games port from a master 
computer that is running VPM. VPM is being used to deliver acoustic startle 
probes, and record physiological signals (eg, EEG, facial EMG & HR).

The problem I have encountered is that there is an inconsistent delay 
between the receiving of the request (TTL, or keyboard activated on slave) 
and the presentation of the bitmaps. The inconsistent delay makes it 
impossible to time acoustic probes from the master computer. Preparation A 
for bitmaps vary between .10 to 1500ms, whereas preparation B is steady 
between 40 and 50ms. I'm presuming that Prep A relates to the loading of 
the *.bmp files, and hence is processor intensive.

If anyone is aware of how to make this delay relatively constant (i.e., 
Prep A), or how to reduce it to a minimum, I'd appreciate it if you would 
let me know. It may be necessary to establish a feedback signal from the 
slave to the master PC, but I am unsure of DMDX's ability in this area, and 
would like some advice.

Best Regards,

Julian Simmons.
