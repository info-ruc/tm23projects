Hi,

I have a question.  Does the sonar implementation that's suggested
prohibit
you from adding additional devices to the SPI bus?  I know you can add
as many SPI
devices as you have enable lines.     I'd like to add sonar, compass,
and RTC / battery monitor
to the SPI bus.     The compass is a read only device, but the RTC is
r/w
Anyway any ideas?
