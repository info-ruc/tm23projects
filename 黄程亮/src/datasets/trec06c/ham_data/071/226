Hello,

I work with a Handy Board and an other board based on 68hc11E2.
The first is master and the second is slave.

The SPI communication is OK between 2 boards.

The first send the position of servos to the second.

At the start, all is OK.

After 2 minutes or 3 minutes , the 68hc11e2 stop to send the rectangular
signal to servos and after that, the SPI communication stop.

If one person can help me !

The problem can come to the 2 rti on the 68hc11E2 ?
The problem can come to the SPI ?
The problem can come on interference of power supply ?
The problem can come to the stack/pointer ?

Bye

Thierry
