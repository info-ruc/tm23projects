   You'd be the first person to notice it.  If you suspect there are visual 
anomalies then change the display presentation rates, slow each frame down 
to a couple of seconds and scrutinize them, when DMDX generates the images 
there is no knowledge of display rates.  I guess if you were using a 256 
color display mode the palette could _concievably_ change between frames, 
DMDX exerts no control over the palette and GDI could be doing something 
weird but I'd be really surprised, when frames are presented GDI is 
completely out of the picture.
