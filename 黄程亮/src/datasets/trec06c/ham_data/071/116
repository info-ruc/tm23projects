George Musser brought up a very good issue! Where the heck is
pcode_hb.asm?
This code was released in ver 2.86 and enhancements were made to the
pcode
from the user base.  Newton Labs has tunnel vision and NO CLUE to how
open source software can evolve.  I did a find under the directory where
I installed
IC 3.1 on my linux box and  indeed did not have the source to
pcode_hb.s19.
I bought 3.1 as my way of Supporting Interactive C.  What a joke, I
should
have stayed with 2.86,  if not having the source to code bothers you,
and Newton Labs doesn't see the light, I recommend sticking with
the free version of Interactive C, at least we can add to pcode if we
wish to.
If you purchase 3.1 and want to add functionality.. you
can't!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I don't know if Fred can help us.  I thought I'd get the source to
pcode_hb.asm
since it was included with the Free version.

We can always disassemble the code, but it would be easier to add to if
we
have the labels and comments in the code.

What's up with Newton Labs?  Gee we can use the enhanced 2.86 for free,
you decide to support them by purchasing a copy and they don't give you
the latest source,  they have no clue.

I sent them an email stating if they don't want to release the pcode
then
I want a refund and I will stick with 2.86
