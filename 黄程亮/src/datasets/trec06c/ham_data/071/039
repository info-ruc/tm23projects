Hi all,

This mail is being sent to the toolkit course mailing list (that is, only
people who were officially registered for the class).  Due to our
department's computer systems shutdown, I have not been able to receive the
registration surveys yet.  If you know someone who is in the class but not
on the registration list, please forward this message to them.

o Room

Class has been moved to Olsson 120.

o Registration Survey

Because the CS department servers will down all day yesterday,
many of you were not able to access the registration survey.
I will accept registration surveys until 11:59pm Sunday.

o Problem Set 1 Clarifications

3d. As in question 3c, you may assume the wheels are known.  If you can
extend your attack for the case where the wheels are not known, then
you are ready to try it out on the challenge problem.

3e. "always choose either the 3rd line above" should be "always choose
the 3rd line above".

Monday's lecture will include information that will help with question 2
and 4.  I encourage you to try them and start thinking about them now,
but be aware that I will cover topics Monday (that aren't in the assigned
reading) that will relate to these problems.

Best,

--- Dave
