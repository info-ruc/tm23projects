   Ok, makes sense, I enumerate the keys before acquiring the device.

   Gameport devices are polled so it's a different code path.  I suspect 
you may want to try re-installing DirectX 7 and generally perturbing the 
state of your machine by deleting interesting things in the device manager, 
like the keyboard, windows will re-detect it next time it boots. I have run 
TimeDX 2.1.00 on at least 4 quite different machines now and see no 
evidence of your problem -- but they're all '98 DX7 machines, maybe there's 
a '95 DX7 issue here.  Anyone else tested 2.1.00 out yet?
