As far as drawterm is concerned, 
the latest update had patches to 
make drawterm work under FreeBSD
using the Posix thread library.

The Linux drawterm will not work
in most other places, even under 
binary emulation, because it depends
on the task segment selector as
a unique thread id.  This is the same
reason that the Inferno Linux binaries
don't work under other OSes with
Linux binary emulation.
