Hello Jerry,
Did not get the picture of the Mars Rover.
Sounds like you have a good start on your robot, please keep us advised on
the problems and solutions.
Was it hard to convert the mice encoders?? should be very accurate, please
post the hook-up and details.
Keep up the good work!!!
Terry Gathright
