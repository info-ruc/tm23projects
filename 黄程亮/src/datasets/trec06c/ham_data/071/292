Hi,
We are looking for part-time help entering calculus solutions for a new 
educational website.  I hope that you will review the following ad and either 
follow up yourself or pass this along to someone you know who might be 
interested.
Thank you,
Chuck Grant

CALCULUS SOLUTION AUTHORS
Internet startup seeks work-at-home contractors to input solutions to 
first-year calculus problems that we provide. 

Creating the solutions involves "teaching" or "tutoring" how to do the 
problems by providing hints and asking helpful questions.  We provide the 
format for inputting these solutions, which must be done in WORD 97 (or 
later) with Equation Editor 3.0.

Qualifications: You must have experience teaching or tutoring in calculus.  
You must be able to break up a problem into the appropriate "steps" and write 
clear, concise explanations.  You must be able to appreciate the context of a 
problem by reading the lesson that the problem is associated with, so that 
your solutions are pertinent to that particular lesson, and not use 
techniques taught later on.  Good English skills are a MUST.

Pay starts at $15 per hour.  Long-term authors may receive stock options.  
You must be available for at least 6 months and want to work at least 15 
hours per week (there is no maximum).   Promotion to higher-paid editor or 
managing editor positions could occur quickly for suitable applicants.  
Please submit a brief resume showing math education and teaching/tutoring 
experience to p_hamati@hotmail.com.  You will be sent a brief qualification 
test as the next step.
