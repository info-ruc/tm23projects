Hi,

I wonder whether anyone out there can offer any advice.  In an 
experiment we are presenting the same bmp picture twice at the 
same time, one just to the left and one just to the right of the 
centre.  Anyway we noticed that the images looked different 
although they are generated from the same bmp.  We are sure this 
is just a visual illusion but so many people reported the effect 
that we just wanted to check there is no way dmdx could in some 
way produce slightly different images form the same source?

Thanks for any comments
Emma
