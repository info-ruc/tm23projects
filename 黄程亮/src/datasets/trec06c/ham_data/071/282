Subject: Sonar and Compass together on expansion board.

          I am working in adapting a PNI compass to the handyboard.
And I have a 6500 sonar board
connected to the expansion board, here's my idea:
Use a Lithium 3.6V battery to save calibration settings after poweroff
M/S is jumper selectable
Calibrate is Jumper Selectable
Raw is jumper Selectable
P/C goes to a data out port, that way we can either poll or go into
continous mode.
SDO goes to MISO
SDI goes to   MOSI
SCK to SCLK
Enable goes to a Data Out.

NOW, to fix the shortage of  Data Out I am going to use a few three to
8-decoders to increase my
"Enable" lines.  So we can get  more lines that way, my IRPD that needs
to fire off 8 Infrared LEDs
needs ro tie up three + lines ( I don't now If I am going to use some
logic to decode the state that
all three lines are low to light the 1st LED, or use the next led port..

Don't know what is best yet.
I thnk the clock  that drives BINH won't be a problem because it's a
blanking signal to the sonar, we
just don't ping the sonar when we clock out data from the compass.  And
when we are done we
disable the compass and start pinging again.   Does this make sense, Am
I looking at this right?
Thanks!
