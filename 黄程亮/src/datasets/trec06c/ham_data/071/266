I have recently (in the past 2 days) downloaded DMDX and TimeDX.  In running
the initial tests on TimeDX my system is freezing on the Refresh screen.
This sometimes means a reboot of the entire system. Is this a problem with
my system (office 97) or with the program. I had no problem with the previous
versions.
