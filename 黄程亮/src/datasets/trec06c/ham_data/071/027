Was wondering the current method for setting threshold value for response
using digitalVOX.  Help files talk of VOX button in main DMDX dialog box,
but I am guessing this is out of date as I don't see any such button.
Couldn't find anything in TimeDX.  Noticed that there has been much work on
digitalVOX recently but couldn't find reference to new method for threshold
setting in the listserv archive.  Any lead would be appreciated.

Thanks
John
