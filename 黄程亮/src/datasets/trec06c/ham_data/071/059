   Any math wizard out there know of someone's algorithm to determine the 
frequency of a signal given the times of a number of not necessarily 
consecutive samples?  I'm thinking of retrograding version 2 back to 
version 1's retrace rate determination code, or doing some sort of blend of 
the two.  The trouble with version 1's method of noting the time that 
retraces occur at is that it misses a number of them, just what percentage 
depends on the machine and phase of the moon -- it has a number of kludges 
in there that get it right the vast majority of times, however it's by no 
means 100%, fortunately (or unfortunately, depends which view you take, if 
it repeatedly screwed up I'd have done something about it) repeating the 
test is very likely to not repeat any error.  The trouble with version 2's 
approach, to perform a given number of flips and note how long they all 
took is that on some machines, notably ones with NVIDIA video cards using 
Detonator 3 drivers and possibly whatever cards Mike has been having 
trouble with, is that a constant (it would appear) number of frames can get 
added into the mix, it appears to be 2 frames, so using 100 flips actually 
gets 102 which is what I suspect gives me a consistent retrace interval of 
12.00ms when it should be 11.75, 200 flips gives half the error again, 10x 
the flips 1 tenth the error indicating a constant number of extra 
frames.  Which would be fine if it did it on everybody's video cards, but 
it doesn't, the reason the code is the way it is is that it works on every 
other machine I've tested it on.
   So either someone comes up with a wondrous formula that solves this 
conundrum or I put another kludge in there.  Which of course does nothing 
for the more scary part of the problem and that is that the existing 
retrace sync routines also seem to get blown out of the water by these 
stinking drivers too, 98% multiply missed retraces is pretty impressive 
when I've overridden the automatic values and entered correct ones.  They 
get out of phase and don't get back in phase which makes me think that the 
driver is just point blank not telling me when the vertical retrace is 
occurring.  All I can hope for is that there is some obvious error I've 
made but I'm having trouble believing that, the code works with other drivers.
