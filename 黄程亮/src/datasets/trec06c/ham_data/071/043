   Man, what a frustrating morning.  It looks like the root of the trouble 
with my machines at home is the latest NVIDIA drivers, the so called 
Detonator 3 drivers, version number 618.  For some reason TimeDX just can't 
cope with them, they are doing too many illegal things in order for the 
benchmarks to look good.  The other machine at home with an 85Hz display 
was locking onto the retrace perfectly with the old drivers reporting 
refresh intervals of 11.75ms, exactly correct.  Installed the new 618 
drivers and all hell breaks loose, instead of consistently reporting longer 
retrace intervals like this machine does (this one likes the value 12.00 
unless you time things for excessively long intervals and then it drops 
back to 11.8 or so) the other machine reports short intervals, like 11.6 or 
so.  Worse, the code that I just put in to aggressively combat cheating 
drivers does nothing on that box, at least on this one it stops the code 
that detects cheating from detecting it (doesn't actually change anything 
else though).  Guess there's one further level of anti-cheating that I can 
employ but it's basically my software battling theirs.  This sucks.
