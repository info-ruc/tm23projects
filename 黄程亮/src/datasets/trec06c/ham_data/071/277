    There does seem to be a problem with the new update when used with machines
with DirectX 5  -- when using TimeDx, the keyboard is no longer recognized
("SetCooperativeFail"; "The function called is not supported at this time"),
nor is my mouse.  Installing Direct X 7.0 made no difference:  I still can't
get the keyboard to be recognized in TimeDx (nor a mouse).  Perhaps the problem
is related to the fact that there are keys listed in the key list that few
people would have on their keyboard (e.g. "Webstop", "MyComputer")?

    Thanks for the update.  I downloaded and installed the previous version
hours before the new version went online (my first experience with DmDx).  I
experienced all of the video problems you mention above, and all of them were
fixed in the update!  Talk about a coincidence!  Now if I could get an input
device to work again I would be in great shape :)
