We've recorded auditory ERPs with Neuroscan triggered by DMDX, and noticed
that the N100 is peaking between 30 and 50 Msec... Since this is a virtual
physiological impossibility, it seems most likely that our code is causing
the audio file to be played before the trigger is delivered to the PIO 12.
Can anyone tell me how to present the WAV files so that they are presented
exactly simultaneously with the trigger?

thanks,

JK
