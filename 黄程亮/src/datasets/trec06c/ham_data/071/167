I have read the FAQ on cutting the trace that supplies motor power from the
Handyboard battery so you can use another power source but it doesn't address
the issue of what to do if you have an expansion board. I am sure someone must
have done this before so if anyone knows how to use external battery power for
the motors while the expansion board is being used please advise me.
Thank You,
John
