Just getting set up (been an assistant prof for about 3 weeks now), so I
don't have a huge budget.  However, I would be willing to pay what I can if
that would make that revision happen.  I have been a user of VPM (software
by Ed Cook at U of Birmingham) for many years as a grad student.  VPM is a
set of assembly language macros and as such provides nice low level control
of hardware such as IO boards.  Downside was that it was difficult to teach
others to code in it.  Hoping to switch to a package like DMDX which
provides improved stimulus presentation routines (VPM was initially designed
for psychophysiological data collection, not stim display) but is easier to
train my students to use.  To really make the switch though, I need to be
able to have better control over additional external devices.  Let me know
what your thoughts are.  Feel free to email me directly and we can talk
more.

Thanks for your time.
John

   No, it hasn't been done yet.  What's it worth to you?
