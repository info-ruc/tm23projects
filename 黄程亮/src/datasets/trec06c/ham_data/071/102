Subject: Pcode source code; disabling the LCD

Hi all,

Does anyone have a copy of the pcode source for IC 3.1?  According to an 
earlier posting, it used to be available on the Newton Labs FTP site, but 
it's not there anymore.

Also, has anyone ever completely disabled their LCD?  Even after the 
system_print_off() function has been called, the 1 kHz system interrupt 
routine continues to send certain commands to the LCD, tying up the CPU and 
generating a horrid 1 kHz electrical noise that interferes with my RF link.  
I've studied the pcode source for IC 2.8, but I can't figure out why the 
interrupt routine still feels it necessary to communicate with the LCD even 
when system printing should be disabled.  I managed to truly disable the LCD 
by judicious hacking, but I'm wondering what other people's experience is.

Best wishes,
George Musser
