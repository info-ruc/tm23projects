Subject: IR transmission
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

What value resistor should I put in series with the IR led for transmitting from
the hb ?. The red led that is present as an indicator is rated for about 5mA (I
think they normally run at about 2-3mA) using a 1K resistor (R5) so should I run
the IR led using a 1K resistor at about 3-5 mA ?. Does any body know what sort
of current IR handsets normally use ?, the specs for all the leds that I have
quote outputs with a current of 100mA which I think is a little high but I
assume it is to provide a common reference value not a recommended current.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks
