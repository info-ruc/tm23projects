    When I use the Input Test for the keyboard I get a list of keys in the window
below, and then immediately thereafter the error message I noted above
("SetCooperativeFail"; "The function called is not supported at this time").
When I attempt to use the keyboard as an input device in a script I get the same
error message.  This error did not occur with the previous version of DMDX using
DirectX 5.0.  The reason I suspected it had something to do with the extra keys
is that these keys were not listed in the input window in the previous version of
DMDX.  Perhaps I need to re-install DirectX 7.0, and/or the keyboard device
driver, or perhaps this problem is just unique to my machine.  In any event, I
*can* get a gameport device to function, and the latest version of the program
solves all of the video problems I was having with the previous version, so I am
happy.
