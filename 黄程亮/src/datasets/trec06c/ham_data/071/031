The Help files that I have for DMDX were last updated on 8-17-00.  If it
helps for future Help revisions, the mention of the VOX button in DMDX is in
the DMDX help file in the module titled Digital VOX calibration.

Thanks for the assistance.

   Sorry that reply was meant to be longer, in trying to check what the
help files actually say on the subject I've discovered that the home
machine's configuration goes through TimeDX like a dose of salts, can't
time a video mode for love nor money.  Bugger, more work to do there.  In
any event I remember put tons of stuff in the help files somewhere about
all the enhanced vox stuff, perhaps you've wound up with the old help
files?  Especially seeing as I remember removing all sorts of refernces to
the vox button as it's no longer there.
