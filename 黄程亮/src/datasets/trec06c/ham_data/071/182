Since some are on the subject of encoders, I have a problem I would like to
get help on.  I have a hall effect sensor dutifully counting pulses on a
gear.  The gear will rotate from 800-4000 RPM.  I am running the signal
through a 741 OP Amp to condition and amplify.  I get a beautiful square wave
output to my analog input on the handy board.  The test signal is a 35.3 ms
rep rate or 1730 RPM, but the handy board does not keep a good count.  I am
using fencdr5.icb.  Hi and low thresholds are at 220 and 110 respectively.
This problem is driving me nuts.  Any help?
