I am putting together an n-back experiment and had a quick question for the
list.
I need to present a series of letters, record responses to each letters
(button press) and present the next letter in the series a fixed interval
after the offset of the previous letter.

Basically a block of trials needs to have this timing


letter  (500 ms)
response window (2000 ms)
letter (500 ms)
response window (2000 ms)
.
.
.
etc.


It seems that I can specify a minimum time between letters by including a
blank frame.  However, this would lead to a total time between letters that
varies based on the participant's RT (equal to blank frame duration + RT).
Does anyone know how I can code the trials so that the time between each
letter presentation is fixed (regardless of how long the RT to the letter
is?)

Thank you for any suggestions.
