Hello Jerry-

Why not build a dual-range system so that when you need the extra
accuracy
you run the timer at full tilt and when you just want the extended range

you cut the timer in half? I suspect that knowing that you're 6.5 inches

away from something is a lot more important than knowing that you're 414

inches (34.55 feet) away...... yes? Another thing you could do, if the
extended range -and- accuracy are important is to delay starting the
counter (or taking your initial reading, or whatever) until "15 feet"
worth
of time has past- and then turn on the counter. You should get the same
accuracy your 15 foot system gives you over the _second_ fifteen foot
range. You just can't do both at the same time, which isn't really an
issue
anyway....

I would like to see your pictures. Just send them to the email address
above. If you would like to see some of my efforts, look at
http://www.wizard.org. I don't have any photos of my latest project
(Gadget-II) up yet but you may enjoy my last project (Gadget).


Good luck on your project!
