Here's a reply from one of our resident wizards. 

Hope this helps.

Dear DMDXers

There is a 'circle wrapping' technique which works well with this kind 
of problem which has been described as a form of 'hunting for quanta'.

Suppose there are K events. Let t(i) be the time at which event i 
occurs (i = 1, ..., K). We assume that the events are a subset of an 
isochronous spaced sequence which occur at times {c+d, c+2d, c+3d, ...} 
for some constants c (phase offset) and d (base period). So t(i) = c + 
n(i).d + error for some sequence of integers {n(1), n(2), n(3), ..., 
n(K)}.

Imagine a long piece of thread with knots at the points t(i). Wrap the 
thread round a reel with circumference D and see whether the knots tend 
to collect at one place. If they do then D is probably equal to d or a 
submultiple d/N. Try values of D until a good fit is achieved. We use 
2-dimensional vector addition to see how lumped-together the knots are.

Mathematically, let

C(D) = Sum[ cos(2 Pi t(i) / D), i = 1, ..., K ]

S(D) = Sum[ sin(2 Pi t(i) / D), i = 1, ..., K ]

Q(D) = Sqrt( C(D)^2 + S(D)^2 )

(C(D), S(D)) is the vector sum of the positions of the knots, and Q(D) 
is its squared length. If Q(D) is close to K^2 then we are in business.

Look for large spikes in Q(D) as a function of D. A bit of care has to 
be taken because Q(D) has more spikes (prominent local minima) at 
submultiples d/n of d (harmonics of the fundamental frequency). In fact 
the minimising value of D is m.d where m is the greatest common divisor 
of the n(i). and thus will locate a subharmonic if the interevent 
sequence doesn't adequate reflect the fundamental base period.

If there are more sequences of events with the same base period but 
possibly different phase offsets c, just add together the separate Q(D) 
values for each sequence and look for spikes of the combined Q value.

This algorithm is based on ideas for 'directional' or 'circular' 
statistics for which a good source is the book 'Directional statistics' 
by Kanti V. Mardia and Peter E. Jupp [New ed.] Chichester: Wiley, 2000. 
I've seen it used for various problems ranging from the 'megalithic 
yard' to the weights of loaded coal lorries. I've used it successfully 
myself to analyse, inter alia, tapping/drumming data.

If it's any use I can supply copies of some Matlab code written by my 
colleague Matthew Brett which implement this technique.
