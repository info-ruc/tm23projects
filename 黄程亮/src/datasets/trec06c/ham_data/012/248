Can you translate this into "EE for dummies?".
I slowly start to grasp some of the idea about 
voltage dividers but still don't understand. 
Won't this setup drain the battery? How does
one calculate and wire such a thing - in this
particular case?

I ask this because I want to use a lead battery
for my lego robot, not only do I have such a 
battery already :) but I understood that the 
characteristics of these things tend to be a 
more gentle curve towards the LOW battery 
situation and thus better measurable.

(Opposed to NICADs steep curve from 1.2 to
0 point something very quickly)

Help would be appreciated!

Sure:
Solder a wire to the "BATTERY +", add 2 resistors to make a voltage divider
(to divide the battery ABSOLUTE MAX condition, say about 12V, down to about
4 volts for the analog 0-5v range), and feed it into an ANALOG input point.
 Put a multimeter on the battery to measure its volts in a LOW charge
condition, and then in a HIGH charge condition.  Read the HB analog input
value for both those conditions, and assume a linear connection between bat
volts and analog reading.
Pity it wasn't built in!
