Hello,

We plan to design  a robot which has to move very quicly and very
accurately.
For this matter we wonder if it is necessary to use one handy board or
to link two handy boards to complete such a task.
(If we use 2 HB, one (the slave) would be in charge of computing our
position (encoders and infrared beacons), driving our motors,and
processing all the data comming from our sensors (mainly bump
sensors).The other would receive from the previous all the positions of
the objects on the field (our robot, opponent's robot, obstacles) and
according to our strategy choose the best way to reach the goal (it's a
soccer robot contest).)

Maybe, some of you have alredy carried out such projects and can share
with us their experience.

Any advices to help us evaluating our HB needs would be appreciated.
