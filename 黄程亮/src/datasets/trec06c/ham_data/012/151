Hi, everybody.
A little question that upset us :

We plan to use two handy-board : a master handy-board and a slave one.

The slave handy-board would make some difficult calculations for the master one and would send the results to this last one.
The master handy-board would send the data for the caculations to the slave one and would say to it to stop if needed.

Is it possible to do this (if possible, in a simple way) ?

Thanks a lot in advance.
RC99 & OM99

Hope the force will be with you !!!!!
