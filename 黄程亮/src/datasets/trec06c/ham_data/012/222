The components you're looking for sound exactly like ones that came with my
Lego Technic kit.  The actuator cylinders come in two sizes (the big one's
about the size you're looking for), and there's a compressor cylinder and
pressure reservoir available, too.  The only tricky part is that they don't
offer an electrically-operated air valve (that I know of).  You can purchase
most of the components individually, including air hoses, T fittings, and
valves.  You can get a catalog by calling Lego Shop-At-Home (1-800-453-4652).

I know I'm starting to sound like a frothing-at-the-mouth Lego fanatic, but
really they do make very high quality parts, precision-formed from virtually
indestructable nylon.  They can be sort of expensive, and try to avoid
buying Legos from Dacta/Pitsco if you can help it, because they often have
even higher prices than Lego Shop-At-Home.
