Hello everyone!  I was wondering why my IC compiler ( IC-2.853Rev2 )
keeps giving me wacky and excessivly silly errors.  Are there libraries
that I was supposed to download to get rid of those pesky start_button and
start_press undefined error statements.  If there is an ftp site for these
libraries, that would be great. I looked around the cher.media.mit.edu one
and didnt see there.  If anyone could help me out with this, that would be
great.  Apparently programs that run on other peoples handyboard dont want
to compile for mine and thats when i get the error message.

Thanks!

-Richard
