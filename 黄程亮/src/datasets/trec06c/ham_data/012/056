There are instructions on the Handy Board web site for how to sever the
motor power trace on the HB and plug in a separate battery pack for the
motors.  This allows you to use a motor battery of any voltage you like up
to about 36 V.

If you want to stick with the HB battery, try using the new Lego Technic
gear motor (#5225).  They're $17.50 ea. from Lego Shop-At-Home (800-453-4652).

Wendy Parson,             If you can find something everyone agrees on,
