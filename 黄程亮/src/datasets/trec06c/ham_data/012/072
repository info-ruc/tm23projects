If the VCR isn't totally dead, maybe you could plug in what's left of it and
probe the leads that used to go to the IR module for a live one?

The HB comes with a modulated IR beacon port (right next to the modulated IR
receiver).  I don't know how it works, but it looks like it's probably
similar to how the IR beacon on the 6270 board works.

If the VCR remote still works, though, why not use more of it than just the
IR LED?  Why not use the modulator that's built into it?  Then you'll know
it's at the correct frequency and sending the correct signal format.
