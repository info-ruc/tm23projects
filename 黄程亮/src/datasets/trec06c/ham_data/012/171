At the beginning of January, fifty 6.270 teams were given kits
containing a microcontroller board, sensors, Lego parts, and the rules
for this year's contest, "RoboGolf". With a basic knowledge of
robotics, taught by the contest's student organizers, the teams each
then set out to construct an autonomous robot. Three and a half weeks
later, those robots competed against each other at the twelfth annual
6.270 competition until a victor emerged.

This year, the contest organizers are making videotapes of the
competition available to the public with help from MIT Video
Productions and sponsorship from Oracle. The price of the videotapes
will be $20 per tape in the United States and $25 elsewhere. Note that
these prices represent the costs of production and shipping, and 6.270
does not intend to make a profit on the sales. All tapes are
high-quality VHS dubs and come in a stylish vinyl case.
