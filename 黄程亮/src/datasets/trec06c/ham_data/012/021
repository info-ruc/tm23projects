Subject: Cheap Lego gear motors

NEWS FLASH!

Any of you who, like myself, have been waiting for Dacta to deliver (some
time later this month) the Lego Technic 9V motor with gear reduction at
$24.50 each might want to consider cancelling your order, because Lego
Shop-At-Home (800-453-4652) has what they assure me is the exact same item
(#5225) for only $17.50 each, and shipping is at no extra charge.  Not only
are these cheaper, but they have a few in stock already.  If they're not
yanking my chain, then this is an incredibly good deal on gear motors that
plug right into the Handy Board.  Just thought you all might like to know.
