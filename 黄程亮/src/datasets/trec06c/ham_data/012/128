I use Linux to talk to my HandyBoard. I have written a couple of functions
(in plain C) to do so, and implemented a software handshake (even with low
speed PCs you have to do some sort of handshake). Of course, the merit is not
mine, I have mixed functions from people all over the net :-), but if someone
is interested I can send my code.

Humberto
