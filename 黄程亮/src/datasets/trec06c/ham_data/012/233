Subject: An answer from Polaroid

A while back I asked if anyone knew about a socket to accomodate the 9-pin
plugs that come with the Polaroid sonar modules.  I feel pretty dumb now,
because I talked with the people at Polaroid, who tell me that it's not
really a plug at all; it's supposed to be soldered directly to a PC board.
If I knew more about electronics, I might have guessed that.  <:|  Oh well.
Back to the drawing board.
