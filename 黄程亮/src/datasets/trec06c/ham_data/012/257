According to my measurements, the flat flex cable that comes with the
Polaroid kits is 1.25 mm (or 0.05"), so it would probably not be quite
compatible with the parts that Digikey offers.  I looked exhaustively
through the Digikey offerings, but only found 0.1" and 1 mm flat flex
components.  The only places I've seen the 1.25 mm series are on the Burndy
web site (www.burndy.com) and the Molex web site (www.molex.com), but these
two companies just make the parts--they don't sell 'em as far as I know.

Since finding out that the connectors aren't really plugs but board
connectors instead, I've decided to find someone to sell me a couple more
Burndy SLP9S-2's (or equivalent) and some flat flex jumpers without the
connectors on the ends.  That way, I can still have the modular connections
that I want without having to modify the components that are on loan to me.
I'll continue to document my progress, for the benefit of the few who follow
in my footsteps, and for the annoyance of those who couldn't care less ;)
