Today, the Empire cheers the destruction of Jedi Master Denowah, a rogue Star
Dragon that came out of hiding to assist the Rebellion.  Denowah brought to the
Rebels, a former Imperial Jedi Hunter, Marcus Albertus.  It is rumored that
they had a several day standoff in which Denowah finally stunned Albertus,
allowing him to be transported off the planet Dragonia, where they were both
representitives for a trade conference.

The Rebels learned that Inquisitor Tremayne had been dispatched to deal with
the Jedi, so they put him into hiding...or so they thought.  While his troops
persued the Jedi through the Outer Rim, Albertus was held captive aboard A.S.S.
Cyclops as a Rebel prisoner.  Later in the day, a team of unknown bounty
hunters managed to rescue Albertus from the Rebel craft.  This Rebel ship was
left in tatters as the bounty hunters used a remarkable amount of explosives to
free Albertus.  What Albertus' importance is is yet unclear.

Denowah jumped from system to system in his modified vessel, managing to avoid
the onslaught of Tremayne's assistant, Col. Sanders.  Finally, Sanders caught
up with Denowah, where the two ships pummelled each other, leaving Denowah to
fly to safety from his ship.  Sanders landed his craft and chased down Denowah
with his elite group of troops equiped with the best technology the Empire has
to offer.  Several troopers that stayed behind in the attack sent one last
message saying that they heard a loud explosion and the cave in to which
Denowah fled was destroyed, presumably killing Denowah and also, unfortunately,
Col. Sanders.  They then communicated nothing further.

Rebel sources tell us that this does not mean that Denowah is dead, and they
hope that he survived, but we at Imperial News know that Col. Sanders did his
job well, and that had his ship not been so damaged, he would be returning to
the Empire as a hero.  Good work Col. Sanders!
-----------------------------------------------

Game stuff (aka - What actually occured)

My much debated dragon went into hiding again basically...

After learning that Albertus would sell me out to the Empire, I gave him to the
Rebels, along with his ship.  Albertus is played by Chris.  The unknown (to
anyone but him) bounty hunter was played by Frank.  A crime lord played by Dan,
the GM and sometimes crime lord PC, paid Frank to save Chris so that Dan could
get al of the goodies on Chris' heavily modified ship.  Chris has a cloacking
devic e on it (don't ask how...long story) and so the Rebels want the ship, but
so does Dan's crime lord character.

Meanwhile, the Rebels gav e me to a guy named Lontek, who escorted me to
safety.  My dragon made it into space, on board a ship.  Col. Sanders chased me
down, but I kept leading him farther an d farther into the Outer Rim.  Finally,
I faced him, and we blew each up pretty well...being a Star Dragon, I was able
to leave the ship and fly to a nearby planet where I hid in some caves.

Sanders' and his troops donned negative force suits so I could not use the
Force on them.  A battle ensued, in which I used Beast Languages to have near
by animals help me defeat the troopers.  In the end, we posed to much strength
for the troopers to handle.  Sanders set off a detonator that leveled the cave,
which left him dead, and me alive...able to escape.

So, my dragon is alive still, feeling a little bad from the cave falling on
him.  There he will stay until around RotJ, when I will bring him out to aid
Luke agaisnt our giant evil Vader (whoi is stronger than the Emperor, although
none of us really know that).  No I am finally abandoning the Jedi deal, and
becoming a bounty hunter for the first time ever....  This is my first none
Force-Sensative character EVER.  Oh boy.

So, everyone thinks that I died, Albertus got rescued, and the Rebels are
trying to get out that cloaking devicce, but the crime lord wants to get it
back...should be an interesting set of missions coming up.

I'm gamemastering a post-Endor campaign, which is in many ways quite
politics-oriented. In my SW-universe, the galaxy isn't ruled by
the Empire or the Alliance, but there's lots of different unions,
alliances, empires, political fractions and independents.
The Alliance (or The New Republic) and the Empire are still the
most powerful to maintain the original SW aspect.

Anyway, there's need for political fractions etc...
I've already began designing the Tarash Empire and other
"nations", but there's still no political "parties" which
are necessary...
So here's a few "sketches" and I wish you could gimme some
comments, ideas etc.


        REPUBLICANS

Members of the NR that wish to re-establish the Old Republic.
In their opinion, the New Order emerged because of Palpatine,
not because a republic would inevitably result a totalitarian
movement.


        FEDERALISTS

Members of the NR who state that the Republic will eventually
lead to a new Empire. They wish to establish a federation which
is more like a commonwealth of independent worlds than a
nation of it's own.

  Fractions:
The Conspiracy: Only a wild rumour. There are accusations of
a federalist conspiracy inside the NR. The conspiracy is said
to use blackmail and bribery to get senators and representatives
to work for them. Federalists deny the existence of a conspiracy.


        EQUALISM

Well, calling it communism would be like calling a comlink a radio -
close to the truth, but too "earthly" to be Star Wars.
Equalists' objectives are:
- free education, health care and social security
- state-owned companies to run the most necessary services
  like transportation, hospitals etc
- ban megacorporations, multi-planetary companies, "stock gambling",
  incorporate new (less-risky) ways of financing
- "People first.", ensure that finance is given lower priority
  than the well-being of the common people
- direct democracy
Naturally, equalism is fiercely opposed by the business world
and the elite.

  Fractions:
REF: Revolutionary Equalist Front. An fraction which operates both
in NR and Imperial space. In NR space, they cooperate with the
government and act like a political party, but in Imperial space
they're armed rebels. The armed wing is banned by NR, but it's
widely suspected that the armed REF forces in Imperial worlds
are given arms, equipment and training. In NR, REF supports
federalists because they realize that an equalist Republic
isn't possible.
ARES: Armed Revolution for Equalist Society. A loose organization
for separate revolutionary movements on different independent
planets. Mostly fanatics and anarchists, the armed groups
consist of young radicals who are willing and able to use
any available means. ARES is declared a banned terrorist group
both in NR and the Empire.
PFPE: People's Front for Peace and Equality. A pacifist movement
with no official organization or leaders. It's a pressure group
dedicated to reveal injustice and to prevent war. They demand
a cease-fire between NR and the Empire, fight against racial and
social "apartheid". They publish announcements, reveal injustices,
organize boycots etc. A great deal of intellectuals of the galaxy
are members of PFPE, as well as a great number of Mon Cals and
Ithorians. They are not revolutionary, but share many common
goals with revolutionary equalists.


        EFFECTIVISM

Effectivists are devoted to eliminating the "equalist threat".
Their term for equalism is "conformism", which pretty well
describes their attitude - they think equalists want to
make people similar, not equal. They also (quite truthfully)
think that equalism would ruin the economy.
Effectivists think that a striving economy benefits everyone,
including the workers and the poor.

  Fractions:
PEL: People for Economic Liberty. A political party in the NR which
struggles to remove toll fees, lower taxes and to reduce the power
of worker unions.
GLP: Galactic Liberal Party. Although the Empire favors the economy
at the cost of the workers, they also tend to regulate the economy
and need high taxes and toll fees to fund the military and other
massive institutions. GLP wishes to increase freedom of commerce and
to reduce fees and bureacracy.
UFE: Union of Free Enterpreneurs. UFE is a pro-effectivism movement
of merchants, investors and artisans. It's enemies are assured that
it's in fact led by an inner circle of major corporate leaders,
and that various anti-equalist terrorist actions carried out by
mercenaries are funded by UFE.
FSU: Free Spacers United. An organization which wished to develop
free trade, remove tolls and reduce bureaucracy. They also demand
less armament restrictions for cargo ships and more actions
against pirates and hijackers.



        MORALISTS

Moralists are fanatics wishing to ban gambling, prostitution,
drugs, alcohol, sex-holovids etc etc ad nauseaum...
These are the angry grandmas who want to ban everything
they don't understand or enjoy. <grin>

  Fractions:
NMO: New Moral Order. A fanatic fraction which struggles to
rid the Galaxy of gambling and commercial sex forever.
They blow up porn shops and casinos, expose unmoral deeds
done by famous people etc...
There are hundreds of smaller organizations, ranging from
political pressure groups to violent terrorist groups.

planet Oblidi-oblida - Pedro Frederico was killed today by an unknown
individual.  Pedro was known to be a man capable of getting information about
anyone at any time.  He leaves behind a small syndicate lead now by his brother
Enrico, and his friend Jose.  Imperials forces arrived on the scene and cleaned
up the mess left ina drak area of town not often patrolled by Imperials.

Another death, perhaps related, was that of Imperial commander George.  George,
while know to be a drunk and not very good at his job, was always serving the
Empire to the best of his abilities.  George will be replaced by Lietenent
Kidd, a 19 year old fresh out of the command academy.  It is uknown how he
quickly advanced so soon, but everyone at HQ says taht he is a fine officer..
The death of George is odd in that it was an assassination by what appeards to
be an Imperial...when qeustioned, the suspect managed to escape.

In other news, Galaxy Burger tycoon, Devar Artone, came by the planet today with
his loyal henchman, Marcus Albertus.  Devar also baught out herman's Bar, a
popular local establishment, saying that he would push money into it so that it
would become an ever nicer place, and so that it could expand beyond the
planet.

For unknown reasons, the Emperor and the loyal Darth Vader paid a visit to the
planet today.  We were honored to have them here.

---------------------------

Game stuff:

Well, in my first missio ntaht I have GMd in a while, there were some
interesting things that happened.

1 - Marucs Albertus, Devar's henchman, came down to negotiate to find out where
the Rebels are hiding Albertus's ship, which has a cloaking ddevice on it (long
story how that happened...).  He was to find his contact, pay him and get the
location of the Rebel's that have his ship.  Well, he gave an u nsigned credit
voucher to the contact, only to have the contact assault him and leave.  He
awoke to find that he had been tricked, and that tons of cresits were stolen.
The real contact came to him finally, and this contact was the guy tyhat died -
Frederico.  Albertus did not like what Frederico was saying, so he mouthed off,
and Frederico tried to leave.  Albertus s hot him in the leg.  A battle ensued.
Frederico was killed.

2 - Irritated at multiple failures, Devar Artone (played by Col. Dan Lorentz)
the crimelord, came down to personally deal with things now.  He and Albertus
located the best friend of Frederico and got the info. they needed.

3 - Meanwhile, Devar realized that his contacts here were out of date and old,
so he had Albertus disguise himself as a Lt. and assassinate George.  He had a
young kid take his placce.  On the escape route, something happened...

4 - That something was an encounter with Frederico's borhter who now runs
Frederico's busness.  Devar tried toescape, and does, leaping from his vehicle
unscathed, taking Marucs and his other body guards with him.  Devar develops
hatredc toards Frederico's brother.  After rolling and running to safety, Devar
and Albertus find two doors at the end of an alley.

5 - Door 1 - the blue door.  This leads Devar to Herman's Bar, the only place
that Devar doesn't have control over on this planet.  Devar buys the owner out.
Albertus sees some good looking girls and has some fun with them.  Byt the time
he is done, Devar is gone.

6 - Devar went into the green door, which was the location of a secret
convention of crime lords that Devar just happened into. (I would have gotten
them there somehow, but this was easy).  There, he finds that some of these
crime lords are with Frederico andsome hate him.  He finds those that hate him
and strike deals with them.  So, Devar now controls an enormous (for him) fleet
of ships consisting of 6 corvettes a dreadnought and his luxury cruiser.  Let
me tell you that as GM, he will need more than that to fight the others off.
Devar had one of the Frederico supporters killed by Marcus Albertus, and his
new associate, my new PC since the demise of my space dragon.

7 - Devar was all happy and rode off into the sunset...hoping to defeat the
other fleet and also have time to get a leg up on that cloaking device...which
Frederico's men still know about, despite Frederico's death.

GM notes:

Basically, this sets up my PC, sets up a giant war that Dan will control as
crime lord and Chris (Albertus) and myself will be large parts of.  Other PCs
in our group will be able to choose their own paths.  The battle for the
cloaking device is now no loger Rebels versus Dan, but Rebels vs. Dano, vs.
Frederico's guys....all of them have to fight each other.  I figured that if
Dan was a crime lord PC and had two awesome fighters (me an Chris), why not
pput us all to use and start a war where everyone can choose sides, etc...  It
should be a lot of fun.

Also, the visit from the Emperor and Vader was just some fun I had with Chris'
PC (Albertus_).  In his assassination of George, he took the elevator up.  It
stopped on level 3, and the emperor got on with his red troopers and asked
Albertus to leave.  Albertus wisely agrees only to speand 10 minutes in the
level 3 hallway listneing to screams coming from down the hall of a guy
screaking, "I am a Jedi!  Let me go!  ARRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!"  and a lot of
pain, etc...  It was just a funny way of scaring Chris.  He, for once, could
not wait to get back to the elevator and the wonderful Yanni elevaotr music (or
Kenny G, pick your poinson) :-)

Sorry for all the typos...those of you that read my messages know of my telnet
program problems....sorry.  :-)

Galactic..Outer Rim..
--------------------------------------------------- Volume II Number 1
BARBARIAN HORDE BOARD THE T/T "VICTORIOUS" !
--------------------------------------------------------------------

A very amusing incident happened earlier this week, when I was happily
voyaging on Telgordo Travels' old luxury liner "Victorious", bound for
the Minas cluster. The food was great, my fellow passengers was amusing
(among others an obese male Rodian with a beautiful young human(!)
fiancee) and the price was just right for my finances... (Wonder why it
was that cheap?)

Anyway, I was happily chatting up the quite striking young lady in a
cozy recreation lounge when a heavy metallic thump echoes through the
ship, and a moment later all the lights go out. I couldn't pass up on
such a good opportunity, and me and the lady had a few hectic & ecstatic
minutes...

But it couldn't last. Gradually, an emergency light or two lit up, only
emphasizing how dark it really was. A heavy thumping echoed through the
corridors, getting nearer and nearer... And all of a sudden these
strange figures march into sight. At least a dozen bulky man-shapes in
black, worn spacesuits, with a heavy backpack and what looked like a
heavy missile launcher connected to the backpack by some thick cables.
The first who saw us opened fire and promptly, in a blinding ray of
light, set our couch afire. I didn't really care much for that sort of
situation, and swiftly disappeared down a corridor in glaring nudity...

Through a turn of events I don't care to detail, I happened to, ah,
borrow a set of that soldier's outfit and slip into an escape capsule,
getting away by the hair on my neck (again). And I tell you, those suits
are monstrously heavy, I lay wholly exhausted for the better part of a
day after wearing it for an hour or two.

But anyway, I saw those barbarians most foully strip the ship of all
carryable valuables and torch the rest with those flashlights of theirs.
Blasphemous.

So, gentlebeings, if you happen to find a quite worn set of expensive
clothing lying in the recreation lounge of the "Victorious" on your next
travel, or happen upon a nice female human asking for me, please get in
touch...

GM Scoop...
     About the Article:

Back in business at last! This article is designed so it can be thrown
in pretty much anywhere at any time in a campaign (perhaps as a
forewarning? <evil grin>)... Inspired by Armage's Beam Tube stats,
included below a bit expanded. Feel free to elaborate on the loose
threads as much as you like... <grin>


STATS:
Beam Tube (modified)
Model: Timms Emperor-4 Beam Tube
Type: Antiquated energy-particle weapon
Scale: Character
Skill: Firearms: beam tube
Ammo: 90 (backpack), unlimited (power generator)
Cost: 3,900 (antique store)
Fire Rate: 1/2
Availability: 3, R or X
Range: 3-10/20/50
Damage: 4D
Game Notes:  Must be fired two handed.  Move reduced by -2 because of
weight of weapon and backpack. (-1 if 5D STR, 0 if 6D)
Every time weapon fired, roll 2D:
        2-4 - Internal refinement tubes thrown out of order. Weapon
requires 1D hours to repair. (Easy firearms repair:beam tube (-3D
unspecialized))
        5-12 - Fire as normal.
