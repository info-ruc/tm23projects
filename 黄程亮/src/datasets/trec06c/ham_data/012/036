Hi.  I keep trying to download programs into my handyboard and from the
console it seems to work, but often it wont even download the code due to
"Power Glitch" error messages.  I think the Handyboard homepage had
something about that being the wrong STR file, but i looked in there with
resedit and it is pcoder22.s19 instead of the pocde_hb.s19 which, from
what i read, isnt supposed to be there and is supposed to be the cause of
the Power Glitch error message.  Im pretty sure I havent drained the
batteries or anything.
Any ideas what is going on?

Also..If you dont mind, i have some other questions.  First of all, I'm
working with the handyboard and Interactive C for the first time. Im
basically depending on sample programs and the Handyboard user manual.  I
have about 5 weeks to get a program that i have already written debugged,
working, and probably revised.  My program that Ive written basically 
uses 2 IR sensor inputs to direct a mobile rover away from obstacles.  It
decides it is too close when the analog input is less than 100 on either
side and tells the motor the appropriate thing to steer away from that.

Is this a good method?  Im running out of time and I think the handyboard
knows it.  It is sitting there mocking me as i speak.  Hehe.  Thanks!
