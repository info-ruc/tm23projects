Hello everyone.  I finally got everything cool with the Handyboard I'm
using in terms of the software and loading it and getting all connections
right.  The only problem now is that the motors on my little robot pretty
much stop after maybe 45 seconds of operation.  The motor lights do what
they are supposed to but they blink.  Im assuming this is a battery issue.
Is there any way to boost the power tot he motors so that they will run
for at least half an hour without killing the handyboard? Should I just go
looking for something with smaller motors?  The ones im using are just the
standard little ones.  If you guys know anything, I'de appreciate that.

Also..I watched Robots Rising on the discovery channel. Cool stuff...
Has any out there doing any thing with analog robotics using only
transistors and the like?

Thanks!
Richard
