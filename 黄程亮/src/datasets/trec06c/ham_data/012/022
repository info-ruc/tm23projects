Hello all:

I played with the V2X a year or so ago, and found that virtually anything
magnetic interferes with readings. I found that the wiring in my office
created false readings when the compass was moved around, especially if
close to the walls. Sometimes the heading would shift 180 degrees, when near
an operating wall outlet. I have two units, and each behaved the same.
Outside, there was no problem at all. They measured perfectly. These things
(at least mine) are very sensitive. I would imagine that permanent magnet
motors would also create a similar problem. I never mounted one in my bot,
as I thought there would be a major problem in navigation, due to the wall
wiring electromagnetism, as I like to run my bots indoors. 

Maybe yours are newer and improved versions, to where this is not so much a
problem. I would love to here if this is the case.

I would really appreciate any new information on ways to improve these
units. They definitely have major potential.

Kent
