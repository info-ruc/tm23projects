Hi everyone.. sorry to use the Handyboard mailing list for this, I'm 
trying to contact Marie Cahill who sent me some messages regarding 
robotics and stuff:

Marie, I tried to send you a message from work to the address 
<mchu4mc1@fs2.ee.umist.ac.uk> and it bounced each time. So I tried to 
look you up on the web but to no avail! Have I got the address wrong?
Please could you drop me a line at <daveh@liteon.co.uk> or here.
Thanks
-Dave

Sorry to all Handyboarders again!
And thanks for the response re. 68HC11s in the UK. Much appreciated.
