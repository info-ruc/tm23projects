Perhaps the problem is your motor-drivers IC's. If you use the L293D or
something, which are standard on the HandyBoard, you can only draw abou
600 mA. I use the other ones mentioned in the HB manual (they're from
Texas Intr., but I can't remember the number right now), which allow you
to draw up to 1A. If you drivers IC get hot, this could be the problem.
If you only use 2 motors, you could also try to use different driver IC
for both (e.g. use only 'motor 0/1' and 'motor 2/3').

I saw a program on robotics a while ago on Discovery, and there was a guy  
who builded a complete zoo of robots consisting of only a couple of
transistors. They did move indeed, but he said they were adapting to their  
environment, which I find hard to believe.
