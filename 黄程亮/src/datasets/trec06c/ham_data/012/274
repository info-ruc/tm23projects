Ah, that takes me back a bit. I built one in the late 60's
from plans in Practical Electronics, used about 40
transistors and mechano bits. Its collision avoidance sensor
was based around an OCP71 photo transistor mounted in an old
Pifco torch reflector. It wandered around on its little
motors and avoided bumping into things. Robotics has
certainly come a long way in the last 30 years hasn't it?
    Or if you want to go back even further check out Grey
Walter's Turtles, circa 1950, a couple of valves (tubes to you
transatlantic types) and they demonstrated primitive behaviours.
