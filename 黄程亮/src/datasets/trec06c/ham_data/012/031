We ordered a lot of our stuff from the states, delivery time wasnt bad
as long as they had it in stock...  you might try Electrosonic in
vancouver (www.e-sonic.com), but digikey and the like down in the States
are pretty good too. also, if you can find exactly what you want from
BG  Micro, they are fairly reliable and usually cheaper.

Good Luck!
