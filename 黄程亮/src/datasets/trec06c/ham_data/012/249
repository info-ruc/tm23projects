I think it was the crazy guys in Austin (the ones that put on
Robofest) that had a 'portable' air reservoir that consisted of a
2 liter coke bottle, a relief pressure valve and tubing. The coke
bottle was filled about a third of the way with water, and then
dry ice chips were dropped into the bottle and the bottle was
then capped. The valve ran at something like 150 - 175psi if I
recall. And as long as you had ice you had plenty of pressure. I
believe they had plans for a self reloading version. (spring
loaded dry ice pellets) but I don't know if it was ever built.
