I have build the board described in my book "Mobile Robots" which is a
great book. I just got the board going after realizing it isn't a good
idea to
assume the pin outs of all 32K x 8 ram chips is standardized  :)

I was hoping someone could help with my current problem, wiring this 20
x 2 LCD screen to the board. Its a standard HD44780 controller but no
matter what base software I
load using Interactive C, the display shows nothing. By nothing I mean
no data, the LCD does turn on and you see the little black squares.  I
have checked my wiring about 50 times and the LCD is fine because I can
use it with PIC's and my basic stamp 2 processor. I use the 74HC10 as
described in my book rather than the 74hc132 and after looking at the
handy board schematics I don't think the LCD would be affected by this.
I have also tried using the rug warrior code (pcoderwl.s19 and
pcode_rw.s19) and those don't work either. When I run IC I can type 1+2;

and the board will respond with 3 so I know the board is working and
everything seems to be fine except that I get nothing on the LCD. The
LCD that I am using is a 20 x 2 Hitachi display. I am using the
68hc11A0FN fitted into a botboard which is then wired to a breadboard
with the ram and LCD.

Thanks

John
