Subject: Metal detectors

Has anyone ever built a metal detecting device?  I found some plans at
http://ohmslaw.com/metal.htm but I don't know how sound it is, but I assume
it works.  I would like to interface the HB with a metal detector and have
my robot search around for metal object.  Any advice or known pitfalls with
trying to undertake such a feat?
