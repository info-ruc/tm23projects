Hello,

  I am having trouble with the serial_getchar function in serialio.  I 
would like to put a character into the received memory location directly 
without hanging the program.  From what I understand (0x102f) is the 
location, however I don't know how to put the character in there.

Can I poke a character in? If so, how?  I have tried and tried, but with 
no success.

Could someone explain how the serial_getchar works?

int serial_getchar()
{
  while (!(peek(0x102e) & 0x20));
  return (peek(0x102f));
}

Thanks,
Happy Handy Boarding!
