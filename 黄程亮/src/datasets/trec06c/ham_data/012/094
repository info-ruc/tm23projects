Hello:
I wrote a program to collect data off an analog port.  I set up an int =
array.  I find that=20
the array could be no more that 70 or so before I get a stack overflow.  =
Sometimes the program loads and I get a runtime error #4.  I tried =
getting rid of all possible files, yet I could  not increase the array =
size.  Is there something I am missing? or is it that this is the limit =
because of available memory?
Also, is it possible to send data up to the host PC at a rate faster =
than 9600 baud?
Can you tell me how?
Thanks,
Ameen Suleman
