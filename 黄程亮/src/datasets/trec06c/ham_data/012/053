Hi Dave,
	You can get them from RS, they deal with the general public via a
company called Electromail (tel 01536 204555). The price for the HC11A1
was 7.5 GBP plus VAT and delivery, this was in the October 97 catalogue
so they may have increased the price slightly by now. Delivery is a bit
expensive for ordering less than 30 GBP worth of order (delivery is 4.60
for less than 30 GBP order, 2.95 for 30 to 79.99, 1.75 for 80 GBP or
more).
The Farnell website lists the same chip as about 11 GBP so checking out
Electromail is worth it, especially if you have access to an RS
catalogue or CD (Electromail sell the CD for about 5 GBP).

Hope this helps.
