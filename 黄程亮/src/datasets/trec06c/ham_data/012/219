I can't believe nowbody of the list users know how works the sound routines
in the handyboard???
Please, if any have idea of how i can implement that on OTHER C COMPILER
(don't interactive C), please anwser to my question.

P.D,: Remember , the interactive C works into the handy, and the beep(),
tone(), etc, interact with other process (that is what i don't know), that
functions (beep, tone, etc) alone don't do nothing.
Please don't send me mail saying : use beep().
Thanks again.
