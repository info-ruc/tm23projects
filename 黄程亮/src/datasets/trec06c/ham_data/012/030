With sumo wrestling robots, I find that the high freqency noise from the 
robots and motors tends to confuse the recievers, expecially the metallic 
impact and collateral damage :)  

The ring is small enough that, though sonar is useful, greater success 
has come from feelers, optical, and infra-red sensors.

imho
