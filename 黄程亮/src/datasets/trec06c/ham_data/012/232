Hi German, I sent this to you before, but I guess you didn't keep
it.

This one is going to both the robot-board and handyboard lists
you can always find it again later by searching the archives for
these lists.

To beep the beeper using ImageCraft C you will need to set up
three
things, 
	-- Two global values, one containing the beep period, and
	   the other containing the beep duration. These should be
	   unsigned 16 bit values.
	-- an interrupt service routine for the OC5 timer, that checks
	   the duration value and if it is not zero loads the period
	   value into the OC5 counter and starts it, then decrements
	   the duration counter.
	-- A C function that takes a frequency and period and
           converts them into a pair of period and duration
values.
	   stores the global values and starts the OC5 counter for
	   the first time.

If you don't set up the OC5 interrupt routine in your crt11.s
file you should store in the new values in your main() function.
Remember that the interrupt vector table on the handboard is at
0xbfe0 (check that with the pink book, i'm using it from memory
and I do drop bits now and then).
