I have a sonar mounted on a panning servo, and I just bought an
el-cheapo Cirrus CS-50.  (It is functionally equivalent to a JR/Hitec
JR-507 or HS-300).  It works fine, although it is a noisy little bugger 
(but other servos don't seem much better).  It has enough torque to 
move a transducer around, and has a decent transit time 
(42.3 oz-in and 0.16s/60 deg at 4.8v).  I say go for it.

Cheers, Skye.
