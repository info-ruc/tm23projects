Hey! I ResEditted my pcode_hb.s19 file that i got from netscape into the
Init application.  It then started up and said Fatal Error <> undefined
hex character.  Could somebody, if they have the time, send me copy of
this?  Im stuck here on an aging macintosh and not enough hard drive space
for any web browser.  Thanks!

Solder Happy,
Richard
