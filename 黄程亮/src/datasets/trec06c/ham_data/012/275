=09Hello Fran=E7ois, HandyBoard group,

=09We had a similar problem when we tried using an R/C model
=09as a mobile base platform for our robot.
=09Searching the net turned up the LMD18200 (3A, 55V H-Bridge)
=09from National Semiconductors, which was suitable for our
=09needs
=09=09 (http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LMD18200.html).

=09It can be ordered from Wirz Electronics
=09=09(http://wirz.com/motor/board.html)

=09I believe that the 10A continuous mode you require would
=09increase the size of the component considerably. Do you
=09have size/weight restrictions?
