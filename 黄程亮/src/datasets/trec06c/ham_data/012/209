I was wondering if anyone has a good source for fairly high quality, low
cost gear motors that inteface well with the handy board. Right now i am
using a cheap little, current hungry 3v toy bulldozer as a platform. I
would love to find some nice little efficient brushless 9v gearhead
motors with encoders that i would not have to spend $200 apiece on!
