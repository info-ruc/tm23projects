After getting confused one too many times with the crackpot Robert 
Lavelle (I'm also a Robert Lavelle), I wrote to him to please specify 
who he is and give a legit e-mail address.  Well, now I'm on his spam 
mailing list--and he doesn't accept replies (they just come back).

So, in honor of the coward I've made a parody of his homepage.  It can
be found at:
http://www.fortunecity.com/roswell/argento/142/index.htm
Be sure to type in "index.htm" or the page won't come up.  You may want 
to list it with his section on your "Crackpot Page" (please, pretty 
please?)

Enjoy!

The other Robert Lavelle

p.s.  His actual site can be found at 
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7699--however, don't expect to
find a real e-mail address or anything else--just his vague ramblings.
