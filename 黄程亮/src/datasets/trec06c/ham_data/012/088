In the Polaroid manual, the connector is referred to as a "Burndy 9
pin connector SLP9S-2".  

I once spoke to someone at Polaroid who gave me the cross reference
"JST 1B0579A" (don't know if it's Burndy or not).

I am pretty sure the cable is standard 1 mm flex cable, 9 conductor.
Digikey has a bunch of these connectors but only even conductor
counts!  However, interpolating part numbers, the device should be
Hirose Electric Co, Ltd.'s FH21-9S-1DSA.

Will, please let us know what you come up with.

Fred
