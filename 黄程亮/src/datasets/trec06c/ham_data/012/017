I've had very good luck with the Cirrus CS-70 which is basically a
Futaba S148 replacement.  It costs less than $10 and is available
mailorder from Hobby Shack (800) 854-8471.  I've modified a bunch of
these to act as wheel drive motors for small robots and haven't had a
problem with any of them. 

They have an even cheaper one, the CS-50 which should work fine for a
low-mass sensor array panning application.
