It is clear to me that if i even attempted any work with construction and
installation of a H Bridge for my handyboard it would be left a blackened,
smoldering wreck.   So this is my question.....is there any where to get a
preassembled H-bridge from somewhere?  

I looked over the schematics and was pretty confused.
