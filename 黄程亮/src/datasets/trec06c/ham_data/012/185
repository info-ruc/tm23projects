Subject: Strange IC error (nevermind)

Never mind... I discovered that IC didn't like me using a variable for the
8 bits to pass to bit_set and bit_clear (too bad it didn't just tell me
that instead of throwing its arms up and quiting).   I wanted to use the
variable to save code space, but alas I changed the code to an if statement
and two while loops.
