Can anyone clarify something for me?

A section of the code of sonar.asm goes as follows:

variable_sonar_time
sonar_time              FDB       0

What does this mean? Why are there two variables before the FDB?

Another section goes as follows:

variable_sonar_enable   FCB       0
sonar_enable            FCB       0

I thought IC integers had to be 2 bytes.
And also, are these two different variables?

Thanks for any help.   :)
