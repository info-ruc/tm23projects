Perhaps your motors draw too much current. You can only draw 600mA from
the L293D driver IC. In the HB manual, you can see you can draw 1A from a
IC from TI. (I don't know the exact number right now).
You could try to use a seperate IC for each motor, if you only have two
motors running at once (eg. only use motor 0/1 and motor 2/3
simultaniously.) If your L293D's get really hot, this might be a solution.

I saw an other program Discovery some time ago, in which a guy had build a
zoo of robots, all build from old Walkmans and only containing a couple of
transistors. They did walk, and the guy who build them, said they adepted
to their environment, but I found that hard to believe.
