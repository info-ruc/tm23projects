Since I only have like a month and a half to get my little robot running
and Im kind of on shakey ground with the IR sensors, I wrote this failsafe
program. Like ive said before, Im not too familiar with Interactive C
and was wondering if you could take a quick glance over this code.
Im not sure if this is the most efficient way to program in this
navigational method or if i included multiple variables right of if i even
can.  Ill explail it first since simpletext does silly things with the
margins when i cut and paste...Its basically that you have 3 bump sensors
on the front of the rover, 7(left) 8(middle) and 9(right.)
Right and Left are like 5 inch long feelers.  Middle one is covering the
blind spot and is wider...its basically on constant table leg watch.
When it feels something it turns away or backs up.  

ALso....whats the deal with how long a motor will run for?  I know you can
designate what motor and how much power but can you tell the handyboard
exactly how long it will go?  

I utilized (or did my best too) the elif function. Yay!

Heres the code...

/* This is default touch navigation */
void main( )
{
     while(1) {
          if (digital(7) == 1) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 1)
          {
                 fd(1);
                 fd(3);
           } 
          elif (digital(7) == 0) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 1)
          { 
                 fd(1);
                  off(3);
                  sleep(1.2);
          }
          else
          {
                 printf("TOUCHIE FEELIE!/n");
          }
           if (digital(7) == 1) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 0)
           {  
                 fd(3);
                  off(1);
                  msleep(500);
           } 
           elif (digital(7) == 0) (digital(8) == 1) (digital(9) == 0)
           {
                  bk(1);
                  bk(3);
                  sleep(1.2);
            }
           else
            {
                  printf("Crystal Ship./n");
            }
      }
}
