Subject: Polaroid sonar connector

Does ANYONE out there know how I can get my hands on a couple of the sockets
that will accomodate the 9-pin Burndy connector plugs that come with the
Polaroid sonar modules?

I've searched the web, but haven't been able to find what I'm looking for.
I would like two of them, since I have two modules on loan to me (so I can't
modify them to use a different type of connector).

I realize that Dr. Fred Martin intends to include one of these connector
sockets in the design of the HB expansion board, and that this type of
connector socket is included on the Polaroid experimenter's board (which I
don't have), so they must be out there somewhere.  Polaroid hasn't been
returning my calls on this.  I would really appreciate any leads.  Even just
a manufacturer name and part number might help; a catalog name and item no.
would be even better!  Thanks.
