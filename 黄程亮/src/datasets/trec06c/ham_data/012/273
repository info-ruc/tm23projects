Hello,

I am also searching for a preassembled H-Bridge (12 Volt max 10 Amp in
continuous mode).
If anyone knows a good place to order one, I would be very interested.
(We already tried to build the H-Bridge from Chuck Mac Manis but its
components don't exist in France or are too expensive)

Thanks
Fran=E7ois
