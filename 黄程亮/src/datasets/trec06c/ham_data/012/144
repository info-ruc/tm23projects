Hi all,

sorry for raping the French language in my last message, the writing 
was correct (I hope so), but what you got was a bit chaotic...
 What can I do do to urge my "Pegasus-E-Mail" to translate all French 
accent marks in the correct way? Is there a possibility that you can 
get it in correct French writing or do I have to leave out any accent 
mark (which looks rather stupid)? 

Best regards to all of you

Wulf

Subject: CRUST-L: What is in the market, and where did they come from?

Hello all:

Last night I purchased some crayfish in a fish market near Baltimore.

They appeared to be Procambarus zonangulus, but may have been a
related species such as Procambarus acutus.  This surprises me
because I've only seen Procambarus clarkii here in the past.  Usually, P.
zonangulus is an incidental catch in wild harvest or pond culture,
although the literature suggests they may be very common in some
ponds.

The crayfish were exceptionally clean, lively, and (when I saw them)
packed in a box instead of the usual onion bags.   Their cleanliness
suggested to me that they were cultured or depurated rather than
packed immediately after a wild harvest.   The vendor thought they came
from Louisiana.  

Does anyone know of commercial operations raising Procambarus other
than P. clarkii that be the source of these crayfish?

Thanks,

Dave O'Neill

Wulf,

Get a Mac 8-) .

This is more a function of your computer's operating system and what
language packages it has than anything else. Except thatUNIX servers and
routers may not be able to handle the accent marks, if they don't consider
the accents as ascii characters. Even if your computer handles the accents
right, and the servers do also, if the recipients' computers don't have the
software, the language will be mangled.

One of the joys of letting US English dominate the web ... 8-p .

Don't bother weighing, just dump a capful or two into the water. If you

I wouldn't think so. Freezing a whole crab is going to generate lots of ice
crystals and lots of freezing damage. This will disrupt membranes, cells,
and so forth, destroying any compartmentalization of compounds or
biochemical classes.  Unless you're just after total protein, lipid, etc.,
and don't care where in the crab tissues each is.

>If you have any suggestion, please respond this mail as soon as possible.
>Thanks a lot.

Why not anesthetize, remove the needed tissue, then quickly kill the crab
in boiling water?
Or, you could try just removing a leg, and snipping off a gill, then with
sterile methods, cutting a small window in the carapace, removing a bit of
hepatopancreas, and crazy-gluing on a bit of plastic to cover the hole. All
under anesthesia, and you'll have a live crab afterwards for replicating
your experiments. Don't get supper this way, tho'.

I recommend that you simply place the crab in ice water for several
minutes.

Subject: CRUST-L: Re: your mail

Jennifer:

It's hard to know what to recommend, without knowing what sort of 
information you're looking for.

For theoretical treatments, you might try books by:
	George Gaylord Simpson
	Theodosius Dobzhansky
	Niles Eldriged (e.g., _Time Frames_)
	Stephen Jay Gould (writings in _Natural History_)
	Willi Hennig, _Phylogenetic Systematics_
	Edward O. Dodson, _Process and Product_

For general palaeontology books, perhaps one of the following would be 
helpful:

	Alfred S. Romer, _Vertebrate Paleontology_
	Edwin H. Colbert, _Evolution of the Vertebrates_
	Richard Cowen, _History of Life_ (a textbook)
	Niles Eldridge and Murray Alcosser, _Fossils_

For books specifically about human or primate evolution, you might like:

	John G. Fleage, _Primate Adaptation and Evolution_
	Glenn C. Conroy, _Primate Evolution_
	Donald Johanson and Maitland Edey, _Lucy_
	Donald Johanson and Blake Edgar, _From Lucy to Language_
	Ian Tattersall, _The Human Odyssey_
	Richard Leakey and Roger Lewin, _Origins Reconsidered_
	Roger Lewin, _Human Evolution:  An Illustrated Introduction_
	C. Loring Brace, _The Stages of Human Evolution_

Some of these are popular books, others are textbooks.  Of course, your 
library will have some of these and probably many others, including the 
major textbooks in the field.  Some of the most modern textbooks will not 
be in your library, because they are available only in paperback, and 
libraries are rightly concerned that these are too fragile to be 
effective for their purposes.  You may well be able to borrow a small 
textbook from someone in your anthropology or biology department (if 
you're at a college).

I should warn you that, if you're looking for a synopsis of human
evolution or the evolution of some other group, to be sent back to you via
e-mail, humbio-l is probably not the place to look.  Most of the traffic
on this list seems to come from graduate students and professionals in
physical anthropology, and a great deal of familiarity with the subject is
assumed by most of our subscribers.  Also, you may get more personal
opinion about some of the more contentious issues than you bargained for:)

Good luck!

Subject: CRUST-L: freshwater crustacean exhibit

Hi! My name is Jeff Campbell. I am very new to the crust-l. I am employed at
the Tennessee Aquarium in Chattanooga, TN as a senior aquarist. Our aquarium is
a world-class, primarily freshwater aquarium. Even though I am in charge of our
fish quarantine area, I have had for some time a keen interest in crustaceans,
especially decapods. As many may realize, Tennessee is a "hotbed" of crayfish
diversity. I have felt for some time that there is an excellent opportunity to
educate the public as to this rich diversity. Perhaps even an obligation to
tell this story... Well, my persistence seems to have paid off. There is a very
strong chance that our next theme for the "changing theme" gallery will be
crustaceans. Our first theme, "Jellyfish...Phantoms of the Deep" opens
tomorrow, and will run until spring of 2000. This gives plenty of time to
develop ideas, etc. Due to the marine nature of the Jellyfish... it was felt
that the crustacean gallery should have a primarily freshwater focus. Of course
there would be a number of marine animals as well...

I would love to hear from anyone willing to give me ideas on specific themes,
animals, etc. North america has rich diversity, and should probably not present
much of a problem as per acquisition of animals. Asian, African, Australian,
Latin American fauna might be more of a problem. There are a number of
freshwater crabs, shrimp, and crayfish from these areas that I would be
interested in, if I knew about them. The literature that is readily available
to me is on north american inverts.

This project has all the potential to be a very world-class, global
perspective, crustacean exhibit, and as I envision it, perhaps on a level never
attempted before...

Any assistance would be immensely appreciated...

This works presents a study of the taxonomy of the penaeidean shrimps of
the world. This group of shrimp includes many of commercially important
marine species of the tropics and subtropics, as well as many of the
species that constitutes a major link in the food chain of the oceans. The
works present keys for the identification of 7 families and 56 genera, as

Subject: CRUST-L: Bacescu 1967 - Hansenomysis

Hello CRUSTLers,

is there anybody out there who has ever heard of the following 
Journal, or the following title:

BACESCU, M. (1967): Contributions to the study of the genus
Hansenomysis and descriptions of six new species from Peru Trench
(Pacific Ocean). Duke Univ. (pp ?)

The journal could be "The Bulletin of the Duke University Marine
Station (Durham, North Carolina)". Here in Europe it is not possible 
to get this title. May be that somebody of you has a copy for me if 
it no that long.

Best wishes to all of you

Wulf

Faxon first described this as a subspecies of Procambarus clarkii
(then Cambarus clarkii) in 1914 (Memoirs of the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard College, 40(8):351-427.).  Hobbs later upgraded
it to species (Procambarus paeninsulanus) in 1942 "The Crayfishes of
Florida" University of Flordia Publication 3(2) pg. 104.

Subject: CRUST-L: Sesarmid larval culture

Fellow members
I am having some difficulty in rearing several species of sesarmid larvae 
and I hope you can provide some comments. The problem concerns the moult 
to the megalopa where almost all individuals are dying as a result of 
being trapped in the moult. Survival is good up until this moult but out 
of 200 larvae reared at various temperatures I have only had 2 
individuals succesfully pass into the megalops. I have had this problem 
with S. eulimene and S. meinerti, and a colleague had the same problem 
with S. catenata. Are sesarmids notoriously difficult to rear? I have 
noticed that the Z5 seems not to be feeding that well? Could energetics 
be a problems?
Any comments would be most appreciated?
Regards
Brent
PS: The larvae are being reared on Artemia larvae (unknown strain - S 
catenata were reared on SFB brand however)

Those I have reared are not, but there are tricks to rearing any decapod larva.

First, I would try switching artemia brands to a Chinese or Brazilian
strain.  In the past, Costlow and others reported problems with possible
pesticides in low amounts in the SFB brand, but it has been definitely
shown that the Chinese and Brazilian strains have higher amounts of PUFAs,
which may be lacking in the diet of the sesarmids you are trying to rear.
They cannot clear the exuvium because they lack the energy to complete
molting.  This metamorphosis is potentially the most stressful, as many
crabs that I have reared (not THAT many, mind you) fail at this stage.

Second, use only the freshest daily hatch for the same PUFA arguments
listed above.  As the nauplii get older, they are less rich in yolky
material and may provide a sub-optimal diet.

My fifth of a dime,

Joe

Subject: CRUST-L: setae details

Greetings,

In my work on porcelain crabs, I've come across a few species with setae
whose peculiarities are visible without an SEM. The setae have distinct
proximal and distal regions, and a distinct internal core and external
sheath; the internal core penetrates the external sheath distally; in one
species, the distal half is flattened, and there are paired fine "plumules"
radiating from the internal core. The setae are rather stout, and
transparent (else, of course, I wouldn't be able to see much of the
above!). A reviewer of my MS, in which I discuss these setae, asked if the
inner core isn't "just the lumen of the shaft within the seta," and if the
"plumules" aren't just "the dendritic canals that extend laterally from the
central setal dendrite?" I'm afraid my morphological expertise, such as it
is, does not cover the internal morphology of setae! I will say that I
don't see any of this internal structure in the thick bristles Does anyone
out there have any information about this, including references? By the
way, you can take a look at the setae at my web site (address below, click
on the "Odd setae" button).

Cheers, and thanks in advance!

Hello,

We would like to introduce you to our database and service if you have no=
t
already visited us on the Internet.  We are a searchable, worldwide
database of aquatic species and producers of food fish and aquarists
species which is accessible through the Internet, located at
http://www.aquafind.com/.  Listing aquatic producers in the database is
free and presents the opportunity of gaining more exposure to the
Aquaculture community.  Searching the database is also free enabling anyo=
ne
searching for a specific species or producer to have a better chance of
consummating their search successfully.  This database enables anyone
involved in the aquaculture industry to make contacts without having to
search the whole web hoping to find someone involved with the species the=
y
are concerned with.

We are constantly contacting producers and associated agencies to encoura=
ge
them to visit our site and register their company and it's products.
Individual producers, research facilities, corporations, and any other
persons or groups associated with aquatic species are all welcome to
register as the additional potential for exposure can only be an added
advantage for them.  Our site is supported by advertising and their are n=
o
fees involved nor is the data contained therein used for solicitation
purposes.  If the species is aquatic we will list it and if it is not yet
in our database we will add it.  If their is something you can not find, =
we
will help with your search.

After monitoring the requests in various aquatic news groups for
information, we recognize that this would be an ideal medium for
researchers to use as a network to make contacts.  This site is also an
ideal area for retailers to search to find suppliers for their needs.  Ma=
ny
buyers have already found the site to be useful in finding sources for
their companies needs.

Rather than continuing to relate the possibilities our site presents for
you, we just ask that you take a moment to consider it=92s value to you o=

your company and  register.  We welcome any questions or comments you may
have and look forward to your participation.

Silvia,
    I presume these are fairly small crustaceans. You will probably need
to aspirate the hemolymph sample directly from the cardiac region into a
glass micropipette pulled out to a fairly fine tip. The pipette should
contain water-equilibrated paraffin oil. Aspirate another drop of oil
after the sample to avoid water loss by eveporation through the pipette
tip.
    I presume you would then estimate osmolality from freezing point
depression of the sample in a cryochamber of some sort.
    I hope this suggestion helps. regards, John McNamara.

Subject: woodlice invasions

Dear colleagues,
During the last couple of years I have been repeatedly contacted by people
asking for information or help because their houses, buildings, appartments
were invaded by woodlice (in most cases Porcellio scaber). These invasions
were sometimes massive, with incredibly large numbers of woodlice being
found inside houses. In some instances this situtation even led to juridical
conflicts between owners and renters.

Is there literature available on this subject? Why do woodlice invade
houses? What can be done against these invasions? Etc.
Thanks.
Karel Wouters

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: methods for obteining hemolymph

The method for extracting depends somewhat on the organism. For most
shrimps, crayfish,lobsters, and crabs you can insert a small-gauge
hypodermic needle or capillary tube through an arthrodial membrane at the
base of a walking leg to obtain venous (prebranchial) hemolymph. For
shrimps and lobsters, you can also insert the needle or tube through the
arthrodial membrane at the junction between the cephalothorax and abdomen
(dorsal side) and obtain arterial (postbranchial) hemolymph from the
pericardial cavity.  Small (0.5-1 ml) glass syringes with snug-fitting
plungers work best (Hamilton syringes designed for loading gas
chromatographs, with short (2-3 cm) needles, work best of all).  Disposable
plastic syringes will also work, though I try to avoid them.  If the
hemolymph doesn't clot rapidly, it should flow into the capillary tube;
gentle suction is needed with the syringe. Transfer the hemolymph to a
small tube and chill on ice; if it clots in the syringe you may never get
it clean! It is standard procedure to let the hemolymph clot for a few
minutes, break the clot up with a glass rod or tissue homogenizer,
centrifuge to separate the serum from the clot, then analyze the serum.
Decapods have a hemolymph volume of about 30% of body weight, and can
generally tolerate a loss of up to about 5% of their hemolymph over a short
period; if there is not much 'bleeding' you may be able to sample
repeatedly from individual animals (e.g, before and after a salinity
change).

It was just the other day that I was told that toads are a very effective,
non-poisonous treatment against roaches. Let go a few toads in your kitchen,
and they will clean the house from roaches, and you never see the toads
because they hide behind the fridge and under the sink. Maybe they also like
woodlice?

Subject: CRUST-L: other question about woodlice invasion

Dears Crusters,

I observed in my house in Belgium woodlice invasions in spring and summer
1995 and 1996. There were woodlice everywhere! Under every flowerpot, in
every tree hole and in the cellar: thousands of woodlice. Concurrently, we
noticed that the woody window frames, which had been placed ten years
before, were degradated in some places. We thought that it was caused by
fungi but the holes were full of woodlice.

So, my question is : does anyone know cases of woody structure damages in
buildings caused by woodlice? Which are the feeding habits of these
animals? Are they xylophageous and thus directly responsible for wood
destruction? Or find we them there because there is moisture?

Thank you very much in advance,
Henry-Michel Cauchie

Silvia,
    I may have misunderstood  your original post, but I think you
mentioned sample volumes of between 0.5 and 2.5 microliters. It would be
very difficult to obtain this volume using a hypodermic needle and
syringe where the void volume (volume which cannot be expelled by the
plunger) is about 1.5 microlitres for a 3 cm x 0.3 mm internal diamter
needle.
    Of course, if you meant a sample volume of 0.5-2.5 milliliters then
following Chuck's suggestions would be the best way.

Subject: CRUST-L: setae details

Alan,

Have you checked "The Microscopic Anatomy of Invertebrates", the Decapod
volume mumbletymumble (sorry, all my refs are buried in boxes), and the
Insect volume 11 (3 parts).

>From your description and the image on your web page, I suspect the
reviewer is right, the core is the setal lumen. Not to say you're not
right, the setal lumen could be modified into an inner core, etc.
But:
- -I wouldn't use the term "plumules" in your description of the structures.
This is already used to describe fine more-or-less planar exterior
branching structures on setae.
- -What does the reviewer mean by '"the dendritic canals that extend
laterally from the
central setal dendrite?"'? This to me refers to neural dendrites, most
likely sensory. I do not think such neural structures could be seen in the
light microscopic image on your web page, but the inner structures are
obviously visible. Is "dendritic" being used in the sense of "tree-like"?
If so, it should be avoided, because of the confusion will neural
structures. And I would predict that these are sensory setae, and have
sensory dendrites within them.

I can't provide any references off hand (but then I don't have to, thanks
to Pierre!), but chaetotaxy is well-developed in mites and insects, so you
might find some information there. If you don't mind trying to convince
people that it's relevant to porcelin crabs.

The only way to really resolve this issue is to section the setae and
examine their structure. This will not be easy, if they are robust, but it
is possible (use a hard resin and a diamond knife). The "quick-and-dirty"
try is to prepare the appendage for SEM. When it's dry, use a razor blade
to fracture the setae, some proximally, some distally, then mount and coat
for SEM. If properly fixed (fix as if you were doing TEM), any sensory
dendrites, etc. ought to be visible. (The fracturing might work better
after the final 100% EtOH if done in LN2.)

Subject: CRUST-L: hemolymph sampling methods

Silvia,
After reading John's message I realize that I misread the volumes you want
to collect.  I agree with John that a fine capillary tube with paraffin oil
is the way to collect microliter volumes of hemolymph; my method works for
reasonably well (depending on your syringe) for volumes down to a few
hundred microliters.  If you plan to have students collect 0.5-2.5
microliters and analyze it by freezing point osmometry, I wish you luck; in
my experience, handling and accurately analyzing such small volumes is not
easy.

Subject: CRUST-L: RE: woodlice invasions

Dear Henry-Michel, Karel and others,

a house full of woodlice is not a nice event in the eyes of most of 
the people, but I think it is a typical phenomenon in Central 
European summers. They are really no danger to food (if it is 
well-stored) or wood. The other way round, they are even helpers to 
keep your living conditions sane. These fine small critters forage on 
the bacteria and fungi living in decaying matter. So they will 
diminish the fungi pollution of cellars and window frames. As our 
European species are not too well adapted to dryness, you can find 
them in moist conditions and in warm summers they would try to hide 
in every shade they can find for not to dry out (and as there are 
fungi in the holes of your window frames you can be sure it is a 
moist place!). The only way to get rid of them without exchanging the 
invaders as promised by Peter or danger for your health is to 
minimize room moisture and possible hides, then they will leave your 
house (or do not so and simply die). But at least when the winter 
comes most of them will die naturally and you can take a broom and 
they are gone.
Let's look forward to the summer coming soon. 

Greetings, Andreas

I know that Mesopodopsis bahia has been routinely cultured at the Lab of 
Aquaculture and Artemia Reference Center for various nutrition experiments. I 
think that they have discontinued that culture by now but they mat give you 
some info, perhaps. There has also been some litterature about that but I do 
not have the references under the hand.

The director of the lab is Prof Patrick Sorgeloos 
(patrick.sorgeloos@rug.ac.be)

BTW, Artemia has also been referenced as a potential candidate for biotoxicity 
tests and is much easier to culture in hte Lab than mysid shrimps.

Michelle,
    I suggest you contact Dr Marion Nipper of NIWA, in Hamilton, New
Zealand. She has developed several mysid toxicity assays. I am sure they
are in the pertinent literature; try a name search.
    I am sorry but I don't have her e-mail right now although I will try
and find it for you.

Hi

I need help for some questions.

1. There is hermaphrodites (genus Lysmata...) in sea water shrimps. Any
such species in fresh waters?

2. What would you say about this (Asian?) FW shrimp imported from
Singaporean Aquarium exporter:
http://personal.eunet.fi/pp/trc/mkatka.jpg? Even subfamily
identification or guesses of the genus, please. The shrimp is female.

3. Is there somebody who has seen Caridina japonica specimens available
from Singaporean aquarium exporters? These shrimps are transparent
(Caridinas anyway) with red points everywhere and greenish stripe on the
dorsal. In German aquarium fish magazine somebody wrote that they could
not be C. japonica because it is forbidden to export them from Japan!
Whats the true on this topic.

4. In FW shrimp species, does the fertilisation allways occur with
moulting? Can some shrimps species/genus store any spermatozoa for later
use?

Thank you again for your time

Wow! A question finally up my alley! 

There are many examples of protandrous hermaphrodites in shrimp, but they
appear to be limited to certain families (Hippolytidae, Crangonidae,
Pandalidae, some Alpheidae, and Atyidae are the major ones off the top
of my head). It's interesting that non-shrimp families don't appear to
show any hermaphroditism at all, with exception of some examples of
parasitism. Protandry is most always the pattern described.

Lysmata amboinensis is a protandrous, then simultaneous hermaphrodite (my
work) and it is likely that several other Lysmata species fit this
description in the genus. Unfortunately, clear experimental work is
lacking in other simultaneous suspects. (BTW, if anyone wants to fund a
postdoc looking further into to this, let me know!!)

The freshwater shrimp you are thinking of are probably Atyids. Several
species are thought to be protandrous, but not much work has been done in
this area. [Carpenter (1978) did an excellent paper on one atyid with a
review of hermaphroditism in higher crustacea.]

This is probably not easy to determine. The best expert of atyid species I
know is Shokita in Okinawa Japan. He is difficult to get in touch with,
however.

This is interesting, as there are very few laws on import/export
of animals from Japan in my experience. The exception are corals and some
CITES species. I can check with some sources there about C. japonica.

In most small caridean shrimp, they must molt to bear eggs. There has been
speculation that some Lysmata species store exogenous sperm (from
partners), but I have serious doubts on the validity of those statements
from my work. It certainly doesn't occur in L. amboinensis, and I suspect
other supposed examples of sperm storage are just misinterpretations. 

For example, solitary L. amboinenis will spawn eggs with every molt, but
none of those eggs are fertile. If you remove their partners, they don't
spawn fertile eggs afterwards. 

I'd be very interested if anyone has actually seen something else. If your
atyids are simultaneous hermaphrodites or are storing sperm, I'd be very
interested in hearing more, and would be interested in collaboration. 

Good luck,

Curt

Dear Jari,
Curt has already answered most of your questions. Protandrous
hermaphroditism is common in shrimps. The only shrimps known to be
SIMULTANEOUS hermaphrodites are three species of Lysmata. Curt has nice
experimental evidence for L. amboinensis (I wish he would publish it), I
have some evidence from the field for L. grabhami (described in J. Zool.
242, 799-811; 1997) and there is a third species being worked on by Dr. Bauer.

	The colleagues Sandqvist, Wirtz and Fiedler, started a very interesting
discussion about hermaphroditism in shrimps. I think I
can contribute with some very new information about protandrious
hermaphroditism in Parastacidae. In the neotropical species of
crayfishes of the genus Parastacus we have the coexistence of male and
female genital apertures in the same animal, suggesting the existence of
some type of hermaphroditism. Parastacus brasiliensis and P.defossus
from the southernmost State of Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul, were
collected, cultivated in laboratory and dissected. The results showed
that both species are sequential hermaphroditic species, of the
protandrous type, since ovaries are present only in larger (older)
specimen. Both testes in males and ovaries in females are connected to
the respective genital apertures. Very recently the graduate student
Alexandre Oliveira de Almeida in my research group, identified testes
progressively transforming into ovaries in middle sized P.brasiliensis
and P.defossus. The complete and final results of these investigations
will be presented during the Fourth International Crustacean Congress in
July 20-24,1998, in Amsterdam.

Subject: CRUST-L: Albuneid nomenclature

Dear Crustophiles,

	I have a question to ask of the group regarding the authorship
of an anomuran crab. The crab in question is the mole crab (or sand
crab) Albunea symnista. It is an anomuran in the superfamily Hippoidea.

	I looked up a few refs. and consistently got the following
authorship and species spelling- 	Albunea symnista (Linnaeus.
1766).
	But when reading a list of synonomies I saw Cancer symnista
Linnaeus, 1766 and later in the same list, Cancer symmysta Linne, 1758.
Surely, the latter precedes the first?? I have also seen Albunea
symnysta (Linne, 1758)?

	Can anyone enlighten me on the correct species spelling, and the
correct authorship and date, and why "symmysta" Linne, 1758 doesn't take
precedence over "symnista" Linnaeus, 1766?

	Regards and thanks,

Hi All,

In partial response to Chris Tudge's question, I would like to pose one of
my own. I was recently told that Linne (with e acute) was the real
spelling for Linnaeus. His students latinised his name in recognition of
his authority, but as this is neither necessary nor consistent with other
authors' names today, then Linne should be used in preference. Is this
right? I must admit to never really having questioned it too closely
before. Is there a consensus?

Regards
Peter

Subject: CRUST-L: BLACK GILLS IN PRAWNS

Has anyone experienced cooked prawns (monodon) showing blackness in the
gills and sometimes on pleopods about 24/48 hours after cooking.  This is
NOT blackhead which is due to undercooking, and may affect 20% of a batch of
prawns(usually under 10% in an affected pond). Less than 5% of ponds
harvested are affected and within affected ponds it is not the largest or
the smallest that show these symptoms. The gill tissue goes grey then black;
initially the underlying tissues are not affected but after 48 hours the
black colour spreads to other tissue.  If pleopods are affected they go grey
then black, then then area between them discolours and later the colour
moves into the tail meat. There are no visible symptoms before cooking.
We suspect algae, possibly oscillatoria, or something which is damaging the
gill tissues, maybe releasing an enzyme that causes tissue damage BEFORE
cooking. We suspect the causative factor follows a drop in salinity from
30+ppt to nearer 20ppt and may be related to algal succession.

Hello all Crustlers,
Being Swedish, I fully agree on Peter's comment of the "true" 
spelling of Linn=E9. That spelling comes from 1757 when he was made a 
nobleman and taking the name of " von Linn=E9"
(http://www.systbot.uu.se/dept/history/linneaus.html). However, since 
the use of the latin form of his name as auktor goes back to the 
beginning or middle of 1760, it is perhaps easier to keep it as it 
is. 
Best regards,
matz

   I've noticed the same variant spellings when I was doing 
searches on sand crabs. Unfortunately, there is no recent review on 
the genus Albunea, so I can't say which is the correct species 
citation. Christopher B. Boyko <cboyko@amnh.org> is working on a 
review of sand crabs and he might have an answer to this question. 
But he's a list member and has probably already posted on this topic 
by now. :)

Dear Chris (and other interested parties),

        I am currently working on a complete revision and phylogenetic
analysis of the Albuneidae, so I am familiar with the question posed about
the authorship of A. symmysta.  I have no idea why A. symnista (sic) (L.,
1767) has become so entrenched in the literature, but A. symmysta (L.,
1758) does have precedence and is the correct original spelling and date of
authorship.  Linnaeus (1764) also listed the species as "symmysta," so I
must presume that a typo crept into the 1767 work (I think the date of the
"1766" is actualy 1767).
        One thing to keep in mind about this species is that what has
traditionally been called "A. symmysta" in publications and on museum
specimen labels is actually a group of at least 8 taxa (perhaps more).  I
would recommend that the assigning of specific names to specimens be put
off until my revision is completed, in order to avoid adding more confusion
to this group.  Because the species are closely related, it is generally
not possible to tell what a particular author had in front of him/her
unless the specimens are availible for re-examination.  Of course, I would
be happy to examine albuneid specimens and provide identification for
interested parties.
        Here are the references regarding the above:

        Linnaeus, C. 1758. Systema Naturae..... 10th ed.
        Linnaeus, C. 1764. Museum S.R.M. Ludovicae Ulricae Reginae...
        Linnaeus, C. 1767. Systema Naturae..... 12th ed.

Chris

P.S. I prefer "sand crabs" to "mole crabs" for this family.  I think of
"mole crabs" as being Hippidae.

Thank you, Ayax for your help with those references

Well, thats a great start. Thanks for your help in the matter. In relation
to my observations so far, the size-frequency data is just a part of a
larger project I'm running on the river and I'm only part time on the
Finniss River work so I don't know when I'll be able to concentrate on it.
I'll send you something when I've had some spare time to collate the data I
already have.

To Crusties in general

Thanks to all who sent messages to Ayax.

In my decapod studies in the Finniss River (NT Australia) I have had mixed
results so far in relation to size frequency distributions. Some results
suggest that I am getting some shift in population size through time but it
appears to be confused by the breeding/ moulting being more opportunistic
than seasonal. On one hand, this latter factor is not unusual given that I
am looking at a tropical species but, on the other hand, it is unusal
because the river is in a monsoonal climate so there is a very significant
seasonality and highly variable water quality.
It may be that the time frame over which I am observing that is also causing
problems. The latest information was collected at approx. one month
intervals over 3.5 months from a few sites and this data suggests some
modality and shifting. The larger data sets are collected from more sites
but at approx annual intervals (This river is remote from my labs). The
larger data sets show no consistency in modality between sites that were
sampled at approximately the same time.
I would appreciate any comments on aging or moult frequency that you may
care to suggest.

Cheers

Hello CRUSTLers,

May be that some speleologists among you can help me with the 
following peculiar problem:

I have some cave crustaceans here from the following 
locations:
1) Shimoni Caves
2.a) Morgan's Cave  & b) Cueva Elefanta Blanco, Isla San Andres
This is all information I have about the locations. 
In my International Atlas (Rand McNally) I could not find THIS 
"Isla San Andres": where is this Island ? Morgan's Cave and the Cueva 
Elefanta Blanco are on this Island (?) [by the way, is this right, 
the name is: the "cave of the white elephant"??? ]
What is the location of the "Shimoni Caves" ?
I just want to complete a table with "material" with more details, 
i.e. names of the countries. So I would be very grateful if you could 
give me some hints.

Best regards

Wulf

If your spelling is right, which I doubt... is "the cave of the

Wulf,

Oxford Atlas of the World, 2nd Edition, pg 148 coordinate D-3:
I. de San Andres (Colombia)

In the Caribbean, off the Nicaraguan coast.

I can actually get to this book, wow. The question is, how many I. de San
Andres are there in the world? Does this location make any sense?

No Shimoni Caves listed, but there is a town of Shimoni shown in Kenya-on
the coast, just north of the border with Tanzania. Again, no clue if this
has any relation to your Shimoni.

Hello,

I obtained your email address from a biosci listserv master list on the WWW.
Please forgive any unwelcome intrusion.

My name is Valerie Lipow.  I am a freelance writer and career counselor in
Colorado (USA).  I am researching the interest in the community of science
educators for ancillary materials for introductory high school and college
level textbooks in the biological sciences.  I have been asked to do this for
a textbook publisher in the US.

In particular, I am interested in answers to questions below.  I wonder if you
would be willing to post these questions (either abstracted, or by forwarding
this message to your biosci discussion lists) to your colleagues.

What type of ancillaries (i.e., what content) would biosci educators like to
see available with the texts they use in their classes? For example, an
ancillary product describing career opportunities for students of biological
sciences is one topic; are there others?

What course(s) would the ancillary be used to support?

If you would like to see articles I have written on the topic of career
information for students of biological sciences, please feel free to visit
these web sites:

If you feel it is appropriate to pass this request on to your colleagues,
please encourage them to contact me off-list.  I'm happy to discuss this work
with anyone who is interested in additional information.

Thanks for reading this unsolicited message.  If there are other associations
or organizations I could approach to explore this idea, please let me know!

Dear CRUSTLers,

thanks to all of you who gave helpful hints, finding the Shimoni Caves
and Isla San Andres (with Morgans Cave and the Cueva Elefanto Blanco).
Now I know the locations and - thanks to the internet - I can also see
some pictures. Consequently, next time I actually have to 
refuse the sending of material and insist of visiting these islands 
myself. You will agree if you have a look at some links: 

1) Shimoni Caves: Nzombo Hills, Chala Paradise Island, Kenya

http://www.safariweb.com/technical.study.tours/advent.htm#shimoni

2.a) Morgan's Cave; Isla San Andres, Caribbean Sea, Colombia, 
(it belongs to Colombia, although it is aprox. 81,5 =B0 W and 12,5 =B0 N 
about 150 Km east of the coast of Nicaragua)

Hi there co-listers,

Im hoping to do some surveying for freshwater crayfish in some streams
near Barcelona in Spain. The chances are that, if present, the
populations are likely to be at rather low densities. Can anyone please
advise me on the best way of surveying (on a presence/absence basis) in
such situations in order to assess their distribution. So far the most
likely option seems to be simply looking under stones etc. but I'm not
familiar with working with this group of animals. The following
information might help in the election of a method:

1) The aim is to locate the native species Austrapotamobius pallipes but
it's possible that other non-native species such as Procambarus clarkii
may also be present.

2) The area is quite mountainous(under 1000m and generally calcareous
conglomerate) characterized by small streams prone to summer droughts
which often leaves the streams as a broken series of isolated pools up
to 1m deep.

3) The water level is generally low but can increase dramatically during
heavy rains which can ocasionally produce catastrophic floods, the last
such episode was in the autumn of 1994.

Any advice, or lit. refs. on the matter will be most welcome.

Thanks in advance,

Sen Cahill,
cquero@redestb.es

   There was a discussion of this recently on sci.bio.systematics. 
I believe it was something like this: Yes, Linne was his real name, 
but even he Latinised it to Linnaeus. His own publications all say, 
"Linnaeus," I think. As he clearly *chose* to publish under a 
Latinised name for scholarly work (*), and given the retreival problems 
when you list a reference using a "corrected" name that doesn't 
appear in the original publications, I think we'd best stick to
using Linnaeus. 

   I'm not even going to touch a concurrent debate that went on in 
the newsgroup at the time: whether or not there should be a ligature 
joining the "ae" in his name.


(*) I know I get mighty peeved when people "fix" my name by using my 
first given name, rather than my preferred middle given name (Zen).

Subject: CRUST-L: algal species for culturing freshwater copepods


I have a question regarding culturing freshwater copepods.  I have a 
population of Eurytemora affinis, which is primarily a brackish to 
hypersaline species, but has invaded fresh water.

I am growing the freshwater populations and would like to feed them 
freshwater algae to avoid introducing salts to the culture.  I have been 
feeding them Chlamydomonas reinhardii but their growth rates seem slower 
than when I feed them marine Rhodomonas sp.

I would like suggestions on what freshwater algal species have been 
successfully used for culturing copepods.

I would like to avoid diatoms, and would like something that the nauplii 
(100 microns) can also feed on.

Thank you!

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: Hermaphrodite discussion (FW shrimps)


Unfortunately, *most* examples of hermaphroditism in crayfish literature
are rare and anomolous instances. The word "aberrant" was used in many of
those paper titles.

I'd like to look more at Parastracid (sp?) papers to see if the trend is
the same.

Physiologically, it is reasonable to see a change in crustacean sex from
male to female. Charniaux-Cotton (CC) established that removal of
androgenic glands (AG) from males usually results in feminization to some
extent.

This suggests that damage to the androgenic gland (be it from physical or
parasite damage, or a developmental error) could result in feminization to
some degree. 

I'm not sure that this exends to having 2 sets of gonoducts for normally
gonochoristic animals. CC also concluded that the absence of the AG during
development resulted in near complete feminization. So without the AG, the
default developmental path is female.

In protandrous species (Lysmata seticaudata) CC concluded that the AG
doesn't develop until some germ tissue is feminized. The AG later appears
and arrests oogenesis (in previt, I think), masculinizing the rest of the
gonad. When these animals change sex, the AG deteriorates and supposedly
disappears. Inhibition of vitellogenesis ends, and male function
disappears.

Since much of CC's work was on one shrimp and a gammarid, it would be
interesting to verify these phenomena in other hermaphrodites. [For
Lysmata amboinensis (first protandrous, then simultaneous) I don't find an
AG in female-phase animals. So it is unclear how they maintain male
function.]

So hermaphrodite crayfish specimens having functional female (but not
male) reproduction follows what CC expected, if you think aobut it.

Just my humble ramblings,

- -Curt

<fontfamily><param>Times</param><bigger><bigger>Hello Crust-L people,

I am a researcher for a documentary series on invertebrates called the
Shape of Life.  Some of you may remember Pat Iampietro who also works
with us but is no longer on Arthropod duty. Pat has given me the great
story leads he received on this list.  I wanted to post this update on
the progress of the project and see if there is any new news people
wanted to share.


Here is a quick review of the Shape of Life Project.  Sea Studios
Foundation is working in cooperation with National Geographic
television to create an eight hour series for public television called
The Shape of Life.  The series features each major animal phylum in a
hour long exploration of the group.  The themes of the program are form
and function, evolution, biomechanics, and body plans. The series will
use lots of high quality footage, on camera scientists and animation to
teach biology in an engaging way.  At this point we are still writing
and will be going into production in late summer.  Research will
continue throughout production.


I would appreciate any input regarding recent or ongoing research,
interesting critters w/ neat & important adaptations, story ideas,
individual researchers/contacts, etc.  If you, or someone you know, has
an interesting crustacean story to tell let us know!


Please drop by our website if you'd like to find out more about Sea
Studios and the Shape of Life:

Hi Crust-Lers,

I'm working on physiological changes in crabs due to various stresses
(Temp./ Salinity) induced in the lab. I am wanting to do a preliminary
survey of tissues (gill, GI, renal) before and after stresses by light
microscopy and would like references and requirements for fixing tissue in
preparation for light microscope work.

1) What is the procedure for fixing such tissue?

2) Is there a primary fixative that specimens can be stored in indefinately?

3) What stain is recommended for such work?

Thanks in advance for all the help I know I will receive.

Sincerely,
Steve

Subject: CRUST-L: Re: Hermaphroditism in parastacid crayfish

Hello all,

I spent a bit of time trying to induce sex reversal of normal _Cherax
destructor_ by removal of the androgenic gland from males.  Actually what I
did was a vasectomy with concurrent remvoval of the fifth coxa and leg,
including the male gonopores, on the assumption that the AG was closely
associated with the vas deferens or the musclature in the coxae.  The
results indicated that no gonad inversion occurred and no regeneration of
the genital papillae occurred, leading me to believe that the operation did
include a successful andrectomy.

I do have some remaining questions though about the role of the AG.  It
seems to be necessary to maintain the presence of the genital papillae but
is not necessary to induce their formation in the first place.  Thus the
maleness of the animal is not dependent on the AG (the animals are sexually
differentiated before the AG has developed) but the maintenance of the form
of the exoskeleton is.  The vas deferens did regenerate normally; only the
external form was altered so that the operated males became "neutered".

Tom.

Interesting experiment!

>From the anatomical illustrations I have, I'm not convinced that you got
entire AG in your surgery. The AG is internal, just before the terminal
ampullae. From your description, I wouldn't be confident you got it. 

In an organism as large as a crayfish, it (the AG) should be easy to
observe in plain dissections. Is (was) it possible to dissect male
gonoducts and look for the AG first? You could even embed the terminal
portion and look histologically. It just seems that you should be able to
see the structure in large crusties. However, I don't work with crayfish,
so...

BTW, what is the "genital papillae"? I've seen this term used frequently
in fish, but have yet to see it used for crustaceans. Do you mean the
terminal ampullae of the sperm duct?

Don't confuse development and maintenance. :-)

I believe that most crustaceans have a puberty molt where external sex
charact appear. This is apparently AFTER the differentiation of the gonad.
If there is no AG during *development*, Charniaux Cotton claimed that
there would be *no* masculinization of the gonad. Some factor that the AG
produces is responsible for this. The AG may not be responsible for the
maintenance of all portions of the gonad, but it is apparently necessary
for development of maleness.

The explanation for protandrous species is that the AG is not
active/formed until some of the germ cells of the gonad begin to
differentiate towards a female pathway. Those female cells are arrested in
development and won't do much more until the AG shuts down. 

Masculinization appears to be a complex process and may vary with the
species. Certainly, more that the AG could be involved. It's possible that
your species is more fixed in the male pathway. Perhaps the AG develops
much faster in gonochoristic species, narrowing that window in time for
feminization of any part of the gonad.

I may have mislead you (or others) in my general description. I 
was paraphrasing from the stack of papers in my file by CC and others. I'm
not sure that the male gonopore necessarily dissapears in protandrous
species. However, there is frequently a change in the pleopod structure.
(Appendix masculina disappears, pleopods get broader, more ovigerous
hairs...)

The presence of AG early in development is certainly key in 
maturation as a male individual. However, there is evidence of the AG's
masculinization of the "brain" (eyestalk or y organ?) from CC and others'
work. One paper on Lysmata seticaudata suggested that spermatogenesis in
female-phase individuals did continue, but that those animals were not
able to mate as males. This suggests that the reversal is not complete.
Grafted AG's in female-phase shrimp usually resulted in the cessation
oogenesis, and masculinization.

The large body of work on "castrator parasites" (blatant plug for Jeff
Shields!) of crustaceans suggests that the degree of feminisation of
depends on the age of the host. The younger the host, the more dramatic
effects by the castrator. This suggests decreased plasticity with age in
those species.

My overall impression is that some species are more "plastic" than others
in the potential to change from male to female sex. For some, the
removal/ablation/inhibition of the androgenic gland itself may be enough
to cause sex reversal of males. For others, it may have an effect on
secondary sex characteristics (appendix masculina), but not on gonad.
Clearly there needs to be lots more work on this, and hermaphroditic
species are ideal starting points.

Crustacean reproductive endocrinology is an area that needs much further
study, as well. For example, there is still controversy (last I checked)
over what the AG hormone actually is. I think it was Hasegawa who recently
(95?) published a paper on the isolation of AG hormone, and suggested that
a species-specific assay for it was possible. However, when I wrote her
for more details, she explained that they had made a mistake. The compound
they had isolated was not AG hormone. Back to square one.

It would be nice if the picture was as clear as I had painted it
orginally. I apologize if I mislead anyone.

Curt,

Although these are your humble ramblings, they are accurate.  The 
aberrations reported in crayfish and other decapods are sometimes the 
results of physiological damage to the androgenic glands in males.  
These can be due to parasitic damage or other causes.  The norm for 
these is to be male if the androgenic gland primordia is present and 
female if not.

Murat,
I am glad to see the sudden spurt of interest in cave crustaceans on the 
list.  I am putting the finishing touches on a paper on blind cave crayfish 
oxygen consumption.

There was a recent paper on physiology of blind cave amphipods published in 
Physiological Zoology by Hervant and Mathieu et al..

Recovery of the Hypogean Niphargus rhenorhodanensis and the Epigean Gammarus 
fossarum (Crustacean:Amphipoda). Physiological Zoology 68(2)223-244.

There was a second manuscript that was related to this one, but I don't know 
if it has been published.  You can contact Frederic Hervant at:  Service de 
Physiologie du Metabolisme Intermediaire et Energetique, Universite Claude 
Bernard-Lyon I, F-69622 Villeurbanne Cedex, France.

another paper they put out is:

Steve,
    In my experience, salinity and temperature-induced changes are not
very evident in material prepared using conventional histological
fixatives like Bouin's fluid, or buffered formalin etc. Results are best
if you use a typical EM fixative (glutaraldehyde/para-formaldelyde in
sodium cacodylate buffer for example) and proceed as for electron
microscopy (fix on ice, correct pH and so on) but examine your material
in thick resin sections (0.5 micrometer). People that work with
Antarctic material often leave the tissues for up to a month in EM-like
fixatives although some extraction is sure to occur (but less than with
a typical 'histological' fixative). If you use resin-embedded sections
you could try a mixture of methylene and toluidine blue in borax (all
1%). Typical stains for paraffin-embedded material include
hematoxylin-eosin and Mallory's trichrome for example.
    You should check out some basic books on histological and electron
microscopy techniques. Hope this helps, regards, John McNamara.

Subject: CRUST-L: Hermaphroditism in Parastacus

Hi all, especially answering to Curt Fiedler,John Short, Keith Krandall,
Tom McRae and Didier Bouchon, who brought so interesting informations
about protandrous hermaphroditism in crayfish.

The genus Parastacus is represented in the Neotropics by 8 species.
Originally it was supposed that all of them have two pairs of genital
apertures (male and female simultaneously), but Rudolph (J.Crust.Biol.,
v.15.n.4, p.720-732,1995)verified that only  few specimen of Parastacus
nicoleti, from Chile, show both openings. P.nicoleti is the first
described case of protandrious hermphroditism in Astacidea. Primary
females occur in P.nicoleti, that means, specimen that never were males.
These animals show only true female openings on the coxae of the 3rd
pereiopods. But the majority of females passed through a male phase,
keeping atrophied vas deferens and male genital openings during the
female phase.

In our research group we are studying the native brazilian species
Parastacus brasiliensis (first results published: Revista Brasileira de
Zoologia v.14,n.2,p.497-509,1997) and P.nicoleti (paper in preparation).
All examined specimen, without exception, show both male and female
genital openings and two pairs of gonoducts. Some animals with ovotestis
were found during the period of reproductive inactivity. The development
of the ovarian tissue can begin on the anterior or the posterior part of
the gonads. All analysed females have a pair of atrofied (posterior) vas
deferens, suggesting that they passed anteriorly trough a male phase, as
a consequence of the activity of the androgenic hormone. All males with
full functional vas deferens have also a pair of (anterior) atrofied
oviducts, suggesting the existence of a potential possibility to become
females. There is no critical size to become females.

The gonads are totally thoracic, the two bilateral parts completely
connected on the saggital plane. The anterior part is vertically
elevated, lying just behind the stomach and surrounded by the
hepatopancreas. The posterior part lies over se intestine and under the
heart.

	Just my humble contribution.

Subject: CRUST-L: Hello there!

My name is Volker Koch, I'm doing my doctorate thesis on mangrove crabs,
mainly Ocypodidae and Grapsidae in a mangrove system in northern Brazil within
a german-brazilian research project (MADAM). The main focus of my work is on
1) community dynamics, zonation ... and on 2) secondary production, population
dynamics and consumption of the most important species. Field data were taken
between Aug.'96 and Jan.'98. I'm starting now to analyse the data and would
like to here from people who are working in the same field. I'm looking
forward to hearing from you!
Best regards
Volker

Hi Bill

In the case of the redclaw crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus we found that
the intersex individual is a functioning male with a permanently arrested
ovary.  Removal of the AG (done by my student Isam Khalaila) permitted
ovarian maturation while the testes became arrested.  I don't think that
in this case the intersex species are actually males with a damaged AG. 
 
Yours Amir

I'm looking for a method of keeping the color (of shrimp) that we collect 
and preserve.  The shrimp are collected each month but it may be months 
before we process the samples.  By then, the spot of color on Crangon 
nigromacaculata may be faded or gone.  Since it's a surefire identification 
characteristic, it would be nice to be able to see the spot a few months 
after the samples are collected.  We preserve the samples in 5% formalin on 
the boat.  Any ideas?

Someone here once threw some Sodium Benzoate crystals in a bottle with
alcohol preserved shrimp specimens. The crystals never quite dissolved all
the way, but most of the colors remained for several months, and were
still there the last time I checked.

Unfortunately, I don't know if it works with formalin or have a proper
recipe. Perhaps you can find papers on its use in fixative, or someone on
the list can ellaborate.

Good luck,

The best way to preserve the coloration patterns in crustacea is by
taking a color photo!  Then, preserve your specimens in at least 70% EtOH.
This way they have a much greater utility for future research.  Once
specimens are preserved in formalin, they become useless for DNA extraction.
Additionally, after some time, the exoskeleton becomes very brittle so
the specimens loose value for morphological analyses as well.  A photo
can become a perminant record of coloration pattern to be tied to a
specific specimen.  While I realise from personal experience that it is
not convenient to carry around a camera and associated photo equipment,
the results are well worth the effort.

cheers,

Keith Crandall

Hi 
	I don't know of a way to retain the spot, but that species is 
easy to identify using the spines at the tip of the telson- quite 
different than those in C. nigricauda and C. alaskensis.

Subject: CRUST-L: cAROTENOIDS IN HAEMOLYMPH

Hi Folks,

 I am looking at moult stage-specfic blood protein content as part of a condition study on
Southern Rock Lobster.  During this work I've noted the usual carotenoid (probably mainly
astaxanthin) staining  as the ecdysis approaches and would like to quantify this, particularly
as the onset of visible pigmentation occurs before premoult.  It may be that such a measure
could be useful in predicting the onset of premoult.  I am aware of the many other roles of
astaxanthin etc., so I'm approaching with caution.  

I would like to know if anybody has any handy hints on blood carotenoid assays?  I am using
sodium citrate as the anticoagulent (because I am also looking at crude protein) and plan to
use the appropriate extinction coefficient plus purified standards to calculate pigment
concentration after deproteinisation with perchloric acid.  Most of the literature deals with
extraction from tissue and shell samples so toluene/acetone-based extracts seem to be used
by default as they form part of the extraction cocktail.  Note that I am also using a
spectrophotometer, not HPLC.  


I would appreciate any advice,

Many thanks,

Cheers,

Richard

My name is Volker Koch, I entered the club yesterday. 
In northern Brazil (Para) I found a sesarmid crab which I identified as
Sesarma curacoense. Although I'm not a specialist in taxonomy I'm quite sure
about the identification. The other possible species (S. crassipes) is quite
different and I decided on the first. I did not find a certain account of S.
curacoense in Brazil, and it is not mentioned in the book of Schmidt de Mello.
Does anybody has an idea wether their exists a description for Brazil or
not??????

Hallo list friends,

I have approached you some while ago for advise concerning growth 
inhibitors and fungus  problems in black tiger production and got 
some good help for this problem analysis. 
However the follow up of the problems faced in those days is leading 
to further questions specially concerning contradictory 
recommendations of feeding rates , frequencies of feeding, 
distrubution of quantities for the different feeding times and so on.
We found an amazing variety in these recommendations issued by local 
experts and mainly feed sales representatives.

I am trying now to evaluate different systems and would be happy to 
collect even more ( never mind if exotic) recommendations.
I hope to to finally find a correlation between systems recommended 
by feed industry  and by water conservationists.
( Industry and scientific recommendations based more on water 
qualitiy and biology of shrimp.
 Please send or fax me any recommendation accessible to you. 
Specially related to semi- intensive culture forms of peneus monodon 
in sout east asia or elsewhere. The preliminary conditions would be :
	- stocking densities  15 - 20 Pl ( pl 15)
	- soils alluvial and unspoiled
	- sea water based  range 25 - 35 ppt salinities 

Also I would like to invite feed producers or marketing  to 
participate.

Thanks and a fruitfull farming to all

Note: if crusties (or any arthropod) are preserved in EtOH, add 5%
glycerine to the mix. This helps keep the beasts flexible, and if the
alcohol evaporates-which will happen eventually, unless very good lids are

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: Sesarma curacoense in Brazil??

Dear Volker and colleagues (especially Brazilian ones),
I am sure your identifications is correct, Volker. Sesarma curacaoense does
distribute into Brazil. For instance, the USNM has a S. curacaoense female
from Mapele (Bahia) collected by R. Rathbun.

There has been some confusion regarding material of this species and S.
crassipes from Brazil. The type material of S. crassipes Cano 1889 is
reported to be from Brazil (Pernambuco). However, it was lost and later
findings from this species in Brazil (Coelho & Ramos 1972, 1981) turned out
to be S. curacaoense (e.g. figured material in Coelho y Ramos-Porto, 1981;
see also Abele, 1992). While S. curacaoense is a widely distributed species
with a range from southern Florida through the Caribbean, Venezuela, Guianas
(and into Brazi), S. crassipes is only known from Brazil (?) and the
Caribbean coast of Costa Rica, where I had the chance of collecting it in
1996. I tend to believe that S. curacaoense is the second Sesarma species
occurring in Brazil next to S. rectum and told so Gustavo Melo in Brazil.
However, most of the museum material in Brazil still seems to be labeled as
S. crassipes.

Recently at COLACMAR (a meeting of marine biologists celebrated in Santos,
Brasil, 1997) Ariadne PRADO from Universidade Estadual Paulista Campus de
Rio Claro gave a presentation on: A OCURRENCIA DE SESARMA CURACAOENSE DE
MAN, 1892 (CRUSTACEA: BRACHURA: GRAPSIDAE) NO NORDESTE DO BRASIL. There she
states that all specimens from most Brazilian collections only consisted of
one species, S. curacaoense, expanding the distribution of this species to
Espiritu Santo.

I don't know if she's following up this investigation (she did not respond
to my mail). In any case, I would like to ask all Brazilian colleagues who
think they have Sesarma crassipes in their collections or study sites to
give those animals a careful look, compare them with Abele 1992 (Smithson.
Contrib. Zool.) or send them to me for verification. I have been trying
without success to obtain "good" S. crassipes from Brazil and would really
like to confirm its presence or absence.

Thank you,  Christoph

Please note that Phil's suggestion does not apply to animals with calcified
carapaces, such as ostracods. Adding glycerine to formaline or EtOH will
make the liquid acid, and will cause rapid decalcification of valves. When
preserving ostracods in formalin, always neutralize with sodium (bi)
carbonate, in EtOH with borax.

That probably adds to the pliability of the crustacean specimens.

But also as a cautionary note, acidic conditions in EtOH will also degrade
the DNA over time making the preservation less than idea for the uses that
Keith Crandal stated.  For that, you can also buffer the EtOH as above or
with Tris-EDTA.

But, I thought this thread was originally about preserving color for later
color morph analysis, not for general preservation techniques!

I don't know the species you are working with, but if you can look at
these guys under a dissecting scope, you should be able to tell sexes.

The pleopods of shrimp are sexually dimorphic. Male shrimp should have
longer, thin pleopods (especially #1 and #2). There is a small appendage
on the second pleopod that only males carry, however, it may be too small
to see without putting on a compound scope. Perhaps you could observe the
molts for this (ask me more if you decide to do this.)

Females have broader pleopods that may have eggs. If they are molting
regularly, observe females for the presence of eggs right after ecdysis.
You may even notice the ovary under the carapace, if exoskeleton is
transparent. It will be a green to yellow mass visible on the mid dorsal
line.

Maybe others will have more specific info on this species.

Good luck,

Curt

Subject: CRUST-L: The fry of all species in the genus Magrobrachium

Hi again

When my M. brasiliense fry hatch out they (200-300 specimens) have an
yolk sac and the female is guarding them for their fist stage.

I have raised also another M. sp. They originated from Kongo and they
(~20 specimens at the time) hatch out at bigger stage with out any yolk
sac.

Any way, both of these species doesn't have any swimming larval stage.
The fry is developped to crawl very soon after hatching.

I would like to know if this is a characteristic to this genus?

In aquarium markets have been several years some Asian transparent FW
shrimps called M. lar. The larvae of these shrimps are swimming. Am I
right if I'll say these species could rather belong to the genus
Palaemon?

Thanks

Jari Sandqvist

Hi guys

I would like to know 

1. how many described species there is in this genus?
	- at a rough estimate, how many there will be?

2. do all the larval stages of these species need sea or brackish water?
	- do C. japonica fry need salt water?

Thanks

Jari,
    the species of the genus Macorbrachium fall roughly into two groups:
hololimnetic , like M. brasiliense, which spawn and spend their entire
life cycle in freshwater; and a larger group, like M. rosenbergii, the
larvae of which, while frequently ecloding in freshwater, are completely
dependent on sea/brackish water for development to the post-larval
stage.
    Generally the few (30/female) embryos of the hololimnetic group have
a large yolk reserve, hatch in an advanced stage of development, and are
benthonic. The abundant (500+/female) larvae of the brackish water
dependent group have very few yolk reserves, and undergo a lengthy free
swimming developmental sequence.
    The genus Macrobrachium falls into the family Palaemonidae, although
the species are quite distinct from those of the genus Palaemon. See
Holthuis (1952) [Occ. Pap. Allan Hancock Found. Pub., Number 12, USC
Press] for a detailed analysis of the family in the Americas.
    I hope this helps. Regards, John McNamara.

Subject: CRUST-L: Identifying Caridinas?

Hi

How many species there is in the genus Caridina?

Is it possible at all to identify even some species of this genus just
by looking a photo?

A friend of mine is publishing soon an aquarium CD. He will put there a
photo of Caridina sp. You can see the species here:

http://www.dlc.fi/~jarvij/caridina.htm

Can he say anything more than a Caridina sp as a photo text? Could some
one of the list members identify the species?

Thanks

Subject: CRUST-L: Caridina

Jari,

There are at least 30 described species of Caridina, some of which are
of dubious status.  Many species (eg. Caridina nilotica) are in need of
taxonomic revision.

It is possible to identify some species just from photographs.  However,
because colour patterns and markings can be variable, the only certain
way of identification is by examining the specimens themselves. The
specimen in the photographs can be any of several Caridina species (eg.
Caridina japonica, C. typus, etc.) or even small specimens of the old
"Atya" group (eg. Ayopsis pilipes, juvenile Atyoida spinipes, etc.). 

Both Macrobrachium and the atyids (Caridina spp.) contain species whose
eggs hatch at different stages of larval development (ie. "normal" (8-12
larval stages, many of which are planktonic), "abbreviated" (<8 larval
stages, some of which may be planktonic) and "direct" (<3 larval stages,
none of which are planktonic and are all benthonic). Even though egg
size of a species can be highly variable, egg size can generally be an
indicator of the type of larval development the species exhibits. For
example, a species with numerous, small eggs (eg. Caridina
gracilirostris, C. typus) suggests prolonged multi-staged planktonic
development and possibly saline tolerance or requirement.  A species
with few large eggs suggests abbreviated or direct development, not
requiring saline water for development (eg. high altitude and
land-locked species generally exhibit this strategy; Caridina
nudirostris, C. fijiana).

Satish

Subject: CRUST-L: Bounced messages

> Thanks Jeff, but what means, it bounced from the list? Anything wrong with
> the address? 

For some reason I frequently get bounces from European email addresses.  A 
bounce means that a message comes to me (list administator) instead of 
directly to the list.  I usually forward the "bounced" message 
directly to the list (hence the large number of forwards from me).  I've 
tried a couple of things to minimize bounced messages.  For example, I've 
changed a switch in the software that allows the shortened use of domain 
names instead of full email addresses (full=@your.place.domain.edu; 
domain=@domain.edu).  I think the hyphen (-) in some addresses may be 
causing the software problem.  Unfortunately, I'm usually too busy to 
ferret out the problem.

If you experience a large number of bounced messages (your message 
getting forwarded by me), then you may want to unsubscribe then 
resubscribe.  In some cases your system administrator has performed a 
transparent change to your email address that is not so transparent to 
some email mailers.

Cheers, Jeff

Jari,

4 cm does seem rather large for an ovigerous C. japonica specimen.  Most
early larvae of Caridina are very similar to each other, until they get
to later stages and so the diagram may not be of much help.  The larvae
of C. japonica has been described but I doubt if it would be of much
help in your case.  

What was/is the size of the eggs?  Can you count the number of teeth on
the rostrum of your adult specimens? This may provide some clue.  Apart
from measuring the various body parts (ratios) and/or counting certain
attributes (eg. no. spines on the dactylus of the pereiopods (legs),
spines on the diaresis of the exopod of the uropod (tail fan), etc.),
there is very little that can be done to confirm the identity of a
Caridina species.

Subject: CRUST-L: SOUTH AFRICA AQUACULTURE

Hi
I have over the years had a number of anecdotal reports of Cherax spp. 
(marron and yabbies) being farmed/considered for farming in South Africa. 
Can anyone confirm whether farms in South Africa are currently producing 
marron and/or yabbies? If so,  do you know where the farms are located? and 
what levels of production are being achieved?

Regards

I'm looking for anything, scientific or popular, in the literature that

There would appear to be a dearth of information regarding this topic,
perhaps interested list members will be willing to share their personal

Subject: CRUST-L: list of journal abbreviations

Dear Crustlers,
a few days ago, there was a request for information on journal
abbreviations. I think it is very good to have such an information since
some journals require full titles and others abbreviated ones in reference
lists. So I have tried the list of URLs kindly summarized by Carlo Pipitone
for us. Trying these, I found out that the first three did not even mention
our Journal of Crustacean Biology (Helgolaender wiss. Meeresuntersuchungen
would have been much too exotic to even try). CSA is a commercial company
that does not allow for tries without subscription (ASFA etc.), and the
last url is a link to one of the German library Verbuende (joint systems
???) where I could not find anything like abbreviations of Journal titels.

So, has anyone made similar experiences or even has better suggestions
where to find such list?

Dear listfellows,
Dieter is right to a great extent. Unfortunately such online lists are far
from complete.
Anyway, while thanking Dieter for his specifications, some small
corrections to what he states (and to what I reported in my summary) are
still needed.

1) CSA site (http://www.csa.com/helpV3/ssrclist.html): you should click the
"Aquatic Sciences" link, then one of the "Search" links which appeared on
your screen (e.g. "Biological Sciences and Living Resources, ASFA-1"): this
will bring you to a search form in which you can either input the
abbreviated title or the complete title. You can even use this form in
order to search for all journals containing a particular word (e.g. CELL
will hit eight journal names). To be quicker, use the following as your
bookmark:
http://www.csa.com/htbin/srcsrch.cgi?dbs=www.csa.com+210+/wais/indexes/srcjn
l/asfa001-src .
I guess this site should be complete, because I believe it contains all the
journal names reported in ASFA.

2) the last URL must be corrected (sorry for that! something went wrong
with the bookmark!). The right one is:
http://www.brzn.de/cgi-bin/nph-wwwobnmenu?PAGE=OBNACCESS&LANG=EN&EXT=ON .
This page is in English. You should click on "GBV Online Retrieval- and
Ordersystem", and a search form will appear. Just input your abbreviation
and the complete title will/might be displayed. DO NOT TRY TO BOOKMARK THE
SEARCH PAGE - IT WILL NOT WORK! (Don't ask me why!)
:-)

Sorry for the confusion.

Regards,
Carlo

Hi
 
Maybe a stupid question: But couldn't I use the commercial aquarium fish
fry feeds for feeding the fry of shrimps? I think they mainly includes
egg yolk and yeast.

Apologies for cross-postings, but a great many folks are on only one of
these lists.

Papers are now being accepted for the new journal BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS, to
be published by Kluwer Academic Publishers (Netherlands).

The Editorial Board includes James Carlton (Editor), Ted Case, Mick Clout,
Bruce Coblentz, James Drake, Henri Dumont, Bella Galil, Francesca Gherardi,
Peter Kareiva, Mark Lonsdale,  Richard Mack, Harold Mooney, Peter Moyle,
Petr Pysek, Maria Ribera, David Richardson, Daniel Simberloff, Ronald
Thresher, Jeff Waage and Mark Williamson.

BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS seeks to publish research papers from many
disciplines, and we hope to achieve a broad representation from work done
in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial systems.   Research papers are
welcome on the patterns and processes of biological invasions (including
both human-mediated introductions and natural range expansions), the
ecological consequences of invasions in terms of both interspecific
interactions as well as alterations to community and ecosystem structure
(such as energy flow modifications, biodiversity, and invasion-mediated
extinction), the factors that influence inoculation, establishment, and
persistence of invasions and the mechanisms that control the abundance and
distribution of invasions.  Papers are further encouraged on biogeography,
invasion genetics, dispersal vectors, the evolutionary consequences of
invasions, and analytical syntheses and overviews of invasive biotas.

Also of interest are papers on the  theoretical bases of biocontrol, and
the release of genetically modified organisms, as these disciplines
illuminate the science of biological invasions.  Scholarly papers on
management and policy issues as they relate to conservation programs and
the global prevention or control of invasions are invited as well.  Please
note that, relative to biocontrol, a new journal (BIOCONTROL) is also being
established by Kluwer, under the editorship of Jeff Waage.

The Editor and the members of the Editorial Board will also consider
proposals for devoting special issues, or a special section of an issue,
to papers resulting from conferences or workshops on invasions.  We also
intend to have a section on "Research Notes", facilitating rapid
publication of short papers on topics such as new techniques, the recording
of remarkable new invasions, and so forth.

The cover of the journal, which will begin as a quarterly, will have with
each issue a new photograph (black-and-white, at the moment, unless funds
are available for color production from the authors or their institutions)
and thus provide an opportunity for workers to submit cover photos for each
issues.  There are no page charges, and the first 75 reprints are free.

Subject: CRUST-L: formula of brine shrimp flake

The market for brine shrimp flake in Chinese aquaculture industry is about
400 tons per year. There is a great population of brine shrimp Artemia in
China, especially in Tianjin region. The harvest of brine shrimp biomass in
Tianjin is about 1,000 tons (fresh weight) in Tianjin. We plan to produce
brine shrimp flake. So we are seeking the formula for brine shrimp flake
production. Any information is much appreciated.

Research Coordinator, North Inlet-Winyah Bay National Estuarine Research
Reserve          

Applications are being accepted for the position of Research Coordinator at
the North Inlet-Winyah Bay (NI-WB) NERR.  The NI-WB Reserve is operated by
the University of South Carolina through the Baruch InstituteUs Marine Field
Laboratory in Georgetown.  It is one of 22 sites in the nation comprising
the NERR System.  The Reserves are jointly funded by NOAA and state
governments to conduct research and monitoring in estuaries and to provide
information useful to coastal resource and ecosystem management.          

The Research Coordinator will be expected to:  (1) oversee and expand a
long-term, multi-disciplinary, coastal-estuarine monitoring program, (2)
coordinate existing and promote new research activities at the site, (3)
facilitate the use of scientific information for management purposes, (4)
participate in education, research, and administration programs at the site,
state, regional, and network levels, and (5) conduct independent research
within the Reserve and seek external funding.  Two additional
responsibilities will be to:  (6) develop a comprehensive site profile
document and (7) analyze and interpret extant long-term databases.          

A Ph.D. degree with a background in ecology and a familiarity with coastal
systems is required.  Advanced knowledge in the use of computers and data
(statistical) analysis and a demonstrated ability to present and publish
results are necessary.  Candidates with a commitment to field-based research
and the application of scientific information to management issues will be
favored. Strong organizational and communication skills are important.  The
position includes administrative responsibilities including supervision of
technical staff.  The appointment will be on an annual basis for at least
three years.  An appointment to the faculty of the Baruch Institute as a
Research Assistant Professor will be considered.  Salary will be
commensurate with experience; the range is from $28,000 to $36,000 plus
benefits.  The term of the appointment may be from 9 to 12 months per year
with the option of generating supplemental salary through independent
grants.  Applications should include a statement of interest, resume, and
names of three potential references.  We will begin reviewing applications
on April 27.  The position is available July 1, 1998. Please send materials
to:  Dr. Dennis M. Allen, Manager, North Inlet-Winyah Bay NERR, Baruch
Marine Field Laboratory - USC, PO Box 1630, Georgetown, SC 29442. You may

FOURTH INTERNATIONAL CRUSTACEAN CONGRESS NEWS BRIEF

As a follow-up to the announcement of last week, proper targeting for
submission of  final manuscripts needs to be clarified.  Many of us have
just managed to get our abstracts out and are now only beginning to think
of registration and hotel needs.  However, some of our more organized
colleagues have already begun to submit manuscripts for consideration in
the proceedings volumes of the congress that will come out next year.

These too seem to be coming to Amsterdam, but to send them here only delays
the log-in process and risks loss in the mails.  We have to re-package them
and send them on the chairman of the proceedings committee and chief-editor
of the proceedings volumes, Dr. Carel von Vaupel Klein.

Manuscripts for consideration in the ICC-4 proceedings volumes should be
posted directly to him:

Subject: CRUST-L: Aquaculture question


Hello

I have 114 acres of shallow (5-8 ft deep on average) bottom land (mostly
sand/mud) on the west coast of Florida, some of which is being used to
culture clams.  

I want to culture something else in the bottom land that is not being
used (about 104 acres) which I can make a profit off of.  Whether it is a
food item (blue or stone crab) or something else, I am open for
suggestions on possible uses for this bottom land.

Any ideas or discussion would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Chris Higham

Subject: CRUST-L: Varunid Recruitment

Fellow Members
We have been investigating several apsects of the recruitment of Varuna 
littorata here in South Africa. This crab lives in the lower reaches of 
rivers but has still retained a larval phase of development which occurs 
at sea. The recruitment of megalopae of this species is spectacular with 
thousands upon thousands of individuals clearly visible swimming through 
estuary mouths and upstream. At weirs and other impoundments in rivers 
huge masses of the megalopae can be found. The megalopae are by crabs 
standards very large which makes these events even more spectacular.  
I have several questions regarding varunid recruitment. Has anyone 
witnessed such intense recruitment for other varunid crabs? What about 
other crabs? Is there any literature available on such recruitment? I 
recall reading a paper on such recruitment and I think that it had to do 
with a Varuna spp, but I cannot trace the paper.
Further, we hope to rear the larvae of this crab but are having some 
problems finding gravid females. There appear to be none in the 
freshwater regions of the rivers. I have captured several females 
swimming out of the mouths of estuaries but none of them have been 
gravid. Could these crabs have been leaving the estuary for the sea to 
extrude eggs? Is anyone aware of what type of habitat these crabs would 
extrude eggs and release larvae? I presume it would need to occur in the 
lower reaches of estuaries as the probable reason that the larvae leave 
estuaries is because the larvae are unable to tolerate the low salinities 
in these systems. Is anyone aware of any publications dealing with Varuna 
spp larvae? Jose Cuesta has informed me that as far as he is aware there is 
almost no information on the larval stages of the Varuna spp. I would 
also appreciate any leads to papers dealing with adult ecology and 
biology.  
Yours

First Call for Proposals
Access to the Large Scale Facility
Sandgerdi Marine Centre
The Sandgerdi Marine Centre in Iceland has been granted the status of Large
Scale Facility under the TMR programme of the European Commission.

The main attraction of the SMC is access to the unique collection of benthic
invertebrates from the international BIOICE project (Benthic Invertebrates
of Icelandic Waters) which has been operated since 1992.  During this time
more than 1000 composite samples have been systematically collected in
Icelandic waters, at depths from 20 to 2400m.  The collection of samples is
still in progress.  The initial stages of sorting have been carried out,
providing an accessible array of most major taxa of benthic invertebrates.

The SMC also offers access to a wet-lab with running seawater of exceptional
quality.  This seawater (constantly 9=B0C, salinity 32.05 PSU) originates=
 from
a well at 50m depth in the lava-field and is totally contaminant-free.=20

The SMC is located in Sandgerdi, a small fishing village on the southwest
coast of Iceland (50 km from the capital city, Reykjavik) with excellent
facilities for work in a friendly atmosphere. The seashore around the lab
harbours a great variety of shore organisms which are easily attainable
during low tide (approximately 3.5 m tidal range). =20

For further information and application forms see our web site
http://www.hi.is/pub/smc.=20

Scientists from CEC member states and associated states (Norway,
Liechtenstein and Israel; Switzerland in negotiation) except from Iceland
may submit proposals.  Proposals for the first call should be sent as soon
as possible, but by 31.05.1998 at the latest, to the Project Manager of The
Sandgerdi Marine Centre (Gudmundur V. Helgason, Institute of Biology,
University of Iceland, Grensasvegur 12, IS-108 Reykjavik, Iceland, E-mail:
gudmvid@hi.is).

Subject: CRUST-L: Re: Reply Aquaculture question

Dear Chris:

Your question about how to use the 100 acres of Florida bottom land that
you own and which "is not being used" is legitimate and reasonable.
Please do not think that my reply is meant to be mean spirited, but
having been a Peace Corps Volunteer in South East Asia and seen what
mariculture activities do to natural wetlands ecosystems, my gut
reaction to your question is one of spiritual pain. Using dozers to push
up earth to entrap bodies of water in which fertilizer is dumped to grow
algae which are eaten by harvestable animals such as crabs and fish
causes irreversible damage to irreplaceable wetlands. I am not sure the
profit margin on such operations in the U.S. would be large. You may not
be able to compete. Most shrimp sold in the US is imported in from third
world countries where the labor costs are low. Would it be possible to
use of the property in way that would minimize habitat damage, such as a
restaurant or burger-and-beer place utilizing the view to attract
customers?

I might further suggest... use a small proportion of the land for 
something money making as Jack suggests and consider putting the rest of 
the land in some protective covenant with the government or a private 
organization. There are a number of programs which will either pay you 
for the protection of wetland habitat or provide you with tax benefits or 
both. This approach could turn out the best for all in the long run. Just 
a thought.

Subject: CRUST-L: Re: Varunid Recruitment

Dear Brent,

        Though I have not directly witnessed intense recruitment as you
described for varunid crabs, such phenomenon appears to be very common among
crab species. Apart from those reported in literature, I myself wintnessed
such phenomenon for various species during field samplings. It seems to be
the result of crab megalopae perform synchronized active swmming at certain
time of tidal cycles to ride on onshore  (or upstream) flows of flood tides
for recruitment, such phenomenon also known as Selective tidal Stream
Transport (I felt that in coastal waters, apart from tidal currents,
megalopae may also use similar machenism to utilize other predictable flows
generated by different physical forces). This has been well documented in
estuarine crab megalopae and you may refer to some recent publications and
literatures cited in those papers for more details.

De Vries MC et al (1994) Abundance of estuarine crab larvae is associated
with tidal hydrologic variables. Mar Biol 118:403-413

Zeng C & Naylor E (1996) Occurrence in coastal waters and endogenous tidal
swimming rhythms of late megalopae of shore crab Carcinus: implications for
onshre recruitment. Mar Ecol Prog Ser 136:69-79

        As to your second question about ovigerous crab, you may right that
your crab migrates to sea for spawning. Such phenomenon has been reported in
commercially important crab Scylla serrata and Carcinus (to less extent,
migrate to lower esutary for spawning):

Hill, B-J (1994) Offshore spawning by the portunid crab Scylla serrata
(Crustacea: Decapoda). Mar Biol 120(3): 379-385

Queiroga H et al (1994) Larval abundance patterns of Carcinus in Canal de
Mira. Mar Ecol Prog Ser 111:63-72

        Besides salinity reasons, the fundamentally course for such offshore
spawning may rest on avoidance of planktivorous fishes which aboundance in
estuaries. You could refer to Morgan's papers if you are interested.

Morgan SG & Christy JS (1997) Planktivorous fishes as selective agents for
reproductive synchrony.	Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology
209(1-2): 89-101

Morgan SG (1987) Adaptive significance of hatching rhythms and dispersal
patterns of estuarine crab larvae: Avoidance of physiological stress by
larval export?	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY 113(1): 71-78

        As to habitat for crab to extrude eggs, from my experience with
several crabs, it appears a fine sand or mud substraum is a good one. The
reason for this is that crabs normally need to dig into substraum to form
hollow area so that they can force newly extruded eggs to attach to their
pleopods. Although in Scylla serrata, ovigerous crab are rarelly found in
estuaries and coastal waters, however, to reach deep water seems not a
pre-requesition for the crab to spawn. We obtained many ovigerous crabs by
simply kept matured femals in small tanks (as small as 0.5 square meter)
provided with sand substraum. The rates of females extruded their eggs were
very high (near 100%) and you may try out this with your Varunid crab.

Hope above information could be some help to you, 

Best wishes, Chaoshu

Brent,
The paper you are probably referring to is: Ryan, P.A. and Choy, S.C.
1990. Observations on the mass migration of Varuna litterata
....CRUSTACEANA, 58(3): 237-249. Other relevant literature are cited in
this paper.

Since writing that paper, I have collected berried females of V.
literrata from estuarine areas. In Borneo, I collected a few that were
found clinging to floating mangrove (Rhizophora spp.) leaves in
estuaries.

Subject: CRUST-L: Query abound cave crab

 Dear Crusties,

	 I've just had the following request passed to me by Science Line, a science information organisation that 
fields questions from the public and tries to find answers.  Has anyone any ideas about this one?

Peter Hogarth

Dear Dr Hogarth

We've had a question here at Science Line which I hope you might be able to
help us with. A caller has seen a crab which is called the Blind Cave Crab,
which she thinks is mainly found in the United States and she wanted to
know its Latin name. We couldn't find this name in any of our books. She
gave a brief description of it. It is definitely not a spider crab and has
very long legs. Its body is heart shaped being broader near the eyes and
narrower at its end and its is a pale colour. Perhaps you might know what
she is referring to?

Thanks for your help.
Nicola

INFORMATION OF THE KMRS BELOW:

A unique location since 1877. Unique resources since 1994

Kristineberg Marine Research Station (KMRS), run jointly by the
Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and G=F6teborg University, is one of
the most modern marine stations in the world. The station is
situated at the mouth of the 120 m-deep Gullmars fjord, offering
convenient access to a rich and diverse flora and fauna and
facilitating the collection and transfer of marine organisms. The
station was renovated in 1994, and now includes exceptionally modern
laboratory facilities, offices for resident and guest scientists and
a unique large scale experimental facility.

The primary aim of the station is to provide high quality working
facilities for both Swedish and foreign guest scientists, and KMRS
has a permanent staff of 15 faculty and 25 graduate students. In
addition, the station provides facilities for undergraduate and
other marine courses, as well as hosting regular scientific
meetings.
Research at KMRS encompasses a wide field of marine biology and
physical-chemical oceanograhy, but also includes geology, medicine,
pharmacology and applied technology. The station is open all year
round to scientists at all levels and from all countries. 

Facilities at KMRS

The station consists of two laboratory buildings, two research
vessels and a hotel unit. The laboratory buildings covering 5 000 m2
are fully equipped and comprise experimental rooms, an auditorium,
several conference rooms, offices and a library. Our technical staff
and research engineers are experienced and can give advice about the
use of equipment. In our workshops we make and maintain high
precision field equipment.       

Two research vessels, of the stern-trawler type, are operated by
KMRS. The R/V Arne Tiselius (30 m) is specially designed and
equipped for marine research with emphasis on biological
oceanography, benthic ecology and benthic/pelagic monitoring. The
R/V Oscar von Sydow (12 m) is ideal for the collecting of marine
animals. A number of small boats are also available for use at the
station. The boat crews have extensive knowledge of the local marine
environment and the distribution of marine species and have long
experience of collecting animals for experimental research.

KMRS has a fully equipped SCUBA facility, and diving forms an
important part of the marine research at the station.

The library keeps most marine journals and is well provided with
species identification literature and handbooks. We also have an
extensive reprint collection dating back to the late 19th century.
If additional literature is needed, KMRS has a 24-hour document
delivery service available.

At the station there is lso a data-bank to simplify the collection
and identification of marine organisms. The data-bank provides
detailed information on collection sites for most invertebrate
species and algae in the region.

The hotel unit can comfortable accommodate groups of up to 50, and
offers self-catering or full board facilities. Easy access to a rich
and diverse flora and fauna

The Gullmars fjord, with a maximum depth of 120 metres, has an 
extremely rich flora and fauna due to the great diversity of habitats 
- - all available within 30 minutes sail from the station. In some 
areas vertical rocks reach down more than 40 meters and h t a rich 
flora of macroalgae as well as sessile and mobile animals. These 
rocks are ideal for research by means of SCUBA diving. Between the 
rocky areas,  both sand and clay seabed habitats extend down to the 
deep basin.

KMRS is situated in a unique marine environment. The surface water
down to about 15 - 20 metres is brackish (salinity is about 25 psu)
and of Baltic origin. Below this is higher salinity water
originating from the Skagerrak and the North Sea. 

Modern equipment and instrumentation 
The entire first floor of the new building is designed to provide
state-of-the-art experimental conditions. The research vessels dock
at the main laboratory entrance enabling undisturbed animal or
sediment samples to be brought into the experimental rooms easily -a
unique feature of KMRS.

KMRS has eleven wet laboratories, ranging in size from 15 to 100 m2,
and five of these rooms offer full control of both air and water
temperature. Each experimental laboratory has a separate control
room for computer equipment  and data collection. Technical
inventories within the experimental rooms are flexible, allowing
equipment to be moved between rooms to allow the design of complex
experiments. 

Three light- and temperature-controlled rooms for algal culturing
and a flume tank are also available.

The second and third floors contain well-equipped, special designed
laboratories for physiology, ecology, microbiology, sedimentology,
chemistry and radioisotope handling. Modern basic instruments are
available, and our technical staff can help guests with chemical
analyses and most practical problems.

Throughout the laboratory, 2 separate sea water systems provide
clean water from the fjord. Surface water from 6 m is used to mimic
variable shallow water conditions, whereas deep water from 30 m
provides a stable environment year round. Both water systems are
installed in all laboratories as well as in the experimental rooms.

Subject: CRUST-L: Commercially available myosins from Crustacea??

Dear All,

does anyone know of any commercially available Crustacean myosins that
could be used for parasitic-protease breakdown studies. If there are none
available, is it likely that using myosin from another animal (e.g.
rat/rabbit) would show similar breakdown when challenged with the
proteases....i.e. how conserved are the myosins in different species?.   I
am working on the deep abdominal flexor muscle of the Norway Losbter
(Nephrops norvegicus)...this muscle is homogenous fast type.

Thanks alot

Subject: CRUST-L: toxic crusties

An article in the new American Scientist by Jim McClintock prompts me to
wonder how many crusties use defensive (or even offensive) toxins?
McClintock, J.B. and B.J. Baker. 1998. Chemical Ecology in Antarctic Seas.
American Scientist 86(3):254-263.

A specific point is Hyperiella abducting Clione and carrying the pteropods
around on their backs. Seems the Clione posses and nice toxin, and the
Hyperielled uses this for protection. (First reported in McClintock J.B.
and J. Janssen. 1990. Pteropod abduction as a chemical defense in a pelagic
antarctic amphipod. Nature 346:462-464.

Similar to the crabs that carry around sea anemones, except here the Clione
do *not* benefit from the association. The opposite, in fact.

But-do crusties have their *own* toxins? If not synthesized by themselves,
at least sequestered from their food, such as sponges or corals, etc. Like
insects do with toxic plants.

Then of course, there's the question of venoms. Caprellids supposedly have
venom glands in their 2nd gnathopods, but has this been shown true or
false? Any other crusties with venom? If no, why not? Venom is common
enough.

	Among the herbivorous amphipods, many of which do consume algae rich in
secondary metabolites, there are, to my knowledge, no published examples of
chemical sequestration like that found in terrestrial insects or other marine
herbivores such as sea hares. Neither have I heard of any examples of
equestration from other chemically rich hosts such as sponges, soft corals or bryozoans.
	There is one system analogous to McClintock's in which an ampithoid
(Pseudamphithoides incurvaria) carries around a small house made of an alga
(Dictyota) unpalatable to fish. See Hay et al (1990) Host-plant specialization
decreases predation on a marine amphipod: an herbivore in plant's clothing.
Ecology 71: 733-743 for details.

Dear fellows,

Does anyone know at which period of female copepod gametogenesis occur the
multiplication of follicle cells?
I am specially interested to know when this process hapen regarding to the
molt of copepodite V to adult females.
If anybody have some references concerning this process in other crustacea,
I will be as well very interested to know.

Bruce Felgenhaur (sp?) presented the poster at TCS meeting.  I think 
there is good circumstantial evidence that the remipedes have a toxin 
producing mandibular (?) organ.  Don't know if the paper's been published 
yet.

I think the poisonous crabs from the South Pacific obtain their toxin from 
eating algae, cf. ciguatera.

Subject: CRUST-L: Mole Crab Info Request


I work in the Benthic Ecology Program at Mote MArine Laboratory and
recieved a call from a high school student on the west coast of Florida.
He was wondering why the Mole Crabs < Emerita) seem to have dissappeared.
Does any one have any information on Emerita's -
	1. Living habits - do they ever go into deeper water? 
	2. Has anyone studied the effects of beach restoration projects on
populations of Emeritas
	3. We have had a very windy year this year - could this be a
possible explaination.

Over the last few years, some of my volunteers who are avid fisherman have
also noticed a declined in availabilty of mole crabs(one of their favorite
fishing baits) on our local beaches.


I would welcome any comments or suggestions of literature which may help
me out.

Thanks,

Debi,

Just a couple quick observations. First, Emerita are seasonal, even in
Florida, and are often hard to find before May. Second, it has been
documented that mole crab abundance is negatively impacted by heavy foot
traffic (can't recall the reference offhand). Third, these critters are
pretty nomadic and gregarious, conditions which favor high interannual
variability in local abundance (e.g., see some of Adrian Wenner's work in
the 1960's).

	There are at least two species of amphipods in the Pacific 
Northwest that appear to utilize chemical defenses.  Both are very boldly 
marked, sit right out in the open, and are rejected when offered to 
fish.  When stressed they release a brownish liquid from the mouth, much 
like the "spit" from grasshoppers (which contains toxins sequestered from 
plants).  A fish ecologist, Steve Norton, has done quite a bit of work on 
these amphipods but I don't know of any published information yet.

	I will try to help answering some of your questions. From our
cDNA sequence data on Penaeus monodon, some of our clones which we
classified as myosin (heavy chain) showed some 67-75 % sequence similarity
to that of a Drosophila melanogaster one. The similarity would be less to
those of mammalian ones. Hope this give you some idea.

Subject: CRUST-L: PhD application

Dear Readers,	

RE: PhD Position

 My name is James Williams and I am a final year Hons Biology student
 at the University of Nottingham, U.K. I am writing to enquire about
 research PhD studentships. During an inter-calated year out (academic
 year 1996/97), I worked at the Oceanarium in St.David's,
 Pembrokeshire (U.K.) in order to gain first-hand experience of
 Atlantic marine life and the fishing industry. My final year research
 project has involved studying moult-associated changes in the muscle
 tissues of the Edible Crab, Cancer pagurus. I am extremely keen to
 continue research in marine species, particularly those of relevance
 to commercial fisheries.

 I would be very grateful if you could reply with details of
 appropriate PhD studentships available which you may know of,
 together with details of the application procedure. Pasted below are
 my CV and a brief summary of the current crab project for your
 perusal. I would also greatly appreciate it if this information could
 be forwarded to prospective PhD supervisors.

 I shall be very pleased to hear from you at your earliest
 convenience,

Yours Sincerely,

James Williams.


The Effect of The Moulting Cycle on the Quality of Crab Meat

General
 This preliminary study is being carried out by James Williams as a
 Third Year Project and will contribute to his finals in Hons Biology
 at the University of Nottingham. During an inter-calated year out
 (academic year 1996/97), James worked at the Oceanarium in
 St.David's, Pembrokeshire under the supervision of Mr.Gary Cross, the
 Director. In spare time, James  researched aspects of crab biology of
 relevance to the shellfish industry, and in particular in ways of
 discriminating between individuals rich in meat and those with little
 meat. Studies were conducted on the European Edible Crab, Cancer
 pagurus. The intermoult stages of Brachyurans appears to be critical
 in determining meat content and quality. The major phase of this
 project is concerned with looking at the cellular and molecular
 changes underlying these tissue alterations. The supervisor for these
 studies is Dr.Mike J.Dowdall, a Biochemist with research interests in
 cell physiology and with considerable experience in working with
 marine species. He has spent a total of eight summers working at the
 Marine Biological Laboratory at Woods Hole and has been a member of
 their corporation since 1974.

Research
 Literature searches reveal that virtually nothing has been published
 on the cellular and molecular changes occurring in crab muscle during
 the intermoult period between consecutive moults (ecdyses). This in
 itself is very surprising, since during each cycle there must be
 massive changes in the cellular architecture which must be reflected
 in biochemical ones. These changes must be comparable to those which
 are seen generally in animal development. It is known that
 developmental changes involve a constant, ongoing re-organisation of
 the cellular populations and this is achieved by alterations in the
 expression of different families of proteins encoded for by the
 genotype (co-ordinate gene switching). Post-development, a more
 stable phenotype emerges and gene-switching on this scale is not seen
 - although it still occurs periodically in specialised tissues (e.g.
 those under control by hormones of the steroid category). The
 moulting process in arthropods is known to be regulated by hormones
 of the ecdysone family and indeed co-ordinate gene switching was
 first demonstrated in insects. In insects the spectrum of gene
 products (proteins) after ecdysone treatment is quite different from
 that seen before.

 It has therefore been proposed that changes in protein expression be
 looked for in crab muscle as a function of the "moult-cycle stage".
 Accurate moult-staging is a major problem faced by the shellfish
 industry and academics alike; traditionally, it has been  impossible
 to accurately predict meat quality and content of intermoult crabs.
 After recognition of this problem, which has both major ecological
 and economic implications for the fishery, a novel quantitative
 method for moult-staging was recently devised and has been used in
 this study. This was developed at the Oceanarium and depends on total
 body mass of the crab relative to its size. A commercially available
 electronic device for this ("Crab-Check") is currently under
 development.

 The biochemical measurements involved in this project focus on the
 activities of a number of key enzymes which are likely to change
 during the re-organisation of muscle in the cycle. These are
 mitochondrial, lysosomal and cytoplasmic enzymes (e.g. fumarase, acid
 phosphatase and alanine-pyruvate transaminase) and also include those
 which are important to the energetics of normal muscle function (e.g.
 arginine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase). In addition, activities
 not normally found in muscle, but present in tissues which are
 nutrient donors, are also being measured (e.g. alkaline phosphatase).
 These may be correlated to muscle tissue wet / dry masses, protein
 content, and to measurements of muscle changes which occur during
 cooking of crabs at the various stages. The biochemical information
 might help to focus on the specific changes occurring in the muscle
 tissue during the cycle; these may ultimately and importantly relate
 to meat content and quality.

 Experimental Design
 Muscle of the crab claw is used as being representative of the whole
 muscle mass of the crab. Mr.Gary Cross co-ordinated the arrangements
 for obtaining crabs from local commercial fishermen, and a sample of
 45 crabs were caught for the study on a trip during December 1997.
 Prior to collection, pilot experiments on enzyme activity in Shore
 Crab (Carcinus maenas) muscle were conducted in Nottingham on fresh
 material. These were designed to test optimal conditions for tissue
 homogenisation and low temperature storage, as well as establishing
 =91baseline=92 activities of the specific enzymes studied. The C. pagurus
 collection involved measuring mass and size dimensions of the crabs,
 followed by removal and freezing of claws from 25 =91calibrated=92
 individuals. These were transported to Nottingham for laboratory
 analysis. Claw tissue homogenates were made for each crab and are
 stored at -80=B0C. This material forms the tissue bank from which data
 sets on individual enzyme activities and other muscle proteins are
 being established. The 25 crabs selected fall into groups of
 individuals at different stages in the intermoult cycle, and hence it
 should be possible to determine the biochemical basis for the
 large-scale changes which occur. 

Funding
This project is funded by the Shellfish Association of Great 
Britain..

Subject: CRUST-L: Southern African Decapod Larval Works

Fellow Members
A colleague and I are collaborating on a review paper entitled The Past, 
Present and Future of Decapod Crustacean Larval Research in Southern 
Africa. In this respect we would like to have access to all the relevant 
research in this field for this subregion. We have access to all (we 
think) the relevant research conducted by South African scientists (which 
by the way is minimal) and will shortly be in contact with all marine and 
estuarine researchers in South Africa to gain an indication of present 
research projects and foci. This message is therefore aimed primarily at 
foreign researchers. I am aware of several foreigners who have and are 
conducting work on Decapods in Africa south of the equator. I am not 
however certain as to whether there is a larval component to any of this 
research, and would appreciate a response from anyone working in this 
field, irrespective of the spp concerned and the type of work conducted, 
just so long as it involves decapod larvae in the southern African 
region. Any work that may have been done in the past would also be 
appreciated as well as the addresses of workers who may not subscribe to 
the newsgroup. Furthermore, if anyone has or knows of work planned for 
the future, I would also appreciate information in this respect.
For the purposes of this paper we have set the limits of Southern Africa 
as being the Cunene River (border between Namibia and Angola) on the west 
coast and the same approximate latitude on the east coast (ie just north 
of Beira, Mocambique).
I feel that it is probably best that respondents reply to me directly via 
email and I will then supply a summary of the info I received to the 
newsgroup should anyone be interested. 
Yours

Subject: CRUST-L: Thalassinid Larval Starvation Resistance

Fellow members
I have been conducting research (as part of a PhD) on the starvation 
resistance capabilities of Upogebia afrivana larve (Point of Reserve 
Saturation and No Return (PRS and PNR) and cyclic (patchy) food 
regimens). As some of you may be aware the literature in this respect is 
expanding, particularly for brachyuran crabs (see several papers by Klaus 
Anger and co-workers). However, as far as I am aware, there are only four 
references in this respect for thalssinid larvae viz Thessalou-Legaki wt 
al. 1992. Effects of starvation and food density on the larval development 
of Calianassa tyrrhena (Decapoda, Thalassinidea); Forbes: Callianassa 
krausii - PhD and Descriptive paper; Shy and Chan, 1996. Complete larval 
develpment of the edible mud shrimp Upogebia edulis Ngoc-Ho and Chan; 
Gurney, 1937. Notes on some decapod crustacea from the Red Sea.II The 
larvae of Upogebia savignyi Strahl. Could any members tell me whether I 
have missed any references? I realise that this newsgroup is not the 
forum for a quick literature search, but a literature search by keywords 
would not have revealed the last three mentioned works as they mention 
merely as anecdotal info that these larvae are highly lecithotrophic and 
do not need to feed throughout development. My literature search also 
suggests that our general understanding of thalssinid larval ecology is 
almost non existent (excluding larval morphology). Can anyone else 
confirm this?
Looking forward to hearing from you
Brent

   Unlikely, as they depend on wave action to filter feed.[*] I know of 
no reports of Emerita going subtidal.

[*] There may be some species variability in whether Emerita 
can feed in still water. West coat E. analoga can, but I hear the 
Atlantic species can't.

   Possibly. In discussions with Jenny Dugan and Dave Hubard at UC 
Santa Barbara, they described beaches being "scoured" by wind during 
the winter and, not surprisingly, Emerita were hard to find there for 
a while.

Debi and gang:

	On the beach here (Latitude 45=BA48'N) we have <Emerita analoga>  almost
every year, but never through the winter. Right about now the first few
small individuals are starting to show up (from California?). Typically,
tiny ones arrive in the spring and the size of the population and
individuals both increse through the summer. Occasionally, though, the
beach remains devoid of them all year. Two years ago, the only time I
have seen it, the population underwent synchronous molting, so there
were literally millions of cast shells in windrows along the beach. By
sometime in the fall each year, they are all gone. So far as I know, no
one has studied the population dynamics, so it remains unknown whether
the crabs migrate south in the winter, or they die out and larvae of
another population are carried in anew from somewhere to the south each
spring. Possibly something similar happens to your population.

I think it's required by law, in an Immigration Act or something. No taxon
can  disperse to or evolve in Australia unless a certain percent are either
toxic or venomous.

Lobbied in by the breweries, I think. Something to ease the mind while you

But is this, and similar reports, just happenstance? The crabs eat
poisonous plants, and so become poisonous, or are the crabs actually
*selecting* toxic plants to eat in order to acquire the toxics for their
own use as defensive chemicals?

Unless the toxic crabs are young stages subject to predation by rats,
seabirds, and older crabs, I would suspect the former. The crabs eat toxic
plants, aren't killed by the experience, and become toxic themselves,
ho-hum. Like people and garlic. (Or *married* people and garlic.)

Actually, there's pretty good circumstantial evidence of this. I don't
know if Birgus are eating to avoid predation, but on islands where this
family of plants is common, natives will tie up Birgus or put them in a
drum for several days to cleanse their systems.

There is also a paper testing the toxicity of Birgus tissue fractions to
mice, and the hepatopancreas of these crabs was quite poisonous. It wasn't
clear which plant was involved.

I looked into this literature to prepare a (unfunded) proposal examining
the effect of rat poison or Birgus. I recall there was a Holthuis paper on
toxic crustaceans too. I'll dig up the bibiography and post it.

Rats often eat young crabs, and older crabs often eat rats. It seems that
the plant alkaloids involved did not affect the crab much, but can have an
effect on vertebrates.

Curt,

The plant family wasn't mentioned. Or the gingko's not doing its job. Which
toxic plants are the crabs eating?

If the crabs are just toxic because they're eating toxic plants, and
they're not actually selecting the plants for defensive purposes, you'd
expect the hepatopancreas to be toxic, and nothing else. If the crabs were
selecting toxic plants, I would predict that they would pump toxin into
their leg muscles and maybe hemolymph. This would do them some good for
defense-sacrifice a leg to the predator, and get away. Just having a poison
hepatopancreas won't help much without warning coloration.

How much crab cannibalism is there?

Subject: CRUST-L: Re: Toxic crustaceans

In the review that Neil Bruce referred to we recorded 22 species of crabs
in 5 families that had toxins in the flesh. Most are Xanthidae, but
Portunidae, Grapsidae, Majidae, and Parthenopidae were also represented.  
Toxins identified include Saxitoxin, Paralytic Shellfish Poisons,
Tetrodotoxin, and Palytoxin.  

Our belief is that all these types of toxin are taken in via the food
chain - some seem to be reliably poisonous (such as at least some Demania
species), while for most, toxicity varies according to place and probably
season. In general we felt that most small coral reef crabs should be
treated with suspicion.  Grazers are presumably going to be the most
likely to pick up toxins, but predators such as Thalamita (Portunidae)
also had toxins, so in some cases amplification may occur.

I haven't looked at the literature for a while but it seems there are no
records of this phenomenon outside the Indo-West Pacific. With so many
toxins involved, one would expect this process to be happening on
Carribean reefs as well. Has anyone ever looked I wonder?

Dear Brent

Indeed there is a lot of information on thalassinid larval ecology 
that is missing! Some hints for larval  food independence are given 
also in
- -Nantes et al. 1997. J. Crust. Biol. 17: 497-519
Direct larval development is suspected for C. subterranea in 
- -Rowden @ Jones 1994. J. mar. biol. Ass. U.K. 74: 623-635.
- -Tamaki et al. 1996 J. mar. biol. Ass. U.K. 76:675-689 as well as 
- -Nantes et al. 1997 summarise larval periods for callianassid species. 
My opinion is that species with abbreviated development with two or 
three zoeal stages should exhibit some kind of lecithotrophy-not 
yet docummented.
For example in our experiments with larvae of C. tyrrhena  it seems that facultative 
lecithotrophy is exhibited during larval development and it is  more pronounced 
in Zoea I. Full results of our presentation of 1992 have been 
submitted for publication- hopfully during this year. 

As for general ecological aspects of larval thalassinids (tidal 
exchange in estuaries) I suppose you have already come across
- -Johnson & Gonor 1982. Estuar. coastl Shelf Sci. 14:501-516 and
- -Emmerson 1983. S. Afr. J. Zool. 18: 326-330.

I wish you good luck with thalassinids
Best regards
Maria

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: toxic crusties

	An interesting question...  Looking at some of the unpublished
examples of chemically defended crustaceans that have been mentioned here
makes you wonder if the lack of reports is because we have not looked hard
enough.  My recollection is that only pea crabs have been claimed to
produce chemical defenses of any sort (this is in JEMBE, but I can't
remember the year nor the authors). A particular mucus film on the
carapace of the crab was argued to serve as defense, and it was only found
on one of the larval stages.  However, this paper lacked the critical
tests that would conclusively demonstrate the presence of a chemical
defense. 
	For those larger crabs that have been claimed toxic, the
accumulation of dinoflagellate metabolites is often responsible for the
reports, most of which deal with medical cases (I did not know about
Birgus latro, though).  Whether this has an antipredatory effect in nature
it is unknown.  It certainly would mean death to the crab, since the
toxins accumulate inside the body. Unless there is kin selection, this
would not be much of an effective strategy.  However, if there is
sublethal predation, this may work.  It is not unusual for a crab to lose
a leg or two, and if the predators learn to avoid the animal there may be
a net benefit.  A similar argument has been made by Rikk Kvitek and
coworkers about butter clams which accumulate dinoflagellate toxins, and
which suffer from siphon nipping by natural enemies (Kvitekk and Beitler.
1988. J. Mar. Res. 4:629-636; Kvitekk.  1991.  Mar. Biol.  111:369-374). 
I don't know of similar studies conducted on crustaceans. 
	As far as "behavioral sequestration", a term often used to
describe cases like Philip Oshel and Alistair Poore mention, in which
defense is by association, there are a few reports.  As Alistair pointed
out, the amphipod Pseudoampithoides incurvaria makes a domicile from a
chemically defended alga (Dictyota bartrayesii)and gets protection from
fish.  Interestingly, Barnard and Karaman (1991) mention that both
Pseudoampithoides species described show the same behavior, but the
chemistry of the interaction has only been studied in the case of P.
incurvaria (Hay et al. 1990).
	McClintock's pteropod abduction by a hyperiid amphipod is similar. 
However, only a percentage of the amphipods in that paper had pteropods,
and I have been told that these amphipods will carry on their backs a
number of different things, so the chemical defense could be fortuitous. 
More recently, a friend of mine has demonstrated that the decorator crab,
Libinia dubia, will selectively cover itself with a chemically defended
brown seaweed, and that the chemical compound that deters feeding in fish
is the one that stimulates decoration. That paper is in press in Ecology. 
Something similar could be happening with hermit crabs that gain added
defense when their shells are covered by hydroids or with anemones, but
again, the chemistry remains to be studied.
	As Philip Oshel notes, it is interesting to see that
sequestration, which is so common in other arthropods, appears to be so
rare in crustaceans.  I wonder if anyone would care to comment on why that
may be.  Are the anatomical or metabolic adaptations that allow insects to
sequester metabolites, missing from crustaceans?  Intuitively I would say
yes, but I would rather hear it from someone who knows.  I doubt we know
enough about crustacean physiology for some of the more exotic, non
comercially important groups, but we know a fair deal about crustacean
physiology for several of the larger species, as well as insects.  Any
ideas, any takers?

Subject: CRUST-L: biodiversity and research

Some news which may interest crustys because crustaceans are one of the most
widespread components of biodiversity:

1. A European Science Foundation study group has recently produced a plan
for marine biodiversity research. It is available on the web at:
http://www.esf.org/mpb/Marbio.html

2.  The Communication of the European Commission to its Parliament
concerning how the Convention on Biological Diversity would be implemented
by the European Union is available at
http://europa.eu.int:80/en/comm/dg11/docum/9842en.pdf
This is a most important document and covers all sectors, including research.
An email conference to discuss this communication will be starting soon (See
point 4 below).

3. The European Commission environmental research section of DGXII funded a
Working Group on Research and Biodiversity (EWGRB) in 1997 which produced a
report available on the world wide web. This report is being used to direct
research funding on biodiversity in  Europe.  Information is available on
the web at
http://www.oden.se/~ewgrb
http://www.algonet.se/~bear
http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/Spa/5711/index.html
There was limited marine and freshwater input to this group. However it is
still possible to contribute to its debate through an electronic conference
which has led on from the EWGRB to start shortly (see point 4 below). I will
be chairing the 'fisheries' section but the scope of this is as wide as we
wish, i.e. all marine activities which may be affected by or may be effected
by fisheries.  Offers of contributions are very welcome.

4. An electronic conference to discuss biodiversity research needs is to be
held from 4 May until 16 June 1998. One can participate by 

(a) joining an email discussion group (i.e. a 'listserver' where messages
sent to a single address are automatically bounced back to all persons who
have 'subscribed').
You can subscribe to the email listserver by sending the message SUBSCRIBE
BIODIV <first name> <surname> to listserver@e-mail.gencat.es, or through the
web site (see below).  You will receive an automatic reply providing
additional instructions. 

(b) visiting (reading) the web site <http://www.gencat.es/mediamb/biodiv>
and making contributions to the 'discussion Forum'  via this same web site. 
        
5. The European Commission Statistical Office in collaboration with the
 European Environment Agency has produced a suite of indicators of pressures
 on the environment covering all sectors.  A full list of the methodology for
 deriving each indicator is available at Eurostat indicators of pressure on
marine and coastal biodiversity (http://www.telecom.es/tau/sheets.htm).  

good reading
Mark.

For whatever it is worth, on the island of Mauke (Cook Islands), the spiny

I agree here, especially when I consider the results from my experiments. 
Upogebia africana larvae show a really high degree of lecithotrophy, 
although larval development is not completely lecithotrophic, again here 
facultative lecithotrophy is NB as the effects of starvation are clearly 
evident on later development. 
Interestingly, a fourth zoeal stage appears under intense starvation. 
I am nearing the completion of this work and will send you a copy of the 
chapter for my PhD thesis and would appreciate it if you could provide 
comments.

Brent

Dear fellow Crusters

I am looking for someone who has experience in the field of 
crustacean molecular systematics who might be interested in joining 
our research group as a post-doc for 1-2 years starting 1999.  
Projects which the post doc can get involved with include the 
phylogenetic relationships of the potamonautid river crabs of 
southern Africa, phylogenetic relationships within the the dromiid 
sponge crabs, or the molecular systematics of the phreatoicidean 
isopods.

If you are interested, give me a shout!

Hi phil!

	Regarding venomous caprellids. You are probably referring 
to a publication of  Wetzel (1932) who reported that  a spine on the 
second pair of gnathopods was connected to glandular tissue and that 
this appeared to be venomous in nature.  Additional 
evidence was provided by Costa (1960) stating that the prey of 
Phtisica mariner was unable to struggle shortly after being seized, 
thus indicating venom being introduced.	
	However this is only cercumstancial evidence, since most caprellid 
species do not use the second gnathopods in capturing  prey, but the 
first gnathopods and the antennas.  Another problem is that the term 
poison tooth was used by P. Mayer 40 years before the publication of 
Wetzel. For whatever reason I do not know. Thus the question if 
caprellids are venomous still stand unresolved I am afraid. 
Personally I doubt it.

Crustlers,

Does anybody know whether there is a difference in egg number and/or
quality in successive egg batches of crustaceans? We have found that in
the parasitic copepod Lepeophtheirus salmonis the first egg batch is
always smaller than the rest. Any similar observations?

This pretty much confirms my suspicions. I'd forgotten the references (and
mine are all buried in the book-box orogeny that is my library right now),
but the reference to Wetzel sounds like what I was remembering.

The venomous nature of a gland's secretion cannot be determined by
histology or histochemistry. Immunocytochemistry would do the job, if
anyone had antibodies to possible venoms. Otherwise, studies such as
Costa's that Kim referenced need to be done.

"Poison tooth" may have been used if Mayer saw a pore in or at the base of
the spine/spiniform seta on gn2 that sits next to where the distal end of
the terminal segment contacts the penulitmate segment when the former
closes. (I've forgotten the Official Names for the moment. Need more
gingko.)

 Hello, 
	I can report on fecundity from what I know. The Antatctic krill
begins to produce eggs as the autral summer commences around christmas
but the egg production goieson throughtout the summer for five more months or sobut the fecundity decreases. This trend is just the opposite of waht you have seen in yout critter, also a crustacean but your species has a different life
style, being parasitic. Regards,

Regarding toxic (or not ?) caprellids I can offer anecdotal support: 

While sorting dreged material I was stung by an animal 
which turned out to be a small caprellid. The pain I felt in my 
finger was similar to that of a bee-sting and lasted for a few hours.

Now I cannot resist. A few years ago during a literature-search i came
across a 1-page article where somebody reported that he was attacked by
caprellids. Obviously this person had quite a formidable chest-hair, and the
caprellids had taken refuge in his chest-hair while he was taking a swim in
the ocean. when he came back onto the beach, the caprellids became unhappy,
and started to bite this poor person. I kind of remember that he had quite a
painful experience. This must have been such an remarkable event for him
that he thought it would be worthwhile to report this caprellid-attack. as
far as i recall he did not however speculate on venoms, but it sounds that
it would be worthwhile to repeat this experiment. it requires, however, a
formidable chest-hair.....
unfortunately i cannot recall where this was published, and i did at that
time not make a copy of the paper....
looking forward to read more about caprellid-attacks, martin

Subject: CRUST-L: Stinging creatures

Crustlers,

Martin's post on chest-hair clinging caprellids reminded me of an 
experience on the Great Barrier Reef.  My wife and I were swimming along 
the reef crest when we were "surrounded" by a large number of pteropods, 
and extremely small gelatinous creatures (comb and other jellies).  My 
wife's swim suit acted to filter the jellies onto her bosom where she was 
stung repeatedly.  Chest hairs protected me from all of the stings.  We 
both wore sting suits thereafter.

In a similar occurrence, I had a blue bottle (Physalia) tentacle brush 
across my face and was saved from a burn by the fact that I 
hadn't shaved for two days.  Guess there's something to say for being a 
grubby male :-)

Cheers, Jeff

Subject: CRUST-L: Crayfish identification???

I am starting a project on the ecology and distribution of crayfish in the
mountains of West-Central PA.  To my knowledge, next to nothing has been
done here since Ortmann in 1906(5?). (I am converting myself from a marine
to an aquatic ecologist, a wise decision considering my location.)  After
doing some reading and talking informally to people at meetings, I have
come to two conclusions: 

1) It is incredibly difficult to ID crayfish in the field below genus.

2) Forget about IDing females at all.


So, now my questions:

1) Am I being overly pessimistic? (I sure hope so...) Is there a way to ID
below genus in the field and can one ID females, at least to genus?  I am
trying to avoid sacrificing every crayfish we collect just so that we can
ID them. 

2) Does a dichotomous key to crayfish genera exist?  I have Horton-Hobbs
(1989) checklist and some more recent stuff, but haven't found a good key. 
(Though the image of myself and my undergraduate researchers perched next
to a bucket of crayfish while flipping through all those pictures of
reproductive appendages is amusing, it would get pretty old after a couple
of weeks.) 

3) Does anybody know if there is some work in Western PA that I have
missed during my computer searches, like dissertations or unpublished
work?

4) If field ID's are too difficult to do, what do those of you who work on
crayfish do about that?  

Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.  Feel free to
respond privately and I will post a summary later if anybody is
interested.

Dear Crust-lers,

I am looking for references for the gammarid genus Anonyx (fam.
Lysianassidae). A guide to world wide species (if such a thing exists) would
be great. The species I am interested in is the one that resembles A.
lilljeborgi, but has the inner ramus of the second uropod not very
constricted. This species is abundant locally (in Southeast Alaska) and is
something of a pest to crabbers and long-liners because they will strip bait
and even hooked fish. Thanks in advance- Aaron

Subject: Ocypode quadrata

Hello Decapodologists, 	
During the last few weeks we had a recurring little conversation around our
coffee-pot. We were wondering about the reproduction of Ocypode quadrata.
Despite being a very common crab, it appears to be difficult to track down
information on its reproductive seasonality and larval settlement. A friend
of mine who is working on this topic had searched several databases, but
could not find any good leads. We are convinced that there must be
information out there about Ocypode quadrata and its reproductive
seasonality and larval settlement, and we would appreciate any hints. Thank
you very much.
Martin Thiel

Kia ora
I have heard of parasitic crustaceans with soft, unscleratinised cuticles,
which no longer moult but continue to grow in size.  What is the current
understanding of this? Are these crustacea growing (addition of new
cellular material), or does their cuticle simply stretch?
thanks in advance
Penny

Subject: CRUST-L: Caprellid nasties

All this talk of caprellids has reminded me of a young woman who turned up
at the Museum with a caprellid to identify. It seems she had had a rather
severe anaphylactic shock reaction after eating from a tin of smoked
oysters in which this poor little fella had also been accidently entombed.
It was a typical reaction that she has to crustaceans, but I was amazed
that such a tiny little skinny body would cause such a problem.

Dear Penny

I have studied rhizocephalan cirripedia extensively. It is well
understood that they increase the size of the external reproductive =
body
by moults (1,2) However, some species are capable of drastic increases
in size in between moults.
In one species I studied, it seemed as if the small parasite had
"reserves" of epithelium and cuticle infolded as bars which were later
stretched and became true part of the exterior lining as the parasite
increased in size (3)

Finally, the internal root system of rhizocephalan barnacles is covered
by a very delicate cuticle. This root system grows extensively but is
NEVER moulted (4)

Best regards
Jens

Methods in Underwater Ecology

3-7 Aug.  (Arrive/equip. check: Sun. Aug 2)

Dr. Richard Wahle
Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences

>From kelp beds to urchin barrens, the diverse subtidal habitats of the
central Maine coast is the backdrop for a concentrated experience in
underwater ecological research methods at Bigelow Laboratory.  This course
is geared toward upper level undergraduates and beginning graduate students
desiring an overview of time-tested as well as cutting-edge methods of
population, community, and behavioral ecology.  We will discuss methods
used in underwater observation, habitat description, and hypothesis
testing.  Morning briefings and evening discussions will give case studies
to illustrate and critique current methods. For example, we will deal with
how to customize quadrat and transect survey techniques to the demographic
question at hand; the statistical principals behind minimum sample size
determination; measurement of habitat patchiness and structural complexity;
photographic analysis of attached biota; and in situ video analysis of fish
or lobster behavior.  Divers will work in teams to apply these methods
while contributing to an ecological data base of sites in surrounding
waters.

Class size: 8 students for 4 dive teams.
Prerequisites:  Undergraduate courses biology and ecology or permission of
instructor
Certifications: Nationally recognized diver certification, CPR, First Aid
Diver health/injury insurance -  DAN membership - covers hyperbaric injury.

Satellite Imagery as a Resource for Learning
A course for  teachers and students

10-21 August

Cynthia Erickson
Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences

This two-week course provides an introduction to satellite imagery and
image analysis techniques. Participants will explore satellite images and
the software needed to interpret them. This course covers the nature of a
digital image, electromagnetic radiation, spectral bands, reflectance
patterns of land/ocean features and specific training for using the
software provided. Through hands-on applications, students will learn to
interpret multispectral signatures and cluster and classify an image.
Accessory technologies such as GIS and GPS will be introduced. Emphasis is
on the use of satellite imagery as a resource for learning.  Enrollment
limited to 20 students.
**************************************************************************
Flow and Imaging Cytometry for the Aquatic Sciences

21 September - 2 October

Dr. Michael Sieracki
Bigelow Laboratory for Ocean Sciences

Dr. Gunter Valet
Max-Plank Institute for Biochemistry

This course will cover the application of flow and imaging cytometry
techniques for the study of marine microorganisms - including prokaryotes,
protozoa, and phytoplankton.  Basics of flow cytometry and image analysis
will be covered, but emphasis will be on advanced topics such as
imaging-in-flow and the use of functional fluorescent probes for measuring
cytochemical processes and the intracellular physical-chemical state of
living cells.  Participants are encouraged to develop small projects that
can make use of the resources of the Center for Culture of Marine
Phytoplankton and the flow and imaging cytometry instruments here at
Bigelow.
**************************************************************************
Marine Microbial Ecology

5-16 October

Dr. Bess Ward (1997 Hutchinson Medal Winner)
Univ. California Santa Cruz

Focus of this course will be on bacterial transformations in biogeochemical
cycles; including conventional as well as molecular techniques to study
environmental microbiology.  Course includes field work (day cruise) and
analysis of field samples (detection and characterization of bacteria using
DNA-based methods, as well as measurement of in situ activities).  Lectures
will focus on the current literature and topics of current controversy.

Subject: CRUST-L: Mac Worm (fwd)

Crustaceologists,
If you're a Mac user, you may want to check this out.  
Cheers, Jeff

   [ the following article was posted by Gene Spafford <spaf@cs.purdue.edu>
     to inform the Macintosh community about a new "critter", a worm that
     was given the name "Autostart 9805" by the anti-viral software community.
                        ---Werner   (CSMA moderator)
   ]


- -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The Macintosh world has been largely free of new Mac-specific viruses
and their kin over the past few years.  The last real virus to emerge
was in April of 1994, when the INIT-29-B virus appeared.  In 1995, we
saw the Hypercard HC-9507 virus appear, and the first Microsoft Word
macro virus.  Thereafter, except for residual infections of old
viruses, the only worrisome Macintosh-specific malware for almost 3
years have been macro viruses of Microsoft software.  (Contrast this
with as many as ten thousand new viruses for that other PC platform in
the same time period.)

Our respite has ended for the time-being.


              New Macintosh Worm Discovered (Autostart 9805)
                             4 May 1998

Virus: Autostart 9805
Damage: Adds invisible files to every disk partition and periodically
        causes extensive disk activity (and network activity if
        network disks are mounted).  Will overwrite some data files
        with random data.
Spread: PowerPC systems running the MacOS or later
        and with mounted HFS or HFS+ volumes.  Initial infection
        usually requires QuickTime 2.0 or above installed.

====

Autostart-9805 is technically a worm program.  It does not change any
existing program or file to spread itself.  Instead, it copies itself
to other disk partitions so that it becomes active on other systems.

The first reported appearances of this software were in Hong Kong, and
it has spread very rapidly among the desktop publishing (DTP)
community there.

The worm can be transmitted via almost any HFS or HFS+ disk volume,
including floppy disks, most removable cartridges drives, MO disks,
CD-WORM disks, hard disks and even disk images.  The code requires a
PowerPC-based system running MacOS -- a 68K-based system will fail to
run the code.  The worm will also spread across networks to any
mounted network file partition.

Infected disks contain an invisible application file named "DB" (type
'APPL', creator '????', with the "invisible" attribute set) in the
root directory, with autostart set. When the infected disk is mounted
on a PowerPC MacOS system running QuickTime 2.0 or later, the "DB"
application is launched automatically if the AutoStart feature is
enabled in QuickTime.  It then copies itself to the Extensions folder
of the active System. It changes the name of the copy to "Desktop
Print Spooler" and the type to 'appe' (do NOT confuse this file with
the visible and legitimate "Desktop Printer Spooler" extension); the
worm file is also invisible, and when running is not shown in the
applications menu.  It then restarts the computer system.

The worm, in the form of the invisible application in the extension
folder, is automatically launched whenever the computer system starts
up. About every thirty minutes, it examines the mounted volumes. If
any are not already infected, it attempts to infect them by copying
itself to the root directory (renamed back to "DB" and type 'APPL')
and setting up the AutoStart field in the boot block. Most writable
volumes are successfully infected. The notable exception is server
volumes, which do not have the necessary boot block fields for
AutoStart. The worm file is copied to writable server volumes, but it
does not get launched when the volume is mounted.

Note that once the extension version of the worm is in place, turning
off QuickTime makes no difference -- the virus will continue to load
and spread as a result of being activated at system boot time.

Damage

After checking the mounted volumes for infection, the worm begins
searching for certain files on each disk. Files ending with "data",
"cod", and "csa" (case insensitive) are targeted if the data fork is
larger than 100 bytes. Files ending with "dat" are targeted if they are
larger than about 2 Mbytes (resource + data forks). When a targeted file
is found, it is damaged by overwriting the data fork (up to approximately
the first 1 Mbyte) with garbage. The first byte is always set to zero,
and this serves as a flag to bypass the file on subsequent passes.

Symptoms

The worm has numerous symptoms that make it reasonably easy to
identify:

1) The system unexpectedly restarts after mounting a diskette or other
volume. This will only happen when the initial infection occurs.

2) The "DB" application name flashes briefly in the menu bar when a disk
is mounted.

3) The presence of an invisible application file named "DB" on the root
of disk volumes, or the invisible "Desktop Print Spooler" file in the
extensions folder. Any file or disk utility program (such as ResEdit)
that shows invisible files in its file selection dialogs can be used to
check for the files. Be sure not to confuse the legitimate "Desktop
Printer Spooler" file with the worm.

4) A process named "Desktop Print Spooler" is found (use Process Watcher
or Macsbug).

5) Extensive, unexplained disk activity every 30 minutes.

Prevention

The risk of infection can be effectively eliminated by manually disabling
the AutoStart option in the QuickTime Settings Control Panel. This will
not help if the system is already infected.  It will also not prevent
an infected Mac from creating the invisible "DB" files on any
partitions you share with them on a network.

Versions of QuickTime prior to 2.5 do not seem to have a way to
disable autoplay.   You should disable QuickTime or upgrade to a
recent version if you have an old release.

Note: recent versions of QuickTime also have an "Enable Audio CD
AutoPlay" option.  This option can be left on.  Note that disabling
the autostart feature does not have any affect on the normal operation
of QuickTime, and can be safely turned off.

Removal & Recovery

Most of the major anti-virus developers have prepared updates to their
software.  The remaining vendors will undoubtedly have updates soon.
Users are *strongly* encouraged to run current, up-to-date anti-virus
software, and to regularly incorporate vendor-supplied updates.

In the absence of such software, you can remove the virus using the
following steps.  However, you will need to restore damaged data files
from backups (you *do* make regular backups, don't you?).

1) Reboot your system with extensions off.  (Reboot while pressing the
shift key.)

2) Start the Apple "Find File" utility.  Use it to search all volumes
for files whose name is exactly "DB" and which are invisible.  (To
select for visibility, hold down the option key when clicking on the
"Name" pop-up menu; use "more choices" to select both search
criteria.)  Drag found files from the Find window to the trash.

3) Search again, for the "Desktop Print Spooler" file.  Delete it
also.  (Be sure to NOT delete the legitimate "Desktop Printer
Spooler"!!).

4) Empty the trash.

5) Open the "QuickTime Settings" control panel and disable autostart
unless there is some significant reason you need it.

6) Restart.

====
If you discover what you believe to be a virus on your Macintosh
system, please report it to the vendor/author of your anti-virus
software package for analysis.  Such reports make early, informed
warnings like this one possible for the rest of the Mac community.  If
you are otherwise unsure of who to contact, you may send e-mail to
<spaf@cs.purdue.edu> as an initial point of contact.

Also, be aware that writing and releasing computer viruses or worms is
more than a rude and damaging act of vandalism -- it is also a
violation of many state and Federal laws in the US, and illegal in
several other countries.  If you have information concerning the
author of this or any other damaging software, please contact your
anti-virus software vendor or your national law enforcement agency.
Several Mac virus authors have been apprehended thanks to the efforts
of the Mac user community, and some have received criminal convictions
for their actions.  This is yet one more way to help protect your
computers.

I'm looking for a text on crustacean biology that is suitable for 2nd year

crustaceans in general instead of on particular species or genera.
Crustacean Farming by Lee and Wickins looks the most promising but I have
not been able to get my hands on a copy yet.

Penny,
The parasitic entoniscid isopods do not appear to molt.  The 
females grow internally in the hemocoels of their hosts.  I suspect 
that what-you'd-call the cuticle simply stretches.  I haven't done any 
histology on the group to very the presence of chitin in the "cuticle."  

Otherwise, Jens' example of the rhizocephalan rootlets are good examples of 
growth without molting.

Cheers, Jeff

Bill,

        One that immediately comes to mind is volume 3 of Kaestner's
"Invertebrate Zoology," which deals exclusively with Crustacea.  I don't
know whether it is still in print, but it was/is published by Robt. E.
Krieger Publishing Company in Huntington, NY, in 1980.  I suspect that it is
probably what you are looking for, although you'll need to update the
information for your students (Kaestner's cut-off for information for the
book was 1966).  Another excellent possibility is Fred Schram's "Crustacea"
(1986), published by Oxford University Press (with an office in NY).  This
is more up-to-date and detailed than Kaestner's, but it depends on what you
are looking for.  Reviews of Schram's book can be found in J. Crust. Biol.
7(1):200-201, J. Crust. Biol. 7(4):781-782, and American Scientist
75:295-296.  Don't be surprised to be frustrated in your search -- I was
when I looked for a text for my crustacean course many years ago.

Subject: CRUST-L: toxic crusties responses

Folks,

Below are the responses I received to my question about toxic crustaceans,
with authors. There weren't that many replies, so I left them intact. It's
still somewhat lengthy, though.

The upshot seems to be, yes there are toxic crusties, and maybe there are
some venomous ones, but we really don't know much about this.

The apparent lack of many toxic/venomous crustaceans is very interesting,
especially given the ubiquity of defensive toxins and offensive/defensive
venoms in arthropods and inverts generally (and even those abberant things,
"vertebrates").

This suggests first off that we are just missing the poisonous crusties. It
also leads to the speculation that crusties with heavy raptorial appendages
(crabs, lobsters, stomatopods) don't need venom, analogous to uropygids,
amblypygids, and solpugids among arachnids. But they could still use
defensive toxins-ask any octopus.

But even if that is true, what about all the rest of the crusties? Why
aren't any of them venomous? Or toxic, either synthesized or sequestered in
their diet, from toxic organisms? Why don't filter-feeders in particular
have defensive toxins?

I wouldn't include in this question crusties that become toxic from their
diet, but keep the toxin in the hepatopancreas. This would be accidental
accumulation, and then keeping the toxin away from the rest of the crab's
(e.g.) tissues. A defensive toxin that doesn't work until the owner is dead
isn't much use-especially not without warning coloration or behaviors.

There seems to be a serious issue here in need of work. And given the grant
monies available for research into materia medica-and so toxic and venomous
critters-from governments and pharmaceutical companies, maybe people ought
to take an interest in this question?

Regarding toxic (or not ?) caprellids I can offer anecdotal support:

While sorting dreged material I was stung by an animal
which turned out to be a small caprellid. The pain I felt in my
finger was similar to that of a bee-sting and lasted for a few hours.

Edwin Cruz-Rivera ecruzriv@email.unc.edu:
        An interesting question...  Looking at some of the unpublished
examples of chemically defended crustaceans that have been mentioned here
makes you wonder if the lack of reports is because we have not looked hard
enough.  My recollection is that only pea crabs have been claimed to
produce chemical defenses of any sort (this is in JEMBE, but I can't
remember the year nor the authors). A particular mucus film on the
carapace of the crab was argued to serve as defense, and it was only found
on one of the larval stages.  However, this paper lacked the critical
tests that would conclusively demonstrate the presence of a chemical
defense.
        For those larger crabs that have been claimed toxic, the
accumulation of dinoflagellate metabolites is often responsible for the
reports, most of which deal with medical cases (I did not know about
Birgus latro, though).  Whether this has an antipredatory effect in nature
it is unknown.  It certainly would mean death to the crab, since the
toxins accumulate inside the body. Unless there is kin selection, this
would not be much of an effective strategy.  However, if there is
sublethal predation, this may work.  It is not unusual for a crab to lose
a leg or two, and if the predators learn to avoid the animal there may be
a net benefit.  A similar argument has been made by Rikk Kvitek and
coworkers about butter clams which accumulate dinoflagellate toxins, and
which suffer from siphon nipping by natural enemies (Kvitekk and Beitler.
1988. J. Mar. Res. 4:629-636; Kvitekk.  1991.  Mar. Biol.  111:369-374).
I don't know of similar studies conducted on crustaceans.
        As far as "behavioral sequestration", a term often used to
describe cases like Philip Oshel and Alistair Poore mention, in which
defense is by association, there are a few reports.  As Alistair pointed
out, the amphipod Pseudoampithoides incurvaria makes a domicile from a
chemically defended alga (Dictyota bartrayesii)and gets protection from
fish.  Interestingly, Barnard and Karaman (1991) mention that both
Pseudoampithoides species described show the same behavior, but the
chemistry of the interaction has only been studied in the case of P.
incurvaria (Hay et al. 1990).
        McClintock's pteropod abduction by a hyperiid amphipod is similar.
However, only a percentage of the amphipods in that paper had pteropods,
and I have been told that these amphipods will carry on their backs a
number of different things, so the chemical defense could be fortuitous.

[Interjected comment by Oshel: this possibility was tested for by
McClintock and Janssen. The Hyperiids are actively selecting Clione, not
just grabbing anybody that comes along.]

More recently, a friend of mine has demonstrated that the decorator crab,
Libinia dubia, will selectively cover itself with a chemically defended
brown seaweed, and that the chemical compound that deters feeding in fish
is the one that stimulates decoration. That paper is in press in Ecology.
Something similar could be happening with hermit crabs that gain added
defense when their shells are covered by hydroids or with anemones, but
again, the chemistry remains to be studied.
        As Philip Oshel notes, it is interesting to see that
sequestration, which is so common in other arthropods, appears to be so
rare in crustaceans.  I wonder if anyone would care to comment on why that
may be.  Are the anatomical or metabolic adaptations that allow insects to
sequester metabolites, missing from crustaceans?  Intuitively I would say
yes, but I would rather hear it from someone who knows.  I doubt we know
enough about crustacean physiology for some of the more exotic, non
comercially important groups, but we know a fair deal about crustacean
physiology for several of the larger species, as well as insects.  Any
ideas, any takers?

P.J.F. Davie P.Davie@mailbox.uq.edu.au:
In the review that Neil Bruce referred to we recorded 22 species of crabs
in 5 families that had toxins in the flesh. Most are Xanthidae, but
Portunidae, Grapsidae, Majidae, and Parthenopidae were also represented.
Toxins identified include Saxitoxin, Paralytic Shellfish Poisons,
Tetrodotoxin, and Palytoxin.

Our belief is that all these types of toxin are taken in via the food
chain - some seem to be reliably poisonous (such as at least some Demania
species), while for most, toxicity varies according to place and probably
season. In general we felt that most small coral reef crabs should be
treated with suspicion.  Grazers are presumably going to be the most
likely to pick up toxins, but predators such as Thalamita (Portunidae)
also had toxins, so in some cases amplification may occur.

I haven't looked at the literature for a while but it seems there are no
records of this phenomenon outside the Indo-West Pacific. With so many
toxins involved, one would expect this process to be happening on
Carribean reefs as well. Has anyone ever looked I wonder?

Actually, there's pretty good circumstantial evidence of this. I don't
know if Birgus are eating to avoid predation, but on islands where this
family of plants is common, natives will tie up Birgus or put them in a
drum for several days to cleanse their systems.

There is also a paper testing the toxicity of Birgus tissue fractions to
mice, and the hepatopancreas of these crabs was quite poisonous. It wasn't
clear which plant was involved.

I looked into this literature to prepare a (unfunded) proposal examining
the effect of rat poison or Birgus. I recall there was a Holthuis paper on
toxic crustaceans too. I'll dig up the bibiography and post it.

Rats often eat young crabs, and older crabs often eat rats. It seems that
the plant alkaloids involved did not affect the crab much, but can have an
effect on vertebrates.

Gregory Jensen <gjensen@FISH.WASHINGTON.EDU>:
        There are at least two species of amphipods in the Pacific
Northwest that appear to utilize chemical defenses.  Both are very boldly
marked, sit right out in the open, and are rejected when offered to
fish.  When stressed they release a brownish liquid from the mouth, much
like the "spit" from grasshoppers (which contains toxins sequestered from
plants).  A fish ecologist, Steve Norton, has done quite a bit of work on
these amphipods but I don't know of any published information yet.

Gustav Paulay <gpaulay@uog9.uog.edu>:
For whatever it is worth, on the island of Mauke (Cook Islands), the spiny
lobster Panulirus penicillatus is regarded as toxic by the locals on some
parts of the reef, but not elsewhere.

Alistair G. B. Poore a.poore@unsw.edu.au:
Among the herbivorous amphipods, many of which do consume algae rich in
secondary metabolites, there are, to my knowledge, no published examples of
chemical sequestration like that found in terrestrial insects or other marine
herbivores such as sea hares. Neither have I heard of any examples of
equestration from other chemically rich hosts such as sponges, soft corals
or bryozoans.

There is one system analogous to McClintock's in which an ampithoid
(Pseudamphithoides incurvaria) carries around a small house made of an alga
(Dictyota) unpalatable to fish. See Hay et al (1990) Host-plant specialization
decreases predation on a marine amphipod: an herbivore in plant's clothing.

Bruce Felgenhaur (sp?) presented the poster at TCS meeting.  I think
there is good circumstantial evidence that the remipedes have a toxin
producing mandibular (?) organ.  Don't know if the paper's been published
yet.
I think the poisonous crabs from the South Pacific obtain their toxin from
eating algae, cf. ciguatera.

Phil, check out the papers by Mark Hay and his students....
there are some nice examples of amphipods using secondary toxins...
best wishes, martin

phil, i forgot. did somebody during the toxic-crust discussion mention the
studies by TOMASCHKO on Pycnogonum littorale? if not, let me know and i'll
dig out the references.
greetings, martin

ok, phil, here is probably the most easily accessible reference about these
pycnogonids:
Tomaschko, K.-H., 1994. Ecdysteroids from Pycgnogonum litorale (Arthropoda,
Pantopoda) act as chemical defense against Carcinus maenas (Crustacea,
Decapoda). J. chem. Ecol. 20: 1445-1455.
martin

 Phil: Crabs of the genus Pelia seem to prefer sponges of certain
species, but I never was able to identify them or have them identified.
(Jerry Backus always is overloaded with work).  Of the other decorators,
they use just about any sponge of any taxon that is readily available.
They don't seem able to scrape encrusting sponges off rocks, but any
sponge that has vertical relief is fine with them.  I have a Libinia and
a Macrocoeloma in my aquarium right now that are busily redistributing a
Haliclona sponge.  Crabs of the family Dromiidae seem to prefer whatever
sponge is the most common in their habitat, too. There are hermit crabs
that live in sponges that overgrow their shells and form a covering for
the crab. I've never seen any evidence of selection for toxicity,
although it surely is an additional benefit of decorating or carrying a
sponge.

WICKSTEN@bio.tamu.edu:
The work on toxic crabs appeared in systematic work on crabs of the
family Xanthidae (John Garth's work) and in the journal Toxicon, a
toxicological journal not on the usual reading list of crustacean
biologist.  Mary Wicksten

MOI FELLOW CRUST-LISTERS,
I am wrestling with western rock lobster hemocytes, mainly trying to figure
out the changes in circulating hemocytes induced by various treatments, i.e.
stressors. One of the questions I have to address is the change in hemolymph
volume as it affects the numbers of the circulating hemocytes. The
literature gives very confusing advice on methods that can be used to
measure hemolymph volume. I wonder if anyone out there has useful
suggestions on precise and idiotproof methods (=simple and easy) to measure
the hemolymph volume in western rock lobsters. Thanks in advance and my best
craywishes

It was a marketing effort to get little kids (like myself, then) to want to
buy the cysts ("eggs") and hatch those "cute" little critters that behaved
like little monkeys in a jar of water. I can picture the adds in the '60s
and perhaps as far back as the '50s (?)

Craig,

I've used fiberglass resin on Uca burrows with some success.  The trick 
is to add less hardener and to let it cure overnight before digging.  And 
yes, you have to dig, that's par for the course.  John Christy uses 
paraffin with success but I think the burrows have to above the water level 
for this to work well.

I need to dye slices of Nephrops appendages (telsons) in order to look at
the formation of the carapace (Nephrops = small red lobster related with
Homarus) . The objective is to define the intermolt stages based on the
development of the carapace. The pieces are mounted in historesin. Can
anyone give advice on the best dye to use? Tank you all,
Margarida

Subject: CRUST-L: aquaculture and the web

Aquaculture, the aquatic living World Wide Web, the pathology logical 
				... 	and solutions
					
A recent report about Biodiversity mentioned that  in fresh water and
marine communities, information is currently completely absent . Any
aquaculture experience is a valuable source of information to help
understand the microflora web evolution, normal and pathological :
synthetic view is not easy. Biodiversity is a balance, stable or
unstable, up to the time frame, in agreement with local environment -
mineral and climate - , thus local biochemistry. 
	
Is modern marine aquaculture a sustainable activity ? Or does it affect
the environment and destroy it ? 
To aquacultivate or not to aquacultivate ? That is the question ! 
Answers and solutions lie in a better understanding and true practical
control of the interaction between culture and the microflora World Wide
Web. The aquatic microflora is also a  natural  World Wild Web,
capable of developing true  clean  bacterial wars to reduce  any
organic load , dead or still alive, back to where it started from : the
mineral world in a clean water environment accepting more biodiversity.
It is not a science fiction film !

Shrimp culture, from easy time to disease

Marine shrimp aquaculture production have grown rapidly and is still
producing over 700.000 T all over the world and representing an
impressive source of wealth in areas that have little alternative to
offer. Since 1988, some national productions have dropped significantly,
because of  disease . 
In 1998, disease is still considered as a major threat by most of the
actors, producers, bankers, politicians and ecologists that claim that
land has been destroyed for no purpose. Be reinsured, ecologist friends,
there is nothing easier to clean than a shrimp pond : anywhere in the
world, any shrimp pond can be rehabilitated, put back in operation and
profit, at low cost (if it was correctly conceived) . Disease can be
prevented and production doubled, being at the same time, ecologically
correct ! Disease are youth errors due to poor technology and ignorance
and as it is often the case in R'n'D, to study pathological situation
helps to understand how a healthy balanced situation works and how to
maintain it. 
A complete book will be probably necessary to describe and explain the
biochemical pathways that lead from health to pathology. Health and
pathology use the same biochemical laws and pathogenicity is a normal
fate for an efficient germ : disease signs the success of the microflora
wild web in digesting organic overload and the failure of culturist
technology in controlling the life of his ponds !

Aquaculture technology and the microflora Web

The early shrimp farming years were a gold rush. Imre Csavas, FAO
Regional Aquaculture Officer in Asia, observed in 1994, that  the
largely empirical nature of shrimp culture development . World
aquaculture 1994 , 25(1), p.36.
Shrimp grows well, without much care in various environmental conditions
; it demonstrates they are very hardy animals and dollars can be
harvested every 3 to 5 months. No difficult technology is required : if
the neighbour can do it, anybody can do it. 
Everywhere around the world, the easy early years face difficult follow
up due to similar situations, because of  disease , that sound as
excuse !  
 A little learning is a dangerous thing  said the poet A. Pope. But
disease is not middle age plague any more. Disease germ obeys to the
same biochemical and biological laws that rule the shrimp environment.
Through those laws, it is always possible to read what is occurring in a
pond.
There is a biological and biochemical logic in disease apparition and
dis-apparition. Dis-ease in industrial husbandry is mainly due to
opportunistic agents and build up, from the local microflora web. To
monitor it is a precious tool to understand better, normal and
pathological situation and how to shift it back to normal.
True scientific and industrial solution of culture farming technology
should include preventive measure against crowding disease  to be
complete. 

Shrimp aquaculture : a know how or a true technology ? 

What is an artisan extensive culture technology ? 
Basically, it consists in destroying predators, seeding with juveniles
and in avoiding oxygen depletion through some water management. It is a
true  know how  based on local personal experience and need little
monitoring. To manage extensively an aquaculture pond is more an art
than a technology, lacking of theoretical concept. Historically,
agriculture operated in similar ways during centuries !

But it is very difficult to help an artist : he has an holistic view of
his art and he does not need to monitor any parameters to produce.
Co-operation between scientific and artist is difficult. Only industrial
orientated producers will be able to inject better technology and to
improve production.

For a more industrial approach, as in the computer business, aquaculture
technology requires hardware and software. Hardware is the engineering
part and software should be specifically adapted to it and to the
location. To copy a program without true understanding of scientific
back ground, from a different place leads sometime to disappointing
results. The software is made of a main program and subprograms
representing specific procedures ; controls subprograms ensure that the
operation is managed in a correct way. 

Pathology can be considered as an unwritten subprogram that takes the
lead on the main program, mainly because of lack of real control of the
environment. Vaccination is, in fish and higher vertebrate, an efficient
sub program in culture technology, a way to avoid the impact of outside
bugs. But in shrimp culture, vaccination is not possible and bug has its
own life, it reproduces and often destroys host tissue. 

So the answer to pathology in aquaculture is to reprogram technology
from day one, in order to  control  the normal microflora web. It
represents clearly more complete understanding of various biochemical
process and procedure than any extensive practice and it can be applied
to many  ecological  situations, in open or closed ecosystem.
Economical solutions are available today and can be adapted to any
situations.

The aquatic living World Wide Web : logical efficiency leading to
pathogenicity

The understanding of the disease evolution process supposes to recognise
that in the aquatic world, germ life is a continuous challenge in
adapting to new environment conditions. Any standing position is
provisional : life is only a long chain of dis-balance links. Without
inclining towards anthropocentrism, - nor any social comparison - the
normal fate of any opportunistic germ is to become pathogen when
condition allows it. 

Additional organic load in an aquatic ecosystem induces an immediate
microbial response to digest it and to treat the waste. Biochemical load
induces biological response from the microbial web. Thank to such
efficiency, evolution and biodiversity have been made possible. But any
dis-balance may induce dis-ease in some hosts, as normal part of
evolution.

Technology consists in being economically more efficient. Today disease
situation in most of extensive shellfish culture are due to secondary
invaders that have turn pathogen - bacteria, virus and anything in
between - because of limited management procedures. In other words,
disease of the shellfish are due to some pathology of management and/or
ageing environment, which is the consequence of poor technology and
management.

It is not a chaotic world : biochemical laws may lead to pathology more
often than to healthy products ! It is the evolution operating under our
eyes, augmenting or reducing biodiversity ! As in any system, it is the
dosage that makes the therapeutic or the poison : little pollution may
be beneficial.

Extensive aquaculture is similar to extensive agriculture. It is an Art
which has its limit : pathology is one of them. And scientists are not
professional artist. Books could be written  - and probably will by some
Internet participants - on culture technology, programming and disease
prevention, but all the information is already available in various
books covering exotic university knowledge such as water and soil
physic, chemistry, biochemistry, bacteriology, immunology, and more
specific sectors as engineering, industrial crowding disease, etc... The
way to theoretical interpretation is a  long and winding road  but, as
in many biotechnology, practical procedures are reliable and economical
in a given program. 

Conclusion

It was a shock to a lot of  scientific aquaculturists  that marine
modern Aquaculture can be a threat to the environment and, as ecologist
born, that they were on the wrong side : not at all ! 

Aquaculturists scientists are climbing on the shoulders on many
colleagues from various origin from  true fundamental scientific world
, in order to understand and better manage any ecosystem, natural,
extensive or more intensive. To put such knowledge in practice is a
different political story ! Nature has his way. Not to choose not to do
anything IS a selected political choice with unknown consequences. NOT
to do is  the temptation to remain innocent   - from a French
political essay by P. Bruckner. It has social, ecological, thus
political implication sometime deeper than action !

Microbial activity is regular biochemical answers to daily environmental
fluctuations ; pathology is part of normal life of the aquatic World
Wide Web, eventually  turning Wild  facing high organic load. In
aquatic ecosystem, Health, Sustainability and Biodiversity are temporary
balances, with faster turn over than out in the air. And trying to
stabilise this fluctuating environment is probably a good reason to walk
out of the water !

To cultivate or not to cultivate ? Is that still the question ?
In an aquatic site, Nature has developed its  controls  to reach some
level of productivity and biodiversity and technology pretends to do
better, in a limited time frame, but may leave some  costly  residues
behind. So the only immediate answer is : when the site can be
disinfected, any culture is possible, whether in open water or in a
closed system; if not, Nature have to take care of the left over, at its
own speed, and it may include dis-ease pathways !

Is shrimp farming sustainable ? The easy obvious answer is : of course !
Very extensive farming will remain an art, managed by artist, receiving
little from scientists. But it is not dangerous for the environment ! It
does not need any pH meter.
Semi intensive farming will act as any responsible industrial producer
and will be ecologically correct : there is nothing easier to clean that
water and technology is available ! 

2000's fish and shellfish farming has already started to produce and is
a complete closed system. This is not in order to please romantic
ecologists but simply because it is safer and cheaper - the only key
word that counts ! Cheaper because of higher survival, better growth
rate, and soon permitting genetic selection.

Dear Craig,

I just remember that the article below also deals with burrows of 
crabs (Thalassinidea); I just have the title in my database and could 
not look it up, but I think they also used expanding foam (?) in 
order to get the shape and 3-D-reconstruction of the burrows. 
Hope this is of interest:

I seem to recall some work done in the past with molten lead. 
However, you still have to dig.

Would a camera on the end of optical fibres have some potential?

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: BURROWS -Reply

Crusties:

Cavities between well pipes and surrounding soil are filled with a thin
cement grout.  No sand or gravel added.   Portland cement type II was
normally used here.  It was sometimes poured from the top and displaced
water, but the preferred method was to pump through a pipe that was
withdrawn as grout level rose.  When surface soil was removed to
access the pipe, the grout had a nice impression of the soil. 

Has anyone tried a thin cement grout for burrows casting?

I've used expanding foam and had best luck using a tube extending into
the cavity.

CRUSTLers,
I have put the archives of CRUST-L posts on the web.  If you wish to see
them, go to

http://www.vims.edu/~jeff/archive.htm

They're currently organized by month, but I'm open to organizing them by
year if you think it'll be easier to search for keywords.  Let me know
if
you use them.

Re anaesthetics: this topic, and the one on anti-coagulants come up
enough
that they would make a good web page.  Any takers?

Hi People,
Sorry to once again revive the ghost of anaesthetic thread past but I'm hoping
someone out there can help us. This Summer we are hoping to sample some of
the crevice dwelling decapods which exist subtidally along the west coast of
Ireland. Some of the crevices can be 2-3 metres deep making it difficult to
reach the animals. One idea we are working with involves shooting some kind of
anaesthetic into the crevice and then removing the fauna with a diver operated
suction sampler. My questions are 1) Has anybody sampled similar type habitat
and if so, what method would you recommend? 2) What anaesthetic could be
suitable? I have consulted the crust-L archives with MS-222 and MgCl2 being the
most frequently used. Would these be suitable for divers working at depths of
approx. 10 metres?

Thanking you for your time,

I don't believe that MS-222 or MgCl2 will do the job in the field. I
suggest trying Eugenol (Clove Oil) or Quinoline (Quinaldine). I've used
both in crevices and they work well. Q-juice is kind of nasty, however. My
experience with MS-222 is that not all crusties are affected by it.

Check on the legality of the usage of any chemical you are using in your
area.

Subject: CRUST-L: one-eyed crusties

I haven't seen any other responses to the original question about Cyclops
and the number of eyes, so I'll stick my toe back in and respond to Jens
Hoeg's comment on my thought:

Size. They're too small to have more than one eye. Jens countered with
informed comments on the eyeness of Cyclops, disputing my idea.

I should have stated in the first place that I was thinking of Cladocerans.
With that in mind, I still think it's mostly a space problem. The critters
don't have room for more than one (compound) eye, and don't need more than
one anyway.
Polyphemus certainly terrorizes the zooplankton with its monocular view of
the world.

Dear Crusters,

we are currently working on an exhibition and a book about freshwater
crayfish in Austria. Autochtonous species are severely threatened by 
american species infected with Aphanomyces (which is nothing new to 
this group, I guess ;-)

I am urgently looking for an international expert on Aphanomyces astaci 
who is willing to contribute an article about this topic. The book will 
appear in German but with english abstracts. (An english article will be 
translated)

If you are or if you know "the" expert on Aphanomyces astaci, please 
contact me ASAP! e-mail: eeder@zoo.univie.ac.at

thank you for your attention and best craywishes, Erich

Hello crustlers,
I strongly join the invitation of Jeff.
Once I had a thread on anesthetics saved in my PC, but I lose it! :-(
I have searched the online crust-l archive, but I could not find all the
postings related (I remember they were about 10 or so).
Is there a good-willing person out there who has saved the postings and
will kindly make a FAQ or something similar?

Cheers,
Carlo Pipitone

MS222 is fairly ineffective on most crustaceans, especially brachyurans,
although it has been recommended for amphipods (Ahmad, 1969. Anaesthetic
effects of ms222 on Gammarus pulex. Crustaceana, 16: 197-201.). I'd
recommend a clove oil bath for your application, at 0.125 ppt.  As with
most situations, it's best to add a little ethanol to get things mixing.

I don't have any experiences with MS 222, but for my doctoral thesis
I used 7% MgCl2 (in aqua dest ) successfully to anesthetize decapod larvae
before
 fixation. MgCl2 works also for most other planktonic organisms. Good luck,

I am using MS 222 for years to immobilize freshwater Amphipods and it
works very well. I use concentrations of 1,5 g/l and the Gammarids
need about 5 min to fell asleep (at 20 degrees C).
There's a paper about Gammarus pulex and MS 222:

From: Roy Caldwell <4roy@socrates.Berkeley.Edu>
Subject: CRUST-L: Anaesthetic for Crustaceans

Dear Crusters:
>From time to time I see requests for a good method to anaesthetize
crustaceans come across this list.  Most of us have found that there are
problems with MS-222, Quinaldine, etc.  The usual answer that is given is
"cold".  Cold does indeed work well for many crustaceans, but for the
tropical stomatopods which I study, it kills them.  Over the years I have
tried just about every compound I could think of and nothing worked.  If
they stopped moving, they didn't wake up and if they did, the raptorial
appendages were no longer functional (the raptorial appendages have a
special metabolic pathway, but that is another story).  The only thing that
even came close to being reversible was a 1% mixture of ether in sea water
and that was very difficult to use.
Well, I finely found an anaesthetic that works, is safe, cheap, and allows
me to keep stomatopods under for several minutes.  People in Australia have
been using eugenol to knock out fish and we tried it on stomatopods.  It
works like a charm.  To formulate it, we add 5 ml of 95% ETOH to 1 liter of
sea water, then add 5 drops of eugenol.  This concentration will knock out
a stomatopod in a couple of minutes and if you then rinse them off with sea
water, they will stay under for a few minutes with no adverse effects.  To
keep stomatopods under longer, we transfer them to a 25% dilution of the
stock solution.  I haven't tried this for longer than about half an hour,
but for at least that period, it is still reversible.
I have not tried this with other crustaceans, but given how sensitive
stomatopods are to just about any drug we tried, I suspect it will work -
but please don't try it one your most valuable beast without a little
testing first.
Oh, and if you are wondering what eugenol is, it is the main ingredient in
Clove Oil.  Clove oil is usually about 80-90 eugenol.  What ever else is in
it, does not seem to bother stomatopods, although I have now started using
the pure stuff.  Roy Caldwell

Subject: CRUST-L: IFS- Call for Research Grant Applications

THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE - CALL
FOR RESEARCH GRANT APPLICATIONS FROM DEVELOPING
COUNTRY SCIENTISTS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF AQUATIC RESOURCES
The International Foundation for Science (IFS) provides support to
young scientists of merit in developing countries by awarding
research grants and providing grantees with additional services such
as travel grants and purchasing assistance.
Within the scope of Aquatic Resources, projects can relate to research
dealing with the ecology and sustainable management of aquatic
resources. Simple surveys should not be included. Project proposals
dealing with aquaculture research, ie site selection, selection,
breeding, rearing, and nutrition of cultivable organisms, and disease
control are invited. Relevant research in fisheries, aquatic biology and
ecology, environmental impact including coastal zone management,
and ecology of species and ecosystems can be proposed in
applications.
Research grants are awarded up to a maximum value of USD 12,000
for a period of one to three years and may be renewed twice. They are
intended for the purchase of equipment, expendable supplies, and
literature. Applicants must be citizens of, and carry out the research
in, a developing country. They should also be employed at a
university or national research institution in a developing country. As
well as being under the age of 40 (under 30 for applicants from
China) and at the start of their research career, candidates must
possess a higher academic degree, which should be at least an MSc or
equivalent.
The IFS supports projects dealing with the management, use, and
conservation of biological resources and their environment. The
Foundation organizes its activities into six Research Areas, viz
Animal Production, Aquatic Resources, Crop Science, Food Science,
Forestry/Agroforestry, and Natural Products.

Subject: CRUST-L: cave amphipods

Hello CRUST-Lers,

recently I asked for cave mysids, and now it is the cave amphipods I 
am interested in. I would like to know to what extent the 
characters I found in cave mysids are due to the "cave-living" 
(compared to amphipod characters). The only problem is to get these 
critters - if you have no money to travel :-( 
Therefore just my simple request: Is there anybody out there 
who has a cave amphipod for me?
Genera Niphargus, Hyalella, Bogidiella, Hadzia, Metaniphargus or 
other cave amphipods? 
May be it is nearly imprudent to ask for such rare material, but it 
is not just for fun or for the completion of a collection, but for 
working.

Best regards and greetings to all of you

Wulf

Subject: CRUST-L: cave amphipods

Hello CRUST-Lers,

recently I asked for cave mysids, and now it is the cave amphipods I 
am interested in. I would like to know to what extent the 
characters I found in cave mysids are due to the "cave-living" 
(compared to amphipod characters). The only problem is to get these 
critters - if you have no money to travel :-( 
Therefore just my simple request: Is there anybody out there 
who has a cave amphipod for me?
Genera Niphargus, Hyalella, Bogidiella, Hadzia, Metaniphargus or 
other cave amphipods? 
May be it is nearly imprudent to ask for such rare material, but it 
is not just for fun or for the completion of a collection, but for 
working.

Best regards and greetings to all of you

Wulf

Subject: CRUST-L: IFS- Call for Research Grant Applications

THE INTERNATIONAL FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE - CALL
FOR RESEARCH GRANT APPLICATIONS FROM DEVELOPING
COUNTRY SCIENTISTS WORKING IN THE FIELD OF AQUATIC RESOURCES
The International Foundation for Science (IFS) provides support to
young scientists of merit in developing countries by awarding
research grants and providing grantees with additional services such
as travel grants and purchasing assistance.
Within the scope of Aquatic Resources, projects can relate to research
dealing with the ecology and sustainable management of aquatic
resources. Simple surveys should not be included. Project proposals
dealing with aquaculture research, ie site selection, selection,
breeding, rearing, and nutrition of cultivable organisms, and disease
control are invited. Relevant research in fisheries, aquatic biology and
ecology, environmental impact including coastal zone management,
and ecology of species and ecosystems can be proposed in
applications.
Research grants are awarded up to a maximum value of USD 12,000
for a period of one to three years and may be renewed twice. They are
intended for the purchase of equipment, expendable supplies, and
literature. Applicants must be citizens of, and carry out the research
in, a developing country. They should also be employed at a
university or national research institution in a developing country. As
well as being under the age of 40 (under 30 for applicants from
China) and at the start of their research career, candidates must
possess a higher academic degree, which should be at least an MSc or
equivalent.
The IFS supports projects dealing with the management, use, and
conservation of biological resources and their environment. The
Foundation organizes its activities into six Research Areas, viz
Animal Production, Aquatic Resources, Crop Science, Food Science,
Forestry/Agroforestry, and Natural Products.

Hello,
I am the student ot Vilnius University in Lithuania. I have started my Bachelor
theses on Malacostraca glacial relict crustaceans (Mysis relicta, Pallasiola
quadrispinosa, Pontoporeia affinis).
 Maybe somebody knows of more methods of collecting these crustaceans.
Ussually, I use benthic trawl or vertical nets (which is not very effective).
I know, that some traps could also be usefull. How large should they be?
Thank you

Dear Mr. or Madam

I would like to inform you of two new ICES papers about the use of the 
Icelandic Data Storage Tags (DST) on fish. These papers are now available 
on our home page, http://www.star-oddi.com

These papers were both introduced on the last ICES meeting in Bolton, but 
here they are available on the net, with figures and tables. There is a 
link direct from the main page to the papers, or they can be found under 
the page "References".

These papers are:
1.	Sturlaugssosn, J. and Thorisson, K. 1997.  Migratory pattern of homing 
Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in coastal waters W-Iceland, recorded by 
data storage tags. ICES, C.M. 1997/CC: 09. 23 p

2.	Godo, O.R. and Michalsen, K. 1997. THE USE OF DATA STORAGE TAGS TO STUDY 
COD NATURAL BEHAVIOUR AND AVAILABILITY TO ABUNDANCE SURVEYS IN THE BARENTS 
SEA. ICES C.M. 1997/W:18 P

These papers are both excellent piece of work and show very well the usage 
of the DST's. Applications like these are the best recommendation for our 
tags, and that these scientists have selected the tags from Star Oddi.

The MRI in Iceland is conducting a DST tagging experiment on plaice 
(Pleuronectes platessa) on the West Coast of Iceland. This is the first 
time our tags have been used on flatfish. The scientists have been getting 
tags from these fish the last weeks and are starting to analyse the data. 
The results look very promising and will be announced on our home page 
later this summer. We will send you mail when the results are ready.

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: zeolites and shrimp

Claude Boyd wrote a review on the use of water and soil amendments in
shrimp ponds and it includes a discussion on Zeolites:

Boyd, C. 1995. Chemistry and efficacy of amendments used to treat wat=
er and
soil quality imbalances in shrimp ponds. In: Browdy, C.L. and Hopkins=

According to the article it would take 95,776 kg of zeolite to remove=
 1 mg
of ammonia per l from a 10,000 m3 shrimp pond with 8 ppt salinity.  B=
oyd
concludes that zeolite treatment for ammonia removal in brackish wate=
r does
not appear very promising. There are claims that zeolite removes hydr=
ogen
sulfide, and carbon dioxide by absorption but zeolite does not effect=
ivly
adsorb gasses in water.  There are also claims that the silica in zeo=
lite
promotes diatom growth but silicon in zeolite is not water soluble an=
d
therefore it is unavailable to diatoms.

 INSTALLATION PROFILE

 The facility offered by The Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN)
combines both the recent and fossil collections with a series of analytical
facilities which constitutes an up-to date tool  for  systematics and
related research in biodiversity in its recent and historical extensions.

 The MNHM houses the national collection of over 100 million natural
history specimens (including more than 600.000 type Specimens), extensive
supporting specialized libraries of over 1,5 million volumes, and the most
important concentration of taxonomic and systematic expertise in France.

 The collections-based research is supported by state-of-the-art specimen
preparation and study facilities.It includes analysis and imaging
instrumentation with electron microscopy and a molecular biology service,
offering the adequate technology to facilitate phylogenetic research.


 POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS

 The MNHMps 15 collections include both preserved and living organisms.
They cover all the scope of plant and animal groups.
This extensive coverage both in space and time (the collection , founded in
the 17th century, still houses a high number of historical specimens)
allows a wide range of researches, covering all aspects of biodiversity
and systematic issues, from environmental global change to every aspect of
taxonomy, evolutionary biology and ecology, in terrestrial as well as
marine environments. The molecular biology service and the unique
collection of cryopreserved cells allow specific approaches to these
scientific investigations.

ACCESS

When accepted by the selection committee for a specific research project,
Users will be integrated into the MNHM functional structure. It is meant
through a multi-disciplinary approach to improve the collections
information content toward their applied use, adding value to the research
output.

Some of the  non restrictive major themes that can be developed around the
Biological collections in cooperation with  the Museum's research teams are
the followings:

- - Ecological Patterns and Processes
It involves an investigation on the distribution of organisms in space and
through time, and the processes by which these patterns are generated. The
conservation and management of biological diversity depends on such a sound
scientific basis. Domains of research range from the ecology of individual
groups to large-scale approach of ecosystems such as tropical forests or
the deep sea.

- - Biodiversity variation in the Plio-pleistocene, involving climatic
variations, fossil faunas and floras, palynology.

- - Faunas and Floras
These researches lead through description and naming to decipher the
diversity of animals and plants and document their variations of different
habitats. It leads to identification keys, regional or more extensive
studies for use in fundamental or applied sciences and conservation
studies.

 - Systematics and Evolution
Through use of both traditional and contemporary techniques, the aim is to
discover and investigate the patterns of biodiversity and evolution. It
constitutes the foundation of all comparative biology and its applications
in such domains as e.g.biogeography, host-parasite relationships. It
involves all kinds of organisms from unicellular ones to highly complex
metazoans.

Dear Jeff

Having removed myself from the crustlers list, I now have a question 
 but also, someone has recommended I contact you (Loren Cohen) for some 
 information so perhaps if you can help I need not join the list again.

You may already know that the BBC Natural History Unit is making a new 
 series about the world's oceans, 'The Blue Planet', an 8 X 50 minute 
 programme series due for transmission in late 2001.  I an trying to 
 fond information about the Chinese Mitten Crab - the one that uses 
 anemones as 'boxing gloves'.  Do you know of anyone who is studying 
 them.  I am not sure where we can go to film them but ideally a tank 
 shoot would be best and so if there is anyone researching them, that 
 would be ideal.

Any information you can offer or more names to follow up would be 
 gratefully received.  My email address is:	jo.ruxton@bbc.co.uk

Many thanks
Jo Ruxton

Subject: CRUST-L: Histamine in crustaceans

List members, 

Does anybody know of any work done on histidine and/or histamine in 
crustaceans?  Especially, crustaceans fed diet rich in histidine 
and/or histamine.  Could it be possible that a lobster, or a crab,
ingesting high levels of histamine develop a pseudo allergic reaction 
(without, of course, the presence of IG's), or some sort of a food 
poisoning?

I would appreciate any info or suggestions.
Thanks,

Jean

List members,

My colleagues and I have begun the long process of testing morphology-
based clawed lobster phylogenies (e.g. Tshudy and Babcock, 1997, 
Journal of Crustacean Biology 17(2):253-263) with molecular data.
We need muscle samples, shipped in alcohol or on dry ice, from all
recent genera.  We have begun sequencing Homarus and Metanephrops but
need samples from all other genera.  We can pay for postage, packing,
etc.

If anyone out there could help, I'll FAX or e-mail more info.
Any replies will be greatly appreciated!

Subject: CRUST-L: Chinese Hairy Crab

Dear List Members,

Lately there has been considerable interest in the commercial
culture of the Chinese Hairy Crab (Eriocheir sinensis) in Malaysia
based on imported seed.

Such importation is currently banned as we are concerned about the
inevitable escape of the crab and its   possible adverse effects.

There seems to quite some reports on the crab establishing 
self sustaining and thriving population in temperate regions outside China.

However we could not find much  information for  tropical conditions.

We are particularly keen to know whether the crab could breed on their 
own in the tropics.

Any assistance would be much appreciated.

Thanks.

TO : Jo Ruxton (jo.ruxton@bbc.co.uk), BBC Natural History Unit
& copy to Crust-L

Here is some information relevant to your question << about the Chinese
Mitten Crab - the one that uses anemones as 'boxing gloves'>>

I think it is not the so-called Chinese Mitten Crab (= Eriocheir sinensis)
but a tropical (Indo-Pacific) charming tiny crab whose latin name is Lybia
tessellata. It may be found among coral reefs.

Here in Paris, the specialist who knows very well Indo-Pacific crabs (and
other crabs too!) is Mme Daniele GUINOT (e-mail guinot@mnhn.fr). She might
help you. Most probably we have stuffed specimens in our collections, but
no living ones.

There is also a coloured post card of Lybia tessellata edited in Firenze
(Italia). The  specimen was from Somalia and the photographer is :

If you want to have a film of this crab, I am afraid that you have to
flight to a tropical area with an aquarium.

By the way, would BBC be interested in presenting films on Crustacea at the
4th ICC (International Crustacean Congress) in Amsterdam, 20-24 July, 1998
? or at the 7th CCDM in Lisboa 6-9 sept. 1999 ?

Dear crusters:
Some time ago there was some discussion on the use of anaesthesics on
crayfish. Recently, I received notice of a method for "sleeping"
crayfish from a Spanish fisherman. You scratch quickly for a minute or
two with your nail in the joint between cephalotorax and abdomen. The
crayfish gets torpid. I tried it yesterday with three species
(Austropotamobius pallipes, Procambarus clarkii and Pacifastacus
leniusculus), and it worked!!! (P. clarkii individuals weighted near 50
g.). Sounds little scientific?. I'd like to know if aanybody in the list
can suggest an explanation for this, or if has heard about something
similar in their countries. I haven=B4t tried this method for field
manipulation of crayfish, but I can recommend it for photographic
purposes on live individuals (try to do it with the animal in the
position in which you are going to take the photographs).

Subject: CRUST-L: Crustacean tracks

My name is Eleonore BISSON. I am looking for information about Crustacean
traces (tracks), within the framework of a memoir of 4th year University,
under the supervision of Pierre Noel, such as :

- - Burrows (Thalassinids : "gebbies", Ghost-crabs, Snapping-shrimps,
Stomatopods, Amphipods ...)
- - Tracks of moving (lobsters, crabs and other large Crustaceans on
sediments, Phyllopods on mud ...)
- - Remains of predation (lobsters, crabs on bivalve shells, or Gastropods...)
- - "Scars" of parasites on their hosts (Sacculina on crabs, Anilocra or
see-lice on fish, Coronula on whales ...)


It seems that published information about that is scarce. Discussions with
different resarchers let me think that direct observations are not so rare.

I would be interested with contacting people knowing something about this
subject (personal observations, publications), so that we could have
discussions and we could exchange information.

Thanks. Best Regards, Eleonore.

Subject: CRUST-L: Re:Sleeping crayfish Down Under

Yes even crayfish down under like their bellies tickled and it seems the
female is best.
I saw this done in front of me in Western Australia Perth with a 500 gram
Panulirus cygnus George.( Spiny crayfish) We were in a live lobster holding
facility and the manager held it and stroked across the parts mentioned and
the animal went into a trance like state. To prove this the lobster was
turned up side down and gently stood on it's head on a Stainless steel
bench. I took photographs of it and timed it still motionless 2 minutes
later, and they said they have seen them last up to 5 minutes like that.
When the animal was put down on it's legs after 2 minutes it took about 15
seconds to awake from the trance.
I will try to find the photo's and put on the email as a jpg file. I used
to have them hanging up in my trade stands at fishing conferences, always
created a laugh with the fisherman who had known about the phenomena, and
no doubt it was a crazy fisherman who did it in the first place, not a
scientific experiment.
But what is interesting, is this induced trance  used by the buck when it
mates with the female, the way the buck mates with the female  standing up
at each other face to face, to mate.?

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: sleeping crayfish

Scratch the crawdads on the ventral or dorsal surface? If the ventral,
since the nerve cord in just beneath the cuticle, perhaps scratching there
is like bashing ones funny bone (the brachial nerve). Given the way my
elbow feels after bumping the nerve, I can imagine a crayfish might be "put
to sleep".

Subject: CRUST-L: Traskorchestia

I would like to thank all of those who reponded to my Anonyx posting, if I
didn't respond yet, I am working on it!

I recently keyed out a very abundant upper intertidal gammarid from Juneau
to Traskorchestia georgiana (Bousfield, 1952). A friend of mine believes
this is the same species he has found in Seward. I was wondering if anyone
had range information for this species, or happen to know if there other
Traskorchestia with hair-like (thin and small) pleopods in the Northeastern
Pacific (I am using Craig Staude's keys for Washington) Thanks- Aaron

Subject: CRUST-L: Hypnosis?!

Following the comments made by Jeff about sleeping Crayfish, I have heard
of a similar situation in the Euro Lobster (H.gammarus). Apparently, a
fisherman told me that if you take the animal and balance it on the tip of
its rostrum, it will go into a similar state noted by Jeff.

May be true, may be not....haven't got time to try it myself, too busy
working!

Have a go

Dear Andy,

During my stay in Seychelles I tried some diets for Cardisoma carnifex.
The main problem was getting them to eat something, so I was not able to
sea on which diets they would grow best.
The things I tried were : commercial shrimp pellets, cat food, layer
feed, rotten leaves, papaya leaves, coconuts, trash fish.
The trash fish disappeared, but I think it were rats who took it.
The feed which was consumed most was definitely the coconut meat. Shrimp
pellets and cat food were consumed also.

Please keep me informed if you would find something. I am still very
interested in this matter.

Thanks and best regards,

Dear Friends,

I will attend both Iso-2 and ICC-4 this July in Amsterdam. It*s difficult
to find a proper place to stay after trying to contact some hotels in
Amsterdam. So I just want to know whether some people, female participants

i wanted to remind you of my database on crustacean neuro-, bio-, etho-
refs. it is on the web and can be searched at:

http://wwwzoo.kfunigraz.ac.at/cgi-bin/lit_findlinks.html

the term histamine found 109 refs (most with abstarcts), such as:

Arnould JM

Biosynthesis and metabolism of histamine in the central nervous system of
Carcinus maenas]

Arch Int Physiol Biochim (1987) 95: 43-55

The central nervous system of Carcinus maenas synthesizes radioactive
histamine when incubated in the presence of [14C] histidine and
pyridoxal-5' phosphate. This biosynthesis increases linearly as a function
of the amount of enzyme and the incubation time. It is not effected by
heart, muscle or hepatopancreas extracts nor by haemolymph. Thus histamine
appears to be synthesized mainly in the nervous system. The latter is also
the seat of carcinine (beta-alanylhistamine) biosynthesis. Since carcinine
seems to be a product of histamine neutralization, histamine metabolism
should take place in its entirety in the nervous system. Thus histamine
appears to be implicated in the neuronal activity of Carcinus. Different
areas of the crustacean central nervous system: brain, eyestalks and
thoracic ganglionic mass biosynthesize and metabolize histamine. Thus they
all could contain sites of action for histamine. The nervous systems of two
other Decapodes, Cancer and Astacus also effect histamine biosynthesis but
don't metabolize it into carcinine.

Histamine: a putative afferent neurotransmitter in Limulus eyes

Journal of Comparative Neurology (1991) 305: 527-42

Histamine has been proposed as a photoreceptor neurotransmitter in two
major groups of arthropods, the insects and the crustacea. In this study
biochemical and immunocytochemical approaches were used to examine the
synthesis, endogenous content, and cellular distribution of histamine in
the visual system of the horseshoe crab Limulus polyphemus, an ancient
chelicerate arthropod. Studies with this animal have been critical to our
understanding of the basic processes of vision. High-voltage paper
electrophoresis was used to assay for histamine synthesis in Limulus
tissues incubated with radiolabeled histidine; histamine synthesis was
detected in the lateral, median, and ventral eyes and optic nerves and in
the visual centers in the brain. Endogenous histamine, assayed as its
orthophthalaldehyde derivative by high-performance liquid chromatography
and electrochemical detection, was also detected in these tissues.
Immunocytochemical analyses, with an antiserum directed against a protein
conjugate of histamine, revealed histamine-like immunoreactivity in the
somata of photoreceptors in each of the eyes and in the regions of the
brain where the photoreceptors terminate. Histamine-like immunoreactivity
was also intense in the cell bodies and axon collaterals of eccentric cells
in the lateral eye and in eccentric cell projections in the brain. These
results show that histamine is a major biogenic amine in the Limulus visual
system, and they suggest that this amine is involved in transmitting visual
information from the eyes to the brain and in lateral inhibition, a
fundamental mechanism for processing visual information in the lateral eye.

my reading of the literature is that histamine is a true neuromodulatory
amine in crustaceans, particularly of the visual system - along the lines
of other biogenic amines such as serotonin or octopamine.

i didnt find much though about histamine in allergic reactions in
crustaceans though, sorry.

hope this helps, ciao,
lobsterman

My Dad is a commercial lobsterman in Maine and I grew up working on the
lobster boat.  To break the boredom at lunch time, we used to stand the
lobsters on their rostrum and claws (making a lobster tripod) and
stroke the top of their thorax from just below the rostrum to the end of
the thorax and put them to "sleep".  The lobsters would stay like that
until we put them back into a crawling postion.

Dear colleagues:

I will be most grateful if someone informs me the latest (FAO's 1996?)
world-wide figure for aquaculture production (fresh-water and marine
organisms) and, if possible, their value. The value for only marine
organisms, if know, will also be most valuable.

The latest figures I have are FAO's 1995 statistics.

Dear Andy,
	Tina Carvalho forwarded your inquiry to the
Crustacean Net.  I've worked with captive Cardisoma (guanumi
and more recently carnifex) since 1968.  I've used Purina
rat chow (now sold as "rodent" chow) as the basic diet, and
the crabs seem to do alright on it.  We supplement sometimes
with veggie scraps from the supermarket - lettuce, cabbage,
broccoli stems, etc.  Might be they should get a bit of
protein sometimes; I'd not claim this diet is totally
sufficient, as the crabs, regardless of size, have never
molted in captivity (I've had individuals over a year). 
Could be that they need a burrow and privacy to go into
molt.  We hold the animals in wire cages and supply fresh
and sea water in separate flower pot saucers large enough
for them to nearly immerse themselves in.  We also supply
small clay pots for individual shelters.  C. carnifex males
(I'm only allowed to import males to Honolulu), unlike
guanumi, don't tear each other up when held at close
quarters in a cage.  With C. guanumi, the claws had to be
tied against the body if they were to be kept together. 
	Great animals.  Have fun!

Subject: CRUST-L: Actograph

Dear fellows,

I wish to construct an actograph based on infrared emitters and
detectors, for use with crab zoeae. My interest is to study
rhythmic vertical migrations of the larvae. The descriptions I
found in the literature, so far, are either inappropriate in the level
of technical detail they give, or concern actographs that are not
accurate enough to detect individual zoeae.

Can anybody out there provide me references on devices of this kind
that can detect individual 1 mm (perhaps slightly less) crab zoeae?
Information on manufacturers of components would also be greatly
appreciated.

Many thanks,

Subject: CRUST-L: Induced lethargy in crabs

The recent thread about inducing lethargy in crawfish reminded me of a time
years ago when my colleague, Tom Savage, showed me how to induce lethargy in
the Florida stone crab, Menippe mercenaria.  Tom was studying claw
regeneration by that species in the early 1970s, because there is a fishery
for the claws here and the law requires fishers to return the animal to the
water.  I do not know how he discovered the method of inducing lethargy, but
he used it frequently in order to prevent having his fingers crushed by the
powerful claws.  The method involved using a thin straightedge, such as a
short plastic ruler, the edge of which he placed in the mesial groove at the
front of the carapace between the eyes.  After Tom stroked the groove with the
edge of the ruler for one or two minutes, the crab would become completely
limp and stay that way for several minutes after the ruler was taken away.
The state of lethargy gave Tom the opportunity to take all the measurements he
needed from the crab with complete safety.  I always thought it would make a
nifty parlor trick, but there are so few stone crabs in parlors these days, it
is a difficult trick to exhibit.

Dear All,

In Fiji, I have kept Cardisoma carnifax in captivity and they seemed to
do well with a mixture/variety of diet including grated coconut kernel
(matured nuts that become brown on the outside and have about a 1cm
thick kernel inside), chicken pellets, leafy vegetables.  They
successfully molted in captivity when shelters such as old tyres, etc
are provided.  In Fiji, this species is caught (usually soon after
rains, when they come out of their flooded burrows, especially at night)
and sold in local markets for about US$5.00 for a bundle of 10.  After
capture, the crabs are sometimes held in captivity and fed on grated
coconut kernel until they are taken to the market and sold.  The method
of capture of large numbers is very interesting, but that's another
story....

Subject: CRUST-L: Induced lethargy in crabs

In New Zealand we have an intertidal belliid crab, Heterozius 
rotundifrons, in which the males have a very much larger right 
cheliped than females. Excessive handling of the males results in 
them spreading their chelipeds to the fullest extent and becoming 
completely paralytic! The chelipeds are locked in position and the 
crab seems to be dead. Perhaps this is a case of self-induced 
lethargy? Left undisturbed for  several minutes the crab simply gets 
up and runs off.

Dear List members,

I guess I'll re-post my request for nephropid muscle samples.
Could anyone out there send a claw (or whole specimen, of course)
of Thaumastocheles, Thaumastochelopsis, Homarinus, Thymopides,
Thymopsis, Thymops, Nephropsis, Nephropides, Eunephrops or
Acanthacaris?

My colleagues and I have begun the long process of testing morphology-based
clawed lobster phylogenies (e.g. Tshudy and Babcock, 1997, Journal of
Crustacean Biology 17(2):253-263) with molecular data.
We need muscle samples, shipped in alcohol or on dry ice, from all recent
genera.  We have begun sequencing Homarus and Metanephrops, and have
Nephrops and some outgroup reps. on the way (thanks to those who replied
last week), but need all the genera listed above.

We can pay for postage, packing, etc.

If anyone out there could help, I'll e-mail details (address, etc.).
Thanks for your time.

Subject: CRUST-L: Male-only fisheries...?

Hi all, I am trying to ascertain the likely ecological implications 
of a policy which would prohibit the capture of female spiny lobsters 
in a moderate-sized (~ 2000 MT p.a.), directed, trap fishery for 
lobsters in shallow (5-100 m) coastal waters.  The fishery is 
currently managed by means of a minimum legal size, which already 
forces it towards a male-dominated catch.  Harvest proportions are 
around 30%.

The literature provides contrasting opinions (mainly studies on
crabs) on whether or not the potential reduction in abundance of
large males (or alteration of sex ratio) will influence mating
success. 

Any ideas?

Subject: CRUST-L: glycogen 

CRUSTlers,

Have any of you quantified glycogen levels recently?  I'm comparing the 
Dubois  (phenol oxidation), the glucose HK (enzymatic conversion), and the 
anthrone (carbohydrate reduction) methods.  Funny how published results 
show little variation between the three (except when using nerve tissue) 
while our lab results show significant variation.  I'd like to expand 
sampling using the Dubois method because its signficantly cheaper and 
more efficient.  We're proceeding to spike unknowns to look at recovery 
issues.  Any insights would be appreciated.  

Cheers, Jeff

For participants of the 4th ICC in Amsterdam who are interested in 
low budget accomodations or sharing hotel rooms: here are some useful 
web sites and links, with phone numbers etc. that might help you find 
something affordable. Maybe you have to drill yourself through a 
couple of pages. My tip: start with the Arena and try to make 
reservations (and do it soon, because Amsterdam is pretty packed
during the summer); if they don't have anything available, they might 
give you some information about cheap alternatives.

Jeff, the following won't add any insights but is related to the Dubois
method. I think the Dubois method measures total sugar, including ribose
and deoxyribose (the reaction is not as chromogenic with deoxyribose
compared to glucose if my memory is correct). This would mean that DNA
and RNA are also included in the measurement. I've always wondered
whether this would affect one's results, especially in organisms where
the ratio of stored glucogen to RNA or DNA is low. Does anyone have data
or insight?

Subject: CRUST-L: Male-only fisheries...?

Dave:

Some have maintained that male only harvest strategies for crab are an
artifact of updland game management practices that may be more
appropriate for K-selection than R-selection type animals.   However, most
Dungeness crab fisheries on the west coast of north america have been,
for the most part, very well sustained under this type of management.  A
minimum size established to allow all males to reach sexual maturity
before they may be legally harvested and retained and a prohibition on
harvest of females seems to protect reproductive capacity.  It helps that
males are polygamous.   

Published and unpublished data indicates that females almost always mate
with substantially larger males.  This begs the questions of whether the
larger females do not get inseminated because of the high exploitation
(usually assumed to be over 90%) of legal size males, and whether this
matters.   These questions were addressed in a recent paper by Hankin et
al. (Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences: 54: 655-669,
1997.   This report suggests that egg production loss caused by harvest
of larger males has a minimal impact on recruitment.  The authors make a
compelling argument based on study of a northern California population. 
However, the various parameters and feed back loops are complex.  

It would be interesting to evaluate whether fishery timing could be further
adjusted to optimize opportunity for larger females to mate (seasons are
currently established to minimize mortality to soft shell males due to
cannibalism within traps and handling). 

Enough of my ramblings!

Henrique and other interested parties,

Although I cannot provide info on the actograph realm, I can offer a
differing solution that may or may not suit your needs: infrared video
microscopy.  To check out what kind of system we are using currently, try
pointing your browser at:

http://userwww.sfsu.edu/~bioocean/minitowers/minitower.html

We are using a video-microscope in combination with 2-m tall minitanks to
study vertical migration in zooplankters that are 0.25 mm to 5 mm.  We have
found this system to be pretty stable and easy to use after the initial
setup process.

Subject: CRUST-L: Quiescent Crabs

Hi All,

Just to add to the mix - 

Male fiddler crabs that mate on the surface with their neighbors,
"court," first with rapid leg taps or scratches typically directed to
the sides of the females carapace, then with extensive
stroking/scratching with their minor claw around the females orbits,
retracted eye stalks, and anterior third or so of her carapace (top
and sides).  I had thought they might be tasting urine but perhaps,
as suggested by recent postings, this tactile stimulation simply has
a "calming" effect. It may be a way males tip the scales a bit
relative to a male-female conflict of interest during mating. Mating
pairs are remarkably tolerant of stimuli that normally startle them,
and thus they probably are at additional predation risk.  My
impression has been that it is the female that breaks off when a
predator comes near, though the male has a greater distance to return
to his burrow. So males may, by tickling females, increase their 
startle response threshold to match or exceed their own.  Pure
specualtive pap of course, but fun to think about.

I will soon try tickling a female fiddler crab or two.   

Where on earth did this response come from and is it, as the post
suggests, general?  Is this an accident of how crusties are wired, or
is there a reason (evolved function) to sit tight when tickled?

Cheers,
John

The rock lobster Jasus edwardsii fishery around Tasmania has a range of
management devices in place including a minimum legal size.  Growth rate of
rock lobsters varies around the island so that females in the southern part
of the state generally die before reaching legal size.  We've had
recaptures from females released over 17 years ago that have still not
reached legal size.  Males do reach legal size and this region has very
high exploitation so most males are harvested in their first year above
legal size.  This has resulted in a skewed sex ratio which seems to be
around 5 females for each male.

Jac Gibson and Stewart Frusher have conducted a series of tank based trials
to find the number of females that a male can successfully mate with.
Mating occurs at the time of the female moult which is highly synchronised,
so the males only had a short period to mate with females in tanks.  Gibson
and Frusher found that males in tanks could mate with at least 16 females
which was reassuring.  However there are other issues to be considered.
For instance: tank trials force all animals into close proximity, this may
not be typical of the natural situation; male lobsters need to be larger
than females so most of the males in the wild population may not be of much
use; the size of functional maturity of males has not been assessed in any
population around Tasmania; the effect of sex ratios skewed to towards
females on fecundity has not been tested (that is - do the males begin to
run out of sperm so that fertilisation rate is reduced ?); and flucuations
in recruitment could result in ratios of males to females dramatically
different from what we've got at present.  Of some concern is that we see
occasional females during the winter months which we call RUT's - "red
under the tail".  These females have bright red haemolymph which causes the
membrane on the ventral side of the abdomen to become red.  From tank
trials, it appears that this can occur when females haven't mated and they
then resorb their ovary (and carotenoids in the developing oocytes).  The
presence of RUT females in samples from the south coast may be due to sperm
limitation in this region.

Hi all, I am trying to ascertain the likely ecological implications
of a policy which would prohibit the capture of female spiny lobsters
in a moderate-sized (~ 2000 MT p.a.), directed, trap fishery for
lobsters in shallow (5-100 m) coastal waters.  The fishery is
currently managed by means of a minimum legal size, which already
forces it towards a male-dominated catch.  Harvest proportions are
around 30%.
The literature provides contrasting opinions (mainly studies on
crabs) on whether or not the potential reduction in abundance of
large males (or alteration of sex ratio) will influence mating
success.
Any ideas?

Subject: CRUST-L: RE: Induced lethargy in crabs

Hi all,

I have been following some of the conversations as a subscriber for a few 
months and finally I have something to add. 

While working as a volunteer out at the Bodega Bay Marine lab I remember the 
facility manager (Art Hertz) putting American lobsters (Homarus)in this "so 
called" trance like state and sitting them upside down on one of the lab 
tables. Once he would flip them back over it would take a few seconds before 
the animal would "come to" I often thought that it was unfortunate that no 
one knew what the mechanism is or what chemicals may be released during this 
process because it sure would have made it easier on me when taking 
haemolymph samples on lobsters without bands on their claws.
    
On another note: Colin Mclay wrote how excessive handling of male 
Heterozious rotundifrons causes them to spread their chelipeds  to the 
fullest extent and become completely paralytic. Could this be some sort of 
defense strategy...perhaps a crab is simply making itself harder for a 
predator to swallow. Also, Iam not sure if Iam using this term right (please 
correct me if I am wrong), but this almost sounds like some form of "tonic 
inhibition" where a prey will freeze followed by a burst of movement away 
from a potential predator. 

Best Wishes,

Grant

P.S. Hello Jeff Shields. Not sure if you remember me or not but we stayed in 
     Miwock at Bodega Bay around the same time. I was working with Ernie 
     Chang at the time (Aggression in female lobsters)

Hi All,

        I work on swarming and schooling behaviour in aquatic crustaceans
particularly mysids and euphausiids. I'm struck by the fact that others
working on animals that are obligately gregarious often hold their
experimental subjects singly or in groups too small to constitute
aggregations. This approach seems to ignore the possibility that the close
presence of conspecifics might alter the behaviour or physiology in some
important way(s). It is known that individuals in small groups of social
species behave differently to those in large groups. For example, schooling
fish in small groups forage less succesfully, spend less time feeding and
presumably would grow more slowly than those in large groups. Mysids in
small groups also feed less successfully than those in large groups. Does
anyone have data on a comparison between solitary and group response for
such functions as food intake, gut passage time, heart rate, oxygen uptake,
moulting etc.?

David,

Holding gregarious animal individually does not necessarily ignore the 
effects of their behaviour but can be used to eliminate or minimize that 
effect.  For example, with many crustaceans growth will be hetergeneous as 
groups and more homogeneous as individuals.  This allows one to eliminate 
"error" in experimental design and allow one to look at a limited number of 
factors (e.g., nutritional requirements).

Subject: CRUST-L: Quiescent shrimps

Hello all,

    I've been following the discussion on quiescent animals with interest.
In a message a couple of days ago, the question arose as to the
evolutionary significance of such a response. With respect to this, there
appears to be a strong advantage gained from a type of quiescence which
affects the tail-flip behaviour of crayfish, lobsters, shrimps and other
such crustaceans. In a paper by Krasne and Wine in 1975 (J. exp Biol, vol
63, pp433-450), they found that tail-flips were severely suppressed in
crayfish held by the thorax. However, on loosening one's grip, a tail-flip
immediately occurred. I've noticed a similar type of response in the
European brown shrimp, Crangon crangon (quite useful for transferring
shrimps from tank to tank without exhausting them). In experiments in which
relatively small cod predated upon shrimp, the significance of the
quiescence became apparent. When a cod captures a shrimp large enough to
require manipulation in the mouth before swallowing, the cod often swims
around with the shrimp in its mouth, periodically stopping to readjust the
shrimp into a position from which it can be swallowed. Whilst it is being
carried around, the shrimp generally remains pretty still, but the instant
the cod tries to transfer its grip, a tail-flip occurs, allowing the shrimp
to escape (escape success increases with relative shrimp size). This
appears to be a nifty trick which takes the cod by surprise and enhances
the shrimp's chances of survival.

Hi
	Very interesting- I've noticed a similar suppression of the 
tail-flip response in hippolytid shrimps held by fish. 
	Some years ago a commercial fisherman tried to show me how he could 
"put Dungeness crabs to sleep" by stroking the underside, but the 
demonstration wasn't particularly impressive- certainly nothing like 
standing a lobster on its nose. 
	The behavior described for lobsters reminds me of the response 
you get when you stroke the belly of an anolis, iguana or other lizard, 
and I wonder if anyone knows the mechanism involved in that case.  It 
also brings to mind the "Far Side" cartoon of a husband and wife- their 
canoe being eaten by a giant crocodile- and the wife screaming "Rub his belly, 
Ernie, rub his belly!"

Dear CRUSTLers,

We are carrying out a quantitative study of the age pigment (lipofuscin)
accumulation in brains of Penaeus japonicus cultured in ponds. The oldest
specimens we used were 1.3 y old, but from the analysis of the data, we
would estimate that under our experimental conditions the theoretical
maximum age to be reached in this species is about 3-3.5 years. Is this a
good approach? Does anyone out there know the estimated longevity of this
species? Thanks in advance for your help.

Subject: CRUST-L: measuring volumes



Dear Crust-lers,

Has anyone had any success at measuring the body-volumes of individual,
tiny zooplankton?

In order to link some plankton samples I have (taken with a 0.5mm mesh
net) to high-frequency acoustic data showing abundance of different size
classes of organisms, I am seeking to obtain a distribution of body size,
as volume, of the crustacean organisms in my samples. 

The plankton was composed of mostly crab and shrimp zoea, but also
included copepods and barnacle nauplii, and many other things. The very
smallest critter in my sample has a body size of about 0.005 mm^3 or 5
nanoliters. Ideally something with which I could measure the size of
individuals from the samples with a resolution of 1 nanoliter is sought. 

I have thought of trying to bracket their specific gravity and using a
"microgram balance". Or (although I am not sure what equipment to use)
measuring cross-sections from many different angles (lazer?) and having a
computer interpolate the volume from the geometry. 

If you have any suggestions, ideas, or information on this, or if you have
ever attempted it yourself, I would greatly appreciate hearing about it.

(Also, the samples have been fixed in formalin and are stored in ethanol.)

Thank you!

Dear colleagues,

Does anyone know whether the cumacean Pseudocuma gilsoni Bacescu, 
1950 is still a valid species? The species is included in Jones' 
Synopsis of the British Fauna, but he suggests that it may be a 
neotenous form of the male of P. longicornis. We found several 
individuals conforming with the description from the stomachs of sole 
Solea solea collected from sandy beaches in Belgium. Any references 
reporting about this species would be very welcome.

Thanks in advance and very best wishes,
Jan

The ICC-4 web site now has a draft schedule of the oral and poster sessions
of the crustacean congress.  Although there will undoubtedly be some
changes from this before July arrives, you can check out the site and get
an idea of some of what will be happening.

Subject: CRUST-L: Acartia tumida

Dear crusters

A rather obscure question I'm afraid but thought someone out their might
have an answer.

I'm intersted in trying to get any references (except the one given below*)
on the egg and adult female weights of the Arctic species Acartia tumida.
Alternatively does anyone have experience with this species or access to
adult and egg carbon weights (or length weight relationships for the
adult/copepodites) of their own?

*Hassett,R.P., Duggins,D.O. and Simenstad,C.A. (1993) Egg production rates
of the neritic marine copepod Acartia tumida Willey in the Aleutian
Archipelago. Polar Biol., 13, 515-523.

Thanks in advance.

Dear crabbologists,

I have a little puzzle for you. I am studying the crab remainings within
the stomach of some Scylla serrata from Mozambique. The Scylla have been
fished in a mangroves but where they have been actually feeding and how far
from the mangroves, it is unknown. 

We can usually identify all decapod remainings to the species or genus
level but now, in fron of me, I have a little puzzle. A small crab has been
fully chewed, of which I only can get entire leg dactyluses. In the
(horrible) attached image I am sending you, you will ses how a dactylus
looks like. The dactylus is quite thin giving the idea of a good swimmer
instead of a good runner or digger (i.e. it is not an ocypodid for sure !).
It is not wide or hairy enough to be a Varuna. I can easily manage without
identifying my specimen, the Big Science will not suffer and my work on
Scylla feeding preference will go ahead safely. I am simply curious ...
does anybody have an idea bout it ?

Subject: CRUST-L: Rotifer Cultures

Fellow members
Could anyone direct me to a good reference for the culture of rotifers in 
the laboratory. I am looking at a system that would be fairly small, not 
on a large scale. The rotifers will be used as a food source for the 
culture of decapod larvae. I do not have a large amount of space 
available and so would need a fairly small system. 
If anyone has personal suggestions that have worked for them (eg designs 
etc) I would really appreciate this input.
Best regards

Estimado Jose Luis
	Durante los meses pasados tuve la oportunidad de examinar los penes de =
juveniles y adultos de Tumidotheres maculatus de Argentina y la =
transformacion en esta especie es semejante a la que anote en el =
articulo donde el genero Tumidotheres es nombrado (Campos, E. 1989. =
Journal of Crustacean Biology 9(4): 672-679). El canal espermatico y la =
"lengueta" terminal es solo evidente en especimenes adultos. Nota que la =
presencia de setas natatorias en los pereiopodos 2 y 3 tambien pueden =
ayudar, sin embargo el gonopodo es mejor. Respecto a las hembras una =
idea que se me ocurre es que compares la setacion de los pleopodos de =
una hembra gravida con la que no esta gravida. Las setas donde se =
cementan los huevecillos pueden ser un indicador de proximidad a la fase =
de gravides. Es importante recordar que aparentemente el sistema =
reproductor primario de la hembra madura  por etapas. El gonoporo, =
gonoducto y el receptaculo seminal  reciben el pene y los =
espermatozoides cuando la hemba esta en fase dura (morfologicamente =
semejante al macho). En fase duran los ovarios no son maduros aun, estos =
maduran despues de varias mudas cuando el abdomen ya ha ensanchado y los =
pleopodos se han alargado. Por tal motivo seria prudente que definieras =
a que se van a referir con madurez. Capacidad de copular o capacidad de =
ser gravida. Espero que mis comentarios les ayuden.
	Si no tienes el articulo que anote arriba dimelo y te mando una copia. =
Una abrazo. Ernesto.

Hi Dear Colleagues

I have a student working on the reproductive biology of Tumidotheres
maculatus, and as part of the study she most determine the size at
maturity. the problem is that we dont know how to establish if a male
individual or a non-ovigerous female is adult or juvenile. Do you know =
if
there is a way of doing that?

thanks in advance

Subject: CRUST-L: Exotic crayfish removal

Crusties:

I have been contacted by a local rancher who has had non-native
Pacifastacus leniusculus recently invade a spring he uses for irrigation.
Unfortunately for him, the animals enter his irrigation system and plug
the pipes when the diameter is reduced at joints and sprinkler heads.  He
claims that fencing and screening has been tried unsucessfully and is
looking for some sort of selective toxicant which can be used to reduce or
elimenate the crayfish.  Does anyone have any suggestions??

Thanks.

Subject: CRUST-L: crayfish abdominal appendages


As an amateur naturalist, I have noticed that about 50% of commercial
table crawfish (spp?) available in East Texas seem to sport a small
pair of club-like "extra" appendages on each of two abdominal
segments.  My guess would be that this is an instance of sexual
dimorphism and that the appendages serve some sexual or reproductive
function.  Can anyone explain to me:

1) Whether this hypothesis is correct

and 

2) What are the embryogenetic and/or phylogenetic explanations of
these appendages?  Are they embryogenetically or phylogenetically
"true" limbs deriving from a stage prior to the specialization of the
abdominal segments as limbless, or do they represent a secondary
adaptation?

TIA.

Subject: CRUST-L: carbon dioxide measurement

Hello Everyone,

I am measuring oxygen consumption rates in several crayfish species and I
would like to determine R/Q values. However, I do not currently have access
to a CO2 gas analyzer. Does anyone have an accurate method for the
measurement of total carbon dioxide in freshwater samples without using a
CO2 gas analyzer?

Can the total CO2 content be determined accurately based on the independent
measurment of the bicarbonate (measured as alkalinity) and the dissolved
CO2 (measured as pH)?  I have been reviewing some of the older literature
on the subject and this is cited as one method to determine total CO2, but
I am afraid it may not be sensitive enough to measure the change in CO2
over a short time period.

Thanks in adavance for your help.

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: carbon dioxide measurement

Dear Mickey,
   Measuring the R/Q of aquatic animals, esp. decapods, is difficult; not
only is total CO2 in water tricky to measure, but the animals exchange
bicarbonate with the water for acid-base regulation (e.g., marine crabs at
rest typically excrete bicarbonate in exchange for an inorganic cation,
which may have nothing to do with metabolic CO2 excretion; on the other
hand, crabs show a very high rate of bicarbonate uptake, again in exchange
for a cation, associated with carapace calcification).  I recall hearing
that Jim Cameron (formerly at UT-Austin marine lab) kept getting R/Q's for
blue crabs of 5-10, or thereabouts.

    You will find a good discussion of the problems and some techniques for
measuring total CO2 in water in: Cameron, J.N., 1986, Principles of
Physiological Measurement, Academic Press.  Most techniques involve
acidification of the water and measurement of the evolved CO2 gas.   About
10 or so years ago, Bob Boutilier (now at the Zoology Dept., Cambridge, UK,
and editor of Journal of Experimental Biology) published a paper (in
Respiration Physiology, I think) describing a very sensitive method using a
gas chromatograph, although I don't have the reference handy.  I can try to
locate it for you, if you are unable to find it.
   Your suggestion for measuring alkalinity and pH to get total CO2 has
some problems, I think.  What you really want to measure is dissolved CO2
(i.e., PCO2) and any bicarbonate formed when respiratory CO2 reacts with
water.  Standard methods for measuring titratable alkalinity will only give
you bicarbonate (and any carbonate) associated with with inorganic cations;
they won't give you the 'respiratory' portion of bicarbonate.  Also, you
can determine changes in PCO2 based on changes in pH, but you would need to
measure pH anaerobically (e.g., using a 'blood-gas' type capillary pH
electrode), and you would have to prepare a calibration curve by
equilibrating the water to various known PCO2's and then measure the pH at
each PCO2.

I would be willing to bet that someone in your med school or physiology
department has a CO2 analyzer for measuring total CO2 in plasma and other
body fluids- perhaps you could borrow one?   Be aware that a Cameron
Instrument  Co. Capni-Con analyzer is probably the only instrument that is
sensitive enough for your needs; a Corning CO2 analyzer, which is also
popular in medical labs, is probably not sensitive enough to pick up the
small changes in total CO2 that your crayfish will produce.  Also, I think
Chris Wood (McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario) recently (past year or
so) published some data on R/Q's in FW fish (in Journal of exp. Biology, I
think); you might check out his methods and what he has to say about this.
Good luck,
Chuck Booth

Subject: CRUST-L: Back to Mole Crabs


Does anyone have or know where I can get information on harvesting of mole
crabs - where are they harvested? How many pounds are harvested per year?
Are the havested mole crabs used only as fishing bait ?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: CRUST-L: Identifing Kansas Crayfish

Hi crusters,
   I recently moved here to Emporia Kansas and have began studying the
crayfish here.  I have little experience with Crayfish (I come from a
marine - lobster background).  My problem is that I am nervous about
IDing them.  I am using two keys, one is new and is called the Crayfish
of Missouri.  The other key is from 1952, "The crayfish of Kansas" by A.
Williams and A.B. Leonard. 
    I think that all the crayfish that I have collect so far are Orconectes
virilis, (use to be nais?) but I would like to make particularly sure that
they are not Orconectes immunis.
  The two Keys seem to contradict each other quite a bit, the new key
shows the antennal scales of both of these species as being the same
shape, while the Williams key shows the antennal scale of immunis to
be of a different shape.
  If anyone out there know the crayfish of this area and can help me I
would be really grateful!

Thanks in advance

ANNOUNCING
The first NATIONAL CONFERENCE on MARINE BIOINVASIONS

CONVENED BY THE MIT SEA GRANT COLLEGE PROGRAM
CALL FOR PAPERS
ABSTRACTS DUE 9/1/98

The first National Conference on Marine Bioinvasions will focus on
biological invasions of exotic species in coastal, estuarine and marine
ecosystems.  An emphasis will be on ballast water research and management,
ecological and genetic consequences of invasions, diversity in time and
space, transport vectors (unintentional and intentional), economic costs and
status of predictive tools for assisting managers.

We are seeing papers in all areas, and will be devoting a special section to
ballast water research including new and proposed approaches for minimizing
releases, e.g. ballast water research, fouling organisms, and intentional
and unintentional aquaculture releases.

Dates:  January 24 - 27, 1999
Location:  Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Cambridge, MA  USA

If you are interested in learning more about the conference or are likely to
submit an abstract or poster abstract, send your name and address to Judith
Pederson, MIT Sea Grant College Program, 292 Main Street E38-300, Cambridge,
MA 02129, email:  jpederso@mit.edu, fax: 617-252-1615.

We are excited about the conference and look forward to seeing you there.

Subject: CRUST-L: re:crayfish preservation

List Members,

I am hoping that someone can provide me with a method of preserving 
crayfish that will allow them to maintain a semblance of their life 
colours (if such a method exists).  I am currently preserving with 
10% formalin for 3 days and storing them in 70% ethanol.  This 
technique seemed to work initially with the specimens retaining most 
of their colouring.  However, after a week or so most turn red.  
Previously, I had preserved  them in 70% ethanol and stored them in 
fresh 70% a few days later and they eventually turned white.  Is this 
the best one can expect?

Thanks in advance,

Subject: CRUST-L: ICC-4

We at ICC-4 have had numerous requests from students and scientists from
developing countries for assistance with congress expenses, especially
registration fees and hotel costs in Amsterdam.  The congress board has had
some success in raising funds from various sources to support eastern
European and third world colleagues.  However, the funds raised so far can
support only a limited number of people, and the waiting list is still
long, especially for graduate students.

Recently, we have had some money donated by private individuals to the
ICC-4 specifically to support students from developing countries.  If there
are any other "first world" colleagues out there who might also want to
donate funds for this worthy cause, please contact Fred Schram:

The University of Amsterdam congress bureau, who is helping us run ICC-4,
tells us that they have NEVER encountered a group of congress participants
so devoted to the use of e-mail!  That being the case, we think it a good
idea to broadcast some information over oral presentations in Amsterdam in
a few weeks.

Oral talks are scheduled for 15 minutes each.  We recommend that you plan
to speak for 10-12 minutes and allow some time for questions or comments.
However, the 15 minutes is yours to do with as you wish, and if you take 15
minutes to talk -- so be it.

However, with simultaneous sessions, we will be ruthless in regulating the
time schedule.  If you try to exceed your allocated 15 minutes, a trap door
will open under the podium and you will be flushed into a canal.

Practice your talks carefully!

Dear fellow scientists,

Is there anyone who could help and answer our questions:

1. A method for approximation of freshwater crayfish population in streams
and lakes. How many individuals it takes to make the research statistically
significant?
2. A method for determination of molt stages of Astacus astacus
morphological, immunohistochemical or any other method.
3. Anticoagulant for hemolymph of Astacidae (apart from 5% sodium
polyanethol sulfate).

If the answer is satisfactory we'll buy you a beer in Augsburg!

		Thanks in advance,

I am a post graduate student of Environmental Microbiology at the =
University of  Benin, Nigeria. My Ph.D research is on the impact of =
dredging operations on biological resouces of a mangrove ecosystem in =
the Niger Delta. The reseach is in 3 phases, namely:-

Pre-dredging baseline data aquisition
Monitoring during dredging operations, and=20
Post-dredging impact monitoring.

During the 3 phase monitoring, biological (phyto- & zoo-plankton), =
physico-chemical and microbiological analysis will be carried out. =
Laboratory models with the sole aim of reducing the impact of dredging =
will be developed.=20

I have completed the first phase of the work, and currently preparing =
for the second phase.

The major obstacle to this reseach, is the lack of literatures in this =
area of study. To this effect, I will be very grateful if you could =
assist me with some literatures or at least send me the names/addresses =
of other organisation(s) that could help.

Yours faithfully,

Subject: Paul Illg (1915-1998)

University of Washington Emeritus Professor of Zoology Paul Illg died
on May 10, 1998 at the age of 83.  He was a notable scholar of
invertebrate zoology, and a life-long worker on parasitic copepods.   A
Californian native, he came under the tutelage in the 1930s at the
University of California at Berkeley of the legendary professor S . F.
Light (for whom Light's Manual is named, and to which Paul contributed
the copepod (free-living and parasitic) chapter for the Third Edition
in 1975).  From 1947 to 1952 he was Associate Curator of Crustacea at
the Smithsonian Institution, during which time he also earned his Ph.D.
at George Washington University.  He was a member of the UW faculty
since 1952, and taught for many years at  the Friday Harbor
Laboratories on San Juan Island, where he also maintained a beach home.
  According to The Seattle Times of 16 May, after he retired in 1983,
"he taught marine biology in eastern Micronesia. He considered teaching
native people the relationships between reef plants and animals one of
his most rewarding experiences."  One of his many life-long interests
was art, and he collected both Asian and Native American works.  His
survivors include his wife of 51 years, Ruth, his son Joseph Illg of
Seattle, and his daughters Elizabeth Illg of Friday Harbor and Maliki
Tara of Maui, Hawaiian Islands.  A memorial gathering will be held
August 8 on Illg Beach at Friday Harbor.


In a letter that Paul wrote to me on February 4, 1998, he expressed his
regrets at not being able to participate in contributing to the Fourth
Edition of Light's (now The Light and Smith) Manual.   As always, it
was a kind, thoughtful, and gentlemanly letter.

Dear Crust-lers;

I am interested in the Systematics of Freshwater Amphipods of Turkey. 
I have some Amphipod samples from different parts of 
Turkey(Especially from west and south parts). But I 
haven't got latest identification key(s) about them. For example, there is a 
Stygobromus sample, but I can't determine it.

Could anybody help me to solve this problem out there?

Subject: CRUST-L: ICC-4 registration

Where do we register?!!?

A good question, and one that is answered in an information  packet the
university congress bureau is supposed to be sending out to all
participants as their registration forms are processed.  These seem to be
going astray.

Registration will begin on Sunday afternoon, 19 July, in the main
university auditorium.  This is in the "Oude Lutherskerk" -- the Old
Lutheran Church.  This is located on a tree lined plein, or square, called
"Spui" in the heart of the old city about 1/2 kilometer south of the Royal
Palace, on the Dam.  The church lies on Spui, faces the large canal called
"Singel," and is situated right next to the central library of the
university.

Registration will be between 4 and 6 on Sunday afternoon, and from 6 to 8
there will be a welcome reception for all congress particpants in the
registration area.  Registration will continue Monday morning from 8 to 9
at the same place, the Old Lutheran Church, wherein the first plenary
session of the congress will begin at 9:00.

If you are taking trams 4, 9, 16, 24, or 25 you get off at the stop called
"Spui" right next to the statue of Queen Wilhemina and walk two blocks
west.  If you take trams 1, 2, or 5 you get off at another stop also called
"Spui," and you are right in the middle of the actual plein.

Hopefully all will be less confusing once you arrive if you remember to
look at any city map (they are all over the city) and go to the corner of
Spui and Singel.  The church is within easy walking distance of probably
most, if not all, hotels that are being used by the Carlson WagonLit people
for congress participants.

Dear Crustlers!
Does anybody know something about assimilation effieciencies of fiddler
crabs??? I calculated the annual food requirements of them (which are very,
very high). That means I know something about how much is going through their
guts. What I do not know is the concentration of organic material in the
material they actually ingest. I'm looking for information on the
concentration factor (organic concentration in the ingested material divided
by the concentration in the sediment) or something like that. In the end I
want to calculate the consumption in terms of energy (Calories) therefore I
need an estimate of the organic material ingested...
Does anybody has an idea????

Regards

Volker

Subject: CRUST-L: Stress indicators in crustaceans

Dear Crust-lers:

Could anybody tell me if there is a reliable and measurable indicator of
stress in crustaceans (shrimp in particular)?

A widely accepted measure of stress in fish is cortisol.  Generally plasma
cortisol  levels in captive fish range from 5 - 100 ng/ml, the level of
non-stressed fish being below 10 ng/ml.  Is there a similar indicator in
crustacean hemolymph?

I have run a couple of preliminary literature searches without much success,
and given that I am overseas right now (Panama), I have not been able to
search the major databases.

Thanks in advance for any information you could provide to me on this matter.

Best regards,

Ernesto J. Quintero

I would like some advice on casting small burrows.  I need to document the
burrows of small lysiosquilloid stomatopods.   Most of the burrows will be
u-shaped in sand and will range from very small (2 mm in diameter and 15 cm
deep to larger burrows 1 cm in diameter, 50 cm deep with the two entrances
about 30 cm apart.  The burrows are typically lined with a mucus/sand
mixture that is fairly tough.  Most of the work will have to be done
underwater, although at extreme low tides  the top few centimeters of the
burrows will be above the waterline.   Ambient temperature will be around
23 C.  If you could provide me with specific resins (brand names) that you
have used and any tricks that can force the resin throughout the burrow
system, I would very much appreciate it.  Thanks.

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: Casting crustacean burrows

Roy,

You mention resins-do you need plastic in particular? If so, stop by the EM
facility, and see what they're using for corrosion-casting. Probably
Mercox, or a similar methylmethacrylate. This can be expensive, but the
methacrylates are water-compatible (glycolmethacrylate is the other popular
one). Mercox is more expensive than just buying methymethacrylate from
Sigma or Fisher, etc.

Methylmethacrylate has a viscosity near that of water, and so is excellent
for getting into fine tubes, crevices, etc., and will preserve the fine
features of the burrow wall (and maybe critters) that you didn't know you
wanted. 8-)

I've used silicon bathtub chalk to fill the lateral lines of fish, and see
no reason why that won't work for burrows. The chalk can do a good job of
retaining fine features-it showed the lateral line end-organs very nicely.
This comes as white or black (maybe, I've only used white).

Latex used for filling blood vessels would also work.

Latex and chalk obviously won't set up hard like the methacrylates do, so
they'll be flexible. This may or may not be important. They will be prone
to tearing.

The acrylates and latex can be colored. Mercox comes as a kit for corrosion
casting with a pigment and catalyst. Any acrylate will usually need a
catalyst-they'll polymerize without it, but will set much quicker with the
catalyst (often this is benzoyl peroxide, so your burrows will have nice
complexions). If you get generic methacrylate, and the supply house doesn't
have a pigment available, try mixing in any stain as powder into a small
batch of uncatalyzed resin. Mix this into the resin for casting. I suspect
food-coloring might even work.

Methacrylates can be bought from EM supply houses and other chemical
suppliers. The latex? Um...Ward's maybe or Carolina Biological? Maybe
Fisher or Sigma, I don't know.

You could also buy low-viscosity 2-component epoxies at a hardware store,
but these likely won't be cheaper, and are entertaining to mix in the
field.

Whatever you use, try making a nozzle with a large-bore hypodermic syringe
needle ground flat or otherwise blunted. Put on a 60mL disposable syringe
(directly or using a short length of tubing). Fill the syringe, insert the
plunger and have fun scaring the beegeezus out of hapless stomatopods.

Subject: CRUST-L: Pontogeneiidae or Eusiridae?

Hello all,
	This one is for the amphipod taxonomists or those who have
experience with some of their troublesome families.  Bousfield (1973) 
recognizes the Pontogeneidae as a separate family from the Eusiridae.  In
a more recent revision, Bousfield and Hendrycks (1995)  revise the
eusiridae in the north Pacific.  Although I have only read the abstract,
they seem to maintain the Eusiridae (e.g., Eusirus, Rhachotropis,
Eusirella, Cleonardo) as a different family from the Pontogeneidae.  In
contrast, Bousfield and Karaman (1991) include not only the Pontogeneiidae
(e.g., Pontogeneia, Tethygeneia), but also the Calliopiidae (e.g.,
Calliopius, Apherusa) as genera within the Eusiridae. I would like to know
whether any concensus has been reached.  I was surprised to see that, in
spite of all the problems Barnard and Karaman discuss, there was not even
an attempt to erect subfamilies.  From my understanding of their ecology,
I would not be surprised if these are actually different amphipod
families. However, ecological remarks can be deceitful when it comes to
taxonomic relations.  Can I get a vote on this one?
Afectuosamente,

Dear crusters,

to compare with the description of that species made by F. A. Chace in
1940. For that I greatly appreciate if someone can find me a copy of:

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: Casting crustacean burrows

Roy,
I've used fiberglass boat resin (Bondo) from the hardware store for Uca 
burrows.  I mix in at most half the hardener stated in the directions 
else the stuff sets too quickly.  I like Phil's suggestion of a syringe, 
but you may have trouble with melting plastics.  Nonetheless it's worth 
a try.  Don't know about submerged use of the resin.  It's also 
relatively cheap ($15-20 per half gal).  

Phil's comments on the corrosion casting methods sound interesting.  The 
methacrylates are probably better choices than the fiberglass resins.

Cheers, Jeff

Subject: CRUST-L: where can we study Aratus pisoni ?

Dear friends,

a student of mine wish to study the behaviour, in field, of the
tree-climbing crab, Aratus pisoni. Around December-January, my student, Ms
Elena Foschi, will be able to reach any of the countries where mangroves
hosting A. pisoni can be found. She is quite able to speak Spanish, French
and English (this is also her capability hierarchy) and has a quite good
experience of travelling and adaptation. 

The things the young lady is looking for are:  1) a biological station
where she could settle for at least a lunar month for a reasonable price
and 2) a biological station very close to the mangroves since a lot of
continuous recording will be needed, at day and night time, at low and high
tide, etc. "Very close" should thus mean no need of transport and a quite
safe place too.

Pattern of periodic migration and orientation mechanisms are our main field
of interest. Any collaboration with any student or researcher will
obviously be more than welcome.

Many thanks in advance,


Marco Vannini

Dear Crustacea Listserv,

	Can anyone provide some taxonomic advice in determining the
species within the genus Tmetonyx?  We have trapped some specimens out on
Georges Bank and are having trouble discriminating between Tmetonyx
similis and Tmetonyx cicada.  We have been using the number of pairs of
dorsal denticles on the telson to tell the two species apart but are not
sure whether this is the best way to go.  Any suggestions of good keys or
further insight would be much appreciated.

Thanks in advance,
Jay

Subject: CRUST-L: Estimation of molt stage duration

Hello!

I am currently working on a project where I am describing and estimating 
the duration of individual molt stages of premolt development (using 
Drach and Tchernigovtzeff's technique) in adult Dungeness crabs (Cancer 
magister).  A majority of studies have focused on determining molt stage 
duration by "multiple staging" of a crustacean, but much of the work 
done appears to be over 10 yrs old.  Does anyone know of any current 
work being done on this subject?  

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Todd Miller

Dear Cruster, 

Could anybody tell me whether Callianassa subterrania is synonym of C.
tyrrhena or these species are different species ?

Ingle (1997) said "the taxonomic status of some native species of mud
lobsters is currently being revised" in his book.  And he described C.
tyrrhena instead of C. subterranea.  However Astall et al. (1997) used C.
subterranea as material of their study.  Are these mud lobsters different
species ?

Hi All,

I am looking at condition indices in Southern Rock Lobsters(_Jasus
edwardsii_).  While prediction of protein content/muscle mass from serum
protein is fairly straightforward, the hurdle appears to be assessment of
where these lobsters are in C4, given that it is by far the longest stage
(5-9 months). Postmoult, the approach to premoult and premoult itself are no
problem.

>From what I have seen in the literature, most hormones associated with the
moult cycle appear to be appear to be at significant levels in
premoult/postmoult, so are of little use here. I would appreciate any
ideas/insight anybody could offer here.

Thanks,

Cheers,

Richard

     Dear Jay,
     
     From your email it sounds like you are getting two kinds of Tmetonyx.
     
     I am in the process of studying a large collection of lysianassoid 
     amphipods from Iceland. I get a lot of specimens of what I am calling 
     Tmetonyx cicada. It definetely has a more apically rounded lateral 
     lateral cephalic lobe than the picture Sars shows of T. similis where 
     the lobe appears to be apically acute. This should be a good way to 
     quickly tell the species apart. Also it looks to me like the 
     posteroventral spine on epimeral plate 3 is better developed in T. 
     similis. You could try to corrolate the head character with the number 
     of robust setae on the telson - might work.
     
     Good luck
     
     Jim Lowry

Dear Crustacea Listserv,
     
        Can anyone provide some taxonomic advice in determining the
species within the genus Tmetonyx?  We have trapped some specimens out on 
Georges Bank and are having trouble discriminating between Tmetonyx 
similis and Tmetonyx cicada.  We have been using the number of pairs of 
dorsal denticles on the telson to tell the two species apart but are not 
sure whether this is the best way to go.  Any suggestions of good keys or 
further insight would be much appreciated.
     
Thanks in advance,
Jay

     Jay,
     
     One other character you might try is the posteroventral lobe of coxa 
     4. In T. cicada it is narrowly rounded, but according to the picture 
     of Sars it is a broad lobe with a straight posterior margin. If this 
     character is good it should be an easy way to separate the specis.

CRUSTers,

If you've been experiencing problems with CRUST-L, read on, else delete.

(1) Some list members have noticed that I've been forwarding their messages 
to the list.  The messages are bouncing to me.  Bounces typically occur 
when YOUR system administrator makes subtle changes/improvements to your 
servers.  These changes affect the domain name of your address; hence your 
subscription isn't recognized by OUR software.  [Oh, the logic of computers!]
I've set a switch in the software to recognize only domain names, but it 
doesn't always comply.  If you experience this problem, unsubscribe and 
resubscribe using the instructions below.

(2) I've had to delete a few addresses due to excessive bounces, or 
unknown user errors.  I can't tolerate numerous repeated bounce messages 
every day.  If you don't receive CRUST-L mail for at least a week, then 
you were probably deleted.  Try contacting me first, or resubscribing to 
the list as per instructed below.  So far this has only happened to 3-4 
users, but I typically remove 5-10 old addresses every 2-3 weeks (usually 
from old student accounts or those who forget to unsubscribe).  I archive 
the list mail, so if you miss a week or so of mail, let me know.

(3) If you post to the list and receive a bounce message (as in "your 
message to xyz@abc.edu was not received"), just delete it.  It's an address 
that isn't responding at the time of the mailing.  If your bounce 
message says it bounced from CRUST-L, then you need to resend.  Wait at 
least a few hours before resending and only resend once so as not to 
send repeated messages to the list.

(4) You can subscribe in a DIGEST mode and receive a compilation of 40Kb 
of list traffic every week or so.  This is useful if you're going on 
vacation.

(5) If you have any questions or problems re the administration of the list, 
please address them to me, jeff@vims.edu.

I've enjoyed the posts,

Jeffrey Shields

Dear Crusties,
I am trying to find references or work done on nitrogenous production
by lobster (Homarus americanus), and various commercial species of
crab.  I'm interested in comparing production rates.  Do you all have
any suggestions? This must have been thoroughly researched, but I'm
not familiar with it.  Thanks in advance for your help.

Rich,
There is an extensive body of literature on nitrogen metabolism and
excretion in crustaceans, though I don't know of any studies specifically
on lobsters.  Numerous reviews have been published over the past 10 years.
You might check out the following:

Kormanik, G.A. and J.N. Cameron (1981) Ammonia excretion in animals that
breathe water: A review. Marine Biology Letters 2: 11-23.


Claybrook, D.L. (1983) Nitrogen metabolism.  Chapter 3 in Biology of
Crustacea, vol. 5 (L Mantel, ed),Academic Press

Henry, R.P. (1995) Nitrogen metabolism and excretion for cell volume
regulation in invertebrates.  Chapter 4 in Nitrogen Metabolism and
Excretion (P. Walsh and P. Wright, eds), CRC Press.

O'Donnell, M.J. and J.C. Wright (1995) Nitrogen excretion in terrestrial
crustaceans.  Chapter 7 in Nitrogen Metabolism and Excretion (P. Walsh and
P. Wright, eds), CRC Press.

Subject: CRUST-L: eggs (?) on freshwater crayfish gills

Can anyone tell me if the ectocommensal flatworm Temnocephala 
novaezealandicus lays its eggs on the gill filaments of Paranephrops 
crayfish, or just on the exoskeleton? Any other suggestions as to 
what may cement capsules of 
eggs to freshwater crayfish gills?

Subject: CRUST-L: abnormal blue crab

Dear Crust-L'ers,
I just received a shipment of blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) from
Florida, and one female (carapace width about 6 cm, so I am guessing she is
sexually immature) has a brownish inflated sac protruding from her abdomen.
Can anyone tell me what this might be? If it is a parasite, is it likely to
infect other crabs in the tank?
Thanks,
Chuck Booth

Dear Chuck, 

it is probably a "sacculina externa", the external manifestation of a
rhizocephalean cirriped parasiting brachyurans.

Subject: Shrimp farming info request.
e-mail tisco@ibm.ve.cnr.it

Dear Crust-L'ers,

can anybody help me in solving the following problem ?
We are growing shrimps (Penaeus japonicus) in two ponds of about 9 ha each.
Both ponds were originally very well prepaered: they appeared coloured and
turbidity was easily mantained at about 30-35 cm (Disco secchi).
During the farming cicle, due to lowering DO values, we had to force a
little bit the water exchanges.
At that point we registered lower turbidities and quickly fertilized with
urea and triple perfosfate (0,83 kg N + 0,08 kg P per ha every 2-3 days).
Pond n0 2 is O.K., but we could not recover pond n0 1, despite our efforts
to fertilize more and more times. Pond n0 1 is now full of macroalgae.
What can we do ?
Just contiunue to fertilize or there is something more useful ?
Thank you so much.

Subject: CRUST-L: blue crab infected with rhizocephalan barnacle 

Thanks to all who offered their expert opinion in diagnosing my blue crab's
condition (consensus is Loxothylacus texanus); she is now preserved for use
in our parasitology course.  Jeff Shields suggested that I routinely check
the crabs I use in my physiology exp'ts for such parasites.  I am afraid
that parasites are something many physiologists (esp. those who never had a
parasitology course) working on wild animals try not to think too much
about (if the animal seems to be healthy and survives long enough to
provide data, the experiment is a success).  The problem is, if one does
look for parasites almost certainly some will be found, and it is then
difficult to know how, or if, this should be factored in (or out) when
interpreting the data. I suspect a lot of classical physiology and
biochemstry was performed on animals with parasites (not to mention other
ailments), and this accounts for at least some of the variation in results
among studies.

Dear Chuck

Its true that many physiologists do not look too carefully for parasites
when selecting animals for experiments etc.
However, with rhizocephalans you have a really bad situation. These
parasites completely takes over control of the host which is in effect
rendered as nothing as a robot. Paraphrasing one of my colleagues
Rhizocephalans are to all effects a parasite genotype within a host
phenotype.
The parasites:
Feminize males in terms of morphology, physiology, and behaviour
Sterilizes males and females
Arrests the moult cycle in many host parasite combinations (but NOT in
all)
Affects the growth of the host either negatively or positively
Manipulates the host into "believing" that the external parasite is the
host's own offspring, which is then cared for with the normal brood
caring behaviour including grooming, abdominal flapping, and assisting
the parasite larvae in escaping at hatch time.

I am sure very peculiar results can result if you consider such a beast
as a normal crab.
Add to this that many of these effects are OPERATIVE soon after
infection of the host and much BEFORE the parasite emerges on the
surface of the host!
AND that in many populations the prevalence of crab infesting
rhizocephala can be high (in some places reaching 100%).

..but now I have scared you away from your work. That certainly was not
my intention.

Jens HOEG

Subject: RE: CRUST-L: blue crab infected with rhizocephalan barnacle 

Chuck, Jens, Crusters,

I should have added a caveat or two to my post on parasites and
physiological impacts on the host.  In many cases parasites can be benign,
especially larval forms in intermediate hosts (but even these have many
exceptions such as trematodes in molluscs).  It's just that there are many
cases like the rhizocephalan that have major impacts on host physiology, or
behavior, even before the infection is patent or observable without
damaging the host.  I guess the upshot is that sample sizes need to be
reasonable to pick up outliers, and outliers need to be examined for disease.

Regards behavior: In at least three cases I've seen sacculinized males
(with sacculina interna, i.e., the parasite not observable, but the crabs
showing signs of feminization) in precopulatory embraces with uninfected
males.  Now wouldn't that be a psychologist's dream come true?!

Cheers, Jeff

Subject: CRUST-L: parasites and physiology

In my own field of (respiratory/circulatory/acid-base/ionoregulatory)
physiology, I am aware of very few studies of parasite effects on host
physiology (Andy Gannon's work on gill ectoparasite effects on blue crabs
and Lou Burnett's work on Perkinsus infections in oysters are among those
few).  There is no question but that adding parasites in a controlled
fashion to a physiology study increases the complexity of the study
many-fold, and this no doubt deters many investigators who recognize the
need for these very types of studies. [I will confess to another
'shortcoming' of many physiology studies (and, by extension, the
physiologists who conduct them): we tend to focus on physiological
processes and responses to, say, exercise, or environmental changes, but
ignore the behavioral or ecological implications of those responses. For
example, the physiology literataure is loaded with studies looking at the
effects of hypoxia on acid-base balance in crabs, but almost no one ever
bothers to consider, let alone experimentally test, if this internal
disturbance is really important to the animal's ability to forage, mate,
etc.  We take it for granted that everyone recognizes that internal
homeostasis is vital for the animal, but never bother to verify how vital
it really is.]
In this regard, vertebrate physiological ecologists are considerably ahead
of us invert-ophiles, largely, I think, because a number of vertebrate
animal 'models' are rather easier to work with (it is far easier to
quantify locomotor performance (and its impairment) in lizards and fish
than in crabs.  Even so, I am quite sure that the thought of working with
wild animals harboring untold numbers of parasites and/or other
difficult-to-diagnose diseases has driven many a physiologist to work with
laboratory strains of mice and rats in order to eliminate as much of the
uncertainty as possible.
In summary, I would urge those of you who work with parasites to consider
reaching out to your physiologist (and ecologist) colleagues and offering
to undertake collaborative studies looking at the effects of parasites on
animal physiology, behavior, and performance.
Sorry to ramble on this way!

Greetings to all,

I am interested in contacting anyone who has captive husbandry
experience with Bathynomus sp., in particular the gian isopod,
Bathynomus giganteus.  I presently maintain a group of 9.0.0 B.
giganteus in one of my exhibits.  I am approaching a year on most of
these animals.  If anyone has had similar experiences or is intersted in
my experiences, please contact me directly at ehovland@flaquarium.org
and we'll swap tales...or is that pleotelsons?

Subject: CRUST-L: Effects of parasites and commensals on crustaceans.


Sorry to be late adding to this thread.  As Chuck pointed out, we 
physiologists don't often think about the effects of symbionts on our data, 
but at their least intrusive, symbionts increase variance.  A case in point: 
 I found that blue crabs that were infested with the gill barnacle, 
Octolasmis muelleri, hyperventilated at rest.  In Chuck's very thorough 
 work on exercise in blue crabs, he found resting ventilation values about 
halfway between my uninfested crabs' and my infested crabs' ventilation 
rates.  Since I found a 40% infestation rate from a population of crabs that 
I believe were not too far from where Chuck got his samples, it makes sense 
that 40% of his crabs would have been infested and slightly hyperventilating 
at rest.  This would have added to the variance in his data, which was 
greater than in my data set.

Hi,

I would like to know if somedody would be interested in studying
parasitism of spiny lobster puerulus. The species is Panulirus argus,
and it is just one of my project for the next year, but I feel there is

I can follow several discussion about parasitism, so I am nearly sure I

There hasn't been much done on the diseases of crustacean larvae, let alone
lobsters.  Trematode metacercariae, fungal (Lagenidium) and bacterial
infections, and possibly ellobiopsid (but only one record) infections have
been reported from larval crustaceans.  Fisher and Talbot have done some
nice work on bacterial and fungal infections in eggs.  Other possibilities
include nematode and cestode larvae, and various members of the fouling
community (ciliates, etc.).

Subject: CRUST-L: Haemolymph amino acids.

Hello,

I am running HPLC on haemolymph of Nephrops. I am trying to establish a
normal range of values for OPT-derivatized amino acids (i.e not including
Proline etc). I am obtaining values which I think are rather high when
compared to other studies (e.g Glycine @ 8.99uM ml-1,  Asparagine @ 3.86uM
ml-1,  Serine @ 8.72uM ml-1 etc).  Does anyone know of any reference data
for AA values in deproteinised Crustacean serum that I could use to see if
I am on the right track 

Cheers

Extensive Reference Library For Sale:
Marine Science, Environmental, and Taxonomic

If you or your laboratory is interested in obtaining this vital and important collection, pease contact Bill Boothe at (941)955-1438, NaturalEnquirer@mailexcite.com, or write to: Natural Encounters, P. O. Box 49274, Sarasota, FL 34230.

This very sizeable comprehensive reference library is comprised of well over 8,000 reprints, books, governmental publications, specializing in the taxonomy and systematics of all major invertebrate groups of the southeastern United States, Caribbean, and Gulf of Mexico fauna. Over 5,000 separate publications of major authors concerned with Crustacea (shrimp, crabs, mysids, isopods, and arthropods), Tunicates, Mollusks, Echinoderms, Polychaetes, Sponges, and Hydroids. The other 3,000 plus publications are concerned with bioassay and toxicology, environmental physiology, fish taxonomy and physiology, marine ecology, and reef biology and ecology.

A majority of these are original papers, many of which are pre-1950. Some major works date from the late 1800's and early 1900's. Documents include hundreds of Smithsonian Bulletins and Proceedings, American Museum of Natural History notes, Allan Hancock expedition reports, Fish and Wildlife Biological Survey Reports, and various state governmental publications.

Some are photocopies of older major works and manuscripts that were used to make invertebrate identifications. All papers are indexed on 3 x 5 index cards and are catalogued, numbered, and arranged by both group and author.

The quantity of Crustacean literature (shrimps, crabs, mysids, amphipods) is extensive and is taxonomically arranged by family and author in separate folders. (10+ boxes).

In addition to the 8,000 papers are numerous journals and reports: American Society of Zoologists, Bulletin of Marine Sciences (1951-1975), Copeia, Journal of Crustacean Biology, Biological Society of Washington, BLM reports of the southeast and Gulf of Mexico, Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology, and OBS/FWS reports. Many are compete series from 1971 till the late 1980's. Also included are books and other publications by Rathbun, Richardson, van Name, Dall, Cushman, Nutting, Wilson, Barnard, Fraser, Manning, Williams, and Bayer, just to name a few.

Because this library is so extensive, I would prefer to sell this as one complete library, but offers for portions of the collection will be considered.  There are over fifty boxes of material, each box weighing 20-40 pounds.

Dear Billy,

Having just moved to the southeastern US, as a crustacean systematist
teaching environmental biology, I find this reference collection quite
intriguing. I guess the two obvious questions are: 1) what is the asking
price, and 2) is there any way to get a clearer idea of just what is
available?

Subject: CRUST-L: Precocious ovarian maturation of crab

Dear All,

Normally, the Chinese freshwater crab Eriocheir sinensis mature in the
second
year. However, with the development of crab farming, most of the crabs
mature
in the first year. The matured crabs only have a body weight of 30-50
grams,
which is much less than the market weight. Some scientists in China
indicate
that the reasons are higher temperature, good feeds, higher density,
etc.  We
want to know what are the real or main reasons of precocious ovarian
maturation of crab? And how to prevent this phenomenon? Any information
and
literatures are very much appreciated.

Liu Fenqui:

I have nothing to share about crabs, but there is an analagous early
maturation phenomenon in crayfish that can be reduced by increased
feed and decreased density (Romaire et al., 1979. Growth and survival
of stunted red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) in a
feeding-stocking density experiment in Pools.  Fresh Water Crayfish
4:331-336.  

Stunting is also seen in the other crayfish (Huner and Lindqvist, 1986.  A
stunted crayfish (Astacus astacus) population in central Finland. 
Freshwater Crayfish 6:156-165, and may occurr when larger crayfish
apparently inhibit subordinates growth.  It is related to poor water quality
(Curtis and Jones, 1995. overview of of redclaw crayfish (Cherax
quadricarinatus, farming practices in northern Australia.  Freshwater
Crayfish 10:456-468.


There is some evidence that there is a minimum number of molts to
maturity in P. clarkii.  If they mature at the minimum number of molts they
are stunted, conversely, if they molt more than the minimum number of
times they are larger and more marketable.  Aquaculturists are managing
crayfish farms to produce larger crayfish by manipulating population
density and food.    

I suspect that the early molt to maturity in crayfish is an adaptation that
increases the chance of reproduction in an environment that is subject to
rapid change.  Perhaps you crabs are maturing early because of poor
water quality, a high population density (social inhibition?) or sub-optimal
feeding.

Good luck.

Dave O'Neill.

IXth International Meeting on the Amphipoda (Amphipod Chatshop) Kronenburg
(Germany) 26-30 July 1998

Wim Vader,  Adam Baldinger & Traudl Krapp-Schickel

This amphipod meeting directly followed the IVth International Crustacean
Congress in Amsterdam. The small village of Kronenburg in the Eifel
mountains of W. Germany formed a nice contrast to Amsterdam, where most
participants had been the week prior. Thirty-five scientists from twelve
countries on four continents took part in the amphipod meetings, some
accompanied by their families whose presence increased the family
atmosphere even more.  The Amphipod Chatshop, was organized by Traudl Krapp
Schickel (Bonn) and Wim Vader (Troms=F8). The unpretentious title chatshop
was chosen because no official lectures or contributed papers were given,
instead the meeting concentrated on a series of moderated discussions on
topics of common interest.

The discussions held were as follows:

27 July morning: "Cladistic tools in amphipod taxonomy," moderated by
J=F8rgen Berge (Troms=F8). Cladistic analyses are rapidly becoming a vital p=
art
in amphipod taxonomy, but many workers are still unfamiliar with the theory
and methods of this discipline. Berge introduced this topic based upon his
own studies. This resulted in a lively discussion, that included the
peculiar problems posed by the mosaic-like evolution of the Amphipoda,
coupled to their almost total absence from the fossil record.  Virtually no
agreement on what constitutes apomorphic characters impedes the search for
suitable outgroups.  Numerous ingroup taxa and only a few representative
outgroup taxa, results in analyses that may become skewed, because the many
closely related ingroup-taxa more or less swamp the character traits in the
few outgroup taxa. The role of molecular studies and how to integrate such
results into cladistic analyses currently generated mostly by morphological
characters was also discussed.

27 July afternoon: "What should a taxonomic description look like?"
moderated by Oliver Coleman (Berlin).  Several years ago, Olli distributed
a circular letter with the same title, asking for as complete illustrations
as possible, and suggesting that written text concentrate on points
insufficient for illustration.  He maintained that "it is easier to
understand a illustration than to visualize a written description."  There
was general agreement on the importance of complete and detailed
illustrations, but many colleagues also stressed the significance of
written descriptions, particularly to explain species variation.
     A researcher should discern between publications that involve new
species descriptions and/or generic or family level revisions from the
taxonomic keys produced for the general biologist or ecologists.  Both
types are of vital importance, but it was agreed upon that these
publications can not easily be combined in one paper.

28 July morning. "Amphipod information in an electronic age," moderated by
Alan Myers (Cork).  A number of possibilities to distribute electronic
information was discussed and included i.e: the development of an amphipod
website, that could serve as a gateway for the Amphipod Newsletter, now
temporarily stalled; deposition of and easy access to regional taxa and
their distribution lists; type specimens and their museum location; and
illustrated interactive keys (hopefully in DELTA-format).
     A sizable number of technical problems and pitfalls was noted:  Such a
website requires constant service by an expert, a significant amount of
time for a dedicated and altruistic researcher (several younger colleagues
were named) and it will require resources.  A problem with an easily
accessible list is quality control, i.e: who decides which entries are
reliable, and will monitor and edit the taxonomic and distributional data?
     Stefan Koenemann (Norfolk, VA) promised to develop an amphipod
homepage. Les Watling will scan Amphipod Newsletters 2-20 and Wim Vader has
produced AN 21; all should be available soon to download on the web page.

28 July afternoon. "Whither amphipod family-level taxonomy?" This
discussion was introduced by Les Watling (Maine), who gave his views on the
plesiomorphic amphipod and on the position of the Amphipoda among the
Peracarida. Currently the classification of the Amphipoda is still in a
state of flux; the schedules of Jerry Barnard and Ed Bousfield, often not
very compatible and neither of them based on cladistic analyses, are still
prevalent.  Discussions revolved around the bush-like evolution of the
Amphipoda and envious comparisons to the Isopoda where the general
classification appears clearer.  Not unexpectedly, the classification
problems of the Amphipoda were not solved!  However, it was suggested that
a cladistic analysis of the amphipod families should have high priority,
simply to give a general idea of the overall relationships, and to generate
topics for further studies.

29 July morning. "Uniformity of terminology," moderated by Oliver Coleman.
The primary question of this session was whether this discussion is
necessary at all in such that "we should not try to stifle colleagues by
forcing everybody to use exactly the same terminology," a thesis forcefully
defended. However, descriptions should be unequivocal and unambiguous.  As
an example, the terminology of setae, spines and teeth was discussed.  Les
Watling announced that a workshop on this topic will be held in Maine in
the summer of 1999.

29 July afternoon. "Illustrations in taxonomic descriptions." This
discussion was based on a note contribute by Kathy Conlan and Ed Hendrycks
(Ottawa), with examples of good and poor illustrations, and a set of
guidelines that illustrations should adhere to. These guidelines were
generally accepted as important, although it was pointed out that they were
a bit "idealistic" and difficult to adhere to with increasing publication
costs.  Among the points mentioned often inadequately defined in present
illustrations (and descriptions!) were the pleopods, the oostegites (form
and number), and the characteristics of immature and juvenile animals.

"Next amphipod meeting: when and where?" moderated by Wim Vader (Troms=F8).
The next International Crustacean Congress will be held in Melbourne in
2001, and many participants voted for an amphipod meeting or an
amphipod-isopod consortium prior to or after the Congress (Tasmania and
Sydney were mentioned). The next European Crustacean Conference will be in
Lodz, Poland in 2002.
     Most of the participants expressed interest in having an amphipod
meeting prior to the Melbourne Congress.  Wanda Plaitis (Kreta) offered a
preliminary invitation to hold the next amphipod meeting on Kreta in the
summer of 1999.  It was decided to have next amphipod meeting in 1999 and
it should be in a regular format with contributed papers and invited
lectures and posters.  Wanda Plaitis, Wim Vader and Adam Baldinger are in
the process of developing this proposal (PLEASE SEE BELOW).
     In addition to the "chatshops," ICC contributed posters were arranged
at the Eifelhaus, and magnificent photographs of Antarctic and Lake Baikal
amphipods were shown by Gauthier Chapelle (Brussel).  Also shown was a
fascinating video on the biology of some amphipod species contributed by
Les Watling.  Ichiro Takeuchi (Japan) showed photographs from his Antarctic
diving exploits.  An evaluation of the chatshop format showed that most
participants were satisfied with this informal meeting, especially when it
is held directly following a large conference.

Subject: CRUST-L: Coloured Shrimps

Dear Crusters,

We are currently doing a study on electric fisheries of brown shrimp =
(Crangon crangon). The animals are filmed and then the film frames are =
studied to find out
how high the shrimps jumped. To mimic real environment, the shrimps =
should be filmed in the dark (or with red light or maybe with UV light).
Has anyone got experience with staining life shrimp for filming under =
such conditions? Can we e.g. use a fluorescent dye? The shrimps should of=
 course not be
influenced by the dye for the duration of the experiment (couple of =
hours). If so could you tell us wich dye/light to use?

thanks

H. Hillewaert, K.Ghesquiere & H. Polet

Hi Crusters,

We are currently doing a project on electric fishery on Crangon crangon.
Could anybody give us some information about the physiology of locomotion=
 in shrimps (or Decapoda in general).
We are particularly looking at the effects of electricity on the tail =
muscles.
References to books or publications would be great!
Thanks,

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: Coloured Shrimps

Have you already looked at the shrimp under UV light? Arthropod cuticle is
autofluorescent, although dimly in most critters. Some, like scorpions,
fluoresce brightly. Maybe your shrimp do also.

Dear Hans & al.

* Here are some references related to the above question. Let me take this
opportunity to present some thoughts :

* While perfectioning again and again the fishing gears, the stocks of
valuable sea-food will be depleted if nobody takes care of preservation of
stocks. Overfishing is there in many places. This is well known now. 

* Another lesser known aspect of intensive fishing. In Amsterdam congress,
I was very interested in the presentation of Glen Jamieson entitled
"Selective effects of fishing on the population dynamics of Crustacean",
explaining the inadvertent genetic selection for ealier sexual maturity and
smaller adult size. We, scientists, have also to explain the dangers of
such a situatiuon and to help to find solutions for this problem. Do you
like prawn sized lobsters? shrimp sized prawns? and copepod sized shrimps?
I prefer full sized specimens !
No Future ? Which Future ?

Anyway, here are the references I can provide on the subject, associating
the keywords Crangon-Decapoda/locomotion/electric fishing.

Cheers. Pierre.

Subject: CRUST-L: New Amphipod homepage

To all 'amphipod' colleagues:

Our new web project, a central web site about amphipod related 
research, is now accessible at:  

http://www.odu.edu/~jrh100f/amphome 

It is a first draft, or "AH 1.0, Light Edition", if you want 
(e.g., the page hit counter still needs to be activated - I am 
working on it). I called it The Amphipod Homepage and added some 
links we already had on our departmental sites. I think it is a good 
idea to provide each link with a short summary which would facilitate 
the search for specific information. So, if you send me the URLs of 
your web sites, please add some comments or a brief introduction that 
describes your site best (see, for example, The subterranean Amphipod 
Database on our new Amphipod Homepage).

Any comments, suggestions, or ideas about additional topics or 
structural changes are welcome! 

Thanks a lot,

                SHOALS OF CAPRICORN PROGRAMME

The Shoals of Capricorn Programme is a major marine science research and
education programme initiated by the Royal Geographical Society (with The
Institute of British Geographers) in association with the Royal Society
and the governments of Seychelles and Mauritius. This Programme will
investigate the massive submerged Mascarene Plateau, lying between
Seychelles and Mauritius, forming part of the western Indian Ocean Large
Marine Ecosystem. 

The programme will serve as a platform supplying facilities and local
expertise to visiting scientists.  For further information please see:

Dear Crust-Ls,
                              I am working on molecular phylogenetics of
the euphausiaceae (krill).  If any of you have ethanol-preserved (but not
formalin-fixed) krill that I could have, I'd be very grateful for the
chance to include them in my analysis.
  If anyone had a sample of Amphionides reynaudii, that would be useful for
higher-level phylogenetics too.

Thanks in advance,
Simon

Subject: CRUST-L: planktonic crustacean keys

Fellow crustacean enthusiasts: Lisa-ann Gershwin of the University of 
California, Berkeley and Gary Williams of the California Academy of 
Sciences have put together a proposal for a book on the planktonic and 
midwater fauna of California. Various interested biologists have put 
together brief manuscripts, keys or abstracts for chapters and sections 
on various groups. The University of California Press has shown serious 
interest in the proposal.  However, nobody has shown any interest in 
writing a section on any of the following groups: copepods, mysidaceans, 
euphausiaceans, cladocerans, leptostracans or others (amphionids, 
parasitic isopods, or larvae).  If anyone would be interested in 
contributing a section for potential publication, please contact Lisa 
Gershwin (lgershwin@hotmail.com) or Gary Williams 
(gwilliams@calacademy.org).  Mary Wicksten, Texas A&M University

Subject: CRUST-L: tricks in Electronic Microscopy

Dear colleagues,
We are currently trying to perform semi-thin and ultra-thin sections of
deep sea ostracodes to get more insights into their respiratory adaptation
to this extreme environment.=20
To soften the shell, we tried EDTA 5% in the fixative but we have still
problems.=20
We are going to increase this percentage but I would like to ask if there
is anyone around who have (or who know somebody who have), experience in
this particular field.
Thanks a lot for any information.
Cheers, JC

Hello CRUST-Lers,

is there anybody out there who has ever heard of the following title:

MEEK, A. [Alexander?] (1903): Animal Types, the Norway Lobster, 
Nephrops norvegicus. Newcastle upon Tyne.

I would be very grateful to get some correct bibliographic data: 
Publisher? how many pages ? Is the title correct ? etc.
There must be some errors within this, because even the British 
Library never heard of it (?) :-(

Thanks in advance for any comments
All the best

Wulf

Subject: CRUST-L: activity in the field

Dear colleagues,
	I am looking for data on the ecology of crustacean in the field. I am
especially interested by the percentage of time animals are spending daily
for walking, looking after food, digesting quietly in a hole, resting and
dreaming, fighting, etc...
I guess the behavior is quite variable and different for interdidal animals
which are obliged to stay quiet at low tide during daytime and for those
who are living like lobsters at lower level, but any informations are=
 welcome.
	I think there are people around interested by these question in terms of
energy budget, but I am not introduce in that field. Any help is welcome !

	Best wishes from the sandy and sunny (today !) side of France ! JC

      Invertebrate Zoology, Natural Museum of Natural History

Dear Colleagues,
   On October 5, 1998, Dr. Fenner A. Chace,Jr., Zoologist Emeritus of
the Department of Invertebrate Zoology, National Museum of Natural
History, Smithsonian Institution, will celebrate his 90th birthday.
During that week we will honor him with a (surprise) party and are
therefore calling for letters of tribute, congratulations and good
wishes from friends, colleagues and associates; these will be gathered
and presented to him during this fete on Oct. 6.
   Dr. Chace received his A.B., A.M., and Ph.D. from Harvard University;
the latter was conferred in 1934. He began publishing on Crustacea in
1936. During his 62-year career he has enormously increased our
understanding of the shrimpsand lobsters of the world. After working at
the Museum of Comparative Zoology he came to the Smithsonian in 1946,
holding the title of Senior Zoologist from 1963 until his retirement in
1978. After retirement he continued to produce major monographs,
particularly on the shrimps of the U.S. Philippines Albatross
Expedition. At age 89, he published the last monograph in this series,
which now totals more than 900 pages. He still continues to work a few
days a week.
   We invite your contributions to help us celebrate this
milestone of one of the most important scientists in Carcinology of
this century. They may be sent to me at the following address:

Dr. Kristian Fauchald, Chairman
Dept. of Invertebrate Zoology
NHB 163
Smithsonian Institution
Washington, D. C. 20560-0163

Subject: type of Pleurophricus spinipes (BRACHYURA)

Dear colleagues:

I am trying to locate the type material of a palicid crab, Pleurophricus
spinipes De Man, 1888 (Archiv fur Naturgeschichte, 53: 215-600). It was
described by De Man from material collected by J. Brock in Indonesia. The
type could have been in either Leiden, Amsterdam or Frankfurt but none of
these museums has it.

Any hints?

Subject: CRUST-L: Scylla &...?

Dear Crusters,
I'm looking at the distribution, abundance, natural diet and reproductive
cycle of the Decapod Scylla serrata in  the mangroves swamps of 
South African estuaries.
During the dissections of almost all the crabs I noticed the 
presence of parasites in the gills chamber of the crabs. They look like the
following:
they have a sort of long "neck" ending with a large hook. In fact, they
look like small adult goose 
or stalked barnacles.
Does anybody have any kind of information on these crustaceans ? 
Are they real parassites?
Please send any information to: fran@dogmatix.utr.ac.za
Thank you for any help,
Francesca

Francesca,

Darryl Hudson & Bob (RJG) Lester published on the parasites from Scylla in 
_Aquaculture_ a couple of years ago.  Sorry I can't provide the 
reference. It's at work.  WIlliam Jeffries and his 
students/collaborators published extensively on "gooseneck" barnacles, 
Octolasmis spp., from a number of crustaceans.  He has at least 2 papers 
on the epibionts.  Tim Jones, Bob Lester and I did an unpublished study of 
the parasites of Scylla from around eastern Australia. 

If what you have is visible to the unclothed eye then you have a 
species of Octolasmis (see Jeffries et al.'s work).  If what you have is 
only visible with a microscope, then you could have a number of different 
ciliates (Epistylis, Operculariella, etc. - see Hudson & Lester).

I can provide references next week.

CHeers, Jeff

Dear colleagues,

can anybody suggest a good, exhaustive book or publication on taxonomy of
Penaeid shrimps ?
I am looking for something definitely scientific more than popular, defining
precise morphological attributes to differentiate different species of
Penaeid shrimps.
Thank you in advance for helping.

Dear Francesca

I, too, am interested in knowing more about the long neck-large hook
parasites you found in the Scylla serrata you dissected.  Jeffrey Shields
is perhaps correct in identifying it as Octolasmis. Ditto with Ian Knuckey.

I have a crab farm in the Philippines and this parasite seems to be present
in  crabs we procure from other places in the country.  We have observed
that a heavy presence of this parasite in the gills of the crab affects the
crab's activity.  This is followed closely by a substantial loss of
appetite and, from time to time, death of the crab if it fails to recover
from the onslaught.  Molting, too, seems to be affected.

If ever you get to know more about this parasite, I would be very happy if
you will share the info with me.

Perhaps some Cruster out there can advise how Octolasmis can be
controlled/minimized/eliminated.

Mabuhay, Antonio

Antonio,

Andrew Gannon will be forwarding observations on the physiological impact
of Octolasmis.  I've seen  gill deformities result from heavy infestations
in Portunus pelagicus. The gill deformities and physiological toll (i.e.,
heavy exercise-like effect) could work together to affect a crab's ability
to molt.

Antonio,
I found that Octolasmis muelleri had little measurable detrimental effect on 
host blue crabs, unless the infestation was massive.

	1992. Gannon A. T. and M. G. Wheatly.  The effects of ectocommensal gill 
barnacle (Octolasmis muelleri) infestation on blue crab (Callinectes sapidus 
Rathbun) respiration. Journal of Crustacean Biology. 12(1):11-18.

1995. A. T. Gannon and M. G. Wheatly.  Physiological effects of an 
ectocommensal gill barnacle (Octolasmis muelleri) on exercising and recovering 
blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus Rathbun). Marine Behaviour and Physiology. 
24:215-225.

The crabs best defense against the ectocommensals is to molt and the barnacles 
are shed with the the exoskeleton over the gills.  Crabs that had been 
parasitized by Rhizocephalan barnacles were prevented from molting by that 
internal parasite.  Many of them had massive infestations.  Perhaps you are 
seeing a similar phenomenon in your crabs that become moribund.  There would 
be a great deal of selection pressure on the Octolasmid gill barnacles to 
prevent the host from molting, but I haven't seen any evidence that they do.  
It would be a fantastic subject to study.

Please let me know if you would like reprints of the above papers and best of 
luck with your crabs.

Dear Jeff,

I'm looking forward to receiving Andrew Gannon's observations.

Just to let you know, I'm in the crab (Scylla serrata) fattening business
in the Philippines on a big scale (by Asian standards).  We buy adult thin
crabs caught from the wild and fatten them in our farm for two weeks (in
individualized floating cages).  Our crab farm is located near an estuary
where there is an abundance of limestone.  Brackish water, limestone and a
high-protein diet seem to combine well because our fattened crabs are full
of fat, taste sweet and have tender juicy meat.

We grow our own food right in the farm. I call this "sustained farming". .
. all homegrown and fresh . . . and nothing to polute the water.  We grow
water cabbage (a relative of the water hyacinth) and feed the root zone to
aquatic (golden) snails and we feed the snails to the crabs.  We also raise
african redworms and feed these to the fish (tilapia).  In turn, we feed
the fish to the crabs.  With this protein-packed diet, our crabs fill out
their carapace in no time.

Our crabs are very much in demand in the local market and we can't grow
enough. We are now planning to establish a crab hatchery at the farm to be
assured of a continuous supply of crabs.  I hope I can call on you from
time to time for scientific adivce.

Mabuhay,

Antonio

Subject: CRUST-L: fat crabs

Dear Antonio,
I read your recent CRUST-L post about your feeding Scylla serrata a high
protein diet for a couple of weeks to 'fatten them up.'  I am curious about
this- do they really store fat?  If so, in what tissue or region of the
body? (I am not aware of crabs containing fat stores, but would like to
know about it if they do) Or, are they really building up their stores of
muscle glycogen, which contains bound water (making them juicy) and imparts
the sweet taste when hydrolyzed in boiling water?

Subject: Bioluminescent gammarids

During the spring plankton blooms here in Juneau I have seen gammarids such
as Anonyx and the mysid Neomysis (probably others as well) with brightly
glowing dinos in their gut. The mysids, being transparent, glow really
bright. The Anonyx glow was faint and was only observed when a number of
specimens were placed in an aquarium as live food for a decorated warbonnet
(fish). -Aaron

Subject: How to individually mark crustaceans

Greetings, crusters-

I am in need of individually marking some crayfish for a behavioral study.
The literature suggested using liquid paper to mark individual animals. I
attempted this and did not have much luck. Would anyone have alternate
suggestions or be able to speak to the effectiveness of this approach-
perhaps I am simply going about it the wrong way?

My thanks!

Debbie -
	We have had good success in marking crayfish on the dorsal surface of the
cephalothorax with white SnoPake, and other typewriter correction fluids. 
It is important to dry the spot to be marked before application, and to
allow the fluid to dry before puting the cray back in its tank.  Just
blowing on it enthusiastically is sufficient.  The marks do eventually wear
off and need to be replaced, but we find that they last for weeks, unless
the animals are scraping their backs against rocks when using a tight space
as a shelter.  They do not seem to groom the material off, so one imagines
that it is not an irritant.

Subject: Bioluminescent Gammarids

The first report of a bioluminescent freshwater gammarid was a 1984 paper by
Tom Bowman & Fanny Phillips (Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington 97(3):526-528) on a
continuous greenish-yellow glow in occasional Hyalella azteca (probably the
most widely distributed freshwater amphipod in the Americas) specimens from
a small trout pond in Virginia, USA.  They attributed it to infection by
pathogenic bacteria, which always resulted in the death of the infected
animal.  They were unsure about the source of the amphipods, commenting that
they may have been introduced into the trout pond from vegetation moved into
the pond from some "rather stagnant pools" in  Florida.  They hypothesize
that the source of the bacteria was probably aquatic vegetation introduced
to the pond from these Florida pools or, less likely, from aquatic
vegetation introduced from local aquarium stores.  In their Discussion, they
mention that most of the amphipods reported to be infected by bioluminescent
bacteria are semiterrestrial and terrestrial species in the superfamily
Talitroidea (within which the fully aquatic Hyalella is found).  Other
accounts of such bacterial bioluminescence in amphipods are found in E. N.
Harvey's 1952 book entitled Bioluminescence (Academic Press) and a 1963
paper by Bousfield and Klawe on an infected California beach hopper species
(Bull. Southern Calif. Acad. of Sciences 62:1-8).

Subject: Various Crayfish Species' "Dances"

   Hello,

   I wwas wondering f anyone on the list could explain why freshwater
crayfish "dance".

   I've held about twelve different species of freshwater crayfish, both
imported and indiginous to Northeast Ohio, USA, and all have exhibited a
phenomenum I cannot explain.

   Many times, while standing idle, the crayfish begin to move one or more
of their appendages in some repetitive motion, often times climaxing in
most of their appendages moving in several different groups. This motion is
distinctly different from any bodily cleaning, and I can't explicitely
connect it to molting. Assuming the water and temperature were correct for
each specie, why does this happen?

   Also, the crayfish only recieved live food and usually lived anywhere
from six months to two years.

   Thanks,
   Gary L. Davenport

Debbie,
I have used underwater paper  (plastic paper) circles (made with a hole
punch) superglued to the carapace between the horns of marine lobsters as a
marking technique to identify individuals which have not moulted.  This
proved highly successful as the circles remained glued for the duration
between moults.

Processa edulis and many other species of the same genus, is especial in
many aspects :

* It does not like very-much brackish waters (and rain!).
* It burries itself in sand (or sediment) head first, "tail" near the
surface but not visible by predators.
* It is active at night only, and difficult to find between early morning
and late evening.
* It is rather a sedentary species (usually) and does not migrate.
* It is very sensitive to oil-spills and other anthropogenic modificatons
of the place where it lives.

I studied Processa edulis for many years in Roscoff (Atlantic : sea with
tides; lower-mediolittoral populations) till Amocco-Cadiz oil pollution and
then in  Banyuls (Mediterranean : infralittoral populations). In order to
answer your question could you give more information/details ?

* How was the abundance estimated (day? night? digging? hand-net? traps?)
* Is the population associated with Zostera belt? algae? sand-grounds?
* Intertidal zone? infralittoral?
* Could a stratification freshwater/seawater have occured?

No, We were there for another purpose, and the observations were more or
less in passing.  In future, should I see them again I will attempt some
more complete examination of the caprellids.  By the time we were
finished with our other live animal tasks the caprellids we brought back
were both no longer alive and no longer luminescing.

Debbie -
 We have had good success in marking crayfish on the dorsal surface of the
cephalothorax with white SnoPake, and other typewriter correction =
fluids.=20
It is important to dry the spot to be marked before application, and to
allow the fluid to dry before puting the cray back in its tank.  Just
blowing on it enthusiastically is sufficient.  The marks do eventually =
wear
off and need to be replaced, but we find that they last for weeks, unless
the animals are scraping their backs against rocks when using a tight =
space
as a shelter.  They do not seem to groom the material off, so one imagines
that it is not an irritant.

Dear Deborah,

     We mark oysters and clams at our facility.  The best thing we have =
come across is using labels made from plastic and indelible ink.  Dry the =
spot to be marked as well as possible. Rub the area with alcohol to =
further dry it.  Place a dot of marine epoxy glue on the spot and stick =
the tag into the dot of glue.  Let glue dry and return animal to tank.  We =
also label some animals with indelible marker directly applied to the =
dried spot on the shell.  We used to use nail polish (I believe it was =
"Cute Tomato" shade) but that was a mess to do.
     Another, temporary method is using a "pony-tail" elastic band =
(fabric-covered rubber band), attaching a label to that and "banding" the =
animal.
     Good luck.

Hi Debbie,

I have used liquid paper to mark yabbies (Cherax destructor).

When doing so I found it useful to:
.   gently scour the carapace with a pad designed for pots and pans,
.   use a liquid paper pen rather than a brush, and
.   allow to dry before returning animal to the water.

Subsequent success of application really depends on what is going to happen
to them. For example the mark won't last long in a depuration tray, they rub
their carapace against the inside of the lid. However I have pulled
non-moulting crayfish out of ponds and aquariums upto three weeks after
marking.

As for alternative suggestions:

.   Mutilation of the telson and/or uropods with scissors is pretty
    effective. but it does leave a scar after moulting. It may be hard to
    see the mark under your experimental conditions.

.   I have read stuff (by Abrahamsson, I think) where crayfish were branded
    with a soldering iron but I have not done this myself.

Hope this helps,

Deborah:

I found that whiteout can work, but sometimes does not adhere well and
may wear off.  My best solution is to use a small drop of a SuperGlue
(cyanoacrylate) on the carapace, then mark with nail polish or a paint
pen (from an art supply house).  Both allow many possible colors and
placement of dots to identify # of molts or individuals.

Solvent based markers like nail polish (toluene?) can kill the epidermis in
recently molted individuals.  Cyanoacrylate is used in surgical glues.  I've
also used cyanoacrylate glue to glue their claws shut.

Do be careful of sticking your own appendages together.

CRUSTers,

Couple of things:

(1) We upgraded our computers recently and during the process the digest
mailer was misplaced.  There have been no DIGEST mailings for the last 2
weeks because of this error. That also means that there was no archive for
that time.  My apologies, especially as we've had some excellent discussion
of late.  I was in Newfoundland looking at snow crabs over part of the
time, hence didn't pick up the error until this week.  There may be a few
more bugs....

(2) I've had many mail bounces.  Sorry, but I delete mail addresses that
bounce more than 5 times.  If you don't receive CRUST-L mail every day or
every other day, then you may want to resubscribe.  If you send a message
and get a strange message from a foreign mail server, just delete it and
wait for your message to appear on CRUST-L.  If it doesn't appear, then
resend it.

(3) If you are subscribed to CRUST-L and find that I'm forwarding your
message to the list, that's an indication that your subscription address
has changed.  This occurs at your institution when servers are changed.
The change isn't always transparent (the mungedomain switch doesn't always
operate correctly).  Just unsubscribe and resubscribe.  If the problem
persists, contact me.

As of Friday, October 16, there were 700 subscribers to the CRUST-L list,
with about 30-40 more in DIGEST mode.  Happy Crustaceology!

Dear crusters,

	I'm looking for information about growth parameters for the Von
Bertalanffy growth function determintated for xanthid crabs in order to
make comparisons with four species of Trapeziidae. I'd really thank if
anyone could help me.

Cheers!

Subject: marking crayfish- thanks!

Wow,

I could write a book with all the fabulous information I received on
tagging crayfish! It looks like I will start low-tech with nail polish and
see how I fare, but I may graduate to some of the more involved methods
suggested.  I assume someone has written this type of thing up, but if not
it would be a great project for me to assemble all these suggestions (in my
spare time if I can find any of that)
my thanks again-

I wanted to copy the reference the next day, the exhibit had gone. (A good

Subject: Marking animals; "dancing"

Hello,

   Deborah Rudnick asked how to individually mark crustaceans, which  
prompted many good answers. Other tricks I've used include women's 
nail polish, which seems okay for the short term, but tends to wear 
off. What I did was to take pieces of water-proof paper, write 
numbers on them in permanent ink, then Crazy Glue them onto the 
carapace. Works well until the animals molt.


From: "Gary L. Davenport" <gdaven19@idt.net>
Subject: Various Crayfish Species' "Dances"

> I wwas wondering f anyone on the list could explain why freshwater

   From Gary's description, this behaviour sounds suspiciously like 
"waving," which has been observed in all sorts of reptantian 
decapods, and not just crayfish. The only paper I know of analysing 
this behaviour is this one. Unfortunately, it doesn't offer a 
definitive functional explanation for the behaviour.

Dear Users,

I am about to begin rearing larval crabs (Cancer pagurus) for a project which 
ultimately will look at the expression of some genes through larval development. 
As a sefty net if you will, I was wondering whether anybody out there is rearing 
Cancer pagurus (or a Cancer spp. for comparative work) and wouldn't mind sparing 
some samples of different staged larvae. The analyses I will use will be molecular 
based and so I don't need that much material. If you can help we can talk about any 
further details.

Thanks in advance for all replies.

People have occassionally posted about the problems of introducing foreign

Are there any reports of the introduction of foreign coral reef crustaceans

Barrier Reef species finding their way to the Caribbean, and the
consequences? Any possiblity that the die-offs of corals in the Caribbean
are caused by pathogens introduced by such introductions?

Subject: CRUST-L: 'The Crayfish'

'The Crayfish' by T. H. Huxley is looking for a
new hole on the World Wide Web.  This classic
book has been made into hypertext now at
http://eldred.ne.mediaone.net/thh/crayfish.htm

But I plan to close my web site (because of the 
chilling effect of new U.S. laws regarding
copyright and the Internet).  Thus if someone
else does not adopt the e-book and distribute
it freely to others from another web site, it
will disappear Nov. 11.  There are no copyright
problems with this book--it is in the public 
domain.  You do not need to be expert in HTML;
you are free to edit it and add new material
if you like, and serve as a resource for
reader questions as you like.

The book is intended as an introduction to
general zoology and was believe it or not
given as a course of lectures to a workingman's
society.  It was translated into several languages
and if these were also put online might indeed
help in our global mutual understanding and
inspire students everywhere with the beauty
of zoology.

If you download the compressed file at
http://eldred.ne.mediaone.net/thh/thh.zip
and decide to post it, I would appreciate a
notice so I can help change links for readers.

Thank you, crusties, for caring about your work!

Subject: CRUST-L: Nitrate & Ecdysis, other physiological effects

I am looking for information on toxicity, impairment, or any other
physiological effects of elevated nitrate levels on shrimp (any or all
peneids.).  

I consider elevated levels to be far in excess of what one might find in
nature, such as those levels encountered in recirculation aquaculture
systems, so that might be anywhere between 50 and 500 ppm.  

I suspect effects on ion transport or exchange, respiratory pigment
effects, stress or impairment especially during ecdysis..

Has anyone written or encountered literature or studies on this, preferably
with dose-response experimental data?

Subject: CRUST-L: crayfish/coliform bacteria/sewage

Has there been work done on crayfish coliform bacteria levels in relation to
sewage leaks and human health risk? I'm trying to direct a literature search
for a colleague tracking a suspected sewage leak in an area where crayfish
are frequently collected for human consumption. We're working in the North
Seattle area of Washington State, where our local species is Pacifasticus
leniusculus. Thanks in advance for any guidance on the literature and past
and current research.

Hi Crust-lers;

Has anybody ever seen bioluminescent Gammarus? I have seen a live 
bioluminescent Gammarus (most probably G. aequicauda) when it eats a 
Chironomus larvae. Is it normal or frequently seen in Gammarus genus?

Subject: CRUST-L: new species

Dear Crust-lers,
I am currently working on my MSc aimed at describing macrobenthos in 
estuaries of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. During my sampling I 
have found a number of crustaceans (isopods, amphipods, and a 
tanaid), which I haven't been able to identify using the literature 
available. It is more than likely that at least some of them are 
previously undescribed species. 
Is anybody out there interested in (a) joint publication(s)?
Please mail me the following details about yourself:
- -ranking as a biologist
- -experience with crustaceans
- -access to literature about Southern African crustaceans/crustaceans 
worldwide (to make sure we don't describe an alien species)
- -any previous publications?

I am looking forward to hearing from you!

The same research has also yielded a fairly large number of unknown 
polychaetes. Does anybody know if there is a polychaete/oligochaete-list?
Or do you know anybody who might be interested in describing some of 
these new species? Presently, it seems that there is no authority on 
polychaetes anywhere in South Africa. Any contribution would provide 
a major boost for this neglected branch of taxonomy, as many of the 
previously undescribed species are actually quite common in our 
estuaries. Anybody interested - please mail your above details to:
                                  zlbprt@zoo.upe.ac.za

Subject: CRUST-L: molecular systematics

Dear crustacean workers,
there are two different things that I want to post to this list:

1) I would like to get in touch with people who might have
ethanol-preserved specimens of the following crabs from the eastern Pacific
in their collections or know where to obtain them:

Aratus pisonii (H. Milne Edwards, 1837)
Armases gorei (Abele, 1981)
Pachygrapsus transversus (Gibbes, 1850)


2) For my presentation at the Amsterdam meetings this last summer, I have
been compiling all the available literature that uses DNA sequence of the
16S rRNA mitochondrial gene for population or phylogeny studies in
crustaceans. In the proceedings volume, I now want to include a table that
summarizes the contents of these studies. I am appending a list of all the
published literature that I am aware of. If there is someone knowing about
additional studies using sequence of this gene in crustaceans (even if
submitted, in press, or conference contributions), please let me know.
Thanks, Christoph

Subject: CRUST-L: crab parasite

Hello crustlers,
Can anyone help me identify a mass which is attatched to the tail flap of a
female sandcrab Portunus pelagicus. At first i thought it was her egg mass
as I haven't seen one in a sandcrab before but it doesn't look like the egg
masses of other crustaceans.
The crab is 15cm carapace width and the mass is 5.5cmx3cm attatched to the
base of her tail and extruding out from her tail. It is soft, cream/brown
colored and smooth surface. It is kidney shaped with a protruding
orifice(anal/oral?) from its concave surface. The orifice has a flat end
which has a tiny pore from which a yellow cheesy material can ooze. The
mass can be seen to contract spasmodically. The crab appears healthy.
I saw a line drawing of a Ctenoplana and the mass looked a bit like that in
shape. I have also heard of rhizocephalids parasitizing mudcrabs under the
tail flap and rendering them sterile. Could this be the same?
Any thoughts appreciated

Leonie,
The mass is a rhizocephalan barnacle named Sacculina granifera Boschma.
The visible part is called a sacculina externa.  For more info see the
references listed below.

Subject: CRUST-L: crab parasite

Thanks to all who responded to my query on the Rhizocephelan. Now I know
where they got the idea for the Alien trilogy!
One further question please. I read that the parasite infects its host when
the crab is in the soft shell stage during a molt. Can it infect the crab
at any other time/way ie. through the severed membrane when a claw/limb is
thrown?  My worry is that the infected crab was kept for a couple of days
in a tank with some of my mudcrabs which I might later use in experiments.
Are they likely to have been infected and do I need to disinfect
biofilters/ tanks etc. and change all the water etc.
Thanks

Subject: CRUST-L: Shrimp Breeding Ecology

Hello Crustlers,
                I am currently trying to rear juveniles of the freshwater
shrimp Caridina gracilirostris for future experiments. The breeding stock
that I am using was caught from the Finniss River in the Northern Territory
of Australia. I have been isolating gravid females in 10 litre fish tanks,
and raising the young without removing the adult female. One female became
gravid again after 2 months since she released the first batch of eggs. What
I would like to know is whether the female can store sperm between moults,
self-fertilise, or was it possible that her young fertilised her, hence
juveniles become sexually mature within 2 months of age. I would be grateful
for any suggestions or references on the ecology of Caridina gracilirostris
or related species.
Or any tips on raising juvenile shrimp in fish tanks, such as food supply or
additives to the water.
        Thanks in advance,
                Sharyn Gale

I'm not sure shrimp can store sperm, long-term, between molts (except
penaeids?). I believe that many caridean shrimp have to molt to spawn
eggs, especially small species. It may be difficult to store sperm, when
you are molting.

Your shrimp could be protandrous sex-changers, as this is commonly
reported in Atyids. My bet is that the young are all little boys, and they
are fertilizing the only available female in the tank.

Are your shrimp brackish or fresh water? There are researchers here
working on species found in anchialine ponds. I'd be happy to forward an
email address to you, if necessary.

Sharyn,

Most crustaceans will lose the sperm plug when molting because part of the shell is within the 
female's reproductive track.  The question here is whether or not the eggs have been fertilized. 
For example, Macrobrachium rosenbergii will lay eggs without a sperm plug present but the eggs 
will not develop and will soon fall off.  Females continue to cycle with or without males; 
however, eggs won't develop.

Subject: CRUST-L: Funds for research in Iceland

The second deadline for proposals from European researchers wishing to
undertake short-term research visits (up to 12 weeks) to the Large-Scale
Facility Sandgerdi Marine Centre in Iceland will be the 15th of November
1998.  There will be another deadline early in 1999. 

Travelling cost, lodging and subsistence at the SMC is covered directly by
the LSF-project under the EU's Training and Mobility of Researchers (TMR)
Programme. 

All scientists from the EU and associated states (Norway, Liechtenstein and
Israel) except from Iceland may submit proposals

The SMC is located in Sandgerdi, a small fishing village on the southwest
coast of Iceland (50 km from the capital city, Reykjavik) with excellent
facilities for work in a friendly atmosphere. 

The main attraction of the SMC is access to the unique collection of benthic
invertebrates from the international BIOICE project (Benthic Invertebrates
of Icelandic Waters) which has been operated since 1992.  During this time
more than 1000 samples have been systematically collected in Icelandic
waters, at depths from 20 to 2400m.  The collection of samples is still in
progress. Most samples have been sorted to 160 of the major taxa of benthic
invertebrates.  
The collection of benthic animals at the SMC offer a wide variety of
possible research projects, including studies on taxonomy, phylogeny,
zoogeography, and biodiversity of benthic communities in the Arctic and the
North Atlantic Oceans.

The SMC is equipped with standard high quality laboratory instruments
(microscopes with camera, videocamera, computers, etc) and running seawater
of exceptionally high quality originating from a 50m deep well in the
lava-beds. The contaminant-free seawater offer unique possibilities for
experimental work with marine organisms, like studies on toxicology,
physiology, behaviour and other general marine biological studies under
controlled conditions.
Access to Scanning Electronic Microscope is available at the University of
Iceland, Reykjavik

Collecting opportunities
The seashore around the lab harbours a great variety of shore organisms that
are easily attainable during low tide (approximately 3.5 m tidal range). A
small research vessel equipped with a wide variety of sampling gear (grabs,
dredges, nets etc.) is available.

Hello Crustlers,
                thankyou for all your helpful replies. Some extra
information I should've included in my first letter is that when the female
became gravid again her juveniles were 2 months old and approx. 17mm in
total length. I separated the female immediately after noticing she was
gravid and she moulted dropping the eggs 7 days later. I then removed her
from this tank, and I have 30 juveniles 1 month old and 8mm in total length.
The shrimp C. gracilirostris is a freshwater species. I have had mixed
replies as to whether the juveniles fertilized the adult or that she had
stored sperm, so any more suggestions would be appreciated! Thanks again,
                Sharyn Gale

Subject: CRUST-L: Nutrient levels

Dear all,

    I'm interested in consumption by fish predators of small crabs (10-30
mm Carcinus maenas), shrimps (10-60 mm Crangon crangon) and juvenile plaice
(10-70 mm Pleuronectes platessa) within shallow bays along the Swedish
coast. I am aware of published size-related ash-free dry weight conversion
factors for these three prey species, and can use these as an estimate of
relative energy content. My question is:

Does anyone know of other more detailed literature/information regarding
their relative nutrient contents - e.g. protein/essential amino acids,
vitamins, minerals etc.? (I'm mainly concerned with summer/autumn
conditions if the information is season-dependent).

    Any help would be gratefully received.

    Thanks - Steve Arnott.

Dear Shane Ahyong,

	Hi, thank you for answer my letter. Well, with "morphs" I mean different
forms of males of the same or different size. There are morfometrics
(strong allometric growth of chela and "maxilpedo") and morphological
differences (number of thorn of the chela and mx. and others)  in the last
molt stage. There are strong differences in behavior, the last stage is
dominant. The male types appeared to be not genetically determined. All
traits mentioned above would  have a direct effect on the fitness of the
different male forms.  Macrobrachium rosenbergii have a very closely
situation, it has three male forms with a behavioral hierarchy order and
physical differences. Furthermore there is an anphipod (Jassa falcata) who
have two discrete male forms, one is the last molt stage and the majority
of matings are effected by those males. There are other species with
different forms of males but genetically determined, for example
Paracerceis sculpta (Isopoda).
	I'm not aware of Saron situation so Ill be great if you send me the
reference.
	If any other person know something like this in other species please tell
me. 
	Thank you, Chao.

Subject: CRUST-L: Anthracophausia

Hey folks,

I wonder if there are any actual information about the systematic position
of the fossil genera Anthracophausia and Essoidia. Are they really
euphausiaceans as assumed traditionally, or something different? Who knows
about these two genera?

Thanks

Id like to know if anyone out there has tried (or know somebody who has)
Rantamaki et al. (1992) method (increase of Mg concentration) for
preventing the spread of Aphanomyces astaci from infected to healthy
crayfish out from lab conditions. We are trying to save a stock of 
reproductors from a valuable population in a hatchery in this way, and
would like to know if there are practical suggestions on this.  Thanks.

Subject: CRUST-L: stature of Pardalisca tenuipes

I recently had the precious chance to observe a living specimen of the
gammarid amphipod Pardalisca tenuipes Sars 1893, collected from 73 meters in
central Puget Sound. It assumed a position much like the figure of
Melphidippella macra in Enequist's 1949 paper on soft bottom amphipods of
the Skagerak: it stood on its feet but had its ventral side up and its
dorsum down. The eyes were a stunning orange, the rest of the body was
solidly off-white.

Has anyone else seen this in Pardalisca? Or can anyone refer me to
literature on behavior of related species? Thanks in advance,

Hello,

can anybody tell me about how to examine the gut contents of Mysis (particulary
M.relicta). I have speciments, which were put in 70 % alcohol in field,
just after taking them out of trawl. But are this way of preserving animals
also good for gut contents investigation?
Thank you in advance.

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: Fw: Transmission microscopy of small crustaceans

Vassily,

I found when doing TEM on Artemia and amphipods that standard recipes for
fixatives, buffers, and so on worked fine. The only tricks were to make
sure the buffers were at the same osmotic pressure as the critters'
environment. This was mostly with marine animals, and I found that 0.1 or
0.2 micron filtered sea water made a fine buffer. Very handy for field
preservations.

I did also try phosphate buffers, and as long as you avoid dibasic K2HPO4
(and to a lesser extent Na2HPO4), you shouldn't have much problem with
Phosphate precipitates in the specimen. Use one of the formulations that
uses NaH2PO4 and NaOH. Cacodylate buffer also works. But with these
systems, you have to make sure you're working at sea water osmolarities,
and a pH of 7.2-7.4. After osmication, the osmotic properties of tissues
are pretty well destroyed, so a standard dehydration schedule can be
followed, same for embedding. Use a hard resin and diamond knife to
section--a glass knife would only increase the misery.

The only other tip is to slice open your larvae. The cuticle will interfere
with penetration of the solutions. If it is possible, cut the larvae open
twice to provide both entrance & exit holes to help the solutions diffuse
through the specimens.

This doesn't sound possible, though, given you're looking at frontal
structures. I'd try for a mid-sagittal bisection of the larvae, assuming
the frontal structures aren't in the mid-line. If so, cut away as much of
the lateral margins as possible.

Gently place the larvae on soft wax or the like to hold them in place while
you cut. Use fresh razor blades (or blade fragments, or chip a bit of glass
or flint, and embed the chip in a blob of wax or such on a stick, sharp
edge out. A good, thin chip makes a nice micro knife.

All you need then is a steady hand. If on shipboard, tell the captain to
stop the ship from rolling...8-). I find skipping coffee in the morning or
a beer for lunch also helps.

Good luck!

Phil

Subject: CRUST-L: feeding behaviour

Dear Edgardo,
I don=B4t have information concerning the feeding behaviour of your species
but from related species in north brazilian mangroves.

Pachygrapsus gracilis is mainly a detritus feeder, maybe it eats some algae
too. In captivity when many animals are kept together they show sometimes
canibalistic behaviour. Feeding occurs mainly during daytime lowtides, I
found a smaller feeding peak during nighttime

Eurytium limosum is a relative of Panopeus depressus. E.limosum is a
predator which feeds on other crabs and mollusks during high tide. I
observed higher feeding activity during the day than during nighttime.
Other canthid crabs like Eurypanopeus spp. seem to feed mainly on algae but
the genus Panopeus seems to be predatory.

I have seen Clibanarius vittatus in the field grazing algae and detritus
from dead logs in the low and middle intertidal. I=B4ve read too that they
consume freshly settled barnacles and may be important in regulating
barnacle recruitment in certain places (Costa Rican Pacific, Sonia Ortega
did a study in Punta Morales, I think the reference appeared in 1986 in J.
Exp.Mar.Biol.Ecol., but i don=B4t remember the title now.

I hope this might be of some use for you

Cheers

Dear Edgardo,
Regarding the feeding behavior of some Costa Rican decapod crustaceans, I
can provide the following references and personal observations:

>Panopeus purpureus
- -> vigorous carnivor. We collected one specimen in Panama and placed it in
an container with other xanthoid and grapsid crabs... only a nice fat P.
purpureus survived!

>Pachygrapsus transversus
- -> gut contents from four sabellariid worm reefs in E Florida: 25-42%
polychaetes, crustaceans sponges, 3-18% diatoms, seagrass, algae, 30-60%
unidentified, 4-10% sand (Gore et al., 1978)

>Panopeus bermudensis
- -> gut contents from three sabellariid worm reefs in E Florida: 32-40%
polychaetes, crustaceans, sponges, 3-8% diatoms, seagrass, algae, 47-54%
unidentified, 3-12% sand (Gore et al., 1978)

Hello Crustlers,

Dean Jerry's request has prompted me to ask a related question.  Has any
one any experience with electrofishing for crayfish who can tell me
anything about the pulse requirements, or mor particularly, has anyone any
data or references on using electroshock for narcotisation of crayfish? I
have an honours student who wishes to explore the idea.

Thanks in anticipation,

Tom.

Try placing electrodes either side of the gonopore and applying a 10mA current,
 this method has been used for Cherax tenuimanus and C. albidus so it is likely
 that you will also have success with C. destructor.

Subject: CRUST-L: Re: BioBridge to Entomology (fwd)

CRUSTers,

Here's somthing new from BIOSIS & CABI Publishing.

Cheers, Jeff


_______________________________________________________________

If you are interested in entomology or other arthropod information you may 
find it useful to know that a  major new resource will be available on the 
Web in January 1999.

The service, called BioBridge to Entomology, is being launched through an 
alliance between BIOSIS and CABI Publishing,  the world s two leading life 
science database publishers.  It will be a gateway to information on all 
arthropods, with a new integrated database at its core, combining the 
resources of BIOSIS Previews?,  CAB ABSTRACTS, and Zoological Record.  As a 
joint resource the database will offer more than other entomology 
information sources available, not only in the number of records included 
but also in the depth and breadth of coverage.

The database will retain the original features of the contributing 
resources, but will allow cross-database searching in an easy and 
user-friendly manner. Term mapping and duplicate record identification will 
add to the functionality of the combined database.

Almost 200,000 references will be included in BioBridge to Entomology, 
dating from 1995 to the present, and the database will be updated on a 
monthly basis.

The database will cover pure and applied information relating to arthropods, 
including insects, arachnids and crustaceans, and encompassing their natural 
biology as well as medical, veterinary, aquaculture and agricultural topics.

If you would like to assess the suitability of BioBridge to Entomology for 
your needs, you can register now for a free 30 day trial to start in 
January.

For more information and to request a free trial visit the BioBridge to 
Entomology Web site at http://www.biobridge.org

Subject: CRUST-L: Andrectomy of freshwater crayfish

Does anyone have any information on surgical procedures for andrectomy in
freshwater crayfish/crawfish?  Also, for creation of reproductive
neofemales, does it need to be done before the sexual characteristics
(gonopores) are evident?  The Israeli's have successfully done it in a small
number of M.rosenbergii which were evidently operated on at less than 1g.
Any discussion appreciated.  Thanks

A Blue Crab Mortality Symposium will be held on Saturday, May 29, 1999,
in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Crustacean Society in
Lafayette, Louisiana.   Any presentation on sources of, or evaluation

Subject: CRUST-L: Biographical information on Dr. R.K. Kuninova-Pasternak

Dear Colleagues,

.    Dr. Gary and Anderson and I are building a Tanaidacean Web Site. As
one aspect of this venture, we are presenting biographical sketches
[including lists of  publications and taxa described] for some well
known workers in the group [e.g.  Bacescu, Lang,  Sieg].

    In this connection, I have been unable to obtain any biographical
information on Dr. R. K. Kudinova-Pasternak, the leading Russian
specialist on Tanaidacea, who has recently retired.

    If anyone can supply me with such information (date of birth,
education, professional positions, and research), I would be most
grateful.  Also, a photograph of her would be very helpful.

    Please contact me through my email address above if you have any
such information about her or know of anyone that I could contact who
does.

 Thanks for any help.

Sincerely,

Richard W. Heard

Subject: CRUST-L: Question on Amphipods

Greetings:

I have a couple basic questions for any amphipod biologists who care to
respond. Recently, I observed amphipod activity at low tide in the
intertidal sand of the Indian River estuary on Hutchinson Island,
Florida. Interspersed on the compacted sand were large, irregularly
shaped and slightly elevated patches of "fluffed" sand. Individuals were
moving freely about on the compact sand; however, when I scraped away
the fluffy sand, hordes of amphipods poured out from below. It was
reminiscent of the teeming of ants after a disturbance of a mound. My
questions: What would be the likely species? What was the observed
gregarious behavior and where can I read up more about this aspect of
amphipod biology? Thanks.
TAF

Dear Crusters,

Ia have been observing the mailgroup for he past haf year with 
interest since a lot of chat among you has resulted to good ideas
and more information than anticipated. I would like to post 2 questions
that have been bothering me lately:

1. Penaeidae shrimps are characterised as open thylecum and closed thylecum
regarding the morphology of the spermsac receptacle. However, I have not
seen any textbook where the shrimp species are positively distignuished
based on 
this character or any reference on which species is which. Is there any
reference 
or summary on this subject?

2. There are a lot of scientists in the list from the States but also from
Europe.
I have not seen any attempt to prepare a scientific network for
proposal submissions to NATO or the EU etc. There will be a lot of money
given away in 1999 with the 5th research project framework from the EU
and according to my experience noone is ready to submit  beceaus of the
lack of networks of scientists and institutes. Isnt anyone out there
interested in such
coordinated  research???

Subject: CRUST-L: CRUSTANET

Dear Crusters,

Since the last message that I have posted in CRUST-L
I had 3 memeber for the possibility to establish a medium
network of scientists/institutes (15-20 will be enough It think)
in order to have the eligibility
to submit a proposal or some proposals on crustacean biology,
fishery and aquaculture (with environmental and socio-economic
aspects too) within the 5th European Union Framework that will
be announced in 1999. The name of the net is CRUSTANET and
we all hope it will serve us well.

For this reason, I am starting a list of persons that will participate in 
such future network and I hope that I will receive more. Currently, it is
unknown which coutries outside the EU will be eligible and therefore,
everyone interested should send me an e-mail and join the list. 
There will be opportunities for all with other projects that are 
announce continously. In your mails please state you exact
interest within the following disciplines, which I think are enough: 
+ fisheries, 
+ biology (genetics, molecular biology etc.)
+ coastal managemenet, 
+ ecology and 
+ aquaculture

Also other disciplines are encouraged. Perhaps I will not be able to assist
you
as a pertner with some disciplines such as genetics, but this list will be
available
to all of you, once prepared and you can manage your own contacts.

Best regards to all of you,

Dear Crusters,

Since the last message we have a good number of
participants in this list of future projects from the EU.
Please NOTE THAT THIS NETWORK WILL NOT REPLACE
CRUST-L  but will be only a list of interested people
for research collaboration between European countries
and Third Eligible countries.

As I think that this list will be rather big, I will post 
the names and interests in my web page and everyone of
you interested in collaborative research will find easy
partners for this.

My web page is: www.geocities/Athens/Atlantis/1963/index.html
and the names will be posted early next week. Until then there are
rthings to download and see there. The site is ubder construction and
regularly
updated. 

Thank you again for your interest.

Dear "azmi5085" and dear list members,

I just wish to remark that it is not very polite to post such generic and
anonymous requests, without specifying the name of the sender, for what
reason and use he's looking for info on crustaceans, and what kind of info
he needs.

A brief presentation and some more explicit notes are needed, in my humble
opinion.

Regards,
Carlo Pipitone

Dear CRUST-Lers,

is there anybody out there who has the correct bibliographic 
data of this publication:

HUELSENBECK, J. P.; BULL, J. J.; CUNNINGHAM, C. W. (1996): Combining
data in phylogenetic analysis. Trees (Berlin, Heidelberg) 11: 152-158.

there must be a bug in it; is it the wrong journal? Anyway - our 
libraries gave it up. Before running amok, I think it is a good idea 
to ask in CRUST-L, may be somebody of you can help. 

Best wishes to all of you

Wulf

Try "TREE" (Trends in Recent Evolution and Ecology?), not "Trees".


Good luck,

Subject: CRUST-L: CRUSTANET announcement

Dear Crusters,

thank you all for your response to CRUSTANET attempts. Since you are
so many I cannot answer to you personally so please excuse me for this.
All persons that applied have been included in the list regardless country
or EU eligibility since the net, as I told you from the start, is intented
to bring people together for projects. The list will be posted in my web page
since TODAY and I would like to urge you to start talking to each other
to form groups and decide the subjects of your projects. We do not have time
since the first announcements will come until March 1999 and there will be
no time
for network formation and administration procedures. Therefore, I suggest that
all of you TRULY interested to get some good funds, start discussing the
matter
personally with others interested in the same subject and with your
Institutes.

Secondly, I made a mistake posting my web page URL to the CRUST list:
the correct one is:
	http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Atlantis/1963/index.html
and follow the CRUSTA-net link.
Thank you Dr Jean-Robert BONAMI of IFREMER for the notice of mistake.

Again I would like to stress out the following, in order the list will be
useful to all
please consider the following:

1. Be dedicated to the possibility to get involved in an international project
2. Since you will be 100% partners you too have the possibility to express
your opinion,
    so have one.
3. In order to get in the list I need the following data:
    Name:
    FULL address:
    Phone, fax
    E-mail
    Detailed interests on crustaceans (species/families, aquaculture,
pathology etc.)

    This way, anyone interested will be able to contact you for a certain
project.

I have send to some of you, a request for additional information. Please
forward them to me.

Thank you for now. Note that I will post also information on EU projects as
they come in.

Best regards to all,

Subject: CRUST-L: TREE = Trends in Ecology & Evolution

Dear CRUST-Lers,

Whow! The high number of responses is proportional to my feeling of 
embarrasment (that the solution is so simple :-) 
The little "s" at the end of "trees" and the fact that there really 
exists a Journal "Trees" (Berlin & Heidelberg, ISSN 0931-1890) 
together with my progressive amnesia were a bad coincidence.
However, there is no reason for running amok anymore.

Thanks to all of you for your helpful hints. Enjoy the Christmas 
time (if you can). 
Merry Christmas to you!

Wulf

Subject: CRUST-L: CRUSTANET announcement

Dear Crusters,

good morning/evening again to all. This came to me but since I have not=20
sorted out the CRUSTANET list (too many interesting people arrived)
and since I am not in this field myself, everyone wishing to collaborate
with our colleague from Australia, please let him know.

Another important thing is that most of the mails received for CRUSTANET
stated that the persons never thought about collaborative research. How is
this possible?
Where everybody receives his funds from? I would like to have a small forum
on this because it is important. Most of us are lost in microscopes and=20
basement labs smelling formol and we wake up sometime and find out
that there are no funds to continue and, most important, we do not know=
 where
to get them. Your opinions, please post them to the list and not me directly
because everybody should know.

Thanks again, and do not forget Mr Australia here. He needs help.

From: conides@posidon.ncmr.gr
Subject: CRUST-L: CRUSTANET announcement

Dear Crusters,

again I have to say that the offer of collaboration in the CRUSTA-net list is 
increasing day by day. In my web page you will find all persons that signed in
until December 17. IF ANYONE THAT REQUESTED TO BE IN THE LIST, IS NOT 
APPEARRING IN THE PAGE, PLEASE SEND ME AN E-MAIL REQUEST AGAIN.

There are also some things that I have to clarify, concerning CRUSTA-net,
in order
truly to benefit from this. Also as I can see  that you do not seem to have
much experience
on the subject "RESEARCH FUNDS".

When it comes to sign an application or a contract for a research project
with the EU or other 
international funding organisations, the scientists that are involved (and
they will
be members of the CRUSTA-net perhaps) WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO SIGN THE
APPLICATION FORM AND/OR 
CONTRACT ON BEHALF OF THEIR ORGANISATION (INSTITUTE OR PRIVATE COMPANY)
otherwise
they will not be able to participate in. NOONE PRIVATE/FREELANCE CAN
COLLABORATE 
AS EQUAL PARTNER TO SUCH PROJECTS. FOR THIS REASON ALL OF YOU THAT WOULD 
LIKE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST (of course all of you can, I am not
entitled to 
exclude anyone) HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS. This means that all of you in
the list
MUST BE SURE that you can represent your Institute/Company and commit your
Institute/Company
in ANY project at the administration level - also to stamp your application
with the official stamp
of the Institute/Company and assign the President of the
Board/Director/Manager etc. as the
responsible administrator for the project. You will be the co-ordinator of
the project
but YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION TO BACK YOU UP. This is especially
important 
for students (we have one in the list). THIS LIST IS NOT A JOB/CAREER
OPPORTUNITY. 
If anyone would like, I can send by fax, previous applications of EU
projects to see what is required.
JUST IMAGINE THE POSSIBLE SITUATION TO ORGANISE A PROJECT, WORK FOR ALMOST
6 MONTHS
TO PREPARE THE PROPOSAL, RECEIVE THE FUND AND FIND OUT THAT HALF OR ALL OF
YOUR
PARTNERS CANNOT SIGN THE CONTRACT. 

Since I anticipate that this will happen, ALL OF YOU THAT ARE ALREADY
ENLISTED IN CRUSTA-net
RETURN TO ME A SIMPLE E-MAIL STATING THAT YOU CAN SIGN SUCH A CONTRACT ON
BEHALF
OF YOUR INSTITUTE/COMPANY OR THAT YOU HAVE THE COMPLETE SUPPORT FROM YOUR
ADMINISTRATION TO DO SO. Otherwise, please request to be deleted from the
list since the
problem that you will cause to the rest of us, will be GREAT!!! If
required, I can prepare
another page with such persons that can be SUB-CONTRACTORS to research
projects
(SUB-CONTRACTORS do not sign with the EU but they sign private agreements with
project partners for a special task to be undertaken). PLEASE BE VERY
CAUTIOUS ON THAT
AND DO NOT HESITATE TO REQUEST TO BE EXCLUDED FROM THE LIST. The list should
include persons that are eligible to be EQUAL PARTNERS in research projects.

I do not wish this list to become the disaster for any of you that wish to
take your chances
and prepare a good and sound proposal with some of us. Again, this list is
something that we
wish to benefit from.

Best ragerds to all, and I expect your e-mails asap

Subject: CRUST-L: odd question

Dear crustlers!

I have a general question, which does NOT concern crustacea,
but there may be one of the naturalists among you, who COULD help:

Years ago I read in a book on ?Galapagos? among others about a man who decided
to dropout and stay for the rest of his life in direct contact with nature.
Before he moved to the island he asked a dentist to remove all his teeth
for being sure he would not have trouble with them, far away from civilisation,
and he decided to become a strict vegetarian. ((Just here I doubt how he
could eat all these vegetables without teeth, but at least my memory tells
the story like that)). - He ended up as strict anti-vegetarian, having
ONLY meat as nutrition, using teeth of metal.

Obviously I found this story strange and told it at that time to our
nearly-grownup-children.

Now, many years afterwards, our eldest son wants to know the "exact story",
names, facts, years...., for citing it!

And his mother nearly forgot the whole story, and cannot help him.

Does anyone know this episode, and could supply more than I can??



Please don't be angry if I have stolen your precious time for this crazy
"problem", and let me add many very cordial wishes for the last
advent-days, and of course for a peaceful and merry Christmas!

Traudl Krapp

Greetings, crusters-

Nearing the end of a first round of experiments with Pacifasticus
Leniusculus, I will soon no longer be in need of my subjects. The same
goes for a few E Sinensis crabs Ive been working with. Could anyone give
me some advice as to the most humane way of disposing of my subjects?
Rerelease is not necessarily out of the question for the crayfish but its
not possible for the crabs. Thank you for your assistance from one just
learning the ropes of crustacean caretaking!

From: Tom McRae <mcraet@deakin.edu.au>
Subject: Re: CRUST-L: crayfish euthanasia with kindness?

Hi Debbie

The usual way is just to put them in the freezer to
chill/anaesthetize/narcotise them into a state from which they do not
recover. 
Then they can be disposed of as any other putresecible waste (or cooked and
eaten if they haven't had anything nasty done to them!)
If they are used to living in cold water, I would suggest an overdose of
diethyl ether (saturated solution in their aquarium water) as an
alternative - but remember about the safety requirements for using ether. 

Cheers, and Christmas wishes,

Tom.

are mixed in the same water body, and I would like to study the

Subject: CRUST-L: Amphipods and mollusks

	Crutlers,
		My colleague Teunis Jansen in Copenhagen recently asked me about recent
literature about associations between amphipods and mollusks, a subject I
wrote a short review on 27 years ago (Time flies!).
		As this may perhaps be of somewhat more general interest, and especially
as I hope you will be able to help me to make the list less incomplete, I
have copied my mini-review on email, even though a lot of italics,
underlinings etc etc disappear that way. Please send comments, additions,
corrections etc etc  to wim@imv.uit.no.
		I wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy, healthy and harmonious 1999!

	ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN AMPHIPODS AND MOLLUSKS, A MINI-REVIEW

							Wim Vader, Dec. 1998


A short review of the scattered literature about associations between
amphipods and mollusks has been given by Vader in 1972. Since then a number
of new records has been published , but the general picture has not changed
appreciably.
As before a few categories are excluded, viz. the amphipods that are found
among the mussels in a mussel-bank etc, those that associate with hermit
crabs and are found in their host-shells, and those that use small
gastropods or scaphopods as shelter, cq as a house to carry around. Good
examples of the last type are Siphonoecetes sabatieri (cf Gauthier 1941;
see also Ortiz & Nazabal 1984 on Corocubanus guitarti), and Photis
conchicola (cf Carter 1982).

An interesting case, but somewhat peripheral to the subject at hand are the
reports of amphipods mimicking mollusks. The closely related pleustids
Pleustes depressus and P. platypus (now both transferred to Thorlaksonius,
vide Bousfield & Hendrycks 1994) have both been recorded to mimic the
gastropod Mitrella (or Alia) carinata (Carter 1979, Crane 1969), while
Goddard (1989) has reported the mimicry of nudibranchs by Podocerus sp.
Still a different use is that made by Hyperiella dilatata of the shells of
the pteropod Clione limacina, again as a protective measure (McClintock &
Jansen 1990).

Real associations involving live mollusks still fall in the same two main
categories recognized by Vader (1972): amphipods sheltering under the food
of mainly intertidal gastropods or large chitons, and amphipods living in
the pallial and/or mantle cavity of large bivalves.

Amphipods and intertidal gastropods (chitonids):
In the first instance the amphipods involved are mostly Hyalidae or
Calliopiidae/ Pontogeneiidae; important studies on this type of
associations are those of Branch (1975, on Calliopiella michaelseni from
Patella spp in South Africa) and Underwood & Verstegen (1988, on Hyale
media from Cellana tramoserica in SE Australia).
Examples of Hyalidae involved in this type of associations are :
Hyale grandicornis from Acmaea and Lottia spp in California (Johnson 1968),
and from Patella spp in South Africa;
Hyale media from Cellana tramoserica in SE Australia (Underwood & Verstegen
1988);
H. nilssoni from Patella vulgata and Nucella lapillus in Norway (Brattegard
1963, Vader 1972);
H. perieri from Patella spp in Great Britain (Spooner 1957);
Parhyale hawaiensis from large Chiton tuberculatus on Puerto Rico (Glynn
1968); this species is also recorded from the bivalve Septifer virgatus by
Ong Che & Morton (19xx) from Hong Kong shores.

The following Calliopiidae-Pontogeneiidae are involved in similar
associations:
Calliopiella michaelseni from several species of Patella in S.Africa ( Koch
1949, Barnard 1955, Griffiths 1975, Branch 1975);
Haliogeneia crosnieri Lowry & Stoddart from the red abalone Haliotis rubra
in SE Australia (Lowry & Stoddart 1998);=20
Paramoera austrina from Patella aenea in the Falkland Islands (Stebbing
1920);=20
Paramoera capensis from Patella spp in S. Africa (Branch 1975).

In the case of the Hyalidae several authors mention that the association
involves primarily juvenile specimens, while the adults live elsewhere; no
such data exist for the Pontogeneiidae. Virtually all the recorded hosts
are algae scrapers, and it may therefore be that the amphipods derive food
as well as shelter from their hosts. (For Nucella, the only exception, see
Vader 1972)

Amphipods from inside Bivalves:
This is a very different group of amphipods, biologically apparently more
closely related to the associates of Porifera and Tunicata (cf Vader 1984).
Probably a great many associations of this type have been overlooked until
now, the ones reported all belong to one of four amphipod taxa: the
Lysianassoidea, the "gammarids",  the Leucothoidae and the Stenothoidae.
The bivalve hosts belong to many, taxonomically widely scattered taxa, and
both epifaunal and infaunal species are represented. The following
associations are known to me at the moment:=20

Lysianassoidea
Anonyx affinis from Musculus spp in Arctic waters (Just 1983)
Orchomene kaikai from the vent bivalve Calyptomena phaseoliformis
(Bellan-Santini 1990)
Perrierella audouiniana from Pinna sp (Chevreux 1935), possibly also from
Modiolus (Jones 1948)

"gammarids"
The aberrant species in the genus Cardiophilus have often been reported
from the mantle cavity of various cardiid bivalves in the Black, Azov and
Caspian Seas (Sars 1896, Elian 1961, Osadchikh 1977). This species has
aberrant mouthparts, which led both Sars (loc.cit.) and Pirlot (1932) to
presuppose a semiparasitic habit.

Leucothoidae
Many species of this family, esp. the so-called cosmopolitan L. spinicarpa,
are greatly in need of a taxonomic revision. Records of associations
involving this family are of a somewhat anecdotical nature, and probably
represent the tip of an iceberg.
Leucothoe furina from Pinna sp in Indonesia (Ledoyer 1979);=20
L. "spinicarpa" from Pecten in Britain (Walker 1895), as well as from Lima
scabra and Atrina rigida in Cuban waters (Ortiz 1975)
L. species from the living fossil Pholadomya candida (Morton 1980)

Stenothoidae
The two Metopa species appear to be obligate associates of their bivalve
hosts, but little is known about the biology of these associations.
Metopa glacialis occurs in various species of Musculus in Arctic waters
(Shoemaker 1955, Just 1983, Vader & Beehler 1983) as well as in Musculus
koreanus in Korean waters (Ockelmann 19xx).
Metopa groenlandica occurs in Pandora glacialis in Greenland waters
(Stephensen & Thorson 1936).

In this type of associations, the amphipods involved probably not only
derive shelter, but also the major part of their food through the feeding
activities of the host. No detailed studies  of any of these associations
have ever been undertaken, however.

This mini-review has been sent out primarily to ask for comments and
additional references of published or unpublished amphipod-mollusk
associations.

Hi folks,

Zostera on the California coast are examples) and they must be occurring on
coral reefs. To who knows what end? Especially given the lousy knowledge of
small reef species and the critters that live inside the reef. Any more

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: exotic pests on coral reefs

I know that the subject regarding invasion of exotic species was 
directed towards coral reefs (and that Crust-L is an invert listproc), 
but here in San Diego there has been an introduction of a fish species 
in to an Estuary.  At Los Penasquitos Lagoon, a somewhat healthy 
wetland, someone decided to drop off some pet fish they didn't want any 
more.... some sail fin mollies.
These fish are excellent osmo-regulators and can tollerate salinities 
well exceeding normal sea water.  To say the least, they have competed 
well with the native fish, and created a niche for them selves.  It has 
yet to be seen if these fish will have any long term impacts, but one 
can only imagine that there will be.

Subject: Re: CRUST-L: exotic pests on coral reefs

Hello,
Talking about marine invasions, I got the oppurtunity to say we are
finishing a paper on the ability of the green crab Carcinus maenas to fed
in hypoxic waters. In summer, we saw Carcinus eating in waters where the
partial pressure of oxygen, PO2, was 2-3 kPa (remember that in normoxic
water, PO2 =3D 21 kPa!). Obviously this astonishing capacity to behave like
that is a clear advantage for invading numerous new biotopes. We would like
to have some kind of overall view on its recent expansion and we are
looking for papers on the subject. Any help is welcome.
Best wishes and merry christmas to everybody !!!

I summarize my results thanking all of you who reacted!

1: from USA Virginia)
Isn't that part of a novel (which was called "Galapagos") by Kurt
Vonnegut? I did not think that was a true story.  If there was some
truth behind the story, I know nothing about it.  Hope this helps a
little.

2: from Italy)
the version I have heard about was that the teeth of a whole family (male,
female and a few children) were ALL removed. I have heard the story from my
mother during the end of years '50, and the source was probably nothing but
the Reader's Digest. That's all I know about it but, please, let's remain in
touch and tell me what you can find about it. During the
last 30 years I have been working for months in quite desert places such as
the southern Somalian coast and the Bajuni Island or Aldabra Atoll and this
story is following me as a kind od nightmare !


3: from USA Virginia)
Well, this is really odd. My wife read me an amusing story about the
Galapagos last week which was part of a novel she was reading.  Believe
it or not, it was the story of your toothless man.  The novel in which
the story was related was "The Evolution of Jane" by Katherine
(Kathleen?) Schine.  I thought the story was made up by the author, but
perhaps not (or perhaps its on a par with urban legends).  As far as I
remember, the man (a dentist) and his lover chuck their spouses and head
for the Galapagos, having their teeth pulled prior to leaving.  I don't
remember much more than that. Good luck finding the book.


4: region not given)
 I lived in Galapagos for many years and know the story well.
The gentelman was
Dr. Ritter, a german dentist. Went to Galapagos as you said, to the Island of
Floreana. He brought with him his "wife" Dore Strauch, who wrote a book about
their adventures. The story is filled with love intrigue and murder, I wish I
could remember the  name of the book, but I'm sure a search of her name will
bring it up. Hope this helps.

I have the name of the book, it is "Satan Came to Eden" by Dore Strauch,
published in New York, 1936

5: Slovenia)
I definitely wish you and your family (those curious children
included) much fun with a lot of VARIED food next days.

Subject: CRUST-L: Some questions

Dear colleagues,
I have several different questions for you and would aprreciate 
any possible help.

1)Does anybody know the taxonomic authority (including the 
year) of the following genera and species? I am also interested in 
possible synonyms.

Pyxidognathus

Pachygrapsus polypodus
Percnon demani
Percnon pilimanus
Geosesarma scandens
Sesarma gabonensis

Heterograpsus barbimanus Heller,
Plagusia spinosa MacLeay,
Sesarma lanatum Alcock,

2)Does somebody know whether Pseudograpsus intermedius 
from Indian waters is a valid species? And, is this its presently 
recognized name?

3)I am interested in a paper published in Mahasagar, this journal 
is in a Spanish Library but not the volume that I am looking for, 
21, have anybody this volume available? Or the paper:

Pasupathi, K. & Kannupandi, T. (1988) The zoeae, megalopa 
and the first crab of the mangrove crab Metaplax elegans De 
Man, cultured in the laboratory. Mahasagar, 21: 145-160.

4)Is there a reference in the literature on the % of decapod 
larvae in the total of inshore plankton samples?

5)Does anyone know about a larval description of a first zoeal 
stage from the genus Paragrapsus? If not, does anyone have 
access to species of this genus and would be able to obtain the 
first zoeal stage by bringing an ovigerous female into the lab? I 
am in urgent need of those larvae for a comparison of grapsid 
zoeal morphology and would gretaly appreciate any help!

6)Finally, does somebody know the e-mail address or fax of Dr. 
Daniella Pessani from Universita di Torino?

I would be very grateful for any help in any of above questions,
Thanks in advance and my best wishes for the New Year,

Jose

Subject: CRUST-L: invasive species

Dear Debbie,
	Thanks for your response and your comment ! This is just to tell you that
I tried the web number you gave us but it does not work ! Could you be kind
enough for checking it ?
	Otherwise you told that you are working on the chinese crab. We already
work a little bit with this animal, looking for its arterial Po2 at the
anaerobic threshold. We found that it was about 1 kPa. If you are
interested we published it in 1992 (Respir Physiol, 88, 247-256: When are
resting water-breathers lacking O2 ? Arterial Po2 at the anaerobic
threshold in crab)
