No, however IC can access an integer value
declared in assembler, which amounts to the same
thing.

Just precede the definitition with the line
variable_C_name, where "C_name" is what you want
the variable to be called in IC.  I usually make
the C name the same as the assembler name as in
this example:


variable_global_variable
global_variable   FDB   0
.
.
.
    LDX       global_variable
    INX
    STX       global_variable

----------------

int silly_routine ()
{
    global_variable = global_variable + 1;
    return(global_variable);
}


-----------------

...Of course you have to load your ICB file before
your C file when you're doing this.
