I never say imagecraft C can't use peek and poke???? I can see, you don't
understand my  mail. Wich i see is : make beep the handy is not simply put a
byte in a place into the memory, no way. you have to write a interrupt
routine , and do adiitional work . Your large explications over that
question sound well , but is not really true. Chuck Mcmanis send me a e-mail
explaining to me how to make beep the handy, i reply that for you so you
will know how it wotk really.
Anyway thanks for your time. Ah, yes i'm live in Argentina and where you
from?.
