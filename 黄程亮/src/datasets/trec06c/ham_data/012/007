Bill,
I have not been able to try that with the v2x onboard the bot so far, every
time I try to load anything while the v2x is running my handyboard wants to
crash.
Someone out there must have a code that they would be willing to share with
some of us less experienced IC furture code writers.
I plan to mount the v2x as far from the motors as possible even if it means
mounting on some type of mast and trying to shield it someway. I'll let you
know how it turns out when I get a workable code loaded.
