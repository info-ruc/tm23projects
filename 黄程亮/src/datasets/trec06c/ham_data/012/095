Thanks everyone for your help with the pcode_hb.s19 file.  You guys rule!
I asked if the seeminly abundant analog sensors are any use at all with
object detection and i got a pretty much split vote.  Ive been told these
are the wrong kinds and that they are only very useful with line
following.  Should I just switch to my alternative program of having
feelers and bump sensors or do you think it can be done with analog IR
sensors giving a return value for an object that enters the IR beam?

Thanks!
