RE: TRANSFER OF ($42,000.000.00 USD).My name is MR.Robert Mark; I 
am 
the operational manager in account Section in charge of credit and 
foreign bills of one of the prime banks Here in Nigeria. I am writing 
in respect of a foreign customer of my  Bank (MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER 
from Munich, Germany) who perished with his Whole families on 25TH 
JULY,2000.There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this 
great late INDUSTRIALIST who died without a written or oral WILL 
attached to the account. Since his death, I personally have watched 
with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive 
as no one has come to claim his funds and no other person knows about 
this account or anything  concerning it, The total amount involved is 
$42,000,000.00 USD.  On this note, I decided to seek for a reliable 
foreigner who will act as the foreign beneficiary of the fund from the 
deceased by providing his/her bank account where the fund will be 
transferred into for immediate investment on any viable project as no 
one has come up to be the next of kin. 
In view of this I got your 
contact through my personal search to see if  you can assist by 
providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a reliable 
person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her 
personal account. At the conclusion of the transfer 65% of  the fund 
will be for us here, we would give you 30% of the total  transfer sum, 
while the remaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both 
parties might incur during the transfer process.
I wait in 
anticipation 
of your co-operation in reply.
Your'S sincerely,
MR. 
Robert Mark.
