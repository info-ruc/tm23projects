Nari:

I don't know of a precompiled SGI version.  You can build one yourself
from the sources listed in ftp://cher.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/
interactive-c/source/.

Also, please be aware that when you send mail to
"handyboard@media.mit.edu" you are reaching 300+ people.  Maybe this
is what you intended, but you also seem to be trying to reach me
personally, in which case you should use fredm@media.mit.edu.
