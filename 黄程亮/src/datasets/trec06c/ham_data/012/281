Thanks everyone..Ill check those out.  Im probably not going to do
anything that requires soldering things on the handy board.  Unfortunatly,
im only borrowing this one.  I'll just see if i can borrow a rover with
less power hungry motors from the university.
      I think that getting smaller motors is about the last obstacle with
our project on building an autonomous robot.  Everything works great on
the handyboard and sensor end of thing and I goofed around for an hour or
so getting it to play the theme from the pink panther, looney tunes, or
nothing at all depending on the  inputs from the knob.  
This should go over well.  The project has to be done in about 3 weeks and
in about a month is this huge expo with all the different high schools.
Robots impress people. I think we have good chances.
