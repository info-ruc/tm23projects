Hello All,

I wish to program the Handy Board by plain machine code.

Does anyone know how to download a plain binary S19 code, using a 
standard serial terminal, communicating to the given IC monitor.
Also, how would I get the downloaded machine code to run.

In short ( I known this question must have been asked before ) is 
there the ability to communicate to the Handy Board, like Buffalo 
was able to communicate to the EVB boards.

Thanking you,
