The line "variable_sonar_time" indicates that the
immediately following FDB will be available to IC
as an integer variable named "sonar_time".

The next line with the FDB is just a regular
assembler definition statement to allocate storage
for the variable and name it for assembler access
purposes.

Yes, IC integers have to be 2 bytes.

My guess is "yes and no".  I am guessing they are
pulling a trick so that IC sees a 2-byte variable
while assembler sees a 1-byte variable.

I haven't seen this sort of thing before.  If you
didn't copy it wrong and if it really works then
my guess would be that it is defining a
single-byte value for assembler usage, prefixed by
a guaranteed null byte so that IC can access it
properly.
