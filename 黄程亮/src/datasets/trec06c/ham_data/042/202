Sorry to say, but the capacitance does change depending upon
the applied voltage.  As you increase the plate voltage a force is
created pulling the plates together.  This effectively INCREASES
the capacitance.  The good news is that this enhancement is very
negligable.

In my personal experiance, Electrolytic caps suck.  They are
usually at best +/- 20%.  When I design a circuit, I use the
good old safety factor for the working voltage to be from 1.5 to 2
times the operating voltage.  You never know if you will hook
up the circuit to a voltage sufficient to breakdown the lower
voltage caps.
