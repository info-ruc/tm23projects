	For electrolytic capacitors, you want the printed voltage to be the 
closest voltage above the voltage you are operating at.  The voltage listed 
on the can is the one it works best at.  Careful with the polarity.  Reversed 
polarity will cause the capacitor to heat and deform.  Large voltage in 
reverse polarity will cause the capacitor to explode.

	Yes, tolerance is the error in the manufactured value.  A 5% 
resistors actual value is within 5% of the printed value.  So if the resistor 
is Brown, Black, Orange, Gold; the value is 10,000 ohms +/- 5%.  So the 
actual value of the resistor is between 9500 ohms and 10500 ohms.

hope this helps,
