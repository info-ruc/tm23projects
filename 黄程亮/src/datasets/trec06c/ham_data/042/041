I'm having a lot of trouble with the first assembly of the handy
board(4.1)...I installed all the parts, but the led does not light and I
get zero voltage at GND and +5v...What could cause zero voltage accross
the board??? I already switched D3(like the manual says) and U13 looks
just like the picture..

please reply,
Jon Schuck
