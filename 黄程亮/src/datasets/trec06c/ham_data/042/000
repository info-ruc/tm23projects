Newton Labs does offer smooth PWM routines for IC3.2. Check
ftp://newtonlabs.com/contrib/smooth-pwm/ for details.  I have used these with my handy board
and expansion board (only simple test) and it worked
fine.  It does require some changes to the lib_hb.c file to make it work with the expansion
board.  Hope this helps.
