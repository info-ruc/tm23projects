    Kind of. Electrolytics are indeed made by plates in a conductive solution,
    however when the voltage increases, it pulls the plates together (standard
    columbs law stuff). When you exceed the rated voltage the force on the
    plates is enough to pull the plate _through_ the dielectric and to make
    contact.

Surely you jest.  Do the math and compute the forces.  Also, explain
how an entire plate moves through an entire layer of insulator---where
is the insulator -going-?

My understanding of how most caps failed was because an -arc- formed
through part of the dielectric.  In essence, a spark punches a hole
through it at some point where one of the plates just happens to have
a microscopic peak and hence a locally-higher charge density.  The arc
then (a) continues to short out the cap, and (b) generates a lot of
heat.
