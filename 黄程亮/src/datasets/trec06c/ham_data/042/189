	Your comments aren't taken as being harsh, but I'm still not sure I 
agree.  Now I must say that my comments are based on something I heard in the 
rummer mill, but it still sounds plausible.  What I heard goes like this.
	Electrolytic capacitors are formed by metal plates placed in a 
conductive solution.  A thin dielectric coating formed on one of the plates.  
The rummer states that the thickness of this dielectric coating varies 
slightly with applied voltage.  So (according to the rumor), if you want the 
capacitor to operate at its rated capacitance, you must operated it at its 
rated voltage.
	That is the rumor as I've heard it.  I have not really heard anyone 
speak against it other than to say that it is common practice to use 
capacitors larger than is needed.  In most power supply applications such 
attention to detail is usually not called for.  And if your using capacitors 
in tuning applications, you probably aren't using electrolytics.
	Is there anyone on the list that is involved in the manufacture of 
electrolytics that can speak about the truth of this rumor?
