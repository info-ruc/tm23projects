Kind of. Electrolytics are indeed made by plates in a conductive solution,
however when the voltage increases, it pulls the plates together (standard
columbs law stuff). When you exceed the rated voltage the force on the
plates is enough to pull the plate _through_ the dielectric and to make
contact. The turns the capacitor into a wire and, if current continues to
flow, into a small explosive device. If it is oil filled (not as common
these days) you get a smokey orange fire ball. (very impressive but scary
as hell the first time!)

This is why electrolytics get bigger for a higher rated voltage but the
same capacity. The plates are made larger and kept farther apart.

As someone else stated this is also what electrolytics have such a wide
value range (+/- 20% or more). Voltage through the device changes its
geometry and its capacitance. (and its why they fail, the dielectric fluid
leaks out and they become short circuits)
