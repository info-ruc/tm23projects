Subject: Spurious IR signal
--text follows this line--

Dear IR users, 

I recently have begun experimenting with IR sensing for my HB by using
an IR led and a 3 pin detector (Everlight IRM8100-3-M available from
Radio Shack, cat no 276-137a). The LED is driven by a 38 KHz square
wave (50/50 duty cycle).  The detector has VCC, gnd and output, and is
low when it detects the 38KHz IR from the LED.    

The problem is that when it isn't detecting, the signal is not a 4 or
5 volt DC level as the spec indicates, but is an extremely unstable
noisy signal. I don't know much about the internals of the detector,
but I placed a 10k pullup resistor on the detector signal in case it is
an open collector output. This had no effect. 

Can anyone share a working circuit for this purpose?

Thank you , 

Ed Young
