Not going to mention the free Otto/Steven/Keith/Curt GCC-2.8.1 HC11 port?  
I'm hurt.   ;-)

Maybe you need to add my web & ftp pages to your free software page, now
that I have a GCC Handyboard library available?  GCC/HC11 patches are
available there too.

BTW:  Latest issue of Linux Journal (May 1999), page 88 has a nice article
written by a professor in England who's using an 811E2 board with GCC to
teach.  There's also Dr. Steven Barnicki at Michigan School of Engineering
using the DOS GCC compiler (DJGPP) and an HC11 board in the curriculum.

A friend just told me about an 8051 back-end to the GCC compiler as well,
and I'm trying to track down that link.  Perhaps we could get that one
combined with the HC11 back-end and have one set of sources for both
cross-compilers.
