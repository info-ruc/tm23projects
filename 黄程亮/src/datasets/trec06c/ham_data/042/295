Korytov                  Grounding issues (summary of 
                            the discussion with R. Shuvalov)	15'

On Friday afternoon we need to discuss the following: 
        - Yuri Bonushkin is organizing a discussion to refine the
          FNAL/CERN beam test schedule. Also, we need
          to overview the program of tests and priorities (for both
          discussions many of us are absolutely needed).
        - if ME1/2 design issues related to alignment, cooling and
          electronics board placement remain unresolved by the
          meeting, I suggest to take the opprtunity when everybody
          is present to discuss and make progress (Giorgio, Dick, Dave,
          TY, Tom are needed for this discussion). 
        - I suggest to have a discussion and form a strawman plan on HV
          training procedures and rejection criteria (Oleg)
