Generally, cost, accuracy, size, and drift. 

Ceramic caps are expensive ($/pf) reasonably stable across temperature and
acceptably accurate.

Electrolytic capacitors are cheap ($/pf) only moderately stable across
temperature changes, polarized, and not very accurate (+/- 30% is not uncommon)

Tantalum caps are an attempt to get lower cost like the electrolytic with
the accuracy and stability of ceramics. 

Other capactior technologies such as Mylar and Mica are used when very low
drift is required. 

There used to be an excellent discussion on capacitors in the ARRL handbook.
