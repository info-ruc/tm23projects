For all of you (2?) who have been anxiously awaiting the Handyboard
library for the GCC compiler:  It ain't ready yet.  :-(

Keith Hearn and myself have been working hard at different pieces of it,
and we're hoping to have a merged library sometime soon.

If anyone wants to help in this endeavor, perhaps testing out various
pieces of the library with real devices or writing new drivers, please
contact me.

The pieces that haven't been tested well are the stepper code, the DC
motor code, serial in, and the Dallas Semiconductor code.  There's no
servo code yet, but I may work on that this weekend.  The only sensor code
consists of generic analog/digital input routines. 

Pieces that appear to work:  Beeper, msleep, sleep, analog, digital,
motor, stepper, lcd low-level code, serial output, system timer interrupt. 

My code currently requires a bare handyboard with no expansion interface
and an E1/E9 processor (due to my current LCD code).

Keith is coding for a handyboard with an expansion interface and his code
doesn't have the restriction on the processor like mine does.

Once we combine the libraries it should work on darn near anything.
Contact me at both addresses to guarantee timely response.

Thanks,
