You misunderstood my point, or maybe I was not clear enough. I know the smooth PWM algorithm are available for I3.2. 

What I require is all the source code that's running on my handy board to be available. It's not the case for IC3.2, so I'm not using it. To be more precise I think the low-level routines should be available in source, I don't really care about the virtual machine.
