We just finished using the same comm. boards for our senior project,
so maybe I can help a little.

One interesting phenomenon we noticed was that we received random
noise at the receiver when the transmitter wasn't on.  However, when
the transmitter was powered up, the receiver was quite consistent--and
mostly noise-free.

That sounds along the right lines of thinking, but the problem to me
seems to be coordination.  You're going wireless to remove the direct
link, right?  But to use a pin from the Handyboard to enable only one
of the TX/RX pairs at a time would require a wire connection back to
the PC, true?

To me, it appears one of your more important issues is multiplexing
the serial line to/from the Handyboard/PC.  You didn't mention this in
your e-mail, but it seems fairly obvious, so perhaps the omission was
purely typographical.  Anyway, you'll need a mux somewhere to choose
between the serial line from the RX board and to the TX board.  (As
far as I know, anyway, IC can't transmit/receive on two different COM
ports on the PC, nor push/pull serial data from different sources on
the Handyboard.) 

Once you've established all the correct lines, voltage levels,
etc. (we had a hard time with this...), you'll need select lines for
the mux on each end.  Now, we didn't play with this, but I remember a
RSSI signal from the RX boards that, if I understand correctly, was
supposed to indicate a detected carrier--i.e. it's receiving
something.  It seems you should hook this up as the select line to
your mux.  That way the serial line defaults to transmit, but should
switch over to the RX board when it's receiving data.  You'll have to
check the documentation on the Linx boards, but this may be your
ticket.  

Incidentally, don't forget to use a null-modem cable between the Linx
boards and the Handyboard.  This simple oversight cost us (me) a great
deal of time and frustration.
