hi everyone,

i like to ask something on the PWM of the handboard.

if i only do a command:

motor(2,50);
motor(3,50);

i will get a smooth PWM of 500 Hz of waveform.( -_-_-_-_    something like
this)
but if i implement the above command into a program with start_process
function,
i will get irregular waveform( -__-_-_--__-__--_-  something like this )
and this affect my stepper motors badly.
when i check the waveform, i will get a addition delay of about 1-2 msec.
why is this so????
can anyone help????
by the way, my SCK/PD4 pin is faulty which if i set it as output and
bit_set it, i will get 5V. but if i bit_clear it, i will get 2.5V( i have
already poke the port ).  i like to know if the 68hc11 chip is being
affected in any way?

regards,
Michael
