Subject: first step in assembly of the handy board...
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm kinda new at this...Can anyone tell me what voltage I should be
checking with my multimeter(1000 or  200 or  200M etc..)?  I'm on the
first testing stage of the main assembly of the handy board and I get no
voltage and GND and +5v spot, also my led does not light.  I can't go
any further until I solve this problem. Can someone please help me?
