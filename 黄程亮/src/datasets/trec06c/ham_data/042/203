If it is the note I posted, also get the followup.  The initial post I
think I made a couple errors, and then someone said their chips got
hot :-o.  Anyway a followup post corrected the information.

If you look at the pinouts for the 293 chip, there are 2 h-bridges in
the single chip.  Using corresponding pins, you can connect 2
LM18200's to a single socket.  You should connect the corresponding
forward pin to the same 18200 as you connected the enable pin.  So
pins 1, 2 (or 7) are for one LM18200, and 9, 10 (or 15) are for the
other.  

Make sure you heat sink the LM18200, they will get hot unless they are
really lightly loaded.

Good luck
