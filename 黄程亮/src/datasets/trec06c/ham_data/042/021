Hello,

I've been very busy trying to communicate with the Handyboard via a wireless 
link ( HP Development kit form Linx Technologies). I have run into a slight 
problem-
The kit comes with 2 "development boards" - each contains a transmitter, 
receiver, and an antenna. Linx provides software to establish a simplex 
communication between 2 computers ( which means only one transmitter/ 
receiver pair are used at a time).
In order to communicate with the handyboard, I'll need ( I think ) at least a 
two way half duplex transmission protocol. Here is the problem: In the 
current set-up, all four Linx Tx/ Rx modules are enabled at the same time. 
They all transmit at the same frequency, which causes a problem. Data sent to 
the transmitter on "Board 1" is immediately picked up by the receiver on the 
same board, having a loop- back effect.
The problem can be solved by transmitting and receiving at two different 
frequencies, which is not too difficult, considering that Linx provides a dip 
switch to select between 8 different frequencies. Having explored this 
solution, however, I keep getting the following message whenever I try to run 
IC via the wireless link:
Looking for prompt, received 255
Synchronizing with Board....
The number "received" varies with each successive synchronization attempt.
So here is the question:
On the Handyboard side: Is it possible to somehow monitor a pin on the 68HC11 
to see whether it is transmitting or receiving? I plan to use this pin to 
enable only one Tx/ Rx pair at a time. (The Linx Tx/ Rx modules have a power 
down pin for this purpose).  
On the PC side: Could I use the DTR, CTS, and RTS serial pins to perform the 
same function?
I am confident that the wireless link works in the simplex mode, since I was 
able to transmit an analog audio signal from a Walkman to a Stereo! 
Any thoughts on the matter would be highly appreciated.
