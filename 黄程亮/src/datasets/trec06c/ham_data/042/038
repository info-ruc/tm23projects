I don't have the Ferrettronics chip datasheet in front of me but some off the
cuff calculations:

2400 bps/10 bits per byte=240 bytes per second
each servo will require at least 2 bytes (servo # and position)
16 servos * 2 = 32 bytes for each position update (if the protocol also has
a chip address then 16 * 3 = 48 bytes!)
if you can talk with 2 different chips simultaneously then 32/2=16 bytes per
update

240/32 = ~7 so your leg position updates will only happen every 1/7 second which
is pretty slow and the legs would move like driven by stepper motors (stop,
start, stop, start)

I think the ssc will communicate faster than 2400 bps so updates can happen
faster.

You should be able to run from the same battery as long as to drop the voltage
down to about 6V but definately be sure to use the same ground or the servos
won't operate correctly. If you do decide to use separate batteries make sure
the grounds are also connected.
