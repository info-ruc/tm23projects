Phillip,

This happened to me once, and it was because I had an electrolytic capacitor
installed backwards.  You obviously have something drawing a lot of current,
so if you check the caps and everything looks ok, it is somewhere else.
Lacking any better method, try placing your finger on each component and find
what else is getting hot besides the voltage regulator.  If that doesn't turn
up anything, take out all the IC's and anything else you can unplug and start
testing again as you replace things until the problem repeats.  That will
probably lead to the problem.

Remember, this is supposed to be FUN!

Best Regards,

Gary Livick
