Hi all,
 I'm currently putting together a handyboard system, and my question is, can
I simply use a 12v sealed lead acid battery in place of the 9.6v rechargable
pack? I know that the interface board won't be able to charge the SLA, but
apart from this will the board work ok? The reason I'm doing this is to run
12v motors properly.
  Thanks.
