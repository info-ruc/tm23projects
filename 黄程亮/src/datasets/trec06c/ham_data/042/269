We're going to do some research on the racks themselves.  APC makes rack
enclosures I believe.  Usually, the racks are about as wide as the case
itself.  I haven't seen any that are 2 wide.   The standard rack
enclosure holds a single column of systems, routers, etc.

Let me get the facts straight and I will get back in touch with you
ASAP.

Joey
