Hi all,

There are a group of kids coming to visit the lab this Thursday for whom
I'm trying to set up some demos.  Please let me know if you would be
available to show something or whether this might interfere with any other
scheduled event.  Further details follow :  

>The kids are from SPES (Supplementary Program of Educational Skills). 
>My understanding right now is that there would be about 15 kids (all
>boys).  They are 12-13 years old and in the 5-6 grade and are mostly
>from the Dorchester area.  Tim Crimmins, an MIT student is organizing
>the day.  I believe that they are coming this thursday at about  10 and
>leaving about 2.
>
>SPES is a voluntary program that runs after school and on weekends. 
>Discipline, athletics, respect, music(most students play an
>instrument), art, reading, and academics are stressed.  Currently
>several MIT students help as tutors on the weekends.

Thanks,
Tammy
