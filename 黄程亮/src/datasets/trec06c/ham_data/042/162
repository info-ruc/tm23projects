      STOCK WATCH - OIL AND GAS

      COMPANY DESCRIPTION

      Everyone knows that Oil & Gas investments are the hottest thing around at the moment. With crude floating at over $70 per barrel range, increased conflict in oil rich regions, and ever escalating prices at the pump, it's safe to say that where there's oil, there's money. The toughest question is; which oil and gas play to pick? The answer is to go where the money goes, because the money knows which oil and gas plays offer the most return for the least dollar 

      Biogenerics Limited is a diversified investment venture capital firm and our shares are quoted on (OTC:BIGN); our principal business is focused on exploiting and distributing domestic oil and gas reserves. The domestic fuel market is presently estimated to exceed $10 billion. Biogenerics Ltd. is the money that follows the most attractive oil and gas opportunities. There focus is joint ventures with domestic oil and gas reserve companies on joint ventures like Tyche Energy, Hydorslotter Corp. and WW Energy Inc. 

      MARKET OPPORTUNITY & RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

      Sparked by the Company's recent strategic milestones with Tyche Energy and its Charing Cross gas reserves with Hydro Slotter Corp. and its enhanced oil recovery techniques, along with a number of other opportunities that possess the potential to generate immediate revenue in this arena, our goal is to maximize investment value in the short term and enhance shareholders' equity in the long-term.

      Biogenerics Ltd. (OTC:BIGN) announces that Tyche Energy Inc. advises it has completed construction of the production facilities and sales gas pipeline at its Charring Cross property located in Harwich Township, Kent County, Ontario. The production facilities process sour gas from the RPI#7 Harwich 1-1-18-IV WCR well and deliver sweet gas via a 2.1 kilometer sales gas pipeline to a meter site tied into the Union Gas Limited pipeline system. 

      The RPI#7 well reached a stabilized flow rate of 465 MCFD during the initial production test. Production will commence at a rate of approximately 100 MCFD and will be increased gradually to a daily rate of 200 MCF. Independent industry price forecasts project the price of gas to average between CDN$11.65 and $12.67/MCF in 2006.

      Biogenerics Limited (OTC:BIGN) announced the location of its new head office, which will be relocated to 1520 Rice Road, Suite 200, Tyler, Texas, 75703. Not only is the Tyler head office an indicator of Biogenerics growing presence in the oil and gas industry, it also a reflection of the company's growth strategy which focuses on the employment of its strategic partners proprietary technology, such as Hydroslotter Corporation's enhanced oil recovery techniques in existing wells.
