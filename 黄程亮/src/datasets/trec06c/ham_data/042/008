Well my code does make constant calls to printf() and motor() (although
with the original PWM code)=2E   I did notice the jitters more on the low end=2E=20=


now I've put aside the head rotation and sonar routines and will start
on the encoders=2E  I am interested in using the servo as a head mounted
sensor platform in order to perform tracking=2E  The idea is that by
sweeping the head a sensor map (sonar, pyro, beacon) is created and a
heading is chosen=2E  Does anyone know of a good resource for the types
of algolrythms involved in sensor mapping=2E=2E=2E
Thanks for the reply,
-Drew

My HB is totally new, and I also have the "jitters"=2E  However, I have never
Zap charged the unit=2E  Although when we observed the jitters we were
excessievly calling printf()=2E=2E=2E  We more promenently noticed the jitters
when
running 2 9V motors (with smooth PWM code)=2E  The jitters only occures
in the
range 20 - 30=2E=2E=2E You can probably best notice this by using the knob to
set
the PWM rate of the motors directly=2E=2E=2E
