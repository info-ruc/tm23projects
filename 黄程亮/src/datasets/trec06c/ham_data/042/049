Summary
=======

1. Committee Reports

   Financial, Academic and Research Committee
   ==========================================

   (Formerly the "Funding Committee".  Their new e-mail is far@gso.bu.edu.)

   Gareth Roberts <garethr@math.bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   - They're still working on a set of guidelines for advising at BU.

   - Their speaker for a talk on "Intellectual Property" still hasn't
     committed to a date, so they expect the talk may have to be deferred
     until the Fall.

   ----

   They also wanted to call attention to 2 conferences: Harvard recently
   had a teleconference on "Grad Student Mentoring" and COCAL will be
   having a conference on "Academic Labor" (including grad students).
   Contact far@gso.bu.edu for more info about either of those.

   Healthcare Committee
   ====================

   Rob Pitts <rip@cs.bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   The committee's talk on "Student Healthcare" (4/6/99) went well:

   - 18 students attended.  These seemed to be mainly (or all) grads
     even though undergraduates were invited as well.  Students asked
     many of the questions that were discussed as important at previous
     general meeting.  Committee members asked those questions not
     covered by other students.

   - An additional representative from Student Health Services, their
     Associate Director, attended as well (giving 2 representatives
     from Student Health Services and 1 from Chickering).

   - Ads for the talk made it into both the Bridge and the Daily Free
     Press (DFP), but they both misprinted the date of the talk (see
     topic 3 below about how Bridge announcements end up in the DFP).

   Currently, they are working on:

   - Writing up the questions and answers from the talk.  These will
     be placed on the Healthcare Pages (http://gso.bu.edu/healthcare/).

   - Finishing up a few write-ups that were deferred while organizing
     the Healthcare talk.

   Housing Committee
   =================

   Both committee members will be taking qualifying exams this weekend,
   so they did not report.

   Liaison Committee
   =================

   Gary Garber <ggarber@buphy.bu.edu> reported for this committee by e-mail.

   - Although GRS doesn't want to do a BBQ for the Fall new student
     reception (recall that this is due to it being ruined if there is
     bad weather), they are willing to do a BBQ as a separate grad
     social event in the Fall or Spring.

   - We cannot place the NAGPS insurance plan flyer (they have a 1-page
     flyer that promotes the plan) in mailings to new students.  GRS's
     main concern is that it would seem as if GRS was endorsing the
     NAGPS plan, and since there isn't a formal financial relationship
     between NAGPS and BU, they don't seem too keen on the idea.  GRS
     says we can hand out info on the NAGPS plan at our table at the
     Fall reception and we may be able to mention the plan in our own
     GSO flyer (which we can include in mailings).

   Social Committee
   ================

   Cassandra Celatka <celatka@chem.bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   April's Social event will be billiards at Boston Billiards:

   - It will be on Wednesday, April 28th, 6:30pm

   - Pool tables go for approximately $8/hour, HOWEVER, since Wednesday
     is "Ladies Night", the cost is reduced by 25% for each woman at a
     table (so >= 4 women makes that table free).

   - Students should be able to pay for their drinks as they order them
     or can probably run tabs if they like.

   - They are not yet sure what money we will get for snacks (from GRS)
     and what we will be able to purchase.

   Steering Committee
   ==================

   Dave Morgan <dmorgan@math.bu.edu> and Jen Wenner <wenner@bu.edu>
   reported for this committee.  Their report consisted of a
   presentation/discussion of the articles in the "Constitution,
   Bylaws, etc." section below.

2. Constitution, Bylaws, etc.

   The Steering Committee is leaving some extra time for students to
   comment on the "Committees of the GSO" article (since the text of
   Part I is new).  The "Officers of the GSO" article is essentially
   done, but students have a little more time to comment on that as
   well.

   The main discussion concerned the "Department Representatives"
   article.  Out of that discussion, the need for a "Meetings" article
   became apparent.  One member suggested having 2 kinds of meetings, a
   regular general meeting where committees report (and where Dept.
   Reps. are welcome) and "special meetings" called when issues need to
   be discussed (at which Dept. Reps. would be required to attend).

   Remember to send your comments on articles (that have already been
   sent out by e-mail) to steering@gso.bu.edu.

3. Advertising in BU Newspapers

   The Healthcare Committee provided some additional information on
   this based on their experience with the "Student Healthcare" talk:

   Bridge
   ------
   Event announcements in the Bridge are published on Friday's.
   According to their secretary, you need to send in the announcement
   the Friday before the publication date (in some cases, you can
   get away with the Monday before the publication date).  Sending the
   announcement via calendar@bu.edu seems to work fairly well.

   They do edit your announcement text (you may want to submit and
   verify ads over the phone (at 353-2752) if you are concerned about
   how they will edit your ad).  To that end, they currently only list
   phone numbers for "more info" on an event.  They do not list e-mails
   (although the secretary said she'd ask the editor about possibly
   changing that after we requested it).  Those submitting event
   announcements should first look at the format used for announcements
   in the Bridge, to make sure all the usual information is provided.

   Event announcements in the Bridge are also listed on BU's web site
   (http://www.bu.edu/calendar/) (under one of several categories).
   These announcements are sometimes also automatically placed in the
   Daily Free Press' announcements page (more about Daily Free Press
   listings at a future meeting).
