Hi,

I'm building a mobile robot using an R/C car with an Electronic Speed 
Controller (ESC) as the mobile platform, the Handyboard for sensorial data 
aquisition, and servo control; and a Linux "box" for GPS, videoconferencing, 
wireless communications, high level autonomous behavior, and remote control...

My question is...

How much are the GPS, the ultrasound radar, the electronic compass, the 
stepper motor (that holds and rotates a "turret" containing the ultrasound 
transducer, the video camera, some IR sensors, and eventually a Laser 
range-finder), the servo motors (that control the car), the video camera (I'm 
NOT using a wireless video transmitter), the ESC, and the packet modem going 
to cause electromagnetic interference to each other?  Should I expect any 
other type of interference ? Which devices are not gonna be affected or cause 
any type of interference ? Which devices generate interference, and what are 
my options accessing the problem ?

Wow! If someone is able to answer all that, we should post the answers in some 
FAQ...:)

Thank you in advance for any help...

Best,

Andre.
