hi, i am currently trying to interface the vector 2x compass with the
handyboard given the info and code provided on the handyboard web page.  i
am having 2 problems with it.

1)  occasionally the compass doesn't produce a clock signal until i reset
it a couple of times.  any thoughts?

2)  it seems to be inaccurate by plus or minus 20 degrees.  what i have
found is that 360 degrees is actually 360 degrees, but 90 degrees doesn't
usually come up as 90 degrees. (i have the compass on a protyping board,
and position it with the tiles on the floor to try and get 90 degrees)
what happens is that the error alternates every quadrant.  so odd
quadrants might be minus 20 degrees, but even ones plus 20 degrees.

has anyone come across these problems?  if so how did you fix them, if you
did.  i am open to any suggestions.  thanks in advance.

yono
