Patch 1.2 to the GCC/HC11 compiler is now available on my FTP site:

 	ftp.eskimo.com/u/a/archer/hc11-patch-latest.tar.gz

This new patch includes the patches by Otto Lind, Dr. Steven Barnicki,
Keith Hearn, and myself.  It is patch 1.2.

Also, I put the latest snapshot of my GCC Handyboard library up there.
Check it out if you want, but I'm still working on it.  Expect quite
a few more library updates.

Curt, WE7U.
