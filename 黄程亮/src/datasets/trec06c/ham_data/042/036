Hello,

I am planning to build a robot based on the Lynxmotion Hexapod II
and Big Grip kits. There will be 12 servos for lego control, 2 
servos for the manipulator, and 2 more for a camera pan/tilt 
unit. Everything appears fairly straightforward, but:

1) I am trying to decide on whether to use two mini SSCs or the
   Ferrettronics chips to control the servos. Does anyone have 
   any info/experience that might sway me one way or the other?
   Is anyone aware of documentation or tips for using either 
   of these with the handy board?

2) I am wondering if I can run the servos from the handy board
   batteries or if I need to have a separate battery pack for 
   the servos. Obviously the HB batteries won't last very long
   if they are also running 16 servos, but would this work?

TIA,
Doug
