I have started working on an expansion board version of the compass
code. I won't have it done before fall probably (unless is snows or
something really bad). I am involved in another huge project right
now.

My thoughts are to have the compass in slave mode again, then do a
manual clocking of the data in. I would connect more of the compass
pins to the expansion board pins (reset, calibrate, etc). 

If anyone thinks of a better way to do this, go for it.
