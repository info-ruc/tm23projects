It's hard to believe, but Herb has agreed to pay all of the $45,589
matching money that you need to purchase your computer cluster.  Move your
orders forward as quickly as you want!  Congratulations, and please let
Herb know how much you appreciate his support.  We want to encourage
similar behavior in the future....  David
