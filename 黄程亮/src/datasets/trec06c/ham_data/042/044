Hello all,

I want to power some twelve volt gearmotors (The kind currently available
from Acroname) with the H board without extensively (or permanently)
modifiying the H board.

My plan is to use some MOSFETS that have a low voltage gate threshold and
attach one each to the various motor outputs (one each for two motors).

I plan to attach an external 12v, 2 amp gel-cell battery to my gearmotors
through the MOSFETS. The motor-out lines from the H board will have a diode,
a current limiting resistor and will finally attach to the gate on the
MOSFET. The ground from the external 12v battery will be common with the H
board. Each motor will have two MOSFET circuits attached with opposing
polarity to give forward and reverse.

The existing PWM and driver circuit will then drive the MOSFET which will
then switch the motor on and off as if it were directly connected to the
motor output.

Will this work?? My electronics experience is limited and I don't really
want to spend the money on H bridge kits that may or may not interface
easily with the H board.

I would appreciate any comments, no matter how scathing.

Thanks.
