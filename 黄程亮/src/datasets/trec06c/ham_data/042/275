This cabinet will house 10 rackmountable systems.  It is from the same
company that distributes the rackmount cases.  They have a brochure they
faxed us and it shown with the actual case that we use.  It looks good.
Now, you mentioned a UPS back up.  Do you want this to be rackmountable
as well?  If you do, you will need more than 1 cabinet.  I'm not
positive about the Cisco switch we were discussing but, you can get the
UPS in the rackmount form and put the 10 systems in one cabinet and put
the UPS's, routers, switches, etc in the other.  You may want to ask
JLAB how they have their's arranged.

10 Unit Rackmount Cabinet
$1821.00  includes shipping 300lbs to Newport News VA.
