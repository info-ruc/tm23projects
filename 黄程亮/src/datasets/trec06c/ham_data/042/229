yes, this is right.

the fastest you can go with the 52-pin 6811s is 12 MHz crystal --> 3 MHz 
system clock (i'm pretty sure).  so this is only 1.5x over the stock HB.

so you've got the issue Curt pointed out with not only the downloader, 
but also with IC.  

so unless you're willing to work from the source code of these tools, to 
deal with the baud rate issue, basically, you're wedged.

in my opinion:  1.5x speedup = lots of hassle = not worth it.

if you need more speed, write in assembly (maybe using IC's ICB 
interface), or use ImageCraft's icc11 (www.imagecraft.com) native C 
compiler.  OR, give a try to Kurt Konolige's "IC Native" port of the 
freeware Interactive C.  see
