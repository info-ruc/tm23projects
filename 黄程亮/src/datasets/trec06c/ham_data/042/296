TO WINNERS IN OUR PROGRAM 
we wish to congratulate you over your success in our computer balloting
sweepstake held on 30th April, 2006. 

 

This is a millennium scientific computer game in which email addresses were

address was attached to ticket number 10CBG3471913; with serial number 19034
draw the lucky numbers 1-9-74-31, which eventually won the lottery in the
first category of the draws. This entitled to a cash award of US$ 2,
500,000.00 (TWO MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS). 

                                                                           
        

This is from total prize money of US$30,000,000.00  distributed to winners
from 1st to 3rd categories.  Note that this program was largely promoted and
sponsored by a group of philanthropist, industrialists from the internet
ware industry and >some 
other big multinational firms who wish to be anonymous.
