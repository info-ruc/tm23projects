yes, as long as you are running  a rfc compliant smtp server .. (at least
I'm fairly sure that Bcc is in the rfc.if it's not, well, flame me to a
crisp :) I'm too lazy to go check it myself) if you don't understand the
first sentence, then don't worry about it, the answer is most likely yes
(like in 99.99999% of the cases I know of..) If you're a really paranoid
sort, test it by Bcc'ing yourself about four times and look at the
headers, if you don't see it, no one else will.
