Cliff,
Contrary to the message from your MTA, the so-called "group" syntax
  foo: ;
is valid, i.e., is compliant with the standard... but not all MTAs
accept it.

Two choices: upgrade your MTA or replace the To: address with any
conventional (non "group") address.  Don't leave the To: field blank or
some (other) MTAs will add an "Apparently-To" line for each recipient.
