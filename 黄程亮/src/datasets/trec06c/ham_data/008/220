[rest of error message]

is it possible that the separator (semicolon, isn't it) is wrong? I've
just had a look into the tech-notes:

The address field takes one of two forms, depending on whether the entry is a
single (simple) address or a distribution list. For a simple entry, the
address field is the email-address part of the address, i.e., the part that
goes inside the brackets (<>). It is combined with the fullname field to form
the complete address. For a distribution list, the <address> is in the format:

          "(" <address>, <address>, <address>, ... ")"

just a guess, norbert.
