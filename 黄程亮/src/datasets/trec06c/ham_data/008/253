In addition to previous responses regarding Pine folder collections, you
might also want to consider defining multiple *incoming* folders, so that
it is easy to check for new mail in them simply by using the TAB command
to automatically cycle through them from the INDEX screen.  (Pine will 
stop and open the folder only if there are new/interesting messages
in it.)

To do this, first, set the "enable-incoming-folders" feature, then use the
ADD dialog in the folder collection screen, OR edit your pinerc to have
something like:

incoming-folders=STATUS {shivams.cac.washington.edu}status,
	IMAP {shivams.cac.washington.edu}imap,
	ACAP {shivams.cac.washington.edu/user=gray}acap,
	PINE-INFO {shivams.cac.washington.edu:145}pine-info,
	SMIME {shivams.cac.washington.edu:145/user=gray}smime,
	CompMailPine {shivams.cac:145}{news.u.washington.edu/nntp}#news.comp.mail.pine,

Note that in my case above, I have different kinds of messages vectored
into different folders on the same server; that's done by a delivery
filtering too (e.g. procmail), but you might have different kinds
of messages going to different servers... 

Also note that the last line above assumes the latest UW IMAP server,
which will proxy between an IMAP client and an NNTP server.  That won't
work with earlier UW IMAP servers.
