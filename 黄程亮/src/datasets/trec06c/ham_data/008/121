	We seem to have a problem and we're not sure how it came about, 
and even less sure about how to fix it.
	We were using our board to drive our robot.  At this point we had 
a simple program, both motors on full forever.  We turned the board on, 
the Display went completely black, then started clearing from left to 
right.  We turned off the board, turned it back on, and the same symptoms 
occured.  It only cleared to about the half way point.  We assumed the 
battery was dead, so we let it charge over night.  This morning we turned 
on the board, the LCD was completely blank.   We downloaded pcode_hb.s19 
successfully according to the downloader.  We turn on the board, the LCD 
is still blank, the green power LED is lit, and the board will not 
respond when we attempt to run interactive'c'. 
	We are pretty much at a loss right now.  Any help/advise you can 
give would be greatly appreciated.
					Thank You
