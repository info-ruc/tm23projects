I haven't seen the schematic you're refering to but I believe you can use
the +5V bus already on a standard HB. Just connect your PWR/GND to one of
those headers "below" one of the A/D inputs. I did this before and it
worked. Apparrently, the 1A +5V regulator can handle the 2A surges the
sensor loads.
