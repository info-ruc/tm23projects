well, it's sort of fictitious. I got something like that to work on my
machine.

I have four email boxes

INBOX /var/spool/mail/drachen
{mail1.eni.net}abuse
{mail1.eni.net}drachen
IN.testing /home/drachen/mail/IN.testing

It sorta works. It requires much going in and out of pine. I'm working on
refining now.
