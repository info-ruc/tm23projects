Well, no, I said "e.g. procmail"... that is "for example, procmail".  As
it happens, I don't use procmail myself (I use a user+folder@foo.bar
addressing convention), but I believe many do use procmail successfully
with IMAP, and I don't understand what the problem would be FOR SITES THAT
PERMIT SHELL OR NFS ACCESS TO THE IMAP SERVER and use the normal Unix
mailbox format.

For sites that don't meet the above test, the general problem of
user-controlled delivery filtering in a black-box, client-server
environment is, I think, still unsolved.  It's on our local list of email 
issues, but hasn't gotten much attention yet.

I believe some IMAP clients actually do pseudo-delivery filtering when
they start up by applying rules to the messages in the INBOX and stuffing
them back into different server folders according to those rules.   We've
resisted going down that path in Pine, because it is obviously less
efficient than doing delivery filtering all on the server at the time
messages arrive --but the client-based approach is a pragmatic work-around
to the lack of any standards or infrastructure for "doing it right".

So... could you clarify the problem you are interested in?
