>How do I upload a file?

If Z-Modem is available to you, use that. The sending side always invokes it
using "sz" and calling "rz" on the receiving side. You must closely examine the
communications program that you use to see what you have available.

Kermit is also commonly available, but it's more difficult to use.

It sounds like portions of the "help" file are missing. Complain to your system
administrator, and ask him to install the current pine, now at 3.96.
