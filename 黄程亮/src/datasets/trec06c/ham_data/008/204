Subject: procmail or slocal?

I am trying to decide if I have to install procmail on my system or just use
slocal to make auto-responders.
The informations I've found so far have been rather cryptic and none mention
anything about auto-responders.
I'd rather try to get slocal to do it right now since it's already installed and
space is a bit limited for now.
Could anyone help with some pointers on how to setup slocal to handle
auto-responders?
