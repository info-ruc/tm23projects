Hello,

I'm trying to outfit a Motorola 68HC12 evaluation board as a handyboard
robot controller. Since Randy Sargeant's Handyboards' use the 68H11
(which is source-code compatible with the 'H12), I'd like to share
information with people who've done the conversion or are planning to.

Of course, any sort of advice (on the foolhardiness of this undertaking,
etc.) is more than welcome. :)
 
(Why did I buy the 'H12 board in the first place? -- Well, Motorola's  
selling it cheap for their design contest.  See
http://mot-sps.com/contest/ for details)

Regards,
- Sonam Chauhan
