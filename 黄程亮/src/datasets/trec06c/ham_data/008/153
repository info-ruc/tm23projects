Hi

I've ported the changes (Julian Skidmore's mod) to the IC 3.1 pcode source code: 
(available from ftp://newtonlabs.com/pub/pcode/pcode31.exe)

But I don't have anywhere outside a corporate firewall to put the files (a new
pcode_hb.s19 and a modified lib_hb.c file - 27k in all) !

I'm also concerned about putting modified copyrighted files on the net, without
getting permission from the copyright owner....

I've cc'd this message to Randy Sargent of Newtonlabs - If Randy says it's OK
then I'll forward the files to Fred for inclusion on the HandyBoard WWW site.

Scott
