There is a header called "Bcc," which stands for "Blind Carbon Copy" that
you can use for that.  You can get the header to appear by selecting the
"Rich Headers" command while editing anything in the header section of
your message (IE while typing in the Subject)  The command for rich
headers should be listed at the bottom of your screen while in these
sections.  If you can't find the command, just keep looking.. It's there.
Whatever addresses you put in the Bcc field will recieve the message, but
will not see the other recipients of it.
