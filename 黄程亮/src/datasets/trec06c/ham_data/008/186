The target filament for observations on the 20th erupted between
04:00 and 06:03 UT on the 21st.  Accordingly a new target has
been selected for the 22nd and 23rd.  It is a filament located at
S08E08 at 09:52 UT on the 21st.  VLA observations are from
14:03-20:03 UT on the 22nd when the darkest part of the filament
should be located at S08W07.  

Unless it erupts, the same target is planned to be the target
on Jan. 23 when VLA observations will occur from 15:00 UT to
21:00 UT.  

Note collaborative observations outside of VLA observing
periods are of value as the observations taken on the 21st
during the eruption hopefully will show.  

We plan to issue target information for the final observions
of the 26th on the preceeding day.
