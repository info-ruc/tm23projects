Scott,

Thanks for incorporating Julian's changes into the 3.1 pcode.

In fact, if we can have Julian's permission and yours as well, Scott, we'd
be very interested to be able to redistribute the improved pcode with IC
3.1.

Scott and Julian, would this be OK?  If so, please contact me and I'll set
up for you to FTP the file here.

Thanks!

-- Randy
