In addition to the other messages, which were helpful, it should also be
pointed out that VSNL has not seen fit to upgrade their version of pine.
You are using version 3.91 which is "old".  Pine is now at 3.96 which
offers the ability to so file uploads and downloads from within pine.

IMHO, a lot of the problems are created by VSNL.  They are a government
run ISP and they give little or no service to their customers....
