I have a mime message in my E-mail and have no idea how to convert it into MS 
format.  I have info re. the decoder ect. however, I have no idea on how to 
get my hands on it.  I do not know how to get the stuff out of 
ftp.andrew.cmu.edu.   When I search the web using that address I get not 
found.  Please help me get on the right track or point me to a place I can.
Thanks
Jim White
