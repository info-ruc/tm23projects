Dear Sirs,

I have one question: Is it possible using Pine 3.96, if one composes a
message to a distribution list, that means to several different addresses,
to send this message in one step in such a way that any receiver of the
message cannot read in the hader who else has got the same message? If
this is not possible I would like to make the suggestion to allow this
option in future versions of pine.

With my best regards,

Ulf Winkler, Leipzig, Germany
