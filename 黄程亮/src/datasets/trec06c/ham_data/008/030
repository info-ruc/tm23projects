Subject: cannot print from filemaker pro

Hi,
My problem is simple :
It is impossible to print from filemaker pro 4.0
I've already reinstalled my drivers, I've already changed all my
settings to European standards namely A4 papersize but nothing works.
There is no problem if I want to print from another application.
Is there somebody who knows what could be my problem.
Thank you for helping me.
