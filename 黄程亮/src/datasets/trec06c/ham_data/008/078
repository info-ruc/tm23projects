Well I'd sure like $35,000 to buy two DEC Alpha 4x600MHX processor
Screamers, a T3, routers, two name servers and a big chair to sit back and
look at all of it humming away!
You have reached a mailing list devoted exclusively to the email program
known as PINE. Most of us on this list are penniless (maybe not Ed, he works
for a "Big Company") and whatever our financial status, this isn't the place
to hunt for entrepeneurial start-up capital.
Sorry we can't be of any help whatsoever, but Good Luck with your search!
-Colin.
