Hi (Hallo :-),

 UW> With my best regards,

That was in comp.mail.pine yesterday ... while composing a message
move the cursor into the header region and press ctrl-r (rich
header). Then write the list of addressees into the field Bcc: (blind
carbon copy) and noone will know who else has got the message (even if
all header options are on, as has been stated in the other thread).

l8er, norbert.
