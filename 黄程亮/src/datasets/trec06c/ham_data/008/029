I'm not gonna touch this one! I s'pose it's no good telling the individual
that if you don't visit 'em in the beginning, chances are (these days
anyway) you won't get unsolicited mail. <sigh> Please excuse me fellow
list members, I have this great 'pic of Daisy (The cloned sheep)  ohhhh,
those lips, that wool...er....I have to go to the bathroom...later all
<pant>
