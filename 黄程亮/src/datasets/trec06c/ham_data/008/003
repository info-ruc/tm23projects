Hi,

I'm a guitarist/singer/songwriter/guitar synthesist looking for other
musicians to form a band and eventually tour and record CD's with. 

I have been playing for nearly 25 years in some form of a band or another and
am now in my mid 30's. I have a wide range of styles and influences 
although some of the music I write reflects a heavy fast paced rock style.
Some of my recent favorites are STP, Foo Fighters, Soundgarden....I even
like a few of the songs off the new Smashmouth album.....you name it. 
If there is a guitar playing through a Marshall it's my cup of tea. 

I should mention that I do like most styles of music and my writing suggests a
very broad range of styles from Jazz and Swing to the heaviest metal you can
imagine. I consider myself pretty versatile.

I have quite a collection of necessary equipment including PA and mixer and a
studio where I can play 24 hours a day 7 days a week with no neighbor
complaints. No more $350.00 a month lockouts.

I live in Missouri at present but am considering moving to Nashville or
another city that has a good rock and music scene.I've played in bands that
have opened for Creedence Clearwater, Three Dog Night, Blood Sweat & Tears,
just to name a few and have ties and experiences back to my home state of
California with other bands as well. I left the Orange County music scene in
1996 and moved to Missouri since not alot of bands were getting anywhere in
the LA scene (you know...the pay to play scene).

So I appeal to you at this moment in time to consider starting/joining 
a fellow musician who is extremely serious about getting somewhere in the
music scene. I would like to start off with getting a good solid drummer 
and bassist and eventually add another guitar player as well as a front 
man. I have about 20 original songs ready to play as well as an extensive
list of cover tunes ranging form 1958 to present.

I currently have a manager who takes care of all personel functions of the
band (past and present) as well as does all the bookings for the band and
other bands as well. (But this band is the main concern!)  This leaves the
band free to work on music - that's all we will ever have to worry about.

As far as upcoming gigs and performances....I (we including you) have several
opportunities to play this upcoming year in a number of large outdoor
festivals but I sure can't do it without you or the other players. 

If you are interested in finding out more please send e-mail to this e-mail
address: OSIRISMGR@AOL.COM   -  this is the managers e-mail address.
The manager can answer any questions you may have or forward a background on
myself to include a resume. I don't spend any more time on the computer than I
really have to

Thank you for taking time to read this and hopefully you will want to get 
started on a band that will definately get someplace. Or maybe you will know
someone to fit the bill to pass this on to. All help appreciated and may
whatever project or band you are in and don't want to leave - succeed.



Sincerely,

Gary
