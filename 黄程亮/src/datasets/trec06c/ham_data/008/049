If you want them, save them in your home directory, or on your machine at home. 
It's off topic, but someone may advise you on what to use for viewing if you
provide details of file formats. You could check the archives.

You will have to discuss with your system administrator what format mail will
be stored in. pine doesn't use proprietary formats.

Is your university eliminating Unix shell accounts? Really, we cannot know what
is in the mind of your system administrator. You must make further enquiries.
