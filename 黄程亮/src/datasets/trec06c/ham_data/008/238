>This system is very user-unfriendly, but I am stuck with it.

Try the context-sensitive help. There is a help topic for every function and
option, and each header in the composer. Just hit ^g.

>Please tell me how to attach a WORD file to a message that I am composing?

If you are using Unix pine via a shell account, upload the file to your home
directory. Enter the composer, put cursor in headers, ^j and name the file to
attach, fill in rest of headers, write an explanation in the body, send
message.
