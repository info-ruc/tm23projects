I suppose by system you mean WinBlows XX, because who else would try
to attach a WORD document?

Anyway, while composing a message, press ctrl-j (attach file) and
either enter the name of the file or press ctrl-t (to files) in order
to get a directory tree which you can use to search for the file.

Btw, the pine online-help is *very* well written and able to answer
your question right away, afaik. Also it's a good idea to look for the
options, presently given.

I hope this is *not* offending and I haven't missed any details.

l8er, norbert.
