Dear Sirs/Madams:
	Sometimes, I receive e-mail with attachments and cannot read 
them.  I am prompted by the Pine system to save them.  Where should I 
save them?  How can I read attachments, especially image files?

	The Pine system is going to phase out in my university for an
unknown reason.  Is there a way to forward my e-mail in the Pine system 
to my new e-mail address which is not in the Pine system?

	Thank you.

Sincerely,

Kin Man Choi
