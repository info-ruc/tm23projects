"Disk Quota Exceeded" means that the storage disk that pine normally writes
to is currently full, in this case, your account has been filled to
capacity.  You'll have to delete files that you no longer need to make room
for new files.  Since your storage disk is filled, you cannot save your
configuration file for PINE, and if the Fcc-Folder is set to a file in your
directory, you cannot save any files.
