Hi

I don't have any objection to putting the modified files up for general
download - I only added Julian's code to the 3.1 source...

I also modified the "boot" message so that it is obvious that you are running
the new PWM code. I've changed the IC version definition to print:
"IC 3.1 SMOOTHPWM"

If you like I can send the modified pcode.asm and Makefile to Newtonlabs for
inclusion in the next version of IC (or diff's if you would prefer).

I've tested the new s19 file and can't find any anomalies, and the change in
motor control really does work (thanks Julian !).

Scott
