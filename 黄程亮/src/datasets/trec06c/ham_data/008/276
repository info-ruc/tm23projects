You're not using pine. What's "MS format"? What are you doing here?

Try the Microsoft hotline. They're brilliant technicians with a very
good reputation all over the world. In fact they're about the best
makers of software and hotlines there ever were. Where else do you
want to go today?

Robin: You are a rude twit. (Sam Trenholme)


I can agree with you Sam.  For your information Robin MS is known to stand for 
Microsoft and I'm using the Works 4.0 application.
One thing you should always remember Robin, is that you should not forget you 
friends on the way up because you will most likely need them on the way down.
Thanks for at least responding I'll not trouble you any longer and I'll share 
your helpfulness with those I know.
