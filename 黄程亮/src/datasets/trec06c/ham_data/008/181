sounds to me like your computer and printer are not configured to talk to
eachother properly. Your best bet would probably be to get your local
techie type person to get computer and printer talking. Once that happens,
it's likely that you will be able to print out of pine correctly.

Meanwhile, try the {E}xport command. It saves paper :)
