 I created a distribution list using pine, ( an e-mail list). I would like
to know if there is anyway i can hide the addresses of the mailing list.
So when i send out a list every address is not exposed to the recipients.
Is there a hide option I can use ? Any info would be great !!

Thanks 
Chris Sacco
