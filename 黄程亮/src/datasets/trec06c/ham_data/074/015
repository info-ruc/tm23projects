   The PIO-12 has switch settings to change it's base I/O address and that 
is the only way to change it address -- no settings in the BIOS or anywhere 
other than TimeDX need to be changed.  It comes configured by default at 
ports 300-303, if you're in fact using 310 someone must have changed the 
switches at least once.  Remember that you need to tell TimeDX's PIO test 
the new address.  Windows will never recognize the device and doesn't need 
to, my machines tend to list it as a broken serial device.
