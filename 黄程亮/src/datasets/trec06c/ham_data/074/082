   Oh yeah, there's another thing you can do to decrease the sound latency 
variability, but IIRC that only affects variability when DMDX plays sounds, 
the TimeDX tests are not affected by this.  That is to increase the 
priority of the sound thread, there's a discussion of it somewhere, 
probably TimeDX help file.  Be warned, increasing the sound thread priority 
decreases retrace tracking accuracy, it's a direct trade off, either the 
code is paying attention to playing sounds or it's tracking the retrace, 
can't do both at once.  I would imagine with later day machines and the CPU 
cycles available on them that you can increase the sound thread priority 
without penalty as long as the percentage of timed out retraces is really low.
