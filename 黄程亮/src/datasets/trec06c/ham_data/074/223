Hi Pamela et al.,

Actually I did get it to work.  For the information of others who are
having the problem, I had the video mode set to the wrong setting.  I
was under the incorrect assumption that the video mode should be set to
whatever my computer is using.  In my case, I have my machine set to
800x600 and 16-bit (High) color.  I set the video mode to this, but when
I ran my script, it was looking for 640x480, 8 bit.  When I selected
this mode in "Basic Tests>Set Video Mode", it worked.  Keep in mind -
it's not enough to just "test" the mode, you have to click the "Just
Select It" button as well.  At least, it wouldn't work for me until I
did this.
