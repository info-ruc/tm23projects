   Well, T and <t> don't set the frame duration, F and % do.  T sets the 
time limit on the subjects RT in milliseconds, F and % set the frame 
duration in tics.  You'll probably also want to keep the time limit less 
that the frame's duration for your continuous running FMRI task (otherwise 
DMDX will wait for an RT if it hasn't been received by the display's end 
time leading to inconsistent total run times). Also, in item 101 you'll 
want to specify the frame's duration in the last frame, a comma operator is 
a frame delimiter that forces the duration of the first frame to be zero 
and for the second frame to not erase the first's display so it only makes 
sense to set the duration in the last part of a comma separated series of 
frames.
