   Ok, about a year later than I originally anticipated we have passable 
listserv threading program, a year later because the code that generates 
the archive HTML is about an order of magnitude more complex than I 
imagined it would be (email is not a very rigidly defined format).  Now 
messages are binned by the month that they occur in (I like that post of 
Anna's in Jan 100, never noticed that before).  The program still parses 
the entire list archive for every request as I haven't decided on a neat 
way of doing disk buffering yet which just means response is a little slow, 
psy1's only a very low end pentium.

Dimensions will always be expressed in the least usable term.
Velocity, for example, will be expressed in furlongs per fortnight.
