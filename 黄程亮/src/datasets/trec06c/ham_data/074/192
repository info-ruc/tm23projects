DMDX-
Hello.  I lost data from a "*.ZIL" today.  I assume my mistake was to 
accidently hit "NO" when it asked if I want to save the data after the 
participant was done giving ratings.  I was wondering if there was a way to 
retrieve it.  I am thinking the answer is "No", but I felt it would not 
hurt to ask.
Also, I was wondering if there is a way to set up DMDX to save the data 
automatically without having to say "YES", I want to save the data?  That 
would be great, and I would be able to avoid the problem of lost 
data.  Also, it would ease my worry that a participant could hit the "ESC" 
button and then hit "NO" and lose the data that way.
If this automatic save feature is not currently available, could it be 
something that could be included in an updated version of DMDX?
