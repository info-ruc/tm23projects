I just found a great way to get free airline miles for purchases I make.  

The program is called WebMiles and every time I make a purchase with one of their partners they give me free airline miles.  What's more, they are not restricted so I can travel on any airline at any time I want with no blackout dates or seat restrictions.

They gave me 50 free WebMiles rewards for signing up and another 250 for filling out my member profile!  All you have to do is click on this link to join:
