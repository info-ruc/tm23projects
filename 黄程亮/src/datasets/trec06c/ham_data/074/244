   You need to include the parameter line, perhaps your blank screen is 
caused by not having <nfb>.

   When using <cr> the only way to wait for a request (in your case a 
trigger from the MRI) is to have an item number of zero which is bad if you 
want those items to be destinations for branches.  So either code your item 
file to not use triggers as destinations for branches or alternatively you 
can opt to not include <cr> in the parameter line in which case _every_ 
item will wait for a request unless you include C option (or <c>) in the item.
