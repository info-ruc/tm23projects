   No problems like you mentioned have been noticed here.  This is while 
you are playing a wave file and then displaying an image?  Unless you are 
displaying huge items with large number of frames in them there shouldn't 
be any data travelling over the PCI bus as it should all be buffered before 
the item begins displaying.  It could be your video card or some other 
component in your machine, as always when you get these kinds of things get 
new versions of the drivers and see if the problem goes away.  I have had 
trouble with the Montego in my Athlon system, never could get it to work 
(can't remember what was broken though) even with the latest 
drivers.  OTOH, the Diamond MX300, another Aureal based card works fine in 
my Athlon system at home.  Perhaps it's a power supply problem, when the 
machine's state changes abruptly you get a power supply sag that none of 
the digital hardware cares about but that the analog stuff on the sound 
card is susceptible to.
