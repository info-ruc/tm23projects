   With all the glowing praise people have been offering DMDX lately and me 
cursing my cruddy cheap digital camera over the weekend it occurs to me 
that if anyone wants to physically show their appreciation for my work on 
DMDX and my answering of the list server questions it engenders they could 
buy me a nicer digital camera than the one I've got.  Something that can 
take closeups, which probably means it needs a zoom (I know next to nothing 
about cameras).  Doesn't need to have enormous resolution as the 
destination is only my web page nor does it need to be able to take lots of 
shots before it's memory fills up but I could _really_ use the ability to 
take a picture of something a few inches across.  Oh, and USB would cool 
too, serial is way slow.
