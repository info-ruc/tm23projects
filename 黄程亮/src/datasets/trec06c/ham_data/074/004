Our systems support person installed a PIO-12 card but found that 310 (the
recommended value) was not a valid resource address for this item on our
machine. When an IO box was connected to the card, however, the machine
would not boot. She said she cleared up conflicts so the machine would start
with the IO box connected. She changed the input\ouptut range in the resource
settings in the IO read data port for ISA Plug and play enumerator in the
system devices of the Device manager of the system option of the control
panel. She left it configured with resource address ranges of 0278-027B,
0380-0383, 0338-033B, 0238-023B, which were the closest address ranges to
a typed in 310 that Windows would allow her to choose, and she disabled
the joystick connector to use one of those. She could not find anywhere
in the cmos setup info where she could change the address. The machine is
now starting up and running with the card in it while it is attached to
the IO box, but input from a mouse to the IO box and PIO12 card is not being
recognized by TimeDX or DMDX. Any directions for what we need to do to get
this working?

Thanks,

Keo
