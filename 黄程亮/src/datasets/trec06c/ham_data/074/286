Hi George,

I have tried the button route as you suggested but I fell into new and
distracting confusion!

Since I have no pdfmark mouseover samples or other guidance I think I'd better
stick with what already works...

namely... a pdfmark textfield.

and...

a blank text field that mouseover triggers display of the above text field...

The relevant section of code from a pdf for the acrobat generated 'trigger'
formfield  that does just as I want looks like this:

<<
/Type /Annot
/Subtype /Widget
/Rect [ 156.71654 262.89508 237.31361 289.76077 ]
/T (test01)
/FT /Tx
/DA (/TiRo 18 Tf 1 1 1 rg)
/F 4
/DV (caption)
/V (caption)
/AP << /N 26 0 R >>
/AA << /E 24 0 R /X 25 0 R >>
/P 8 0 R
>>
endobj

24 0 obj
<<
/S /Hide
/H false
/T (instruction)
>>
endobj
25 0 obj
<<
/S /Hide
/T (instruction)
>>
endobj

Can you or anyone else looking in tell me how to re-organise this into a
matching pdfmark?

Greetings

Design documents so it doesn't matter (e.g. make sure nobody ever uses
multiple RETURNS to start a new page).

To this and Aandi's other well-taken points, I would add two examples:

1. Don't use the page's entire available height. When possible, leave at
least 6 millimeters (about 1/4 inch) between your final line and the bottom
margin.

2. Be cautious about compressing text to force that nine-line paragraph to
"just make it" into eight lines. When you switch drivers, the paragraph
might revert to nine lines, forcing a heading onto a different page from
that promised in the table of contents.

I have distilled several files from Frame where I cannot edit text later in
Acrobat. What am I missing? If I change the Times font to Times New Roman,
I can
then edit in Acrobat. Why can't I edit the Times or Helvetica Bold font?

Details:

Error Message: "Warning: You cannot edit text in this font."
Font Info window shows both Times & Helvetica, Bold as Embedded Subset. In
Text
Attributes window, both fonts show the Embed box grayed-out.
Helvetica is also used in this doc. In Font Info Window, Helvetica is
substituted to Arial MT. In Text Attributes window, Helvetica shows as
Helvetica, not Arial MT.


Randall,

This sounds strange. Times and Helvetica Bold are "safe" fonts that, if all
is well, should always be available to the Acrobatter, even if not
explicitly embedded in the document. Evidently, your system is mapping
these two fonts to TrueType equivalents that, by default, are subsetted.
Characters rendered in a subsetted font cannot be edited. I have seen
PostScript fonts rendered as TrueType by PDFWriter, but never by Distiller.

Your first step is to verify that these fonts are where Distiller can find
them. Open Adobe Type Manager, select the Fonts tab, and make sure Times
and Helvetica Bold fonts are showing up in the left pane. If they're not,
click your way into a PostScript font folder, selecting them, and clicking
Add.

The locations of these folders depends on your operating system and the
versions of your Acrobat components. On my Windows 98 PC, they're in C:
\PSFONTS\pfm\, in C:\Acrobat3\Distiller\Fonts\pfm\, and in C:
\Acrobat3\Exchange\Fonts\pfm\,

If Times and Helvetica Bold are, indeed, already visible in ATM's left
pane, visit  Distiller > Job Options > Font Embedding, and make sure Subset
fonts... is deselected.

Given the complexity of font issues, both of my suggestions may fail to
solve your problem. Acrobatters, please contribute some additional checks.

By the way, Bill Hinely, a fellow Acrobatter at NEC, recently was sent a
PDF that had a typo requiring correction. The misspelled word was in a
subsetted font--in this case, Times New Roman--and hence non-editable. Bill
selected the word with the Touchup tool, changed the font to Times, and
corrected the typo. (It was Bill's first month as an Acrobatter, and no one
had informed him that solving font problems isn't supposed to be that
easy.)

Can anyone suggest a way to convert an ASCII file (straight text) to PDF?
We use FrameMaker 5.5.6 and also have MS Word loaded on our PCs.
I'm guessing the best way is to bring the file into FrameMaker
and then convert it to PDF, although it would be a lot easier and preferable
if there was a method to go directly from ASCII to PDF.  

Thanks in advance for any help or advice.

Kevin,
Unless you have already attempted this, select your Acrobat PDF Writer as
the printer, print the file directly to the writer and save it that way. (On
some systems it may be necessary to set up the Acrobat PDF Writer as your
default system printer.)
Best of luck!
Marty

With name it plugin i create 4 named destinations :

The final idea is to have a html page with 2 frames :

in the left one, we'll have the html page with the link-named destinations

in the right one, we'll have the acrobat reader to see the acrobat file

so, when you'll click on a named destination, it appears in the right frame
with acrobat reader.

BUT after, if you want to go to another named destination from the left
frame, nothing appears in the rignt frame.

If i point the named destination on a new ie window it's work !

SO, HOW TO DO FEW NAMED DESTINATIONS SUCCESSIVELLY IN THE SAME FRAME FROM
ANOTHER FRAME ?

Regards

Excuse me for my english, i'm french !

There are several utilities around for converting directly from plain ascii
to PDF.
Gymnast is one, ISTR that Sanface Software has others.

Hello to my fellow PDFers. I sure enjoyed meeting some of you in San Diego
at the .PDF 2000 conference!

I need your help. I have to massage PDFs that are created by parties other
than myself. The problem is that many of these alien PDFs have been
optimized for the press but I need to use them for a desktop printing
environment. I have created a guidelines document for the marketing
manager of our company. He intends to include this document along with our
legal agreements with these third party companies (where the alien PDFs
come from).

I want to make sure that my guidelines are correct. You can help by
checking out the web page I just threw together of my document and giving
me some feedback. Ignore the bracketed comments that are intended for my
co-workers, Rich and Peter. While looking over my guidelines, take into
account that I have discovered that most of the alien PDFs are created on
Macs using Quark. I work on Windows 98, therefore comments specific to Mac
to Windows issues including fonts will be appreciated.

Do you agree with my Distiller settings?

Thanks a bunch! PDFers unite!

Okay - let me offer a different perspective.

(samll comment - PDF files never "re-flow" - the font might "change" - 
like, if the font is not embeded, the characters might switch from 
'Bodoni' to "Courier" or Multiple Masters kicks in and does its best, but 
PDFs don't "reflow" like PostScript files can when processed (or Quark or 
Word can do)

As a prepress system developer, we found that people generally fall into 
four catagories on this issue of fonts and embedding/subsetting.

[1] NEVER EMBED - some font manufacturers wish that this was more or less 
impossible, hoping that people would need to buy the fonts at both ends - 
in one case, we have a proposal where the PDF making gadget that might 
embed or subset the font requires a dongle to run and embeds a "key" 
insides the PDF that requires that the reciever ALSO has the dongle at 
the RIP, so, even though the RIP does NOT require the font to process the 
file, the font manufacturer is assured that they RIP owner has purchase 
the font (or the right to "use" the font -

and before you say "gee, thats dumb!" consider that some languages have 
over 10,000 characters/glyphs in the font!
 
(- just be happy that we don't have more than 256 characters for a font 
in the US!)

SO, in these cases, you would NEVER consider embeding the entire font - 
you would almost always subset, and sometimes (as in the case i describe 
above) both parties might do themselves a BIG favor and use the same 
font, and never embed any font infomation.

[2] EMBED THE ENTIRE FONT, NEVER SUBSET - some design people would like 
to embed the entire font, so if there are any last minute changes, these 
can be accomplished without any heroics - some font manufacturers seem to 
think this unfair, as this enables people whom might recieve such a PDF 
with editable embeded fonts to be able to use the font without owning the 
font (which from my perspective, is silly, since the Acrobat Touch up too 
only lets you work on a line at a time, and if you tried to open the PDF 
into Illustrator and did not have the font installed, all sorts of chaos 
ensues...

So, in this case, as a buyer of design, I always INSIST that the people 
designing brochures ALWAYS use Type1 fonts (which are always embedable), 
NEVER use TrueType (which can contain "flags" that diable embeding, 
downloading or outlineing), and ALWAYS embed ALL fonts, and NEVER Subset 
- and i assume that the people whom they exchange these PDF files will 
take care to make sure they Process/Print/ these PDFs as they are 
intended to be Processed/Printed - using the FONTS THAT ARE EMBEDED.

[3] ALWAYS EMBED, ALWAYS SUBSET - okay, so [2] is utopia, but sometimes 
we NEVER want ANY editing, even non-intended/inadvertant changes (font 
subsitution when RIPing if the font is NOT embeded, or even if it IS 
EMBEDED someone can indeed "PROCESSES/PRINTS it incorectly) - so i guess 
thats why the Associated Press, with its AP ADSEND service, (where they 
offer a service for advertisers to exchange Ads with newspapers here in 
the US) insists that you subset - this is especially true when you have 
old systems, they are paginating the ads (placing one PDF into another 
document, sometimes Quark, sometime another PDF) - this is indeed the 
second most safest method...

[4] OUTLINEwhen i don't want anyone even thinking about editing the text 
in a document, even when they INTEND to try, and don't even want them to 
do ANYTHING but be able to print it (and not even let them select text 
and paste into some other document like an email, you can do several 
things - one, you can outline the text (some authoring/design 
applications let you do this (like Illustrator) some Printer drivers on 
some platforms (and from within the print dialog boxes) enable you to do 
this (Corel on Windows, for example) - as well, you can turn on Security 
(either in Distiller or when you "save as" a new PDF from Exchange) where 
you only allow opening the document and printing - no changing the 
document, no selecting text and graphics, no adding and changing note and 
form fields...this way, when you go to under the Acrobat File menu and 
select Document Info" > Fonts > 

- it says NONE.

<smile>

no substitution or relow possibilities there!

Our PDF making product, Agfa Apogee Create, does not allow subsetting, 
but will ONLY successfully create a PDF if all the fonts are present and 
accounted for, as we will "fail" a PostScript file that requires fonts 
that are not able to be embeded - we felt that the best was to go was to 
embed the entire font that the document requires, as it affords the best 
of options of reliable exchange and last minute edting.

you can try a fully featured, nothing disabled version of Agfa Apogee 
Create free for thirty days by downloading it from;

http://www.agfa.com/create/

I guess everybodys right. but sometimes they disagree.

hope this helps.

Situation: 12 duo-tones (Black & PMS 2587 CV) created in Photoshop 5.0.2
using a consistent method.
                After running through Distiller 4.0 using press
specifications I had varying results. 7 of the
                images distilled properly, the other 5 distilled as Cyan
only.

Solution:  ???   Please help as this project is past due.

using a consistent method.
                After running through Distiller 4.0 using press

Photoshop Duotone Looks Different or Separates Incorrectly After 
Converting to PDF

Issue
After you create a PDF file from a document that contains an Adobe 
Photoshop Duotone image, the Duotone image in the PDF file looks 
distorted or inverted, is missing spot colors, or separates 
incorrectly.

Solutions
Do one or more of the following:

Solution 1
If you're using Adobe Acrobat Distiller 4.0, re save the Duotone file 
in Photoshop 5.0.2 or later with transfer functions included, and 
then re-create the PDF file:
1. Open the EPS file in Photoshop 5.0.2 or later.
2. Choose File > Save As.
3. In the EPS Options dialog box, select the Include Transfer 
Function option, and then click OK.
4. Re-create the PDF file.

Solution 2
If you're using Acrobat Distiller 3.0x, re save the Duotone file in 
Photoshop 4.0 or later with transfer functions included, and then 
re-create the PDF file with the transfer functions applied:
1. Open the EPS file in Photoshop 4.0 or later.
2. Choose File > Save As.
3. In the EPS Options dialog box, select the Include Transfer 
Function option, and then click OK.
4. Change Acrobat Distiller's Job Options to apply transfer 
functions: Choose Distiller > Job Options, click the Advanced tab, 
choose Apply from the Transfer Functions pop-up menu, and then click 
OK.
5. Re-create the PDF file.

Solution 3
If you're using Acrobat Distiller 3.0x, choose Distiller > Job 
Options, click the Advanced tab, de select Convert CMYK Image To RGB, 
and then re-create the PDF file.

Solution 4
If you are creating the PDF file from an Adobe PageMaker publication, 
place no more than one Duotone image on a page in PageMaker and then 
re-create the PDF file.

Solution 5
If the Duotone image contains spot colors and they are missing from 
the PDF file, do one of the following:
- Re-create the PDF file using Acrobat Distiller 4.0 and select the 
Screen optimized or Press optimized job option.
- Print the Duotone image as a separated Postscript file from 
Photoshop; or, place the Duotone image into a page layout application 
(e.g., PageMaker) and print it as a separated Postscript file. Then, 
distill the Postscript file containing the color separations. The 
resulting PDF file contains one page for each separation plate.

Additional Information
A Duotone has a two-component color space, which is represented in 
Postscript Language level 3 and in PDF 1.3 as a device-n color space. 
Photoshop 4.0.x and 5.0 do not use the device-n color space for duo 
tones. Instead, they save duotones in the CMYK color space with a set 
of four transfer functions, one each for C, M, Y, and K. Photoshop 
5.0.2 and 5.5, by comparison, use the device-n color space for 
duotones and therefore don't include transfer functions with duotones.

Acrobat Distiller 3.0x does not directly support duotone separations: 
If it converts a duotone image from Photoshop 4.0.x or 5.0, it must 
convert a duotone file into CMYK images using the file's transfer 
functions. When Apply is chosen from the Transfer Functions pop-up 
menu in Acrobat Distiller 3.0x's Job Options dialog box, Acrobat 
Distiller 3.0x converts the duotone data to CMYK data for both 
on-screen display and printing, and duotone files in the resulting 
PDF file appear and print with the correct colors. When Remove is 
chosen from the Transfer Functions pop-up menu, Acrobat Distiller 
3.0x ignores transfer functions in duotone files, causing the files 
to appear and print with inverted colors. When Preserve is chosen 
from the Transfer Functions pop-up menu, Acrobat Distiller 3.0x 
preserves transfer functions, but it utilizes them only when 
printing, causing the duotone files to appear with inverted colors. 
(Please note that using the Preserve option for PDF files you intend 
to print is not recommended, since some PostScript printers may 
ignore transfer functions embedded in images in larger PostScript 
files.)

By default, the Convert CMYK Images to RGB option is enabled in 
Acrobat Distiller 3.0x. This option helps reduce PDF file size and 
improves the speed with which a PDF file opens, because less 
information is needed to describe an RGB image than a CMYK image. 
Acrobat Distiller 3.0x may incorrectly convert the colors for a 
duotone image created in Photoshop.

Acrobat Distiller 4.0 supports duotones that include transfer 
functions and it automatically applies transfer functions. Acrobat 
Distiller 4.0 supports duotones only from Photoshop 5.0 or later, 
however.

__________________________________________________________________

We have created a handbook that is available to our
coordinators via a Windows 2000 server and thin
clients.

On forms that we would like them to submit  time off,
work schedule changes, time cards, etc. we created
separate 1-page pdf so the could mailto the management
team there fdf's and the management team could view the
data in the acrobat document on their client.

What we have found it is that we no idea how to make
this work.

first, the client users get the following error message
"You need to be running inside a web browser in order
to submit this form".  sounds easy, but how do I make
sure that the acrobat document opens in a web browser? 
Is there a setting for this?  (we have the netscape
communicator / messenger system installed
company-wide.)

Second,  My computer opens up the sent forms no
problem, my boss's computer opens them up no problem,
but my boss's boss's computer gives an error message to
the effect of where is the pdf that should be used to
view the fdf data.  (If you need exact error message, I
can recreate the scenario).

I am not nor will I ever be authorized to spend money
on this.

Any help is appreciated

This will happen if
(a) a compatible browser is in use
(b) Acrobat is installed AFTER the browser (Netscape only)
(c) "Web browser integration" is on in the user's preferences
(d) the file comes from the web or is opened in a browser

Don't try to use mailto submission. For all sorts of reasons,
but unpredictable behaviour and lost messages are two good
ones. Another is that Adobe try hard to not make e-mail
work with the free Reader, preferring you to use the full
product. Instead, use a web-hosted script (ASP or CGI).

Because Acrobat 4.0 no longer supports Helvetica and Times (can you say
"copyright
violation"?), so when you distilled to PDF, Arial MT got substituted for
Helvetica,
and Times New Roman PS MT got substituted for Times.  You have to use the
lookalike
fonts of Arial MT or Times New Roman PS MT (or something else entirely) if you
want
to be able to edit them in PDF. Just one of the rude surprises of Acrobat 4.0.

Dov Isaacs wrote:
Acrobat 4.0x fully supports Helvetica and Times. However, it does not bundle
these fonts. If you generate PostScript that has Times and/or Helvetica
embedded,
those fonts will embed and be used for display.
However, if you have a PostScript file that requests Times or Helvetica and you
don't have Times or Helvetica installed, these substitute fonts will be used.
If you have license to Times and Helvetica and you know what you are doing, one
little trick that works very well is to copy the 8 .pfm and 8 .pfb files for
Times and Helvetica into the Acrobat Resource\Font\PFM and Resource\Font
directories
and delete the corresponding Arial and Times New Roman .pfm and .pfb files.
In that case, on your system, PDF files that request Helvetica and Times but
don't
have them embedded get "the real thing" when displayed.

Paul Franklin Stregevsky wrote:
Your first step is to verify that these fonts are where Distiller can find
them. Open Adobe Type Manager, select the Fonts tab, and make sure Times
and Helvetica Bold fonts are showing up in the left pane. If they're not,
click your way into a PostScript font folder, selecting them, and clicking
Add.
If Times and Helvetica Bold are, indeed, already visible in ATM's left
pane, visit  Distiller > Job Options > Font Embedding, and make sure Subset
fonts... is deselected.

In summary, I checked both situations that Paul mentioned. Both were as he
mentioned, so no fix was made. Dov suggested a fix which I was unable to
complete successfully. Gail's fix is what I ended up using. As the doc is in
it's infancy, as far as a style guide goes, I was able to change fonts and make
it work correctly.

I have a recurring problem with color in full Screen mode.

The CDROM distribution pdf (origination in Quark) that I am developing
looks fine in menu view in Acrobat 4.05 but in FullScreen there is a
marked and unacceptable colour shift towards red/blue.

I could adjust the spot colour to be 'tranlsated' adequately but the
dozens of colour images are all unacceptably degraded.
I am using eBook setup in Distiller and the problem is duplicated on a
second (PC 350Meg) machine.

Is this an Acrobat fault/limitation? Does anyone have any idea how I
might progress a solution?

Thanks

If it's a shift that seems similar to an RGB->CMYK conversion, then make
sure you write .ps from XPress using Composite RGB (assuming you're using
XPress 4.1 or later) in your Print Dialog (on the Output Tab for Plates.
This will help retain vividness of your colors...

It might not be possible. What are you trying to 
accomplish, exactly?

I have been creating bookmarks with inter-document bookmark actions
(i.e. GoToR in PDF) using a plug-in that I am working on. I am setting
the destination to inherit zoom by using, for example, "/XYZ -4 842
null" and have found that in Acrobat 4.05 (at least) the zoom is NOT
retained. However, if I create similar bookmarks that go elsewhere
within the same file, the inherit zoom does work. Is this an Acrobat
bug?

To check that it was not my plug-in, I tried creating an inter-document
bookmark from the Acrobat interface and found that the inherit zoom does
not work there. (It did seem to initially but if you save, close and re-
open the file it does not.)

Can anyone confirm this or suggest a work-around?

Regards

David

I am looking for a utility for Acrobat Distiller that will process multiple
postrcript files to one PDF file without any font conflicts. I know of the
instructions from Acrobat to use the postscript utility. I was hoping there
is something easier.

	For what platform?  Mac OS or Windows?

	What do you mean by "font conflicts"?   Are you trying to 
avoid having multiple copies of the same font in the file?

I've experienced problems when a font would bold after incorporating more
than one pdf file together. Acrobat recommends using the postscript file
that is bundled with Acrobat Distiller. This is a time consuming task. I was
hoping that there was a more user friendly utility.

	That doesn't make any sense why that would happen UNLESS your 
PS files weren't correctly generated.  Make sure you embed the fonts.

	There may well be, but since I STILL don't know what OS 
platform you are using, I can't recommend anything yet :(

you might try running it thru Agfa Apogee Create

http://www.agfa.org/create/

it  is free for 30 days, and is fully functional - i would need to "see" 
the page to tell you whats wrong otherwise - can you post it somewhere?

(DONT EMAIL IT or attach it!)

Hi List-

Have belonged here (digest) for over a year, but just starting to regularly
produce PDFs. 

1.  To avoid my asking a string of basic questions, can folks recommend one
or two of the best books? (I see mine are all version 3.) (How soon is
version 5 due out?)

2.  Here is one of those questions. I made a PDF of a 2-page 3-fold
brochure, landscape, from Quark 4.xx using the Export as PDF function, with
Laserwriter 8 from the chooser. The PDF looked fine, but the only way I can
print all of it (smaller) is to choose Fit to Page among the Reader options.
(Also tried to print it from Acrobat.)

Otherwise, it prints an incomplete landscape page. Printing starts 5 picas
from the left edge and ends 8 picas from the right. So printing is almost 9
inches wide, which "sounds like" 8.5 plus bleeds. Went back and made
another, looking for every chance I could find to choose Letter and
Lansdscape. (Including creating a new Acrobat Distiller job settings profile
with Landscape dimensions as the default page size.) Again, looks great on
the screen but prints incomplete. Tried choosing Tabloid paper, but the
multipurpose tray is not available and Letter paper is used.

TIA...

Denis,

See the following for a sample PDF: 
http://www.peakforms.com/pdfs/denis2.pdf (8 kB)

It includes two file annotations that are the EPS files 
that contain the pdfmark code for each field. If you 
have any questions, post again.

Good luck!

George

Hi Todd,

I wish it were that simple.

The problem is most apparent when I put up both the quark file and the pdf file
in menu view next to each other. The color is very obviously identical.  By
comparison, the Fullscreen View is unacceptably off-balance towards blue. So it
doesn't seem likely to be a Quark issue.

But a big problem nonetheless since I am working with close to 1000 screens and
hundreds of images.

BTW I have tried changing the Fullscreen frame from black to grey to see if
there was some artefact there but it didn't make any difference.

Any other suggestions/lines of enquiry would be welcome.

Greetings

I have a little web site that shows .pdf docs in frames.  As I navigate
throughout the site, I notice that the memory usage of acrobat.exe has shot
up to 16mb.  And after I leave the site, acrobat.exe is still there.

Is there a way to tell the Acrobat ActiveX control to "show this pdf and
quit when done"?  Or is there just a way via HTML for the client to
close/quit/kill acrobat.exe?

Thanks.

Why are you worried about 16 mb of swap space?

We are using FDFMerge for dynamically generating PDF files, we are getting various results with IE and Acrobat Reader. In one instance we get a blank screen and in the other it is working. Does anybody know if this could be a problem with different versions of Acrobat Reader and IE working together ?

	Since the color is correct in normal viewing mode, then we 
know that Acrobat has all the correct information for displaying the 
file - so there is no issue about how it put together.  That leaves 
Acrobat and full screen mode.

	It sounds like you are using Windows as your OS platform, and 
Windows is well know for having "less than accurate" color correction 
code.  I wonder if when Acrobat goes "full screen", it ends up having 
to rely on Windows code, rather than it's own, and hence the problem.

	One way to check this out would be to try viewing the file on 
a Mac - both regular and full screen and see if the problem persists. 
Also, you might want to try using an alternative PDF viewer (perhaps 
Ghostscript?) and see if it has similar problems.

__________________________________________________________________

I'm wanting to scan documents into PDF, but allowing defined margins at top,
bottom, left and right.
Acrobat4 seems only to allow me to capture the scanned area (the bounding
rectangle), it allows me to scale it, but I can't figure out how to add a
margin around the scanned image ( I can crop the page, but not add to it).
Or to put it another way, what I want to do is scan the page into the space
that's left once I've allowed my defined margins (lets say 1 inch)  to my
page size (lets say A4). Can I do this with Acrobat, do I need Capture, are
there any tricks?

many thanks

Tim

Hi George,

This is very generous of you. The sample fields are just what I need.... however
as of this moment I haven't been able to extract the two attached pdfmarkfiles.
On this (PC) machine .eps is associated with Photoshop and I don't have a copy
of Illustrator which I guess would be the preferred application.

Could you post or e-mail the pdfmark code? (or otherwise point me to how to open
the attachments)

Greetings

This does sound a promising way to check it out... though discouraging if
true.... since the PC platform is the place the final object will mostly go.

I don't think we've yet seen how you are specifying the colour.
Are you using RGB or CMYK? 
If you are using RGB, are you making sure that XPress is not
turning them to CMYK?

My Distiller doesn't have an ebook setting. Where did your come

 I just opened up a random PDF on the Mac OS, and switched to full-screen
mode, and saw no difference in color.

simply put........flash 4
i want to move 3or 4 boxes across a scene window (preferably in a MC)
i need to have the user be able to roll over the boxes and have the 
MC stop until they move away at which time the MC 
continues..............sound simple so far ? i also need the ability 
to have the user click on (on press) each box and be transported to 
another scene in the project.

the question is how .........should the process be in the main time 
line and not in an MC ?


be well

You should perform this type of operation on the TIFF file before converting to PDF.  Have your scanner make TIF files rather than going "straight" to PDF. As a TIF, you can easily pad the whitespace around your page-image with a tool such as ScanFix, from TMSSequoia.  THEN you are ready to bring it into PDF.

Denis,

After you extract the EPS files, you can simply open 
them in a text editor to see the pdfmark code. They're 
simple text files.

To extract the files to your machine, first save the PDF 
to your machine, open it directly in Acrobat (not in a 
browser) right-click an annotation and select "Extract 
File...". Do not double-click or otherwise launch the 
files. Note that you will need Acrobat 4 or Business 
Tools.

If you have any problems, I'd be happy to post the text 
here.

George

__________________________________________________________________

We're suddenly unable to print decent graphics (screen shots) in PDFs
to a PCL printer (such as a LaserJet).  Printing to a PostScript
printer is ok.

The PDFs are created by printing from the layout application to
Distiller Assistant/Distiller 3.01.  Distiller 3.01's compression is
set to:

Compress Text and Line Art -- checked

Color Bitmap Images
   Downsample to: 600 dpi
   Automatic Compression: ZIP/JPEG High

Grayscale Bitmap Images
   Downsample to: 600 dpi
   Automatic Compression: ZIP/JPEG High

Monochrome Bitmap Images
   Downsample to: 600 dpi
   Manual Compression: CCITT Group 4

Our PDF used to print ok to PCL printers, so something has changed,
but I can't figure out what I'm overlooking.  I'll be most grateful
for any help offered.

FWIW, we long ago decided not to use Acro4 because Ambia's Compose
doesn't recognize Acro4's PS coding for embedded Times and Helvetica
fonts.

TIA,

Acrobat remaining loaded is a feature. Acrobat will 
close down after several minutes of non-use. I've never 
experienced a problem with it.

__________________________________________________________________

I am currently working on a project that involves disseminating data from a v5.03 Lotus Notes database in PDF format.  My solution would be to find the capability that would allow a user to automatically convert a Notes document to a PDF document in one step (preferably from a menu pick or a button).  I
can partially do this now, in a manual fashion, by
selecting the print option, using the pdfwriter and then specify the filename and save location.  This is one to many steps for an end user to remember.  I was told by a third party vendor that by installing the full version of Adobe Acrobat with the Lotus Client (version?) would produce a menu pick
(File\"Convert to PDF") from within Notes.  I guess there is an API loaded here?  I have been unable to determine or confirm whether this is true or not? Is there someone out there with a suggestion or  may have done this already and can provide me with step by step instructions/information about how to
perform this function?

Thanks for any help,

Shep

I have over 30,000 PDF files that are encrypted. I have a security password
to change the file and I have changing the document not allowed set. What I
would like to do is batch process all of these files to clear the security
settings and turn off the encryption.

Right now using Acrobat 4.05 I can clear the security settings but my files
are still encrypted. So the security method still shows as standard. I need
this cleared. Does anyone know of a tool to do this?

__________________________________________________________________

I'm creating a pdf file for a client to be
put on a CD as a marketing piece.
I want the CD to autorun when inserted
into a PC computer. I've tried the two differnet autorun.info
files below. However, with either one, when the
CD is inserted, a window comes up saying the .exe file
cannot not be located with an option to locate.
When you click on the locate button and then
click on the CD it locates the .exe file. Once that
is done, the CD will autorun anytime you put
it into that same computer. But as soon as you
take it to another CD it asks to locate the .exe file-
if you burn a new CD it will still work on
that computer without having to locate the .exe file.
My client wants their potential customers to be
able to insert the CD into their computer and
Acrobat Reader and the pdf file automatically comes up.
Does anyone have any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong
and what I need to do to fix it.


[autorun]
open="Acrobat 4.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" filename.pdf
defaulticon=Acrobat 0



With this autorun.info below, I capitalized the .exe and the filename
because that is the way it burned onto the CD.
I work on a macintosh, and the file names are all
lower case, but when I burn the CD for ISO it capitalizes
the file names. This CD does not have to be
cross platform - I just want it to autorun for pc.

[autorun]
open=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE FILENAME.PDF
icon=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE

I would greatly appreciate any info on making a CD autorun
on the PC platform.

Thanks,
Gayle

We use the RunFilEx and RunDirEx postscript programs provided by Adobe, and
have had no problem. Those have not worked for you? In another post, you
said it was "time consuming" to use that method. How much time are you
talking about, and which part takes up the time? Also, Leonard Rosenthall
asked you how you were producing your postscript files...did I miss your
response to that?

We're on WinNT4, with Acro4.05.

Subject: [PDF] autorun

__________________________________________________________________

I'm creating a pdf file for a client to be
put on a CD as a marketing piece.
I want the CD to autorun when inserted
into a PC computer. I've tried the two differnet autorun.info
files below. However, with either one, when the
CD is inserted, a window comes up saying the .exe file
cannot not be located with an option to locate.
When you click on the locate button and then
click on the CD it locates the .exe file. Once that
is done, the CD will autorun anytime you put
it into that same computer. But as soon as you
take it to another CD it asks to locate the .exe file-
if you burn a new CD it will still work on
that computer without having to locate the .exe file.
My client wants their potential customers to be
able to insert the CD into their computer and
Acrobat Reader and the pdf file automatically comes up.
Does anyone have any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong
and what I need to do to fix it.


[autorun]
open="Acrobat 4.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" filename.pdf
defaulticon=Acrobat 0



With this autorun.info below, I capitalized the .exe and the filename
because that is the way it burned onto the CD.
I work on a macintosh, and the file names are all
lower case, but when I burn the CD for ISO it capitalizes
the file names. This CD does not have to be
cross platform - I just want it to autorun for pc.

[autorun]
open=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE FILENAME.PDF
icon=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE

I would greatly appreciate any info on making a CD autorun
on the PC platform.

Thanks,
Gayle

Sorry to put you to that trouble.... I have never even seen a mention of
embedded files in Acrobat... I guess i never got that far in the manual.

The pdfmarks work fine... now all I have to do is write the captions to go in
them <sigh>

Thanks a lot.

I believe I'm only using RGB... the color quality is consistent between
applications ie photoshop, quark and the acrobat menu view. It is only the Full
View that is adrift

There is an associated 91pp pdf  'How to Create Adobe pdf Files for eBooks'.
Very handy it has been lately.

I'll try some of the suggestions people have made in other messages and get back
with what I discover.

Thanks for your help

It is possible nobody has thought they could sell this
because Distiller gives away the RunFileX facility for
free. Try it - you might find it works for you.

You really need to confirm this. It is hard work to get RGB
out of Distiller - can you check how you are specifying the
colours, and make sure you have the option to print in RGB.

If not, you are generating CMYK. CMYK display has no standard,
and can vary radically (though it is unusual to vary in
one application).

To create and auto run command, do you just copy this into a *.txt file and
place it on the CD or is there a specific way to create the auto run
command?  I have been looking for a way to do this for a while now.  Thanks!

Create the file in notepad and save as:  autorun.inf
Then copy autorun.inf to the root directory on the CD ROM

This will work AS LONG as the computer operator has not changed the settings
for their CD Rom drive.
To check look under My Computer, Device Manager, CD ROM Settings, Auto
insert notification must be checked.

To create and auto run command, do you just copy this into a *.txt file and
place it on the CD or is there a specific way to create the auto run
command?  I have been looking for a way to do this for a while now.  Thanks!

__________________________________________________________________

I'm creating a pdf file for a client to be
put on a CD as a marketing piece.
I want the CD to autorun when inserted
into a PC computer. I've tried the two differnet autorun.info
files below. However, with either one, when the
CD is inserted, a window comes up saying the .exe file
cannot not be located with an option to locate.
When you click on the locate button and then
click on the CD it locates the .exe file. Once that
is done, the CD will autorun anytime you put
it into that same computer. But as soon as you
take it to another CD it asks to locate the .exe file-
if you burn a new CD it will still work on
that computer without having to locate the .exe file.
My client wants their potential customers to be
able to insert the CD into their computer and
Acrobat Reader and the pdf file automatically comes up.
Does anyone have any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong
and what I need to do to fix it.


[autorun]
open="Acrobat 4.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" filename.pdf
defaulticon=Acrobat 0



With this autorun.info below, I capitalized the .exe and the filename
because that is the way it burned onto the CD.
I work on a macintosh, and the file names are all
lower case, but when I burn the CD for ISO it capitalizes
the file names. This CD does not have to be
cross platform - I just want it to autorun for pc.

[autorun]
open=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE FILENAME.PDF
icon=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE

I would greatly appreciate any info on making a CD autorun
on the PC platform.

Thanks,
Gayle

This is an excerpt from the Acrobat Guide (4.05). A bit clumsy but it may
get you started. I would think there might be an API or some product in
PDFZONE.
Hope it helps.

To combine PostScript files into one PDF file:
1. Start a text editor or a word processor.
2. Choose File > Open, use the browser to locate Runfilex.ps (Windows) or
RunFilEx.ps (Mac OS) in the Acrobat Distiller Xtras folder, and open the
file as a
text file with carriage returns.
3. Follow the instructions in the Runfilex.ps or RunFileEx.ps file. Note
that this
utility combines PostScript files in the order in which they are listed.
4. Choose File > Save As, and save the modified Runfilex.ps or RunFileEx.ps
under a new name. Use the name you want Distiller to give the PDF file. For
example, if you name the file Handbook.ps, Distiller creates a PDF file
called
Handbook.pdf. If you're using a word processor, save the file as a text
file.
5. Quit the text editor or word processor.
6. Open the file in Distiller.
7. Convert the combined file to PDF, or place the file in an In folder to be
converted later.
8. When the PDF file is ready, open the file in Acrobat and make sure that
all of
the document parts are present and in the correct order.
To combine PostScript files that are in the same folder:
Follow the instructions in the Rundirex.txt (Windows) or RunDirEx.txt (Mac
OS)
file in the Acrobat Distiller Xtras folder.

how about 

[autorun]
OPEN=shelexec start.pdf

while shellexec is a free little program that just opens a window and is started from CD. The start.pdf will then search the PDF viewer all by itself. This is suitable for all Windows versions (as far as I know).

__________________________________________________________________

I'm creating a pdf file for a client to be
put on a CD as a marketing piece.
I want the CD to autorun when inserted
into a PC computer. I've tried the two differnet autorun.info
files below. However, with either one, when the
CD is inserted, a window comes up saying the .exe file
cannot not be located with an option to locate.
When you click on the locate button and then
click on the CD it locates the .exe file. Once that
is done, the CD will autorun anytime you put
it into that same computer. But as soon as you
take it to another CD it asks to locate the .exe file-
if you burn a new CD it will still work on
that computer without having to locate the .exe file.
My client wants their potential customers to be
able to insert the CD into their computer and
Acrobat Reader and the pdf file automatically comes up.
Does anyone have any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong
and what I need to do to fix it.


[autorun]
open="Acrobat 4.0\Reader\AcroRd32.exe" filename.pdf
defaulticon=Acrobat 0



With this autorun.info below, I capitalized the .exe and the filename
because that is the way it burned onto the CD.
I work on a macintosh, and the file names are all
lower case, but when I burn the CD for ISO it capitalizes
the file names. This CD does not have to be
cross platform - I just want it to autorun for pc.

[autorun]
open=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE FILENAME.PDF
icon=reader_search\Reader\ACRORD32.EXE

I would greatly appreciate any info on making a CD autorun
on the PC platform.

Thanks,
Gayle

Dear Jeremy,

30,000 files did you say! One suggestion I have which may work as long as
you don't have TrueType fonts used in your PDF, is to export your PDF as an
EPS, then redistill, if it does work - you've got 29,999 left to go! - you
might perhaps be better off with a tool/utility that does this - no doubt
there will be one about...

I have over 30,000 PDF files that are encrypted. I have a security password
to change the file and I have changing the document not allowed set. What I
would like to do is batch process all of these files to clear the security
settings and turn off the encryption.

Right now using Acrobat 4.05 I can clear the security settings but my files
are still encrypted. So the security method still shows as standard. I need
this cleared. Does anyone know of a tool to do this?

Yes, our Options plug-in for Acrobat can do this. See our web site for
an evaluation version to try out.

__________________________________________________________________

We have a customer-furnished PDF file to be output to film for prepress. The
original PDF file looks perfect on screen, as do the laser proofs supplied
to us. The majority of the two-column text is perfect. One file has lists of
the casts of characters in a movie and these are the problem. There is a
character's name at the left, followed by leader dots, followed by the
actor's name; several different lists consisting of multiple lines like
this. All appear properly justified left and right on screen and lasers.
However, when output to film (and lasers) the leaders and the actors names
are pushed out to the right, into the other column or off the page.

We've tried exporting to postscript and redistilling, with the same end
result only in addition we can now see the text looking bad on screen too.
We are proceeding to fix in PitStop, editing lines manually. However, we'd
like to educate the customer to avoid in the future. Any ideas? Here are
specs for the file, from Acrobat:
Created in QuarkXPress, using PSPrinter 8.1.1 and Distiller 3.01 for
Macintosh, PDF 1.2. The fonts are Type 1, Courtney-Regular and
Courtney-Bold. Fonts are embedded and subset.

When file is exported to postscript from Acrobat 4, and then analyzed in
Download Mechanic, it is reported to be PostScript Level 2, DSC 3.0
compliant, Creator QuarkXPress\252: PSPrinter 8.1.1. Fonts are embedded.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

I would suggest you not subset the fonts first of all. Second, the only
reliable way I have exported postscript or EPS files from Acrobat 4.x is to
use ASCII level 1. I don't understand why Level 2 or binary doesn't work.
But ASCII level 1 always works for me. What happens when you use PitStop to
embed the fonts and the export PS/EPS?

The problems you encounter are most likely a problem with Quark XPress
which has its own idea about exactly what it considers kosher for EPS.
(Note that according to the Red Book specification, EPS can be somewhat
arbitrary PostScript with relatively few restrictions!) For other applications,
we have found no general problems with use of binary encoding and/or PostScript
Level 2 / PostScript 3 in EPS files exported from Acrobat 4.05a and imported
(placed) into documents that can deal with valid EPS files.

The "Acrobat 4.05 Update 2" on the Adobe web site will update you from 4.05a
to 4.05c and is for Windows only. It only affects Acrobat itself, not the Distiller
or any other component.

 Tim 
Pitstop from Enfocus (enfocus.com)is a Acrobat plug-in that 
will allow you to add space around a PDF. If you have a lot of files
that need this it can even be automated.

The best and shortest answer is "nothing much".

A useful real world answer is: if you have a particular output
device in mind, set it to the resolution of that device
(NOT of the images you use) or higher.

Technically: it does nothing at all in Distiller except set
a number. This number will be given to any PostScript file
that asks "what is the resolution?"  Some PostScript files
will make decisions on the basis of the answer. A typical
example is that some high-end applications like Freehand 
might work out how many steps to use for a graduated blend.
Higher resolutions generate more steps: a better quality
but a larger file.

Hi!

 We have about 1000 leaflets in PDF format. 10% of those documents prints
with a black square instead of the picture.
All documents are made exactly the same way with Pagemaker 6.52. The only
thing that I know is that pictures are delivered to us in different formats
and that we then converts them to tiff.

Above happened when we changed printer. Before this we used a HP 8100
printer to print our leaflets till we where allowed to buy a OC 8465
printer.
Now on the new printer we got this problem.

System:

Windows NT 4
Photoshop 5
Pagemaker 6.52
Distiller

Christian Larsson

Okay, folks, I need some help with this problem that's getting very
annoying.

I had to make two PDFs from two issues of a small newsletter. After putzing
around for an hour or more, I managed to eke out a PDF one of the two
files, and I can verify that the fonts and one JPEG image were correctly
embedded.

I'm using a Mac G3 with OS8.5.1 and beaucoup de RAM and Acrobat 4.05 (the
whole suite)

I want to convert a made-from-scratch PM6.5 file, all two pages long, into
a PDF file. This is what I have done:
 
I write a PS file to the Distiller watched folder.

Distiller alertly sniffs out the visiting PS file and properly distills it
(as it shows on the progress thermometer when it reaches 100%)

Then when Distiller continues to the Relocating Files routine, it hangs at
0%. Nothing happens. I can still move the cursor, but I can't click on the
title bar to move the window or click the Pause button, nor can I switch to
another program running in the background. And if I have a background
routine in progress (e.g., printing a file), it also hangs. All I can do is
type Ctrl-Opt-Esc and force Distiller to quit.

This also happens when I export the file as a PDF directly from PM6.5. PM
properly invokes Distiller and attempts to distil the little fella, but it
hangs at the same spot.

Twice, I have gotten the error message in the Distiller window message pane
that it could not continue with the Optimize option selected. So I reset
the Optimize option in the Job Options dialog and continued.


Still, no luck.

The last time something like this happened, about four or five weeks ago, I
reinstalled Distiller and tossed the prefs, etc. At that time, I was
working with QXP 4.11 files (something I am not very familiar with), and so
I attributed most of the problems to what seemed to be a very clunky
process that QXP used to generate PDF files.

I'm at my wits end, and the Acrobat manual isn't much help. We have an
Adobe FAQ book, c. 1998, but like most other Adobe books, it looks
beautiful but the index is so piss poor that I haven't even tried to find
any help in it.

Thanks for any advice.

Jeremy,

I played with Options (David Evans' suggestion), and it does what you want.
Compose will also remove all encryption in a batch function--nice for me
because I already have Compose.

I wonder what Very Good Reason Adobe has for making it impossible to remove
all encryption using Acrobat's batch function?

Jeanie

I have over 30,000 PDF files that are encrypted. I have a security password
to change the file and I have changing the document not allowed set. What I
would like to do is batch process all of these files to clear the security
settings and turn off the encryption.

Right now using Acrobat 4.05 I can clear the security settings but my files
are still encrypted. So the security method still shows as standard. I need
this cleared. Does anyone know of a tool to do this?

I have a copy of Compose, but it requires to put the password in for each
document even though the passwords are all the same.  Is there a way around
this?

Dear PDF and Capture Colleagues,

We have a requirement with the Product Date Management (PDM) system we use to have one pdf file for viewing and archiving non-CAD documents. We have recently used an in-house department to scan some old documents from microfiche. We do not require OCR on these documents; OCR might be tough as depending on what method was used, our older documents include cut and paste and handwriting or hand-drafting. 

The problem we are encountering: We have been running into out of memory errors on the Windows 95 workstations used to process these documents.

Details on the files and their sizes follow (all identifying data has been obscured):

  18767562 Oct 31 12:45 61_1_e.pdf
  30811340 Nov  3 12:41 61_2_e.pdf

  26156370 Nov 21 12:38 58_2_b.pdf
  21201709 Nov 22 09:44 58_3_b.pdf

All suggestions are welcome as to how to combine these files into one pdf per document. We may not choose to implement them all. If the resulting combined file would exceed the maximum file size allowed for Acrobat or for one pdf, that information would also be welcome.

I am on the digest only. Please reply directly to me or copy your reply to me to ensure the timely receipt of your highly valued assistance.

Ouch. I don't use passwords, so I've not run into that problem. Options
says that you enter the passwords once and then the program stores them for
reuse instead of asking for them again...but I don't know if that means you
have to enter them once for each file, or once for each batch process.
(Download a demo of Options to test it.)

David Evans...can you answer this?

We just saw a demo of the revised Pitstop Professional from Enfocus 
(enfocus.com), it is a Acrobat plug-in that will allow you to add space
around a PDF. If you have a lot of files that need this, it looks like
it can even be scripted for automatic margin addition.

I have a copy of Compose, but it requires to put the password in for each
document even though the passwords are all the same.  Is there a way around
this?

Subject: PDF Question

All,

I'm implementing a toolkit for a web-based application, which uses PDF
bookmarks pointing to URLs. However, these bookmarks need to be added
dynamically at runtime, or, at least, I need to be able to concatenate
several PDF Documents, each with its own set of bookmarks into a single
large PDF. I looked at PDFLib, which doesn't support Web-link bookmarks,

and PJ and PjScript. I could implement the routines using PJ's low level

API, but I would prefer to use a higher-level API if one is available.
Do you know of such a toolkit which I can use ?  We're deploying on
Linux servers, so I would need something that can be accessed from Java
on Linux. That rules out all the Windows NT/2000 toolkits out there...

The basic function for above question would be for web users to make
changes to forms, currently, the user needs to download about 2 MB file
everytime the user wants to make a change  is there any compression tool

which you know of that can compress the size so that users do not have
to wait for the download.  anythoughts?
Thanks
Cesare

What is it you want to compress, and why is it so large?

Hello,

This may be a little off topic, but please bear with me.

Does anybody know of any application or tool that could go through a
Lotus Notes R4 or R5 database and convert various files in PPT, Word
DOC, etc... to PDF format automatically or an a scheduled basis (and
also update links to those documents).  I'm trying to find a way to
decrease bandwidth for Notes pages accessed via Notes Domino over a
variety of communications circuits.  Keep in mind that the Lotus Notes
file structure is different from a normal website - things that might
work with IIS, FrontPage, or Dreamweaver probably won't work here.

Thanks in advance,
Michael Kies

Hello,

This may be a little off topic, but please bear with me.

Does anybody know of any application or tool that could go through a
Lotus Notes R4 or R5 database and convert various files in PPT, Word
DOC, etc... to PDF format automatically or an a scheduled basis (and
also update links to those documents).  I'm trying to find a way to
decrease bandwidth for Notes pages accessed via Notes Domino over a
variety of communications circuits.  Keep in mind that the Lotus Notes
file structure is different from a normal website - things that might
work with IIS, FrontPage, or Dreamweaver probably won't work here.

Thanks in advance,
Michael Kies

	You want AppendPDF or AppendPDF Pro from Digital Applications 
(<http://www.digapp.com>).   They are command line applications which 
will happily merge/append PDF documents together maintain existing 
books and/or adding new ones.

	If you want an actual toolkit or library to do this, Digital 
Applications also provides their SPDF library, which is the 
toolkit/library on which their product are based.  It can be licensed 
either in binary or source.

Bob,

there is no documented method to add delays in script execution.

However, you might look at what exists in the Netscape Client-side 
extensions...

Hope, this can help.

Hello out there,
since there was no answer three weeks ago when I asked this question
first time it looks like I'm the only one in the world with the wrong
colored thumbnail effect... ;-)  Maybe I make something really principal
wrong?

When I try to create thumbnails with the Acrobat 4.05c for Windows (I
tryed on 95,98 and 2000, Win98 sometimes work) the colors in the
thumbnails don't match the colors in the pdf-pages. A white page
produces a grey pixeled thumbnail or even worse a light magenta. It
looks like the Acrobat picks up the colors of the page and chooses the
nearest color out of a 16 color palette which doesn't match very well.
The problem occors, when I have to create the thumbnails from the
already processd pdf-file and where a source (e.g. a Quark file) is not
available.  It occur also, when I send the pdf again through the
distiller, option "included creation of thumbnails" set.

The problem does not occur, when I have a source file like Quark-Express
and can produce pdf and thumbnails at once.

Thanks for any idea, Raimund

I can report that the same thing happens on my Windows 98
machine if I re-make the thumbnail. Still, never seen it on any
other document.

The area which goes a strange colour (more of a lavender here)
is a colour of 1,1,1 in a colour space
of CalRGB Gamma=0.222 WhitePoint=[0.9505 1 1.089]
Matrix=[0.4124 0.2126 0.0193 0.3576 0.7152 0.1192 0.1805 0.0722 0.9505].
I don't know if that is especially unusual.

No suggestions as to why, sorry.

Aandi

white does not print. or show on the screen.

Thanks Maury, Andy, Cy and others out there for thinking about,

I found out something:
When I pick up the "white" square behind the text of
http://www.schuitz.com/error.pdf with Enfocus PowerUp Tool it says it's
calibrated RGB. When I then convert it to CMYK I can delete and recreate the
thumbnail and it is correct.

The problem: I cant find a setting in Acrobat to say something like "pay
attention to RGB" and I cant convert all stuff in the big PDF-Files to CMYK,
they are already full of links, bookmarks and annotations and I would loose them
when I send the files again through the distiller. On the other hand, often a
source from where the pdf was produced is not available any more.
I'll contimue experimenting... :-)
Raimund

Thanks for Info,
I tryed "Global Changes of PitStop" and can convert the full pack.
Unfortunately the Acrobat honors this method only for some colors, e.g. white,
like in the first tests. Other colors even the conversion into cmyk doesn't
produce correct colored thumbs.
Looks like Acrobat has a bug here.

But is what Cy guessed the case? Is your page smaller than a full page size,
so it's using the colour to indicate the margins of your page? That doesn't
sound like a bug so much as an Adobe decision to indicate that using colour.
I thought it looked pretty impressive on the thumbnail, with the brackets
showing what I assumed were the margins of the page. If there was a problem,
I'd see it as Acrobat giving a thumbnail for an 8x11 page, regardless of the
size of the actual page.

You only get asked for each different password once, so only one
password request for each set of files sharing the same password.
Options checks which files need passwords before processing, so once it
starts the batch processing no more user input should be required.

Thanks for the idea, Wendy, but test page was full DIN-A4-Format (the
EU-standard Acrobat can handle pretty well). The lavender square behind the text
was a part inside the page for demo of effect.  I just will try out different
machines and combinations. When I find something I'll be back to the list with
result. From german technical support of Adobe I got the message, that they can
see the effect but dont have a solution right now.

Hi,

To me, it looks like an Acrobat bug. I distilled a simple text file as
screen-optimized and I used PitStop to change the tint of the calibrated RGB
to white. When I then created the thumbnails, lavender text appeared!

Conclusion: Calibrated RGB looks blue in a thumbnail.

PS. When you want to convert all colors in a document to RGB with PitStop,
it is better to use a "convert to RGB" action. You can find a predefined
actionlist at
http://www.enfocus.com/support/actionlistlib/actionlist-index.htm


Kind regards,

Hello all,

Petruska Clarkson has written a long and remarkable personal testament
in witness of her experiences of challenging the UKCP approach to
complaints. She's a very articulate complainant and her piece sheds
light on a variety of aspects of 'compliants/concerns/disputes that are
relevant to IPN.

You can find the article 'Open letter to Janet Boakes [UKCP chair]....'
at www.physis.co.uk/open.htm ... I've put up links to it on IPNOSIS and
G.O.R.I.L.L.A. and if her site is inacessible there is a downloadable
copy on G.O.R.I.L.L.A.

I had a clear reaction from Petruska's office yesterday that she could
do with hearing from anyone who is inclined to support her in her
whistle-blowing.

Greetings

Denis

Since your posting didn't explain what UKCP is, and since the posting
referred to IPN which I took as being Intellectual Property Network, I went
to read the reference you gave (http://www.physis.co.uk/open.htm) on the off
chance that it had something to do with the topic of this list.  It doesn't
-- it's an extremely long and rambling series of letters about someone's
intense dispute with the UK (British) psychotherapy establishment.  Please
don't send such completely off-topic posts to this list again.  Thank you.

__________________________________________________________________

Good day. I could use your help identifying which tools or plugins are
recommended for the work that I am doing. I work on Win98 but our IT
department wants me to graduate to Win2000. I am resisting because I know
that WinNT which Win2000 is derived from is not PostScript friendly. Is
anyone out there successfully creating very small PDFs under Win2000?

I create forms which our software's UI gathers the information/data for
and the logical model we create decides which forms to print and populate
the fields of. The end users of my forms will Never interact with the PDF-
only with the software's user interface which is browser based. The PDFs
are streamed to the client at the end of their session simply so that they
have a set of forms documenting the transactions they made in the
software. So I create intelligent PDF forms but not interactive ones.

My job has several major parts.

Part One - I create forms which are converted to PDF forms but also need
to be filled out by hand therefore I do not add drop down lists or other
GUI objects to these forms. Currently I am using MSPublisher 2000 because
it was available but will probably switch to a "PostScript" aware software
tool shortly such as Corel Ventura.

Part Two - PDFs are sent to me from sources that I have no control over.
These are forms to which I will be adding form fields. These PDFs have
often not been optimized for desktop printing. Looks like they turn the
press piece into a PDF and then think that will serve for desktop as well.
So paper sizes may not have been standardized - some of them even have
text that is clipped if "fit to paper" is not selected. They might have
bleeds or very large blocks of color (toner wasters) or page numbers that
are no longer accurate. I will need to try to fix these problems so that
the PDF forms can be printed to desktop printers.

Part Three - On occasion, I may need to scan some forms, create a PDF of
it and add form fields. The scanner is on the way but I assume some kind
of Acrobat plugin might be helpful here say for deskewing and making the
lines on the form of consistent weight, color and etc.

Part Four - Form Fields, forms field, form fields. Some of the PDFs
mentioned above might be several pages with a hundred or so form fields.
Right now I have to double click on each one to be sure that I've
appropriately assigned attributes, formatting and/or scripts. It would be
nice to find some kind of form field reporting software that would help me
manage and document all of these fields.

I am considering purchasing PitStop Pro. from Enfocus. I hope their
product will enable me to adjust the alien PDFs for desktop printing (Part
Two) plus assist with the form scanning (Part Three). But I'm not sure if
I need other software from Enfocus or if PitStop will do all that I need.
Or perhaps there is another vendor/product that would be helpful. The form
field reporting is VERY important. Anything that will help me manage all
these fields in a quick and easy way will be a great asset.

At this time, I am more interested in purchasing an off-the shelf solution
or two and won't be able to put in the time needed to analyze solutions
which developer contractors may offer to design.

What do you recommend? Please be as specific as possible:
Vendor/Manufacturer, Product, Product version, how you believe it will
help, website for more info., and etc.

Thanks for the input regarding my PDF specifications which I posted
earlier. It is still online http://www.concentric.net/~Ivyjeff/WebWorks/
if you'd like to take a look. I have yet to update it with the advice that
I received from the list. Most of which related to the Fonts section. The
recommendation was to remove the section regarding "never embed the Base
14 fonts". However, I may leave it in because I KNOW the demographics of
my user base and I'm trying to make my file sizes the smallest I possibly
can. I will test and research this further.

Thanks!

Remember this issue ???

About 8 - 12 months ago there was a lot of talk about a tiny white 
horizontal line that appeared through the text (on screen).

Resolutions were out there to use products other than Adobe Capture 2.01 
(at the time).  PageGenie was an application that addressed this issue 
successfully while Capture was taking a left turn to Capture 3.0 (NT based).

Well, interesting enough I have encountered some new twists.  I have not 
went out there (adobe or the web) and tried to figure out how many 
different versions of free Acrobat Reader there are, but I do know there 
are 2 versions that render different results.  Looking at these 2 versions 
listed below I found different results.


Version 4.05c 0705 16:28 - Use this version with single striped image PDFs 
and "white lines" appear.
Version 4.0 0513 09:57 - Problem resolved.  -  no lines.


The weird thing is that I thought by getting to the 4.05c version and 
staying current (webBuy) this would not be an issue.  I guess I am 
wrong...  Also makes you think about the issue if you are archiving PDF 
from paper and planning to perhaps use the Merchant/Webbuy options. I do 
not need a solution as I have it in the paragraph above.  But I do think 
about why we had to move away from a Adobe product.

I surely am not digging into this reason, but thought I would stir the pot 
a little as well as offer this interesting point to the one or two of you 
that have interest in this area.  Any insight back is appreciated, but not 
expected.

Happy Holidays-

yup. 30% more postscript errors on windows than on macintosh. do you have 30%
more time to complete tasks? No? then buy yourself a mac and start making
technology work for you, instead of you working around its limitations.
seriously, you will crash less and go home earlier if you move to macintosh.
enfocus pitstop will do what you want, but it will crash more often on windows.
(As proof, i have _NEVER_ crashed my mac wordprocessing. my pc's crash
randomly, whatever the task.)

I use Win NT for design and create pdf files and don't have a problem 
with postscript on NT. What do you mean by not postscript friendly - 
neither Macs nor PCs can display postscript natively and as far as I 
know you need Adobe Type Manager to deal with postscript fonts 
without hassles. One thing I have noticed is that computer 
administrators often make the mistake of installing a non-postscript 
printer driver - watch for that.

As for pdf tools - I don't do forms or anything - just try and get 
pdf files to service bureaus and as such don't really need pitstop or 
the like. However I have seen pitstop in action and it can get into 
pdf files and modify elements which is pretty impressive. I have also 
seen "Quite a box of tricks" and I don't know whether it does what 
you need but it might be worth a look.

Ivy,

Windows 2000 is a very smart way to go if you are currently on either
Windows'9x, Windows Me, or Windows NT 4. It is correct that Windows NT 4
was somewhat PostScript and Type 1 brain-dead. However, Type 1 and OpenType
font rendering is now integrated into the Windows 2000 operating system per
a joint project of Adobe and Microsoft. It is the most stable and reliable
of the Windows variants at this point and its font handling and PostScript
driver support is at least as good as if not better than MacOS 9.

There is no problem creating PDF files under Windows 2000 that you wouldn't
have under any other operating system environment.

Important caveat!!! Do NOT, I repeat NOT, do an "upgrade" from Windows'98
(or any other version of Windows) to Windows 2000. Do what is called a "clean
install" in which you effectively move all your data off your system, reformat
the disk, load the operating system, and then reload your applications. 
The Microsoft "upgrader" leaves too many "doggy droppings" on the system and
you will have problems from the first boot onward. These problems do not occur
with a clean install. Also note that a number of applications install differently
under Windows 2000 (or NT) than on Windows'9x. You really want them installed
such that they work correctly for Windows 2000.

I leave the other questions to be answered by other participants on this list.

        - Dov


cjmarch <prepress@goprep.com>,

I find your comments rather interesting. I suspect that you are somewhat of a
Macintosh "fan."

First of all, with regards to your claim of "30% more PostScript errors on Windows
than on Macintosh" ... What applications are you seeing this with? With applications
such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe InDesign, and Quark XPress, ALL the
PostScript is generated by the application itself, not the operating system and not
the driver. In the case of the Adobe applications, I can readily vouch for the fact
that the PostScript generation cross-platform is IDENTICAL except for the "setpagedevice"
commands at the start of the job and those are PPD file-based. And Adobe is not aware
of any 30% more PostScript bug problem with the Windows drivers. We should know because
Adobe provides the drivers for both the Macintosh (the LaserWriter and the AdobePS drivers)
and Windows (AdobePS for Windows'9x/Me/NT 4 and PSCRIPT for Windows 2000).

Maybe the problem you are seeing with regards to a large number of PostScript errors
has nothing to do with the platform the PostScript came from, but rather inexperience on
the part of newer customers you may have been encountering who are running on Windows
as opposed to the more traditional ones you have dealt with in the past who were totally
Macintosh-based.

Secondly, if you have a PC crashing "randomly, whatever the task" I respectfully submit that
either (1) your hardware is flaky and needs attention, (2) you are running Windows'9x or Me
and should really be running Windows 2000, or (3) your system is grossly misconfigured
somehow. But plenty of graphics professionals and enterprise users run under Windows
at least as effectively, efficiently, and successfully as those who run under Macintosh.
Personally, I run under both. Each has its own slight edge in certain areas. And both
have their quirks and liabilities. There is no question that the Macintosh has garnered its 
own cult with true-believers. The problem is separating the feelings from realities.

Cjmarch, you must work on poorly configured systems! The Adobe
PS/LaserWriter controls the generation of postscript. Adobe takes care of
making those. Both systems have their merits. Personally, content creation
for me is easier on the Mac. I have both Mac (OS 9.0.4) and a PC (NT4WS).
Both are extremely stable. When it comes to using Pitstop though, I think my
PC is much better in terms of speed and stability. You should contact a
competent Mac technician to examine your system, as well as a competent PC
technician.

Now to the point.

Ivy, I would suggest that you stay away from Corel products in general. I
have had a harder time using them more often than not. I would suggest
QuarkXPress first, and PageMaker/InDesign second. I highly recommend PitStop
Pro. You can change font embedding settings, down/up sample images and a
myriad of other things. Plus, with its actions list, you can create a script
of sorts to perform repeated tasks. Enfocus (http://www.enfocus.com includes
many actions already created for much of what you are looking to do. Very
much worth the money as it is such a powerful tool. I am not sure about what
to do for the last few questions. Feel free to contact me off list if you
would like.

yup. 30% more postscript errors on windows than on macintosh. do you have
30%
more time to complete tasks? No? then buy yourself a mac and start making

seriously, you will crash less and go home earlier if you move to macintosh.
enfocus pitstop will do what you want, but it will crash more often on
windows.
(As proof, i have _NEVER_ crashed my mac wordprocessing. my pc's crash

We have a Quark document which has a placed dark blue TIFF image
and some yellow text over it. We print to file and distill using
Distiller 4. On the PDF, there is a tiny white speck that shows
up where the text boxe(s) were. The spec seems to retain it's
size no matter what magnification the PDF is set to...any ideas?

We have also seen this problem, and , like Don, removed these points with
Pitstop. In tests, these did not output because they are just single points
with no fill or stroke, but they sufficiently scared our customer to make us
take them off. Our files were generated by Quark 4.11 with Adobe PS 8.7 to
Distiller 4.0

__________________________________________________________________

Hi list members,

Please excuse my longish inquiry. I have four PDF related question 
concerning our present project.

<Question 1>
Can an HTML link be made to open _a specific page_ of a PDF file?

<Question 2>
Is there an _easy_ way of adding a navigation interface, so that a series 
of _separate_ PDF files can be leafed through as though they were pages of 
a single PDF file?

<Question 3>
Can a link in a PDF file be made to open another PDF file to a specific 
page to a _new_ window?

<Question 4>
Is there a separate application that can be used to act as a TOC to the PDF 
files, that can be compiled relatively easily cross-platform?


<BACKGROUND INFO: the project> ------------------------

A colleague at the company I work for handles the production of a 900+ 
paged printed catalog for a mail/fax/web order PC parts vendor. This client 
now wants to make a CD-ROM out of the main part of the printed catalog--the 
description of the products, which take up over 90 percent of the volume-- 
to be given out to their potential customers.

Now, all the catalog pages are made with Quark Xpress 3.3-J. The products 
description pages, the main content of the CD-ROM, will be converted to PDF 
files.

Besides these PDF files, we need something for the search.

My colleague is considering HTML files. A top page, with a total of about 
25 main categories, such as CPU, Memory, Mother boards, Chasis, VGA cards, 
etc. etc. Clicking on a category will lead to another HTML page with a list 
of all the product names within the category-- maybe 20 or 30 entries. Each 
product name in this list would have two link buttons; one to yet another 
HTML page, the price chart for all products within the category, linking to 
the price entry of the product. The other button is to open the product 
descripton PDF file.

This is the problem. We want the PDF to be one file per main product 
category, since the customer will likely want to flip back and forth to 
other products within the same category. A normal HTML link will open the 
PDF file at its first page, but we want the PDF to open on the page of the 
specific product, depending on the link button pressed.


Thus, to <QUESTION 1> --------------------
Can an HTML link be made to open _a specific page_ of a PDF file?

I opened some PDF files as text and found that PDF defines object blocks 
and uses this to define link destinations. May be some sort of scripting 
code, like Java--of which I'm completely ignorant--, can be embedded in 
HTML to access this PDF code? If this is possible, is there some sort of 
graphical editor for this task, since we can't manage to manually look up 
hundreds of block codes of the PDF and type in the script/code one by one?


Taking a different approach leads to <QUESTION 2>  --------------------
Is there an _easy_ way of adding a navigation interface, so that a series 
of _separate_ PDF files can be leafed through as though they were pages of 
a single PDF file?

If the PDF were made into separate files per each product description, then 
we wouldn't have to worry about opening a PDF to a _specific_ page, as I 
asked in the previous question. But then, we need some setup to connect the 
separated files to act as though they were continuous pages of a single 
file.
I imagine adding link buttons in the page layout would be one way. But as 
the page layout is already full, we would prefer not to go back to the 
original Quark files and change the file size to add new buttons within the 
page.
The standard Acrobat interface does not work for this specific need--since 
the "Go Back" and "Go Forward" buttons/commands work historically and the 
Previous Page and Next Page buttons/commands work only within a single 
file--but perhaps a plug in that would add similar buttons on the menu bar 
that can be programmed for our purpose, something that would also enable 
the use of PageUp and PageDown keyboard buttons for the series of files 
would be ideal.


Yet another approach leads to <QUESTION 3>  --------------------
Can a link in a PDF file be made to open another PDF file to a specific 
page to a _new_ window?

The reason my colleague considered using HTML files in the first place for 
the top page, the list-of-products-per-category pages, and the 
price-list-per-category pages, is that PDF links seem always to open the 
new link in the same window _replacing_ the previous view. We want the TOC 
to always stay in a separate window, to be viewed at all times.
I know that, instead of using the "Open file" link property, if we used 
"Execute menu item" and selected the File Open command, the new file opens 
to a new window. But, this opens any file that was user-selected at the 
dialog, and is _not_ a link to a preset destination.


<QUESTION 4> is yet another approach  --------------------
Is there perhaps a separate application that can be included in the CD-ROM 
to act as a TOC to the PDF files, that can be compiled relatively easily 
cross-platform (Windows and Mac)?

Linking from either HTML or PDF TOC files would be our first choice, since 
they are both simple inexpensive cross-platform solutions. But including a 
separate TOC application--I don't know if this is the proper way to call 
it-- is also an option. It does _not_ need to perform a string search. It 
doesn't _not_ need to be linked to a database to search for products 
matching various conditions.
It simply needs to serve as a hyperlink TOC, as described previously (a top 
page with 20+ category listing; each category item is linked to a list of 
all products within the category; each product name in the category is 
linked to a HTML price chart and a specific page of the PDF file which 
provides the detailed product description). It would be ideal if the same 
app could be compiled into the Windows and the Mac versions, but we can 
have two completely different apps for each platform. Royalties to use it 
in a CD-ROM, if any, are also a major consideration.


<Using the standard BOOKMARK is the LAST option> --------------------
You maybe wondering, well why not use the standard bookmark? I think the 
bookmark, with the collapsing layer display, works great. But in our case, 
we have 25+ top headers each with 20 to 30+ entries, so going up and down 
the list and collapsing would seems too much trouble. A separate TOC 
window, as described previously would be much preferred.
At the same time, though, I'm not too optimistic whether there is a 
feasible solution for any of the four possibilities mentioned above. In 
this case, we would have to put the 2-layer TOC in the standard bookmark 
frame, make the HTML price list to PDF, and do everything in one Acrobat 
window.


Side note 1; I realize we might have more options if the original catalog 
were made with a different application, perhaps FrameMaker, since Quark 3.3 
seems limited in PDF and HTML output. But my colleague tells me that with 
the complexity of the layout--lots of graphics, lots of different layout 
patterns, manual adjustments to fit things to the page, etc. etc., it can't 
be done with Frame. He also tells me that Quark 4 may give us greater 
possibility with its plug-ins, but the 3.3J files cannot be converted to 
4J, for practical purposes.

Side note 2; In the future, from what I hear, converting the data to 
perhaps XML may be a great solution; for this we would need competent 
outside engineers and lots of analysis and preparation to set up a whole 
series of customized applications--a grand project indeed if we ever get 
around to it.

  --------------------

I've asked several questions; I'll greatly appreciate it if you can share 
any insight you may have on any of them. If you can reply, please also send 
the message directly to my address, since I'm on digest.

Thanks for your time.

Possible answer  to question 1:

Source for the script: here in the pdf-zone found some weeks ago: put the
following script as sample.ps in the Acrobat-dircetory  distillr\statup\
Pages will be marked when the are distilled so that you can use the link for
example    a href=test.pdf#Page4     (the word Page must beginn with Capital
Letter).

Unsolved problem: we didn't find a way for the user just to save that single
page on his/her hdd. Button "save to disk" starts downloading the complete large
file.

Question 1:
You can set a named destination in your PDF if you are using Acrobat 4.x.
For example, set page 356 as a the named destination "342abc" (you name the
destination whatever makes sense for you), and you can link to that
destination with an HTML link. Your HTML link would be
"path/document.pdf#342abc".

That method depends on you doing the work in Acrobat--not the most
efficient way if the PDF changes frequently . You would have to redo the
destinations every time the PDF is generated. You may also be able to add
named destinations by using pdfmark commands (pdfmark is an extension to
postscript code) in your original app. I have done it in FrameMaker many
times--simple process that creates the named destinations automatically
every time the PDF is generated. Another benefit is that if the text
holding the destination rolls to another page, the named destination rolls
with it. I know nothing about using pdfmark in Quark.

Question 4:
You could do this in PDF, also. We create a main menu in Frame that holds
links to all our manuals and create a PDF from it. Using pdfmark commands,
the links are set up in Frame and are generated with the PDF. No need to
fiddle with it in Acrobat. Again--I know nothing about Quark.


Your project sounds ideal for FrameMaker. Granted, making style overrides
to make something fit isn't the best way to use Frame, but making links
between files is a snap.

You didn't ask about putting your files on CD-ROM, but I hope someone else
comments about combining PDF files and HTML files on a CD-ROM. The HTML
files must be viewed in a browser, but the PDF files do not.

Hello,
    This is a question that covers Illustrator to pdf and print capable files. In
the past Illustrator files needed to have long paths cut in order to RIP the files.
Even files that were only going to pdf files would register a string length error
when opened in Acrobat. This week I was prepping a file on a Mac g4, Illustrator
8.1 and Acrobat 4 and entered the plit long paths command. When I viewed the result
there were no splits in my polygons.
Just to be on the safe side I ran the file through Illustrator 7 and the polygons
ended up being split. Will the new RIP's handle the non-split files and will
earlier versions of Acrobat Reader be able to view them?

Angus

 The standard Acrobat interface does not work for this specific need--since
the "Go Back" and "Go Forward" buttons/commands work historically and the
Previous Page and Next Page buttons/commands work only within a single
file--but perhaps a plug in that would add similar buttons on the menu bar
that can be programmed for our purpose, something that would also enable
the use of PageUp and PageDown keyboard buttons for the series of files
would be ideal.
... We want the TOC to always stay in a separate window, to be viewed at
all times.
I know that, instead of using the "Open file" link property, if we used
"Execute menu item" and selected the File Open command, the new file opens
to a new window. But, this opens any file that was user-selected at the
dialog, and is _not_ a link to a preset destination.


Ichikawa-san,

QUESTION 2 (Is there an _easy_ way of adding a navigation interface, so
that a series
of _separate_ PDF files can be leafed through as though they were pages of
a single PDF file? ...):

While my answer will not provide the solution that you want, I posted a
detailed procedure that solves a similar problem ("Duplicating Bookmarks
Across Files") in the July 23, 1997 issue of the PDF Discussion list
(http://www.pdfzone.org/resources/lists/pdf/199707/msg00256.html). The
procedure is a sort of "shell game" workaround that lets several files
appear to share a single set of bookmarks, in a single window. You are
correct, as I recall, that the "Go Back" button will not take you back to
the earlier file. For that, I created two fields: (1) a field on Page 1
that said "Go Back to end of preceding file," and (2) a field on the final
page that said, "Go to beginning of next file." But the Universal table of
contents, showing all sections of all files, remained in the bookmark pane
at all times. The procedure is rather long, so I'd rather direct you to the
archives than post it here.

A problem similar to yours appeared recently (on or about November 19):

>I looked at PDFLib, which doesn't support Web-link bookmarks,
>and PJ and PjScript. I could implement the routines using PJ's low level

Leonard Rosenthol   (leonardr@digapp.com) offered this solution:

You want AppendPDF or AppendPDF Pro from Digital Applications
(<http://www.digapp.com>).   They are command line applications which
will happily merge/append PDF documents together maintain existing
books and/or adding new ones.

If you want an actual toolkit or library to do this, Digital
Applications also provides their SPDF library, which is the
toolkit/library on which their product are based.  It can be licensed
either in binary or source.

QUESTION 4:

Our documentation department uses the same solution that Jeanie Shoemaker
described ("We create a main menu in Frame that holds links to all our
manuals and create a PDF from it. Using pdfmark commands, the links are set
up in Frame and are generated with the PDF." It works fine on our CD-ROMs
and on our intranet.")


By the way, Ichikawa-san, your company is fortunate to have a technical
writer who is so skilled and graceful at expressing ideas in English. Your
English is far better than that of many--I dare say, most--of the Americans
with whom I work.

This isn't really a bug so much as a limitation; n-up features
in printer drivers just can't work in every case.

In general, PDF files print n-up correctly using the PostScript driver
provided with Windows 2000. If you are using a separate driver provided
by Hewlett-Packard, that may be the cause of the problem and/or the
"emulated" PostScript Level 2 of those printers, or both.

Two questions I would appreciate help with:

Is it possible to add a watermark to a pdf file so that when a client prints
it the watermark appears on the printed copy only?

I want to route a pdf file to 3 or 4 people and have each person add
comments to the file and then pass it along. What is the best way to do
this?

Thanks
Joan

	There are some 3rd party plug-ins that provide this 
functionality, I believe.   Check PDFZone or PlanetPDF's database.

FWIW, earlier versions of Reader + MSPS driver never seemed able to do n-up
printing correctly, at least under Win95/98 (this to an HP 4Vm, real Adobe
PS).  Switch in the Adobe PS driver and it worked w/o a hitch.

You can do this using our Date Stamp plug-in for Acrobat. See our web
site for an evaluation version and further details.

You could use the text notes facility in Acrobat, with different
colours, perhaps, for different people. You can then summarise the notes
when finished into a separate file.

Kevin, 

InfoLinker, as Acrobat plug-in, can do this if your PDFs are Normal or Image
+ Hidden Text and there's a relationship between the text you have in the
text file and the text you are trying to bookmark in the PDF (the
destination).

Hello All,

Has anybody got a tip for creating relative links to quicktime moves. We
want to send a batch out on CD but the links, using the movie tool, keep
coming in absolute and therefore no good for distibution.

If you are creating a link from a PDF to anything, make sure that you open
the PDF with Acrobat (File > Open).  That let's Acrobat know what directory
you are in and hence allows for relative paths.  If you launch the PDF from
Windows Explorer, than Acrobat thinks the PDF is in the default Acrobat
directory and all pathing gets confused.

If there's a relationship of how the movie is referenced in the PDF and the
actual file name, our InfoLinker plug-in can automate this process.

How, exactly, are you verifying that the links are absolute?

__________________________________________________________________

We are working on a Mac and the server has a different path to the PC.  When
trying to view on a PC it comes up with the Mac path.  You can see the path
in the movies prefs dialog.

However using the example from Jose and opening the file via acrobat not
explorer (see previous message) sort of works but I am still getting cant
find file on PC.

Will Investigate

I think this may have to do with the difference between Mac and PC paths.

The pc uses \backslashes and the Mac uses :colons to delineate hierarchial
levels. I had to resave the files on the Mac to get them to work. So on the
hybrid discs I had two separate files on each volume.

The Mac does resolve the : and \ paths Ok that's part of Acrobat.  You can
use the same files on both parts of a hybrid disk without problem.  The
problem is that with the mpeg it remembers the whole server path.

I suspect that being able to highlight text at the end of a link/view can
be accomplished by Javascript within the PDF document.

This is the workflow I have in mind:

Enter a Text search > highlited text found (already featured in PDF) >
Linked to a zoomed view within a large map (vector) > "I want to highlight
a particular text field (one among many) at this final linked fixed zoomed
image (vector graphics)" > pop-up notes  > Link from highlit text to
picture.

Does anyone have suggestions/Javascripts to accomplish the above mentioned
workflow "text highlite" at the endpoint of a link?

__________________________________________________________________

Calling all experts, calling all experts. We had a couple of good ones
today. I received two PDF files today, via email. By default, they were
opened on a Mac (running system 9.0.4 with 384mb RAM, with Adobe
InProduction and 120 mb RAM allocated to it) and I received two error
messages that I have never seen before:

First file: 
The page started to display, showed a page dimension of 8.54" x 11.04".
Message appears: "An unrecognized token 'I7' was found." (click ok)
Message appears: "There were several parsing errors on this page." (click
ok)
The page goes to white.
I fit the page to window, deleted what appeared to be a white box, the page
dimension changes to 12.6" x 18.31" and some elements display. I "undeleted"
the "white" box and the brown page background reappeared. The page didn't
scale, it was just the artwork in the middle of a much bigger page.

Very bizzare. But wait, there's more... 

Second file:
Opened on the same system as above.
Page starts to display, message appears: "There was an error processing a
page. Too few operands."
The page goes blank. I end up with a document with two blank pages.

Here's the twist--the second file was opened on a PC running windows NT4,
with Acrobat full version (no InProduction)and gave the same "...Too few
operands" error. Both files opened on a PC running windows 2000 and the same
level of Acrobat as the other PC and no errors on either one, they both
printed fine.

I don't know what it all means yet, but you have to admit, this is
interesting stuff. Anyone have similar experiences? solutions? ideas? You
can't make this stuff up.

Rebecca,

This sounds very much like a problem caused by a faulty e-mail 
transmission where one station "believed" that the PDF documents were 
text files, and did some conversions. Have your client ZIP their 
files, and they should come in OK.

Hope, this can help.

Really?? I thought that was one of the beauties of PDF, being able to move
seamlessly from platform to platform? Thanks for the tip.

	Were the files sent stuffed or zipped, or send "raw" in the 
EMail?  If so, what program (name and version) did you use to expand 
the archive ?

	Were the files sent stuffed or zipped, or send "raw" in the 
EMail?  If so, what program (name and version) did you use to expand 
the archive ?

Rebecca,

The problem you encounter is not really a PDF problem. A PDF document 
can be moved from one platform to another one with no big problems. 
However, when the transport system messes up the files to be 
transported, there is not really anything we can do about it. Imagine 
the baggage handlers bashing your luggage to make it fit into a 
container...

Take care.

Hi there

I want to create a CD-ROM that utilises a Database or Database plug-in to
create a more refined search mechanism and produce results that link to PDF
documents. The database needs to run entirely from the CD-ROM and rely upon
no external applications. The CD will need to work on at least PC
compatibles and Apple Mac's? Ideally it will run on Unix and Linux systems
as well.

If this question does not make any sense please feel free to question me.

Thank you in advance.

Glyn Thomas

	Using what email clients on each end?

	SOME encoding took place (since you can't send binary files 
directly in EMail) - so that question is what kind took place 
transparently by the mail clients that perhaps got messed up by same.

I had exactly the same problem last week with a Quicktime. I created a PDF
which played a looping QT on page open, the movie file was one level down
from the pdf file it played in. It was working fine on the PC.

When I transferred the files to the Mac to check them, it would error saying
can't find the movie and ask me to search for the movie file. Once I pointed
it to the movie and resaved the file on the Mac it worked fine. If I took it
back to the PC the movie would error over there.

This indicates to me that something is going on with paths. Fortunately I
only had 1 PDF file with a movie and only about 20Mb of PDF's in total, so
it was a no brainer to set up different files on the hybrid disc, obviously
there are many scenarios where this would be impossible or impractical. So I
got around it, but didn't solve it.

I am using 4.05 on both Mac and PC. Anyone have any further ideas on this ?

"More refined" in what way, compared to Acrobat Search?

Do you have a big budget for this part of
the project project (five figures, say?)

Glyn,

If I understand you correctly, you are looking to make your PDF completely searchable going above the full text and index searching capability of standard PDF searches. Your options are limited if you are unable to develope the application yourself. 

Options
1. Buy the Adobe Developers Kit and create an add on or API with a database on the CD.
2. There are plug-ins available and other software packages that do this. We have used this with great and poor success. IMR has an application, but their support is poor and pray for no bugs in the final CD.
3. Contact an outside company that creates these types of CD's and already has done the development.

I rarely ever publicize our company on this list, but we can offer option three.

I hope this is helpful.

How can we get the corresponding bookmark index/ID from active page (PDDoc)?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am developing a plug-in for acrobat reader.In the case, I want to get the relationship of bookmark and current page. After I read all SDK documents, there is no issue found for solving this problem.
I think it may be solved by two approaches if they are possible.

First: If I get an active PDDoc by function "AVDocGetPDDoc" and its page
number, how can I get the corresponding bookmark index/ID?

Second: If I get bookmark root by function "PDDocGetBookmarkRoot", how can I obtain corresponding pages and their child's pages?

Thanks you for your kindly help!

Merry Xmas, 
API developer

	You should really post this to the PDFDev list, since that's 
where development questions belong.   However, let me see if I can 
answer it for you.


>I am developing a plug-in for acrobat reader.

	You know all about getting a Reader license and key, right?

	There is no "easy" answer to this because there does not 
necessarily have to be any relationship.

	Bookmarks are simply a UI element (mostly) that have actions 
attached to them - these actions can be (and in most cases are) "Go 
To Page" actions, BUT they could just as easily be anything from 
playing a movie to running a JavaScript.


>First: If I get an active PDDoc by function "AVDocGetPDDoc" and its page
>number, how can I get the corresponding bookmark index/ID?

	You have to walk the bookmark tree, get each bookmark's 
action, determine if the action is a GoTo, and if so, what page 
number and then compare the page numbers.


>Second: If I get bookmark root by function "PDDocGetBookmarkRoot", 
>how can I obtain corresponding pages and their child's pages?
>
	Same thing - get the action (PDBookmarkGetAction), get the 
type of action (PDActionGetSubtype) and see if it's GoTo.  If it is, 
then get the page number from the dictionary.

In the general case, the list of bookmarks and the list of
pages are independent. To find the "matching" bookmark,
or more than one, if any, you would scan the bookmark list
to find one referring to the current page.
>

Bookmarks are arranged in a tree. You walk the tree by 
walking all the children of the root, and their children,
and so forth, recursively.

Each bookmark has an action associated with it. Although
bookmarks usually have the action of going to a page in
the current document, they could have any action, like
open a URL or execute a JavaScript. After calling PDPageGetAction,
you have to examine the PDAction to find out what type,
if it is relevant, and if it is relevant, get the destination.

What is the general feeling about using JPEG compression with PDF's. I work
in a publishing environment (both editorial and advertising material) that
is coming to depend on PDF's. My concern is with using JPEG compression on
PDF files that are opened, edited in Acrobat and resaved. Though I have not
fully tested the results form multiple opens and saves my gut instinct tells
me that the overall image quality is going to degrade significantly in this
enivornment.

Right now my recommendation to my peers is to compress using Zip or no
compression at all to perserve image quality.

Please donate your two cents on this issue. Am I worrying about lossy
compression too much? Will Zip cause other problems in the processing and
delivery process? What are some of your experiences with compression and
PDF's?

Hi PDF specialists, 

we develop software solutions for highway and railway planning and 
many of our customers like to deliver their drawings as PDF. In our 
system you can colorize aereas using a "transparent" color but 
this color always comes out as opaque in the PDF. 

In the adobe KnowledgeBase there is a document saying this is 
only a problem of appearence on the monitor but that those colors 
will print out correct. That's not true. 

Is there a way to get PDFs with semi-transparent colors? 

Thanks for any suggestion,

Semi-transparency is not a feature of Acrobat 4.0.
The imaging model is always 100% opaque (or 0%).

Acrobat 5.0 will support this, we expect, but probably only
for PDF files created in Adobe Illustrator or "hand rolled".

	Assuming that your system writes out the objects as vector 
specifications (draw line, draw path, etc.) with color operators, 
than this is correct.  PDF 1.3 (the current version of PDF supported 
by Acrobat 4.x) does not support transparency - HOWEVER PDF 1.4, 
which is only supported by Adobe Illustrator 9 and some 3rd party PDF 
applications, does support transparency.

	You can either generate PDF 1.4 documents, and hope that your 
customers can take advantage of them, OR you will need to convert all 
transparent areas into raster/bitmap images.

In a straight "take this PDF and rip-it" workflow, JPEG encoding is just
fine.  This is a workflow where the supplier, not the printer, is
responsible for making any corrections.  If the supplier is sending garbage
PDF's and doesn't or can't make edits, then they should also supply the
creating files.  No matter what anyone says, it is always easier to fix a
problem at the source rather than bandaid it at the end.

FranzJosef--

This may not be the answer you're after, but if they are plans or drawings in pure line, you could rasterize them to a hi-rez, one-bit image and assign them colours in an app like PageMaker, Illustrator, CorelDraw, etc. -- the background (white) will then appear transparent both in print and PDF display. (but in some apps, like CorelDraw, you have to 'set' the fill of these bitmaps to 'clear' in order for the transparency to come through).

Multiple layering is supported by this method too. Because the compression for b&w is very high and lossless, you can achieve very good detail and printouts and still get PDF's of a manageable size. I suggest for most purposes, a rez. of 200-300 dpi.

Hope that helps.

We're working on a project where we have to produce PC formatted
CD's which contain a PDF and the Acrobat Reader 4 application.
I've read the rather lengthy instructions given for this at the
Adobe site...well, I'm wondering if anyone can break it down into
easy to follow steps for those of us who are PC challenged.

Here's what we need:
1.
PC formatted CD's

2.
PDF's will be version 4 (hotlinks, etc.)

3.
Doubleclicking the PDF on the CD should result in Acrobat Reader
launching directly from the CD, no matter how the user's computer
is set up.

Anyone have this process down, willing to share their simplified
instructions? Thanks a million.

Don

Yes, we have a plugin we developed internally to do just this task.
This enables us to do a proper QA of the bookmarks before release of
projects.
(Proofing on screen was unreliable and difficult in long bookmark lists).
I'm sure if we made such a tool someone else has made one too, to sell or
share.
Sorry I can't do either, but did want you to know it can be done pretty
easily.
On a positive note...

Unless they are opening the PDF files, somehow copying the images OUT of 
the PDF file, editing the images, and then pasting the new images into a 
PDF file, you "gut instinct" is wrong - simply openeing a PDF file and 
editing it will not "recompress" the images differently - in fact, you 
can open and close a JPEG file in Photoshop hundreds of times without any 
degradation - it simply writes it back to file the same way - now, even 
if you do some cloning in an small area, Photoshop will NOT 
RESAMPLE/RE-JPEG the entire image - the only case where SERIOUS repeated 
open/edit/close degradation will occur is when you crop an image, as it 
has to re-tile the entire image - and this is Photoshop, not Acrobat - 
even if you recrop the PDF, and even if a crop corner is in the middle of 
one of the images, when you save, Acrobat will NOT resample or re-JPEG 
the image.

This is a different issue - any amount of JPEG will degrade any image - 
even Maximum quality will "toss" image data which cannot be recovered - 
however - when i worked for a printing company, we did a series of tests 
with customer files - we created PDF files with all the level of JPEG 
compression available and printed each on press and laid them side by 
side.

100% of the time they selected the samples that had Maximum Quality 
compression applied to them, and we were totally suprised - they selected 
this OVER no compression - we then discovered that the very small amount 
of JPEG artifacts arond the contrasty areas of the images were percieved 
as USM (Un Sharp Masking) and the customers seemd to feel this was 
"better" than the less "sharp" example (the examples with no compression)

so, in this study, our customers liked the Maximum Quality setting 
compression better than ZIP or No compression.

when they also discovered that there was a minimum of a 10 to one file 
size difference, well, that sealed the deal (remote transmission cost 
issue) - Max Quality compression was what they selected - Black and white 
images seemed to be even more forgiving, so we select High Quality for 
this - 

this was JC Penney type work too - fashion, fabrics - what can i say, the 
customer is ALWAYS right, even when you have to figure out why.

Platform to platform, yes, ignorant email application to even more 
ignorantly set up ISP, SMTP and POP servers, no.

don't blame a file format because a stupid application or system does not 
understand it. I have seen StuffIt files try and unstuff on the server 
when they should simply transfer. This is not PDF fault. Hey, i can even 
delete the .pdf from MIME in Navigator, and get rid of the plug-in, and 
the PDF files open as text in the browser.

Want it to be like the Mac, eh?

No, you can't have that.

Unlike the Mac, to double click, the controlling application
must already be installed to the hard disk.

You can include the Acrobat installer and offer to install
it; OR you can set up an autorun that starts Reader and opens
a single specific CD of your choice.

Bear in mind that for many users, a CD is "broken" if it
doesn't autorun something on the PC. They just don't know
what to do next.

In response to a similiar query on this list a couple of years ago, we
produced a free plug-in to count the number of bookmarks in a PDF file and
copy them to a simple ASCII file.

If you'd like to give it a try, I've just put it on our website, but the
only way to get it is through this link:
http://www.pdf-solutions.com/countbookmarks.zip

It is without frills, or even an install program, so just extract the
countbookmarks.api file and drop it into your Acrobat plug-ins directory.

Rebecca,
This sounds very much like a problem caused by a faulty e-mail
transmission where one station "believed" that the PDF documents were
text files, and did some conversions. Have your client ZIP their
files, and they should come in OK.
---------

I would attack this problem on two fronts, each involving Acrobat
Distiller:

1. Many email systems have problems passing large files. Some can reliably
pass files as large as several megabytes; others cannot handle files larger
than about 500K without corrupting them. If Max is correct--that the email
system is at fault--I would suggest a different route: Ask the person who
created the PDF file to Open Distiller > Job Options >General, and select
the ASCII Format checkbox, then redistill the original postscript file. The
resulting PDF file will be, on average 20 percent larger; text-heavy files
add more overhead than graphics. But this file will be far more likely to
survive an email system intact.

If the creator has invested a good amount of time postprocessing the file
in Acrobat Exchange, s/he will be to preserve these features by creating a
new PostScript file without links and bookmarks, then replace all the
original file's pages, performing what I call a whole body transplant. I'm
not sure this would be wise, however; I'd want the links, bookmarks,
thumbnails, and so on to be ASCII-encoded as well.

The creator can still follow Max's advice as well and ZIP the new file, to
save upload and download time. But if the goal is simply to get the file
from A to B intact, ASCII encoding alone may well do the trick.


2. In the Distiller printer driver, have the creator select the Postscript
tab and make sure the PostScript output format is set to PostScript
(optimize for portability - ADSC). Many people are unaware that their
PostScript is still set at the default setting, "optimize for speed."

	My real situation is: Before user read any pages by scrolling,
typing in pagenumber and clicking bookmark, my API should know 
corresponding bookmark title (Book's Chapter).  I have try to read all 
bookmark tree but there is no insight to get corresponding pages(except
user just clik bookmark), since bookmark in reader is just like a navigator
for user clicking.

Thanks you!
Leo

	OK, so what's the problem?  You start at the root of the 
bookmark tree and then walk it going through children, siblings, etc. 
Do you understand what this means?


>I have try to read all
>bookmark tree but there is no insight to get corresponding pages

	Sure there is - just like both Aandi and I described it! 
Once you have the PDBookmark, you get it's PDAction, which can then 
tell you the Subtype, which if it's a GoTo has a page number 
associated with it.

	Have you read the PDF specification yet to understand how 
this stuff gets into a PDF document?  Have you opened up a PDF and 
looked inside it?

Leonard, excuse my ignorance but...

What are "siblings"? (Never heard it before.. a quick explanation will do...
if possible)

__________________________________________________________________

Aandi, Bob, Leonard, Max,

thanks for all your quick and competent answers --- I guess I'll have 
to wait for Acrobat 5.0 / PDF 1.4. What makes me wonder is:

- InDesign 1.5 creates transparent colors even if I generate the PDF 
with the Distiller Printer (win2k).

- A tool named "O.R.I.S. page" which I downloaded (www.cgs.com) 
as demo yesterday, lets me open the PDF with the opaque colors, 
pick the relevant object and define a transparency between 0 
(nothing) and 100 (opaque) percent.

So, it obviously _can_ be done whether by hand (which is no 
choice for our customers) or using the distiller 4.0 (win2k) printer 
driver. There must be a way to communicate with the driver and tell

Again, thanks and

Don,

We have a product called LibraryManager that will:
1. setup the CD to autorun
2. detect if Reader or Acrobat is on the PC and if not install it.
3. allows for a fyi splash screen
4. presents the user with a listing of the PDFs on the CD, by title or
whatever you want.  This display can also contain your company logo at the
top.
4. allows for PDF links across multiple CD libraries.

Check it out on our website and contact me directly for further info.

Subject: [PDF] PDF/Acrobat on CD for PC


We're working on a project where we have to produce PC formatted
CD's which contain a PDF and the Acrobat Reader 4 application.
I've read the rather lengthy instructions given for this at the
Adobe site...well, I'm wondering if anyone can break it down into
easy to follow steps for those of us who are PC challenged.

Here's what we need:
1.
PC formatted CD's

2.
PDF's will be version 4 (hotlinks, etc.)

3.
Doubleclicking the PDF on the CD should result in Acrobat Reader
launching directly from the CD, no matter how the user's computer
is set up.

Anyone have this process down, willing to share their simplified
instructions? Thanks a million.

Don

No, it CANNOT.  I don't usually like to be definite, but this
is one case where I can be sure that the PDF specification
does not include semi-transparency. Believe what you have been
told.

What you may be seeing is one of the following:
1. Producing a result which pre-mixes the colours so as to
give the illusion of transparency. You have been able to do
this in Photoshop for years. Transparent when designing, but
fixed once saved.
2. If it is for screen only, a plug-in could in theory mix
colours that are already in the frame buffer.
Tricks, in other words. Tricks may be good enough!

We've been updating several pdf files on the web and sometimes when we
download a file, the older revision of this pdf is displayed.
Does anyone knows why it occurs even cleaning the temporary files of browser

Do Acrobat (4.06) or Reader have a internal cache control? If exists, where
do I can get information on that?
Thanks

The problem is that we don't want anything to be installed on any
computer. We need to be able to create CD's that contain the PDF(s) and
Reader. The idea is for the user to double-click the PDF and have Reader
run right off the CD.

Typical situation:
User has Reader 3 installed on his or her computer. We send them the CD
and they double-click the PDF(s) and Reader launches on the CD,
displaying the PDF(s)...nothing gets installed, and their own Reader 3
doesn't jump in and mess things up.

Is this possible?

Don

__________________________________________________________________

No, neither Acrobat nor Acrobat Reader cache files between explicit
opening of files. HOWEVER, your web browser may cache files (you've
already investigated that) and some ISPs actually cache web sites,
pages, and files. One would hope that such cacheing would be intelligent
enough to validate differences in file attributes such that purge and
refresh would occur correctly. Another possibility is that the host of
your web site has multiple servers responding to web page and file requests
and that it takes some time for them to be fully in synchronization with the
latest copy of content that you push out to your official web site location.
Check with your ISP and/or web host for more detailed information.

__________________________________________________________________

The reason you are using Capture is because your are converting "images" to
PDF format. (You are starting from paper..)

To convert MS Word, RTF, WordPerfect, etc. or any kind of electronic file to
PDF you have to use either PDF Writer (the easiest one..) or Acrobat
Distiller.

PDF Writer is a printer driver that comes with the full version of Acrobat
(by now, 4.0). Just do "print to PDF Writer" from any aplication and you'll
get a PDF file.

You don't need to do "Image + text" PDF's but "normal" PDF's. (That is,
completely electronic text). If you wish, you may embed the original fonts.

After converting the docs to PDF, they'll be as searcheable (probably more)
than the others (Image + text).

If you want to search them ALL at once, build an index using Catalog
(included in Acrobat 4.0 also)

When I read my post, I realized I did not say what I had wanted to, =
sorry.  By using Acrobat PDFwriter, I can convert an individual document =
to a PDF document that is searchable, but I need to automate the =

Well, this is a big problem, because you can't do that on
Windows, as I think I might previously have said. You must 
revise your expectations for this project, or stick to Macs
where it is possible.

You can have Reader on the CDROM.
You can have Reader start and read a PDF.

You cannot control what happens when double clicking files
in Windows Explorer EXCEPT by installing software to Windows. 
That is how Windows works.

	I would suggest looking at a 3rd party product such as 
PDFDocConverter (<http://www.activepdf.com>) which is designed for 
batch conversion of "office" documents to PDF.

The discussion about  "Image + text" PDF's or "normal" PDF's would depend on how
important exact replication is to the user.  Correct?  For example, insurance
documents (with images) would most likely use "Image" PDF's rather than "Normal"
PDFs because the need for exact replication of the document is important in
order to comply with state filings.  My point is to be careful on selecting
"Image + text" or "Normal" PDF formats.

The reason you are using Capture is because your are converting "images" to
PDF format. (You are starting from paper..)

To convert MS Word, RTF, WordPerfect, etc. or any kind of electronic file to
PDF you have to use either PDF Writer (the easiest one..) or Acrobat
Distiller.

PDF Writer is a printer driver that comes with the full version of Acrobat
(by now, 4.0). Just do "print to PDF Writer" from any aplication and you'll
get a PDF file.

You don't need to do "Image + text" PDF's but "normal" PDF's. (That is,
completely electronic text). If you wish, you may embed the original fonts.

After converting the docs to PDF, they'll be as searcheable (probably more)
than the others (Image + text).

If you want to search them ALL at once, build an index using Catalog
(included in Acrobat 4.0 also)

Just print to a postscript file and distill the resulting postscript file using Acrobat Distiller. This works for all desktop applications. With RTF, do likewise (I would use Word for the best results as RTF is their format). This will result in fully searchable PDF's with one caveat. Others on this list, or the list's archives, can point you to the specific font issues that can arise from True Type fonts.

I don't own AutoCad. I need to know if it is possible to convert AutoCad
files to PDF using Distiller or any other means.

Also, my client has a large number of AutoCad files that have been saved as
.dwg files. Can these be converted to PDF without reopening them in AutoCad?



TIA,

	The only program that I know of that MIGHT do the job, as it 
handles lot of other file formats, is PDFDocConverter 
(<http://www.activepdf.com>).

Hi,

We have users who need to place version 4 PDF's into Quark
documents that may or may not have to be passed along to PC users
to work on. Right now our users have PDF Filter 1.4, which only
allows you to place version 3 PDF's. If we give our Mac users PDF
Filter 1.51 so they can place version 4 PDF's, will the next user
(probably on a PC) be able to work on that document? Will the PC
user need an updated PDF Filter also?

Thanks for the URL, but that's the guide I referred to in my
first post. 69 pages are too much for your average production
person. I need it broken down into easily digestable
chunks...like a step-by-step list of instructions.

Bob, I think there's been some misunderstanding here.

When I say:

> You don't need to do "Image + text" PDF's but "normal" PDF's. (That is,
> completely electronic text). If you wish, you may embed the original
fonts.
>
> After converting the docs to PDF, they'll be as searcheable (probably
more)
> than the others (Image + text).

I'm referring to originally electronic docs exclusively, and not to
originally paper docs. I would not give advice in that sense.

Of course when you start with paper docs, you have to do a couple of
elections. One of them is to choose between "Image+hidden text" vs "Normal",
depending, as you say, on the tipe of job but, when you start with
electronic docs, there's not text to hide.

... and the question, if well understood, refers exclusively to electronic
files (Wordperfect, RTF, MS Word, etc)

I hope it's clearer now.

Carlos.

Orig. question

  Subject: [PDF] Converting WordPerfect, MS Word and RTF (Rich Text =
Format) to PDF "Hidden Text"


  Hi PDF group:

  I am presently using Adobe Capture 2.01 to convert paper documents to =
searchable documents using Acrobat PDF (Image + Hidden Text).  It is =
very searchable.  I have thousands of files in WordPerfrct, MS Word and =
in RTF (Rich Test Format) that I would like to convert to the same =
(Acrobat PDF (Image + Hidden Text)) format, or at least in a searchable =
form that is compatable with Acrobat PDF (Image + Hidden Text).

  Could someone point me to a reference or a procedure?

  Thanks for any information.

Bob, I think there's been some misunderstanding here.

When I say:

> You don't need to do "Image + text" PDF's but "normal" PDF's. (That is,
> completely electronic text). If you wish, you may embed the original
fonts.
>
> After converting the docs to PDF, they'll be as searcheable (probably
more)
> than the others (Image + text).

I'm referring to originally electronic docs exclusively, and not to
originally paper docs. I would not give advice in that sense.

Of course when you start with paper docs, you have to do a couple of
elections. One of them is to choose between "Image+hidden text" vs "Normal",
depending, as you say, on the tipe of job but, when you start with
electronic docs, there's not text to hide.

... and the question, if well understood, refers exclusively to electronic
files (Wordperfect, RTF, MS Word, etc)

I hope it's clearer now.

Carlos.

> The discussion about  "Image + text" PDF's or "normal" PDF's would depend
on how

Orig. question

>(Rich Test Format) that I would like to convert to the same (Acrobat PDF
>(Image + Hidden Text)) format, or at least in a searchable form that is

I've distilled postscript files from several different CAD software
packages. You will need to know the size of the AutoCAD drawing as it
will likely not be your default distiller setting.

If you have the size right, it works beautifully. Occasionally, I've
had to rotate pages (but I've had to do this with FrameMaker and Word
too, so they all equally bother me).

Also, my client has a large number of AutoCad files that have been

Yes.  You can export postscript files from AutoCAD.  The postscript files can be
distilled.  Unless there is a reliable batch conversion utility to convert dwg
to postscript, each drawing will have to be opened and exported separately.
Hijaak Pro is capable of batch conversions like this but I have had inconsistent
results with it.

There is a free viewer from Autodesk called Volo View Express. It will open

if you are on a mac, cadmover is an app. that can convert dwg. files to postscript,
illustrator, etc. i dont know about scripting it, but i think applescript would do
an excellent job of auto-processing 'batch' files. hope this helps.

Lynn (and others),

there are a few issues with PDFs from CAD documents. One is curves, where 
the CAD world uses a different mathematical model than the illustration world 
(including PostScript and PDF). This means that it is not guaranteed that curves 
can be represented at the needed precision.

However, this difference in the mathematical model for curves becomes purely 
academic when the output module is involved. CAD drawings are essentially set 
up for outputting on vector devices (plotters). With some few exceptions, plotters 
do not know how to draw curves (if they do, the driver must also know about 
that). Instead of curves, the printer/plotter driver produces a polygon. As far as I 
have seen, all the PostScript drivers will create polygons. The consequence is 
that instead of a curve path with a few ponts, you will get a polygon path with 
several hundred lines. The resulting PDF will then display very sluggishly, 
something which can become annoying in a complex drawing, such as 
explosion drawings. When bad comes to worse, it imay even be that those line 
elements are not even connected, but just individual very short straight lines. 

The next issue is very often that text is not represented as text, but as a bunch of 
lines, which happen to look like letters and numbers. The resulting PDF is then 
definitely not searchable, for example.

So, getting CAD drawings to PDF is not necessarily as easy as it appears. So 
far, I have not heard of any converter which takes properly care of the above 
issues (but I will more than happy to hear that there are tools out there which 
have addressed the problems).

Hi everyone,

Although we typically set up our default printer to the Adobe Distiller
which most of the time is adequate for DWG conversion to PDF. Alternately,
we have also had very good success merely by a copy / paste directly into
Adobe Illustrator.(Note: You have to have your background set as white in
Autocad to do this. Colors and everything imports directly.) Once in
Illustrator, you can then convert the drawing into a PDF or whatever format
is desired. By doing this, it has been my experience that I can manipulate
drawing, as required for documents that we make, very quickly. 

Addressing the situation that Max pointed out, where Autocad is vector
driven, you can export the original drawing file as a Autocad R14 DXF file,
which you can open in Illustrator. (Illustrator can convert these DXF
files.) The text directly imports as text, the circles also are circles,
lines, and the like, can easily be modified as desired. From here the
drawing then can be directly saved as a PDF. You may loose some items during
the conversion, pending how the drawing was made, but it does work well for
the most part.

Hope this is helpful information and enjoy the holidays!

Martin,

thanks for the update. You say that with copy/paste, circles come in as circles. 
Well, circles are almost never the problem. Even closed ellipses are not. But 
what about cut ellipses, which you have lots of in axionometric etc. views?

Hello,

we're using the cgi-script 'byteserver.pl' from Adobe since a longer
time.
Is it still the standard for quick page serving to view the first pages
while downloading the rest even when bookmarks are hit to access pages
at the end of the file first   or   do modern browsers and latest Apache
servers manage it anyhow alone without the byteserver.pl script?
Thanks for info, Raimund Schuitz

Recent versions of Apache support the Range request header from HTTP/1.1
(which is all byte serving is) as well as the Request-Range header for
compatibility with old browsers. See:

http://www.adobe.com/support/techguides/acrobat/byteserve/byteserv03.html

Alternatively, check the source code! For Apache, look in
src/main/http_protocol.c for ap_set_byterange().

Cheers,

Chris

Max, Martin and others,

Illustrator 9 will open both dwg and dxf files. When opening the dwg you 
get the option of merging layers or not, and uniting separate paths. 
Uniting paths will connect all those pesky segments but you still have a 
zillion points on the path. This can be dealt with by carefully using the 
simplify path option. There are probably some gotchas with this method as I 
have not had the opportunity to thoroughly test it.

Hi,

Does anyone have any information on how, or if, a Filemaker Pro v.5
database could print out a field that could be understood by Acrobat to be
a bookmark? Also, another field to be a live www link?

I have about 1,000 records that I want to print from Filemaker into
Acrobat, but I don't want to do each bookmark and link by hand!

Thank in advance,

Liz

Thanks very much for the update. We only have 8.0 and the info we had

	The only way that I can think of to do this would be to use a 
3rd party library and some custom software - but yes, it can be done 
with the right tools.

Hello,

    I'm trying to use the form tool to create an action that opens up an =
email account which fills in the "To" line to the requested address. I =
did manage to successfully make this happen using JavaScript =
"app.mailMsg(true,"name@address.com");". This actually did work when =
testing on my hard drive, however, after burning a CD I got an error =
message stating that "App.mailMsg is not supported for this =
configuration, including Reader Macintosh, and UNIX".

    Also, I have the CD set up to Autorun, when I access the file from a =
start menu, that is when I get the error message. However, when I open =
up the file from the CD drive it opens the email message as desired.

    Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, thanks,

__________________________________________________________________

I have both Latin and Greek manuscripts (very old) that I would like to convert to PDF but when I import the image into Exchange, it doesn't convert to any searchable text. I assume this is because it doesn't recognize the font or characters.  Can anybody give me some guidance on how to convert these old manuscripts to PDF so that they are text-searchable?  I also would like to create a Catalog for many manuscripts that is also searchable.  If I use the Library of Congress catalog number as part of the keyword field, does that mean those keywords are also index searchable via catalog?
Please provide as much insight as possible and thanks in advance.

For Autorun you will be using the free Reader, I'm sure.
In this case the message is perfectly true - you cannot use
this method in various configurations, including Reader.

Importing to Exchange NEVER makes searchable text by itself.
You would have to use Paper Capture.  But Paper Capture will
require clear, clean printing in a supported language.  I've
never heard of OCR for Latin or ancient Greek, and if they
are handwritten, there is no chance at all. 

Well, you can retype.

Yes, but the searcher must choose the "Show fields" option.

Dear Mr Furbush,

Are you, in fact, dealing with handwritten manuscripts (or facsimiles 
thereof) or printed
renditions of manuscripts? If the latter, see the response to a 
question similar to
yours from the list, LEXI. I suggest you subscribe to that list, 
where you will find
scholars dealing with your problem. You might want to contact Prof. 
Kraft directly.

Also try http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/tllHome.html or
http://www.hnet.uci.edu/classics/ or
http://www.hnet.uci.edu/classics/ or
http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/classicsDept/resources.html

If you are dealing with handwritten manuscripts, the problem is more difficult.
Have the manuscripts been edited and published? That is, could you scan an
image of the manuscript and the text for searching from a printed source?

Subject: Re: scan program for ancient Greek

The best scanner facilities for classical Greek that were available some
15 years ago were the German MicroLogic system (called something like
"Optoram") and the Kurzweil scanning system -- both of them trainable and
capable of respectable results with clear fonts (yes, they could read the
accents and other diacritical markings as well). I think they may both
still be around, but I haven't been keeping up. Check for internet
addresses?

Dan,

The mailMsg() method works only in a full version Acrobat Viewer 
component, as you find it in the full Acrobat version, or the 
Business Tools.

What you could do instead is use the getURL() method with the mailto: 
parameter.

Also, it could be that your standard installation on the test machine 
is not complete, or up-to-date, whereas when you run Reader from the 
CD, you have an updated version.

Hope, this can help.

__________________________________________________________________


Our Office uses Netscape Communicator Version 4.74 on a
Windows 2000 server (approx. 17 thin clients).  We have
installed Acrobat Reader version 4.05b.

We have created a Handbook that contains links to
several PDF that have mailto FDF enabled.  (To submit
time off requests, time cards, etc...)  However, when
the handbook is opened in the acrobat reader (not in a
browser) format, when the user clicks on the submit
(mailto) button, the following message appears: 

"You need to be running inside a web browser in order
to submit this form"

So we have opened the pdf in the browser and when we
click the submit, the status bar has a message,
"contacting host: [hostname]" for about 3
seconds....and then nothing.

best case solution:  How do I get the PDF, when open in
Acrobat Reader (not browser) to trigger the email
message with the submit (mailto:) button.

We'll take what we can get solution:  We will open up
the PDF in a browser and have the mailto trigger the
email to open.

Not ever going to happen solution: Installing the full
Acrobat PDF creator on the Server.

All suggestions are appreciated, 

Thank you and Happy New Year,

__________________________________________________________________

Let me tell you how I solved this one:

I use Macromedia Director to create a small (320x240 pixels) 
application to call the appropriate PDF and Acrobat. Actually, in my 
case. the application also allows for selection of full screen or 
Acrobat control versions of the same PDFs. I successfully create MAC 
and PC versions of the Director projectors.

There are some other issues. You must have licenses for Director for 
PC and MAC (expensive) and you must make sure that you close the 
Director projector after opening Acrobat (memory). There are Director 
Xtras which give you more control but I haven't use these myself.

Jim,

This is indeed true; with Reader, the submit function works only when 
Reader runs under a browser. However, you could use the getURL() 
JavaScript method with the mailto: parameter instead. This will open 
the browser _ besides_ Acrobat (Reader), which will then open the 
mail client which has been specified in the browser. Depending on the 
parameters your mail client can handle, you can pass more than just 
the To value.

Hope, this can help.

Hello,

using Adobe Catalog to index pdf data I included the option "incl.
numbers" because my pdf file contains plenty of item numbers I want to
search for.
Any chance to make Acrobat Reader/Catalog understand that item "222 333
444" is the same as "2 223 334 44"  and the same as "222333444" ?
Thanks for info,
saison greetings :-)

Raimund,

the standard procedure is to "normalize" these numbers using hidden 
text. When you have control over the source documents, you can do 
that already there, if you have only PDFs, you would use a production 
plug-in to do this.

A production plug-in is normally custom made or customized. A good 
source for such plug-ins is Marc Vron (http://www.veron.ch), who has 
years of experience with PDF based catalogs.

Hope, this can help.

Catalog/Search are based on indexing words, not character strings. 
By selecting "include numbers" you just say that numbers are
to be treated as words.  But there is no option to run words
together e.g. to treat ab acus and abacus as equivalent.

When I Drag and Drop the file into Distiller, I get a xxxx.log file instead
of a xxxx.PDF file.  Could you offer a pointer (or two or three)?  I have
Distiller open on the desktop.

Thanks

Marti, you should be getting both of them. Distiller uses a log file to
explain what it did.

I don't know what machine you're using, and which Acrobat version.

Besides, you need the original app. of the files installed. Distiller needs
to open it in order to make the pdf

Carlos

I have tried it many times with both MS Word (.DOC) files and WordPerfect
(.WPD) files.  I only get the .log files.

I am using a Compaq 7000T running on Win Me

I was using Acrobat 4.0 but also have Acrobat 3.0

Yes I do have the original application of both MS Word 2000 and WordPerfect
8 (Suite 8)

Thanks for the assistance (you must monitor this 24-7!)   ;-)

What does the log file say? (open it to see)

Acrobat 4 is ok. I hav not used Win Me but I wouldn't say that's the
problem.

How are you opening Distiller?
Opening Start->Programs->Distiller does not work for me. It only produces a
log file saying it "flushed" the job away.
Try opening distiller from the printers folder
(Start->Config->Printers->Distiller) and drop it there.

Regards,

Carlos

	You're not trying to drop a Word or WordPerfect file on 
Distiller, are you?  That COMPLETELY wrong!    Drop those files on 
top of the Acrobat icon (or into the Acrobat window), and Acrobat 
will try to convert them for you.

	Distiller ONLY DOES Postscript!

YES! -- When I open:  Start->Settings (Config)->Printers->Acrobat PDF
Writer; It works!  That was the trick.  Thanks a lot!

I noticed that on the couple of documents that I processed, it truncated the
name.... any thoughts on that?  I will be trying more a little later.

But, thanks again Carlos and Leonard.  Got it to work!

Leonard, I agree with you. Distiller is supossed to do ONLY certain things. But
the reality is that it does others. I find Distiller a tricky device, that
doesn't always do what you need and sometimes, does other things it is not
supossed to.

By the way, when I drop a file on top of the icon (Acrobat 4) or into the
Acrobat window, I get a msgbox "Error opening. Acrobat does not start by %PDF".
I know is supossed to work that way but my private reality is it doesn't. I
don't know why, but it doesn't. This is why sometimes a non "orthodox"
workaround is desirable (mostly if it works).

Well, however this is done, it belongs to the last century. Let's hope Adobe
brings us a huge wish list in the form of Acrobat 5.0

...and Marti, I don't monitor the list 24/7.

I do it 25/7 because it's the place where real experts like George, Leonard,
Aandi, Max, Bryan, Duff, Jason, Roberto, Steve, (forgive me the forgotten ones)
and others, share with us knowledge, patience, and from time to time, secrets.
Thanks to all. You did so much...!

I wish you (and all the list) have a wonderful start for 2001 (and better
revenues for the year.. ;)

Carlos.

Use Distiller the same way you used PDF Writer. Besides, Pdf Writer prompts you
for the filename, no?
Distiller won't.

	No, sorry, the reality is that Distiller is a "one trick 
pony".  It converts Postscript to PDF (and all the things that that 
entails like image downsampling, font management, etc.).

	Then you're Acrobat installation is messed up and I suggest 
you reinstall.  Acrobat (on Windows only!) supports a feature called 
"Open All" that lets you drop certain types of files (text, images, 
MSOffice, etc.) into it and it will then "do what it can" to convert 
them to PDF.   This features is even noted in the Read Me document 
for Acrobat 4 (it didn't make the manual).

I have to write to Distiller as I'm using ME fonts.
I need to know where to set programmatically the pdf file name before the
report is written, so that Adobe won't ask for 'Save as' name. I know how to
do it for PDFWriter - via the registry.

Thank you.

To do this you do NOT rely on the Distiller printer's
automatic creation of PDF. This is not an automatable process.

Instead you do a two stage process.

1. Use the Distiller printer driver, but make it print
to a file instead of the PDF Port. This is nothing to do
with Acrobat - you use the Windows API or your application
environment to print to file.

2. Run Distiller yourself, by command line or OLE (according
to your preference) to make it read the PostScript file
you created, and save it to the location of your choice.

Thank you very much for the quick response.
I guess, the second part with OLE will be fine, I found the method. However,
I still need some more help - it might be trivial, but what is the easiest
way to pre-set the 'print to file' value? Where to look for it?

Thanks.
