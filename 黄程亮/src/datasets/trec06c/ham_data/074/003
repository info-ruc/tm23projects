   I was conversing with one the game developers about TFT displays and he 
didn't recommend them (for gaming) as they had 50ms of so persistency.  So 
if people are using them and they care about display durations to with 50ms 
periods they might just want to get some sensitive test equipment and bench 
their setup.
