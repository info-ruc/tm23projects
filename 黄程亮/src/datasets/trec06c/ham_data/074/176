I am trying to get my machine to run at the fastest refresh rate that I can 
by altering the number of scan lines. I am running in 640x480, 8 bit colour 
mode. When I use <VideoMode 640,400,480,8,0> it seems to work fine. 
However, if I change the second value to anything but 400, I get the message:

SetDisplayMode failed DDERR_INVALID MODE (88760078)
Direct Draw does not support the requested mode.

This seems odd, because Timedx will happily let me tune vertical retraces 
for any number of lines I like (and shows very satisfying reductions in 
refresh times).
Can anyone suggest anything?


 >If you have stored values in the registry for all possible modes you wish 
to exploit you must be transposing the unaltered number of scan lines in 
the video mode specification with the modified number of scan lines.


I don't think that this is correct. The code I used first was:

n1 f60 <DefaultWritingColor 255255255> s6 <id "pio12"> <BackgroundColor 
000000000> <VideoMode 640,380,480,8,0>
$
0 "Press the footswitch";
$
+1 *"Test"/;
$
0 "End";
$

This gives the following error message:

SetDisplayMode failed DDERR_INVALID MODE (88760078)
Direct Draw does not support the requested mode.


Then I used this code:

n1 f60 <DefaultWritingColor 255255255> s6 <id "pio12"> <BackgroundColor 
000000000> <VideoMode 640,480,380,8,0>
$
0 "Press the footswitch";
$
+1 *"Test"/;
$
0 "End";
$

This resulted in DMDX complaining that I had not tuned the relevant 
vertical retrace values in Timedx, when in fact I had (I had selected 
640x480, 8 bit, and entered 380 in the scan lines box).

Note that the only difference between these two bits of code is the 
VideoMode command, the first being <VideoMode 640,380,480,8,0>, and the 
second being <VideoMode 640,480,380,8,0>. I think this addresses your point 
regarding the transposition of unaltered and modified number of scan lines. 
It seems that the first format is actually the correct one, because as I 
pointed out in my first message, <VideoMode 640,400,480,8,0> does actually 
work. However, if I use any value other than 400 in the second position, it 
does not work, and produces the "SetDisplayMode failed" message.

I have also tried to run these bits of code on 4 different machines, with 
identical results on all of them.
