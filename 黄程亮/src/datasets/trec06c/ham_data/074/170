   Yes.  Always had 3 decimal places there.

   No, it has real meaning, that's how long DMDX timed the RT for.  DMDX 
has a _micro_second accurate timer so it can provide times to three decimal 
places, when I've measured standard deviations for RTs as low as 0.29ms 
it's reasonable to assume that sub millisecond RTs are going to be useful, 
not only that but on later hardware that those SDs will drop even further.

>Is ther a way to cut RTs to ms only (no decimal)

   Not yet, but people keep whining about it so I'll stick an option in to 
suppress it.

Dimensions will always be expressed in the least usable term.
Velocity, for example, will be expressed in furlongs per fortnight.
