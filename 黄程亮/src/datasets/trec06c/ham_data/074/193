Jon,

I don't know of any keyword that would save the data automatically, but it
may be worth checking the website for (If you haven't already).  Also, I
think you probably lost the data.  However, it is possible that the data
were saved as a temporary file by some name other than .zil.  See if any
strange files with the appropriate date and time were saved in the file
containing the program.
