   Depends what you mean by "fire", active low, active high, 
what?  Typically we use active low signals but a lot of other devices 
expect positive polarity too. The O switch outputs a word to the output 
ports, to set bit 0 low (all others high) you would use <ox fe> (<ox> uses 
hexadecimal words instead of decimal which is easier for me to handle when 
negative logic is being used, esp. when my calculator is at work), bit 1 
low would be <ox fd>, (fb, f7, ef, df, bf 7f for the rest of the series), 
bit 0 high (all others low) o1, bit 1 high o2 (4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 for 
the rest of the series.
