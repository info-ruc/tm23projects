I have been getting this error message: RTF word </up> used in quotes, not
supprted.

I have three programs that I am working with, two are giving me the message
and one is running fine.  here are the two not working:

<ep> F833 d5 <ContinuousRun> <RecordClockOnTime> <nfb> <zil> <AzkiiResponses>
<id "keyboard"> <id PIO12> <dfs 64> <wc 000255000> <bgc 000000000> <eop>

and

<ep> F839 d5 <ContinuousRun> <RecordClockOnTime> <nfb> <zil> <AzkiiResponses>
<id "keyboard"> <dfs 64> <wc 000255000> <bgc 000000000> <eop>

this is the one that is working:

<ep> F839 d5 <ContinuousRun> <RecordClockOnTime> <nfb> <zil> <AzkiiResponses>
<id "keyboard"> <dfs 64> <wc 000255000> <bgc 000000000> <eop>

I have tried saving it in wordpad which has solved these type of errors
in the past but does not seems to be working now. And taking the PIO12 out
of the first programs parameter line doesn't help either.

In Desparate Need of Help,

Sanity is the playground for the unimaginative.
