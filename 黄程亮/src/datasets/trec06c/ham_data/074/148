   No, specifying the defaults doesn't stop you overriding them.  The 
default keywords <dbc> and <dwc> are there to override the color of your 
rtf file, <bc> and <wc> (if used in a frame) are there to override whatever 
the default color for a frame is, whatever that happens to be, whether it 
came from a <dbc> or <dwc> or whether it came from the color of text in the 
rtf file.  If there's any confusion it's probably comes from <wc> and <bc> 
being synonyms for the defaults if used in the parameter line, this comes 
from ancient DMTG usage and is unavoidable.

Dimensions will always be expressed in the least usable term.
Velocity, for example, will be expressed in furlongs per fortnight.
