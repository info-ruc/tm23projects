   Sure, find yourself a registry modifier and delete the subkeys of 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\DMDX\2\LastUsedItemFile, you'll want to leave 
the default value of the key alone.  If you are open to bartering I can 
write such a utility for you.  If you only want to do it once you can do it 
by hand easily enough with REGEDIT.EXE in your WINDOWS directory.
