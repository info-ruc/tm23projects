   For a DMDX test of QueryPerformanceCounter and item file like the 
following will do the job:

<ep> f30 <id mouse> <mr +button 1> <id keyboard>
<VideoMode 1024 768 768 16 0> <eop>
0 <ln -1> "Display Test Mode 3";
5  "Test Mode 3" / <testmode 3>;
0 "end" l;

   Because the test is continuously updating the display there will be a 
lot of traffic on the bus to produce the error, although the chipset error 
may require PCI traffic to manifest, if so (assuming you don't have a PCI 
video card in which case this test should suffice) a looping item file 
playing audio may be better.  If you are watching the display my guess is 
that the error is going to manifest as a 4700ms latency but you won't see 
DMDX pause for 4.7 seconds as would be the case if the error were 
genuine.  Of course, any latency that long is almost guaranteed to be the 
failure of the chipset.
