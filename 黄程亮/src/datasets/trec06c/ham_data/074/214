Hi John

Thanks for the advice.  My next question is how to set up TimeDX (or
DMDX for that matter, although I haven't gotten that far) with a
keyboard?  I want two choices available to respondents, such as
"favorable" and "unfavorable", represented by two keys.  Do I still need
to run the PIO test in TimeDX?  The "tutorial" listed on the website, as
well as most DMDX documentation I've come across so far, assumes use of
a PIO card and special IO input device.

Thanks again
