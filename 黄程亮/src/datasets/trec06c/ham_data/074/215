Mike,

I don't think you need to "set up" TimeDX to run with a keyboard
or mouse.  It should detect and use those automatically. 
However, you can test the keyboard or mouse in TimeDX by running
the "Input Test" under the Basic Tests menu.  You can then choose
to test the keyboard or the mouse.  If everything is working
properly then pushing "key" will cause "key" to be highlighted.  

Once you are writing DMDX scripts you should use the <id
"keyboard"> or <id "mouse"> keywords enable responses from the
keyboard or mouse.  As John mentioned though, you will not get
very accurate response times with the keyboard or mouse.
