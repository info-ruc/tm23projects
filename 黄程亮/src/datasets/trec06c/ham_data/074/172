I am trying to get my machine to run at the fastest refresh rate that I can 
by altering the number of scan lines. I am running in 640x480, 8 bit colour 
mode. When I use <VideoMode 640,400,480,8,0> it seems to work fine. 
However, if I change the second value to anything but 400, I get the message:

SetDisplayMode failed DDERR_INVALID MODE (88760078)
Direct Draw does not support the requested mode.

This seems odd, because Timedx will happily let me tune vertical retraces 
for any number of lines I like (and shows very satisfying reductions in 
refresh times).

Can anyone suggest anything?
