   17ms is a ___huge___ latency, and anything with that much latency is 
more than likely to have a variability to match.  That Sound Blaster 128 
must suck righteously, I'm pretty sure I've read plenty of disparaging 
remarks about them on the developers lists too (something to do with the 
complete data for a given waveform having to be transferred over the PCI 
bus to their on board memory before it can be played screwing things 
up).  Latency of the Turtle Beach Montego A3DXstream is around 1.5ms, I'd 
say anything with the Aureal chips in them will perform in the same 
fashion.  Faster CPU doesn't hurt either as the faster windows is doing the 
things that preempt DMDX the less variability DMDX exhibits when doing 
things like outputting data to the PIO at a certain time.  Pretty sure one 
of the people in Britain, Mike Ford maybe, had another sound card with 
hardware buffers on it and a nice low latency (and therefore low 
variability is likely) too, don't recall what card it was, he'll have to 
chip in here.
