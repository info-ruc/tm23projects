We have a Soundblaster PCI card... less than a year old... I think a
Soundblaster 128.  Still have some variance even with the change in the
thread priority.  The latency I am measuring is between the output of the
PIO-12 and the output of the sound card.  We did this with an Oscilloscope,
but then I did it again by building a voltage divider and placing it
between my sound output and the input on the headbox of my Neuroscan
synamps (i.e. to down-step the voltage into the mvolt range, so that the
Synamps can handle it... not with a subject hooked up, mind you).  

I conducted a couple of tests:  the sound latency test in TimeDX, and
another test where I put together a simple item file with triggers and
sounds.  I then rectified and averaged the sound file output over 30
trials, and took the mean onset latency, defined as the time from the
trigger to the half amplitude of the sound signal.  I have a jitter range
of about +/- 3 msec.  This doesn't appear to affect our pilot ERP
recordings, nor our pilot startle recordings... but I would like to
decrease this if at all possible.  If I can't decrease it by purchasing
commercial hardware (a sound card), I may build a buffered "AND" gate, i.e.
that will store the 8 bit word from the CIO/DIO 24 and write it out
simultaneously with, or at least within nanoseconds of the measured sound
pulse (measured from the output of the sound card).

Do you have recommendations for fast, buffered sound cards?  I've solved
the latency problem"  It seems that measuring the latency, and then
replacing the default "observed latency" value with the measured value
(around 17 msec) in TimeDX took care of this.  The slop range is still
around +/- 3 msec.... This would be acceptable in a pinch, but i'd still
like to decrease it if I can, even if it means purchasing a better sound card.

thanks,

John
