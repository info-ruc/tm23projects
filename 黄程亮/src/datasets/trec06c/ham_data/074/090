   'Set' as in you are specifically subtracting lines from a display mode?

   Your frame interval must not be 15ms.  The following item file runs for 
3s from second request to the time the "end" is displayed on my testbed 
that has a refresh interval of 16.667ms:

d100 <cr> f30 <id mouse> <mr +button 1> <vm 1024,768,768,16,0>
0 "test the bmp timing stuff";
0 d10 g "river";
255 d30 g "marsglob";
255 d30 g "river";
255 d30 g "marsglob";
255 d30 g "river";
255 d30 g "marsglob";
255 d30 g "river";
0 d30 "end" l;

   Look in the help file under the <Set> keyword.  Basically looking at 
anything to do with counters has a link to the explanations.
