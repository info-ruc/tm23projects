   You want W4 to go to ground, but you also want "pullup" resistors on W1, 
W2, and W3.  These pullups are typically 1Kohm, one end goes to the switch 
and the other goes to +5V.  That way when the switch is not closed (the 
"normal" state for NO switches as opposed to NC, normally closed switches) 
the voltage at the input is +5V, a logic 1, inactive as we use negative 
logic.  When the switch closes the switch sinks all of the current and the 
input voltage is 0V, logic 0 and active to DMDX.
