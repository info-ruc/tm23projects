After trying everything that made sense (e.g. interrupt changes so the 
sound card doesn't share IRQ with other PCI devices, CD cable), I stumbled 
onto a possible solution.  The card stops popping if you disable the 3D 
stuff on the driver (the card ships with this ability).   I am not sure 
whether or not this will affect timings... I'll test this possibility 
Wednesday.
