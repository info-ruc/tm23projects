The problem we have is between the latency of the sound and the latency of
the PIO-12 output.  I will double check this, but believe that the sound
card is a recent creative labs PCI card.  I am also going to go back
through the system and make sure there isn't any big stupid code running
that I am unaware of.

again, thanks!
