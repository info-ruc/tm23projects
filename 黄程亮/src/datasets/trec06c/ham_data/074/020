I am trying to run a program using the 1.3 version.  My goal is to have
the frames displayed for different amounts of time.

<ep> F359 d5  t24000 <ContinuousRun> <RecordClockOnTime> <nfb> <zil> <AzkiiResponses>
<id "keyboard"> <dfs 64> <bgc 000000000> <eop> 

+100   %719 <t 14000> * "REST"/;    For 14 seconds displayed for 14secs
+165 %119 <t 2000> * "REMEMBER"/;   For 2 seconds displayed for 24 sec
+101  %599 <t 24000>  * <line -1> "Orientation", <line 1> "fMRI experience"/;

For 24 sec displayed for 24 sec


When I run the program it seems to only follow the parameter line. I have
had success with this working in the past but I am having problems with
it now. I have gone in and changed a few things but don't remember what
they were and all combos I can think of haven't been successful. I would
appreciate any suggestions.
