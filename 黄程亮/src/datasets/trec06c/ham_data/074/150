   Could be a bug, specifying the color in the frame is not a widely used 
feature given that the color can be specified by the color of the text in 
the .RTF file.  You might try using <safemode 1> when you get hangs, it 
increases the frequency that DMDX checks for the escape key.  Normally it 
won't do this as the display is active to lessen the frequency of display 
errors, however if the display stops for some reason DMDX won't be checking 
for escape ever...
