I have a relatively simple question.  Is a PIO card and separate IO
input device necessary for running DMDX?  It it possible to simply use a
keyboard for the inputs?  I've been unable to run the basic TimeDX
tests, I suspect because I do not have a PIO card or a separate input
device.  Any advice would be helpful.
