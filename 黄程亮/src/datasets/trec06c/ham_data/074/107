   D is a delay parameter, it *delays* the display of the frame.  The 
reason we use it is to determine the duration of the *previous* item's last 
frame so we can be loading the next frame's bitmap(s) as the previous is 
displaying.  If you don't want an initial delay and you can guarantee that 
the bitmap for the display has been loaded already by using it in the 
previous item you can have an initial item with a much lower delay (it will 
still have to be something > 0, the preparation B time still has to be 
allowed for) and only loop 9 times:

0 <ln 0> "Loop Timing Test" / %0! g "cross";
1 d5 g "cross";
250 <set 1,9>
11 d393 g "cross" <dec 1> <bicGT 1,0,-11>;
0 d393 "Test Done";

   Note that the last instruction has to be delayed too to allow the last 
frame to be displayed for the correct duration.

   Don't use 0 as a branch destination, -0 is in fact 0 which is not less 
than 0 so the code can't branch backwards to an item number 0.

Dimensions will always be expressed in the least usable term.
Velocity, for example, will be expressed in furlongs per fortnight.
