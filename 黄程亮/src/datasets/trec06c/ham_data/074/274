   Try reading the docs, whole bunch of stuff in there, you probably want 
the Input section ;)

I have benched a number of input devices and include the results here 
FYI.  These were gathered by using a photosensor on the screen (the only 
way of triggering my solenoid, at the time -- I could have used a PIO line 
if the hardware was built that way) firing a hefty 12V solenoid.  The Min 
and Max values are the respective response times, the Min value is as high 
as it is because it takes some time to get the solenoid moving and then 
some time for it to push the key it's full travel distance.

PIO12 microswtich       18-20ms This sets the baseline as it has the 
minimum travel.
PIO12 KB switch 31-33ms Longer values are due to 6mm of extra travel.
Generic Joystick        28-31ms Polled every three ms, this small error 
range shows the generic joysticks and gamepads are good input devices.
MS Serial Mouse 44-50ms Without the ball.
MS Serial Mouse 46-52ms With the ball.
Old AT Keyboard 40-47ms
OmniKey 102 KB  33-40ms
Cheap Win95 KB  33-69ms A real surprise, shows that all KBs really have to 
be tested with a solenoid before use as an RT gathering device.



   And again a bit later:
