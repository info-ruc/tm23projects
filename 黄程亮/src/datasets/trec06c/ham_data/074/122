   I've improved the listserve threader substantially as you can now see 
some of the lost subject headers and it's assembling of threads has gotten 
better.  However it's still a work in progress as it doesn't categorize by 
month yet, maybe next week.
   Just had some entertaining multimon weirdness with the 2.3.00 version of 
DMDX on Ken's experimental machines upstairs, when you run the job the 
experimenter's screen goes white and stays white till you hit escape at 
which point it comes back to normal -- it's also possible that the first 
screen of the subjects display is white as well although I wasn't able to 
reproduce this.  The setup is still usable (for instance after hitting 
escape and answering no to the abort request it's fine) but inconvenient to 
say the least.  The problem stems from those machines not extending the 
windows desktop onto the subjects display.  In previous versions of DMDX it 
was required that the desktop *not* be extended onto the subjects display 
for DMDX to run correctly, with the redesign of all things multimon it is 
now necessary to extend the windows desktop display onto the subjects 
display, if you don't we now know what happens, white experimenter's 
screens when running jobs...
