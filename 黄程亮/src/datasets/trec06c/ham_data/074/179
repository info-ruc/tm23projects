   Hmm, don't think you can as the error rate counters get reset on any 
test so you can't perform two tests.  I think you'll have to settle for 
<biergt 40>.  Why would you want to separate someone with 70% errors from 
someone that was just responding randomly?  Only way I can think of doing 
it would be to add a keyword that stores the error rate to a counter and 
that way you could perform two tests against the counter, say in a subroutine.

Dimensions will always be expressed in the least usable term.
Velocity, for example, will be expressed in furlongs per fortnight.
