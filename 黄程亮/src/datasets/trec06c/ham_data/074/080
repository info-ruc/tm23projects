Dear all,

We connected a dual channel oscilloscope to the sound card and PIO/12 to
run TimeDX's sound latency test, and are getting a range of approximately 6
msec of slop between the onset of a trigger and the offset of the sound.
Is this comparable to what others are getting, and is there any way to fix
this (barring building an "and" gate and a sound trigger)?  Do other ERP
and startle researchers accept a rang eof 6 msec of slop as acceptable?

thanks,

John
