Greetings again

I'm told that the keyboard input is not as accurate as using a PIO card
and separate input device.  Can anyone give me a read on *how*
inaccurate it is?  If it's off my 1/1000th of a second then that may not
concern us as much as if it were a 1/2 second off, or even 1/100th of a
second off.  

Thanks for any advice.
