Greetings!

I'm trying to run a sample script from the website tutorial, and I'm
getting the following error when I click on "Run":

Could not find Registry Key <Software\TimeDX\2\0 Primary Display
Driver\640x480(480)_8bpp_0Hz>
A request has been made to use the 640x480(640x480) 8 bits per pixel 0
Hz video mode.
You need to use TimeDX2's Advanced/Time Video Mode option and tune some
values for anticipating the Vertical Retrace.

I went into TimeDX2's Time Video Mode area, and ran the test, then
clicked on the "save values in registry" (or something like that)
button.  I went back to DMDX to run the same script but I still got the
same error message.  Any advice on what I can try next?

Thanks again
