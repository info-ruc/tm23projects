As Jonathan suggested, the Turtle Beach Montego A3DXStream (less than 
$30.00 direct from Voyetra Turtal Beach  http://www.turtlebeach.com   ) has 
solved all of our latency jitter woes.  I get an impressive <1 msec 
variability, measuring the latency between the PIO-12 trigger and the sound 
pulse to the Neuroscan unit.  Definitely within acceptable parameters for 
our purposes.  Since we are now also able to compensate for the latency by 
entering the observed latency value into TimeDX, (looks to be approx. 4 
msec between the CIO/DIO 24 trigger and the half-amplitude rise-time of a 
760 Hz tone... haven't tried DigitalVox latency test), we're now solidly in 
the auditory ERP and startle probe business!

My students and I are extremely impressed with how well DMDX is managing 
our experimental task needs, and are especially impressed with the ease 
with which these tasks can be programmed.  I believe that all of us who use 
this software owe a great debt of gratitude to Jonathan and Ken Forster, as 
well as the other faculty and students at the University of Arizona who 
continue to make the development and support of this remarkable software 
possible.  In some of the threads that I see on this listserv, I think that 
some lose sight of the fact that we are privileged to use this software, 
free of charge.  Jonathan does yeoman's work in responding to our queries 
and problems with the software, and the speed of his responsive software 
updates rivals anything that I have seen with any software programmer and 
developer at any price (just try to get this kind of turnaround time and 
useful information from Microsoft).

The alternative would be to pay a lot of money for software that "sucks 
righteously," both in terms of functionality and support.  But, the onus 
for support should not fall solely on Jonathan's shoulders.  I encourage 
all of us to volunteer help and support to our colleagues when we have some 
insight into a question at hand.  It doesn't take that long.

best regards,

John Kline
