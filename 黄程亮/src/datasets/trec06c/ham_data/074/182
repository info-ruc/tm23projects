   Looks like I've completed the last of the modifications to the listserv 
archive that I'm going to make, it should be good to go for a decade or 
so.  It now buffers the locations of months so it's significantly faster 
unless a new post has been made in which case it will be rebuffering 
everything (currently about 3 seconds of processing) but that should be a 
rare enough event that it shouldn't be irritating people.  Of course, 
searching speed will not change, that's just a sequential chug through the 
archive.
