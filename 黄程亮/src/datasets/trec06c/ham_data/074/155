I was looking at the schematic in the TimeDX help file on how to
set up a PIO12 input.  I would like to set up a 3 button mouse so
that Button-1 is Neg-response, Button 2 is Pos-repsonse and
Button-3 is VOX.  Coming out of the mouse I have 4 wires
(W1,W2,W3,W4). W1-W3 is for each button.  When a button1 is
pushed it closes a circuit between W1 and W4.  Likewise for
button 2 and 3.  As I understand the schematic, I want W1 to
connect W1 to pin 36 (neg-response) W2 to pin 35 (pos-response)
and W3 to pin 33 (VOX).  Where do I connect W4?  I think it
should be pin 18 (+5v), but in the schematic it looks like you
have a connection to pin 19 (ground) which I don't understand.

thanks,
Josh
