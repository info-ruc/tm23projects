Subject: 20 X 4 L.C.D Screen?

I put in an e-mail yesterday about using a different L.C.D, I made a 
mistake and said it was a 20 X 8 I meant a 20 X 4.  I thought that 
there was a way to use a 20 X8 L.C.D instead of a standard 16 X 2.

My question is is this possible, I thought I already heard about 
someone on the list that used a 20 X 8.

Please help.
Thank you in advance.
