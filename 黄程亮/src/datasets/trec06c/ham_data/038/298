Subject: musical puzzle and cartoon kit

here's a recap of my two ideas.  anyone wanting to join in is welcome...

Musical Puzzle
the first version is already finished.  what i would like to do is add some
more functionality to it.  perhaps put some LED's in the note landscape so
that as each note plays the landscape lights up (a la "close
encounters...").  there are numerous other things that can be done to make
this into a really great toy.  i think the premise is simple and good, it
just needs some refinement.

Cartoon Kit
create a storyboard with magnetic characters, scenes, behaviors, music
score, and  narration all done by the kids.  have the combined storyboard
cue up video that portrays the "finished product".  allow for
collaboratively creating and editing of stories.
