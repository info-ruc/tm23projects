After reading some of the discussions about wireless communications, I
remembered an article from Nuts and Volts ( http://www.nutsvolts.com ) May
1998. The title of the article is "Naked Data", Explore the power of
wireless data communications using inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware. The
article was written by Ryan Sheldon (http://members.aol.com/ncdcat). The
article discusses using RF and IR as a 1200bps serial data link. The
article shows schematics for some of the IR devices. The RF devices used
are from MING (http://www.ming-micro.com/). Digi-Key carries their
products, and the cost for a transmitter and receiver total less that
25.00. I have not tried the products but it seems like a good place to
start experimenting. I know 1200Bps is not very fast, but some users might
find that data rate acceptable. Also, this would be a one-way link.
