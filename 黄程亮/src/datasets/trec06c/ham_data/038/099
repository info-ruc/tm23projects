Thanks Barry, great work.

I do have one little question:
As I read the data sheet of the GP2D02 (
http://www.sharpsma.com/products/opto/pdf/gp2d02.pdf )
I saw some timing specifications that i think are not taken care of in your
software. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
The timing chart shows the reading of the data with a pulse length of 0.2ms or
less, but the whole reading sequence needs to bee longer than 1ms. Therefor the
highpulses and the lowpulses must not be shorter than 67us. As far as I found
out analyzing your software (I counted the cpu cycles of the software part the
reads the 8 bit distance) reading each bit takes about 50us. The highpulse being
not longer than 10us lets the low pulse be around 40us. Both pulsewidth are
shorter than the pulsewidth recommended in Sharps timing chart.
Now either I'm reading the chart wrong or you are lucky :)) to get those sensors
running.
Please tell me who makes the mistake.

I will be writing a driver for 8 sensores. Therefor I'd like to know if all
sensors work with your software.

Thanks a lot for your effort and your help.

Tom
