Hi Barry,
I have a GP2D05 from Acroname Inc., Have wired as per instructions black
for gnd., green for Vin, Yellow for Vout, and red for Vcc.The pin outs are
different than the GP2D02.
Then  installed the diode and connectors for the handyboard .as per
instructions.
Downloaded the software,loaded the software to the hb.(GP2D02_icb and
TS_gp2.c) Handyboard lcd reads
<GP2D02: 0 0>.
Problem is: Where exactly do I plug the digital out from the GP2D05 and the
digital out from the handyboard?
					
					Thanks in advance
					Terry Gathright
