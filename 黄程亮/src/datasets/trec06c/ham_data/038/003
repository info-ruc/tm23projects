Dear Casey Russell,
	   When pcode is disabled, the handy boards stops treating the
data received on the serial port,in the manner the pcode wants it to. The
bytes it receives through the com2 port is then just plain data for it. It
should know what to do to the data. Hence there should be a receiving
program on the hb to accept the data. The function serial_getchar() waits
for the data coming through the serial port. 
	When you ran Hyperterminal, I believe this function was not
called. It must therefore have confused the hb.
	Write a program which disables the pcode, calls serial_getchar()
and then enables the pcode, inorder for observing the working of these
functions. 
							Yours sincerely,
							     Nitin
