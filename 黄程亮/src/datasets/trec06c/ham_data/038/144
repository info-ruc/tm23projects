Hi,

I finally had some time to connect the lcd to my Handy Board. I have a very
bad solder iron here, and no multimeter, but I believe all the connections
are ok.

When I turn on the board with the boot already downloaded the lcd shows
something like Interactive C, but it appears scrolling. When I send a
printf("text"); it shows TEXT scrolling.

Please help me, I don't know what to do!

Thank you very much,
Cesar
