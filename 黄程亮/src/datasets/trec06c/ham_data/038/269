Hello Everyone!


I have a problem with my Handyboard.
Until last week everything was ok, but now..

At the moment I can put the Handyboard in bootstrap mode,and download 
pcode.
But I do not get the Interactive C message and the beep!

So I guess is a power problem , or a memory problem.
I swap the chips with an other handyboard and they are fine, also the 
voltage regualtor and monitor, seems to be fine.
I do not know how to tes the memory circuitry.

So please let me know if you have any ideas


best regards 

Carlos
