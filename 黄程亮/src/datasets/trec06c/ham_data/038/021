I'm glad you mentioned the Nuts & Volts article, "Naked Data"!  I've used
the MING microdevices RF transmitter and receiver units with success!
The 1200 bps isn't fast but great for small projects such as mobile
robots. I used the MING RF units with the botboard and was able to get a
range of about 75' without an antenna!  I haven't interfaced the RF units
with the Handy Board yet, but plan to soon for a robot project involving
multiple agents in a few weeks.  I'm working on some form of social
behavior and control between multiple robots.   I'll post my results if
anyone is interested.  Also, I have pictures of my robot projects using
the MING RF units on my website at  http://www.mech.utah.edu/~kleang

BTW the Digikey part numbers are: TX-99V3-ND and RX-99V3-ND and at about
$20 per set, you can go wrong!
