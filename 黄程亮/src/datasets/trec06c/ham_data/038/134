Hi Edward,

I am running ic on linux since December. I downloaded the _SOURCE_
from the same location as you I think, 
(ic-src-unix-2.860-beta.tar.Z)
and build the binaries on my system to make sure they will use the
libraries I have.
You also have to download pcode-2.81-dist.tar.Z since it contains
the .s19 file.
If you like to write .asm code too, I think you have to change
as11_ic. (At least I had to)

Good luck with linux.
Ciao Thomas.
