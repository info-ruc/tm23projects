Hi,

I have the following questions:

I want to transmit data by a radio comunication beetween HB and PC 
(only HB to PC right know) using the pa7 and a one-way wireless link
from
Conrad Electronics (german electronic reseller).

Do i need the pa7_9600 (modified to 2400) or the pa7i9600 (also
modified) ?

Does someone know if there is a source code (.asm) file of the pa7i9600
?
If it exists, where can i download it ?
Or can someone mail it to me ?



Thank you very much,

Simon
