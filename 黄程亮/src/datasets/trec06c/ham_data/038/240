Actually the DS1225Y is a 8Kx8 NVRAM chip. The correct Dallas part for the
HB is a DS1230. Another option is the Simtek EEPROM backed (no battery)
chips. They have the same package as a standard RAM chip, whereas the
higher profile Dallas modules stick up into the LCD or the expansion board
on the HB. Check:

The STK15C88 looks like the ticket, although I've had a couple of these on
order for three weeks now here in Canada. Maybe you'll have better luck...

Cheers, Duncan
