Hi,

I can only speak for the GP2D02:
voltage requirement 5 volts very low power
range 10cm to 80cm
beam width at maximum range is about 1cm
1 input bit and 1 output bit required
Cheaper,smaller ,less power, and easier to hook up than sonar

I see it as a better alternative to sonar if you are doing wall following,
not as good because of the very narrow beam if you are doing obstacle
avoidance.

Hello all:

I have to ask this question: I am using a Rug Warrior Pro board and
handyboard. Could the Sharp GP2d02 or the Hamatmtsu P5507 be used on the
Rug Warrior as well. 

More specifically :

What are the voltage requirements of these two?
What are their ranges?
How narrow is the beam?
How many I/O ports does each require?
Why would I choose one of these over sonar ranging?

Any help concerning these questions will be deeply appreciated.
