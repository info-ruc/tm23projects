Hello All,

Due to requests, from the HandyBoard list and from students in my 
Microprocessor subject, I have updated the Editor / Compiler / 
Download (HandyBD.EXE) on my site.

http://132.234.46.5/Programs

(Note: I have not yet updated the Buffalo Monitor routines)

The new program has the following improvements:

1.  It is now 32Bit code (Win95, 98, NT code, (Win3 not supported)

2.  The Editor no longer has the 32k limit on Text file sizes.
     Limited only by memory.

3.  The external Assembler Program can be user selected.

4.  The Terminal program now includes the ability to download the 
     initial Buffalo monitor.
     (That is; Perform the function of DL.EXE or HBDL.EXE)
     Code thanks to: Vadim Gerasimov of the MIT Media Laboratory

5.  Tool bars and Speed buttons have been included.

6.  Bug fixes.
