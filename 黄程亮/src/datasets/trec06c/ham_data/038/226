I have seen questions on the list about using a 20 X 8 instead of a 
16 X 4 lcd, I think that the person was told to look on the handy 
board site for a 20 X 8 driver.

has anybody used a 20 X8 lcd and if so how did you do it and could 
you help me use one on mine. I prefer a bigger screen and I can get 
them real cheap.

any help would be appreciated.

Thank you in advance.
