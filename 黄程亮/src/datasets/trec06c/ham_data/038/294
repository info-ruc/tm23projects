I am new to the robotics field but can certainly share with you what I am
doing.  I first read the book, Mobile Robots:  Inspiration to
Implementation by Joseph L. Jones, et al.  The book contains a good
overview of the various components in building a mobile robot and walks
you through how to build a fairly complete robot.

I then subscribed to this mailing list to get some idea of what projects
people are doing and what are some of the problems they are facing.  I am
currently building my Handy Board.  Once it is completed, I will be
building the rest of my robot using the advice from Jones' book.

The Handy Board web site
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/index.html
contains a wealth of information about the Handy Board, including where to
purchase one.  This site is "required surfing" for anyone using the Handy
Board.

I would be interested in other "beginner" web references or book
recommendations that list members may have.

Good Luck,
John
