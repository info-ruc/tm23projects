During the last few days I have received more then 40 offers to buy my 3
used HBs.

I am almost done selling the HBs according to the criteria of geographical
convenience.

I am sorry for all the other people that answer to my letter.

I am receiving several answers. Tonight I plan to take some digital pictures
of what I have and answer to the e-mails that I have received.
I am located in Metro Detroit , Mi, USA. 
I would like to charge 150 US $ per HB + shipping (should be between 5 or 10
US $ with UPS).

I have 3 Gleason Research Handyboard for PC (GRHB-PC) that I would like
 to sell for half price or less. Mint conditions , I still have all the
 boxes. I have finished my project succesfully.
 
 Does anybody have a suggestion where to sell used handyboards? 
 Should I
 try Ebay.com?
