Subject: Two servos, one input ?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Has anyone hooked two servo motors up to one input? I have a project
that requires three servos, but two are an identical pulse. I was going
to hook those two up as servo_a7 and run a 1000-1200mA current at 6
volts. I'm thinking that will give me the oomph to run them both and
hoping I'm getting the math right :-). Has anyone done this or something
similiar?
