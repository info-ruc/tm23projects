Terry,
Understand that the GP2D05 is a different device than the GP2D02.
For the '05' you can set a analog threshold and the digital output read 1 or
0 depending
whether the distance is according to this set threshold.
The '02' device has a real serial output to send a byte.
This means that it has no use to use the code of Barry to drive your '05'.
