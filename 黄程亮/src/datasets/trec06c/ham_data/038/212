Sorry I won't be in class for the discussion of projects on Tuesday. One
suggestion...As you think about project ideas, don't just think of ideas
that could be turned into products in the next year or two. I think it is
important for all of us to be thinking about toys that will truly transform
the ways kids play, create, and learn -- even if they are years away from
commercial viability. (FYI: We created the first prototype of a
"programmable brick" in 1987; the LEGO Mindstorms product hit the market 11
years later, in 1998.)

If you think I can help with any of your toy ideas, don't hesitate to
contact me....
