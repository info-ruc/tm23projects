Subject: Linux, and HB beta binaries: problems getting started


Handy Board list: 

I'm trying to get the handy board running under Linux for a robotics
class at the University of Colorado. All the devel platforms are Macs
but I'd like to use Linux. I'm having problems getting started, even
though I've grepped all the list archives for linux, and read the tech
ref, and faq. 

The handy board says v1.2 on the silkscreen. 

I downloaded the binaries ic-linux-2860-beta-binaries.tar.Z  from:
ftp://cherupakha.media.mit.edu/pub/projects/interactive-c/unix/
and the libraries from:
ic-sparc-sunos-2853.tar.Z   
according to the README_LINUX file and have unpacked and set my paths
to see them, etc. 

I'm running Debian 2.0 which is glibc. I'm starting to think that this
is too new for the handi board's ic, and dl binaries, since all the
beta files are dated 1994. My kernel is 2.0.36. 

when I invoke 
ic or dl
I get
ic: can't find library 'libm.so.4'   

find / -name libm.so* -print returns:
/lib/libm.so.6
/lib/libm.so.5.0.9
/lib/libm.so.5
/usr/lib/libm.so        

...so it seems I don't have the necessary library but have the newer
ones. 

I *can* run the mon binary as root and get good results when I first
put the board in download mode and then run mon. I can test the LCD
and analogs, etc. I therefore know that I have everything connected
ok. I tried to download a .s19 file and seem to have corrupted the
board. I can't find the file
pcode_hb.s19 
in the distribution I've downloaded. 

I could realy use some help or pointers to help since I've looked
through all the docs now. 

I'm willing to upgrade if this is necessary. 

Thanx in advance,
