A Taylor series isn't the way to go: they converge far too slowly.

Here is a polynomial fit to arccos(x):

arccos(x) ~ =  1.5708 - 1.0927 x + 4.358 x^3 - 0.8340 x^5

It differs from the exact value of arccos(x) by no more that 0.08  radians (4.6
degrees) in the range [-1,1].

If you need more accuracy, just fit a polynomial with more terms to arccos.
