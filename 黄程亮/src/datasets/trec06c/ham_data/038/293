For the crystal, Mouser Part No: 520-HCU800-S Description: ECS HC-49/U-S 
MICROPROCESSOR CRYSTAL CRYSTAL 8.0 MHZ Substitution can be made. Make 
sure it is low profile though. Cost is $1.55 at Mouser.

DS1233-10 Allied Part No: 671-0125 but they want a $25.00 minimum 
purchase. Not a $50.00 minimum. I order from them consistently for over 
and under $50.00 and they never charge a minimum handling fee unless 
your order is under $25.00.

Sterling Electronics has them in stock. Go to the Sterling site and 
click on "Contact Us" to find out your local Sterling distributor then 
e-mail them.

Newark Part No: 06F4319 and the cost for this DS1233-10 is $1.42

Good Luck and enjoy
