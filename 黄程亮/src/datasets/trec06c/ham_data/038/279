Hey class,

I will be continuing work on augmented kites and anyone interested in
helping out with the programming and musical mapping would be appreciated on
board.

I am also going to continue to hack a 3D printer from lego.  The plan is to
print in icing sugar and flour though I also hope to expand into ice-cream
and chocolate.  The promise of making arbitrary shapes and structures in
edible materials quite appeals to me.  Any experienced logo programmers
would be a boon to the project.

I particularly like Jason's Jungle Jim (Jungle Jam?) idea of augmenting
large playground equipment and am willing to consult in structural strain
gauges or ropes with sensors for this project.  To my knowledge there hasn't
been any real work on building strain measurement into the body of rope and
there are many applications for such a thing.  It would be a novel
technology to emerge from this project.  A braided composite fibre rope
could conceivably do this.  - smart rope......

I love also the chemistry learning centre of Kelly's.  Finally chemistry
could be made as fascinating as it really is and less daunting by good
physical and tangible learning tools.

The augmented play and acting kit with sensors in clothing and stage
equipment seems to have great potential.  I may be able to offer some
consulting in the textile component of this project.

In general - I am one of the shop managers and if anyone needs consulting on
how to build and realise their toys I can help with the physical
manufacturing aspects.  Casting / molding / machining etc.

cheers,

Saul.
