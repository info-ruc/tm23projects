Hi.Anyone of u knows how to edit an image in GC-Prevue?The problem is that 
I cannot get the accurate negatives of the hb solder side,as there is a
bit of shorting that occurs in the image file created by GC-Prevue for the 
exact resolution,whereas the magnified version doesn't show any shorts in
GC-Prevue.PLEASE HELP!!!Thanx in advance.

cheers,
parag
