There is an article in DDJ on the WOOKIE 68HC11 
emulator in Mar 99... There are files in 
www.msoe.edu/eecs/ce/ceb/resources
including GNUs gcc C compiler with a back end
for 68HC11.. I think that it is targeted for the rug warrior.
You may need to rework the backend..
I don't know if there is a GCC version for the HB and ic
does not seem to support inline asm directives as far as 
I can tell.
