Dear Berg,
	You can perhaps express cos^-1 in the forms of a Taylor series and
use that series for finding the approximate value. I have however not
tried it.
	There is no math function for inverse cosine.Refer to handy board
manual available el.www.mit.media.edu for details on IC.
							Yours sincerely,
							    Nitin
