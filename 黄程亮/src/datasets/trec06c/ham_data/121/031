I agree.  Mechanisms uderlying pattern formation in Wolfram's programs are
'passive' in that programs themesleves are incapable of utilizing free
energy, whereas the patterns formd in bios are active in that their
formation is driven by self-organizing chemical reaction-diffusions
processes occurring in bios themselves.

Also theories are maps; they are not territories.  Theorists can only
construct maps of reality at various levels of granularities (i.e., the
degress of details of description) and not reality itself (which may be
said to have infinitely small granularity).  Theorists can only describe 
mechanisms and write computer programs mapping reality at arbitrarily
chosen levels of granularity, some of which engineers may be able to
instantiate with varying degrees of realism.
