Again, I want to think about the simplest hierarchy first.  To me this
consists of a bifurcation tree shown below which is composed of a set of
three kinds of elements - monovalent, bivalent and trivalent elements. The
root of the tree (i.e., 1 in the figure below) is bivalent, the leaves
(e.g., 16, 17, 18, etc.) are monovalent, and the rest of the tree consists
of trivalent branching points (e.g., 2, 4, 8, etc.).  It may well be that
any hierarchy in 2D-plane can be constructed using these three elements,
which may be viewed as the atoms of 2D-hierarchies.  By extension, we can
easily envision the atoms of 3D-, 4D-, etc. hierarchies, in which case we
may have to inroduce 4-valent and 5-valent elements as well.   For
convenience we may refer to the n-valent element of a tree hierarchy as
the "n-hierarchon" (Sorry, Stan. One too many neologism?) So, in the
following figure, 1 would be a 2-hierarchon; 2, 3, . . . , 16 would be
3-hierarchons; and 16 through 31 would be 1-hierarchons.

Based on this classificaiton of the elements of hierarchies, it becomes
evident that not all the elements of a temporal hierarchy can serve as
'coincidence detectors'. Only the trivalent hierarchons can fullfill the
role of coincidence detectors.

Returning to the simplest 2D hierarchy (i.e., the hierarchy shown below),
I think we can use it to represent two distinct kinds of hierarchies--
spatial and temporal hierarchies, which may turn out to be projections of
a higher-order hierarchy, the 'spatiotemporal' hierarchy.  We may
designate them as the s-hierarchy, the t-hierarchy, and the st-hierarchy.
This in turn would force us to admit of three classes of hierarchons --
s-, t-and st-hierarchons, each having three distinct kinds of elements as
already discussed (in the case of 2D hierachies).  We can denote these
different kinds of hierarchons thus -- s1-, s2-, and s3-hierchons
constituting the
s-hierarchy, t1-, t2- and t3-hierarchons for the t-hierarchy, and st1-,
st2-and st3-hierarchons.

elements referred to herre as "hierarchons". See above for the meaning of
the valency of elements.

Using the terminology introduced above, we may identify your scale
hierarchy as an exampl of the 2D spatial hierarchy, which would include
the hierarchy formed by quarks, nucleons, atoms, molecules, complexes,
etc.

I wonder if we can consider your specification hierarchy as an example of
the spatiotemporal hierarchy defined above.  This identification would be
valid if we can show that the hierarchons involved in specification
hierarchy require both the spatial and the time dimension to be completely
specified.

With all the best.
