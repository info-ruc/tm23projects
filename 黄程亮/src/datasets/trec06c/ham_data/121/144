I second the notion that you MUST check what TimeDX has timed, and if
necessary modify the values to be sensible ones, otherwise a machine
will hang..

//So the same script can work or not work, it just depends on the 
//machine.  For a start turning on <safemode 1> will probably 
//allow you to 
//exit DMDX with greater ease when things are disintegrating.  
//Next up is 
//checking that the refresh rate you've timed in TimeDX is 
//actually a valid 
//refresh rate.  Any number of times we've seen machines with 
//crappy drivers 
//make TimeDX somehow provide 0 ms as the refresh interval of a video 
//mode.  When people don't even remotely check what TimeDX is 
//displaying and 
//go ahead and store those values in the registry DMDX comes 
//along and tries 
//to use those values and performs much the same way as you are seeing 
//it.  The solution is usually to get new video drivers.  If 
//that doesn't fix 
//things sometimes (but not recently) there are switches in the 
//Refresh Rate 
//test in TimeDX that can fix the way TimeDX determines the 
//retrace rate 
//(usually turning off Read Between Flips to Stop Cheating 
//Drivers).  If it 
//is in fact the case that TimeDX is determining that the 
//retrace interval is 
//0 ms and nothing will make TimeDX's automatic determination 
//routines work 
//you can always override them with your own values (there's a bunch of 
//documentation on it in the TimeDX help).
