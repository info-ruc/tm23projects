DIGITAL FOUNTAIN APPROACH

a limitation of the  current mirroring technology is that a user must
choose a single mirror site from which to access the entire data.
performance can be improved substantially if the users are able to
download disjoint data (as far as possible) from multiple mirror sites in
parallel.

erasure codes are utilized for this purpose as this allows an initial file
consisting of k packets to be encoded into n packets such that receiving
any k of them can reconstruct the original file.


CONSTRAINTS:
bandwidth on the back-channel (i.e. client sending response to server) is
extremely limited.thus, approaches based on renegotiation are not good as
they require feedback from the client.


ASSUMPTIONS:
1) set of paths from client to mirror sites are bottleneck disjoint


TORNADO CODES:
they tradeoff a small increase in decoding efficiency for a substantial
decrease in decoding and encoding times.
each server encodes the file using Tornado codes and then randomly
permutes the packets before sending.

This random permutation prevents (to a certain extent) duplicate packets
at the client when it receives from multiple servers.the stretch factor (
n/k) is chosen sufficiently large so that cycling does not occur (i.e.
receiving
duplicate packets from server)

duplicate packet recieval can be prevented by the client negotiating with
each server.

Requirements of an ideal protocol : minimize network traffic , reliable ,
efficient, on-demand , tolerant.

the authors also suggest a layering scheme for multiple multicasts based
on synchronization points.
(the layers are ordered by increasing transmission rate)





NETWORK CODING

this approach allows intermediate nodes to encode packets.
the authors point out that multiple copies of a packet may arrive
repeatedly at the client through

different paths. this is prevent using network encoding.

content propagation : the algorithm to decide which block to transfer is
based only on local information. the possible policies are : random block,
local rarest.



BASIC IDEA :

each node picks a random set of co-efficients for all its blocks. each
element of each block is multiplied with the corresponding co-efficient
and all such results (for all blocks) are added together
in a finite field.

a node can recover the original file after receiving k blocks for which
associated coefficient vectors are linearly independent to each other.


the only time that a block is not useful is when the receiver has all
blocks which were used to combine into the sent block. thus, each node
must know its neighbors coefficients to determine if the block is
"innovative" or not.


incentive mechanisms can be used to prevent free-riding.




BOTH THE SCHEMES DO NOT PREVENT MALICIOUS NODES FROM FORWARDING JUNK
PACKETS AND THUS PROBABLY DESTROYING THE MULTICAST.
detecting whether a node is malicious seems also very difficult.
