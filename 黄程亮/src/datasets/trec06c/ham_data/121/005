We use Docutek; I scrutinize the items and determine whether I feel  
they fall under Fair Use guidelines;  if not, I request a quote from  
CCC or sometimes direct from the publisher if I think I might get a  
better deal on the price.

***we are making extensive use of linking to our online subscription  
content: we never scan if we can link; the only problem is that it is  
fairly time-intensive to determine whether we have online access to  
something that is brought in for scanning:  it would be faster just  
to scan and not check.  Also, I do not feel confident that my Circ  
parapros could handle that, so I've been doing it myself--not a good  
thing!  We use EZProxy, and also warn students in the Docutek entry  
for the item that they will need to secure the current library  
password in order to access the item from off-campus.  Periodically I  
test a random sample of items from home to be sure that they really  
are accessible.  So far, haven't had any complaints other than, "I  
don't know the password--why won't you give it to me?"  The majority  
of the faculty love Docutek once they get over the learning curve.

***our Docutek system is configured so that once a student is logged  
into WebCT, they don't need to enter any other password in order to  
access the Docutek course reserves page for that class (except, as  
noted above, if there are linked documents involved).
