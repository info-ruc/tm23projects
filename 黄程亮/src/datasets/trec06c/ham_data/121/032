        Jokes of the day<br>
        <br>
        </font></font><font color="#CCCCCC">A rich white man threw a party
and 
        invited all of his buddies and neighbors, including Leroy, the only
black 
        guy in the neighborhood. He held the party around the pool in the
backyard 
        of his mansion. Everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing,
eating 
        BBQ and flirting with the women. At the height of the party, the
host 
        said, "I came home from a business trip and I found a 10 foot
alligator 
        got in my pool and I can't find anybody who will come and take him
away. 
        I'd give a million dollars to anyone who would do the job!" The
words 
        were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash and
everyone 
        turned around and saw Leroy in the pool! Leroy was fighting the
gator 
        and kicking its ass! He was jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs,
throwing 
        punches, head butts and chokeholds, biting the gator on the tail
and flipping 
        it through the air like some kind of Kung-Fu master. The water was
churning 
        and splashing in the struggle. Finally Leroy strangled the gator
and let 
        it float to the surface. He slowly climbed out of the pool.
Everybody 
        was staring in disbelief. Finally the host says, "Leroy, I reckon 
        I owe you a million dollars." "I don't want it," said Leroy, 
        panting. The rich man said, "Leroy, I have to give you something! 
        You won the bet." Leroy said, "I would be satisfied if you gave 
        me the name of whichever one of these white motherf**kers it was
that 
        pushed me in the pool." </font></font></td>
