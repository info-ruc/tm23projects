"Beautiful Mind"  reminded me "Rosemary's Baby". In the latter the terrible 
infant was never shown, but its horribleness was conveyed through the 
reaction of other personages. Similarly, in the former the beauty of the 
mind is never show directly, but through people saying "how ingenious!".

In the special features movie director was interviewing Nash and he wrote 
crocodile-long equations on the blackboard to explain Nash Equilibrium. 
Director understood nothing but (or, perhaps, because of that) was amazed at 
Nash's cleverness. Meanwhile Nash Equilibrium is an elementary concept and 
is presented in an undergraduate textbook on microeconomics. Don't know if 
it is useful, but it is interesting (I don't see anything ingenious in it, 
however).
