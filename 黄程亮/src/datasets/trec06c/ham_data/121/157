Dear All,



A brief email today in advance of the Easter break.


  * In response to a large number of requests from Heads of Departments
wanting to know the best ways in which they can support the action, we have
produced some guidance. Many Heads of departments who are AUT members are
being put under pressure to assist management in various ploys aimed at
undermining the action short of a strike.  AUT members are resisting this
pressure. Please forward immediately to the Heads of Department in your
institution: http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/d/h/asos_hodadvice.pdf and, as
the guidance suggests try to organise meetings of HoD's as soon as
possible.



VCs turn heat up on UCEA

The employers' much-vilified decision not to negotiate with the unions came
in for further attack today - from their own side. Vice-Chancellors have
turned on their national representative body, the Universities and Colleges
Employers' Association (Ucea), following frustrations at the Ucea board's
intransigence. AUT general secretary, Sally Hunt, told the Times Higher
Education Supplement that any blame for the dispute still rumbling on
should be placed firmly at the door of the Ucea board - something VCs are
now starting to do. "I am still unclear as to why Ucea refuses to meet with
us, and so it appears are many vice-chancellors," she said. More on this
story and the dispute can be found in this week's THES (out a day early
because of the Easter break).



Keele Setting a trend?

Students at Keele University are apparently being told they don't need to
bother completing their final year to be awarded a full classified degree.
The University's Senate has approved contingency plans that will see
students who have completed just 62.5 per cent of their studies awarded
their class of degree on the marks achieved so far. Sally Hunt, said:
"Universities should not be compromising Britain's standing in the world in
this way and no student should be placed in a position where their degree
is called into question. There is no reason why this dispute cannot be
settled tomorrow. We're ready and willing to talk. Universities would be
better off talking to us to resolve the assessment boycott than trying to
devise half-baked ideas that may make our universities a laughing stock."



AUT general secretary -- live on air Easter Monday:

Sally Hunt will be debating the rights and wrongs of the current pay
dispute with a representative from Ucea on Radio 4's 'You And Yours'
programme at midday on Easter Monday. We are awaiting confirmation that
Ucea will be taking part in the programme, but, if they do, we are keen to
learn why they will debate with us in public but not meet to thrash out a
pay claim. Tune in and maybe find out on 198LW.



And in brief:
  * QAA: AUT and NATFHE are writing to the QAA expressing our serious
concerns relating to the use of drafting in post-grads and retired members
for the marking of exams. NUS has also written a similar letter.    * New
materials: New ASOS materials to arrive at LAs next Thursday -- for a
preview- or to download- go here (those marked new):
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1359    * General meetings: A
number of LAs are currently organising general meetings to bring members
together after Easter in order to re-focus energies on the action. If you
would like a national speaker please contact Justine.stephens@aut.org.uk
* More details in next weeks email of VC/Ucea split and Bradford mistakenly
paying strikers and deducting from those not on strike.
