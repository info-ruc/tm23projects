"DLF Aquifer is an initiative of the Digital Library Federation. Envisioned 
as a means of leveraging digital library content, DLF Aquifer is creating 
scalable solutions to enable teaching, learning and scholarship. Beginning 
with a significant, well-bounded collection of digital content in the area 
of American culture and life, DLF Aquifer is creating a test-bed of tools 
for selecting, collecting and providing access to quality digital content. 
Grounded in the thinking that libraries add value through the organization 
of information, DLF Aquifer offers opportunities for collaboration among 
libraries and with partners building repositories, content management 
systems, course management systems and other solutions that support the 
scholarly process."
