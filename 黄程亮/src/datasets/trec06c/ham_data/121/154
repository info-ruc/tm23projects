Apologies for cross-posting

I=92m glad to announce that the Repository UM team=20
at Minho University has finished the development=20
of a new Add-on to DSpace, that we called=20
=93Request Copy=94 (but others may call =93Request Eprint=94 or =93Email=
 Eprint=94, etc.).

This first version of the Add-on (see description=20
below) is available at:=20
<http://wiki.dspace.org/RequestCopy>http://wiki.dspace.org/RequestCopy .

As we plan to release a new version (including a=20
third option/reply =96 Change Access to Open=20
Access) in the coming weeks, we will welcome=20
comments and suggestions from early adopters or=20
testers. Please send your comments and=20
suggestions to: repositorium@sdum.uminho.pt




What is the DSpace Request Copy Add-on?

It was recently suggested by Stevan Harnad that=20
we develop a "request eprint by email" feature=20
for DSpace, similar to one that has recently been=20
implemented in GNU Eprints for deposits whose=20
full-text access privileges are set to Restricted=20
Access (RA) rather than Open Access (OA), in=20
order to tide over any RA period with facilitated=20
email access. The Request Copy Add-on is this=20
feature developed for DSpace 1.3.2.
The purpose of this feature is to increase both=20
the content deposited in Institutional=20
Repositories (IRs) and its immediate usability by=20
providing a way to accommodate the (frequently=20
unfounded) worries of authors and their=20
institutions about copyright infringement during=20
any publisher embargo periods on public=20
self-archiving, by creating a semi-automated=20
mechanism whereby would-be users can request and=20
authors can email an individual copy of a=20
full-text deposited with access set as RA.

This feature will be very important for advancing=20
OA if universities and other research=20
institutions adopt the Generic Model for an=20
Open-Access Self-Archiving Mandate (=20
http://openaccess.eprints.org/index.php?/archives/71-guid.html).=20
In this model, depositing immediately (upon=20
acceptance for publication) is mandatory whereas=20
setting deposit immediately to OA is merely=20
encourages, leaving the decision up to the author.

This is how the =93Request Copy=94 feature works:

1- In all non-OA items (we consider non-OA all=20
DSpace items/files that have access different=20
from Anonymous) there is a link to a =93Request a=20
Copy to the author=94 Form, activated in the=20
View/Open link and also on the =93Restricted=20
Access/Request-a-copy=94 logo that we added at the side.

2- The requester must enter his/her email address=20
and name, and may add a comment, and press a =93Request-a-copy=94 button.

3 =96 An email is sent to the depositor (either one=20
of the authors, or their designee). The text of=20
the mail is configurable (in our case we made an=20
express statement to forward the mail to the=20
author(s) if the depositor is not author). The email message contains a=
 token.

4 =96 Using that token, the author may reply, by=20
just clicking in one of the two buttons=20
available: =93Send Copy=94, =93Don=92t send copy=94.

5 =96 After choosing the Send/Don=92t send reply, the=20
author is presented with one of the two message=20
models (also configurable and editable) for the=20
reply. Finally, the author must hit the Send=20
button, and the message (including the file(s) if=20
the author chose the Send option) is sent to the requester.
