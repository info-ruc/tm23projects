There is the usual confusion by the anonymity of the

I want to extend this true statement of Stan to the
graph-tabulation further below, where the writer tries
to 'order' nature (whatever) fitting the simplest wayw
of the human mind:

How about:

NUMBERING every (!) in consecutive - or not -figure
with the (...) portions unlimited?
(Which would give a 'multifurcation') 

It would represent the 'hierarchy' - to use Stan's
term or an unlimited network (especially if there is a
recursive possibility among the 'nodes'.
