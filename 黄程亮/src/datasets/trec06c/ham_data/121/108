	The first paper, "SCRIBE: A large-scale and decentralized
application-level multicast infrastructure," presents an
application-level multicast which supports large number of groups.
Scribe is built on top of pastry. Therefore, it leverages pastry's
reliability, self-organization, and locality properties. Scribe
supports 4 simple operations, create, join, leave, and multicast, to
its application. Any node can perform the 4 operations and become root
of multicast, or used to disseminate messages for other group, or node
in the multicast group.
	To create a group, node will route the create message to node
numerically closest to the groupId. Then the node became the root,
rendezvous point for the multicast group. To join a group, node will
route a join message to the rendezvous point, and all the intermediate
nodes will maintain a children table and used to forward messages for
the multicast group. To multicast a message, node send a message to
the rendezvous point and then root disseminate the message through the
multicast tree. Periodically, each non-leave node in the tree sends a
heartbeat message to its children. If the child doesn't receive the
heartbeat, then it will send JOIN to reestablish the multicast group.
In order to provide scalability, Scribe sacrifice performance, such as
bandwidth and latency, of disseminate multicast tree because even the
node outside of the multicast group need to help forward messages for
the group.
	The second paper, "Design and Evaluation of a Wide-Area Event
Notification Service," presents event notification system which
supports publish/scribe operations. This paper attacks a broader class
of problem where a node receives only the notification it scribes to.
In multicast, node can only receive messages which is disseminate in
the group. However, in publish/subscribe system, node will only
receive notifications (messages) it subscribe to. Subscription can be
ranges of values of different attributes in a notification. Then it
presents solution for different architecture, which include
hierarchical client/server architecture, acyclic and general peer to
peer architecture. To route a notification, a notification is routed
as far as possible and replicate only close to the parties of
interested. The filter will be installed as close to the sources of
notification to reduce the traffic. This paper doesn't talk about
fault-tolerance and self organizing of the systems. It only focuses in
the expressiveness and scalability. Without fault- tolerance and
self-organizing property, it is suitable to deploy in wide-area
network.
