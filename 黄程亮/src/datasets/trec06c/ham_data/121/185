In one of my previous posts, I described the hypothesis that all enzymes
can be viewed as coincidence detectors (defined in the legend to Figure 1
below). In this post, this hypothesis is tested against the newly
determined 3D structure of an enzyme known as Dicer which dices out a
precisely measured fragment from a duble-stranded RNA precursor molecule.
Viewing this enzyme as a coincidence detector seems to open the door to
new insights and predictions about the structure and function of this
important enzyme.

About ten years ago, molecular biologists and biochemists discovered a new
class of RNA molecules, variously called microRNAs or small interfering
RNAs, siRNA, only about 20 to 30 nucleotide long (compared with the better
known counterpart, mRNA, with several hundreds or more nucleotide long),
that can silence or interfere with the mechanisms of information transfer
from DNA to RNA to proteins (see [1] a recent review).  The phenomenon of
small RNA-dependent inhibition of information transfer is known as RNA
interference, or RNAi. RNAi is not mediated by microRNAs alone but by a
combination of a microRNA and a system of proteins associated with it,
together forming a molecular complex known as RISC (RNA-Induced Silencing
Complex).  RISC can inhbit genetic informaitoin transfer in one of three
ways – i) by degrading mRNA having sequences recognized by the microRNA
bound to RISC, ii) by inhibiting protein synthesis by binding to
complementary mRNA sequences and thereby preventing the ribosomes from
reading genetic information encoded therein, and iii) by binding to DNA
itself, preventing RNA polymerase to read the genetic messages to produce
mRNA (see Figure 3 in [1]).

The purpose of this post is to focus on the molecular mechanism of action
of the enzyme known as Dicer that produces (i.e., dices out) microRNAs
from longer precursor molecules referred to as pre-microRNAs [1].  The
3-dimensional X-ray structure of the Dicer from an intestinal parasite,
Giardia intesnallis, was recently solved by Ian MacRae and his coworkers
at the University of California, Berkeley [2].  He presented an elegant
lecture on the structure of Dicer on April 10 at the New York Academy of
Science RNAi Discussion Group meeting in New York, which prompted me to
write this post.

The Dicer molecule from Giardia intestinalis is a polypeptide about 1000
amino acid residue long (8,500 x10^3 Dalton molecular weight) and has 
three main domains called PAZ domain, RNase IIIa, and RNase IIIb.  The
X-ray structure of Dicer obtained by MacRae and his associates shows that
the PAZ domain is located on one end of the molecule and the two RNase
domains are located on the other end, forming a double head.  The
center-to-center distance between these two ends is about 25 nucleotides
long.

Although no X-ray structure is yet available of the complex formed between
pre-microRNA and Dicer, MacRae combined the Dicer structure and the known
structure of  a pre-microRNA computationally and speculated on how Dicer
may manage to cut out the precisely 25-nuclotide long microRNA from the
pre-microRNA.  According to MacRae, the PAZ domain bind one end of the
pre-microRNA molecule and RNases IIIa and IIIb bind the other end,
cleaving it (one strand per RNase) to produce an exactly 25-nucleotide
long microRNA.

But the proposed mechanism seems reasonable except that it dose not 
provide any rationale for the interesting observation MacRae made that,
when the PAZ domain was removed, the remaining Dicer molecule cleaved
pre-microRNA molecule indiscriminately, producing multiple fragments with
different lengths. One way to rationalize this observation occurred to me
while I was listening to his lecture:

  1)  The PAZ domain may act as a self-inhibitory component of the Dicer
nuclease activity, most likely by controlling the active site geometry
of RNAses IIIa and b through the intervening alpha helical structure.
  2)  When pre-microRNA duplex binds to Dicer, its 5’end bind to the PAZ
domain and disinhibits the RNase IIIa and IIIb, thus allowing these
nucleases to cleave their bound substrates, namely, the single strands
of pre-microRNA duplex.

   3) Thus, Dicer can be viewed as a coincidence detector in the sense
that it receives two inputs, the binding of the pre-microRNA to the
RAase domains and the binding of the same to the PAZ domian thereby
disinhibiting the RNases, and outputs a microRNA.

These ideas can be represented diagrammatically as follows:

                                    _________
PremicroRNA binding to PAZ ------ > |Dicer as|
                                    | C.D.   |---- > microRNA
PremicroRNA binding to RNAses --- > |________|


Figure 1.  Dicer as a coincidence detector (C.D.).  A coincidence detector
is characterized by its ability to produce an output if and only if two or
more inpouts are received within a narrow time window.  A general
mathematical equation relating the two inputs and the rate of the output
of a coincidence detector was derived recently [3]. Or a coincidence
detector is a device which can implement the instruction: If A and B, then
C. In the present case, A = binding of pre-microRNA to PAZ; B = binding of
pre-microRNA to RNae domains; and C = microRNA production.

The key concept justifying this postulate is that Dicer acts as a nuclease
(producing microRNA) when and only when the following three conditions are
satisfied:
    (i) The PAZ domain is occupied by the 5’-end of the pre-microRNA,
   (ii) the NRases are occupied by their target regions on the
        pre-microRNA, and
  (iii) events (i) and (ii) occur synchronously within a narrow
        time window (within say seconds?).

Condition (iii) may be necessary because of the fact that binding events
(i) and (ii) occur randomly and quite frequently (every nanosecond?) due
to thermal fluctuations (or Brownian motions) of the pre-microRNA-Dicer
complex.  Under such circumstance, it may be that the only way to control
the length of microRNAs diced out of their pre-microRNA is to trigger the
nuclease activities when and only when two events (i) and (ii) almost
coincide. It should be possible to test this hypothesis experimentally
using genetic and various spectroscopic methods.
