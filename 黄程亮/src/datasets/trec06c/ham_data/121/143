So the same script can work or not work, it just depends on the 
machine.  For a start turning on <safemode 1> will probably allow you to 
exit DMDX with greater ease when things are disintegrating.  Next up is 
checking that the refresh rate you've timed in TimeDX is actually a valid 
refresh rate.  Any number of times we've seen machines with crappy drivers 
make TimeDX somehow provide 0 ms as the refresh interval of a video 
mode.  When people don't even remotely check what TimeDX is displaying and 
go ahead and store those values in the registry DMDX comes along and tries 
to use those values and performs much the same way as you are seeing 
it.  The solution is usually to get new video drivers.  If that doesn't fix 
things sometimes (but not recently) there are switches in the Refresh Rate 
test in TimeDX that can fix the way TimeDX determines the retrace rate 
(usually turning off Read Between Flips to Stop Cheating Drivers).  If it 
is in fact the case that TimeDX is determining that the retrace interval is 
0 ms and nothing will make TimeDX's automatic determination routines work 
you can always override them with your own values (there's a bunch of 
documentation on it in the TimeDX help).
