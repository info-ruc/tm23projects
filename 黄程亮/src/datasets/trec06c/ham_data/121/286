Attn: Sir/Ma 

Re: PAYMENT SOLUTION 

I am Hon. Dr. Adeniji Olu, Minister Foreign Affairs Ministry; my office monitors and controls the affairs of all banks and financial institutions in Nigeria concerned with foreign contract/inheritance payments. 

I am the final signatory to any transfer or remittance of huge funds moving within banks both on the local and international levels in line to foreign contracts settlement.

I have before me list of funds, which could not be transferred to some nominated accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost accounts, unclaimed deposits and over-invoiced sum etc. 

I write to present you to the federal government that you are among the people expecting the funds to be transferred into their account, on this note; I wish to have a deal with you as regards to the unpaid certified contract funds. I have every files before me and the data's will be to change to your name to enable you receive the fund into your nominated bank account as the beneficiary of the fund's amount $10,000,000.00 Ten Million United State Dollars.

As it is my duty to recommend the transfer of these surplus funds to the Federal Government Treasury and Reserve Accounts as unclaimed deposits, I have the opportunity to write you based on the instructions i received 2 days ago from the Senate Committee on Contract Payments /Foreign Debts to submit the List of payment reports / expenditures and audited reports of revenues. 

Among several others, I have decided to remit this sum following my idea that we have a deal/agreement and I am going to do this legally.

MY CONDITIONS.

1. You will give me 30% of your contract/inheritance funds as soon as you confirm it in your designated bank account.

2. This deal must be kept secret forever, and all correspondence will be strictly by email / telephone, for security purposes.

3. There should be no third parties as most problem associated with your fund release are caused by your agents or representative.

If you AGREE with my conditions, l advise you on what to do immediately and the transfer will commence without delay as I will proceed to fix your name on the Payment schedule instantly to meet the six days mandate. I hope you don't reject this offer and have the funds transferred.

Please get back to me fast.

Waiting for your reply soon.
