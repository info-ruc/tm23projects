CS352-ers,

I have a couple of notes related to the review and the project:

1) I had overlooked the fact that you all have learned Java instead of 
C++.  Thus, you will be required to complete the project in Java.  You 
will need to submit source code that can be compiled on the 
departmental public linux systems.  We will compile and run it on a 
battery of test programs to determine if your programs are correct.  
More info will follow shortly.

2) The issue of WAR hazards came up in class today.  These are unusual 
in an in-order processor, but possible with variable length pipelines 
(see slide 24 from the lecture 12 slide deck).  That example includes a 
pipeline that supports two types of instructions:

a) Normal simple instructions that need just the normal five stages in 
a pipeline:  F - R - X - M - W
b) A more complicated pipeline that has a late register read stage that 
supports instructions such as:  R1 = R2 + R3*R4.  Let's call this 
instruction a "mula" for multiply and add. Such a pipeline might look 
like this:
                        F - R - X1 - X2 - X3 - X4 - R - X5 - W
Note that X1 through X4 are for the multiply, while X5 is for the add.  
In this example, R2 would not be read from the register file until the 
second R stage.  The problem with this is the following instruction 
sequence:

   mula R1, R2, R3, R4
   add  R2, R6, R7

Here the mula instruction is supposed to get the old value of R2, not 
the new value produced by the add instruction.  Now consider how these 
instructions proceed down their pipelines:

mula:                       F - R - X1 - X2 - X3 - X4 - R - X5 - W
add:                               F - R   - X    - M   - W

Note that the add instruction reaches its W stage before the mula 
reaches its second R stage.  Thus the mula will incorrectly get the new 
value of R2 - hence the WAR hazard.

This problem can come up in out-of-order pipelines in a less-contrived 
manner, and can be solved by using a technique called register 
renaming.  We will discuss this starting next week.

Cheers,

SK
