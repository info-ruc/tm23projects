You are just reinforcing my point that moral rights are a tool
of censorship.  You want to retain moral rights so that you
can censor any use of your expressions that you do not
find agreeable but not necessarily morally wrong.  This also
just shows that you value your moral rights higher than the
people's freedom of speech, another point that I made.
