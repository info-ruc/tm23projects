   Yeah, that's pretty odd.  Even if you were using an exceedingly ancient 
version of DMDX beforehand it's still odd.  It's possible to have multiple 
instances of DMDX and or TimeDX alive at the same time which can produce 
that kind of error in which case rebooting will fix it.  Otherwise I'd try 
updating video drivers and the usual sorts of tricks like deleting hardware 
to see if something else hasn't clagged the machine up.
