**************************************


Postdoctoral Position at Purdue University

The Geodynamics and Active Tectonics group at Purdue University  
(Dept. of Earth and Atmospheric Science) invites applications for a  
12-month postdoctoral research position focused on the modeling of  
crustal and lithospheric deformation constrained by geodetic  
observations. The successful candidate will join a group of faculty  
and students working on continental deformation, plate coupling and  
stress transfer at plate boundaries, postseismic processes, rheology  
of the lithosphere, and mantle-lithosphere interactions. We are  
specifically interested in candidates with a strong background and  
experience in mechanics, modeling of tectonic processes, and inverse  
methods applied to geodetic data. Experience in GPS and/or InSAR is a  
plus. The position is to be filled immediately. Applications will be  
accepted until the position is filled. Send an application  
electronically, consisting of (1) a letter of interest, (2) CV, and  
(3) the names of 3 references to ecalais@purdue.edu or  
freed@purdue.edu. Purdue University is an equal access/equal  
opportunity/affirmative action employer.
