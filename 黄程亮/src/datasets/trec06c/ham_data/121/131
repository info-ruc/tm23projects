Hello,

I had a question regarding the panel sessions for the upcoming ACRL  
conference in Baltimore.  I realize it not for another 10 months but  
the deadline is May 10th so I wanted to gather some information  
before actually submitting something.  Before I go further let me  
tell you about myself, my name is David McCaslin and presently I am a  
library supervisor at Penn State University in the Course Reserves  
department.  In addition, I am just finishing my 3rd (out of 6)  
semesters at the University of Pittsburgh, for my Masters in Library  
and Information Sciences, so I'm halfway home to my MLIS and  
hopefully becoming a librarian.  This will be my first time to an  
ACRL conference.  I will be attending the ALA conference for the  
first time in Seattle at the midwinter one--so attending conferences  
is still something new for me but I feel I have something worthwhile  
to contribute to the conference.  I have not read many postings from  
this listserv so please forgive me if the debated questions below  
have been repeated over and over.

In our course reserves at Penn State , we deal with putting regular  
(book-housed in the Reserve Reading Room) and electronic reserves up  
(online accessible through the libraries' homepage) for instructors  
and their courses.  For the electronic reserves, we deal with many  
issues regarding what can or cannot be placed on "reserve".   
Primarily, this involves the different copyright restrictions on  
placing an item on electronic access for a course (whether the book  
or journal is physically owned by the library or not).  Within the  
past year, we've seen the case with the Association of American  
Publishers and the University of California, San Diego, the  
electronic course reserves is a situation that will not go away.   
Just from my personal experiences, we at Penn State, pay tens of  
thousands of dollars (~$70,000 a semester via the Copyright Clearance  
Center) based on our own reserve procedures but for every 5  
universities dealing with course reserves and copyright, there are 5  
different copyright/course reserve procedures or protocols.  For  
instance, we use 15% of one work (excluding journal articles) as  
acceptable for an item to be placed on electronic reserve but another  
school may choose 10%, yet another 20%.

Where do academic libraries stand in supplying course reserves?  Has  
the San Diego-Association of American Publishers case changed the  
landscape?  What will the future bring in this area?  What are some  
different approaches by some University libraries?  Do or will  
instructors adjust their reserve lists based on possible copyright  
costs incurred by libraries on their behalf?  These are all questions  
I think a panel session could address these questions/issues.

The question(s) I have is: Is this something that is worthwhile to  
propose to ACRL as a panel session?  In addition, according to the  
application, I will need to list additional speakers (i.e. hopefully  
some of you) to help me lead this panel.  As I explained above, I am  
a new member and will be attending the for the first time so I didn't  
want to submit something that has already been talked about at  
length,. as well as propose something where I'm the only panel  
speaker or presenter.

Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

David J. McCaslin
Library Supervisor II - Reserves
