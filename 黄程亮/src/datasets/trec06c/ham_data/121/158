I understood the problem was restricted to some machines, but only when
displaying katakana.  Is this right?  If it is, then it can't be a problem
with video drivers -- if .rtf files using English work OK, then the problem
has to do with the katakana font.

If you send me (not the list) an .rtf file as an attachment, I'll see what
happens on our machines.  We have just completed a successful experiment
using both kanji and katakana.  Maybe you should also indicate what font you
were using when you constructed the .rtf file.
