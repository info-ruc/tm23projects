Scribe:  A Large-Scale and decentralized Application-Level Multicast
Infrastructure

Design and Evaluation of a Wide-Area Event Notification Service

Scribe is an application level multicast system that is built on top of
the Pastry distributed hash table.  Scribe provides a simple system of
creating multicast groups and using Pastry's structure to create trees
for broadcasting.  A group can either have a random Pastry node or
itself as its root rendezvous point.  When a node contacts the root to
join a group, the path to the root becomes a part of the multicast tree.
Hearbeat signals are sent to children for failure detection.  Root node
state is replicated to some number of neighbors for failure recovery.  A
system of message buffering is also proposed for further reliability.

SIENA is a system for publishing and subscribing that is based on
maximizing expressiveness and scalability.  Expressiveness is defined as
the ability for the system to capture a number of events and express
filters and patterns to optimize notifications.  SIENA opts to be
unstructured in order to avoid performance issues of structured networks
and to maintain generality.  SIENA describes a fairly complex
protocol allowing for the use of filters and also describes the
structure of its advertising and subscription language.  The paper also
considers some performance issues between hierarchical and more general
peer-to-peer network graphs.

Scribe and SIENA are quite different from each other despite dealing
with a similar issue.  Scribe is quite simple and is a clever use of
Pastry, but does not seem to go very far beyond what Pastry offers in
and of itself.  There could be some load issues if Scribe is run on a
Pastry network that is used for other purposes as well.  SIENA seems to
be largely theoretical and seems to suffer from over-complexity.
Furthermore, by focusing on expressiveness and scalability, the authors
have set aside other important issues, such as security and reliability
for future work.
