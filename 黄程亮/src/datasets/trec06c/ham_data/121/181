The public include the radio stations.  The general practice
is that the record companies lend LP's to the radio stations
to be performed at their places and when they no longer need
the LP's, they return them back to the record companies
or destroy them.  They don't have the right to sell or give
away the LP's unless they are authorized by the record
companies.

A good analogy that I can think of is the movies that the
theaters receive from the companies.  The theaters can't
sell the movies to the public or even give away to other
people or entities unless they are permitted to do so.  A
thief who break in a movie theater and steal the movies so
that he can watch them at a secret place without paying
a penny can't be simply charged with theft.

Another analogy is stealing books (think of the seventh
Harry Potter book) before they are released to the public.
(This is not to be confused with books that are sold to
the public before release date by mistake such as few
incidents with the sixth Harry Potter book.)

Suppose that you are correct that stealing LP's from
a radio station is not actionable under the copyright
law.  What remedy does the copyright owner have
in this case?  I can't imagine that the thief in the
above example on movies is untouchable to the
copyright owners.
