SCRIBE

a scalable application-level multicast infrastructure supporting a large
number of groups with any number of members in a group. Scribe is built on
the top of Pastry. Pastry is used to create and manage groups and build
trees for efficient

multicast distribution.

each group has a unique group-id which is computed using the hash of the
textual name concatenated with the creator's name.
the scribe node with the nodeid closest to the group-id acts as the root
of the multi-cast tree for the group. the authors also propose making the
creator the root of the multicast tree which seems like a better idea -
this prevents malicious nodes from overburdening other nodes by creating
groups with group-id that are close to the nodeid of the correct node.

when a scribe node joins, it uses the Pastry's join message along with the
 group-id that it wishes to join. this message is routed using Pastry.
a node is termed as a forwarder for a group if its routing table contains
entries for that group. A node becomes a forwarder

for a group when a node sends it a JOIN message for a particular group
(which is not in its routing table and provided its routing table is
free)\

the root of a group is located using Pastry and also cached for subsequent
use.

multicast trees repair:
parents send heartbeats to their children periodically. when a child
detects failure of its parent it sends a JOIN message.

root failures can be tolerated using replication and agreement protocols.



DESIGN AND EVALUATION ...:SIENA

the authors discuss the tradeoff between the maximizing the expressiveness
in the selection mechanism and maintain scalability at the same time.

the selection process is used to select clients while routing and
delivering notifications.

for a distributed system implementing a notification system, three
critical design aspects are mentioned:
1) interconnection topology between servers
2) routing algorithm
3) processing strategy -- so as to optimize message traffic

the authors adopt a general graph for their interconnection topology based
on performance issues with a hierarchal topology.

besides the publish/subscribe interface, the authors also use an
additional interface termed advertise which an object of interest uses to
advertise notifications it publishes ( unsuscribe and unadvertise also
exist)

SIENA semantics are that of a best-effort service - it must not introduce
unnecessary delays in processing but it neither prevents race conditions.
a timestamp with each notification is used to deal with latency effects.

the authors propose a hybrid architecture so as to increase efficiency by
using different architectures at different points in the network.


Patterns are matched using "Pattern Factoring" and "Pattern Delegation"
mechanisms which break a compound subscription into components and forward
the smaller elementary components.
