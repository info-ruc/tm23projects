Wolfram shows a set of photographs of real fluid turbulences on p. 377 of
his book (A New Kind of Science, 2002).  On p. 380, he shows a set of
pictures generated by iterating a simple set of programs n times, where n
ranges form 10^3 to 7x10^4.  The patterns shown in these pictures are
strikingly similar to real fluid turbulences.  Let us see how he succeeded
modeling fluid turbulence using cellular automata:

1)	He starts out with a system of 30 million cellular automata, each
represented by a node of a triangle forming a part of a hexagon.  Each
automaton in turn represents a fluid particle moving around  from one node
to another obeying simple rules emulating (or inspired by) the physical
laws governing particle collisions.

2)	The dynamic state of the fluid is represented as a system of velocity
vectors of individual particles directed along the edges of triangles.  
The direction of each vector is updated obeying a set of only 5 rules,
which can be paraphrased in words as follows:

i)	If two particles collide at the center of a hexagon along the  5-to-11
O’clock direction, then, after the collision, two particles will move away
from the center in the 3-to-9 O’clock direction.
ii)	If three particles, 1, 2 and 3, collide at the center of a hexagon,
with particles 1 and 3 (counting clock wise) moving along the 5-to-11
O’clock direction and particle 2 moving along the 3-to-9 O’clock
direction, then, after the collision, 3 particles will move away from the
center of the hexagon, two in the 1-to-7 O’clock direction and one in the
3-to-9 O’clock direction.
iii)	If three particles, 1, 2 and 3, collide at the center of a hexagon,
with particles 1 and 3 (counting clock wise) moving along the 1-to-7
O’clock direction and particle 2 moving along the 3-to-9 O’clock
direction, then, after the collision, 3 particles will move away from the
center of the hexagon, two in the 5-to-11 O’clock direction and one in the
3-to-9 O’clock direction.
iv)	If three particles, 1, 2 and 3, collide at the center of a hexagon,
with particle 1 moving along the 5-to-11 O’clock direction, particle 2
along  the 3-to-9 O’clock direction, and particle 3 along the 1-to-7
O’clock direction, then, following the collision, three particles will
move away from the center of the hexagon along the same directions
followed before collision.
v)	If four particles, 1, 2, 3 and 4, collide at the center of a hexagon,
with particle 1 moving along the 5-to-11 O’clock direction, particle 2
along  the 1-to-7 O’clock direction, particle 3 along the 5-to-11 O’clock
direction, and particle 4 along the 1-to-7 O’clock direction, then,
following the collision, four particles will move away from the center of
the hexagon, with particles 1 and 3 along the 5-to-11 O’clock direction
and particles 2 and 4 along the 3-to-9 O’clock direction.

With above five rules, Wolfram clearly succeeded in emulating the
microscopic behavior of molecules in fluid, since he was able to reproduce
real fluid turbulences with a striking accuracy as evident in the results
of computations shown on p. 380 as mentioned above.

It should be pointed out
(i) that the particles are fed into the system from the left at a speed
which is one third of the maximum speed of particles and
(ii) that clear patterns of fluid turbulence became visible only when
viewed at a high level of granularity, that is when 20x20  blocks of
automata are averaged into a single velocity vector, just as it would be
in real life: At too high a resolution, no turbulence would be discerned,
because the human eye would lose sight of the forest for trees.

Although the above modeling was done with cellular automata arranged on a
2-dimensional plane, I am sure one can extend the modeling to
3-dimensional space with additional rules specifying the behaviors of
colliding particles in 3-dimensional space.

It is my understanding that fluid turbulence is too complex a phenomenon
to be successfully modeled using hydrodynamic equations.  Even if someday
mathematicians are able to succeed in modeling fluid turbulence using
traditional mathematical equations, that would not diminish the
significance of Wolfram’s modeling of fluid turbulence using cellular
automata.   To me, cellular automata-based modeling of turbulence is as
real as any modeling of the same based on mathematical equations: Both
cellular automata systems and mathematical equations are systems of
symbols (created by human mind) representing reality with equal
legitimacy.

With all the best.
