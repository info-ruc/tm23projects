Hello,

I am trying to develop a picture naming experiment, but I am having 
measuring the reaction time using audio input.  I have the following 
parameter line:
<azk> <cr> <fd 100> <d 169> <vm 1024,768,8,0> <id DigitalVox> <id 
RecordVocal> <id keyboard> <nfb> <dbc 255255255> <dwc 0> <t 2000>


If I run the experiment, the speakers response is recorded, but  the timing 
clock does not turn off when audio input is given.  I have tried using a 
parameter <vox> but it does not affect how the experiment runs.  Is there a 
number for the <vox> parameter.?  The naming program posted on the site 
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language/DMDX/paradigms/parad15.html does not 
include a <vox> parameter, so I'm not sure if it is helpful.

Thank you for your help,
