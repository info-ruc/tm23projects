   Hopefully the INVALIDPIXELFORMAT format errors that a couple of people 
have encountered will become a thing of the past with DMDX 3.0.1.11 and 
TimeDX 3.0.08.  The problem was that even though DMDX was explicitly 
stating that the pixel information structure was not to be used when 
setting up a display poor display drivers were still checking it and of 
course it contained uninitialized data.  So now I specifically set it up to 
contain no information (and still state that it shouldn't be used) and the 
laptop here with a Trident cyberblade XP Ai1 video chipset no longer throws 
INVALIDPIXELFORMAT errors.

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
