                 RE:TRANSFER OF US$10.5 M FOR INVESTMENT.

I am SR MARTINS GOMEZ, the director of delivery/Operations Tran world =
Securities, Madrid Spain. Our firm is a company of high repute with years of =
outstanding services, especially top Government officials and military =
leaders in Africa.

I have resolved to contact you through this medium based on business proposal =
that will be of mutual benefit to both of us.  I have not discussed this =
transaction with anybody because it is of top secret. 

To be explicit and straight to the point, sometime early 2000 a reputable =
client of ours deposited a consignment in our company vault for Safe keeping. =
And since then our client has failed to come forward to claim his =
consignment, has accumulated a considerable amount of money. Consequently, in =
our bid to contact this client to redeem the demurrage which his consignment =
had accumulated we discovered that our client was the former President of the =
Federation Republic of Zaire, who died of illness after he was dethroned in =
the same year the consignment was entrusted into our care. Since the death of =
our client President Mobutu Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come =
forward to claim the consignment with us, which means that non of his =
relatives or aids has any knowledge of this consignment. Hence out of =
curiosity I decided to secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited =
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the boxes that were =
registered as treasure by our client actually contained a considerable amount =
of money in United States Dollars amounting to about US$10.5 million US =
Dollars. 

Since this development I have been nursing plans secretly. I also found out =
from enquiries and the foreign media that our late client siphoned a lot of =
money from his country while he was in office as head of state. It is my =
conviction that the consignment in our vault was part of the money that our =
client siphoned and now that he is dead there is no trace to this money in =
our care. I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me in =
transferring this money out of Madrid Spain to your country for immediate =
investment with your assistance. 

I have also decided that you will generously be entitled to 35 % while 55% =
will be for me and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses of the total =
amount. Upon my receipt of your reply confirming your willingness to assist =
me, I will immediately arrange and transfer all the rights of ownership of =
this consignment to your name to facilitate your easy clearance and transfer =
of the complete funds to your country for onwards investment. This =
transaction is 100% risk free. Please maintain absolute confidential on this =
matter. I await your most prompt response through my telephone or e-mail =
address.

Yours faithfully 
Sr. MARTINS GOMEZ +34-639-064-400
