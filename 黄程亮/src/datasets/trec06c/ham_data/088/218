SCO (which used to be Santa Cruz Operation) is now based in Utah
and eventually ended up buying the UNIX name from Novell (Novell
bought it from AT&T).  Over the last few months, SCO has been
sending out threatening letters to Linux distributors, claiming
that some code from Unix SysV (what Solaris 2.x, AIX, HP-UX,
IRIX are based on) has ended up in Linux (Linux is also very
SysVish in appearance).

Here's what the CEO of Novell has to say about the matter:

 CEO Jack Messman wrote that to his company's knowledge, SCO buying Unix
from Novelll did not transfer the associated copyrights. He said: "We
believe it unlikely that SCO can demonstrate that it has any ownership
interest whatsoever in those copyrights. Apparently tou share this view,
since... you have repeatedly asked Novell to transfer the copyrights to
SCO, requests that Novell has rejected".

He also said that SCO needed to substantiate its allegations against the
Linux community. He accused SCO of sowing fear uncertainty and doubt about
Linux "in order to extort payments from Linux distributors and users".
