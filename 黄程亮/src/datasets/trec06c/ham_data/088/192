   Looks like we might be on the cusp of solving the mysterious 
INVALIDPIXELFORMAT display error that's plagued a few machines, we finally 
have a machine here that produces the error.

   Also, Measurement Computing sent me some advertising this morning that's 
the first interesting piece of advertising I've ever got.  They're making a 
USB based PIO for $109:

   Of course, any switches built on it are going to suffer whatever 
latencies and variabilities are inherent in a USB system (and they weren't 
insignificant when I tested a USB mouse however that may have just been 
that mouse) but if you can't use a PCI interface card and don't have a 
PC-CARD slot then this is a least more elegant that hacking up a 
joystick.  If anyone's interested they might consider buying an extra one 
for us to make sure DMDX can work with it and make it work with it if it 
doesn't and to also benchmark it's performance.

Isn't it strange that the same people that laugh at gypsy fortune
tellers take economists seriously?
