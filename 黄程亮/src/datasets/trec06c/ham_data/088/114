I have been trying to setup an item file which displays things at a fixed 
rate.  It does not gather any data so should be simple, right?

What I have is :

<ep> <cr> <azk> <id "keyboard"> <vm 640,480,480,16,0> <!safemode 1> <eop>

0 "Press the continue key when ready";

0 <d 0> <%ms 2000> "one"/<c>;

0 <d 0> <%ms 2000> "two"/<c>;

0 <d 0> <%ms 2000> "three"/<c>;

0 <d 0> <%ms 2000> "Four"/<c>;

0 <d 0> <%ms 4000> <ln -2> "Line one?", <ln 2> "Line two"<c>;

0 "done";

But what happens is the single words display for the right time but the 
multiple words display for a short time (less than 1 sec).  I suspect I am 
missing something really simple as I have done this type of thing before 
without trouble.

- Using DMDX 3.0.1.9 but also tried on 3.0.1.5

Thanks
