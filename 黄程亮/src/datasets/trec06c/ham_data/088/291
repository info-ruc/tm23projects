ABIDJAN, COTE D’IVOIRE

ATTN ,



It is my pleasure to write you after my seven days fasting and prayers and much consideration since I can not be able to see you face to face at first.



Being the first and the only son of my father, late PRINCE DENNIS IBRU from BETE in Republic of COTE D’IVOIRE Africa I am 21years of age. My father was limited liability cocoa and gold merchant in ABIDJAN before his untimely death after his business tr

ip to SWITZERLAND, to negotiate on a cocoa business. A week after he came back from SWISS, he was assassinated

with my mother by unknown assassins. 



Which my mother died, instantly, but my father died after five days in hospital, on that faithful afternoon. I didn’t know that my father was 

going to leave me after I had lost my mother. But before he gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was going to die. He my father, (may his soul rest in perfect peace) he disclose to me that he deposited the sum of $7 million U.S dollars in a PRIVATE



BANK here in SWITZERLAND. That the money was meant for his cocoa business he wanted to invest in Abidjan – Côte d’Ivoire. Though, according to my father he deposited the money in his own name . 



He single handed me over the document and logging and verifying informations , and instructed me to seek for a life time investment partner 

abroad. 



Now I have succeeded in locating the BANK in SWITZERLAND and also confirmed the fund is in there , most honest and confidentiality. Now I am soliciting for your assistance to help me lift this money out from SWISS BANK to your account abroad so that we 



should invest it in any lucrative business in your country. 



I am Waiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can 

discuss the modalities of this transaction, 



Thanks for your kind attention and mutual understanding.



Best regards



TONY IBRU AND SISTER
