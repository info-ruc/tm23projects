What does DmDx depend on to be able to display the proper characters?  
The Chinese characters display fine on Windows 2000 computers with 
Office 2000, but not in Windows 98 with Office 97.  What is it about 
Windows 2000?  and how can I have DmDx display the proper characters in 
Windows 98?  Thank you.
