   In hunting down the abs() problem I came across another instance of 
sscanf() crashing the winME machine so I spent today re-arranging the 
parameter line parsing code so sscanf() can be used on it.  That is now 
available in 3.0.1.7.  Hopefully next week I'll find what's busted in the 
calculator but unfortunately that's complicated code I didn't write and 
it's making a mistake...

                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
