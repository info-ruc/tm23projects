   A couple of small changes in DMDX 3.0.1.9 and TimeDX 3.0.07 are 
available.  DMDX was managing to freak out a Sony Vaio PCG-F450 laptop with 
a Yamaha DS-GX sound device, it would tell me that the read pointer was 
ahead of the capture pointer, singularly impossible and not al all 
useful.  DMDX now detects such bad behavior but coincidentally has a 100 
millisecond sleep in there between successive calls to the 
DirectSoundCapture setup routines that appears to stop such drivers from 
getting freaked out in the first place.  Unfortunately said laptop is still 
less than useful for running DMDX as it's VOX responses creep up over time, 
no idea what's going on there but the interim fix is available anyway.

   As a side note I strongly recommend people using the RecordVocal and 
DigitalVOX devices use the capturetest.rtf item file in the demos and make 
sure they get consistent RTs around 1000ms, after seeing this laptop trash 
a whole study clearly the different manners in which audio drivers can 
malfunction has yet to be completely plumbed.

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
