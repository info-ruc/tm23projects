Sorry for the delay. I tested one of the Chinese files I used on my laptop. It works fine. Then I wrote another item file with Chinese words in it, and tested it on a Dell in my lab. I didn't receive any error message, but what is showing are unrecognizable codes, not Chinese. I will keep working on it when I get time. If I can figure out why, I will let you know.    --Nan Jiang
