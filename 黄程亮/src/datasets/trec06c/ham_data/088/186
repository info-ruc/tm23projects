Hi Arnab,

You may download another free development system for Xilinx
devices called WebPACK, see
http://www.xilinx.com/xlnx/xil_prodcat_landingpage.jsp?title=ISE+WebPack

Although the number of targeted devices is limited in this 
system, it will allow you to create, compile, P&R and verify
your design from the first to the last step (unlike Synplify which
is a synthesis only). So try it...
