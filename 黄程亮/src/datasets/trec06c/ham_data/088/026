   Hmm, looks like something subtle is busted in there.  abs() of 
expressions functions unless that expression is just a counter.  Looks like 
the value displayed is the address of that counter.  For a cheap fix till I 
find out what's wrong use <set c1=abs(0 + c1)>.

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
