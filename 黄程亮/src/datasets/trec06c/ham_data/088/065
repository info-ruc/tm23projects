this question was asked previously

(although the origin of the bug does not need to be the same)

1/ try checking the read only status of your files (in windows explorer)

Subject: [DMDX] write to output file, disk full


Hi
I am currently running a masked faces experiment
under dmdx

I can run the prog under syntax check but receive an error  when the
first face has been shown
"Write to output file , disk full

the disk isn't full. however I think there might be a buffer overrun??
 have tried the timedx to tune the system/ and changed video settings
Have loaded the latest dmdx

to no avail
would appreciate some help
