Maggie, 
First, I'm wondering if you and John Braastad had a chance 
to talk about making recommendations to provide incentives 
and standareds for maintaining ephemeral wetlands that we 
can include in our discussion of CSP?  

On a related note...I had a good visit with Lance Yohe and 
Kevin Schiedecker on Monday.  The RRBC is planning to move 
from the inventory reports to "Framework" documents, that 
are short of a detailed plan, but which do include vision 
statements, goals and objectives, and which focus on one 
topic at a time, like the inventory reports. Kevin will be 
putting together the reports, starting with Flood Damage 
Reduction this year.  Conservation and Drainage might come 
in 2004.  I'm working on an idea to dovetail whatever we do 
with the Conservaiton Opportunities project and the Natural 
resources roundtable discussion on landuse and hydrology 
with the RRBC's framework document development.  Here are 
some of the elements of the idea:
 - provide a series of conservation recommendations that 
optimize the ecological services in regions with working ag 
lands.  (CSP, EQIP, CREP)
 - support research on the water quality, channel 
morphology, biological indicators of tile drainage + surface 
drainage compared to current system of surface drainage, and 
compared to reference areas.  (Wayne Goeken tells me 
Riverwatch is funded through June, and at this time, the 
future is unknown)
I'm still in the process of putting ideas on paper, please 
think about possibilities and help me out. 
One of the suggestions at the water quality roundtable was 
to satisfy ourselves with our current stage of drainage. 
What can NWP do that doesn't drive the system further, but 
rather answers these questions quickly, and gets the debate 
going in ther gion so we choose the path that leads to the 
place we want to be in the future?
