Just a quick note to say that avoiding Dell Latitudes is still good
advice if my 2.5 year-old CPx-H500, and a colleague's 0.5 year-old
Latitude (unknown model) are anything to go by... The particularly weird
thing about both of these was that the millisecond timer test was giving
odd results in both cases:

On mine, the timer test was giving an average of about 1.2ms, and with a
very large standard deviation (about 0.8-0.9 msec). After making sure
that a BIOS upgrade didn't fix the problem, Dell replaced the
motherboard (including CPU), but the problem persisted. Since the
motherboard was replaced a 2nd time, it's worked fine...

Similarly, the more recent Latitude that I've seen also gives standard
deviations that are larger than ideal (though not quite so extreme, and
the mean is 1.0msec).

Hope that helps,
Stuart.
