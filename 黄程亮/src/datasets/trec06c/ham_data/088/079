Dear list members,

My experiment alternates between two types of items:
- simple ones requiring a timed picture naming response
- complex ones where the subject gives a series of verbal responses, and 
the experimenter must press a key to progress to the next item.

This means I need DMDX to respond on the simple trials to the voicekey, 
and on the complex trials to the keyboard, but importantly NOT to the 
voicekey, as subjects will be talking.
I have tried to disengage the voicekey using <UnMapRequest>, but without 
success: it still triggers to verbal responses.

Here's my attempt to make it work:

<azk> <cr> <clfb> <id "keyboard"> <id DigitalVOX> <vm 640,480,16,0>
0 "Press spacebar to start";
+1 <ms% 800> _____ _____ _____ / <ms% 500> / * <umr> <mpr +Space> 
<ntl> <ln -2> sentence1, <ln 0> sentence2, <ln 2> sentence3 /!;
+2 <ms% 2000> * * * * */ <ms% 500> / * <umr> <mpr +DigitalVox> <fd 
254> <t 3000> <bmp> picture1;
+3 * <fd 254> <t 3000> <bmp> picture2;
0 This is the end ";

Thanks for any assistance
Rachel
