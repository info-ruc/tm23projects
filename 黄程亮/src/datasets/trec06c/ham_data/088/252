   Who knows, we sure don't.  It's not a question of what DMDX needs, it's 
a question of what Windows needs, more to the point the GDI component of 
Windows. All DMDX sees is a string in an item file and a request to render 
it in a particular font which it passes off to GDI and says render 
it.  With the advent of 2000 they re-wrote all the display code and made it 
Unicode aware and by and large made it work properly which is why we say 
use 2k or XP for non-Roman fonts.  Otherwise you'll either have to use some 
Chinese character kludge windows add on thing or take snap shots of the 
display on the 2000 box and turn them into bitmaps for 98 to display, which 
you _really_ don't want to do.
