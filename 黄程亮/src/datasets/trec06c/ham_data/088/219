> Here's what the CEO of Novell has to say about the matter:

If you've got a little time on your hands, Eric Raymond of OSI started
an amicus curiae brief (that he doesn't intend to file on advice from
counsel) that is totally damning wrt SCO's claims... it's been
endorsed by OSI's board and this is a classic quote:

"SCO is alleging that IBM misappropriated from SCO technologies which
do not appear in SCO's own product."

(there's also a German firm that is suing SCO for bad business
practices...)
