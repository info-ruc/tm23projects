   Well our beloved little 1985 expression evaluator by Bob Brodt sure was 
dropping the ball evaluating a expression that only had an lvalue in 
it.  Might be because of the way DMDX uses the evaluator but it's still a 
valid use of it (wish I could find the original code to check it but all 
that's left is what's built into DMDX now, oops).  Hopefully I've pulled it 
apart enough to have made the right extensions to it in DMDX 3.0.1.8 so it 
can now evaluate "function(counterN)" correctly.  People using counters in 
expressions with brackets would do well to make sure I haven't busted their 
usage, I've tested a number of expression forms that are likely to be 
affected but can't of course test all possible usages.  And such testing 
would best be done soon before I forget all the nuances of the expression 
parser...

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
