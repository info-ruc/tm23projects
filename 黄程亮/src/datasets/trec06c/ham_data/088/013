Southport, CT, April 25, 2006/ DiversityBusiness's latest event, the Sixth National Multicultural Business Conference brought together 850 people from all over the United States. Once again, the diversity business world came together under one roof, to network, to learn from one another, to exchange ideas, approaches and strategies, and, in the case of some, to be formally recognized for their hard work and commitment to multicultural markets in the United States. <BR><BR>
Participants took full advantage of the speeches, workshops and panels-as well as the social and networking aspects of the conference. Produced for diversity business owners and the corporations, government agencies and academic institutions that utilize their services, the DiversityBusiness conference offered a solid platform for the kind of interactivity, exchange and networking that is usually missing from daily business life, due to physical distance, busy work schedules and other factors. 
<BR><BR>Companies formally honored at the conference were the winners of the Div50 and the Div100 listings, which honor, respectively, the Fortune 500 companies and government agencies most dedicated to supporting diversity and the nation's top diversity-owned businesses. <BR><BR>
"We're looking forward to another dynamic, successful year of multicultural business," said Kenton Clarke, CEO of DiversityBusiness. "The U.S. is so vast, and business moves so fast, that were it not for events such as this one, the key underpinning of lasting, rewarding business relationships-face-to-face contact-would slowly fade into the background. Each year we see new faces, and they bring fresh ideas, new perspectives, strategies and of course new technologies and processes. This is the 
value core of our conference-facilitating valuable knowledge and networking to our attendees." <BR><BR><STRONG>Conference Highlights</STRONG> <BR>
<UL>
<LI>Keynote address by Hector Barreto Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) 
<LI>Presentations by some of the worlds leading diversity experts including: Miriam Muley CEO of 85% Niche, Jane Sanders, Rosalyn Taylor ONeale and Xiao-Hua Shen from China. 
<LI>DiversityBusiness honored Lockheed Martin and the United States Postal Service as the Top Corporation and Government Agency for Multicultural Business Opportunities of 2006. Sitting at the top of DiversityBusiness's Div50 list, an indicator of which organizations provide the best and the most business for multicultural companies, they are bestowed with this honor by over 500,000 voting diversity business owners. 
<LI>The rest of the Div50 corporations and government agencies were also honored at the event: the Minority Business Development Agency, NASA, the SBA and others for the agencies, and for the companies, Cisco, Dell, IBM, BellSouth, and many others. The voting business owners based their decisions on such factors as the volume, consistency and quality of business opportunities granted to women and minority-owned companies. 
<LI>
Not to be left behind, the top diversity-owned businesses were honored as well: their list is called the Div100, a classification that represents the top 100 U.S. diversity-owned (women, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians, Native Indian and other minority groups) businesses in sectors such as technology, manufacturing, food service and professional services. Ranging in revenue size from $60 million to over $1 billion, these companies represent the nation's top multicultural earners and challenge the 
long-held notion that a diversity-owned business is small or insignificant. </LI></UL>
<P align=left><STRONG>Personal Connections</STRONG><BR>Perhaps the most valuable take-away for conference attendees were the new personal connections forged during the event. Held in a non-traditional conference environment (the Mirage in Las Vegas, participants were able to network, attend speeches, take part in workshops and socialize. <BR><BR><B>Sponsors</B><BR>

The Div50 is produced annually by DiversityBusiness, the nation's leading multicultural B2B Internet portal that links large
