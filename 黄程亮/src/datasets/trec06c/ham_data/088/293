PAUL HAAGEN '72 left his mark on Haverford athletics as one of the 
College's first lacrosse players and a Rhodes Scholar. Paul took his 
interest in college sports with him when he became a member of the Duke 
University Law School faculty and thereafter an advisor to Duke athletes 
seeking pro sports careers. Paul is now co-director of the North Carolina 
institution's Center for Sports Law and Policy, and is much in demand 
internationally as a consultant and pundit.

Haagen, whose son CHRIS will be a member of Haverford's Class of 2007, was 
quoted extensively this week on the
membership controversy involving Duke's own Atlantic Coast Conference and 
its proposed expansion at the expense of the Big East Conference. Said Paul 
in USA TODAY on June 16: "That somebody would call somebody else 
names....  (Editor's Note: as almost everyone seems to be doing in this 
issue)....I think people are saying 'We're big boys and we know that's a 
tactical activity.' But it's a symbol of how dramatically this is unlike 
the way in which we in higher education do business."

Paul also noted, "The language being directed at Miami is extraordinarily 
harsh, and the language directed at President (Donna) Shalala (of Miami) is 
extraordinarily harsh. A number of remaining schools in the Big East have 
said, 'We'll bury the hatchet,' but there are going to be very bad 
feelings. I would expect that if this (joining the ACC) fails, Miami would 
be looking for another home."

The ACC/Big East drama is being acted against a background of "reform" in 
other precincts of the NCAA, including the Ivy League and the Centennial 
Conference. It will be interesting to see where this all goes in the near 
future, and of course Scoreline might be persuaded to offer further 
thoughts from this corner of the college world at some point.
