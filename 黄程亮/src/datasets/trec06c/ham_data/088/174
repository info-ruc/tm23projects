   You'll have to nominate some fraction of that time that the children 
can't react in, DMDX needs time to prepare items.  Depending on the speed 
of your machine it might be a little as 50 ms but most machines take longer 
to read bitmaps -- examining preparation times as per the notes will tell 
you what your machine is capable of.  You'll want to set the D parameter to 
that value and subtract it from your timeout.  You'll also want to make the 
display last for the desired duration so items with reactions to them 
aren't shorter as per usual DMDX tactics to get fixed trial 
lengths.  Probable solution assuming 500 ms ISI is along the lines of:

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
