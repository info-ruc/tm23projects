   If the registry says the refresh interval is 22 ms DMDX is going to do 
it's damndest to make the refresh interval 22 ms so timing a stimuli no 
longer means anything -- hasn't since DMTG.  22 ms isn't a possible refresh 
rate.

   Stick the latest DMDX on it, version 3's retrace rate determination code 
is almost flawless.  The only times I've seen it fail are on machines with 
hopeless video drivers where DMDX couldn't possibly run, there were 
enormous visual artifacts and TimeDX simply bombed out saying it couldn't 
determine the retrace rate.
