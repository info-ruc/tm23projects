   The mechanics are that the comma frame delimiter is exactly equivalent to:

                 %0 / !

   So in any series of comma delimited frames only the duration of the last 
frame has any significance.  The usage should be:

0 <d 0> <ln -2> "Line one?", <%ms 4000> <ln 2> "Line two"/<c>;

                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X

Isn't it strange that the same people that laugh at gypsy fortune
