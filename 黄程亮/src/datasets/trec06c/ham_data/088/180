   Looks like the old "start /wait" batch file command line trick for DMDX 
is going to fail with version 3.  The problem lies with the MS installer we 
now use in that the shortcuts made to run DMDX don't actually run DMDX, 
they run some "smart" MS software that makes sure DMDX's components are in 
place and then that runs DMDX.  So if you have a batch file the "start 
/wait DMDX.EXE" wait for the installer to finish executing and then 
proceeds but of course DMDX is still running and certainly hasn't finished 
running the item file.  So you'd think that a shortcut like "c:\program 
files\dmdx\dmdx.exe" would get around this but there's some insidious 
smartness going on and that still executes the installer -- that or there's 
another reason I can think of to explain why "start /wait" would all of a 
sudden stop working for version 3.  The brute force way I fixed it was to 
copy DMDX.EXE to another directory and start /wait the copy which works 
just fine.  Until you install the next version of DMDX of course when 
you'll have to copy the executable again but by that time you've forgotten 
what's going on...

Isn't it strange that the same people that laugh at gypsy fortune
