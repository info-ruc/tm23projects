Hi there,

I have just begun working with DMDX and I am having a problem getting the 
following item file to do as I intend.  Below is a stripped down version of 
the item file.  My aim is to design a simple reaction time task to use with 
children.  There are two pictures used throughout the task.  These pictures 
are presented individually for 2 seconds (frame duration) with an interval 
of 3 seconds (delay) between the presentation  of the pictures.  Children 
are instructed to respond when they are presented with a picture on the 
screen but not respond to another picture.

I want the children to be able to respond for that whole 5 seconds 
(time-out). That is:
frame duration 2 seconds + delay 3 seconds = 5 seconds.

However what DMDX seems to be doing is waiting for the timeout to finish 
(the 5 seconds) then there is the delay of 3 seconds.  I don't want this as 
I want the interval to be the same every time for every child.

Can someone provide me with help or an example item ?

Thank-you in advance
Kelly
