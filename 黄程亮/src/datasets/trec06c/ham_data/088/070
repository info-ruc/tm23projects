   You can use the <LookingTime> key word to get times keys are pressed, 
but that's only within one item, your solution will require multiple items 
and <lookingtime> isn't going to help there as it won't see the first key 
press in subsequent items.

   I've yet to think of a solution beyond adding code to DMDX.  I'll see if 
any solution comes to mind during the day.
