   I was thinking that you could do it because when the <LookingTime> code 
sees a key released with no key press it takes the clock on time as the 
pressed time, likewise if there's no release it takes the end of the item 
as the release time.  To do what you want you'd have to break your 5 second 
display up into small chunks and loop backwards summing looking times 
across the chucks -- but if the lookingtime key didn't change state during 
one of those chunks DMDX wouldn't see it at all.  So pending further 
epiphanies the only way I can see that your task would become possible is 
for a whole new class of response to be created, a response that DMDX 
doesn't see unless a key is held for a cumulative duration.  Which means 
you'd have to buy the department a nice big serial ATA drive...

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
