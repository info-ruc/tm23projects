   No doubt, it's rather a pain to implement however.

   You are perfectly welcome to sponsor DMDX additions by donating some 
piece of hardware to the department -- usually a big hard disk.

   Countless people have remarked about our not selling DMDX.  First off, a 
lot of people tend to use DMDX primarily because it's free so of our 200 
odd registered users a substantial number are gone.  Lets say we need at 
least one full time employee to do this (unrealistic), that's going to cost 
about $100,000 annually.  Say we've got 100 labs willing to pay $1000 (good 
luck, most people aren't even interested in donating a hard disk), that's 
the first year's costs met -- no profit.  And that's one year, where's next 
year's money gonna come from?  Business is work, a large part of my job is 
still fun, I like to keep it that way.

Isn't it strange that the same people that laugh at gypsy fortune
