In general laptops are a lot more tolerant of DMDX now than they used to 
be. Back in the bad old days, it was a rare thing to find a laptop with 
anything over 1Mb of video-ram, a decent integrated sound card, etc.

These days, the specifications on laptops are much better suited to DMDX. 
Newer versions of DirectX seem to be better integrated into Windows and 
give fewer problems. For instance, my (4 year-old) Sony Vaio didn't use to 
run DMDX version 1.x, but now seems to cope perfectly well with DMDX 
version 2.x even using (the now ancient) DirectX 6.

Hope this helps,

Matt
