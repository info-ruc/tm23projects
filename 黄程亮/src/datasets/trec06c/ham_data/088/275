Hello all:
   Yesterday I install windows2003(Enterprise) on my computer, and I think it's
good operation system. But when I run DMDX's TimeDX to test the refresh rate it
give me a error message:"DirectX reports no support for Page Flipping. The video
card in this machine is not adequate for DMDX's purpose." Why? Expecting your kind
reply.


Wang, GM
