I've rarely seen good deals on the tsw site for generic PC's.

Usually they are a few months behind the deals directly from the vendors.

So far, I've ordered two refurbished dell's and they have been working
just fine.  One arrived three months ago.  The other last month.
And the prices were extremely good.  Both are heavily used.

So, I recommend taking a look at the refurbed dells.
