Hi,

         I have someone who thinks seeing the run dialogue box that flashes 
up for an instant at the start of a DMDX run is a problem.  Is there a way 
to have DMDX jump straight into a task?

I'm using a command like
dmdx.exe -run whatever.rtf
exactly as Jonathan suggests

Thanks in advance
PETEr
