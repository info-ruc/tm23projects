   I've made a small but significant change to in the branching code for 
3.0.1.6.  It occurred to me that if when DMDX found that a branch 
destination wasn't in an item file it could check the list of item 
locations it buffered and if the item number was there branch to it 
instead.  This means that negative branch destination item numbers are no 
longer necessary -- a good thing because if I never remember to put minus 
signs in for backwards branches I'm willing to bet almost no one else does 
either.  People with complicated branching might want to check that I 
didn't do something stupid...

   There is an easy answer to your problem that is neat,
plausible, and wrong.
