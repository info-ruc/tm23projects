   From the <Input Device> help:

The redesigned RecordVocal device introduced in version 3.0.0.09 can now 
use two parameters. When used without any parameters it runs in legacy mode 
where it records vocalizations for the entire timeout period. Parameter N1 
if used changes the length of data recorded to be N1 milliseconds longer 
than the trigger provided by the DigitalVox device. Currently DMDX only 
records extra data for approximately the period specified. The last 
parameter N2 determines how much overrun protection DMDX allows and is by 
default 50ms -- I don't expect anyone will ever have to use this but for 
completeness I include it. If you want RecordVocal to run in legacy mode 
but need to lengthen the overrun protection specify N1 as zero. The new 
RecordVocal code can also be aborted with the Abort key.
