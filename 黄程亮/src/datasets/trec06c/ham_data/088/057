Hi,

I am writing to get some advice about a computer that is displaying a 
really slow refresh rate (22msec).  I am running simple experiments 
involving text and for some reason one of the computers is much slower 
than the others.  Is there anything I can do to increase the refresh 
rate?  I have timed some 1 minute stimuli with the relevant number of 
ticks and it is the case that the rate is this slow, so it is not that 
the refresh rate reported in the azk files is incorrect.

This computer is running windows 98 and using DMDX Version 2.6 

Thanks in advance

Emma
