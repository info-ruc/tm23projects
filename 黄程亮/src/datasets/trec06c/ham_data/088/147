   Prior to the DigitalVOX device's creation all VOX work was done this 
way.  The VOXs were wired into the VOX Input on the PIO and the MIP word 
was modified to suit.  Hardware VOXs are universally terrible in our 
experience, and if you think the DigitalVOX isn't pleasant you probably 
haven't had to deal with a hardware VOX...
