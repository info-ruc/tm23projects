I attempted to to what was suggested before, but either the item file 
does not run, stating

"RTF control word <\loch> used in quoted text, not supported". 

or if it does run the characters are displayed as gibberish.  We are 
using version 3.0.0.13 on Windows 2000.  I believe that when we got it 
to run (but not display properly) it was on a Windows 95 and a fairly 
old version of dmdx.  Any help will be appreciated, thank you.
