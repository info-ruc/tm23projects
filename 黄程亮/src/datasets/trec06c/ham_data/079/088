Our principal, Dr. Liptak, arranged coverage initially by having teachers cover other
teachers for 2 hours on Mondays from 1:00-3:00. Now, she has built in lesson study into the
school schedule and we have 80 minute lesson study meetings every week according to grade
level clusters. On days we teach the lessons our principal again shuffles staff members
having teachers teach in other teacher's classrooms.
