It's not so much an issue of the font, but of the encoding.
On systems with support for scalable fonts, "text" fonts
are all reencoded to platform specific encoding.

Char code 128 is where Windows ANSI encoding has it.
So unless you want to make a political statement about MS,
this seems a reasonable choice.

The reason some fonts call this glyph by the name "uni20ac"
is that it took a while for "Euro" to make it into some operating
system and font support.  Meantime, ATM widely supported
the convention that unixxxx could be used to access glyphs
that had corresponding Unicode positions (despite all the
rethoric, most characters corresponds to glyphs, and vice versa).

By the way, its lower case "uni".

Also, some person at Adobe
decided to make "Euro" upper case, when "sterling", "dollar"
"florin" etc. are all lower case. Sigh.

Some fonts (like LucidaBright text fonts) have both "Euro"
and "uni20AC" names for this glyphs so they'll work in the
widest set of possible situations.

The reuse of "currency" was to help the Mac deal with this
issue.  Since its "wide" font support was/is in flux, they decided
to reuse the slot for "currency" for this purpose. But this
should not have had any effect on the font itself. Simply the
"Euro" in the font is encoded at character code 219 instead
of the older "currency" (which is then inaccessible).

Regards, Berthold.
