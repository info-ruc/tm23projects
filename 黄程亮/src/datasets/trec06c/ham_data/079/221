Apple had been shipping ATM with the MacOS for some time before MacOS X
came out in `nearly good enough for end users' form.

Yep - absolutely (I suspect - but haven't checked - that it can use pfbs as
well; certainly MacOS 9.2.2 can use Truetype founts with the fount data
kept in the data fork Windoze-style, *providing* that you also have a FOND
resource to go with the fount file proper.  I suspect that pfbs work
similarly straightforwardly under MacOS X, perhaps more so) - MacOS X uses
Display PDF for screen drawing, although Apple's managed to cock it up
quite badly (there are encoding issues...)
