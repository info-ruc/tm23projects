Bayeux: an architecture for scalable and fault-tolerant wide-area data
dissemination, Zhuang, Zhao, Joseph, Katz, and Kubiaowitz.

Reviewer: Indranil Gupta

This paper discusses multicast overlay schemes on top of the Tapestry
routing framework. The algorithm is very similar to multicast routing
in Pastry, where objects are associated with an id in the name space,
and trees are constructed from receivers by including all nodes on the
path to the root. The major deviation from Pastry's algorithms are
that multiple roots are used in Bayeux, and that Bayeux talks about
fault-tolerant packet delivery.

Comments:

- The Bayeux schemes for 'fault-resilient' routing (by using backup
  paths) tolerate only a certain number of failures (message losses,
  node crashes) in the network. In that sense, it only seems to be
  'best-effort' fault-tolerance. There is no analysis of the behavior
  of Bayeux for applications that require *reliable* delivery of
  packets. Ack-based or nak-based protocols, such as SRM and RMTP,
  that are typically used for Internet multicast groups, are known to
  have scalability problems, in terms of message implosion with rising
  multicast group size.
