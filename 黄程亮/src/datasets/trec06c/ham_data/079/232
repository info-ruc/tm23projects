Subject: successor to TeXBase1Encoding  with /Euro

Hi,

there are more and more fonts around, which have an /Euro glyph.
TeXBase1Encoding does, however, not include the Euro sign, so
it is lost, when such a font is reencoded to 8r.

We need a successor to 8r.enc, which includes the /Euro.  (And, 
of course, a matching 8r.etx file for fontinst, but that's trivial.) 

There are still some free slots in 8r, so it should not be too 
difficult to find one, where to put the /Euro.  What about 0x80?
Many existing fonts do already use this slot.

A further question is the glyph name.  The fonts, which I 
examined so far, use /Euro, rather than /Uni20AC.  See, e.g., 
the new Euro-enabled fonts from Linotype.  (Some fonts use
/currency for the Euro symbol; they work with the existing 
8r.enc and just need special treatment in fontinst.)

Finally, we have to agree on the name of the encoding and the name 
of the .enc file.  What about "TeXEuro1Encoding" and "8re.enc"?

I would like to publish (on my homepage) the TFMs and VFs for 
several fonts, which include the Euro sign.  I'd be happy,
if we could agree soon on a new standard encoding to be used 
in addition to (or: as a successor to) 8r.

best wishes

Walter
