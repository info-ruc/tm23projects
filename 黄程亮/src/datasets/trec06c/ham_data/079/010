John and Gerry,
 
My office prepared a poster announcing the NSF MRI awards. I was planning to
have the poster on display as you entered the Gottwald Building for the
Ramaley visit--Poster on an easel. I was informed that if I left the
poster/easel overnight that the poster/easel would most likely be stolen.  
 
So, with this in mind, please recommend a location where the poster can be
mounted to the wall.  The poster's purpose--inform students and others, of
the support/recogntion that UR is receiving from external organizations.  Is
there a location as you enter the building?? Your suggestions, please.
