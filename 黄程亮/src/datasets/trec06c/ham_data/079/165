Dear Lesson Study Community,

We are pleased to announce a new collaboration between the Lesson 
Study Research Group and the School Renewal Web Center, which 
currently hosts a discussion forum on lesson study.  This discussion 
forum provides individuals who are interested or engaged in lesson 
study with the opportunity to conduct online conversations.  It can 
be used to post questions, raise issues, and share insights about 
lesson study-related topics.  

In the past few months, we have noticed a number of messages on this 
listserv where some of you have posed interesting questions about 
lesson study.  We hope that this discussion forum can provide you 
with a platform for recording your discussions, and for allowing 
others to read about or participate in any ongoing conversations 
about lesson study.  You can use this discussion forum to pose your 
question or exchange ideas, and you can even choose to be notified by 
e-mail when someone responds to your message.  However, if you would 
like to announce a lesson-study related event, share a resource, or 
network with other members of the lesson study community, please 
continue to use the Lesson Study Listserv for this purpose.  This 
listserv, which currently reaches 550+ individuals, can also be used 
to announce a new topic on the discussion forum and solicit more 
responses from a larger community of individuals who are interested 
in lesson study.  

Instructions for using the discussion forum are available at: 
www.tc.columbia.edu/lessonstudy/discussionforums.html.   We would 
like to again thank the School Renewal Web Center 
(www.schoolrenewal.org) for collaborating with the Lesson Study 
Research Group on this project, with special thanks to Margaret 
Riel.
