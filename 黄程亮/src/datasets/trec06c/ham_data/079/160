   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

   Products  from  a  very  wide  variety of vendors may be affected. See
   Vendor Information for details from vendors who have provided feedback
   for this advisory.

   In  addition to the vendors who provided feedback for this advisory, a
   list  of  vendors  whom  CERT/CC contacted regarding these problems is
   available from
   http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/854306
   http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/107186 

   Many  other systems making use of SNMP may also be vulnerable but were
   not specifically tested.

Overview

   Numerous  vulnerabilities have been reported in multiple vendors' SNMP
   implementations.   These   vulnerabilities   may   allow  unauthorized
   privileged   access,  denial-of-service  attacks,  or  cause  unstable
   behavior.  If  your  site  uses  SNMP  in  any  capacity,  the CERT/CC
   encourages you to read this advisory and follow the advice provided in
   the Solution section below.

   In addition to this advisory, we also have an FAQ available at
   http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/snmp_faq.html

I. Description

   The  Simple  Network  Management  Protocol (SNMP) is a widely deployed
   protocol  that is commonly used to monitor and manage network devices.
   Version  1  of  the  protocol  (SNMPv1)  defines several types of SNMP
   messages  that  are  used  to  request  information  or  configuration
   changes,  respond  to  requests,  enumerate  SNMP  objects,  and  send
   unsolicited  alerts.  The  Oulu  University  Secure  Programming Group
   (OUSPG,  http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/)  has reported numerous
   vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 implementations from many different vendors.
   More information about SNMP and OUSPG can be found in Appendix C

   OUSPG's  research  focused  on  the  manner in which SNMPv1 agents and
   managers  handle  request  and  trap  messages. By applying the PROTOS
   c06-snmpv1 test suite
   (http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/testing/c06/snmpv1/0100.h
   tml)  to  a  variety  of  popular  SNMPv1-enabled  products, the OUSPG
   revealed the following vulnerabilities:

   VU#107186 - Multiple vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 trap handling 

     SNMP trap messages are sent from agents to managers. A trap message
     may  indicate  a warning or error condition or otherwise notify the
     manager about the agent's state. SNMP managers must properly decode
     trap  messages  and  process  the resulting data. In testing, OUSPG
     found multiple vulnerabilities in the way many SNMP managers decode
     and process SNMP trap messages.

   VU#854306 - Multiple vulnerabilities in SNMPv1 request handling 

     SNMP  request  messages  are  sent from managers to agents. Request
     messages  might be issued to obtain information from an agent or to
     instruct  the  agent to configure the host device. SNMP agents must
     properly decode request messages and process the resulting data. In
     testing,  OUSPG found multiple vulnerabilities in the way many SNMP
     agents decode and process SNMP request messages.

   Vulnerabilities  in  the  decoding  and  subsequent processing of SNMP
   messages  by  both managers and agents may result in denial-of-service
   conditions,  format string vulnerabilities, and buffer overflows. Some
   vulnerabilities  do  not  require  the SNMP message to use the correct
   SNMP community string.

   These   vulnerabilities   have   been  assigned  the  CVE  identifiers
   CAN-2002-0012 and CAN-2002-0013, respectively.

II. Impact

   These  vulnerabilities may cause denial-of-service conditions, service
   interruptions,  and in some cases may allow an attacker to gain access
   to  the  affected  device.  Specific impacts will vary from product to
   product.

III. Solution

   Note  that  many  of  the  mitigation steps recommended below may have
   significant  impact on your everyday network operations and/or network
   architecture.  Ensure  that  any  changes  made based on the following
   recommendations  will  not  unacceptably  affect  your ongoing network
   operations capability.

Apply a patch from your vendor

   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   Please  consult this appendix to determine if you need to contact your
   vendor directly.

Disable the SNMP service

   As  a  general  rule,  the CERT/CC recommends disabling any service or
   capability   that   is   not   explicitly  required,  including  SNMP.
   Unfortunately,  some  of  the  affected  products exhibited unexpected
   behavior  or  denial  of  service conditions when exposed to the OUSPG
   test  suite  even  if  SNMP was not enabled. In these cases, disabling
   SNMP should be used in conjunction with the filtering practices listed
   below to provide additional protection.

Ingress filtering

   As a temporary measure, it may be possible to limit the scope of these
   vulnerabilities  by  blocking  access  to SNMP services at the network
   perimeter.

   Ingress  filtering  manages the flow of traffic as it enters a network
   under  your  administrative  control.  Servers  are typically the only
   machines that need to accept inbound traffic from the public Internet.
   In  the  network usage policy of many sites, there are few reasons for
   external hosts to initiate inbound traffic to machines that provide no
   public  services.  Thus,  ingress filtering should be performed at the
   border   to   prohibit   externally   initiated   inbound  traffic  to
   non-authorized  services. For SNMP, ingress filtering of the following
   ports  can  prevent  attackers  outside of your network from impacting
   vulnerable  devices  in  the  local  network  that  are not explicitly
   authorized to provide public SNMP services.

   snmp     161/udp     # Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
   snmp     162/udp     # SNMP system management messages

   The  following  services  are  less  common,  but  may be used on some
   affected products

   snmp               161/tcp     #  Simple  Network  Management Protocol
   (SNMP)
   snmp               162/tcp     # SNMP system management messages
   smux               199/tcp     # SNMP Unix Multiplexer
   smux               199/udp     # SNMP Unix Multiplexer
   synoptics-relay    391/tcp     # SynOptics SNMP Relay Port
   synoptics-relay    391/udp     # SynOptics SNMP Relay Port
   agentx             705/tcp     # AgentX
   snmp-tcp-port     1993/tcp     # cisco SNMP TCP port
   snmp-tcp-port     1993/udp     # cisco SNMP TCP port

   As  noted  above, you should carefully consider the impact of blocking
   services that you may be using.

   It  is  important  to note that in many SNMP implementations, the SNMP
   daemon may bind to all IP interfaces on the device. This has important
   consequences  when  considering  appropriate packet filtering measures
   required  to  protect  an  SNMP-enabled device. For example, even if a
   device  disallows  SNMP  packets  directed  to the IP addresses of its
   normal  network  interfaces, it may still be possible to exploit these
   vulnerabilities  on that device through the use of packets directed at
   the following IP addresses:
     * "all-ones" broadcast address
     * subnet broadcast address
     * any  internal  loopback  addresses  (commonly  used in routers for
       management purposes, not to be confused with the IP stack loopback
       address 127.0.0.1)

   Careful  consideration  should  be  given  to  addresses  of the types
   mentioned  above  by  sites  planning  for packet filtering as part of
   their mitigation strategy for these vulnerabilities.

   Finally,  sites may wish to block access to the following RPC services
   related to SNMP (listed as name, program ID, alternate names)

   snmp               100122  na.snmp snmp-cmc snmp-synoptics snmp-unisys
   snmp-utk
   snmpv2             100138  na.snmpv2     # SNM Version 2.2.2
   snmpXdmid          100249

   Please  note  that  this workaround may not protect vulnerable devices
   from internal attacks.

Filter SNMP traffic from non-authorized internal hosts

   In  many networks, only a limited number of network management systems
   need to originate SNMP request messages. Therefore, it may be possible
   to configure the SNMP agent systems (or the network devices in between
   the  management  and  agent systems) to disallow request messages from
   non-authorized systems. This can reduce, but not wholly eliminate, the
   risk  from  internal attacks. However, it may have detrimental effects
   on  network  performance  due  to  the  increased  load imposed by the
   filtering, so careful consideration is required before implementation.
   Similar  caveats  to  the  previous workaround regarding broadcast and
   loopback addresses apply.

Change default community strings

   Most  SNMP-enabled  products  ship  with  default community strings of
   "public"  for read-only access and "private" for read-write access. As
   with   any   known  default  access  control  mechanism,  the  CERT/CC
   recommends  that network administrators change these community strings
   to  something  of  their  own  choosing.  However, even when community
   strings  are changed from their defaults, they will still be passed in
   plaintext and are therefore subject to packet sniffing attacks. SNMPv3
   offers additional capabilities to ensure authentication and privacy as
   described in RFC2574.

   Because  many of the vulnerabilities identified in this advisory occur
   before  the  community  strings are evaluated, it is important to note
   that  performing  this  step  alone  is not sufficient to mitigate the
   impact  of  these vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, it should be performed
   as part of good security practice.

Segregate SNMP traffic onto a separate management network

   In  situations  where  blocking  or  disabling  SNMP  is not possible,
   exposure  to  these  vulnerabilities may be limited by restricting all
   SNMP  access  to  separate,  isolated management networks that are not
   publicly  accessible.  Although  this would ideally involve physically
   separate networks, that kind of separation is probably not feasible in
   most environments. Mechanisms such as virtual LANs (VLANs) may be used
   to  help  segregate  traffic  on  the same physical network. Note that
   VLANs  may  not  strictly  prevent  an  attacker from exploiting these
   vulnerabilities,  but  they may make it more difficult to initiate the
   attacks.

   Another  option  is  for  sites  to  restrict SNMP traffic to separate
   virtual private networks (VPNs), which employ cryptographically strong
   authentication.

   Note  that  these  solutions may require extensive changes to a site's
   network architecture.

Egress filtering

   Egress  filtering  manages  the flow of traffic as it leaves a network
   under your administrative control. There is typically limited need for
   machines providing public services to initiate outbound traffic to the
   Internet.  In  the  case  of  SNMP  vulnerabilities,  employing egress
   filtering on the ports listed above at your network border can prevent
   your network from being used as a source for attacks on other sites.

Disable stack execution

   Disabling  executable  stacks  (on systems where this is configurable)
   can  reduce  the  risk  of  "stack  smashing"  attacks  based on these
   vulnerabilities. Although this does not provide 100 percent protection
   against exploitation of these vulnerabilities, it makes the likelihood
   of a successful exploit much smaller. On many UNIX systems, executable
   stacks can be disabled by adding the following lines to /etc/system:

   set noexec_user_stack = 1 set noexec_user_stack_log = 1

   Note  that  this  may  go  against the SPARC and Intel ABIs and can be
   bypassed  as required in programs with mprotect(2). For the changes to
   take effect you will then need to reboot.

   Other  operating  systems and architectures also support the disabling
   of executable stacks either through native configuration parameters or
   via  third-party  software.  Consult  your  vendor(s)  for  additional
   information.

Share tools and techniques

   Because  dealing with these vulnerabilities to systems and networks is
   so  complex, the CERT/CC will provide a forum where administrators can
   share  ideas  and  techniques  that  can  be  used  to  develop proper
   defenses.  We  have created an unmoderated mailing list for system and
   network administrators to discuss helpful techniques and tools.

   You  can  subscribe to the mailing list by sending an email message to
   majordomo@cert.org. In the body of the message, type

   subscribe snmp-forum

   After you receive the confirmation message, follow the instructions in
   the message to complete the subscription process.

EnGarde Secure Linux

     EnGarde  Secure  Linux  did  not  ship any SNMP packages in version
     1.0.1 of our distribution, so we are not vulnerable to either bug.

FreeBSD

     FreeBSD  does  not  include any SNMP software by default, and so is
     not vulnerable.  However, the FreeBSD Ports Collection contains the
     UCD-SNMP   /   NET-SNMP   package.    Package   versions  prior  to
     ucd-snmp-4.2.3  are  vulnerable.   The upcoming FreeBSD 4.5 release
     will  ship  the  corrected  version  of  the  UCD-SNMP  /  NET-SNMP
     package.   In  addition,  the  corrected version of the packages is
     available from the FreeBSD mirrors.

     FreeBSD   has   issued  the  following  FreeBSD  Security  Advisory

     addressing the SNMP vulnerabilities.

IBM Corporation

     Based  upon  the  results  of  running  the  test  suites  we  have
     determined  that  our  version  of  SNMP  shipped  with  AIX is NOT
     vulnerable.

Innerdive Solutions, LLC

     Innerdive Solutions, LLC has two SNMP based products:
     1. The "SNMP MIB Scout"
     (http://www.innerdive.com/products/mibscout/)
     2. The "Router IP Console" (http://www.innerdive.com/products/ric/)
     The "SNMP MIB Scout" is not vulnerable to either bug.
     The "Router IP Console" releases prior to 3.3.0.407 are vulnerable.
     The release of "Router IP Console" correcting the behavior outlined
     in  OUSPG#0100  is  3.3.0.407 and is already available on our site.
     Also,  we  will  notify all our customers about this new release no
     later than March 5, 2002.

Juniper Networks

     This  is  in reference to your notification regarding CAN-2002-0012
     and  CAN-2002-0013.   Juniper Networks has reproduced this behavior
     and coded a software fix.  The fix will be included in all releases
     of  JUNOS Internet software built after January 5, 2002.  Customers
     with  current  support contracts can download new software with the
     fix from Juniper's web site at www.juniper.net.
     Note: The behavior described in CAN-2002-0012 and CAN-2002-0013 can
     only  be  reproduced  in JUNOS Internet software if certain tracing
     options  are  enabled.   These options are generally not enabled in
     production routers.

Lantronix, Inc.

     Lantronix  is  committed  to  resolving  security  issues  with our
     products.  The SNMP security bug you reported has been fixed in LRS

Lotus Development Corporation

     Lotus    Software   evaluated   the   Lotus   Domino   Server   for
     vulnerabilities using the test suite materials provided by OUSPG.
     This  problem  does  not affect default installations of the Domino
     Server.   However,  SNMP  agents  can  be  installed from the CD to
     provide  SNMP  services for the Domino Server (these are located in
     the   /apps/sysmgmt/agents   directory).    The  optional  platform
     specific  master  and  encapsulator  agents included with the Lotus
     Domino  SNMP  Agents  for  HP-UX  and Solaris have been found to be
     vulnerable.  For  those  platforms,  customers  should  upgrade  to
     version  R5.0.1  a  of  the Lotus Domino SNMP Agents, available for
     download  from the Lotus Knowledge Base on the IBM Support Web Site
     (http://www.ibm.com/software/lotus/support/).   Please   refer   to
     Document  #191059,  "Lotus Domino SNMP Agents R5.0.1a", also in the
     Lotus Knowledge Base, for more details.

LOGEC Systems Inc

     The  products  from  LOGEC  Systems are exposed to SNMP only via HP
     OpenView.  We  do  not have an implementation of SNMP ourselves. As
     such,  there is nothing in our products that would be an issue with
     this alert.

Lucent

     Lucent is aware of reports that there is a vulnerability in certain
     implementations  of  the  SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)
     code  that  is  used in data switches and other hardware throughout
     the telecom industry.
     As soon as we were notified by CERT, we began assessing our product
     portfolio  and  notifying  customers  with  products  that might be
     affected.
     Our  5ESS  switch  and  most  of  our  optical  portfolio  were not
     affected.   Our  core  and  edge  ATM switches and most of our edge
     access  products  are  affected, but we have developed, tested, and
     deployed  fixes for many of those products to our customers.  Fixes
     for  the  rest  of the affected product portfolio will be available
     shortly.
     We consider the security and reliability of our customers' networks
     to  be  one  of  our  critical  measures  of success. We take every
     reasonable measure to ensure their satisfaction.
     In  addition,  we  are  working  with  customers on ways to further
     enhance the security they have in place today.

Marconi

     Marconi  supplies  a  broad range of telecommunications and related
     products,  some  of  which are affected by the SNMP vulnerabilities
     identified  here.  The  manner  in  which they are affected and the
     actions  required  (if any) to avoid being impacted by exploitation
     of  these  vulnerabilities,  vary  from  product  to product. Those
     Marconi   customers   with  support  entitlement  may  contact  the
     appropriate   Technical  Assistance  Center  (TAC)  for  additional
     information.  Those not under support entitlement may contact their
     sales representative.

Microsoft Corporation

     The  Microsoft  Security Reponse [sic] Center has investigated this
     issue, and provides the following information.

     Summary:
     All  Microsoft  implementations  of  SNMP  v1  are  affected by the
     vulnerability.  The  SNMP v1 service is not installed or running by
     default on any version of Windows. A patch is underway to eliminate
     the  vulnerability.  In  the  meantime,  we recommend that affected
     customers disable the SNMP v1 service.

     Details:
     An  SNMP  v1 service ships on the CDs for Windows 95, 98, and 98SE.
     It  is  not  installed  or  running  by  default  on  any  of these
     platforms.  An SNMP v1 is NOT provided for Windows ME.  However, it
     is  possible  that  Windows  98  machines  which  had  the  service
     installed  and  were  upgraded would still have the service.  Since
     SNMP  is  not  supported for WinME, customers in this situation are
     urged to remove the SNMP service.
     An  SNMP  v1  service  is  available  on  Windows NT 4.0 (including
     Terminal  Server  Edition) and Windows 2000 but is not installed or
     running  by  default  on any of these platforms.Windows XP does not
     ship with an SNMP v1 service.

     Remediation:
     A  patch  is  underway  for  the  affected  platforms,  and will be
     released  shortly.  In  the  meantime,  Microsoft  recommends  that
     customers  who  have  the  SNMP  v1  service  running disable it to
     protect their systems. Following are instruction for doing this:

     Windows 95, 98 and 98SE:
     1. In Control Panel, double-click Network.
     2. On  the  Configuration  tab,  select Microsoft SNMP Agent from the
        list of installed components.
     3. Click Remove

     Check the following keys and confirm that snmp.exe is not listed.
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunSer
     vices
     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
 
     For Windows XP:
     1. Right-click on My Computer and select Manage
     2. Click on Services and Applications, then on Services
     3. Location  SNMP  on  the list of services, then select it and click
        Stop.
     4. Select Startup, and click Disabled.
     5. Click  OK  to  close  the  dialoge  [sic], then close the Computer
        Management window.
   
     For Windows NT 4.0 (including Terminal Server Edition):
     1. Select Start, then Settings.
     2. Select Control Panel, then click on the Services Icon
     3. Locate  SNMP  on  the  list  of services, then select it and click
        Stop.
     4. Select Startup, and click Disabled.
     5. Click OK to close the dialoge [sic], then close Control Panel

     Windows 2000:
     1. Right-click on My Computer and select Manage
     2. Click on Services and Applications, then on Services
     3. Location  SNMP  on  the list of services, then select it and click

     4. Select Startup, and click Disabled.
     5. Click  OK  to  close  the  dialoge  [sic], then close the Computer
        Management window.

Multinet

     MultiNet  and  TCPware customers should contact Process Software to
     check  for  the availability of patches for this issue. A couple of
     minor  problems were found and fixed, but there is no security risk
     related to the SNMP code included with either product.

Netaphor

     NETAPHOR  SOFTWARE INC. is the creator of Cyberons for Java -- SNMP
     Manager  Toolkit  and Cyberons for Java -- NMS Application Toolkit,
     two   Java  based  products  that  may  be  affected  by  the  SNMP
     vulnerabilities  identified  here.  The  manner  in  which they are
     affected  and the actions required (if any) to avoid being impacted
     by  exploitation  of  these  vulnerabilities,  may  be  obtained by
     contacting  Netaphor  via email at info@netaphor.com Customers with

     under    support    entitlement   may   contact   Netaphor   sales:
     sales@netaphor.com or (949) 470 7955 in USA.

NetBSD

     NetBSD does not ship with any SNMP tools in our 'base' releases. We
     do  provide  optional  packages  which  provide various support for
     SNMP.  These  packages  are  not installed by default, nor are they
     currently  provided  as  an  install option by the operating system
     installation tools. A system administrator/end-user has to manually
     install this with our package management tools. These SNMP packages
     include:
          + netsaint-plugin-snmp-1.2.8.4  (SNMP  monitoring  plug-in  for
            netsaint)
          + p5-Net-SNMP-3.60 (perl5 module for SNMP queries)
          + p5-SNMP-3.1.0  (Perl5  module for interfacing to the UCD SNMP
            library
          + p5-SNMP_Session-0.83   (perl5  module  providing  rudimentary
            access to remote SNMP agents)
          + ucd-snmp-4.2.1  (Extensible  SNMP  implementation) (conflicts
            with ucd-snmp-4.1.2)
          + ucd-snmp-4.1.2  (Extensible  SNMP  implementation) (conflicts
            with ucd-snmp-4.2.1)

     We    do   provide   a   software   monitoring   mechanism   called
     'audit-packages',  which allows us to highlight if a package with a
     range  of  versions  has  a potential vulnerability, and recommends
     that the end-user upgrade the packages in question.

Netscape Communications Corporation

     Netscape  continues  to be committed to maintaining a high level of
     quality  in  our  software  and  service  offerings.  Part  of this
     commitment  includes  prompt response to security issues discovered
     by organizations such as the CERT Coordination Center.
     According  to a recent CERT/CC advisory, The Oulu University Secure
     Programming  Group (OUSPG) has reported numerous vulnerabilities in
     multiple  vendor  SNMPv1 implementations. These vulnerabilities may
     allow unauthorized privileged access, denial of service attacks, or
     unstable behavior.
     We  have  carefully  examined the reported findings, performing the
     tests  suggested  by the OUSPG to determine whether Netscape server
     products  were  subject to these vulnerabilities. It was determined
     that several products fell into this category. As a result, we have
     created  fixes  which will resolve the issues, and these fixes will
     appear  in  future  releases  of  our  product  line. To Netscape's
     knowledge,  there  are  no known instances of these vulnerabilities
     being exploited and no customers have been affected to date.
     When such security warnings are issued, Netscape has committed to -
     and will continue to commit to - resolving these issues in a prompt
     and timely fashion, ensuring that our customers receive products of
     the highest quality and security.

NET-SNMP

     All  ucd-snmp  version  prior  to  4.2.2  are  susceptible  to this
     vulnerability  and  users  of  versions  prior to version 4.2.2 are
     encouraged   to   upgrade   their  software  as  soon  as  possible
     (http://www.net-snmp.org/download/).  Version  4.2.2 and higher are
     not susceptible.

Nokia

     This  vulnerability  is  known  to affect IPSO versions 3.1.3, 3.3,
     3.3.1,  3.4,  and  3.4.1.   Patches  are  currently  available  for
     versions  3.3,  3.3.1,  3.4  and  3.4.1 for download from the Nokia
     website.   In  addition,  version  3.4.2  shipped  with  the  patch
     incorporated,  and the necessary fix will be included in all future
     releases of IPSO.
     We  recommend customers install the patch immediately or follow the
     recommended precautions below to avoid any potential exploit.
     If you are not using SNMP services, including Traps, simply disable
     the   SNMP   daemon   to   completely   eliminate   the   potential
     vulnerability.
     If   you  are  using  only  SNMP  Traps  and  running  Check  Point
     FireWall-1,  create  a  firewall  policy  to disallow incoming SNMP
     messages on all appropriate interfaces. Traps will continue to work
     normally.

Appendix C. - Background Information

     Background Information on the OUSPG

       OUSPG  is an academic research group located at Oulu University in
       Finland.  The  purpose  of this research group is to test software
       for vulnerabilities.
       History  has  shown  that  the  techniques  used by the OUSPG have
       discovered a large number of previously undetected problems in the
       products  and  protocols  they  have  tested.  In  2001, the OUSPG
       produced a comprehensive test suite for evaluating implementations
       of  the  Lightweight  Directory  Access Protocol (LDAP). This test
       suite  was  developed with the strategy of abusing the protocol in
       unsupported  and  unexpected  ways,  and  it was very effective in
       uncovering  a  wide  variety  of  vulnerabilities  across  several
       products.  This approach can reveal vulnerabilities that would not
       manifest themselves under normal conditions.
       After  completing  its  work  on  LDAP,  OUSPG  moved its focus to
       SNMPv1.  As  with  LDAP,  they designed a custom test suite, began
       testing   a   selection   of  products,  and  found  a  number  of
       vulnerabilities.  Because  OUSPG's  work  on  LDAP  was similar in
       procedure  to its current work on SNMP, you may wish to review the
       LDAP  Test  Suite  and  CERT  Advisory  CA-2001-18, which outlined
       results of application of the test suite.
       In order to test the security of protocols like SNMPv1, the PROTOS
       project  presents  a  server with a wide variety of sample packets
       containing  unexpected  values  or  illegally formatted data. As a
       member of the PROTOS project consortium, the OUSPG used the PROTOS
       c06-snmpv1  test  suite  to  study  several implementations of the
       SNMPv1  protocol.  Results  of  the  test  suites run against SNMP
       indicate  that  there  are  many different vulnerabilities on many
       different implementations of SNMP.

     Background Information on the Simple Network Management Protocol
     
       The  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is the most popular
       protocol  in use to manage networked devices. SNMP was designed in
       the late 80's to facilitate the exchange of management information
       between  networked  devices, operating at the application layer of
       the  ISO/OSI  model.  The SNMP protocol enables network and system
       administrators  to  remotely  monitor and configure devices on the
       network  (devices  such  as  switches  and  routers). Software and
       firmware products designed for networks often make use of the SNMP
       protocol.  SNMP  runs  on  a  multitude  of  devices and operating
       systems, including, but not limited to,
          + Core  Network  Devices (Routers, Switches, Hubs, Bridges, and
            Wireless Network Access Points)
          + Operating Systems
          + Consumer  Broadband  Network  Devices  (Cable  Modems and DSL
            Modems)
          + Consumer Electronic Devices (Cameras and Image Scanners)
          + Networked   Office  Equipment  (Printers,  Copiers,  and  FAX
            Machines)
          + Network and Systems Management/Diagnostic Frameworks (Network
            Sniffers and Network Analyzers)
          + Uninterruptible Power Supplies (UPS)
          + Networked Medical Equipment (Imaging Units and Oscilloscopes)
          + Manufacturing and Processing Equipment
       The  SNMP  protocol  is  formally defined in RFC1157. Quoting from
       that RFC:

                Implicit  in the SNMP architectural model is a collection
                of  network  management  stations  and  network elements.
                Network    management    stations    execute   management
                applications  which monitor and control network elements.
                Network  elements  are  devices  such as hosts, gateways,
                terminal  servers,  and  the  like, which have management
                agents  responsible for performing the network management
                functions  requested  by the network management stations.
                The  Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to
                communicate  management  information  between the network
                management   stations  and  the  agents  in  the  network
                elements.

       Additionally,   SNMP  is  discussed  in  a  number  of  other  RFC
       documents:
          + RFC 3000 Internet Official Protocol Standards
          + RFC 1212 Concise MIB Definitions
          + RFC  1213  Management Information Base for Network Management
            of TCP/IP-based Internets: MIB-II
          + RFC  1215  A  Convention  for Defining Traps for use with the
            SNMP
          + RFC 1270 SNMP Communications Services
          + RFC  2570  Introduction to Version 3 of the Internet-standard
            Network Management Framework
          + RFC  2571  An  Architecture  for  Describing  SNMP Management
            Frameworks
          + RFC  2572  Message  Processing and Dispatching for the Simple
            Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
          + RFC 2573 SNMP Applications
          + RFC 2574 User-based Security Model (USM) for version 3 of the
            Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMPv3)
          + RFC  2575  View-based  Access  Control  Model  (VACM) for the
            Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)
          + RFC  2576  Coexistence  between  Version  1,  Version  2, and
            Version   3   of  the  Internet-standard  Network  Management
            Framework
