Ramon,

The simple answer is that it can't be done without the camera parameters. We
ran into the same issue with those air photos over the LY4 trench site. The
unpleasant solution is to use point to point rectification with a
georeferenced topo map.

The complex answer is that it depends on:
-how much experience the person has with aerial photography (can they
recognize a Wild from a Zeiss, Fairchild, or Leica, to help make educated
guesses?)
-the photos themselves (do they have fiducial marks, bubble levels, date
stamps, border patterns, any printed info? if so, can be used to pin down at
least the make if not the model)
-how many photos are involved (if only 3, is it worth the hassle?)
-what resolution is needed (brute rectification can be perfectly adequate)
-the history of the air photos (where are they from? is there a paper
trail? if a city, state, or national agency, they could have the summary
report with the camera parameters or have records of the contractor who can
then be contacted for the camera parameters; if a rural unpopulated area,
there may be only one or two aerial photo contractors who hopefully have
records)
-helpfulness of others (Landiscor, a private aerial photography company, was
extremely helpful in helping me hunt down information on some Union Hills
photos I had from the state survey)

Even after all that, you will need ALL the camera parameters. In my limited
experience, you will never be able to guess. If you make incremental changes
in one variable, you will not see incremental improvements in the image. All
that said, I have not personally used Orthomax in over a year and a half, and
perhaps they have a better system in place, but this is what I know about it.

I hope that helps.
Steve
