The Civilizing Effect
Of Market Economics
THE MARKETPLACE allocates resources efficiently and unsentimentally, =
pausing to contemplate neither fairness nor feelings. So one might =
expect people in societies that embrace money and the market to be =
richer, but less generous and altruistic, than small bands who hunt and =
farm communally in isolated parts of the Amazon or Africa.

But is that reality? American generosity after Sept. 11 doesn't suggest =
hard-heartedness. What if we randomly picked pairs of people from the =
same community and did an experiment? Tell neither the other's identity. =
Offer Player One $100, and test his generosity by telling him to split =
the money any way he chooses with Player Two, who knows how big the =
stakes are. Add one catch to restrain Player One from being selfish: If =
Player Two refuses the offer, neither gets anything.

A coldly rational person -- think bond traders -- would offer as little =
as possible, maybe $10. And if Player Two were coldly rational, he would =
accept; after all, $10 is better than no dollars. But such people exist =
only in economists' minds.

In repeated experiments of this sort, people cast as Player One were =
more generous than the calculating bond trader. And people cast as =
Player Two were more likely to reject small offers, even though that =
left them with nothing. This left economists scratching their heads and =
wondering why we don't act as their theories say we should.

Along the way, they wondered what sorts of people act more generously: =
Nomadic Hazda hunter-gatherers who forage in Tanzania? Or farmers in =
Hamilton, Mo., in the heart of our market-oriented society?

Americans, it turns out. Hazda cast as Player One offered the equivalent =
of $33 on average. Hamiltonians in the same role offered $48. =
Anthropologists didn't use the same sums in both places, of course. The =
stakes were roughly a day's pay in each.

THE PATTERN across societies where experiments were conducted is =
counterintuitive, but consistent. The more involved people are in market =
activities -- such as working for wages or buying and selling goods to =
others -- the more generous they are. "The most altruistic and trusting =
societies are those that are the most market-oriented," says Jean =
Ensminger, an anthropologist at the California Institute of Technology, =
Pasadena.

Experiments aren't precise substitutes for real life. But by doing =
enough experiments, using substantial stakes and sifting results =
statistically, researchers are uncovering ways in which people tend to =
behave differently depending on where they grow up.

At first, the researchers experimented with college students in =
Indonesia, Japan, Slovenia and the U.S. They found few differences. That =
simply proved that college students tend to be alike no matter where =
they're from.

Then a young anthropologist named Joseph Henrich, who was doing =
unrelated fieldwork in the Peruvian Amazon, found that these games could =
be played with unsophisticated people. His work offered early evidence =
that people in primitive societies might be less generous with one =
another than we are.

Intrigued foundations dispatched a dozen anthropologists to play this =
and other games with 15 communities from the Orma in East Africa, who =
often trade cattle and work for wages, to the Quichua in Ecuador, who =
don't. The games also were played in rural Hamilton and urban St. Louis.

EXPERIMENTS DON'T REVEAL why market-oriented people like the Orma make =
more-generous offers ($44 on average) than subsistence, slash-and-burn =
farmers like the Quichua ($25). Nor do they explain why Americans and =
others in market-oriented settings come much closer to offering partners =
a 50-50 split than other people do. But the games do suggest something =
profound about the way markets shape human behavior and relationships.

"Many people thought markets would make people selfish and amoral. That =
view is at least too simple, if not just plain wrong," says Samuel =
Bowles, an economist at the University of Massachusetts and the Santa Fe =
Institute.

Maybe, suggests Ms. Ensminger, altruism is a luxury that only developed =
societies can afford. Or maybe market societies grow accustomed to =
conventions, like splitting windfalls 50-50. Or maybe, as she and other =
researchers suspect, markets do change the way people behave, but not in =
the way we often think.

"Markets teach us to behave decently to strangers," Mr. Bowles =
speculates. "Markets are an arena in which you encounter somebody you've =
never seen before and engage in mutually beneficial activity." In a =
society without markets, people deal mainly with familiar faces. They =
have little practice in one-time transactions with anonymous strangers.

People overlook "assumptions about trust that are built into the market =
economy," adds Mr. Henrich, who will join Emory University's faculty =
this year. "When you take a taxi, you could walk out without paying the =
fare," he says. "But people generally don't." The same goes for tipping =
in restaurants.

Sure, some Americans stiff cab drivers and waiters. But not very many. =
And that offers a heartening counterpoint at a moment when Enron exposes =
the excesses and greed of a market society.
