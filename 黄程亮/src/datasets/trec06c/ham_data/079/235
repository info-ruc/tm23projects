Mac OS 9 has been a godsend for me 'cause it finally gets the Mac past
its limit of 348 open files---do you run with virtual memory? If not,
turn that on. Extensions? Turn off anything you can do without. Mac OS 9
isn't all that great, but at least it's better than Mac OS 8.6-- for
doing work involving large amounts of support files. (IME for any but
the simplest of projects, Mac OS 8 runs out of file handles just 'bout
when I'm getting going doing work).

ATM 4.6.2 updater can be d/l'd by going to www.adobe.com, clicking on
``Support'', ``Select a Product'', ``Type Manager Deluxe'', ``ATM Deluxe
for Mac OS'' hmm.... belay that last. All that's there is 4.6.1---guess
4.6.2 must've gotten pulled.

Ask Adobe 'bout it. My copy of the installer is dated 5 June 2001. I'm
irritated at Adobe, so if they won't come through, let me know and I'll
post a copy for you to d/l. 4.6.1 worked okay for me too though, so I
suspect it's a corrupted preference file, or something endemic to your
Mac's setup---have you tried all the standard Mac troubleshooting
voodoo?

Does

Yes---how could anyone work without that?

The font as rasterized by the scaler---I think you can get around it by
making bitmap fonts for _every_ size you use and setting ATM to favor
them, but haven't bothered to experiment, just always trash the Apple
scaler.

I know it's bad of me, but I'm looking forward to the howls of anguish
when Quark 5 comes out, and pages are different depending upon whether
the app opens them in Classic or Carbon. I loathe Quark.

It's just ``f'' and ``i'' set together, so no real need for it---my
point is it's in there and it's munged.
