Berthold, I've had enough of trying to deal with your dreadful formatting.
I give up.  I'm afraid list readers will have to figure out the quoting
themselves because I'm sick and tired of having to work to get round your
antisocial email habits.  Why don't you just tell your email program to
stop sending html to the tex-fonts list?

Completely poppycock.  It's quite irrelevant where the TeX system is ported
*from*, as you know; nor does it matter whether it's system support for
scalable or fixed sized founts that is being used.  Of course.

I suggest that you try *using* a Macintosh implementation of TeX some day.
OzTeX certainly makes use of system support for scalable and fixed founts,
and I'm pretty sure that CMacTeX does too (although I've not investigated
its dvi driver in detail and can't be bothered now).  I'd be astonished if
Textures didn't use MacOS fount drawing stuff.

Rowland.
