Dear Lesson Study Community,

We are pleased to announce a new collaboration between the Lesson
Study Research Group and the School Renewal Web Center, which
currently hosts a discussion forum on lesson study.  This discussion
forum provides individuals who are interested or engaged in lesson
study with the opportunity to conduct online conversations.  It can
be used to pose questions, raise issues, and share insights about
lesson study-related topics.

We would like to announce that for the next two weeks, from February
19-March 5, we have invited the following individuals to respond to any
questions or issues about implementing lesson study.  These "hosts" will
regularly log in to the discussion forum to respond to any questions, engage
in a dialogue with each other, and discuss issues with other members of the
lesson study community:

***BILL JACKSON, Teacher/ Math Specialist at Public School #2, Paterson,
NJ--one of the first teachers in the U.S. to implement study lessons, and
who is currently working closely with Japanese colleagues to continue
refining lesson study.

***JAN GABAY, English Teacher/Staff Developer at The Preuss School,
UCSD--developed and is leading the whole school faculty (middle and high)
through a lesson study process. (Videos of Jan can be see on the School
Renewal WebCenter feature on Lesson Study.)

***Dr. LYNN LIPTAK, Principal of Public School #2, Paterson, NJ--one of the
first principals/ administrators to implement lesson study in a U.S. school;

***CLEA FERNANDEZ, Assistant Professor and Director of the Lesson Study
Research Group, Teachers College/ Columbia University;

We are thankful to them for helping launch these "hosted" discussions, and
would like to continue this series by announcing other hosts and specific
topics in the near future.   Please let us know if you have any suggestions
for topics and/ or hosts, and please feel free to actively participate in
this discussion forum at any time.

Instructions for using the discussion forum (and listserv) are available at:
