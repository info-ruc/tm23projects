Review of : "Bayeux: an architecture for scalable and Fault-tolerant
wide-area data dissemination," by S.ZQ.Zhuang et al

Panagiotis Papadimtratos papadp@ece.cornell.edu

Bayeux extends Tapestry by providing a multicast delivery protocol at the
application level as well. The oblect location infrastructure provided by
Tapestry lets bayeux naturally built logical trees rooted at the network
location that stores data and wishes to initiate a multicast session. The
fault-tolerance properties provided by Tapesty are enhanced here, at the
expense of transmission overhead with packet duplication. Moreover, Bayeux
partitions the logical trees so that it reduces the processing overhead of
the root nodes.

In particular, the multicast operation is facilitated by the route
aggregation, which practically keeps the tree fanout low, i.e., equal to
the name/address base. Moreover, delivery to multiple tree nodes does not
imply that a packet has to be duplicated: it is sufficient to send one
replica per address prefix. Also, the tree depth depends on the size of
the name space.  The root node advertises the session (i.e., the file id)
which is stored at intermediate nodes, as described in Tapestry.

As nodes join/leave the session, which is source- and data- specific, the
requests propagate to the root of the tree. In order to balance this load,
the authors propose to partition not only the trees but also oranize the
nodes so that the access different trees according to the network
proximity. The issue of network proximity in the light of the
location-independent addressing schemes is recurring in the relevant
literature, and sounds contradictory for schemes to backtrack to the ideas
of an architecture that they had a priori rejected for their purposes.
