   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running Oracle8i Database
     * Systems running Oracle9i Database
     * Systems running Oracle9i Application Server

Overview

   Multiple  vulnerabilities  in  Oracle Application Server have recently
   been  discovered.  These  vulnerabilities  include  buffer  overflows,
   insecure  default  settings,  failures to enforce access controls, and
   failure  to  validate  input.  The  impacts  of  these vulnerabilities
   include  the  execution  of  arbitrary  commands  or  code,  denial of
   service, and unauthorized access to sensitive information.

I. Description

   Oracle  Application  Server  includes a web server based on the Apache
   HTTP  Server. Oracle extends the web server with a number of different
   components   that   can   be   used  provide  interfaces  to  database
   applications.  These  components  include,  but  are not limited to, a
   Procedural  Language/Structured  Query  Language (PL/SQL) module, Java
   Server  Pages, XSQL Servlets, and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
   applications.

   The  vulnerabilities  referenced  in  this  advisory  were reported in
   several publications by David Litchfield of NGSSoftware:

   For  the  complete list of Oracle-related vulnerabilities published by
   the  CERT/CC, please search the Vulnerability Notes Database using the
   term  'Oracle'.  Details  about specific vulnerabilies can be found in
   the appropriate vulnerability note.

   Oracle   has   addressed   these   vulnerabilities  with  patches  and
   recommended configuration changes. For more information please see the
   vendor information for Oracle in Appendix A.

  Buffer overflows

   Several  buffer-overflow  vulnerabilities  exist in the way the PL/SQL
   module  handles  HTTP  requests  and configuration parameters. Default
   configuration  settings  in  a  range  of components are insecure, and
   different  components  fail  to  apply  access restrictions uniformly.
   These   vulnerabilities   expose   both  the  systems  running  Oracle
   Application   Server  and  the  information  held  in  the  underlying
   databases to undue risk.

   Two  more buffer overflow vulnerabilities exist in code that processes
   configuration  parameters.  These  parameters  processes configuration
   parameters   that   can  be  specified  via  the  PL/SQL  gateway  web
   administration interface. By default, access to the PL/SQL gateway web
   administration interface is not restricted [VU#611776].

   VU#500203   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via help page request

   VU#313280   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via HTTP Location header

   VU#750299   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via HTTP request

   VU#878603   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via HTTP Authorization header

   VU#659043   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via Database Access Descriptor password

   VU#923395   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via cache directory name

  Insecure default configurations

   The  default  installation  of  Oracle  Application  Server includes a
   number  of insecure configuration settings, such as well-known default
   passwords  and  unrestricted  access  to  applications  and  sensitive
   information.

   VU#307835  -  Oracle9i  Application  Server OWA_UTIL procedures expose
   sensitive information

   VU#736923  -  Oracle  9iAS  SOAP  components  allow anonymous users to
   deploy applications by default

   VU#611776   -   Oracle9i   Application   Server   PL/SQL  Gateway  web
   administration interface uses null authentication by default

   VU#698467  -  Oracle  9iAS  default  configuration  allows  access  to
   "globals.jsa" file

   VU#476619  -  Oracle 9iAS default configuration allows arbitrary users
   to view sensitive configuration files

   VU#712723  - Oracle 9iAS default configuration uses well-known default
   passwords

   VU#168795  -  Oracle  9iAS  allows  anonymous  remote  users  to  view
   sensitive Apache services by default

   VU#278971  -  Oracle  9i Application Server does not adequately handle
   requests  for nonexistent JSP files thereby disclosing web folder path
   information

  Failure to enforce access controls

   Oracle   Application   Server   does   not  uniformly  enforce  access
   restrictions.   Different   components   do   not   adequately   check
   authorization before granting access to protected resources.

   VU#180147  -  Oracle  9i  Database  Server PL/SQL module allows remote
   command execution without authentication

   VU#193523 - Oracle 9i Application Server allows unauthenticated access
   to PL/SQL applications via alternate Database Access Descriptor

   VU#977251 - Oracle 9iAS XSQL Servlet ignores file permissions allowing
   arbitrary users to view sensitive configuration files

   VU#547459  -  Oracle  9iAS creates temporary files when processing JSP
   requests that are world-readable

  Failure to validate input

   In  one  case,  the PL/SQL module does not properly handle a malformed
   HTTP request.

   VU#805915  - Oracle9i Application Server Apache PL/SQL module does not
   properly handle HTTP Authorization header

II. Impact

   The  impacts  of these vulnerabilities include the remote execution of
   arbitrary   code,  remote  execution  of  commands  and  SQL  queries,
   disclosure of sensitive information, and denial of service.

  Remote execution of arbitrary commands and code

   This section contains vulnerabilities that permit a remote intruder to
   cause  a  denial  of  service  or execute arbitrary commands, code, or
   queries on the system.

   Some  of  these vulnerabilities allow execution with the privileges of
   the Apache process. On UNIX systems, the Apache process typically runs
   as the "oracle" user. On Windows systems, the Apache service typically
   runs  as  the  SYSTEM user; therefore, an attacker could gain complete
   control of the system by exploiting these vulnerabilities.

   VU#500203   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via help page request

   VU#313280   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via help page request Location: header

   VU#750299   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via HTTP request

   VU#878603   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable  to  buffer overflow via HTTP Authorization header password
   parameter

   VU#659043   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via Database Access Descriptor password

   VU#923395   -   Oracle9i   Application  Server  Apache  PL/SQL  module
   vulnerable to buffer overflow via cache directory name

   VU#180147  -  Oracle  9i  Database  Server PL/SQL module allows remote
   command execution without authentication

   VU#736923  -  Oracle  9iAS  SOAP  components  allow anonymous users to
   deploy applications by default

   VU#712723  - Oracle 9iAS default configuration uses well-known default
   passwords

   VU#611776   -   Oracle9i   Application   Server   PL/SQL  Gateway  web
   administration interface uses null authentication by default

  Unauthorized access to sensitive information

   A  number  of  vulnerabilities  disclose  configuration information or
   expose   data   stored   in   underlying   databases.  Also,  insecure
   applications  could  allow  an intruder to execute SQL queries. Oracle
   system  programmers  may  wish  to  examine  these  vulnerabilities in
   Oracle's  sample pages to prevent similar vulnerabilities in their own
   Oracle applications.

   VU#307835  -  Oracle9i  Application Server OWA_UTIL PL/SQL application
   exposes procedures that are remotely accessible by arbitrary users

   VU#193523 - Oracle 9i Application Server allows unauthenticated access
   to PL/SQL applications via alternate Database Access Descriptor

   VU#698467  -  Oracle  9iAS  default  configuration  allows  access  to
   "globals.jsa" file

   VU#476619  -  Oracle 9iAS default configuration allows arbitrary users
   to view sensitive configuration files

   VU#977251 - Oracle 9iAS XSQL Servlet ignores file permissions allowing
   arbitrary users to view sensitive configuration files

   VU#168795  -  Oracle  9iAS  allows  anonymous  remote  users  to  view
   sensitive Apache services by default

   VU#278971  -  Oracle  9i Application Server does not adequately handle
   requests  for nonexistent JSP files thereby disclosing web folder path
   information

   VU#547459  -  Oracle  9iAS creates temporary files when processing JSP
   requests that are world-readable

  Denial of service

   In  the  case where the PL/SQL module does not properly handle an HTTP
   request,   a   denial-of-service   vulnerability   exists.   Also,  an
   unsuccessful  attempt to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability could
   crash the Apache service.

   VU#805915  - Oracle9i Application Server Apache PL/SQL module does not
   properly handle HTTP Authorization header

III. Solution

   Oracle has provided patches and workarounds that address most of these
   vulnerabilities.  Sites using Oracle Application Server are encouraged
