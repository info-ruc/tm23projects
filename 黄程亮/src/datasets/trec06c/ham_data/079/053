Bayeux: An architecture for scalable and fault-tolerant wide are data
dissemincation.

	Bayeux is a tree based multicast protocol desgined for streaming
multimedia on top of tapestry routing protocol. Streaming multi-media
applications have the property of having several consumers of
information while a singe source.  This fits neatly on top of the
tapestry architecture since the source can be considered to be the root
server for the media-files and the consumers, the different client of
tapestry.  As shown in the paper it is quite trivial to establish a
logical tree of routing from source to multiple destinations based on
the tapestry architecture.  Such a tree would have a very short depth
(10 for 160-bit node ids) and a constant fan-out (16).  

	The quality of multi-media streams relies extremely upon a
metric called jitter - that measures the inter-arrival time between
succesive packets.  Since tapestry architecture has a constant
tree-rebuilding process in the background upon node and link failures,
it would be extremely difficult to guarantee low jitter. Further
tapestry assumes an underlying overlay network routing architecture
(internet) that does not guarantee any bound for the jitter.  These
restrictions may prove tapestry an unsuitable solution for the proposed
problem.

  	Bayeux proposes to overcome this problem partly by routing
duplicate packets through secondary neighbors in the routing tree.
While the paper claims that such duplicate paths taken would soon
converge (thus limiting the overhead) it is not clear why as contrary to
what is stated in the paper the multicast tree is rooted at the source
and not the destination.  In addition to that the tapestry routing
algorithm relies on timeouts when routing through secondary neighbors
and hence might increase the jitter quite high.  Further, bayeux
proposes to make nodes proximal in the physical topology also to be
proximal in the virtual topology. This might weaken the fault tolerance
and robustness gurantees of tapestry.
