Yes, strictly it is a bug, but it is a long-standing one and a
difficult one to fix satisfactorily. The effect is machine dependent
and usually manifests itself as an integer overflow or floating
overflow. For PGBOX to work successfully, the endpoints of the axis
must be representable withsufficient precision in normal float (not
double), and the ratio of either endpoint to the tick interval must
not be too large an integer.  There are some things I could do to
ameliorate the problem (e.g., changing the arguments of the relevant
routines to double would help in some cases, but this would require a
new API), but this would not be a full solution. In cases like this
you should subtract a large offset from your quantities before trying
to plot them.
