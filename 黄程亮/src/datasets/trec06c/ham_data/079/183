      Advisers' Union Drive Is Gaining on Campus
      By STEVEN GREENHOUSE
      MHERST, Mass., Feb. 20 =97 The next frontier in unionizing just =
may be the college residence hall, where stereos blare and students =
traipse to the showers clad only in towels.

      The resident advisers, or R.A.'s, at the University of =
Massachusetts here are not what one might think of as downtrodden =
workers; they mainly listen to freshmen talk about their problems and =
tell drunken students to keep the noise down.

      But saying that their work is low- paying, tiring and sometimes =
harrowing, the advisers here will vote next month on whether to unionize =
in a drive that labor leaders hope will serve as a model for thousands =
of resident advisers nationwide.

      The union idea has caught fire among the 365 resident advisers at =
UMass's Amherst campus. The university is fighting the idea, saying that =
resident advisers are students, not workers, and should not have the =
right to unionize.=20

      Many resident advisers see unionizing as a tool to get the =
university to listen to their complaints and to raise their wages. =
Advisers at UMass earn a $50 weekly stipend and a free dormitory room, =
valued at $3,286 per academic year.

      "A union can help us get an equal playing field with the =
university," said Jennifer Caires, a sophomore resident adviser who =
serves as counselor, role model and social director for the 44 students =
on the third floor of Wheeler Hall here. "Having a union will force the =
administration to listen to us."

      As the labor movement struggles to reverse its decades-long =
decline, unions have been searching for new types of workers to =
organize. Now the United Auto Workers finds itself seeking to unionize =
the resident advisers here after several advisers asked for help because =
they were impressed by how the U.A.W. had represented UMass's graduate =
teaching and research assistants.=20

      "The labor movement at its best has to follow where the activity =
is, and right now there is a lot of activity taking place at this campus =
and some other college campuses," said Tom Juravich, director of the =
Labor Studies Center at UMass. "At a time when many union members are =
nearing retirement, this is an extremely important effort because it's =
connecting the labor movement with young people."

      University officials ridicule the notion that undergraduate =
advisers should be allowed to unionize, asserting that being a resident =
adviser is a privilege, not a job.

      "Unionization of undergraduate students is inconsistent with =
education at UMass Amherst," the university's chancellor, Marcellette G. =
Williams, wrote in a letter to resident advisers urging them to vote =
against unionizing. "Unionization is particularly incompatible with your =
position as a student leader and role model in the residence halls."

      The university chooses resident advisers based on their grades and =
their leadership and communications skills. They help patrol the =
dormitories where 11,000 undergraduates live.

      University officials fear that bargaining with undergraduates will =
cause bitterness, although UMass need not fear a strike because state =
law bars walkouts by public employees. The university also warns that if =
it gives resident advisers a raise it might have to increase housing =
fees for all students.

      "One can make the argument that this is a job, but that's not our =
primary point of view," said Michael Gilbert, director of housing =
services at the Amherst campus. "We approach this from a very =
developmental and educational perspective. This is different from a =
student working off campus pumping gas."

      Last April, the United Auto Workers presented a petition in which =
three-fourths of the R.A.'s said they wanted the union to represent =
them. The university responded that it did not have to recognize the =
union because the advisers, which it calls resident assistants, were not =
workers. That left it up to the Massachusetts Labor Relations Commission =
to determine whether the resident advisers were workers.

      Chris Fierro, a senior who is a resident adviser, said, "It's a =
service rendered that I receive payment for =97 there is no simpler =
definition of a job. It's no different than if I work at Pizza Hut."

      The commission ruled last month that the resident advisers were =
indeed employees and scheduled a unionization election for March 5. It =
noted that the R.A.'s had signed an employment contract, averaged 20 =
hours' work each week and received W-2 forms and weekly paychecks.=20

      Ms. Caires, who hopes to major in finance, complained about many =
aspects of being a resident adviser: her fears of telling drunken, =
6-foot-2 football players to lower their stereos, the times she was =
awakened at 4 a.m. by students who locked themselves out of their rooms, =
the university's order that resident advisers remain in their =
dormitories during the Super Bowl this year to help prevent chaos, =
especially if the New England Patriots won.

      Some R.A.'s have had to deal with students who attempted suicide =
and visitors who took guns into a dormitory. Several said the worst part =
of the job was being on call all the time.=20

      "I support the union because I like my job and I want to improve =
it," said Cristal Cruz, a resident adviser majoring in journalism and =
women's studies.=20

      The resident advisers' system at UMass works on an almost =
industrial model with hundreds of advisers taking orders from a =
hierarchy of administrators. At Amherst College's more intimate campus =
across town, the resident advisers' system is more collegial, and there =
is no pressure to unionize.

      "We feel needed," said Justin Jagher, a junior at Amherst. "The =
college looks out for us. I'd call it more of an honor than a job."
