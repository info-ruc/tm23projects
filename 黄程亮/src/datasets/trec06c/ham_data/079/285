Dear Lesson Study Community,

I am currently working on a commissioned report for the NAS/ NRC Board of
International Comparative Studies in Education (BICSE), which explores the
impact of lesson study on the U.S. education community.   As part of this
report, I am compiling basic information about lesson study groups/
projects/ and other lesson-study related activities.  I have heard about
MANY lesson study groups out there that are not included in our National
Database of Lesson Study Groups:
www.tc.columbia.edu/lessonstudy/lsgroups.html.

Our organization, the Lesson Study Group of Teachers College/
Columbia University, maintains a national database of lesson study
groups for networking purposes.  If you would like to include your group in
this database, please respond to this e-mail immediately so that I can send
you a questionnaire.   Basic information about your group (such as grade
levels, content areas, location, etc.) and contact information will be
included on our website unless you indicate otherwise (and you will still be
included in our research database).

Thank you for your time!
