Sorry to disagree with your suggestion about cataloging my orchids, but you
can have my Paph species list when you pry it from my cold, dead hands!  I
have no way to prove that I found my Paph abcdefganum on a bench at the old
Beall's greenhouse on Vashon Island back in the 70's and that it was from a
selfing of a superb clone.  I cannot prove that I did not acquire an
illegal,  jungle-collected plant.  To paraphrase something I heard once -
just because I'm paranoid does not mean they are not after my species!

Gentle folk,   I want to thank all of the members of this list who responded
to my questions about Dend. speciosum.  Your answers were thoughtful and the
result or much experience.  The files are on one e-mail now (no
attachmnents!) and I would be pleased to forward the file to anyone who
sends me an address privately.

It is a pleaseure to be in touch with so many orchid folks and I am sure
that I speak for all the Members of the Orchid Society of the Royal

Assuming that the New York International Orchid Show will be at
Rockefeller Center, as Iris announced, please rest assured from someone
who commutes to that area weekly that there is more than ample parking
both in and around Rockefeller Center for everyone.  In fact, compared
to the Winter Garden venue, parking prospects are tripled.  Park before
11 am and play all day for $20, including tip.  Roger

Subject: [OGD] CITES - more then a trade treaty.

I'm sure everyone knows where I stand on the CITES controversy from my
previous posts. I only wish to interject one thought into this, much
more civil, discussion:
I think it is necessary to deal with reality or theorizing and
philosophizing will get one nowhere. Specifically, drawing a line
between CITES, saying it's only a trade regulation treaty, and the rules
and laws nations have adopted, blaming them for all the negative
aspects, is unrealistic. CITES is the causative agent. Whether or not it
is, whether or not it of necessity should be, these questions skirt the
facts. The plain and simple fact is that it is the cause of and reason
for all the other collateral regulations, laws, and restrictions, as
well as the destruction of orchids in situ (now and over the next
howevermany years as their habitats alter to the point of being
inhospitable to orchid life) because they can't be moved. I can
intellectually understand the difference but my studies in history and
politics also caution me to look at the real effects and ramifications
of events, ideas and laws- whether or not they make predetermined
'sense'. If 'A' in practice causes 'B', then you must accept that and
work from there if you wish to change or eliminate 'B', or you're just
tilting at windmills. People are the unpredictable variable here, and if
CITES causes them to behave in a certain way, then it =5Fis=5F  the cause.
Period. So please let's not have any more of this trying to break it
down into separate issues. There is in practice no separating them. It's
a false issue, and will solve nothing.

Subject: [OGD] Den. bigibbum / Den phalaenopsis question

I'm a student judge in the midst of preparing a presentation on how to judge
orchids of the Dendrobium bigibbum / phalaenopsis complex.  I'd greatly
appreciate hearing from anyone who is familiar with breeding trends and
standards of flower quality in this group.

Also, I am unable to locate the origin of  the species epithet 'bigibbum'.
Does it refer to the discoverer's name, or to floral anatomy?
(I finally learned how to pronounce bi-GIB-bum  correctly when I asked an
Aussie friend why he stifled a laugh whenever I would say the plant's name
:-)

You can contact me directly by e-mail at: cynthiahill@msn.com.
Thank you,
