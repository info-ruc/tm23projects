Oh. I forgot about that.

I tend to deal with plain TeX and LaTeX 2.09 by \inputting a separate
file to deal with encoding issues, e.g \input texnansi % for LY1.
That currently does not define the various quotes, even though it
defines other things like \S and \P, \trademark, \copyright etc.
So it wouldn't help with "ngerman".

Great! Thanks.
