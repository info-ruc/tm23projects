My name is Nick Timpone and I am a teacher in Paterson, New Jersey Public 
School #2. I am currently doing research for my masters thesis. I am 
investigting the effect of lesson study on student teachers and I am looking 
for a population to participate in my study. I am looking for schools that 
are practicing lesson study in mathematics and that will have a student 
teacher(s) involved in the process during the Spring 2002 semester.
Please reply to ntimpone@aol.com or phone me at 201-288-3464.
Thank-you
