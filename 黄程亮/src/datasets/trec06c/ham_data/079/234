4.6.2 *deluxe*?  I thought the last version of ATM deluxe was 4.6.1?

(4.6.1 causes widespread crashing havoc on my G4 under 9.1 or 9.2.2.  I
suppose I could mention that MacOS 9.0.4 and above have been the most
atrociously unrealiable OSes I've ever had the misfortune to use)

But you say it works fine: one problem I've met with ATM 4.6.1 is that it's
not possible to switch off `preserve line spacing' - the switch appears to
work in the control panel, but unruly descenders still get clipped.  Does
that work okay for you?

Oh dear...  Where do they get the metric data from in any case?

Not having MacOS X, I can't try that - but is that particular ligature in
Optima really worth the bother of designing it?  Or do I have a funny copy
of Optima?
