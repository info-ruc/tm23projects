Oh aye.

I've got *more* turned off than I can do without.  This flashy G4 Mac is a
serious pain in the arse to use compared to the 68LC040 it's sat next to -
but it is a touch quicker...

Yeah, but it's worse than 7.6.1 from the point of view of reliability,
efficiency, and user interface.

I suppose I'm fortunate that I don't do anything like that myself.

The statement I've read is that ATM Deluxe 4.6.1 is *it* for that line - no
further developments are being done, but ATM `straight' hasn't been dropped
from further development.

Yes.  And I have exactly the same problem under 9.0.4, 9.1, 9.2.1, and
9.2.2 (all always installed clean generating clean prefs for pretty much
everything and *certainly* ATM, which is installed afresh any time I do an
OS upgrade) running with either the original firmware or update 4.2.8.
Everything else you can think of has been done as well and if anyone so
much as *mentions* a PRAM zap again...

It's not my Mac's setup because I've changed that radically and in any case
anything which crops up after a disc format and re-install the OS from
clean and then add ATM only - well...

I couldn't...

What, so no kerning or anything like that?

What does that thing do?  I've not turned it off because I've not been able
to figure it out - the Extensions Mangler blurb is characteristically
unhelpful (what the hell is an ATSUI application and do I need to care? - I
suppose what I really want to know is how come Apple will tell developers
what they need to know to write programs and tell cheese-heads what they
need to know to stop worrying too much, but normal intelligent end users
like me have to flounder along picking up tips from magazines and whatnot?
Hmm.  Can I still spell `rhetorical question'?  I think I can.)

Hmm.  This does tend to imply that I might have more joy from ATM if I
switched off the Apple Type 1 Scaler.  Am I feeling brave?

That's what I thought - it had me thinking there was something very odd
going on because of the entry in the AFM ligtable for an `fi' and no clear
difference between the ligature and two characters set next to each other.

Fair enough.
