Bayeux:

Bayeux is an architecture for scalable and fault-tolerant wide-area data
dissemination.  It provides efficient application-level multicast which
scales to large receiver groups while tolerating failures in the network
topology.  Bayeux introduces specific load-balancing mechanisms to
replicate root nodes and obtain more efficient bandwidth utilization.

Bayeux uses the Tapestry architecture to achieve the above properties
while also keeping the transmission overhead low.  They evaluate their
network performance based on two performance metrics, the relative delay
penalty and the physical link stress.

This work is part of the OceanStore project and they are continuing to
evaluate its effectiveness in their simulation environment.  It is not
clear why their underlying hierarchical infrastructure is better than the
other systems such as the projects at MIT, Microsoft, etc.
