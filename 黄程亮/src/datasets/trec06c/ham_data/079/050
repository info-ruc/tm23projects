Bayeux

This paper describes the implementation of Bayeux, an application level
multicast system , which is built upon the Tapestry routing
architecture, thus deriving its falt tolerance properties. A Bayeux
multicast session consists of a session name and a UID. A 160 bit hash
key of this tuple is formed, a a file is created with this identifier,
which placed at the root of the multicast tree. Clients which need to
join, should know the unique tuple. The group membership operations
consist of JOIN,LEAVE,TREE and PRUNE. JOIN messages result in the root
sending a TREE message to the client. NOdes within this route would add
the client ID in their receiver ID list for subsequent packet
forwarding.

The authors evaluate the performance of the multicast implementation
over simple unicast in terms of link stress. They also investigate
issues of tree partitioning due to having just one multicast root. This
problem can be easily alleviated by the Tapestry substrate since it
provides an easy mechanism for creating multiple root nodes. Tapestry
guarantees to find a root with high probablity. Other optmizations to
reduce duplicate packet delivery is to carry out receiver identifier
clustering in order to group nodes which might share the first m bits of
a node ID. Simulations based on this show favorable results. An
interesting evaluation is that of the First Reachable Link selection
protocol in order to ensure high probability of succesful packet
delivery on this multicast network. This method does not use duplicate
packets, but instead involves pervious history of link quality to be
taken into account when calculating the next best link. When a new link
is chosen , the membership state is also propagated.

I think that this work was quite interesting, not in view of introducing
a novel idea, but actually showing the strenghts of the Tapestry routing
protocol and its degree of extensibility for multicast routing. There is
one thing that I could not understand and that was how the Tapestry IDs
were related to IP address space.
