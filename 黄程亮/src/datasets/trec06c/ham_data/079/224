Subject: New articles on Apple and Microsoft font technology
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1015696907.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

The recent articles cited below on Apple and Microsoft font technology
may be of interest to some readers on this list; both are freely
available electronically.

If terms like ATSUI, AAT, GDL, OpenType, and Uniscribe puzzle you, the
articles should help to explain them.

The Correll article compares the Apple and Microsoft approaches to
sophisticated font rendering, including kerns, ligatures, glyph
substitution, and glyph reordering.  The latter two may have received
relatively little attention in the TeX community, yet both are
necessary for support of several of the world's writing systems.

The BibTeX entries are members of both font.bib and unicode.bib in the
TUG bibliography archives at
