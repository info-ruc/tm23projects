Subject: Re: successor to TeXBase1Encoding  with /Euro

Updated files 8r.enc and 8r.etx with support for /Euro
as suggested are available from

  <http://home.vr-web.de/was/psnfss-beta/>

Please, give them a try!  Are there any problems, when using 
them with existing fonts and metrics w/o Euro?

I intend to include 8r.enc with the next release of PSNFSS,
if it proves to be ok.  As to 8r.etx, I suggest to update
the fontinst distribution accordingly.

happy TeXing

Walter
