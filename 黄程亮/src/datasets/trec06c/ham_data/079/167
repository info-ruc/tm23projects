Hi Betsy,

My name is Helen Chang.  I am a fifth grade teacher at West 
Windsor-Plainsboro School District.  Last summer, I planned to visit Japanese 
schools.  The following two professors had graciously made arrangements for 
me to visit some top-rated schools.  
Dr. Misao Hayakawa, Professor of Human Development and Education
School of Education
Nagoya University
Dr.Shigeru Asanuma, Professor of Education and Curriculum Theory
Tokyo Gakkugei University
Due to my other summer commitments and the problem of reserving my ticket, I 
postponed the trip.  I am still thinking about visiting them this year.  If 
you are interested, I can get in touch with them again and make necessay 
arrangements.  
Sincerely,
Helen Chang
