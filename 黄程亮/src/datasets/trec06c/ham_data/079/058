Bayeux: An Architecture for Scalable and Fault-tolerant
Wide-area Data Dissemination
Shelley Q. Zhuang, Ben Y. Zhao, Anthony D. Joseph,

This paper presents a application of Tapestry for multicast.
The key of efficient multicasting is to reduce the data 
Duplication. Because of the routing algorithms of Tapestry,
the nodes with similar suffix can be group together and data
duplication only happens when there is diverge of forwarding.
Further, Bayuex gets the necessary properties like fault 
Tolerance, load balancing and  scalability from the Tapestry.

The algorithms adopted by Bayeux is follows:
1. each session s IDed by a tuple which is broadcast to the
   network. Each client send explicit Join message to root
   to join the tree and forwarding tree is set up when root
   sends Tree message back to the requesting client.

2. for scalability and elimination of single root node 
   failure, the multiple roots of Tapestry is used and clients
   will join the tree rooted at the nearest root node. This
   is very good.

3. explicit clients clustering by assigning to the neighbors 
   nodes with longest suffix.

4. fault tolerance. Tapestry provides two good properties for 
   tolerance. One is backup route for each entry in the routing
   table. The second is the converging feature of naming system
   of Tapestry. Based on these two properties, the paper 
   proposes five fault resilient delivery protocols. Basically,
   different ways choosing backup paths result in those different
   protocols, including proactive duplication which duplicate
   data  simply to its first backup path; application specific 
   information duplication which I like most. For streaming 
   materials, data can be divided into several channel to transfer
   different quality data. Higher resolution data is losable; and
   other protocols considering delay, link traffic metrics.
     
  
comments:
1. Tapestry provides really some nice features which is just what 
   multicasting streaming multimedia application needs. They really
   select a very good application for Tapestry.
2. on the physical link stress, I do not think Bayeux is much
better than the worst case IP unicast in F.4 because it looks
most of links have same stress number like Bayeux.
