CERT Advisory CA-2001-37 Buffer Overflow in UPnP Service On Microsoft Windows

   Original release date: December 20, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Microsoft Windows XP
     * Microsoft Windows ME
     * Microsoft Windows 98
     * Microsoft Windows 98SE

Overview

   Vulnerabilities  in  software included by default on Microsoft Windows
   XP, and optionally on Windows ME and Windows 98, may allow an intruder
   to   execute   arbitrary   code   on  vulnerable  systems,  to  launch
   denial-of-service  attacks  against  vulnerable  systems,  or  to  use
   vulnerable   systems   to  launch  denial-of-service  attacks  against
   third-party systems.

I. Description

   There is a vulnerability in the Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service
   on  Microsoft Windows XP and Microsoft Windows ME that could permit an
   intruder to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges on a
   vulnerable  system.  The  UPnP  service  is  enabled by default on XP.
   Microsoft  does  not ship Windows ME with UPnP enabled by default, but
   some  PC manufacturers do. UPnP may be optionally installed on Windows
   98 and Windows 98SE. This vulnerability was discovered by Eeye Digital
   Security. For more information, see

          http://www.eeye.com/html/Research/Advisories/AD20011220.html
          http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-059.asp

   Universal  Plug  and  Play  (UPnP)  is  a  set of protocols that allow
   computer  systems  and network devices to work together with little or
   no prior configuration.

   One  vulnerability  is a buffer overflow in the code that handles UPnP
   NOTIFY  directives.  This  vulnerability permits an intruder to send a
   malicious  NOTIFY  directive  to  a  vulnerable computer and cause the
   computer  to run code of the intruder's choice. The code will run with
   full  privileges on all vulnerable systems, including Windows XP. This
   can permit an attacker to take complete control of the system.

   A second vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows implementation of UPnP
   could  allow  an  intruder  to  consume  memory  and processor time on
   vulnerable  systems,  resulting in performance degradation. Variations
   on  this  problem  can allow an intruder to use a vulnerable system to
   launch a denial-of-service attack against a third-party.

   For more information about these vulnerabilities, see

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/951555
          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/411059

   These   vulnerabilities   have   been  assigned  the  CVE  identifiers
   CAN-2001-0876 and CAN-2001-0877, respectively.

II. Impact

   Intruders   can  gain  complete  control  of  vulnerable  systems,  or
   interrupt the normal operation of vulnerable systems.

III. Solution

Apply a patch from your vendor

   Microsoft has provided patch information in their bulletin. Please see
   MS01-059, available from

   http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-059.asp

Block Access to UPnP Service

   Until  a  patch  can  be applied, you can reduce your exposure to this
   problem  by  blocking  access  to  ports 1900 and 5000 at your network
   border.  This  does not eliminate your exposure to attacks originating
   from within your network, however.

   Note  that  Microsoft  Internet  Connection  Firewall,  which  runs by
   default  on  Windows  XP, does not provide complete protection against
   this  attack.  Specifically,  an intruder can still use a broadcast or
   multicast  address  to reach the UPnP service on Microsoft Windows. On
   systems that don't require UPnP, it can be disabled.
