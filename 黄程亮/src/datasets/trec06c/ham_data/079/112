To all lesson study practitioners: thank you for the wealth of information 
that you have supplied me about your lesson study efforts nation-wide.  I 
will send you excerpts of the article before I submit it.  What I would like 
to have now are comments regarding your perceptions of the program, e.g. was 
it valuable, what did you learn from it, etc.  
Thanks so much, and Happy Holidays to all!

Janice
