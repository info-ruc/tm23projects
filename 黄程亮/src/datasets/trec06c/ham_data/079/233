Subject: Re: Code for Softmaker

    I was told that Walter Schmidt has proposed the code 5 for the font
    supplier softmaker some time ago. Is this an official code now?

Guess this slipped past me.  (Anyone else want to take over fontname?)

Anyway, I added `5 softmake' to http://tug.org/fontname/supplier.map.

Best,
karl
