Sounds good to me. However the current comments say slots 128--159 are
assigned according to Windows ANSI. Would this be in accordance with that,
or does that use some other slot?

I don't see any reason not to let the new encoding replace the old 8r
completely, i.e., take over the names 8r.enc and TeXBase1Encoding.
According to Berthold a while ago, the 8r encoding was originally designed
with empty slots for the very purpose of allowing for future additions such
as this (although he, as always, was of quite the opposite opinion).
Replacing entry 128 (/.notdef) in TeXBase1Encoding with /Euro has _no
effect_ in fonts which do not have this glyph, and only positive effects in
fonts that do have it.
