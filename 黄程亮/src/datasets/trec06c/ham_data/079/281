To those of you who have completed at least one cycle of lesson study --

What do you wish you had known or understood before you began that might be 
accomplished with some up-front training?

If you were designing a summer training workshop for teachers and 
administrators who are interested in lesson study - what would you include?


I am going to facilitate a novice lesson study team next fall and am 
thinking through how to set them up for the most powerful experience 
possible.

What do you think of a 4-5 day summer workshop led by experienced Japanese 
and American lesson study practitioners (and researchers?) who would serve 
as coaches to the novices?

Institute components:
A general overview of the lesson study research, structure, protocols

Demonstration research lessons with the participants first observing 
experienced observers then practicing collecting evidence of learning 
themselves

Debrief sessions so the participants can practice the reflection protocol

Sessions with experienced LS practitioners on crafting the broad multi-year 
lesson study goal and beginning discussions on the more narrow topic/concept 
goal


I see the benefits of such an experience before attempting lesson study on 
one's own as three-fold:

First - Simply to expose the interested teachers to the general process and 
benefits

Secondly - To help them begin to develop the essential lenses (researcher, 
student, curriculum developer, etc.) Clea Fernandez, Makoto Yoshida and 
Catherine Lewis talk about in their research

Finally - to begin building a support network


I appreciate any recommendations or lessons learned you can share.
