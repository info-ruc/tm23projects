As CENIC moves from a start-up entity with one project, CalREN-2, into a =<br>
mature organization with a broad range of projects designed to serve the =<br>
needs of the broader research and education community across California, =<br>
the Board has recognized the need for a more robust organization.  I am =<br>

CENIC Board Reorganizes Operation<br>
<br>
As a result of the rapid growth and development of CENIC, the Board has =<br>
recognized that additional effort is needed so that CENIC remains able =<br>
to meet its numerous challenges.  The Board has approved a new =<br>
organizational structure employing both a President and a Chief =<br>
Operating Officer.  Tom West will continue as President and a search has =<br>
been launched for a Chief Operating Officer (COO).  In addition, the =<br>
position of Chief Technical Officer has been created to be responsible =<br>
for technical operations.<br>
=20<br>
CENIC s new organization calls for an executive office consisting of the =<br>
President and the Chief Operating Officer.  The President will focus on =<br>
the overall vision, business strategy development and external =<br>
relations.  The President is the primary link between the Board and the =<br>
internal CENIC organization and staff.  The COO s role and functions, =<br>
described below, will focus on implementing the overall programs and =<br>
operations of CENIC.  He/she will work closely with the President to =<br>
develop the strategies and vision.  The chair of the COO search =<br>
committee is Board Chair John Silvester of USC.  Other members include: =<br>
John Charles, David Ernst and Jack McCredie. The search will commence =<br>
immediately and conclude sometime in early spring<br>
=20<br>
The third key position in the organization is the Chief Technology =<br>
Officer (CTO).  The CTO reports directly to the COO and has the major =<br>
responsibilities for development, implementation and operation of the =<br>
technical aspects of CENIC s operations.<br>
=20<br>
The proposed organization builds on the current operations and functions =<br>
of CENIC.  The principles of CENIC remain the same:<br>
1. CENIC will continue to serve as the primary mechanism to develop =<br>
network services for research and education in California and its =<br>
participation in Internet2 and other national and international =<br>
networking infrastructure.<br>
2. CENIC Charter Associate Universities, especially UC and CSU, will =<br>
have an obligation to the State of California and its citizens to meet =<br>
the advanced network service needs of the researchers, faculty and =<br>
students in public K-20 institutions throughout the State.<br>
3. The diverse missions and programs of the CENIC Charter Associate =<br>
Universities will be honored in the overall CalREN strategy.<br>
4. Every effort will be made to achieve financial efficiencies to =<br>
demonstrate the value of belonging to CENIC.<br>
5. The future CENIC financial plans will be developed to reflect the =<br>
framework and the costs to a CENIC Charter Associate will be applied =<br>
according to its level of participation of each service tier.<br>
6. CENIC will continue to draw on or contract with the Charter Associate =<br>
Universities for staff and with outside firms, as appropriate.<br>

Dave Reese Appointed CENIC CTO<br>
=20<br>
Tom West and the CENIC Board are announcing appointment of Dave Reese, =<br>
who has been serving as Chief Network Architect of the Digital =<br>
California Project, as Chief Technical Officer for CENIC.  Reese will =<br>
report directly to the Chief Operating Officer and will oversee all the =<br>
tactical planning, design, implementation and operations of CENIC s =<br>
advanced network services.<br>
<br>
Reese has also been Director, Network Administration and Planning for =<br>
the CSU Office of the Chancellor.  In that position, he is responsible =<br>
for system-wide leadership in the selection and deployment of networking =<br>
technology, the $15.4 million budget of 4CNet, project planning, budget =<br>
preparation, bid preparation and review and tracking technology trends.=20<br>
<br>
Starting in the early 1980 s, Reese has overseen the growth of =<br>
networking in the CSU from a small, two person network staff to today s =<br>
staff of 21 full-time employees and 2 outside contractors who provide =<br>
the administrative, planning, engineering, and 7x24 operations functions =<br>
for 4CNet.  In 1991 Reese was lead manager in the procurement and =<br>
installation of T1 switching equipment as both a performance and =<br>
technology upgrade for CSUnet.  This network upgrade led to CSU s =<br>
provision of video conferencing services on the network.  The increasing =<br>
demand for those services, led Reese to design and implement a =<br>
scheduling system still used today (with continued enhancements, of =<br>
course). =20<br>
In 1995, Reese oversaw the upgrade of the network architecture to DS-3 =<br>
(45Mb) circuits and a private ATM network supporting TCP/IP data and =<br>
two-way compressed video conferencing, including multi-point =<br>
conferencing services.  This expansion led to the California community =<br>
colleges connections to the network and renaming the network.  In 1998 =<br>
Reese supervised another procurement for high-speed transport, both =<br>
Inter- and Intra-LATA, and co-location facilities for the 4CNet =<br>
backbone.  The subsequent installation of OC-3c (155Mb) and OC-12c =<br>
(622Mb) Inter-LATA circuits into facilities co-located in the carrier s =<br>
POP (Point of Presence), and three private OC-48 SONET rings serving the =<br>
CSU campuses in the San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco areas.  =<br>
This, the first move of a large University network into external =<br>
facilities, is now the model sought out in the deployment of Internet2 =<br>
regional networks (also known as Giga-POPs ) throughout the United =<br>
States.<br>
<br>
As CTO, Reese s responsibilities include day-to day oversight and =<br>
management of the following functions: =20<br>
=B7 network planning and development;<br>
=B7 network design and engineering;<br>
=B7 operations for all CENIC networks;<br>
=B7 peering and ISP services;<br>
=B7 planning and implementation of technical aspects of network projects =<br>
(e.g. DCP and ONI); and,<br>
=B7 projects management.<br>
=20<br>
In addition, he will develop strategic directions as part of the CENIC =<br>
executive team; work with the CENIC Technology Advisory Council and =<br>
other groups to ensure the successful planning, development and =<br>
implementation of new advanced network services and infrastructure; and =<br>
report on the work of CENIC technical activities and projects.<br>
=20<br>
About CENIC=20<br>
