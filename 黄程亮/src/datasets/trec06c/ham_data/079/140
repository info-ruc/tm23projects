Subject: [OGD] Den. Terence Read

For those who may have an interest, I received the
following response to an early question that I posted
for a friend on parentage/culture for Den. Terrence
Reed (or Den. Terence Read):

"As to your question on the orchid digest, You may
have the spelling wrong. Den. Terence Read was
registered in 1946 by Read. It is a cross of Gatton
Monarch X Renoun. It is made up of 48.44%nobile,31.25
findlayanum, and 20.31 of aureum. I have had this
plant and treated it like a nobile. I read the posts
but stay out of the discussions."

I have given my friend conventional advice for D.
nobile and will check on D. finlayanum and D. aureum
using the Bakers' great book on this genus.=20

From: Peter Peeters <info@orchidaceae.org>:
>First I would like you to known that only 60% of the Belgians could help
you with this.  Vuylsteke is a name derived from Dutch words.  In
Belgium only the Flemish (60% of the population) speak Dutch, while the
Walloon speak French (we also have less than 1% native German speaking
Belgians).
>This also means that all the people in The Netherlands can help you
because they all speak Dutch  :-)

Not entirely correct, Peter. "all the people in the Netherlands"?
You are forgetting the province of Friesland in the northern Netherlands,
just west of the province=20
of Groningen.  In Friesland, they speak Frisian, a language with no
identifiable counterpart.
Signs, road markers, all are in Frisian, occasionally also in Dutch.

For more info on Frisian: http://www.eurolang.net/Languages/Frisian.htm
In the Netherlands, "For about 350,000 this lesser used language is the
mother tongue."

Subject: [OGD] Papua .. name changes

There seems to be some confusion over the name 'Papua'. It is hardly
surprising.

Pre WW1, the island of New Guinea was divided into 3 administrative areas=
 or
colonies. The western half was called Netherlands (Dutch) New Guinea and =
was
administered by the Dutch East Indies Company from Batavia (now Jakarta).=
 In
the eastern half of the island, the territories to the north of the centr=
al
mountain range were a German colony called Deutch (German) New Guinea, wh=
ile
the British/Australian administered lands to the south of the central
mountains were known as Papua because they adjoined the Gulf of Papua, an=
d
were occupied by peoples known as Papuans (Papua Act, 1903, Canberra).

In WW1, the German portion of the eastern half of the island was captured=
 by
Australian troops, and the 2 territories were eventually amalgamated into=
 a
single Australian-run political entity, named (with stunning originality)=
:
'Papua and New Guinea'. At independance in 1971 this was changed to Papua
New Guinea, which exists today as an nation to the north of the Papuan Gu=
lf,
and inhabited (in the southern half) by Papuans.

Post WW2, the Dutch half of the island, which by then had become informal=
ly
known as West Irian, became part of Indonesia and it's the name was chang=
ed
to Irian Jaya. In January 7th 2002 the Government changed this name to
Papua. 'Papua' is a most unfortunate choice, since historically the name =
has
been
consistently applied to a part of the land (and it's inhabitants) in PNG,
the
neighbouring country. I expect the confusion to continue for a long time,
but there are other recent precendents .... eg where is Macedonia ?

Hi All,

Peter van Toorenenbergen has given an excellent list of available orchid =
CD=20
ROMs in his reply to Terri.
However, for the sake of completeness and for the Orchid Digest viewers'=20
information, I wish to mention another Orchid CD ROM.

M=F6hltiMedia's interactive Orchid CD ROM with more than 7,000 full scree=
n=20
orchid photos with their names, and 20 chapters on various aspects of orc=
hid=20
care, an orchid classification system, and more.

In addition, M=F6hltiMedia has developed an extensive 'smart' Orchid Data=
bases=20
CD ROM for the hobbysists and professionals to store their orchid own=20
collections. This program also produces worksheets to see which orchids h=
ave=20
to repotted, watered, fertiziled, etc. in a certain selectable period. Th=
e=20
database also stores photos/images.

I believe, M=F6hltiMedia gives the latter Orchid Database for free when=20
purchasing the Orchid CD ROM.

Linda Fortner (The Orchid Lady) and Karin Stewart (BellaOnLine) seem to b=
e=20
very positive about M=F6hltiMedia's Orchid CD ROM

I found many details about the Orchd & Databases CD ROMs on M=F6hltiMedia=

Subject: [OGD] Re: Vuylstekeara

Vuylstekeara should be pronounced

Vu (u like in "but") - yl (y like the i of "bit") - ste (e like the ay of
"day") - ke (e like the ay of "day") - a (like in "gap") - ra (a like in
"gap")
All the reference words should be pronounced "Queens' English".  The only
difficulty should be the "R" you have to pronounce like in Edimbough

Good luck.

Iris,

I used to work in the area. There is a very large parking lot in Rockefel=
ler
Center that runs between 48th and 49th Street, just west of Fifth Avenue.=
 In
addition, there are many others in the surrounding blocks.

Rockefeller Center is very easy to get to from Pnn Station and Grand
Central. There are great restaurants and wonderful stores all within a sh=

walking distance.

If anything, It is a lot easier to get to than the Winter Garden.

Subject: [OGD] Den. Berry -- a dud or just misunderstood?

Hi all,

I've had a plant of Den. Berry x kingianum for 6 years now, and after
looking at it today and finding only one measly spike it has been moved
perilously close to The Compost (unless it shapes up immediately).  All
the kingianums are loaded with buds, Berry has always been given the
same treatment and coughed up a wretched few flowers per season, but
this year's non-showing is the worst ever.  Am I missing something in
culture???  I looked up Den. Berry, which is kingianum x Mini Pearl,
hoping to find some explanation for the lack of flowers but came up
empty-handed.
So I can only conclude that it is either a) a loser plant  b) I've
totally screwed up regarding its culture.   Any ideas?

Cheers,
Sue Austin
