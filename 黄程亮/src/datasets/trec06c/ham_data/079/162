Hello:

My name is Bill Jackson. I am math facilitator at School 2 in Paterson, NJ. We have been
doing lesson study for 3 years in collaboration with the Greenwich Japanese School, Makoto
Yoshida,  Clea Fernandez and the Lesson Study Research Group, and the Mid-Atlantic
Eisenhower Consortium. I will try to answer your questions.


> Re<How long have you been working with lesson study?

3 years

> Re<How many teachers in your school participate in lesson study?

All teachers who teach math (our teachers are generalists). This is about 25 teachers plus
out principal, Dr. Lynn Liptak.

> Re<Are you receiving any guidance or training from a teacher who has experience
> with lesson study?

Yes, we have had guidance from Japanese teachers from the Greenwich Japanese School in
greenwich, CN, Makoto Yoshida, Clea Fernandez, Patsy Wang-Iverson, Catherine Lewis and
others.

> re<What challenges have you encountered with making lesson study work in your
> classroom or school?

This is a hard question. There are many challenges of which time will not permit here to
ellaborate on. The main challenges though are--getting teacher buy in, changing
attitudes/beliefs about teaching, coming to a common consensus about what a good lesson
entails, logistical issues such as scheduling, etc.

> Re<What do you feel are the greatest benefits of practicing lesson study?

A common set of beliefs across grade levels, a way of looking at our teaching critically
and improving it, the ability to base research on actual classroom lessons and student
observations, reducing teacher isolation, among others.

> re<Have you used lesson study with pre-service teachers?

yes

> Re<Did pre-service teachers find the process helpful in their development?

Several pre-service teachers expressed the fact that they had never seen anything so
powerful in their classes at the university level. I cannot speak for all pre-service
teachers, however. I think they reacted to it at varying levels and to varying degrees of
benefit.

> Re<Are any colleges currently using lesson study in courses?

I do not know.

> Re<Again thank you to anyone who has time to answer any of these questions.

You are welcome.
