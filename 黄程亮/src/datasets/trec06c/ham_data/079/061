Bayeux: An Architecture for Scalable and Fault-tolerant Wide-area Data
Dissemination.

Bayeux is an application-level multicasting system built on top of the
Tapestry location and routing scheme. The tree-based, source-specific,
explicit-join multicast service is designed for dissemination of streaming
multimedia on the internet. The design goals for Bayeux have been
scalability, efficiency and fault-resilience.

The Bayeux multicast session is identified by the tuple <session name,
UID>. For session advertisement, a 160 bit hash of this tuple is formed and
a trivial file with this name is formed and kept at the multicast
session's root node. Tapestry's location service can then be used to
advertize this document. JOIN, LEAVE, TREE and PRUNE messages are used to
form the multicast tree. A JOIN message is sent by a node willing to join
the tree, and it receives the TREE message as an acknowledgement. A LEAVE
message from a member node is followed by a PRUNE message by the root to
enable the leave operation.

To increase the scalability, Bayeux uses tree-partitioning and receiver
clustering. Tree partitioning is done to create multiple roots and thus
reduce the load on the single node and eliminate a single point of
failure. Receiver identifier clustering allows local nodes to share the
longest possible suffix. This may reduce the length of the path, but at
the same time decreases fault tolerance by increasing the dependence on
the same local set of nodes. Bayeux utilizes Tapestry's redundant routing
paths for fault-resilient packet delivery. Reliance on time-outs has the
potential of increasing the delay, thus affecting the performance of
delay-sensitive streaming multimedia.
