This paper presents Tapestry which is an overlay location and routing
infrastructure that provides location-independent routing of messages
using only point-to-point links and without centralized resources.

Tapestry is a self-organizing, scalable, robust wide-area infrastructure
that efficiently routes requests to contents. It is based on the Plaxton
distributed search technique, augmented with additional mechanisms to
provide availability, scalability and adaptation in the presence of
failure and attacks. It offers system-wide stability through statistics.
Faulty components are masked, failed routes are bypassed, nodes under
attack are removed from the service and communication topologies are
rapidly adapted to circumstances.

Tapestry overcome the limitation of Plaxton - the static nature of
the algorithm. It focuses on supporting dynamic operations in a
decentralized manner. It has additional mechanisms that leverage soft
state information and eliminate the need for global information, root
node vulnerabilities and a lack of adaptability, which provide good
features mentioned above. The simulation results also show that they
have achieved these design goals.
