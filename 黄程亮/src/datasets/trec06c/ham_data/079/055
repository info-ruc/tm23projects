Bayeux is an application-level multicast system intended for streaming 
multimedia from one or few source to large number of destinations. Bayeux 
employs Tapestry for routing and location. It builds a distribution tree for 
multicast while trying to minimize delay and bandwidth use, while handling link 
and node failures.

The goal is to build an efficient network of unicast connections using 
Tapestry, and then create a data distribution tree rooted at the source and 
reaching all multicast members. Tapestry forwarding achieved index-by-index can 
be exploited for multicasting purposes by multiplexing data packets and 
diverging when an index has changed. Bayeux uses Tapestry’s data location 
service to publish multicast session with the hash of a unique tuple at the 
root node. The root node advertises the session, and clients that can identify 
the session can join by sending a JOIN message to the root. The root replies 
with a TREE message, such that routers in the forwarding path maintain a list 
of receiver node Ids. A node can send a LEAVE message to remove itself from the 
session, which triggers a PRUNE message from the root to notify forwarding 
routers of the change. Bayeux was evaluated according to relative delay penalty 
with respect to Tapestry, and physical link stress to measure load balancing. 
It was shown that overall link stress is lower in Bayeux than in unicast. 

This paper also provides scalability enhancements on top of Tapestry. Tapestry 
allows Bayeux to load-balance across multiple root nodes using tree 
partitioning. The root nodes containing the same object are organized into a 
tapestry network, and each advertises he object. Clients join to the closest 
root hence the load is distributed.  Tapestry also enables clustering of 
receiver nodes by id, which further reduces link stress. Bayeux demonstrates an 
efficient use of the Tapestry infrastructure, and seems to demonstrate the 
potential to support wide-area multimedia dissemination. It would be useful to 
actually demonstrate the performance of Bayeux in a real-world scenario.
