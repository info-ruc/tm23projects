Dear Lesson Study Community,

We are sorry about the server access problem that developed last
week. We are now on a new server and there should not be any more
problems. We invite you to join the discussion that has started 
sharing issues, insights and resources about lesson study and related 
topics.

For the next two weeks, we have invited leading educators
implementing lesson study to host the discussion forum. They will
respond to questions, engage in a dialogue with each other, and
discuss issues with other members of the lesson study community:

***BILL JACKSON, Teacher/ Math Specialist at Public School #2,
Paterson, NJ--one of the first teachers in the U.S. to implement
study lessons, and who is currently working closely with Japanese
colleagues to continue refining lesson study.

***JAN GABAY, English Teacher/Staff Developer at The Preuss School,
UCSD--developed and is leading the whole school faculty (middle and
high)through a lesson study process. (Videos of Jan can be see on the
School Renewal WebCenter feature on Lesson Study.)

***Dr. LYNN LIPTAK, Principal of Public School #2, Paterson, NJ--one
of the first principals/ administrators to implement lesson study in
a U.S. school;

***CLEA FERNANDEZ, Assistant Professor and Director of the Lesson
Study Research Group, Teachers College/ Columbia University;

We thank them for launching these "hosted" discussions, and would
like to continue this series by announcing other hosts and specific
topics in the near future.   Please let us know if you have any
suggestions or topics and/ or hosts.  We look forward to your active
participate in the discussion forum at any time.
