Hi All,
My name is Tiphareth Ananda, I work at Smith College in MA.  I am trying to 
gather some information on how lesson study is being used in the U.S. right 
now.  I have created a list of questions relating to the type of information 
I am trying to collect. The first set of questions are around use in the 
classroom.  The second set of questions are about pre-service teachers. If 
anyone would be willing to answer a few questions for me I would be very 
thankful.  I will be using information in part of a paper that I am writing 
up about the process of lesson study.

If you do respond plese include your name, school, age level and state.

Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.
Tiphareth Ananda

Questions:
How long have you been working with lesson study?

How many teachers in your school participate in lesson study?

Are you receiving any guidance or training from a teacher who has experience 
with lesson study?

What challenges have you encountered with making lesson study work in your 
classroom or school?

What do you feel are the greatest benefits of practicing lesson study?


Have you used lesson study with pre-service teachers?

Did pre-service teachers find the process helpful in their development?

Are any colleges currently using lesson study in courses?

Again thank you to anyone who has time to answer any of these questions. 
T.A.
