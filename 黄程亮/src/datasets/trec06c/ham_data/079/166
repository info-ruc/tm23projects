Dear Lesson Study enthusiastics,

I am Betsy King, an elementary school teacher who is in a doctoral program
in Educational Leadership at Mills College in Oakland, Ca. I have read
everything I can find on lesson study (in English) and now want to go to
Japan this summer to observe lesson study in action, up close and personal.
I am aware of the Michigan State University Study Abroad program and would
like to know if there are other trips being planned by/for American
teachers.

Please reply to  <betsyking@att.net>  if you know of any groups going to
Japan this summer or if you know of any Japanese teachers or principals who
would welcome an inquisitive (but polite) American teacher observing their
school.

Thank you for your attention in this matter,

Betsy King
