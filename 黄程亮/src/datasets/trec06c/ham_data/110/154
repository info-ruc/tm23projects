   Hard to say without seeing the script.  Off the top of my head I'd say 
if it's occurring at exactly the same place every time it's your script, it 
happens a long time into the script and most hangs that are display driver 
related occur at the very start of the item file's run and 442 ticks is a 
long long time for any normal sort of hang -- unless your hard disk is 
failing of course.  If it never occurs at the same place in the script then 
it's likely to be another program waking up and doing something, perhaps 
it's Adobe deciding to update itself, could be anti-virus programs doing 
something, who knows.  Or perhaps your computer is riddled with malware and 
it's calling home with your bank account information ;)
