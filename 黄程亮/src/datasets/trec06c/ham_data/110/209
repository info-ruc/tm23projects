JCDL 2006: Opening Information Horizons
11-15 June 2006
Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA

In an effort to encourage promising students involved in digital library
research, the Joint Conference on Digital Libraries 2006 is offering a
limited number of Student Volunteer Awards to students who are willing
to help with conference activities. This is a great opportunity to be a
part of the cutting edge in the digital library research from both the
ACM and IEEE communities. There are plenty of opportunities to interact
with the best and most prominent people in the field!

Volunteer awardees will receive complimentary conference registration,
including continental breakfasts and breaks, regular conference sessions
(excluding tutorial and workshop sessions), the poster and demo session,
and the conference banquet. Student volunteers also get a copy of the
conference proceedings. Travel and lodging expenses will be the
responsibility of the volunteers but assistance in coordinating
roommates amongst those selected will be offered.

Volunteers will work approximately 20 hours during the course of the
conference. Duties will include setting up and cleaning up the
facilities, answering questions from conference attendees, monitoring
sessions, helping with technology facilities (wireless access, email
room, etc.), assisting with registration, and running miscellaneous =20
errands.

If you are an undergraduate or graduate student interested in
volunteering, please complete the Student Volunteer Award Application
Form at www.jcdl2006.org. Applications must be received by March 31,
2006. We will notify the selected students by May 12, 2006.
