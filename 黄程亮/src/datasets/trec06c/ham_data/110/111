Hi Folks,

I'd like to run an experiment presenting written words, where the font =
of the text is either condensed or expanded by a certain factor, so that =
the letters of the word appear either closer together or further apart. =
Microsoft Word allows you to condense or expand text fonts in the RTF =
file, however when I run the file on DMDX the formatting is lost and it =
is presented as standard text. Is there some other way to do this in MS =
Word? Or is there a setting in DMDX which allows this? So far, the only =
way I can come up with is to capture the text as bitmaps and present =
them that way.

Any suggestions appreciated.

Thanks,

Derek
