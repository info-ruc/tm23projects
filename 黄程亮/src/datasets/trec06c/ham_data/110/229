Hi,

i have tried to use testmode 8 to test the response latency of a keyboard
and a gamepad.I found that the response latency was as high as 4000ms while
the RT is just 1000ms. It i strange that the repsonse latency can be larger
than the RT. What is the problem?

Besides, i try to run DMDX in my home destop. when i syntax check the
program, it  said "retrace thread did not self terminate" and stop. When i
run the program, it hang. What is the problem?

Thanks,
HUI YUI CHI
