      Dear  Sir,
                          Request for Confidential Business Relationship.
  
I am Barrister Beki  Opoku Esq. [PROPERTY AND INHENRITANCE LAWYER]. 
   
  I know you don’t know me well, and I don’t know much about you, but I will be very please if this transaction will make us know each other as we both are going to benefit from helping the Dako Family here in Ghana at the moment, I am a solicitor, for 22yrs old boy Peter Dako, he is the son of late Anthony Dako, a diamond dealer and Farmer in Sierra Leone, who was killed by the Sierra Leonia Government due to Crisis that erupted in their country, before his death he has secretly deposited two consignments with a Security Company here in Accra,Ghana and have let it know to his first Son Peter only, as at the time of deposit.  At the moment my client Peter Dako and his only surviving family, which are his mother and sister are here in Ghana, at the Budumburam Refugee Camp.
   Infact their situation is very bad in the Camp, and they are having $35Million in one of the boxes and the other contains diamonds, but the late father deposited it as family valuable and that was the information he told Peter as at the time of deposit, not until about One year after his death that he found out in a secret diary the true contents and the documents showing the deposit of the consignments in the Security Company.    Like he narrated to me, many people have tried to swindle them to get the Consignments out for themselves, but failed. At the end of the day, he was link up to me to help him. That is why I have contacted to you to come to the aid of the survives of the Dako family, to help get the consignment out from the security company.   I will instruct you on how to go, for you to get things done, but I must tell you, that consignment is not safe to be opened here in Ghana, so I will want it to transfer out of Africa, so that the Government here in Ghana or any
 Africa Countries will not seize the funds and the diamonds, due to the rebels in Sierra Leone, they were embargo on Sierra Leone citizens, 
  I want the two consignments to be shipped to you in your country, all necessary arrangements will be made for you to get this consignment safely shipped to you in your country, so that the funds will be invested in a profitable business in your country for the family and get them a better life in your country, I will write you more, but first I want  you to know that you will be rewarded with 20% of the entire contents and 5% of the entire cash will be set aside to upset any expenses made to get the consignments released from the Security Company and shipped to your country, or Europe, to where you think the funds an be   wisely invested. I am not left out, I have been spending for the family too, so I will be giving 10% of the entire funds excluding the diamonds which I will not get anything from, only cash, but you will be reward with 20% of both the cash of $35Million and the total weight of the Diamonds.   I will make sure everything is done under legal grounds without any
 breach of our local laws and any international laws. If it is necessary for you to come I will let you know ASAP.   Please feel free to write me at any time. I hope to hear from you soon,    
 Regard,
 Barrister Jeff  Beki Opoku
