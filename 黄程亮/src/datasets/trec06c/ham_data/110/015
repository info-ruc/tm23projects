Stephanie is being overwhelmed by requests for scantrons from the last exam so we will change the procedure.

I will bring copies of the scantrons to class on Friday and you may pick up a copy if you wish.  The exam key will be available in the office at the front desk.  You may not leave the office with the exam, nor can you copy the exam in any form.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Rick T.
