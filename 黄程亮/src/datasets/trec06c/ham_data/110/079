the target is a Chinese word, but the data is missing in the azk file, so it may have little to do with Analyze.

   Hmm, that's entirely non-trivial.  If you can find a way to strip the 
special characters out you might want to make a special version of the item 
file that's just for use with Analyze and see if that fixes things.  Making 
Analyze aware of different fonts is a ton of work.

The problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be
pretty sure they're going to have some pretty annoying virtues.
