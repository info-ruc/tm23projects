*History G9380: CONSUMER CULTURES IN MODERN **EUROPE** *

Prof. Lisa Tiersten

Monday 11:00am-12:50pm, 405 Barnard Hall

3pts.

=20

This graduate seminar explores the history and historiography of the=20
development of consumer capitalism in modern Europe, from the eighteenth =

century through the middle of the twentieth century. The course will=20
emphasize Britain and France, but we will be thinking and reading=20
comparatively as well. The course will trace the construction of a=20
middle-class model of consumption (first, as it supersedes older=20
aristocratic models and, later, as it confronts an emergent mass=20
culture) but will also attend to differences across nation, social=20
class, and gender. Topics to be covered include theories of consumption, =

the construction of modern gender and class identities through=20
consumption, credit and social trust, and the relationship between=20
consumption and democratic citizenship. Historical studies will be=20
complemented with readings from social theory, cultural studies, and=20
fiction.
