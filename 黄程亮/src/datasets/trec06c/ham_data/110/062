I encountered two mysteries with dmdx:
Mystery 1: while analysing data, I noticed there is no data for Item 11. I checked the item file, it is there, and there is no problem with it. I checked the azk file, Item 11 is missing. But I also notice it is the first item after practice. I moved it to the second item and tested myself, checked the azk file; now the current first item is missing. Summary: the first item after practice does not have data.

Mystery 2: I have 11 Chinese students who showed a 1 ms difference between two conditions (in ism file, same below); I have 8 Japanese students who showed a 7 ms difference between the same two conditions in the same direction (the same experiment). After I combined them into one azk file, and Analyzed it, the difference was 16 ms in the same direction. Why?

Any help would be appreciated.
