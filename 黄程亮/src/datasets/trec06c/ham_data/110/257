2006 THIRD MILLENNIUM FOUNDATION HUMAN RIGHTS FELLOWSHIPS
AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY


Third Millennium Foundation Human Rights Fellowships enable three =
graduating
Columbia University students to spend one year working in human rights. =
The
year is divided between an internship in a developed country and one in =
the
developing world according to the terms and conditions that follow.
Applications for the 2006 Program are due by Friday, February 10, 2006.=20
 =20
Purpose and Terms of Awards

The Columbia TMF Human Rights Fellowship is designed to enable =
graduating
Columbia University  students (both degree and certificate programs) who =
are
interested in pursuing a career in human rights to gain practical work
experience through internships with human rights non-governmental
organizations.   Through these practical training internships, the =
Program
aims to provide the Fellows the skills necessary to start or advance a
career in the field of human rights, whether in academic life, in
governmental, intergovernmental or nongovernmental organizations or
agencies, or as legal practitioners specializing in human rights work.  =
As
it offers the opportunities for Fellows to work in both developing and
industrialized countries the Program is intended to facilitate the =
exchange
of ideas and experiences.

Each year, three fellowships will be awarded to graduating students who =
are
completing degree and/or training programs in human rights at Columbia
University, including, but not limited to, Barnard College, Columbia
College, School of General Studies, Graduate School of Arts and =
Sciences,
Journalism School, Law School, School of International and Public =
Affairs,
School of Public Health, School of Social Work, the Advocates Program of =
the
Center for the Study of Human Rights, among others.

The fellowship, one-year in length, will typically consist of two =
6-month
internship segments.   Each Fellow will conduct one internship in a
developing country and the other in an industrialized nation or the =
Fellow's
home country.  We will also consider applications that combine two =
country
experiences in other sequences.  The Program aims to better equip the
fellows with the necessary skills, knowledge, insights and networks to
further the advancement of human rights.

Each fellowship will carry a stipend of $27,000 a year which would cover =
all
expenses.  The one-year fellowship may begin anytime between June 1 and
October 31.

Qualifying Placements

The host organizations must be engaged in human rights advocacy. =
Applicants
should seek the advice of faculty or staff at a human rights program in
order to identify appropriate host organizations for each of the =
internship
assignments.  In most cases, these organizations or agencies will be
involved in human rights education, monitoring, reporting, litigation,
grassroots mobilization, or other forms of advocacy.  They may be =
involved
in human rights work in general or in specific areas of the human rights
movement such as women's rights, children's rights, labor rights, =
refugees,
humanitarian law, and transitional justice, health care and so on.  Most
qualifying organizations would identify themselves as part of the =
broader,
universal human rights movement, relying on the norms declared in United
Nations and regional treaties and declarations.=20

However, qualifying placements may also include groups embracing new and
interdisciplinary directions in the human rights movement, such as those
following in substantial part a rights-based approach to work in =
economic
development, humanitarian relief, media, health or environmental =
activism.
In special circumstances, the Selection Committee may accept a proposal =
for
work within a governmental or intergovernmental human rights =
organization.
Fellows will be expected to participate in training activities for their
internships.  Preparation will be designed by the fellow and their =
advisor
on an individual basis.=20

Throughout each internship, both supervisors in the host organization =
and
the Fellows will be required to prepare reports evaluating the Fellows'
experiences. Fellows are expected to participate in an annual public TMF
colloquium where old and new Fellows can network and share experiences.  =
