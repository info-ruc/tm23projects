   Pretty weird, those two pieces of code are divorced from each 
other.  Only thing I can think of is that having had another sound request 
made before the background sound you've got the HAL sound system into a 
different state, one where it perhaps doesn't have to set things up again 
each time the 10 second file finishes playing.  Hopefully we'll remember 
your discovery the next time someone hits the background sound gap.
