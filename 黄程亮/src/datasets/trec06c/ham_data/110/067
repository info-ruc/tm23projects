Hi All,

I will use fMRI to run an experiment.  Subjects will see a few words and =
then re-arrange the words following the instruction given to them at the =
beginning of each trial (e.g., "SENTENCE").  After they are done with =
the re-arrangement, they press a button (of a mouse) and then a + sign =
will appear and stay on the screen for 6 seconds.  Subjects don't need =
to to make any response to the + sign.  Here are some of the items:

+1001
"SENTENCE"/
*<t 15000> <ln -6> "HELEN",
<ln -2> "SENT",
<ln 2> "THE PRESENT",
<ln 6> "SANDRA"/!;

2001 "+" <df 375>/!;

I use <g 2> in the parameter line to make the pair go together.

Here is where the file starts to go wrong.  I want to include some =
fillers.  For these fillers, subjects will see something like item 1001 =
above, but then, instead of going to the + sign immediately, they will =
see a multiple choice question.  They have to respond to that question =
by pressing a button.  After that, the + sign will appear and stay on =
the screen for 6 seconds, just like item 2001 above.

The multiple choice question is like this:

+3001
*<ln -3> <x 0.25> "1. Helen sent Sandra the present",
<ln 0> <x 0.25> "2. Sandra sent Helen the present",
<ln 3> <x 0.25> "None of the above"/!;

Here is my question.  Most of the trials do not include a multiple =
question, so I can use <g 2> to make the related items go together.  But =
how do I make the items in the three-step trials go together?  I know I =
probably can use $$ to group each 3-item trial and manually make them =
spread out to the file.  But I was wondering if there is a way to merge =
items 2001 & 3001 into one so that after subject responds to the =
multiple question, the frame can go to the + sign and stay for 6 =
seconds?  The following item is sort of what I have in mind.  But I know =
it doesn't work (and it may look pretty stupid :-P). =20

+4001
*<ln -3> <x 0.25> "1. Helen sent Sandra the present",
<ln 0> <x 0.25> "2. Sandra sent Helen the present",
<ln 3> <x 0.25> "None of the above"/!/"+" <fd 375>/!;

Does anyone have a suggestion?  Thanks in advance!

best,
shiaohui
