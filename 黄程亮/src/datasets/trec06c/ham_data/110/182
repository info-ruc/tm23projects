The experiment calls for 12 minutes of noise masking
sound during the visual task.

DMDX would not let me load a 12 minute WAV file (would
not allocate the buffer for this 9 MB beast), so I
simply play a 10 second noise clip over and over for
12 minutes.  Without Media Life, the clip would play
followed by a noticeble silence (several hundred ms?)
before the loop started again.  This is on a new P4
with 1GB RAM.

<ML> solves this problem!

Thank you jcf for your fantastic work on DMDX and your
very generous support.

Best regards,

Derek
