CS382M-ers,	

1) I will be holding office hours next week on Wednesday 10-11, and on 
Thursday 11-noon.

2) In addition to submitting your hardcopy, don't forget to submit a 
few things electronically.  For everyone, this includes a pdf version 
of your final report.  For those of you doing the empirical project, 
you should also submit (along with a good readme) a set of programs you 
used for your analysis.  These programs should include:
   - the original program you started and ran on the conventional 
processor for comparison
   - a pared down version of the program used as a starting point for 
your TRIPS optimization
   - your final highly optimized version of your program
   - any other versions or alterations that you think are interesting
Please just submit the source code (and assembly code as necessary).  
Everyone should use the following command to submit your files:

csh> turnin --submit skeckler project <filename>

You can turn in tar files if you like.

3) As I mentioned in class, the exam will be comprehensive so you are 
responsible for everything covered in the course, including all 
readings (papers and text), lectures (see notes on web page), and 
homeworks.  The exam will have an parts that are empirical, similar to 
those of the midterm; parts that will require understanding of concept; 
and parts that will require you to draw on your knowledge of how 
different architectural techniques work.  I don't expect you to have 
memorized everything in the course; accordingly, you should expect to 
have some choice among the questions you answer.  Check out lecture27 
on the web page for some additional notes on the exam.

Cheers,

Steve
