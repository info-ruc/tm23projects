Hello,

I'm having trouble getting DMDX to recognize an input device called 'USB
PAD'.  I suspect this is because of the space in the name of the device,
since the message I get when checking the syntax of my script is

	Input Device <USB> selection failed

even though I've entered the name of the input device as 'USB PAD' (minus
the single quotes) in the script .  I've also tried replacing the space
with an underscore and a number of other symbols (as well as inserting a
space as a symbol from the character map in Word), but nothing seems to
work.  Anyone know what might be going wrong here?

Thanks in advance,
Charles
