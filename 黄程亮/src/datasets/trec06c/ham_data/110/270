   It's safe to ignore thread failing to die messages.  Some machines seem 
to take forever to kill off threads that were doing things that are part a 
job that was running, usually it's a video retrace thread, this is the 
first instance of an input thread failing to die that I recall.  Alas I 
never get to see such machines so never get to fully investigate them but 
the work of running the item file and saving the data has already been done 
so they are of no consequence.  If the thread was responsible for saving 
data or some such thing there would be cause for concern but no thread is 
so it's just a case of me religiously sticking error messages around 
everything that possibly could fail and you having a machine that for some 
reason takes forever to kill off threads.
