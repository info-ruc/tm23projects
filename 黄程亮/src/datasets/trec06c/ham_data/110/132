Subject: [DMDX] Windows sound mixer during DMDX?

Precedence: list

his is the situation:  DMDX is running a complex
visual task and I want the subjects to "listen" to an
analog generated "white noise" source injected into
the sound card's "line in" and coming out of the
card's "line out".  Does the Windows mixer mix while
DMDX is running?  Note, DMDX is not being asked to do
anything related to sound here.  

I don't understand the ramifications of DMDX using
DirectX for sound input.  I would have simply tested
this question empirically, but I forgot the cables to
my signal generator at home today :)  

Why bother going through the sound card at all? 
Because in a following test, DMDX is controlling an
audio task and the subjects will be wearing headphones
connected to the sound card.

Thanks,

Derek
