Hi everyone,

I hope your Holiday Break is off to a great start, and that you are all finding time for some well-deserved rest after a very busy quarter. I want to thank everyone for taking the class, and for being so engaged and willing to learn.  I also hope that you are happy with where you placed in the class, although I also hope you realize that the process of learning is at least important (in my opionion more) than the grade.

I have placed your exams in the HPHY office to look at, and if you want to discuss anything, please let me know. John's section is not with Stephanie in the office yet, but should be within a few days.  

I hope you all have a very safe, happy, and restful Break!
