The Civil, Architectural and Environmental Engineering Department of the
University of Missouri-Rolla invites applications or nominations for the
Robert W. Abbett Distinguished Chair in Civil Engineering. The start
date for this endowed appointment is anticipated to be August 2006. We
seek an individual with a well-established, internationally recognized
program of research and scholarly activities in geotechnical engineering
appropriate for an appointment at the full professor level. The
candidate selected will be expected to provide leadership integrating
the expertise of the Department's geotechnical engineering faculty and
its existing enterprise centers in the broad area of geotechnics. The
successful candidate will have the opportunity and responsibility to
define the future directions of the Department's geotechnical
engineering research mission, its state-of-the-art geotechnical
engineering laboratories, and its graduate education program. The
candidate selected will conduct an active, internationally recognized
research in geotechnical engineering that could include (but not be
limited to) geodynamics, transportation geotechnics, soils modeling, and
other associated activities. The successful applicant will be expected
to provide leadership for interdisciplinary collaborative research teams
and projects. Required qualifications include a Bachelor of Science
degree in civil engineering or a closely related field from an
ABET-accredited or equivalent program and an earned PhD in civil
engineering or a closely related field. The successful candidate must be
qualified to teach core undergraduate and graduate geotechnical
engineering courses. A demonstrated ability in superior communication
and interpersonal skills as well as the ability to motivate and inspire
students are also required attributes. The Department's civil
engineering program has been ranked among the top 25 undergraduate and
top 45 graduate civil engineering programs by the U.S. News and World
Report. We currently have 28 full-time faculty members including 4
geotechnical engineering faculty, and an undergraduate enrollment of 250
civil, 120 architectural and 20 environmental engineering students; our
graduate enrollment is approx. 110 students.  Our Department is an
integral supporter of the following research centers: the UMR University
Transportation Center, the Center for Infrastructure Engineering
Studies, the Wei-Wen Yu Center for Cold Form Steel Structures, the
Environmental Research Center for Emerging Contaminants, the Natural
Hazards Mitigation Institute, and the Missouri Local Transportation
Resource Center. Review of applications will begin 2 January 2006 and
will continue until the position is filled. Additional information can
be found at: http://civil.umr.edu/. Applications should include a
statement of teaching and research interests and goals, a complete
curriculum vitae, and complete contact information for at least five
references, and should be sent to: Human Resource Services, RE: Position
Number 00033577, 1870 Miner Circle, University of Missouri-Rolla, Rolla,
MO 65409. Females, minorities, and persons with disabilities are
encouraged to apply. The University of Missouri-Rolla is an affirmative
action/equal opportunity employer and is responsive to the needs of
dual-career couples.
