Hello,

I'm writing a script with 120 main items divided into 20 blocks of 6 items
each.  The thing is that each block of items is also attached to another
item (a comprehension question) about one of the original 6 items in the
block.

I'm able to get DmDX to scramble the items within the blocks, but is there
a way to get DmDX to also scramble the blocks so that the comprehension
question comes after the right block and always at the end of the block?

Currently I'm just scrambling within blocks and using the backslash before
each of the comprehension questions (and then creating random orders of
the blocks myself using Excel).

Second question: I keep getting an error message when I export data after
running the script, which looks something like

!  Error in subject number 1 marked by !!
!  Display error at msec 109941.44, tick 6575 in item 2, frame "In"
!    moved into video memory 442 ticks late
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)

Does this error look like it's arising from an error in my script or some
faulty aspect of the hardware?

Charles
