You probably have a delay parameter (D or <Delay>) in your parameter line 
that's about one and a half seconds too fast.  My guess is that it takes 
your computer a long time to read those bitmaps so the fixation is always 
late.  You might want to look at the <MediaLife> documentation as you would 
appear to be using the same bitmaps over again and if <MediaLife> is used 
correctly they will always be in memory and you can probably keep your low 
delay.
