CS382m-ers,

Kartik and I have finished the grading of the projects and the finals.  
I have also posted the final grades electronically - you should be able 
access them via your UT access.

On or after Wednesday Dec. 21, you may come to my assistant Gem 
Naivar's office (ACES 3.422) to look at your final and the solution. I 
need to keep both of these so you can examine them in the conference 
area outside my office, but you can't leave with them.

I have read all of the project reports, and in general they were pretty 
good.  Kartik also read all of the analytical reports and has provided 
comments from both of us that will be attached to your report. My 
comments are attached to the empirical reports.

I very much enjoyed having all of you in class this semester - it was a 
lively class with lots of great questions and discussions.  I hope you 
all feel like you learned a lot - I'm pretty sure you did.

Best wishes,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
