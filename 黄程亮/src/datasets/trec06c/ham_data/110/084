   Oh, sorry, my bad.  Yeah, if it's missing from the .AZK then DMDX didn't 
run that item.  Could still be the same thing though, older versions of 
DMDX have been caught up time and again by various combinations of 
characters that look like Word's smart quotes.  Try updating to the latest 
version of DMDX and see if the problem goes away.  If it does you might 
want to try the special version of Analyze I just cooked up that ignores 
all things that might or might not be MS smart quotes (meaning they better 
be turned off in Word):

The problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be
pretty sure they're going to have some pretty annoying virtues.
