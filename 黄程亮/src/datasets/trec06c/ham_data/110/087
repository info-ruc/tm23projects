CS382m-ers,

Just a reminder of a few announcements:

1) Final exam is Friday December 16, 9am-noon, PHR 2.114 (our normal 
classroom)

2) Final project reports are due Friday Dec. 9 by 5pm to my assistant 
Gem Naivar in ACES 3.422.  However, I am offering a blanket extension 
until 5pm on Monday Dec. 12.  After that, I will not accept any more 
final reports regardless of any late days you have accumulated.

3) I just posted lecture notes for lectures 25 and 26 on the web page.

See you tomorrow in class.  Please make a point to attend as you will 
also be filling out course evaluations.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
