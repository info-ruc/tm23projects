If you missed our last 3 picks which gained 100% - 300% in a matter of
weeks, 
be sure to make a move on SYNI because this company is on the brink of
explosion, 
and at $0.58/share NOW would be the time build a position! SYNI is able to
create 
hydrogen for cheaper than anyone else, and has the plans to create a
synthetic 
pipeline quality natural gas.
We anticipate this company to be trading around the $1.0/share mark next
week, 
and have a short term target of $3.0/share.

Bio Fuels Made by Avoiding Fermentation Offers Possibility to Reduce
Production Costs 


EDMONTON, AB and LAS VEGAS, NV--(MARKET WIRE)--May 8, 2006 -- Syngas
International Corp. 
(OTC BB:SYNI.OB - News), an emerging leader in the development and
production of hydrogen 
enriched alternative fuels in an environmentally responsible manner, is
pleased to announce 
that it hopes to lower the cost of present North American ethanol
production by converting 
gases produced from its M2 gasifier and PyStR system. Substantial
reductions in ethanol 
production costs could be made possible by replacing corn with less
expensive cellulose-based 
feed stocks. Cellulosic feed stocks include agricultural wastes, grasses
and woods, and other 
low value biomass such as municipal waste.
 
Presently, most Ethanol is produced from the fermentation of sugar by
enzymes produced from 
specific varieties of yeast. The sugar used in Brazilian ethanol comes from
sugar cane as a feed 
stock, whereas in the USA it typically comes from corn. The cost is higher
using corn because 
sugar must first be extracted from the corn. The main process followed is
fermentation, the 
conversion of sugars to ethanol by yeasts in the absence of oxygen. The
Syngas investigation 
will focus on using a lower cost feedstock as well as a catalytic
conversion rather than a 
fermentation process.

The production of ethanol from corn is a mature technology that is not
likely to see significant 
reductions in production costs. Syngas believes the ability to produce bio
fuels such as ethanol 
from low cost biomass will be key to making it competitive as a gasoline
additive supplier.
