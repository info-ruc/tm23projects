Dear all,

  I'm working on a masked priming experiment about psycholinguistic. When using DMDX to display .bmp images (256 colour 8 bits), there's always display error about the timing issue. 

Here is the extract of part of the .rtf file:
-01 <bmp> "fixation" <ms% 1000> / <bmp> "L_ArrowPrime" <ms% 16> / <bmp> "Mask" <ms% 100> / <bmp> * "L_ArrowTarget" <ms% 100> /;
-02 <bmp> "fixation" <ms% 1000> / <bmp> "L_ArrowPrime" <ms% 16>/ <bmp> "Mask" <ms% 100>/ <bmp> * "L_ArrowTarget" <ms% 100> /;
+03 <bmp> "fixation" <ms% 1000> / <bmp> "R_ArrowPrime" <ms% 16>  / <bmp> "Mask" <ms% 100>/ <bmp> * "R_ArrowTarget" <ms% 100> /;
+04 <bmp> "fixation" <ms% 1000> / <bmp> "R_ArrowPrime" <ms% 16>  / <bmp> "Mask"<ms% 100> / <bmp> * "R_ArrowTarget"<ms% 100> /;
-05 <bmp> "fixation" <ms% 1000> / <bmp> "R_ArrowPrime" <ms% 16>  / <bmp> "Mask" <ms% 100>/ <bmp> * "R_ArrowTarget"<ms% 100>/;

And the error message:
!  Display error at msec 8462.76, tick 714 in item 2, frame "fixation"
!    moved into video memory 78 ticks late
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)

Any help will be appreciated! Thanks!

Vannessa
