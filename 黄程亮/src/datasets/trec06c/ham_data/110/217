It was great taking cs382m with all of you.  And if you are still 
reading this list after the final has ended, then you are a true 
computer architecture fan.

I am a huge fan of computer history, and there are many books out there, 
but in my opinion this is one of the very best:

"The Supermen : The Story of Seymour Cray and the Technical Wizards 
Behind the Supercomputer" by Charles Murray

http://tinyurl.com/atoth

We live in a relatively boring time in computer history.  Computers have 
only increased in speed by a factor of 100 in the past 10 years.  
Imagine a decade where computers increased in speed by a million times, 
when people's very lives depended on the speed of computers, and when 
anything was possible in computer architecture and computer architects 
reached the status of gods. 

This book traces Seymore Cray's life throughout the trials and 
tribulations of each of his companies and projects and is based on 
actual eye witness accounts from his friends and colleagues.  In this 
book you will truly get a flavor of what it was actually like to work in 
startup companies and to build computers back in the golden era of the 
supercomputer.

Well, at least I enjoyed it very much.  You may too.
