             WESTERN HEMISPHERE TROPICAL CYCLONE NAMES for 2006

     Tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, and
  Caribbean Sea are assigned names by the Tropical Prediction Center/
  National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida.   A separate alphabetical
  set of alternating male/female names is used each year with the name
  of the first tropical storm beginning with the letter "A".  Names are
  repeated every six years.  The names of hurricanes which cause a lot
  of damage and/or fatalities are usually retired from the list with
  another name of the same alphabetical rank and gender replacing it.
  Following the 2005 season, the names Dennis, Katrina, Rita, Stan
  and Wilma were retired and have been replaced in the list for 2011
  with Don, Katia, Rina, Sean and Whitney, respectively.  It seemed
  likely that Emily also would have been retired, but Mexico did not
  request it, so Emily remains in the list for 2011.

     The highest number of tropical storms named in one season in the
  Atlantic was 27 during the incredibly active 2005 season, which has
  become the most active Atlantic tropical cyclone season on record.
  Other very active seasons include 1887 (19 storms), 1933 (21 storms),
  1969 (18 storms) and 1995 (19 storms).

     The list of names for 2006 is the same one used during the active
  hurricane season of 2000 when fourteen tropical cyclones were named,
  down through Nadine.  The only name retired after the 2000 season was
  Keith, and that name has been replaced with Kirk in the 2006 list.

     TPC/NHC also has warning responsibility for the Eastern North
  Pacific Ocean from the west coast of Mexico out to longitude 140W.
  Six separate alphabetical sets of names are used for this basin in
  the same manner as in the Atlantic.  Initially, the Eastern Pacific
  name sets contained only 21 names, omitting "Q" and "U" and ending
  with the letter "W", as in the Atlantic.  When the active 1985 season
  threatened to exhaust the list, the names Xina, York and Zelda were
  drafted to accommodate any additional storms which might develop.
  (Hurricane Xina was named in late October, 1985.)  The decision was
  made sometime in the latter 1980s to extend the list with these three
  names in odd-numbered years, and to add the names Xavier, Yolanda and
  Zeke in even-numbered years (to preserve the alternating gender
  scheme).  During the Northeast Pacific's year of record activity in
  1992, all 24 names were allotted to tropical cyclones forming east of
  140W, ending with Tropical Storm Zeke in late October.  Had more =
storms
  developed, they would have been named with the letters of the Greek
  alphabet (Alpha, Beta, etc), which is also the backup plan for the
  Atlantic basin in case more than 21 tropical storms develop in a =
single
  season.

    The list for this year was last used in 2000 when seventeen tropical
  cyclones were named, the last one being Rosa.   The most active season
  to utilize this set of names was in 1982, when 19 cyclones were named,
  down through Tara.

     The Central Pacific Hurricane Center, located in Honolulu, has
  tropical cyclone warning responsibility for that portion of the North
  Pacific Ocean lying between longitudes 140W and 180.  The majority of
  the tropical storms and hurricanes seen in that region are visitors
  from east of 140W, but on the average about one tropical storm forms
  in the Central Pacific each year, and when this happens, the storm is
  given a Hawaiian name.   The list consists of four sets of twelve
  names each, using only the letters of the Hawaiian alphabet.  All the
  names are used--the first storm to form in a given year is assigned
  the next available name on the list.  No tropical cyclones were named
  by CPHC in 2003 or in 2004.  The last storm to form in Central Pacific
  waters was Hurricane Huko in late October, 2002, so the next name to =
be
  assigned will be Ioke.

                         Sources of Information
                         ----------------------

     The primary sources of tracking and intensity information for
  Southwest Indian Ocean tropical cyclones are the warnings issued by
  the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre on La Reunion Island, part of
  Meteo France (MFR), and the Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre
  for the basin.    However, tropical cyclones in this region are named=20
  by the Sub-regional Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centres in Mauritius and =

  respective areas of naming responsibility.  The La Reunion centre only =

  advises these agencies regarding the intensity of tropical systems. =20
  References to sustained winds imply a 10-minute averaging period =
unless

     In the companion tropical cyclone tracks file, I occasionally

  Center (JTWC) of the U. S. Air Force and Navy, located at Pearl
  Harbor, Hawaii, when they differ from MFR's coordinates by usually
  40-50 nm or more.  The JTWC warnings are also the source of the
  1-minute average maximum sustained wind values included in the
  tracks file.    Additionally, information describing details of
  satellite imagery and atmospheric circulation features included in
  the narratives is often gleaned from the JTWC warnings.


            Southwest Indian Ocean Tropical Activity for March
            --------------------------------------------------

     Three tropical systems were in warning status during the month of
  March in the Southwest Indian Ocean basin, all during the first part =
of
  the month.  Intense Tropical Cyclone Carina was near its peak =
intensity
  over the east-central portion of the basin on 1 March, but encountered
  a hostile environment which led to its very rapid weakening and
  dissipation by 3 March.  The report on Carina may be found in the
  February summary.

     Severe Tropical Storm Diwa operated from the 2nd until the 10th =
over
  the western portion of the basin, passing southward between the =
Mascarene
  Islands (Reunion and Mauritius) and Madagascar.  Diwa originated as a
  large, sloppily-organized monsoon depression which gradually acquired
  tropical storm characteristics.  A report on Diwa follows.

     Meteo France on La Reunion (MFR) issued two warnings on another
  system, numbered as Tropical Disturbance 12.  At 0600 UTC on 4 March =
this
  disturbance was centered approximately 200 north-northeast of Tromelin
  Island, or about 335 nm due north of the center of Tropical Storm =
Diwa.
  Peak 10-min avg winds were estimated at 25 kts, locally reaching 30 =
kts
  in squalls.  The system moved rapidly southeastward around the north-
  eastern periphery of Diwa, and the second and final MFR warning at =
1200
  UTC placed the center of the disturbance about 190 nm east of Tromelin
  and about 240 nm northeast of Diwa's center.  No more warnings were
  issued, and due to the large size of the circulation around Diwa, it
  is assumed that the weak Tropical Disturbance 12 was absorbed into the
  circulation of the tropical storm.

  Diwa: contributed by Malawi

  A. Introduction and Storm Origins
  ---------------------------------

     Tropical Storm Diwa was a large, odd tropical storm which occupied
  the first week of March moving slowly southward through the Southwest
  Indian Ocean between Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands.  Diwa was
  in its early stages actually a monsoon depression which developed =
gales
  along its periphery.  In the author's opinion, the Meteorological =
Service
  of Mauritius is to be commended for assigning a name and treating the
  system as a tropical storm when it was apparent it was intensifying =
and
  becoming an increasing threat.  Another unusual feature of Tropical =
Storm
  Diwa was that it achieved its peak intensity and most tropical-like
  structure after moving into subtropical latitudes--something rarely =
seen
  in the Southwest Indian basin.

     MFR issued their first warning on the pre-Diwa system at 0600 UTC =
on
  2 March, calling it simply a "zone of disturbed weather" located about
  175 nm southeast of the island of Agalega.   Around the same time JTWC
  included the disturbance in a STWO, noting that it was a elongated =
LLCC
  embedded within the monsoon trough east of Madagascar.  Convection had
  been increasing near the low-level disturbance, and an upper-level =
ridge
  axis to the north was helping to provide an environment of low =
vertical
  shear and favorable diffluence aloft.   On their second bulletin, =
issued
  at 02/1200 UTC, MFR upgraded the area to Tropical Disturbance 11 with
  winds estimated at 25 kts.  St. Brandon, well to the southeast, =
reported
  10-min avg winds of 35 kts with a SLP of 1002 hPa at 02/2100 UTC.  =
JTWC
  upgraded the development potential to 'fair' at 1800 UTC since =
convection
  was persisting near the LLCC.


  B. Synoptic History
  -------------------

     MFR upgraded the disturbance to a 30-kt tropical depression at 0600
  UTC on 3 March, and at 1200 UTC the system was upgraded to Tropical
  Storm Diwa, centered at the time about 125 nm west of St. Brandon.  =
The
  MFR warning noted that the system had a monsoon depression structure
  with weak winds near the center but with gales, locally reaching 40 =
kts,
  over 100 nm from the center in the eastern semicircle under the
  convective bands.  JTWC issued a TCFA at 03/2100 UTC and the first
  warning on TC-16S followed at 04/0000 UTC.   In its formative stages
  Diwa had moved basically to the south, but by now was moving on a slow
  southwesterly track under the influence of ridging to the southeast.
  After having reached tropical storm intensity, however, the storm did
  not strengthen significantly during the next three days.  By the 5th
  Diwa had turned to the south, although it made a jog to the southwest =
on
  the 6th.   Tropical Storm Diwa passed about 200 nm west of Mauritius
  around 0900 UTC on 5 March and about 100 nm west of Reunion Island =
around
  1500 UTC the same day.  Earlier on 3 March, while Diwa's center was a
  little less than 200 nm northwest of Mauritius, a wind gust to 59 kts =
was
  recorded at 2130 UTC at Savannah, a location in the southeastern part =
of
  Mauritius near L'Escalier.  (This observation, as well as the earlier
  one taken from St. Brandon, was sent by Patrick Hoareau.)

     After the aforementioned jog to the southwest, Diwa's motion became
  primarily south-southeastward ahead of an approaching baroclinic zone.
  The storm gradually began to strengthen--the MSW was upped to 40 kts =
at
  06/0600 UTC and to 50 kts at 07/0000 UTC.  Diwa was experiencing
  favorable poleward and equatorward outflow with the deepest convection
  located in the southeastern quadrant.  Both JTWC and MFR upped their
  respective MSW estimates to 55 kts at 0600 UTC 8 March.  Diwa by this
  time was tracking southeastward at 15 kts along the southwestern
  periphery of a mid-level ridge to the east.  The tropical storm was
  beginning to interact with a baroclinic zone to the south, but =
enhanced
  poleward outflow was leading to an increase in convection.  Based upon
  MFR's analysis, Severe Tropical Storm Diwa reached its peak intensity
  of 60 kts (10-min avg) at 08/1200 UTC while centered approximately
  475 nm south-southeast of Reunion Island.   MFR maintained Diwa at
  60 kts for the next warning at 1800 UTC, but JTWC issued their final
  warning at that time, deeming extratropical transition to be well
  under way and estimating the intensity at only 35 kts.   Six hours =
later
  MFR classified Diwa as a 55-kt extratropical storm but continued to
  issue warnings for the next 36 hours as ex-Diwa continued to track off =

  into the subtropical South Indian Ocean.  The final MFR warning, =
issued
  at 10/1200 UTC, placed a weakening 40-kt center a little more than
  1300 nm southeast of Reunion Island.

  Activity for March:  2 tropical LOWs

                 Northwest Australia/Southeast Indian Ocean
                        Tropical Activity for March
                 ------------------------------------------

     After a rather quiet February in which only one minor tropical =
cyclone
  (Emma) formed, the tropical seas off northern and northwestern =
Australia
  became quite active during March.  Four tropical LOWs were tracked by
  the Darwin and Perth TCWCs with two of these becoming the very intense
  cyclones Floyd and Glenda.     Reports on these two severe tropical
  cyclones follow.

     A weak tropical LOW formed late on 28 February just west of the
  Indonesian island of Jamdena, where the Arafura and Banda Seas meet.
  During the first week of March this system drifted southwestward, then
  erratically westward, crossing the island of Timor and passing south
  of Sumba.  By 5 March the westward motion ceased and the LOW turned
  toward the southeast toward the Kimberley region of Western Australia.
  The highest MSW estimated for this LOW was 30 kts briefly on 2 March;
  the remainder of the time peak winds were estimated at only 25 kts.
  Gale warnings were issued by Darwin and Perth in the anticipation that
  the LOW would strengthen into a tropical cyclone.  This failed to
  materialize, however, and the final gale warning by BoM Perth was =
issued
  at 0400 UTC on 7 March.  By 0400 UTC on 8 March the weakening LOW was
  inland in the Kimberley region.

     A graphic depicting the operational track of this tropical LOW may
  be found at the following link:

  =
<http://www.tropicalcyclone2005.com/database/2006/SOHEM/BT-IMAGES/2006-01=
D-NONAME.gif>

     The Perth TCWC also issued several gale warnings in late March for =
a
  tropical LOW which formed over waters southwest of Christmas Island =
and
  east of the Cocos Islands.  The first warning was issued at 0300 UTC =
on
  26 March and the system subsequently drifted pretty much due =
southward.
  The final gale warning was issued by Perth at 27/0600 UTC, but the
  remnant LOW continued to generate some Dvorak ratings of T2.5/2.5 by
  various agencies until early on the 29th.  A very broad cyclonic
  circulation existed in the area with possible multiple LLCCs, and =
there
  were considerable differences in the center fixes from the satellite
  analysis agencies.   Disturbed weather continued in the region for
  several days, and during the first week of April another LOW developed
  which ultimately became Tropical Storm Elia in the Southwest Indian =
Ocean
  basin.   There does not appear to be, however, any direct continuity=20
  between the late March tropical LOW and the LLCC which became Elia.

                                  (TC-19S)
                               19 - 27 March
             -------------------------------------------------

  (Editor's Note:  The following report on Severe Tropical Cyclone Floyd
  is based largely on a preliminary report on this storm written and =
sent
  to the author by Joe Courtney, a forecaster at the Perth TCWC.  A very =

  big thanks to Joe for sending the report.)

  A. Introduction
  ---------------

     Floyd was a midget tropical cyclone that reached top-end Category 4
  (Australian cyclone scale) intensity before rapidly weakening under
  northwesterly shear.  Tropical cyclone advices were issued for the
  western Pilbara region and for upper western coastal areas of Western
  Australia as Floyd approached, but the system weakened and remained
  offshore and did not impact coastal parts.  Floyd did have an economic
  impact as some resource companies evacuated offshore oil and gas
  installations.


  B. Origins and Synoptic History
  -------------------------------

     A tropical LOW developed on 18 March south of the Indonesian island
  of Sumba and moved to the west to southwest, gradually strengthening.
  The LOW is estimated to have reached cyclone intensity around 2100 UTC
  on 20 March while located roughly 450 nm west-northwest of Cape
  Leveque.  The moderate easterly shear on the 21st gradually eased and
  Floyd developed rapidly later on the 22nd, reaching Category 3 (65 =
kts)
  intensity around 23/0000 UTC while located about 560 nm =
north-northwest
  of Exmouth.   Infrared satellite imagery on the 22nd had revealed very
  cold cloud tops.

     Severe Tropical Cyclone Floyd reached its maximum intensity of 105 =
kts
  at 24/0000 UTC, centred approximately 530 nm northwest of Exmouth.  =
The
  cyclone at the time was making a turn to the south due to the approach
  of a mid-latitude trough.  The eye of the system was very small with a
  diameter of about 10-15 nm, and the minimum CP was estimated at 915 =
hPa.
  JTWC's peak 1-min avg MSW was a comparable 115 kts, and =
hurricane-force
  winds extended outward from the center only about 20 nm.   Arguably
  Floyd may have reached Category 5 intensity on the basis of an =
infrared
  image at 23/2330 UTC showing a Data T-number of 6.5.  However, images
  at 23/2130 and 24/0130 UTC showed Data T-numbers of only 5.5 and 5.0,
  respectively.

     Floyd slowly weakened as it moved on a southeasterly track towards =
the
  northwestern coastline of Western Australia.  Microwave imagery showed
  that Floyd underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on the 24th,
  culminating around 25/0000 UTC.   The cyclone's intensity at that time
  was still estimated at 90 kts, but Floyd continued to weaken more =
rapidly
  thereafter as it encountered increasing upper-level northwesterlies.  =
The
  storm reached a point about 155 nm northwest of Exmouth at 26/1200 =
UTC,
  but had encountered cooler SSTs and strong upper-level winds.  A post-
  cyclone analysis revealed that likely winds were below gale force by
  26/1800 UTC, but operationally Floyd was maintained as a tropical =
cyclone
  until 0200 UTC on the 27th when it was downgraded to a tropical LOW.
  A QuikScat image at 26/0925 UTC had indicated that peak winds were =
barely
  of gale force.   The final advice, issued at 27/0200 UTC, placed the
  center of the former tropical cyclone to the west-northwest of =
Exmouth,
  near 20.9N/111.6E.  The remnant LOW continued to drift southwards off
  the Western Australian coast for a few more days.

  C. Damage and Casualties
  ------------------------

     There are no impacts from Tropical Cyclone Floyd, although some
  economic losses were incurred with the evacuation of some offshore
  oil and gas installations.

  (Report based largely on a report received from Joe Courtney of the
  BoM Perth TCWC)



                       SEVERE TROPICAL CYCLONE GLENDA
                                  (TC-20S)
                               23 - 31 March
             --------------------------------------------------

  A. Introduction and Storm Origins
  ---------------------------------

     Glenda was a severe tropical cyclone which followed closely on the
  heels of Floyd in waters off Western Australia.  Whereas Floyd =
dissipated
  offshore, Glenda made landfall near Onslow as a Category 3 cyclone
  (Australian scale) with peak 10-min avg winds estimated near 95 kts.
  The storm had peaked a couple of days earlier as a Category 5 cyclone =
but
  fortunately weakened some as it approached the coast.

     Glenda had its origins over the Northern Territory.  On 20 March a
  1004-hPa tropical LOW was located over the Top End near Katherine.  =
This
  LOW subsequently moved westward and by early on the 22nd had moved out
  over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf about 55 nm west of Port Keats.  BoM
  Darwin initiated tropical cyclone advices on the developing system at
  2130 UTC on 23 March with the LOW centered on the coast about 45 nm
  east-northeast of Wyndham.  The LOW moved very slowly for a couple of
  days, remaining in the extreme southern portion of the Joseph =
Bonaparte
  Gulf before commencing a westerly heading which took it inland across =
the
  extreme northeastern portion of Western Australia.   Environmental
  conditions were very favorable for intensification with a developing
  anticyclone over the disturbance, providing low vertical shear and
  good radial outflow.

     Emerging into the Timor Sea on 26 March, the LOW began to slowly
  strengthen and BoM Perth began issuing shipping warnings at 26/1500 =
UTC.
  The system was then centered approximately 200 nm northeast of Broome
  and moving west-southwestward at about 4 kts.   Associated convection
  continued to consolidate and JTWC issued their first warning on TC-20S
  at 27/0000 UTC.  Three hours later, Perth upgraded the system to =
Tropical
  Cyclone Glenda, centered about 140 nm north of Derby and moving =
westward
  at 5 kts.


  B. Synoptic History
  -------------------

     Once named as a cyclone, Glenda intensified very rapidly.  At =
27/1200
  UTC, only nine hours after being upgraded, Glenda had reached severe
  tropical cyclone (i.e., hurricane) status with 65-kt winds.  The storm
  embarked on a west-southwesterly track which gradually became more
  southwesterly.   Environmental conditions were very favorable for
  intensification and Glenda continued to strengthen, reaching its peak
  intensity of 115 kts at 28/1200 UTC while centered about 245 nm north-
  northeast of Port Hedland, moving southwestward at 10 kts.  (JTWC's
  peak 1-min avg MSW was 140 kts at 28/1200 UTC.)   Glenda's estimated
  lowest CP was 910 hPa.  The storm was being steered by a 500-mb ridge
  to the southwest over Australia, and as a mid-latitude trough over the
  west coast of Australia began to create a weakness in the ridge, the
  cyclone turned to a more southwesterly track toward the northwestern
  coastline of Western Australia.

     Fortunately Glenda's strength began to ebb as the dangerous storm
  neared the coast.   By 0800 UTC on 30 March the center of Severe
  Tropical Cyclone Glenda was beginning to cross the coastline between
  Onslow and Dampier.  The CP was then estimated at 930 hPa and peak
  gusts near the center were estimated at 135 kts, which translates into
  a 10-min mean wind of 95 kts.  At 30/1200 UTC Glenda's center was
  located only 20 km east of Onslow and moving south-southwestward at
  11 kts.  Once inland Glenda's track became more southerly with hints
  of a recurvature to the south-southeast by the time the final advice
  was issued at 31/0300 UTC.  As is typical with landfalling tropical
  cyclones, Glenda began to quickly weaken after the center had moved
  inland.  The final BoM advice placed the center of the former tropical
  cyclone about 250 km south-southeast of Exmouth with a MSW of 30 kts.
  (Interestingly, JTWC issued their final warning on Glenda with the
  center barely inland and with the MSW (1-min avg) estimated at 90 =
kts.)

  website at the following URL:

S-GLENDA.gif>


  C. Damage and Casualties
  ------------------------

     The weakening of the cyclone, coupled with the preparedness of the
  city of Onslow, helped to avert major damage.  The BoM report =
referenced
  above seems to be a work in progress, and it is likely that further
  information will be added after a post-storm analysis is completed.

         SPECIAL FEATURE - SOURCES OF TROPICAL CYCLONE INFORMATION

     The purpose of this section is to list some websites where many and
  varied types of tropical cyclone information are archived.  Many =
readers
  will know about these already, but for the benefit of those who don't,
  I wanted to include them.=20

                              EXTRA FEATURE

     In order to shorten the amount of typing in preparing the narrative
  material, I have been in the habit of freely using abbreviations and
  acronyms.   I have tried to define most of these with the first usage
  in a given summary, but I may have missed one now and then.  Most of
  these are probably understood by a majority of readers but perhaps a
  few aren't clear to some.  To remedy this I developed a Glossary of
  Abbreviations and Acronyms which I first included in the August, 1998
  summary.  I don't normally include the Glossary in most months in
  order to help keep them from being too long.  If anyone would like to
  receive a copy of the Glossary, please e-mail me and I'll be happy
  to send them a copy.

  =
*************************************************************************=


  AUTHOR'S NOTE:  This summary should be considered a very preliminary=20
  overview of the tropical cyclones that occur in each month. The =
cyclone
  tracks (provided separately) will generally be based upon operational
  warnings issued by the various tropical cyclone warning centers.  The
  information contained therein may differ somewhat from the tracking =
and
  intensity information obtained from a "best-track" file which is based
  on a detailed post-seasonal analysis of all available data. =
Information
  on where to find official "best-track" files from the various warning
  centers will be passed along from time to time.

    The track files are not being sent via e-mail.  They can be =
retrieved
  from the archive sites listed below.  (Note: I do have a limited =
e-mail
  distribution list for the track files.    If anyone wishes to receive
  these via e-mail, please send me a message.)

    Both the summaries and the track files are standard text files
  created in DOS editor.  Download to disk and use a viewer such as
  Notepad or DOS editor to view the files.

     The first summary in this series covered the month of October,
  1997.   Back issues can be obtained from the following websites

<DIV>&nbsp; A. Introduction and Storm Origins<BR>&nbsp;=20
---------------------------------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tropical Storm Diwa was a large, odd =
tropical=20
storm which occupied<BR>&nbsp; the first week of March moving slowly =
southward=20
through the Southwest<BR>&nbsp; Indian Ocean between Madagascar and the=20
Mascarene Islands.&nbsp; Diwa was<BR>&nbsp; in its early stages actually =
a=20
monsoon depression which developed gales<BR>&nbsp; along its =
periphery.&nbsp; In=20
the author's opinion, the Meteorological Service<BR>&nbsp; of Mauritius =
is to be=20
commended for assigning a name and treating the<BR>&nbsp; system as a =
tropical=20
storm when it was apparent it was intensifying and<BR>&nbsp; becoming an =

increasing threat.&nbsp; Another unusual feature of Tropical =
Storm<BR>&nbsp;=20
Diwa was that it achieved its peak intensity and most =
tropical-like<BR>&nbsp;=20
structure after moving into subtropical latitudes--something rarely=20
seen<BR>&nbsp; in the Southwest Indian basin.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFR issued their first warning on the =
pre-Diwa=20
system at 0600 UTC on<BR>&nbsp; 2 March, calling it simply a "zone of =
disturbed=20
weather" located about<BR>&nbsp; 175 nm southeast of the island of=20
Agalega.&nbsp;&nbsp; Around the same time JTWC<BR>&nbsp; included the=20
disturbance in a STWO, noting that it was a elongated LLCC<BR>&nbsp; =
embedded=20
within the monsoon trough east of Madagascar.&nbsp; Convection =
had<BR>&nbsp;=20
been increasing near the low-level disturbance, and an upper-level=20
ridge<BR>&nbsp; axis to the north was helping to provide an environment =
of low=20
vertical<BR>&nbsp; shear and favorable diffluence aloft.&nbsp;&nbsp; On =
their=20
second bulletin, issued<BR>&nbsp; at 02/1200 UTC, MFR upgraded the area =
to=20
Tropical Disturbance 11 with<BR>&nbsp; winds estimated at 25 kts.&nbsp; =
St.=20
Brandon, well to the southeast, reported<BR>&nbsp; 10-min avg winds of =
35 kts=20
with a SLP of 1002 hPa at 02/2100 UTC.&nbsp; JTWC<BR>&nbsp; upgraded the =

development potential to 'fair' at 1800 UTC since convection<BR>&nbsp; =
was=20
persisting near the LLCC.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR>&nbsp; B. Synoptic History<BR>&nbsp; -------------------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MFR upgraded the disturbance to a 30-kt =
tropical=20
depression at 0600<BR>&nbsp; UTC on 3 March, and at 1200 UTC the system =
was=20
upgraded to Tropical<BR>&nbsp; Storm Diwa, centered at the time about =
125 nm=20
west of St. Brandon.&nbsp; The<BR>&nbsp; MFR warning noted that the =
system had a=20
monsoon depression structure<BR>&nbsp; with weak winds near the center =
but with=20
gales, locally reaching 40 kts,<BR>&nbsp; over 100 nm from the center in =
the=20
eastern semicircle under the<BR>&nbsp; convective bands.&nbsp; JTWC =
issued a=20
TCFA at 03/2100 UTC and the first<BR>&nbsp; warning on TC-16S followed =
at=20
04/0000 UTC.&nbsp;&nbsp; In its formative stages<BR>&nbsp; Diwa had =
moved=20
basically to the south, but by now was moving on a slow<BR>&nbsp; =
southwesterly=20
track under the influence of ridging to the southeast.<BR>&nbsp; After =
having=20
reached tropical storm intensity, however, the storm did<BR>&nbsp; not=20
strengthen significantly during the next three days.&nbsp; By the =
5th<BR>&nbsp;=20
Diwa had turned to the south, although it made a jog to the southwest=20
on<BR>&nbsp; the 6th.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tropical Storm Diwa passed about 200 =
nm west=20
of Mauritius<BR>&nbsp; around 0900 UTC on 5 March and about 100 nm west =
of=20
Reunion Island around<BR>&nbsp; 1500 UTC the same day.&nbsp; Earlier on =
3 March,=20
while Diwa's center was a<BR>&nbsp; little less than 200 nm northwest of =

Mauritius, a wind gust to 59 kts was<BR>&nbsp; recorded at 2130 UTC at =
Savannah,=20
a location in the southeastern part of<BR>&nbsp; Mauritius near=20
L'Escalier.&nbsp; (This observation, as well as the earlier<BR>&nbsp; =
one taken=20
from St. Brandon, was sent by Patrick Hoareau.)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the aforementioned jog to the =
southwest,=20
Diwa's motion became<BR>&nbsp; primarily south-southeastward ahead of an =

approaching baroclinic zone.<BR>&nbsp; The storm gradually began to=20
strengthen--the MSW was upped to 40 kts at<BR>&nbsp; 06/0600 UTC and to =
50 kts=20
at 07/0000 UTC.&nbsp; Diwa was experiencing<BR>&nbsp; favorable poleward =
and=20
equatorward outflow with the deepest convection<BR>&nbsp; located in the =

southeastern quadrant.&nbsp; Both JTWC and MFR upped their<BR>&nbsp; =
respective=20
MSW estimates to 55 kts at 0600 UTC 8 March.&nbsp; Diwa by =
this<BR>&nbsp; time=20
was tracking southeastward at 15 kts along the southwestern<BR>&nbsp; =
periphery=20
of a mid-level ridge to the east.&nbsp; The tropical storm was<BR>&nbsp; =

beginning to interact with a baroclinic zone to the south, but=20
enhanced<BR>&nbsp; poleward outflow was leading to an increase in=20
convection.&nbsp; Based upon<BR>&nbsp; MFR's analysis, Severe Tropical =
Storm=20
Diwa reached its peak intensity<BR>&nbsp; of 60 kts (10-min avg) at =
08/1200 UTC=20
while centered approximately<BR>&nbsp; 475 nm south-southeast of Reunion =

Island.&nbsp;&nbsp; MFR maintained Diwa at<BR>&nbsp; 60 kts for the next =
warning=20
at 1800 UTC, but JTWC issued their final<BR>&nbsp; warning at that time, =
deeming=20
extratropical transition to be well<BR>&nbsp; under way and estimating =
the=20
intensity at only 35 kts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Six hours later<BR>&nbsp; MFR =
classified=20
Diwa as a 55-kt extratropical storm but continued to<BR>&nbsp; issue =
warnings=20
for the next 36 hours as ex-Diwa continued to track off <BR>&nbsp; into =
the=20
subtropical South Indian Ocean.&nbsp; The final MFR warning, =
issued<BR>&nbsp; at=20
10/1200 UTC, placed a weakening 40-kt center a little more =
than<BR>&nbsp; 1300=20
nm southeast of Reunion Island.</DIV>

were issued for the<BR>&nbsp; western Pilbara region and for upper =
western=20
coastal areas of Western<BR>&nbsp; Australia as Floyd approached, but =
the system=20
weakened and remained<BR>&nbsp; offshore and did not impact coastal =
parts.&nbsp;=20
Floyd did have an economic<BR>&nbsp; impact as some resource companies =
evacuated=20
offshore oil and gas<BR>&nbsp; installations.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR>&nbsp; B. Origins and Synoptic History<BR>&nbsp;=20
-------------------------------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tropical LOW developed on 18 March south =
of the=20
Indonesian island<BR>&nbsp; of Sumba and moved to the west to southwest, =

gradually strengthening.<BR>&nbsp; The LOW is estimated to have reached =
cyclone=20
intensity around 2100 UTC<BR>&nbsp; on 20 March while located roughly =
450 nm=20
west-northwest of Cape<BR>&nbsp; Leveque.&nbsp; The moderate easterly =
shear on=20
the 21st gradually eased and<BR>&nbsp; Floyd developed rapidly later on =
the=20
22nd, reaching Category 3 (65 kts)<BR>&nbsp; intensity around 23/0000 =
UTC while=20
located about 560 nm north-northwest<BR>&nbsp; of Exmouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; =
Infrared=20
satellite imagery on the 22nd had revealed very<BR>&nbsp; cold cloud =
tops.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severe Tropical Cyclone Floyd reached its =
maximum=20
intensity of 105 kts<BR>&nbsp; at 24/0000 UTC, centred approximately 530 =
nm=20
northwest of Exmouth.&nbsp; The<BR>&nbsp; cyclone at the time was making =
a turn=20
to the south due to the approach<BR>&nbsp; of a mid-latitude =
trough.&nbsp; The=20
eye of the system was very small with a<BR>&nbsp; diameter of about =
10-15 nm,=20
and the minimum CP was estimated at 915 hPa.<BR>&nbsp; JTWC's peak 1-min =
avg MSW=20
was a comparable 115 kts, and hurricane-force<BR>&nbsp; winds extended =
outward=20
from the center only about 20 nm.&nbsp;&nbsp; Arguably<BR>&nbsp; Floyd =
may have=20
reached Category 5 intensity on the basis of an infrared<BR>&nbsp; image =
at=20
23/2330 UTC showing a Data T-number of 6.5.&nbsp; However, =
images<BR>&nbsp; at=20
23/2130 and 24/0130 UTC showed Data T-numbers of only 5.5 and =
5.0,<BR>&nbsp;=20
respectively.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Floyd slowly weakened as it moved on a=20
southeasterly track towards the<BR>&nbsp; northwestern coastline of =
Western=20
Australia.&nbsp; Microwave imagery showed<BR>&nbsp; that Floyd underwent =
an=20
eyewall replacement cycle on the 24th,<BR>&nbsp; culminating around =
25/0000=20
UTC.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cyclone's intensity at that time<BR>&nbsp; was =
still=20
estimated at 90 kts, but Floyd continued to weaken more =
rapidly<BR>&nbsp;=20
thereafter as it encountered increasing upper-level =
northwesterlies.&nbsp;=20
The<BR>&nbsp; storm reached a point about 155 nm northwest of Exmouth at =
26/1200=20
UTC,<BR>&nbsp; but had encountered cooler SSTs and strong upper-level=20
winds.&nbsp; A post-<BR>&nbsp; cyclone analysis revealed that likely =
winds were=20
below gale force by<BR>&nbsp; 26/1800 UTC, but operationally Floyd was=20
maintained as a tropical cyclone<BR>&nbsp; until 0200 UTC on the 27th =
when it=20
was downgraded to a tropical LOW.<BR>&nbsp; A QuikScat image at 26/0925 =
UTC had=20
indicated that peak winds were barely<BR>&nbsp; of gale =
force.&nbsp;&nbsp; The=20
final advice, issued at 27/0200 UTC, placed the<BR>&nbsp; center of the =
former=20
tropical cyclone to the west-northwest of Exmouth,<BR>&nbsp; near=20
20.9N/111.6E.&nbsp; The remnant LOW continued to drift southwards =
off<BR>&nbsp;=20
the Western Australian coast for a few more days.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp; A. Introduction and Storm Origins<BR>&nbsp;=20
---------------------------------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glenda was a severe tropical cyclone which =

followed closely on the<BR>&nbsp; heels of Floyd in waters off Western=20
Australia.&nbsp; Whereas Floyd dissipated<BR>&nbsp; offshore, Glenda =
made=20
landfall near Onslow as a Category 3 cyclone<BR>&nbsp; (Australian =
scale) with=20
peak 10-min avg winds estimated near 95 kts.<BR>&nbsp; The storm had =
peaked a=20
couple of days earlier as a Category 5 cyclone but<BR>&nbsp; fortunately =

weakened some as it approached the coast.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glenda had its origins over the Northern=20
Territory.&nbsp; On 20 March a<BR>&nbsp; 1004-hPa tropical LOW was =
located over=20
the Top End near Katherine.&nbsp; This<BR>&nbsp; LOW subsequently moved =
westward=20
and by early on the 22nd had moved out<BR>&nbsp; over the Joseph =
Bonaparte Gulf=20
about 55 nm west of Port Keats.&nbsp; BoM<BR>&nbsp; Darwin initiated =
tropical=20
cyclone advices on the developing system at<BR>&nbsp; 2130 UTC on 23 =
March with=20
the LOW centered on the coast about 45 nm<BR>&nbsp; east-northeast of=20
Wyndham.&nbsp; The LOW moved very slowly for a couple of<BR>&nbsp; days, =

remaining in the extreme southern portion of the Joseph =
Bonaparte<BR>&nbsp; Gulf=20
before commencing a westerly heading which took it inland across =
the<BR>&nbsp;=20
extreme northeastern portion of Western Australia.&nbsp;&nbsp;=20
Environmental<BR>&nbsp; conditions were very favorable for =
intensification with=20
a developing<BR>&nbsp; anticyclone over the disturbance, providing low =
vertical=20
shear and<BR>&nbsp; good radial outflow.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emerging into the Timor Sea on 26 March, =
the LOW=20
began to slowly<BR>&nbsp; strengthen and BoM Perth began issuing =
shipping=20
warnings at 26/1500 UTC.<BR>&nbsp; The system was then centered =
approximately=20
200 nm northeast of Broome<BR>&nbsp; and moving west-southwestward at =
about 4=20
kts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Associated convection<BR>&nbsp; continued to =
consolidate and=20
JTWC issued their first warning on TC-20S<BR>&nbsp; at 27/0000 =
UTC.&nbsp; Three=20
hours later, Perth upgraded the system to Tropical<BR>&nbsp; Cyclone =
Glenda,=20
centered about 140 nm north of Derby and moving westward<BR>&nbsp; at 5=20
kts.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><BR>&nbsp; B. Synoptic History<BR>&nbsp; -------------------</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once named as a cyclone, Glenda =
intensified very=20
rapidly.&nbsp; At 27/1200<BR>&nbsp; UTC, only nine hours after being =
upgraded,=20
Glenda had reached severe<BR>&nbsp; tropical cyclone (i.e., hurricane) =
status=20
with 65-kt winds.&nbsp; The storm<BR>&nbsp; embarked on a =
west-southwesterly=20
track which gradually became more<BR>&nbsp; southwesterly.&nbsp;&nbsp;=20
Environmental conditions were very favorable for<BR>&nbsp; =
intensification and=20
Glenda continued to strengthen, reaching its peak<BR>&nbsp; intensity of =
115 kts=20
at 28/1200 UTC while centered about 245 nm north-<BR>&nbsp; northeast of =
Port=20
Hedland, moving southwestward at 10 kts.&nbsp; (JTWC's<BR>&nbsp; peak =
1-min avg=20
MSW was 140 kts at 28/1200 UTC.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Glenda's =
estimated<BR>&nbsp; lowest=20
CP was 910 hPa.&nbsp; The storm was being steered by a 500-mb =
ridge<BR>&nbsp; to=20
the southwest over Australia, and as a mid-latitude trough over =
the<BR>&nbsp;=20
west coast of Australia began to create a weakness in the ridge, =
the<BR>&nbsp;=20
cyclone turned to a more southwesterly track toward the =
northwestern<BR>&nbsp;=20
coastline of Western Australia.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately Glenda's strength began to ebb =
as the=20
dangerous storm<BR>&nbsp; neared the coast.&nbsp;&nbsp; By 0800 UTC on =
30 March=20
the center of Severe<BR>&nbsp; Tropical Cyclone Glenda was beginning to =
cross=20
the coastline between<BR>&nbsp; Onslow and Dampier.&nbsp; The CP was =
then=20
estimated at 930 hPa and peak<BR>&nbsp; gusts near the center were =
estimated at=20
135 kts, which translates into<BR>&nbsp; a 10-min mean wind of 95 =
kts.&nbsp; At=20
30/1200 UTC Glenda's center was<BR>&nbsp; located only 20 km east of =
Onslow and=20
moving south-southwestward at<BR>&nbsp; 11 kts.&nbsp; Once inland =
Glenda's track=20
became more southerly with hints<BR>&nbsp; of a recurvature to the=20
south-southeast by the time the final advice<BR>&nbsp; was issued at =
31/0300=20
UTC.&nbsp; As is typical with landfalling tropical<BR>&nbsp; cyclones, =
Glenda=20
began to quickly weaken after the center had moved<BR>&nbsp; =
inland.&nbsp; The=20
final BoM advice placed the center of the former tropical<BR>&nbsp; =
cyclone=20
about 250 km south-southeast of Exmouth with a MSW of 30 kts.<BR>&nbsp;=20
(Interestingly, JTWC issued their final warning on Glenda with =
the<BR>&nbsp;=20
center barely inland and with the MSW (1-min avg) estimated at 90 =
kts.)</DIV>

EXTRA FEATURE</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to shorten the amount of typing =
in=20
preparing the narrative<BR>&nbsp; material, I have been in the habit of =
freely=20
using abbreviations and<BR>&nbsp; acronyms.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried to =
define=20
most of these with the first usage<BR>&nbsp; in a given summary, but I =
may have=20
missed one now and then.&nbsp; Most of<BR>&nbsp; these are probably =
understood=20
by a majority of readers but perhaps a<BR>&nbsp; few aren't clear to =
some.&nbsp;=20
To remedy this I developed a Glossary of<BR>&nbsp; Abbreviations and =
Acronyms=20
which I first included in the August, 1998<BR>&nbsp; summary.&nbsp; I =
don't=20
normally include the Glossary in most months in<BR>&nbsp; order to help =
keep=20
them from being too long.&nbsp; If anyone would like to<BR>&nbsp; =
receive a copy=20
of the Glossary, please e-mail me and I'll be happy<BR>&nbsp; to send =
them a=20
copy.</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp; AUTHOR'S NOTE:&nbsp; This summary should be considered a =
very=20
preliminary <BR>&nbsp; overview of the tropical cyclones that occur in =
each=20
month. The cyclone<BR>&nbsp; tracks (provided separately) will generally =
be=20
based upon operational<BR>&nbsp; warnings issued by the various tropical =
cyclone=20
warning centers.&nbsp; The<BR>&nbsp; information contained therein may =
differ=20
somewhat from the tracking and<BR>&nbsp; intensity information obtained =
from a=20
"best-track" file which is based<BR>&nbsp; on a detailed post-seasonal =
analysis=20
of all available data. Information<BR>&nbsp; on where to find official=20
"best-track" files from the various warning<BR>&nbsp; centers will be =
passed=20
along from time to time.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The track files are not being sent via =
e-mail.&nbsp;=20
They can be retrieved<BR>&nbsp; from the archive sites listed =
