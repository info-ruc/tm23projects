Hi Dennis,
I am not Jonathan, you have e-mailed me presumably from the DMDX server
list. But i can help. I am a psyc phd at Melboure University.
In order to allow for vaiable reading time you can do it by inserting an
instruction to keypress to continue after reading time
0 "";
 0 means that it is not an experimental item and "" means blank screen
display. If you have <id "keyboard"> or <id "mouse> in  the first syntax
line, and a really long timeout value, sat t 40000 then you can have time
enough to read instructions and keypress to continue. I hope this helps. Yo
could send me the first few lines of syntax. Feel free to e-mail any furthe=
r
questions, or post it to Jonathan on the server List,
best regards,
Libby Thomas
