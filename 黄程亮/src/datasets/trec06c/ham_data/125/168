TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION
NWS TPC/NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL
805 AM EDT SUN MAY 21 2006

TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION FOR NORTH AMERICA...CENTRAL 
AMERICA...THE GULF OF MEXICO...THE CARIBBEAN SEA...NORTHEASTERN 
SECTIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA...AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE 
AFRICAN COAST FROM THE EQUATOR TO 32N. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION 
IS BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WEATHER OBSERVATIONS...RADAR... 
AND METEOROLOGICAL ANALYSIS.

BASED ON 0600 UTC SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THROUGH 
1015 UTC.

..TROPICAL WAVES...
TROPICAL WAVE IS ALONG 27W S OF 7N MOVING W 15 KT. THIS 
LOW-LATITUDE WAVE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE ITCZ. THERE IS SOME 
CYCLONIC TURNING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WAVE BUT IT IS RATHER 
BROAD AND LESS DISCERNIBLE THAN YESTERDAY. THE WAVE WILL LIKELY 
REMAIN ILL DEFINED AS IT MOVES WESTWARD IN A DRY ENVIRONMENT.

TROPICAL WAVE IS ALONG 52W S OF 7N MOVING W 15-20 KT. THIS WAVE 
STILL HAS SOME SIGNATURE OF AN INVERTED V-PATTERN EMBEDDED 
WITHIN THE ITCZ. MUCH OF THE WAVE IS NOW INLAND OVER S AMERICA. 
SCATTERED MODERATE CONVECTION IS WITHIN 180 NM W OF THE WAVE 
AXIS FROM 5N-8N. WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TSTMS ARE 
ELSEWHERE. LITTLE IMPACT IS EXPECTED IN THE CARIBBEAN FROM THIS 
WAVE OVER THE NEXT 3-5 DAYS AS THE MAJORITY OF THE MOISTURE IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE ACROSS S AMERICA.

TROPICAL WAVE ALONG 87W S OF 13N MOVING W 10-15 KT. THIS WAVE IS 
MAINLY IN THE EPAC BUT ITS NORTHERN EXTENSION LIES OVER CENTRAL 
AMERICA. A WEAK BROAD 1009 MB LOW HAS DEVELOPED ALONG THE WAVE 
AXIS NEAR 9N. THE WAVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH STRONG SWLY FLOW AND 
A SFC TROUGH IS PRODUCING CLUSTERS OF SCATTERED MODERATE TO 
STRONG CONVECTION ACROSS THE SW CARIBBEAN AND CENTRAL AMERICA. 
THIS FEATURE IS NOT EXPECTED TO BECOME MUCH BETTER DEFINED OVER 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS MOVES FURTHER W ACROSS THE EPAC.
 
..ITCZ...
ITCZ AXIS IS CENTERED ALONG 10N13W 3N25W 2N40W 4N51W. SCATTERED 
MODERATE CONVECTION IS WITHIN 120 NM EITHER SIDE OF THE AXIS 
BETWEEN 20W-28W ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL WAVE ALONG 27W. 
SIMILAR CONVECTION IS WITHIN 120 NM N OF THE AXIS BETWEEN 
32W-41W. SCATTERED SHOWERS/ISOLATED TSTMS ARE W OF 46W WITHIN 
180 NM EITHER SIDE OF THE AXIS ENHANCED BY THE TROPICAL WAVE 
ALONG 52W.  

..DISCUSSION...
GULF OF MEXICO...
QUIET WEATHER CONTINUES ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA AS A 1017 MB 
HIGH PRES SYSTEM REMAINS CENTERED IN THE E GULF NEAR 27N86W. 
IN THE UPPER LEVELS...UPPER TROUGH EXTENDS FROM A SMALL UPPER 
LOW OVER N MEXICO NEAR 25N98W EWD TO NORTHERN FLORIDA. STRONG 
SUBSIDENCE AND ASSOCIATED DRY/STABLE AIR ALOFT ACCOMPANIES THE 
TROUGH DUE TO UPPER LEVEL CONFLUENCE KEEPING SKIES FAIR TO 
MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE N GULF. BROKEN MID-HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS 
IS STREAMING NEWARD FROM S MEXICO TO S FLORIDA DRIVEN BY A JET 
STREAM BRANCH ON THE W PERIPHERY OF AN UPPER ANTICYCLONE IN THE 
CARIBBEAN. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE GULF FOR 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS...HOWEVER TROPICAL MOISTURE ACROSS THE NW 
CARIBBEAN WILL PUSH FURTHER NORTH AND BEGIN TO INFLUENCE THE 
SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE GULF LATER TODAY...AND POSSIBLE BECOME 
MORE WIDESPREAD OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN GULF ON MON/TUES.

CARIBBEAN SEA AND ATLANTIC OCEAN W OF 55W...
AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH/RIDGE PATTERN REMAINS IN PLACE ACROSS THIS 
AREA. THE DEEP-LAYERED TROUGH COVERS THE N GULF AND W ATLC N OF 
28N. AT THE SURFACE...THE FRONT HAS WEAKENED TO A TROUGH IN THE 
DISCUSSION AREA AND EXTENDS FROM 32N58W SWARD TO THE BAHAMAS 
NEAR 23N75W THEN CONTINUES SSWWARD INTO THE W CARIBBEAN TO NEAR 
NICARAGUA. BROKEN TO OVERCAST MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS ALONG 
WITH WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TSTMS ARE WITHIN 90 
NM EITHER SIDE OF THE TROUGH N OF 23N. CLUSTERS OF STRONG 
TSTMS ARE OVER THE W CARIBBEAN WITHIN 180 NM W OF THE TROUGH 
AXIS S OF 22N.  FARTHER E...A MID/UPPER HIGH IS LOCATED JUST N 
OF HAITI NEAR 21N72W WITH RIDGING EXTENDING SW TO HONDURAS AND 
NE TO BEYOND 32N50W. A 60-80 KT SWLY JET STREAM IS RIDING OVER 
THE THE UPPER ANTICYCLONE AND EXTENDS FROM THE E BAY OF CAMPECHE 
NORTHEASTWARD T0 S FLORIDA AND CONTINUES NEWARD BEYOND 32N58W. 
WINDS IN THE RANGE OF 60-80 KT ARE NOTED WITHIN THIS JET MAINLY 
W OF 65W. STRONG SUBSIDENCE IS ENCOMPASSING MUCH OF THE 
CARIBBEAN S OF 19N AND CURRENTLY E OF 82W...PUSHING WWARD. 
TRADEWINDS ARE GENERALLY IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE E OF 
80W...LIGHTER WINDS W OF THERE DUE TO THE WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE. 
TRADES WILL BECOME MORE UNIFORM AND INCREASE SLIGHTLY AS THE 
CNTRL ATLC SFC RIDGE EDGES A LITTLE CLOSER. MOISTURE RELATED TO 
THE SURFACE TROUGH WILL MOVE WWD TOWARDS THE YUCATAN LATER TODAY 
AND WILL LIKELY AFFECT THE NW CARIBBEAN AND THE W ATLC OVER THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS. THE LARGE VOLCANIC ASH CLOUDS DETECTED YESTERDAY 
OVER THE E CARIBBEAN DUE TO AN ERUPTION OF THE MONTSERRAT 
VOLCANO SAT MORNING IS STILL EVIDENT ON SATELLITE IMAGERY BUT IS 
BREAKING UP FROM 66W-72W FROM 12N-17N.
 
THE REMAINDER OF ATLANTIC OCEAN...
A SHARP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS OVER THE CNTRL ATLC WITH THE AXIS 
EXTENDING THRU 30N44W THROUGH AN UPPER LOW NEAR 21N48W AND INTO 
THE DEEP TROPICS NEAR 10N54W. THE UPPER LOW IS HELPING TO 
TRANSPORT UPPER MOISTURE FROM THE DEEP TROPICS NEWARD WITHIN 180 
NM TO THE RIGHT OF A LINE ALONG 10N50W 20N44W 28N40W. AN UPPER 
HIGH IS NEAR 16N32W WITH MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING COVERING THE 
AREA S OF 17N AND E OF 37W. DIFFLUENCE S OF THE RIDGE IS 
ENHANCING ITCZ CONVECTION. AN UPPER TROUGH IS MOVING SE OVER 
EXTREME NW AFRICA. THIS TROUGH IS CARRYING MOISTURE FROM THE 
UPPER TROUGH IN THE CENTRAL ATLC RIDING OVER THE UPPER HIGH INTO 
W AFRICA. AT THE SFC...A STRONG SPRAWLING 1027 MB HIGH CENTERED 
NEAR 31N36W COVERS THE ENTIRE REGION SUPPLYING FAIR WEATHER 
ACROSS A GOOD PORTION OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. TRADE WINDS ARE 
RATHER STRONG ACROSS THE AREA AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN THAT WAY 
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
