   As I was testing a LCD display (alternatively called an TFT or Flat 
Panel display) here I came across another previously unconsidered dimension 
of them that is a very serious consideration in their use as tachistoscopic 
display devices.  And that is that the LCDs all have a digital signal 
processor (DSP) in them sitting between the computer's output and the 
pixels of the display and the speed of that processor can interfere with 
tachistoscopic displays.  For instance when I first started testing this 
LCD the script I chose was using a 1024x768 display mode whereas the native 
resolution of this panel is 1600x1200.  So the DSP has to take the 1024x768 
signal and stretch it onto the 1600x1200 array of pixels that actually 
constitutes the display.  It turns out that this device can't keep up with 
even a moderately fast tachistoscopic display and was producing tearing at 
even pedestrian 4 tick displays.  I was toggling the background color 
between black and white and despite DMDX detecting no display errors I 
could plainly see tearing on the display.  Once I realized what was up and 
switched DMDX to using the native resolution of the panel the tearing went 
away.

   So one must be very careful to use the native resolution of an LCD when 
using DMDX.

   A further consideration that hasn't been tested yet but is likely to be 
the case is that my monitor is using a DVI cable and not the old 15 pin 
analog VGA cable that most displays are using.  The DVI cable is used here 
because high resolution displays (ie 1600x1200 and beyond) start to jitter 
and have all sorts of nasty problems.  Because the same DSP mentioned above 
has to take the analog video signal and process it it stands a very good 
chance of running into the same problems mentioned above.  So even if 
someone was using the native resolution of the panel the use of an analog 
signal cable could very well introduce the same sorts of tearing problems.

   Fortunately this is relatively easy to detect without additional test 
equipment beyond the human eye.  Basically toggle the background color at a 
rate DMDX can handle without display errors and you should see an even 
flickering display.  If you see periodic horizontal discontinuities then 
your LCD has a problem.
