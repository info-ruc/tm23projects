				<h1>Dear Customer</h1>
				<p>Dear Falk Customer,</p>
				<p>Well, last month I promised that this month�s letter would be about ACCOUNTABILITY, and we had many examples of that this month. Of course, the team of more than 50 of your fellow employees that worked on the Falk transaction was certainly accountable, as they managed to close the deal, create robust communications and migration plans, and ensure that everything went smoothly � often while staying up until after sunrise. </p>
				<p>We talked about the DART Search launch on our last employee call. As a follow-up, here are some of the great things that have happened because of the launch events and activities that we reviewed</p>
