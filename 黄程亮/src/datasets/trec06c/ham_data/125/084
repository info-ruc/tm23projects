> I have a question. Is it possible to run an experiment continuously, using
<cr>, but make it so the participant can read the instructions at their own
pace? I am going to be working with both young children and adults, and what
may be too quick for the children may be too long for the adults. Is this
possible?

	Two things.  First, <cr> is automatically canceled once you hit an
instruction (signaled by an item number of zero).  Thus:

+001 * "item1";
+002 * "item2";
+003 * "item3";
0 "Take a break (press the spacebar to continue).";

Items 1, 2, and 3 would be continuously displayed, but the program would
halt once the instruction was displayed.  The subject needs to restart the
sequence by pressing the Request key (the spacebar in this example).

	Second, in the above example, the target will stay on the screen
until a response is made, or the timelimit expires (the default is 4 secs).

	--k.i.f.
