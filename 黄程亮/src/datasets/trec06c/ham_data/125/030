CS352-ers,

I have posted the final grades on the e-gradebook - you should be able 
to see your grade by logging in.

I have also posted the final exam distribution at: 
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/cs352/handouts/final_exam.pdf 
(there is also a link from the course home page).  Sorry about the 
delay.  The median was 106 and the top score was 141 (out of 154).

We have graded the final projects, but I do not plan on posting the 
final project grades (these are letter grades) on the e-gradebook.  We 
used several test configurations and trace files to test how well your 
simulator handled different capacities, block sizes and 
associativities. We also evaluated your code, experimental results, and 
writeup. Here is a rough breakdown on how these were graded:

A = Passes all test cases, writeup is good, experiments are complete
B = Passes most test cases (but not all), may incorrectly flag errors 
on some traces, may be missing experiments
C = Passes few test cases, missing or incomplete experiments
F = no sign of life or any correct results
Zero = nothing turned in

I'm sorry to be harsh, but you are upper division CS students and 
programs that do nothing useful do not deserve passing grades.

Starting at noon tomorrow (Tuesday May 16) you may come collect your 
project writes-ups and look at your final exams and the solution set.  
Some ground rules:

1) You may take your project reports with you. They have the letter 
grades on them, but we have not written very many comments on the 
report papers. Please note that this does not mean we didn't read them 
(we did!).

2) You may look at your final exam and the final exam solution set, but 
you may not take either of them with you.  I need to keep your exams on 
file.

I sincerely hope you learned a lot in CS 352 (I think you did).  Best 
of luck for the future!

Cheers,
