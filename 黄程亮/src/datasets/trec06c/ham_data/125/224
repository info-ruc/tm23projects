I am running a script which plays a series of short sound files. After each 
file is played the listener has to make a judgement and the next sound file 
is then played.

When some of the sound files are played a short blip-type noise is heard at 
the beginning of the file which interferes with the stimulus. I have 
re-checked my sound files and there are no such noises in the actual wav 
files so I presume the blips are being created when the files are played 
through DMDX. Has anyone encountered similar problems? Would changing the 
way in which I present the files improve things or could it be something to 
do with the sound card in the pc?

This is a line from my script:

+1 <wav 2> "misC1d.wav" * / "a i			e i" /;

Any suggestions greatly appreciated!
