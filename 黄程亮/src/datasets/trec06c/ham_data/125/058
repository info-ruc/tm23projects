Maybe.  If the work which draws upon a public domain work has
sufficient originality in whatever is done using the prior work, the
second work can indeed have a copyright.  I can take a work in the
public domain, such as the Mona Lisa, and put a Star Wars background
behind her and have a copyrighted work.  Of course I would not thereby
get a copyright in the original Mona Lisa -- it would still be in the
public domain.  And unless I had permission to do so, or my use was
"fair use" I would be infringing Star Wars copyrights.  But my work
combining those two elements would be sufficiently original (not very
original or creative, but the threshold is low) to have a copyright.

You are correct.  But the problem of the work based on a public domain
work effectively removing the prior work from the public domain can be
a tough one -- sometimes the second work would seem to result in a
re-copyright of the original.  In such cases the courts will tend to
not allow the copyright in the second work.

If you copied the company's copyrighted work, you would be infringing.
 If both you and the company independently created similar or even
identical works from the public domain sources, you would both have
independent copyrights (assuming sufficient originality as noted
above), and neither would be infringing the other.

yes.  See above.

this is in fact a real concern in the digital age.  But the thing that
was in the public domain still is and can be copied by others.

Largely true.

BTW, much of what people think of as copyright-free clip art is not
really free of copyright.  The clip art has a copyright, but the owner
of the copyright licenses the use of it to anyone who owns an
authorized copy of it.  The license may in fact extend to creating
derivative works.
