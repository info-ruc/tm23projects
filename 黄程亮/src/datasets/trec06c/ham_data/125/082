Hi,thank you for your previous help. I have been able to get a number of test
runs of DMDX running with various stimuli. I have a question. Is it possible to
run an experiment continuously, using <cr>, but make it so the participant can
read the instructions at their own pace? I am going to be working with both
young children and adults, and what may be too quick for the children may be
too long for the adults. Is this possible?
Thank you,
