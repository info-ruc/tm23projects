TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION
NWS TPC/NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER MIAMI FL
205 AM EDT SUN MAY 21 2006

TROPICAL WEATHER DISCUSSION FOR NORTH AMERICA...CENTRAL 
AMERICA...THE GULF OF MEXICO...THE CARIBBEAN SEA...NORTHEASTERN 
SECTIONS OF SOUTH AMERICA...AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE 
AFRICAN COAST FROM THE EQUATOR TO 32N. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION 
IS BASED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY...WEATHER OBSERVATIONS...RADAR... 
AND METEOROLOGICAL ANALYSIS.

BASED ON 0000 UTC SURFACE ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THROUGH 
0500 UTC.

..TROPICAL WAVES...
TROPICAL WAVE IS ALONG 25W S OF 7N MOVING W 15 KT. THIS 
LOW-LATITUDE WAVE IS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE ITCZ AXIS. THERE IS 
STILL SOME CYCLONIC TURNING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WAVE BUT IT IS 
RATHER BROAD AND LESS DISCERNIBLE THAN YESTERDAY. THE WAVE WILL 
LIKELY REMAIN ILL DEFINED AS IT MOVES WESTWARD IN A DRY 
ENVIRONMENT NEAR THE NORTHERN EXTENSION OF THE WAVE.

TROPICAL WAVE IS ALONG 50W S OF 9N MOVING W 15-20 KT. THIS WAVE 
CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT AN INVERTED V-PATTERN EMBEDDED WITHIN THE 
ITCZ. MUCH OF THE WAVE IS NOW MOVING INLAND OVER S AMERICA. 
SCATTERED MODERATE/ISOLATED STRONG CONVECTION IS WITHIN 180 NM W 
OF THE WAVE AXIS FROM 5N-7N. WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED TSTMS ARE ELSEWHERE. LITTLE IMPACT IS EXPECTED IN THE 
CARIBBEAN FROM THIS WAVE OVER THE NEXT 3-5 DAYS AS THE MAJORITY 
OF THE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAVE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE 
ACROSS S AMERICA.

TROPICAL WAVE ALONG 86W S OF 13N MOVING W 10-15 KT. THE WAVE IS 
MAINLY IN THE EPAC BUT ITS NORTHERN EXTENSION LIES OVER CENTRAL 
AMERICA. SOME SLIGHT CURVATURE IS EVIDENT ON SATELLITE IMAGERY 
NEAR THE AXIS. A 1009 MB LOW HAS DEVELOPED JUST TO THE WAVE 
AXIS. THIS WAVE IN CONJUNCTION WITH STRONG SWLY FLOW AND A SFC 
TROUGH IS PRODUCING CLUSTERS OF SCATTERED MODERATE TO STRONG 
CONVECTION ACROSS THE SW CARIBBEAN AND CENTRAL AMERICA. WAVE IS 
NOT EXPECTED TO BECOME ANY BETTER DEFINED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE 
OF DAYS AS MOVES FURTHER W ACROSS THE EPAC.
 
..ITCZ...
ITCZ AXIS IS CENTERED ALONG 11N15W 4N25W 2N37W 4N51W. SCATTERED 
MODERATE CONVECTION IS WITHIN 120 NM EITHER SIDE OF THE AXIS 
BETWEEN 20W-27W ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL WAVE ALONG 25W. 
SIMILAR CONVECTION IS WITHIN 120 NM N OF THE AXIS BETWEEN 
31W-40W. SCATTERED SHOWERS/ISOLATED TSTMS ARE W OF 44W WITHIN 
180 NM EITHER SIDE OF THE AXIS ENHANCED BY THE TROPICAL WAVE 
ALONG 50W.  

..DISCUSSION...
GULF OF MEXICO...
PLEASANT WEATHER CONTINUES ACROSS THE GULF AS A 1017 MB HIGH 
PRES SYSTEM CENTERED 180 NM E OF TAMPA NEAR 27N86W DOMINATES. AS 
IN THE UPPER LEVELS...UPPER TROUGH EXTENDS FROM A SMALL UPPER 
LOW ABOVE N MEXICO NEAR 25N98W TO NORTHERN FLORIDA. STRONG 
SUBSIDENCE AND ASSOCIATED DRY/STABLE AIR ALOFT ACCOMPANIES THE 
TROUGH DUE TO UPPER LEVEL CONFLUENCE KEEPING SKIES FAIR TO 
MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE N GULF. BROKEN MID-HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS 
IS STREAMING NEWARD FROM S MEXICO TO S FLORIDA ON THE W 
PERIPHERY OF AN UPPER ANTICYCLONE IN THE CARIBBEAN. WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE GULF FOR THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS...HOWEVER TROPICAL MOISTURE ACROSS THE NW CARIBBEAN MAY 
PUSH FURTHER NORTH AND BEGIN TO INFLUENCE THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS 
OF THE GULF ON SUNDAY...AND POSSIBLE BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD OVER 
THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN GULF WITH TIME AS SUGGESTED BY COMPUTER 
MODELS.

CARIBBEAN SEA AND ATLANTIC OCEAN W OF 55W...
AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH/RIDGE PATTERN REMAINS IN PLACE ACROSS THIS 
AREA. AT THE SURFACE...THE FRONT HAS WEAKENED TO A TROUGH AND 
EXTENDS FROM 32N59W SWARD TO THE BAHAMAS NEAR 23N76W THEN 
CONTINUES SSWWARD INTO THE W CARIBBEAN TO NEAR NICARAGUA. BROKEN 
TO OVERCAST MOSTLY MID/HIGH CLOUDS ALONG WITH WIDELY SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TSTMS ARE WITHIN 180 NM SE OF THE TROUGH N 
OF 21N. CLUSTERS OF STRONG TSTMS ARE OVER THE W CARIBBEAN WITHIN 
120 NM W OF THE TROUGH AXIS S OF 21N.  FARTHER E...A MID/UPPER 
HIGH IS LOCATED JUST N OF HAITI NEAR 21N72W WITH RIDGING 
EXTENDING SW TO HONDURAS AND NE TO BEYOND 32N50W. A 60-80 KT 
SWLY JET STREAM IS RIDING OVER THE THE UPPER ANTICYCLONE AND 
EXTENDS FROM THE E BAY OF CAMPECHE NORTHEASTWARD T0 S FLORIDA 
AND CONTINUES NEWARD BEYOND 32N59W. WINDS IN THE RANGE OF 60-80 
KT ARE NOTED WITHIN THIS JET MAINLY W OF 65W. STRONG SUBSIDENCE 
IS ENCOMPASSING MUCH OF THE CARIBBEAN S OF 19N AND CURRENTLY E 
OF 82W...PUSHING WWARD. TRADEWINDS ARE GENERALLY IN THE 15-20 KT 
RANGE E OF 80W...LIGHTER WINDS W OF THERE DUE TO THE WEAKNESS IN 
THE RIDGE. TRADES WILL BECOME MORE UNIFORM AND INCREASE SLIGHTLY 
AS THE CNTRL ATLC SFC RIDGE CONTINUES TO NOSE CLOSER. MOISTURE 
RELATED TO THE SURFACE TROUGH WILL MOVE WWD TOWARDS THE YUCATAN 
TOMORROW AND WILL LIKELY AFFECT THE NW CARIBBEAN AND THE W ATLC 
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE LARGE VOLCANIC ASH CLOUDS EARLIER 
DETECTED OVER THE E CARIBBEAN DUE TO AN ERUPTION OF THE 
MONTSERRAT VOLCANO THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO BE SEEN ON 
SATELLITE IMAGERY FROM 12N-16N BETWEEN 65W-71W...MOVING SWWARD. 
SMALL ISOLATED SHOWERS AND TSTMS ARE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE ASH 
CLOUDS.
 
THE REMAINDER OF ATLANTIC OCEAN...
A SHARP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS OVER THE CNTRL ATLC WITH THE AXIS 
EXTENDING THRU 30N43W THROUGH AN UPPER LOW NEAR 22N48W AND INTO 
THE DEEP TROPICS NEAR 9N50W. THE UPPER LOW IS HELPING TO 
TRANSPORT UPPER MOISTURE FROM THE DEEP TROPICS NEWARD WITHIN 180 
NM TO THE RIGHT OF A LINE ALONG 10N50W 20N44W 28N40W. AN 
UPPER HIGH IS NEAR 16N31W WITH MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING COVERING 
THE AREA S OF 17N AND E OF 35W. DIFFLUENCE S OF THE RIDGE IS 
ENHANCING ITCZ CONVECTION. MODERATE/STRONG SUBSIDENCE COVERS THE 
AREA FROM 6N-17N E OF 35W. UPPER TROUGH IS MOVING SE OVER 
EXTREME NW AFRICA. THIS TROUGH IS CARRYING MOISTURE FROM THE 
UPPER TROUGH IN THE CENTRAL ATLC OVER THE UPPER HIGH INTO W 
AFRICA. AT THE SFC...A STRONG 1026 MB HIGH CENTERED NEAR 31N39W 
COVERS THE ENTIRE REGION SUPPLYING FAIR WEATHER ACROSS A GOOD 
PORTION OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. TRADE WINDS ARE RATHER STRONG 
ACROSS THE AREA AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN THAT WAY FOR THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS.
