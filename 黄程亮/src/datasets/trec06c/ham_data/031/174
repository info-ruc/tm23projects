Hi,

   this must have been asked before. But where can I get the TI SN754410
from On-line ordering if possible or a UK supplier.
   I managed burn one out  on my Handy Board at the weekend :o(  is
there a way to protect these chips from motors that take too much power?

   all help welcome

thanks

tone
