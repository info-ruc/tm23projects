The key is, knowing when to get on and when to get off a stock, for
successful day trading. CWTD has distinct patterns to watch for.


Yesterday CWTD volume spiked again 53%. Today we got word that there
will be more exciting news early next week. We are still hovering at
$1.98, up 48 cents since this climb began.


Take advantage of the current price on Monday, we expect to see it begin
climbing Monday and Tuesday in anticipation of the coming news that stirred
the market last week.


This ride is not over. Jump on now and ride the price up on the
highest return "Day Trade" we have featured this year.


Get on CWTD first thing Monday morning.
