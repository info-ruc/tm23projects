I own an handy-board now for 2 months and
I have now 2 GP2D02 connected to it. (took me 1 hour to hook them up and
test)
You need a digital output-pin(like one off the spi-pins) or
make use of the expansion-board, which has digital outputs.
I created my own expansion board with 16 digitial out, 16 analog in and 8
digital in.
I make use of a like wise pgm as found on:
http://arielle.informatik.uni-kl.de/Lehre/Praktikum/PSD-IC.html
Doing the High/Low setting of Vin is done differently than this example,
because
they use a peculiar, but interesting way of doing digital output.
When you are interested I can post you my source.

BTW the differences in readings on the same distance between the 2 PSDs is
quite large.
A reading on 50cm differs 16.
This means that when you are interested in the absolute distance, you need
to build specific
lookup tables per PSD.
