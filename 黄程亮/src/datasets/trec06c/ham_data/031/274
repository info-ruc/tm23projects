Subject: Scrolling through the LCD messages by the knob
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi,

i am looking for a program to use the knob for scrolling through
messages.
i really need this, because i have to output more than 32 chars (and
there isnt enough space for a larger display ).
i have read about using the knob for scrolling on the handyboard
website.

anyone already written such a program ?

Thanks, Simon
