thank you for the apt and quick reply. if you could tell us what is the
difference between a straight through cable and a null modem cable it would
be great( we are using a 25 female to 25 female connector) and how to
identify the difference between the RJ11 telephone and network cable. We
have checked the cable and it looks to be a 4 wire telephone cable since I
removed it from my telephone directly. Also, the handy board once connected
receives power form the charger board but does not enter BOOTSTRAP MODE. The
PWR and BATT led do not go on and off. But the yellow CHARGE LED on the
interface board keeps on switching if the hb is connected and then lights up
constantly when the STOP switch is pressed. Since, the bootstrap
configuration is not confirmed we cannot download the program: but on trying
the downloader it gives ERROR which might be due to cable fault as suggested
earlier.
Please help debug
thank you
