 hi
    i've recently modified the pcode.asm file to make the timer interrupt 
    occur at 2KHz, rather than 1KHz. does anyone know how i'm supposed
    to assemble/compile this pcode.asm file into the pcode_hb.s19 file
    that will be loaded into the Handyboard? if memory serves me correctly,
    there are specific assembly language compilers. can anyone recommend
    a good site to download such softwares?
