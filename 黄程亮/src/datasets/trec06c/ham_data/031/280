In the example, are there any advantages or disadvantages in using a voltage
regulator (such as a 7805) to dropping the voltage from 12v to 5v as opposed
to using a diode string?  

Also, I guess no one had an answer on the earlier question of running the HB
in a continuous-power mode (ie from a wall-wart).  I would be intersted in
knowing an answer to this as well if anyone has an idea.  If the HB was
constantly doing something (or at some frequency, I assume the trickle
charge mode would be good to keep the battery going.  But, I can't imagine
it would be good for the unit to sit on the charger idle for days at a time.

I apologize for having sent the following with extra line-feeds in it;
Here it is again:

The main problem I see is with how you label the voltages at various
points in the circuit.  If you have a 12 V battery, the low voltage end
is usually called zero volts and the high voltage end is called +12
volts (although the numbers are just relative to each other).  You show
-12 V at one end and +12 V at the other, which you could only get with a
24 V source (which wouldn't be appropriate).  Perhaps the following
would make more sense:
