I recently purchased the Handy Board 1.2 and am running the HC11E1FN.  I
also purchased the IC compiler from Newton Research Labs.  Everything worked
great.

I hooked up a hobby servo to PA7 and it ran well with the supplied c
routines.  However, after disconnecting the servo, when I tried to use PA7
to develop some sonar routines, it wouldn't respond to the following code:

Bit_set(0x1026, 0b10000000);
Bit_set(0x1000, 0b10000000);

I checked it with the vom and it stayed low the whole time even during
interactive commands.  Then I ran the testdigitals() function in the
hbtest.c set and the digital input 2 (starting with 0) would show logic 1
(active low) regardless of what I did.

Now this morning, when I turn on the power, all I get is a clicking sound
from the piezo speaker.

I have exhaustively looked for shorts and poor solders.  I have re-soldered
5 or 10 pins just to make sure.  I swapped out the 74HC244 to see if he was
the culprit, no avail.

Can anyone give me some steps from here?  Ask me some questions, I'm
stumped.

Thanks.
