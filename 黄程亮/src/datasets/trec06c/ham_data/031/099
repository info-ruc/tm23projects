Hi all

Iam thinking about making a six legged walking robot using servos and
wondered if anybody has already built one.
I want to use two servos per leg one for lifting and another for the
sweeping action so giving 12 in total. One thing i want to know is how do
you control twelve servos? i have seen some serial servo controllers that
control upto 256, is  it possible to control them with just the handyboard.
also does the HB have enough proccessing power to control all these servos
and still have enough spare for obstical avoidance etc.



Any thoughts, tips etc.

Thanks Russ....
