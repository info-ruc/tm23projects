Dear Friends,
	    We, at VESIT ,Bombay,India are making a rover which is capable
 of navigating itself and avoiding obstacles.For this,we are using the 
handy board.The soldering work has been completed and we are now trying to 
use 'download software' with it.
	    In the handy board assembly manual it has been said that 
inorder to check the charger/interfacing circuit, connect only the that 
circuit(charger/interfacer) without the handy board to the host computer 
using a appropriate modem cable (RS232).Then the charger/interface board
has to be powered causing the red LED(PWR) to glow. Next,the download 
software has to be run. At this stage the green LED on the board should
glow up indicating transmission of data (or readiness to transmit data).We
are finding that the green LED(SER) does not glow in our circuit.(please
refer to section 3.3.2 of the hba.pdf file for more explanation)
	    We are therefore unable to find whether this particular board 
is working and hence we cannot risk connecting the handy board to the 
charger/interfacer board.
	    Can someone please tell me what are the possible reasons causing
this to occur?Please reply as soon as possible as we have to begin testing
the program to run the rover.
							Yours Sincerely,
							    Nitin
