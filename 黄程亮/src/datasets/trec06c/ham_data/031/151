Hello,
	Does anyone here know how acceleration will affect the operaion of
a handyboard, and also will sudden changes in altitude (like, 3,000 feet
in less than ten seconds) affect it's operation? I have a High Power
Rocketry launch coming up in May, and I'm desinging a payload that will be
controlled/documented by my HB so I need to know how much the HB can take.

	And no, it is *not* a guided missile with a warhead!
