Timing 12 servos with the HB could be done. So far we are using 8 servos
which don't use much cpu resources at all. But 1 compare output can only
time 8 servos because of the servos timing requierments without using a lot
of cpu time. So a second compare output must be used for the other 4 servos.
But using a clever algorithm timing 12 servos could be done.
The biggest problem is to get all the contol algorithms to run for 12 servos
(12 axes) in realtime.
It could be done using multiple handyboards.

I'm very interested in your project, so please keep posting ideas and
information about your WALKER.
