The main problem I see is with how you label the voltages at various
points in the circuit.  If you have a 12 V battery, the low voltage end
is usually called zero volts and the high voltage end is called +12
volts (although the numbers are just relative to each other).  You show
-12 V at one end and +12 V at the other, which you could only get with a
24 V source (which wouldn't be appropriate).  Perhaps the following
would make more sense:

                                        +12V
