Has anyone ever created a generic expansion board for the HandyBoard?

What I mean by generic, is a board with say a .10 grid hole pattern and =
some power and ground traces .  A board or boards like this with custom =
circuitry, could be stacked on top of the handyboard. This would make =
adding widgets a snap.
