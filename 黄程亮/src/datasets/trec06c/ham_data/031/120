I want to program my  HB so that my robot will be able to navigate around obstacles. The navigation 
area is a rectangular area boarded by a silver duct tape. My robot shall not touch the tape. Does 
anyone have any idea of how I can implement this? What kind of sensor should I use so that my robot 
will stay within this rectangulaer area without touching the silver duct tape?
