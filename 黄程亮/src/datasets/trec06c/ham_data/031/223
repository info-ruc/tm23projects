The most common problems seem to be with the types of cables and the
serial port settings.  Make sure that you are using a straight through
cable (not a null modem cable) to connect the HB to the serial port, and
make sure that you have a telephone style RJ11 cable (not a network
style RJ11 cable) to connect the serial interface board to the HB.

Also, try to verify that your serial port is working properly.  If you
have multiple serial ports, try it on different ones (I had success with
one port, but not the other).  The following settings are ones that work
with my HB.

   Bits per second:  9600
   Data bits:        8
   Parity:           none
   Stop bits:        1
   Flow control:     Xon/Xoff

You say that you haven't yet tried connecting the HB to the serial
interface board.  Perhaps others on the mailing list can address whether
it would be too risky to simply try hooking up the HB at this point and
testing the whole system (despite the fact that the serial interface
board may not be working properly yet).  Since I'm not very smart about
electronics, I would probably just plug it all in and see if it smokes! 
;-)

Good luck.
