I ordered these sensors at Gleasonresearch in a sensor pack,
but where can i buy them without other stuff...
I need about 4 of these:
they look like this:
   ______
  /  __  \
 /  I__I  \
/__________\
  I I  I I
  I I  I I
  I I  I I
  I I  I I
  I I  I I

AND then i have an other question...
2 weeks ago i wrote a programm for the HB with a little LOOP
it worked fine, but after a while it stopped
and on the LCD-Display stood "RUNTIME ERR" or s.th. like this
then i did a BEEP(); into the LOOP und then it worked fine 
without this error... what could it be??
