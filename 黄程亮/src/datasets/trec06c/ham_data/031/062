Has anyone built robots for the trinity fire-fighting contest.  I would 
like to hear your design and what kind of major problems that you 
encountered in building it.  A website would be great.  The reason for my 
interest is that I need to include any "prior research" for my science 
project, because I built  a fire-fighting robot for school.  If you have a 
problem with me using your robot as discssion in my report please do not 
respond to this E-Mail.

Thanks in Advance
