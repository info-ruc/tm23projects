Russ,

This would not suffice.  The PCODE would need to be changed as well.

The end result of the motor interface routines in C in LIB_HB.C is that
RAM locations 0x0E, and 0x22-0x25 have the direction and speed pattern info
for each of the four motors.  The PCODE then apparently does the shifting of
the speed patterns through each of the motor ports synchronous to the 1ms 
interrupt.  

If you added the hardware for the additional motoros and butchered up the
LIB_HB.C routines to accommodate them, you'd still to have an interrupt
routine which would take the info for each of the new motors and shift 
them through at the 1ms rate.  

If you use the public domain IC, you could do this directly in the PCODE ASM
source file.  If you use the commercial IC 3.2, you'll have to write an ICB
file to handle it since the PCODE source is not available as far as I know.

Subject: Motor Ports


Hi all,

Is it possible to add more motor ports to the handy board by simply copying
the existing
motor drive circuit and putting them on the expansion header where the extra
chip select lines are.
if so what changes would be needed to make IC motor() functions control the
extra ports, and what
impact would this be on the CPU resources.

I need to control 12 individual motors and maybe 18 in the future.


Cheers Russ.....
