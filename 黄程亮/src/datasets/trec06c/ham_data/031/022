www. columbia-center.org/fascinating/index html    This company has a
intetresting "radar"  -ultrasonic in nature.  The software, I thought, was
especially interesting and adaptable to the handy board by some one a whole
lot cleverer than myself.

  Also some stepper motors at good prices  9 volts  $8      4-12 volts $13

  A web site well worth a visit
