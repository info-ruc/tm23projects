Hi all,

Is it possible to add more motor ports to the handy board by simply copying
the existing
motor drive circuit and putting them on the expansion header where the extra
chip select lines are.
if so what changes would be needed to make IC motor() functions control the
extra ports, and what
impact would this be on the CPU resources.

I need to control 12 individual motors and maybe 18 in the future.


Cheers Russ.....
