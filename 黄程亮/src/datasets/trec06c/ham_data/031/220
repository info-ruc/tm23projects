This can take a long time.
Start by making sure that the cable is correct. You can do this by
changing the Rx and Tx lines. If this does not help de Maxim serial
driver can be faulty. Last check the solder joints.I once looked at them
and could not see anything wrong. I reheated them with a soldering iron
and it worked.

Good luck
Ronald
