I believe the best thing to do is use separte controlers (e.g. PICs) to
control the specific motions of the servo's. This will allow you to have
more control over the HB. There are several places on the web (e.g.
http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/pic/  where you can find info on PIC's
including having them control servo's. I think the timing constraints on
12 servo's will heavily tax the HB resources.
