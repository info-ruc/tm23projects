Hi!

Some time ago i asked this question now i try again, maybe anybody can help
me!

I dowloaded the environment for the pc(dos) to assemble a s19-pcode file
for the hb.
Now i tried a little bit but it does now work,

What you can download under 

pcode for hb and makefile 
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/icsourc
e.html

and

ml

''as11_ic for MS-DOS. Compile ICB (Interactive C Binary driver) files on
your MS-DOS machine, using Kent Farnsworth's package of tools. The tools
allow you to assemble the pcode.s19 file (which runs on the Handy Board's
6811) as well as compile ICB files''

 seems not fit together. The pc package alone does work fine but i have no
rev22 board to test the s19.
If i use the pcode from above i does translate after some changed
equivalent to the ones in the pcode from the
pc-package. But this pcode.s19 does not boot correctly and cannot handle
the display.

I think there are three possibilities - the as11 does produce not the
correct code, the pcode is not correct or
i made a mistake in changing the hb pcode.

Has anybody a running hb pcode so i can sure that there is no error or does
anybody compile/assemble 
his own pcode with the pc-package?

Bye
Bernd
