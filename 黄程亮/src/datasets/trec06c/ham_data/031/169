Hi Philsky;

I've seen videos of some of these "serious amateur" rocket launches, and
from that I would say acceleration is your prime concern, followed by shock
and vibration.  I'm assuming you will substitute a lightweight 9V lithium
battery for the NiCd battery pack, and that you will remove the LCD and use
the "NoLCD" version of the P-code.

Beyond that, I would mount the thing flat so the G-forces won't tend to pull
the chips from their sockets, and you might want to consider soldering as
many of the external connections as possible, rather than relying on
connectors.  Go to an R/C shop and buy some of the foam rubber they sell
there specifically for protecting R/C receivers and wrap the HB with that.

Some additional considerations:  If you don't need the motor-driver or IR
features of the HB you might want to consider the Fingerboard, which is
basically a Handyboard without the peripherals (you can add whatever ports
etc. you actually need).  The Fingerboard is thus smaller and lighter,
however not any more shock or vibration resistant.  You could also "pot" the
HB (or the FB) with RTV silicone, but this makes parts replacement more
difficult, and won't dissipate heat.  You also might want to think up ways
to torture test your rig beforehand.  Tie it to a rope and twirl it round
your head?  Bungee drop it from a building?  Finally, if you plan to use R/C
or telemetry with this rocket, be aware that the HB generates a lot of RF
noise, so you  may have to experiment with shielding.  Dealing with EMI and
RFI is a black art, understood by few, and requires much experimenting.

I recently built a small data-logger using a Fingerboard wrapped in
fishpaper and R/C foam for use on mountain bikes and all-terrain-vehicles,
but weather has prevented any serious teating.  Preliminary tests were
promising, though.
