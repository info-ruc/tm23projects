The only problem with using individual servo control is speed, the time
it takes to move 12 servos by individual commands is rather long. This
has the effect of slowing the walker down considerably. A dedicated
controller such as the MSCC11 that I mentioned previously moves all the
servos at the same time thus increasing the movement speed (admittedly
this will probably not be very quick no matter what you use, I think I
worked it out to be approximately 2 mile per hour max but my maths could
be wrong).
