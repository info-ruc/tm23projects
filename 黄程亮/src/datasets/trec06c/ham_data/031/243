If you can't find the TI chip try doubling up on the L293D by piggybacking them
on top of each other for added amps. You can use one L293D with an additional
L293 on top of it (the 'D' has protection diodes that you MUST have). You may
need to provide motor power to the chip separately because the traces on the
Handyboard may not handle that much current (from a previous discussion, I do
not know firsthand)
