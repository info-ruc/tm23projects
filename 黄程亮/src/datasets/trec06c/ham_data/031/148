    Hello,
            I am investigating createing a wireless serial link between =
my PC and handyboard.  The cheapest solution I've found is the RF module =
from Lynxmotion.  Does anyone have any experience with this, or perhaps =
suggestions for simpler or more reliable solutions.  I found in the =
archives a mention of using a IrDa module from TI.  What is this?

    Thanks,
                Aaron

I too am interested in this;  I have been looking at the RF modules at =
http://www.linxtechnologies.com/ their modules are cheaper and offer a =
wider range of options.  They also have a sample application note that =
shows how to implement a simple packet based protocol with error =
correction.  The big problem with their setup is that you must purchase =
an expensive "evaluation" kit prior to placing orders for the real =
modules.  the modules are cheap; the eval kits have 2 RX / 2 TX modules, =
a development board, documentation.

Regards,
Mark Williamson
