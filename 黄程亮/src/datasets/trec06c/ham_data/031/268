I have Quick Time movies of my robot going about life!

Background:
	As a Masters student I created a mobile robot using the Handy 
Board.  Many of you may remeber me bugging you with questions.  :)  Well, 
that all payed off and I had a successful project and presentation.  
Thanks to all who helped!  I decided to document my work so that others 
may see and learn from it.  It took quite a while but finally...

	In the documentaion there are video demos of subsumption and 
robot fire-fighting mimicking the reknown Trinity College Fire Fighting 
Home Robot Contest.  Brief explanations of principles are included.

Enjoy!
