The other day I posted to this board that I was having downloading problems
with a HB which once had none.  Simon very kindly E-mailed me reminding me
about the proper phone cable.
  Seeing he was the only one-I-by necessity have become an expert.   Also-
seeing that no one else has ever had a problem judging by the response-I shall
gladly lend my expertise seeing that I must be the only one with experience in
this area if it should ever arise-which I could surmise is not often-which
would be wrong.         Cappy Anderson
