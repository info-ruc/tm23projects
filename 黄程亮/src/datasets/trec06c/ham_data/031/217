I obtained the RF wireless kit ( HP Series )  from Lynx Technologies a while
ago, and I have not had any success yet. My guess is that the handyboard is
unable to "Synchronize with the board" with the half- duplex communication
provided by the kit.
I contacted Lynx Technologies by e-mail about the application, and they
provided me with a tech support number. I plan to contact them as soon as
possible.
Meanwhile, I heard that somebody had already had success with the wireless
link using a kit by Radiometrix? I have lost the link to the site.
