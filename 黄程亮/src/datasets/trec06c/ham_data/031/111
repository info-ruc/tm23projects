Subject: New mail list for legged robots
X-Mailer: DMailWeb Web to Mail Gateway 2.0n, http://netwinsite.com/top_mail.htm
Message-Id: <36964543.2c42.0@wt.net>
X-User-Info: 149.58.101.253

I decided to jump off the deep end and have created a new mail list for anyone
interested in legged/walking robots regardless of CPU or "brain board". You
can join this list by sending a mail message to

      legged-robots-subscribe@egroups.com

or you can visit the site

      http://www.egroups.com/list/legged-robots/

This will be where the archive will reside.

An email message with instructions will be sent to you. Since this is a new
list I don't know how busy it will be but it should be interesting. I will forward
the last few messages from here that deal with this subject.

Mike
