not really.  you can issue serial line characters to the desktop PC
from the HB (see the FAQ), but IC cannot display them.

so, for interactive development, it won't work.  but if you can quit
IC and run a terminal emulator program on your PC (e.g.,
HyperTerminal, ZTerm), then it can be done.

see the FAQ:
