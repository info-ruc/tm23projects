Hi all, I am assembling a handyboard and things have gone well until I got
to the section 7.1.1 in the assembly manual. I assembled the digital
inputs, and when I used the function testdigitals(), the start button is
the only one that will register a 1 on the screen while testing all of the
inputs.  I have checked pin 9 of U6(74HC138) and it is stuck on logical
high rather than pulsing like it should be doing. Any suggesions?

Thanks in advance,

Owen Popplestone
