Yes, and it is totally trivial to do so.  I don't have my sources here at
the moment, but it is roughly like this:


c = readknob();  /* or whatever the cmd is for reading it */

if ( c < 64 )
{
  print "a";
}
else if ( c < 128 )
{
  print "b";
}
else if ( c < 192 )
{
  print "c";
}
else
{
  print "d";
}

or set a variable inside each if block and then run through a switch
statement later when you're doing your printing.

Sorry if my C is rusty.  I do too many languages nowadays...
