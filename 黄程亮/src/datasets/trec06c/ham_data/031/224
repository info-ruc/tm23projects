The interface charger board is soldered and the max232  chip has been tested
works perfectly and the green led SER glows on shorting the pind of max232
and the J3 socket. But when the host computer is connected and the proper
downloaded is connected it says that board not in proper mode. This is
justified as the board is not in bootstrap. But the green doesnt  glow at
all. What can be the error. We cheacked the connections, cable, the
downloader and everything else. cant find the fault please reply soon
