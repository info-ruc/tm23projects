try running the servo off of a separate power supply; e.g., 4 AA
cells.  you'd connect the servo red wire to the battery + lead, the servo
black wire to the battery - lead, and also connect the battery - lead
to the HB motor ground.

in general it is a bad idea to power a servo off of the HB's regulated
+5v supply.
