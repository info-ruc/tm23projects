Hi Everybody,

I'm trying to hook-up the Handy Board, an R/C car chassis, and a wireless camera
together, and here's what I was planning to do about the power...

				                        +---------------+

           |                            -12v   | | |    +---------------+    | |

1 - Is the whole thing correct, from an EE stand point ?
2 - Is there a problem in having a battery with far more Amps than necessary? 
3 - Could a battery with high Amperage "push" too much current ?
4 - Could the R/C DC motors draw too much current and "harm " the HB ?
5 - What kind of dynamo/combustion motor (r/c) size, combination would be
    necessary to feed a 12v in/out battery recharger (with auto trickle charge)?

Thank you in advance,

Andre Philippi.
