   There is a new DMDXPASS.ZIP on the website, this contains a passpoint 
version of DMDX.EXE -- you don't want to overwrite your old DMDX.EXE, this 
one is writing diagnostics to the disk constantly as it runs.  It will 
produce (and overwrite) a file call DMDXPASS.TXT, for those people having 
trouble with the digitalvox in DMDX 1.2.00 please email me 
(<jforster@psy1.psych.arizona.edu>, not the list) the resulting file after 
running your item file.  Hopefully you won't choke my psy1 email account.
