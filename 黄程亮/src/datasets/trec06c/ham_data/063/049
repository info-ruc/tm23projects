We're looking into buying a sonar ranging module from Acroname for use in our
lab. Does anyone reccomend a particular offering of theirs? If we buy this
unit:
     http://acroname.com/robotics/parts/R14-SONAR1.html
All we will have to do to connect it to the HandyBoard are the wiring steps
laid out on the official HandyBoard page, correct? Hopefully?

Thx!
