Hi,
	Just finished my exp board, checked over all connections twice and looked
for shorts, installed it, turned on the board and attempted to download the exp
libs. Wellll when I truned the board on the LCD was just squares across the top,
but the power light was on....tryed reintalling pcoder , no luck, so I removed
the exp and turned it back on with the LCD on the HB and it worked fine and
would talk to IC. Is there a special procedure for installing the Exp or and any
suggestions?HELP?

Thanx in advanve.-Alex
