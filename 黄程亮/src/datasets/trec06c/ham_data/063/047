Hi -

Claude Lyneis asked me to respond to your request for information about
beam time at the 88" Cyclotron.  We actually do quite a bit of work
using 55 MeV protons for the Atlas group here as well as a small amount
of work for a group working on a detector for Fermilab.  So far, we
haven't charged for the physics work, since it is for basic science, but
since our primary mission is for nuclear science research, the physics
tests get time at low priority, when it becomes available.  So if you
are flexible and don't need large chunks of time, I can probably squeeze
you in. We also use 55 MeV protons for some biology work and radiation
effects testing for industry, so it is running fairly often. If you
wanted to pay for beam time, your priority would leapfrog to near the
top, since we need all the income we can get. The charge for a
university would be $637./hr.  I usually schedule a minimum of 8 hrs,
but I don't charge for what isn't used. We do charge 2-4 hrs for tuning
the beam.

The proton beam can have an area of up to 4" in diameter and is uniform
to about 5-10%.   I think the flux we can provide is around what you are
asking for (it depends on beam size, etc.); the main limitation is that
the  ion chamber we use to do the dosimetry will begin to saturate. If
one wanted a higher flux run, we have a Faraday cup we can run behind
the sample. If you make a hole in the middle of your circuit board, then
we could use the ion chamber to tune up the uniformity, then switch to
the Faraday cup for the actual dosimetry.

The counting area for this setup is in the next cave; I think the cable
run is around 30' but I would have to confirm that. However, if you
running at high intensity, the neutron levels may be too high to sit in
that area.  We have the dosimetry set up with Timbuktu so we can run it
remotely from the Control Room in that case.

The 88" Web site home page got corrupted yesterday (my own fault), but
if you want to see a picture of this irradiation facility, you can go to
http://user88.lbl.gov/88_docs/see.html and go to the link for the Cave
3b light ion irradiation station.
