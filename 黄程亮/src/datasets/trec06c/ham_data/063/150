  I was guessing here - most chargers don't check for peak charge, since I
didn't know if the Handiboard charger did or didn't...  If the charger has a
trickle charge of more than C/50 or C/100 then NiCds will be damaged eventually
on a long-term charger, but, like I said, I was guessing about the charger
circuit on the H-board, there are some pretty smart NiCd peak-charger chips out
there.

YMMV,
