hi mike,
I have started to try to design and conduct my psychphysics experiment with 
dmdx but my problem is that I do not know how to start working with 
DMDX!!!!!
I read the whole help file but it was no use .I can not get the program to 
do anything what-so-ever for me.
I want to use DMDX to display images in desired time intervals(e.g. 50 ms) 
and then ask my subject a question about the displayed image.Anybody knowing 
how to start working with DMDX would do me more than just a favor by 
instructing me.
                           Bahador Bahrami
