    I recently finished collecting all the parts for the handyboard and
started assembly. I went all the way through the i/c board setup without
a hitch. But when I got to assembling the serial comm circuit a few
things went wrong.

    I assembled the Serial Line and Stop Switch (4.4 if you're following
the online assembly instructions on the mit site).
The first part of the testing (4.4.2) went well: The BATT LED cycles on
and then off. The PWR LED turns off when the BATT LED turns off. I
connected the main board to I/C board through the phone cable.  The HB
goes into bootstrap mode - I turned it on while holding down the STOP
switch. The PWR & BATT LEDs came on for a moment and both turned off.
Tried downloading pcode_hb.s19, using hdbl but got an error. Typed dl
pcode_hb.s19 but it timed out on serial receive. (mentioned 256 bytes
remaining). IC tells me it cannot sync with the boardPlease press the
reset button.

Here's what I do know:
The cable I'm using has the 2 and 3 pins switched (as required) and
grounds connected. It's on COM1 of my pc (so no com problems).
When I run 'dl pcode_hb.s19 -ignore_input' the program will go through
and ignore all the serial echoes and so on and load into the HB. I
believe this is true because when I then reset the HB the piezo beeper
beeps at me (I went ahead and installed that as well) as it said it
would.

So basically, sending to the HB works, but getting anything transmitted
from the HB does not happen. I believe this is true because the lights
on both boards will blink as the program is loading into the HB, but
they do nothing when the downloaders ask the HB to send something back.

Has anyone run into this problem? Could it be a faulty MAX232 on the i/c
board not letting communications through?
Thanks for your help
