Eric,

The pcode does load, or otherwise the beeper would not beep with the board
reset.  But you cannot communicate with your PC, which seems to be a very
common problem with the newer and faster PC's.

If you are using the freeware version of IC, try this after loading your
pcode:

Start your machine in DOS safe mode by holding down the F5 key as it is
starting up.   You should get a DOS command prompt.  CD to the directory
containing your freeware IC application.  Reset your board to make sure
that the pcode is running, then start up IC by typing 'IC.'  It should load
in your libraries at that point.  To make sure it is working, type in 2+2;
and you should get a return of 4.

Let me know if this works.
