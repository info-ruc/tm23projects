You have a short circuit somewhere.  The first thing to check is to make sure you
have the capacitors in the right way.  Some of them are polarized, and if you put
them in backwards, they sometimes short out, and sometimes they blow up.

The next thing to do is feel all the components on the expansion board and find
anything that is hot.  Since you have a short (probably) something will be heating
up.  Whatever it is may be very hot, so use caution.

If neither of these things work, take out all the IC's and the LCD, and start
reinstalling things until you find the thing that prevents you from loading the
pcode.  That's the bad part.

Needless to say, be careful while doing these things, because something is pulling
enough amps to pull the voltage down enough that the HC11 won't come on line.  You
don't want to smoke anything on the board.

Good luck, and be sure to wear some kind of eye shield for when a cap pops!
