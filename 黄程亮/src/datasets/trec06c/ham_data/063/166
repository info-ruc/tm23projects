OK, this is good to know.

Yes, *if* more drop is necessary, more rectifier diodes would be called
for (i.e. relatively fixed voltage drop), not a series resistor (v=iR).

I didn't have any 5watt resistors handy, so I put a pretty generic DC motor
on there as a load.  It dropped it to 6.3 volts (the classic 0.7/diode),
which is still a bit higher than I expected (aren't standard servos nominal
5V? -- I was told that >6v would blow them...), but probably not enough to
blow the servo (?).

Thanks,
