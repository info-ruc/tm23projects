hi,

Does anyone have a good idea about sound generating source.  We are
thinking of using Piezo transducers but don't know where to get them. This
is for our product design course where we are designing a singnal
indicator for an antenna.  We would like to design this antenna so that
when it's getting a strong signal it will beep.  The frequency of the beep
will be the indicator of the signal strength.  Any input will be
appreciatd.
 Thanks.


Lee
