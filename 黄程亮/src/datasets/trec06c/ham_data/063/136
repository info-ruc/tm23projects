Greetings all,

I've just finished building Kam Leang's sonar circuit as published on =
his web site, and it all seems to be working well. I am having a problem =
interfacing it to the handyboard however.
I'm not entirely sure how to set bits high and low etc on the SPI port, =
which is where I intend to hook this up. I have looked at the other =
sonar code thats around, but it hasn't been of much help.

This particular circuit doesn't use any kind of inhibitor to remove =
extreme close range signals. All I need is a ping out, then to count =
time before it bounces back. All the examples I've seen have used a =
rising edge signal, however this circuit is normally high and drops low =
when an echo is detected. The pink book just confused me even more (I =
hate to say).

Could anyone out there give me a few pointers of what bits need =
setting/resetting, and how to go about it? It would be greatly =
appreciated.

thanks
Adam
