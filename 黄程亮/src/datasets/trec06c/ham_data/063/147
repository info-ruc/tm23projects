no i disagree with this answer.  the HB is designed to be left on
normal charge indefinitely.  the batts can get a little warm.  if they
are hot then something is wrong, but a little warm is nothing to worry
about.

when fully charged and with no load it is not unusual to measure 10 to
11v on a nominal 9.6v pack.

re: adding a drop resistor in series with the servo pwr, it should not
be necessary, that is the purpose of the large 3 ampere drop diodes.

kevin, if you would, please add a load (10 ohm 5 watt resistor e.g.)
and let us know the measured voltage.

thanks,
fred
