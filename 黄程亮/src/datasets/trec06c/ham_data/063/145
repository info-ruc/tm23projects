  Ouch.  You don't want to do that too much or you will torch (may have
torched) your NiCds.  NiCds do NOT like to be overcharged, it causes a problem
called Voltage depression that many mistakenly call "memory effect".

Servos will pull up to 300ma at high loads, so a drop resistor may not be what
you want to do.  I have used hacked servos at up to 12V for 5+ minutes at a
time with them only getting a bit warm.  Are you measuring your voltage at the
ports with the charger plugged in?  This will raise that voltage a bit if you
are.  How many cells are in the battery pack?  Regardless, hobby servos will
happily chug along on as much as 7.2V for as long as you need them to.  If you
are concerned, or are using expensive servos, just put a couple more diodes in
the circuit, but make sure they can handle 300+ma loads, and remember that that
voltage will most likely drop under load.

have fun,
