   Currently I'm betting that the trouble people are having with the new 
DigitalVox device will go away if they don't have a T parameter (or any of 
it's synonym keywords), the problem occurs because the thread that is the 
digital vox doesn't get to see this new buffer size and so screws 
up.  It'll be fixed shortly (I hope).
