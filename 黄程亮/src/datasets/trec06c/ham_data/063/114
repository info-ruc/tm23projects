Hello,

I'm trying to set up a naming latency experiment using the built in
microphone of my Elonex Piranha laptop (Celeron 366). A number of errors
occur. Sometimes the speakers start playing white noise on the first trial
and the whole computer crashes. Sometimes the experiment works fine for the
first few trials and then starts triggering the digitalvox immediately for
each trial, giving an RT of 1 ms. Sometimes the system halts giving this
error message:

digitalvox looping Lock Failed
DSERR_INVALIDPARAM (80070057)
An invalid parameter was passed to the returning function

My code for each trial looks like this:

+1 <ms% 500> <bmp> "cue" / <bmp> * "target"/!;

When it gets past the first trial, the system seems to crash at a different
point each time, so I don't think it's a specific problem with one of the
lines of my code. Does anyone know what might be going wrong?

thanks,

Sam
