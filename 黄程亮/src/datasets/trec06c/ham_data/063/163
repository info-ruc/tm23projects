Hi.. I have a problem with ultrasonic sonar power supply, hope anyone can help
me.. thanks..
I run my sonar well with the exp. board using transformer, but i failed to run
it together with 2 sharp GP2D02 IR, i think may due to 2.5A surge of the sonar,
so i want to use external power for the sonar, can anyone tell me where can i
locate the power in the HB or exp. board ?? or do you have any other idea for
me ?? thanks...
