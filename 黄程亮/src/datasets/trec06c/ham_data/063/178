Im going to jump in here on this one and give an opinion.

C/10 for a NiCd is a little much for a trickle charge.  C/10 on NiCd's =
is usually considered more of a trimming type of charge following a =
higher charge rate of C or C/2 to put the bulk of the energy back in.  =
The C/10 can top the battery off and help even out the individual cell =
charge but for long periods it can be stressful.  C/50 or even C/100 is =
a better rate for a trickle charge.

But.....  And I'm saying this without having a chance to look at the =
charging circuit again..... I think the circuit actually creates a C/10 =
max rate with a voltage clamp of whatever the powersupply voltage is.  =
As the battery voltage increases during the charge the voltage drop =
across the limiting resistor decreases reducing the current into the =
battery.  This is actually the ideal condition to charge the batteries =
as long as the powersupply voltage is correct.

Anyway having said all that.  i have two HB's that I leave on the =
charger all the time.  They've been there for over two years.  When I =
take them off the charger and use them they seem to last as long as they =
did when they were new.  I'm betting if I kept them in the generally =
discharged state I would have been buying new batteries by now.
