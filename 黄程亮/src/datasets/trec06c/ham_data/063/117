   Did it work with the previous version of DMDX?  This will tell me if 
it's something in the latest version of DMDX introduced with the new 
enhanced vox code or whether there's something wrong with your 
notebook.  You might try including the recordvocal device as well, this 
will cause DMDX to use a quite different approach for the VOX.  If the 
errors continue to occur with old versions of DMDX and with the recordvocal 
device it's less likely to be DMDX (unless the same error message continues 
to get thrown), if not I can cook up a passpoint version of DMDX so I can 
get an analysis of what has gone wrong assuming you can send me the text 
files, they can be quite large.

   Anyone else tested the new VOX code yet?
