hi, may i ask how much current passing through HB will cause the HB reset ?? i
have a big problem on my HB, I power one Polaorid 6500 sonar, 1 servo and 2
hacked servos by seperated 6V 1300mAh NiMH battery with common ground, and
power 2 GP2D02 by HB exp. board with two 1.3A 6V lead acid batteries, but don't
know why, when i fired either gp2d02 or sonar with all other 3 servos, my HB
will auto reset..can anybody have the same experiment ?? besides, i heart
somebody said there will have confict when using gp2d02 and sonar together..is
 it ture  ?? thanks..
