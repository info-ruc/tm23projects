  Actually, if you had stored them fully discharged then they would likely be
as good as they day you bought them.  That is the best way to store NiCds.
However, if they are kept at a C/100 trickle charge to prevent open-circuit
discharge, they will also work fine for a very long time AND be a state of
constant readiness as well.
