We've been using DMDX here in Cambridge to run experiments in an fMRI
scanner. In these experiments it is not only crucial to set the timing of
the display of each item, but also to set the exact timing between
successive items. 


For instance, a common experiment might involve displaying a word for 1
second then a pause of 2 seconds. In this way a word would appear every 3
seconds. In setting up these experiments, we've found it very useful to
use the <<rcot> keyword to measure the time that each item occurs. This
allows us to set item timing more exactly.


However, in setting up these experiments we've noticed a strange thing.
The number of ticks that an item is expected to take does not correspond
to the time between successive items as measured by <<rcot>. For example,
the following file was run using a video mode with a refresh rate of
85Hz:


N5 <<azk> <<cr> <<nfb> <<rcot> f85 d10 <<vm 800, 600, 600, 8, 0> <<t
2000> <<id "keyboard"> <<dbc 0> <<dwc 000255000> 

+1 * "Word1" / <<% 160> /;

+2 * "Word2" / <<% 160> /;

+3 * "Word3" / <<% 160> /;

+4 * "Word4" / <<% 160> /;

+5 * "Word5" / <<% 160> /;

0 "The End. Thank you.";


We expected that the word would be displayed for 85 ticks (1 second) then
there would be a 160 tick blank frame (allowing the time-out to expire,
so that the timing would be identical regardless of subjects' responses)
then a 10 tick delay. So each item + delay should last 255 ticks (85 +
160 + 10 ticks) a total of 3 seconds. However, the .azk output looked
like this:


<bigger>  Item    RT     COT

     1  -2000       0

     2  -2000    3012

     3  -2000    6023

     4  -2000    9035

     5  -2000   12047


</bigger>showing that each item lasted 1 tick longer than 3 seconds - ie.
256 ticks.


The problem is fixed by just the delay parameter to 9 ticks. However, it
would be good to know where the extra tick comes from. Is it added to the
delay between items, or is it added to the stimulus displays? That way we
could figure out how to set up exact item timings without trial and
error.


Any ideas?
