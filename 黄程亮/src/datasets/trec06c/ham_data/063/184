then there would be a 160 tick blank frame (allowing the time-out to 
expire, so that the timing would be identical regardless of subjects' 
responses) then a 10 tick delay. So each item + delay should last 255 ticks 
(85 + 160 + 10 ticks) a total of 3 seconds. However, the .azk output looked 
like this:

   No mystery at all, you've got another frame in there, between the last 
slash and semicolon.  It's a blank frame that erases whatever was on the 
screen (granted it's already blank but DMDX doesn't know that), because 
it's the last frame in the item and there aren't other frames to be 
displayed it's displayed (which takes a tick) and DMDX then moves on to the 
next item (there is no other frame after it to make it be displayed for the 
default frame duration of 85 ticks), so in fact you've got 85 + 160 + 1 + 
10 ticks.
