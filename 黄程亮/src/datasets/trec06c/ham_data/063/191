Making the connection to the transducer by hand will very likely damage the electronics on the sonar module board. It says in the Polaroid instructions never to operate the sonar with the transducer disconnected. You should leave everything connected, then induce a ping in software only.

Just make sure you've observed the proper polarity on everything (flat flex cable, capacitor, power diodes, transducer, etc.).

You can get a small experimenter's PC board from Radio Shack and arrange the power diodes, the flat flex connector & resistor on it. This connects to the ranging module with the flat flex. Solder a female header strip to it, too, to simplify connecting the INIT, BINH, ECHO & power from the HB.

To connect this small diode/resistor board to the HB, use a ribbon wire with male headers on each end, cut to the appropriate sizes. Double up on the power conductors if your ribbon wire conductors are too small. Try to make this custom patch cable no longer than necessary to keep the signal noise & loss to a minimum. Best of luck!
