I tried with rawjoystick: it worked without the two numbers but not with 
and not with the buttons I hope. After several trials I finally found that 
<id Wingman ... (Black) ,10,1> seemed to work.
Why couldn't it polled every ms if timedx indicates "Device is Polled 
(0.120 ms) timebase 1 ms?

I've got a script that displays several pictures during short time.
On some computers they have systematically display errors the first time I 
run them and they work correctly only second run even if I did'nt run the 
script entirely the first time. Is it normal?
