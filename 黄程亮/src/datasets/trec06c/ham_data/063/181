Thanks for your help :-D

Just so I'm clear, ref pink book page 10-17.
Does the "bit_set( 0x1021, 1 );" refer to bit 0 -EDG3B, and
bit_clear( 0x1021, 2 ); " refer to bit 1 -EDG3A.
This is what was throwing me, I always thought bits started at zero and
ended at 7, not 1 to 8 as appears to be the case here. Is this what the
"zero-indexed " means?

sorry if it's a basic question, but if you don't ask you never learn :-)

thanks Again

Adam

(set, clear) instead of (clear, set), like this:
