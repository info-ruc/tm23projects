I've tried a pack I picked up at Radio Shack and they worked easy enough.
However, the ones I tried were only responding with the range 10-110 or so when
testing the port with analog(x) in different light from dark to bright.
However, an infrared phototransistor responded from 10 to 240, so I was hoping
I could buy a bunch of them in bulk. I sent a message to check and make sure
that that specific DigiKey part was equivalent to the one I got from Radio
Shack.
