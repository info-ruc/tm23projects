I just bought a Vector 2X electronic compass for a project.  In looking
at it the manual, I see that if the 2X is run in slave mode I can clock
out data from it at my leisure using any digital pins available on the
Handy Board.  This could almost be done in IC, except that the timing
for retrieving the last bit from the last SCLK signal is only 20
microseconds, so that makes the driver for clocking the data an assembly
routine.

On the web site under the contributed software section, there is a
routine that gathers the data by running the Handy Board in SPI slave
mode and the 2X in master mode, and capturing the data via SPI
transfer.  The assembly routine is imbedded in the 1000 hz system
interrupt.  I want to do it as outlined above, using a .icb function
that I can call when I need the data.  Has anyone done this yet?

Thanks in advance.
