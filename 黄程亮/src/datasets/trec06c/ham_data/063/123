I'm also at the point of trying to download to my partially assembled board
for the first time. I'm able to put the board in to download mode (both led's
come on for a short period of time then go off). When I start downloading the
green led on the interface blinks, but the led on the main board doesn't. I've
watched the voltage coming out of the 232 chip and seen it vary while the
download is happening, I've also watched the voltage on the Rx pin of the 6811
do the same thing. The Tx pin of the 6811 is always low during the download.
So I'm suspecting I' haven't managed to get the 6811 (an A1 I got from BG
Micro) in to download mode. I checked that at power on the two pins to put the
6811 in bootstrap mode are both low as the manual suggests. Now I'm stuck
and looking for suggestions on what else I can do to debug the problem.

I've been using dl on my 166Mhz Win95 box from a dos prompt. I gather from
the archives that dl automatically takes care of the config registers?

Any advice, suggestions, etc. would be appreciated. Thanks in advnace

Darin
