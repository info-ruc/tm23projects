Actually I am working with Linux, but I gave it a try and it worked just
fine.
I tested with MS Windows NT Workstation 4.0 Service Pack 5. Just open a
command
prompt and use this ic-version.

There is no admin-account needed. Perhaps you will have to check
permissions on
the serialport. An easy way is to connect a modem and check if the
required user
account is able to dial out. In this case, just connect the Handyboard
to the same
port and start ic (or dl which proved to work properly as well). If the
user cannot
dial out, you will probably have to check your RAS-Setup.

Hope this helps.
