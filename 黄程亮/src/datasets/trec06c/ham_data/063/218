Just wondering... in reference to the modification on the Polaroid 6500
sonar ranging board, there's been two different assertions. Should the 0.1uF
cap be of a polarized (e.g.  electrolytic, tant, etc.) or non-polarized
variety (as stated below)?... or does it matter?

Thanks,
John

The location(C7) for the .1uF that you are refering to is located on the
sonar driver board, on the lower left corner of the ribbon connector. Any
non-polarized cap will do just fine.
