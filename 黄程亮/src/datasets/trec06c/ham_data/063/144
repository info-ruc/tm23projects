In the sonar code from the web site, the rising edge detection on timer input channel 3 (TIC3) is set like this:

   bit_clear( 0x1021, 2 ); bit_set( 0x1021, 1 );

According to the little pink book, address 0x1021 is the Timer Control Register 2 (TCTL2) (in the Register & Control Bit Assignments section). To set channel 3 to capture falling edges only, you'd make the last two bits (set, clear) instead of (clear, set), like this:

   bit_set( 0x1021, 2 ); bit_clear( 0x1021, 1 );

Hope this helps!

BTW, can anyone tell me why the bit_set and bit_clear commands aren't zero-indexed WRT the bit index (like everything else in C and machine code is)? Just curious.

All the examples I've seen have used a rising edge signal, however this circuit is normally high and drops low when an echo is detected. The pink book just confused me even more (I hate to say).
