Attached is the official announcement of the second Graduate Opportunities
Fellowship competition.  Once we have confirmed the details we will announce
who has been selected by the Minorities Advisory Committee in the first
announcement.

If you know of additional/prospective graduate students that we should
nominate, please let us know as soon as possible.  Please notify me if you
have any questions.  Thank you!
