   Ok, so I've found the trouble with the DigitalVox device in 1.2.00 and 
have fixed it in 1.2.02.  The trouble arose because the DigitalVox 
remembered the size of the capture buffer, when the timeout was changed to 
a lower value things blew up, this probably also had side effects that were 
bad but that did not cause the machine to crash when the time limit was 
changed to a larger value.
