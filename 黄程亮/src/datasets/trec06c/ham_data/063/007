From http://www.acroname.com/robotics/info/examples/GP2D02-2/GP2D02-2.html :
    "This example assumes that port PA5 on the Handy Board was connected to
    the input of the GP2D02 detector and that port PA0 on the Handy Board was
    connected to the output of the GP2D02 detector."

What do PA0 and PA5 refer to?

And when using the GP2D12, it's necesary to cut the resistor pullup out of the
circuit for the port that the sensor is plugged into, correct? Thus making the
port useless for the typical light and reflectance sensors that would
otherwise be easily used in that port?

Thx again!

(I promise that I'll eventually contribute something useful to the community
to make up for all of my questions :)
