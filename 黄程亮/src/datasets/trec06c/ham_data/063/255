Hi

I use a Polaroid sonar ranging modul with the HB and the expansionboard. It all
went well, but by mistake i put the digital in from J12 to a digital out. Since
then i get the result -1 and the sonar isn't clicking. I've tried with another
sonar modul.
What else could be damaged? All other things work still fine.

Thanx

Martin
