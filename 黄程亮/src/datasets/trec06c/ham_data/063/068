I had a very similar problem with my robot. When the servos are under high
load (ie holding up your robot) and you try to move them all at once, the
current drawn is quite large. I never actually measured how large, but large
enough to destroy a 1A plugpack! I also found that the plugpack has a
"recovery time" of sorts in that after moving the servos, there is a finite
period of time before the same move can be performed.

My final solution was to either slow the movements (ie don't move them all
at once, just 3 or so at a time) of the servos or to use a battery designed
for model aircraft which can supply high current for short periods of time.
Of course you should also try and reduce the weight wherever possible. Also
try to use a lever arrangement to "gear" the legs to provide more torque at
the cost of slightly reduced height of the step.

Check out www.wantree.com.au/~oli and have a look at the pictures to see
what I mean about gearing the leg

Hope this helps
Adam
