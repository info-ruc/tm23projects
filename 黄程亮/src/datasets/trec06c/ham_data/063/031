When using the GP2D02, you are using port A, pin 5 and port A, pin 0.  That's
where the PA0 and PA5 terminology comes from.  I wrote that particular piece on
the Acroname website, so I apologize for not being more clear.

And yes, it is necessary to cut a trace to remove the pullup resistor when using
the GP2D12 on one of the analog ports.  You can fix it later very easily if need
be.
