Hi Jonathan,

Hopefully just before sending the version out: can you add two keyword
indexes, one sorted by keyword and one sorted by description? I see how
the new thing (sort by description) comes in handy more often than the old
index (by keyword) but the old one is still VERY practical if you are
looking for the meaning of <X>.  (where X != Life, for which see
completely different helpfiles :-)

Cheers, 
Dirk
