    Hi
    Finaaly got my exp board working and now yet another problem. When checking
    sensors, every 4 secs or so I always get 255.(when printing sensor value to
screen would be like : 2,2,2,2,2,2,2,255,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,255,etc., i knew its not
the sensor because the sensor works fine on the old analog  headers on the HB.
Is this a  problem with my board or is this they way its supposed to be?


    Thanx in advance-Alex
