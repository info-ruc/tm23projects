Hi,

A while ago I shorted out my handy board which caused the ram chip to fry.
I've since replaced it, and the board boots again, but I am now seeing
other strange behaviour.

The batteries are connected and the board recieves power, but when I turn it
off the contents of RAM is lost unless the rj11 jack is plugged into the
charger/serial board.  The charger board need not be plugged into the wall, so
the power is coming from the batteries, and I've checked with a voltage meter
that there is always +5v to the RAM chip.  If I turn off the board and unplug
the rj11 jack, the board no longer boots and the pcode needs to be reloaded.
If I really quickly turn it off, remove the rj11 jack and turn it on again, it
works but then if I leave it off for more than a few moments the RAM is lost.

If I call sleep() or msleep() or anything that uses them from IC the heart
beat stops and I have to reset the board.

The infrared input/ouput seems to work fine, and I have an expansion board
with a polaroid sonar, and it works fine too.  Normal IC stuff, printf etc.
works fine.

What I believe happened with the catastrophic failure of my ram chip is that
the pins on the bottom of the board pierced the insulation on the wires to the
battery.  I disconnected it quickly but there was smoke and sparks.  The board
worked perfectly before this, and booted right up on replacing the RAM chip.

Any help is appreciated...Thank you

Jake
