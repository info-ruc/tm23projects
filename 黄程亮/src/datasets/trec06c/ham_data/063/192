No, that's a very good question. It had me confused, too. The second argument to bit_set and bit_clear is not actually the index of a bit at all; it's a bit mask.

For example, when you do bit_set( 0x1021, 3 ), the 3 becomes 0000 0011 in binary, so it will set the last two bits of the address. Hope this helps!
