Lourdes,

Yes, I use NT and my handyboard all the time.  There should be no problem
communicating with the handyboard, but there is one important consideration.  NT is
"jealous" of its ports, so if you want to run the DOS downloader (that is what I
use), then no windows program can be "holding" the communications port.  Similarly,
to use windows communications with the handyboard, no DOS program can be using that
port.  NT does not share the port between DOS and windows at all.

Consequently, make sure that no other programs are using the communications port,
and only use the DOS downloader.  I know that others have reported success with the
windows downloader, but it has never worked on NT for me.

CHeers,

-Richard
