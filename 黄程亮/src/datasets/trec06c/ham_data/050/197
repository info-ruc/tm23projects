STOP SHOUTING, WE CAN HEAR YOU ;^).

I had good success using the routines available here: http://www.cam.org/~mdavies/HB/ir.htm. These works just fine, you use the test program to get the values and voila, any remote control I tried just worked. 

The only problem I have is the receiver: it's not omnidirectional, and the angle of reception is not that big. You have to be on the right side of your robot to control it, and as soon as it turn you lose contact.

In my experience remote control is useful for switching algorithms, but not to teleoperate the robot. Let the robot be autonomous but listen to the remote for absolute orders (like "STOP NOW", "U-TURN", "Sing" or "Follow the wall", "Find the light"...).

If you really want remote operation you should investigate radio communication. The line of sight for a remote is not good enough.
