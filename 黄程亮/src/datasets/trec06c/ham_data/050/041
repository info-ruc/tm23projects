Hi,

After some testing and try-ing I found the following solution for a =
cheap shaft encoder for LEGO use:

I glued a cheap Infrared Reflectance Sensor to the middle of the bottom =
of a 2x3 tile (so the sensor faces downwards) and put two 1x2 tiles on =
either side next to it. Then I used TipEx (white typewriter flued) to =
accentuate the 4 sides of a LEGO axle. Positioned the sensor above the =
axle by clicking it on top of the bar through which the axle went and =
presto.

Using the standard IC drivers everything worked without having to adjust =
the thresholds... Since the resolution is far from perfect I have put a =
gear (1:3) between the driving axle and the sensor axle to get 12 ticks =
per wheel revolution.

Happy HandyBoarding Lego-ers!=20
