THANK YOU!  When I respond to email from interested students, I always
respond to their personal email, not a generic one.  However, this a.m., I
have received over 25 email messages from frustrated individuals asking to
be removed from the list - problem is that WE DIDN'T SEND the email to begin
with and I was beginning to think that someone here at our own university
was responsible (we have had some problems lately with a couple of hackers).
Thanks for your message.  Hopefully, this will terminate soon.
