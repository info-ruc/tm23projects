I have tried to avoid contributing to this problem but it now
looks like it will go on forever if I don't inject one more
message.

The solution is NEVER SEND ANYTHING TO CSLIST@FUDAN.EDU

If you are interested in the "why" continue to read the message
I sent earlier.

I plan to send Mr. Gao a message that he and any other students
who use this time-wasting spam attack that he can forget about
receiving materials from Clemson.

>I have gotten two of these today. One from SUNY Buffalo and one
>from UCSC.  (I also got an "original" from China)
>
>As near as I can tell here is what is happening:
>Fudan has a mail distributer that Mr. Gao sends a message to
>and the distributer sends the message to EVERY CS grad program
>in the good ole USofA (maybe multiple messages!)
>
>Now if Ms. X       at SUNY or Ms. Y     at UCSC  or Dr. Westall
>at Clemson inadvertently
>sends their canned responses to cslist@fudan.edu rather than
>gyqin@fundan.edu... then their reply is reflected back to everybody
>on the original list and to make matters worse, Mr. Gao never
>sees it and so he may try again!

>
>I don't think we will EVER stop this Chinese spam and so it would
>appear that any of us who respond should be REALLY careful not to
>respond to what looks like a list!
