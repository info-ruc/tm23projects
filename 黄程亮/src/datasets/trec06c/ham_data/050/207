You could certainly heat plasma that way, but I can't see how you could store 
heat that way?

No. 3              URANOS CLUB NEWSLETTER          27.VIII.1999

This is the new issue of our irregularly published 
electronic newsletter.

To receive further issues of this newsletter, please send 
please send a letter stating so to the address:
                   <uranos@uranos.eu.org>
---------------------------------------------------------------
Changes to the URANOS site:
---------------------------
- The Club website is now accessible at two addresses -
  the old one ( http://www.uranos.eu.org/ ), and a new one,
  with Polish domain ( http://www.uranos.org.pl/ ). 
  It makes us more visible to Polish web indexes.
  The old address now automatically directs the incoming
  access requests to the English version of the site, 
  while the new one accesses the Polish version first.
  Of course, once at the site, you may switch freely between 
  both versions of all bilingual pages.
- We have extended the site significantly with new sections
  "Poland and Poles in space exploration" and "Mars exploration".
- The new Polish section contains:
  -- information about Polish space research institutions
     (research institutes, university faculties, astronomical
     observatories, planetariums) - addresses (postal and
     electronic), phone numbers, links to WWW sites;
  -- information about Polish organizations related to 
     space exploration - addresses (postal and electronic), 
     phone numbers, links to WWW sites, publications;
  -- a list of space objects with names of Polish origin;
  -- information about Polish scientists who made significant 
     contributions to space exploration - short biographical
     notes like that found on the main explorers page;
  -- information about Polish cosmonauts and astronauts.
- The section on Mars exploration initiates a new large 
  section "The Settler's Guide to the Solar System", 
  and includes:
  -- general astronomical and physical data on Mars,
     with a short commentary;
  -- an extensive list of links to the most interesting 
     websites on Mars and its exploration;
  -- a description of Robert Zubrin's "Mars Direct" proposal
     for manned missions to Mars;
  -- information about The Mars Society, including its
     Founding Declaration (both in English and Polish)
     and information about its recently formed Polish chapter 
     (named "Mars Society Polska") with which our Club started  
     a close collaboration.
- We have added many new links - in the list of Polish space 
  websites, and in the general list of recommended websites  
  (including a whole new category "Transport to orbit" and 
  significant enlargement of the "Commercial activity in space"  
  category). We also have done a general checking of the links,   
  deleting the dead ones and updating many others.
- We have added two new entries to our list of recommended 
  Polish-language books ("Comets" by Yeomans and advance
  notice of the "NASA Solar System Atlas").
- Portraits of great contributors to space exploration 
  have been added to our biographical pages. 
- We have introduced numerous improvements of navigation aids, 
  graphics, etc., and corrected various errors.

Other information:
------------------
- Our appeal for help in verifying the English language  
  versions of our pages drew the response of several people.
  Currently two persons are helping us to do this - thank you!
- Now we are looking for people willing to translate our
  remaining Polish texts into English - our only translator
  noticeably lags behind schedule...
- On the list of our site contributors we distinguish 
  the positions of Site Editors - those members of our group 
  who personally have developed and maintained some sections 
  or parts of our pages.
- The <klub@uranos.eu.org> discussion list now counts 
  36 subscribers.

Special information - The URANOS Club is now one year old!
----------------------------------------------------------
- On August 18, 1999 exactly one year has passed since  
  the official appearance of our site on the Web. In that time
  our site has been rebuilt and extended several times, 
  gathering many new supporters and sympathizers of our Club,
  on our two e-mail lists <devel> and <klub>, and  
  on the distribution list for the Club Bulletin.  
  An excerpt from the usage statistics for the first year
  of activity shows among others:
  -- the total number of hits: over 65,000;
  -- average numbers of hits:
     . per month: around 5,000 (peak values: 7,417 in April, 
       7,414 in May, and 7,098 in July of 1999),
     . per day: around 170 (peak values: 811 on Aug. 28, 1998,
       831 on Dec. 9, 1998, and 704 on Apr. 10, 1999 r.).
  -- the principal domains of the visitors: over 60% from 
     Poland; over ten percent "unknown" and the US (mostly 
     .com, and some .edu), then .net, followed by the rest 
     of the world (one percent or less for the domain), 
     from all continents, including New Zealand, Taiwan,
     Brasil, etc.

definitely good site, odd that they have added this new address rather

I wonder if this could be used effectively as an interstellar break?  Nothing 
in the paper talks about effective ISP or power consumption vrs thrust.

http://peaches.niac.usra.edu/studies/9801/winglee.html


The Mini-Magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion, M2P2 , system provides a 
revolutionary means for spacecraft propulsion that can efficiently utilize 
the energy from the space plasmas to accelerate payloads to much higher 
speeds than can be attained by present chemical (oxidizing propulsion 
systems.  The system utilizes an innovative configuration of existing 
technology based on well established principles of plasma physics. It has the 
potential of feasibly providing cheap, fast propulsion that could power 
Interstellar Probe, as well as powering payloads that would be required for a 
manned mission to Mars. As such the proposed work for missions out of the 
solar system and between the planets. The project is interdisciplinary 
involving space science, plasma engineering, and aeronautics and space 
transportation, which are key components of NIAC's program. The M2P2 system 
utilizes low energy plasma to transport or inflate a magnetic field beyond 
the typical scale lengths that can be supported by a standard solenoid 
magnetic field coil. In space, the inflated magnetic field can be used to 
reflect high speed (400 - 1000 km/s) solar wind particles and attain 
unprecedented acceleration for a power input of only a few kW which can be 
easily achieved by solar electric units. Our initial estimates for a minimum 
system can provide a typical thrust of about 3 Newton continuous (0.6 MW 
continuous power), with a specific impulse of 104 to 105s) to produce an 
increase in speed of about 30 km/s in a period of 3 months. Proposed 
optimization could allow the development of system that increase the 
acceleration with less expenditure of fuel so that a mission could leave the 
solar system could become a reality.

I've seen a couple comments and proposals by NASA showing they are
seriously looking into fusion system.  They realize chemical propulsion
is to limited, and nuclear is to politically unpopular.

The high density antimatter store proposal is interesting too.  No
detail in the paper, but hopefully they have useful concepts.

The EST concept was wild.  Storing power in magnetic fields?  If it works, 
this could be big.

Sounds like we found the IMPULSE drive of star trek type space craft.
If the plasma propulsion idea can be expanded into a real interstellar ramjet,
next stop the planets.

the M2P2 can be served as a propulsion to move a payload out of out solar system or to the planets in the solar system, but how about getting a payload into a solar system?

Leo,
	Maybe point yrself in the direction of the star, accelerate until
the heliopause, coast, and decelerate in the target system?

Hi SD

The system seems to have a lot of potential within this system but as an
interstellar drive it's pretty pitiful except for missions to the solar
focus at 550 AU or so. It's maximum velocity is limited to the speed of the
solar wind which is only 500-1000 km/s, so it'd be a long time between stars
unless you had a secondary drive or a working ramscoop. A better system
would be a magneto-sail pushed up to interstellar speeds by a massive
particle beam. Powered by fusion it'd push the costs of probe launches way
down since it'd only take a few hours at a time to accelerate probes up to ~
0.3c or so. I think all this has been discussed before and the basic design
settled on involves a lithium-fusor launched via a beam/laser to 0.3c [?],
boosted to 0.4c by fusors and deccelerated by a mag-sail.

Still the mini-magnetosphere will make possible some cheap and fast
non-nuclear OutPlanet missions, so more power to them!!!

Adam

Tacking works in water sailing because a boat is resistant to
moving sideways through the water.  When you tack the wind on the
sail produces a sideways thrust component that is strongly
resisted by the boat's orientation in the water and a forward
component that isn't, so the boat makes net forward motion
(especially if you zig-zag).  Unfortunately that isn't a property
of spaceships, so they can't tack.  There's a certain amount you
can do if the spaceship is already in orbit around the star; you
can arbitrarily raise or lower the spaceship's orbit using a sail
to produce thrust components with or against the ship's orbital
motion.  But you can't accelerate a ship towards the star with
the sail any better than just furling the sail and letting the
star's gravity pull you in.

The whole topic of the disscussion started because of tapping into the solar
wind.
1)  Solar wind
2)  Magnetic sail 

    ]---------------------------------------------------
    ]------------------------#-------------------------- wind
sun ]-----------------------#---------------------------
    ]----------------------#--sail#1--------------------
    ]----------------------#########---sail#2-----------

So you add a second sail to provide your sideways resistance.
Problem solved I think.
what about the ship designs that use a wind driven upright turbine
that turns the propeller of the ship? can that be adapted here?

Actually the "impulse drives" were a modified fusion drive (must have played 
games with inertia to get the spec impulse they'd need), and ramjets probably 
don't do you a lot of good in this sector of the galaxy.

I think Robert Forward has adequately covered the subject of tacking solar
sails, it is possible, it does work like a boat, and it isn't necessarily
dependent upon having water and a keel, even to go "upwind".

Doesn't work.  Only works in system because your 'tacking' is really altering 
your orbit traj around the sun.

My thought was that the interstelar dust and debries might make a damn good 
ion flow and act like a solar wind while at speed .4c.  If you could cut down 
a good fraction of that speed before you have to hit the decel boost, you 
could save a ton of fuel.  I hadn't thought of using it as a sail for 
boosting out.  Interesting idea though.

from welcome message of majordomo@lists.uoregon.edu

Although clearly there is much speculation involved in the
development of future technology, this mailing list is
practically oriented and proposals should be justifiable using
presently-known engineering techniques and scientific knowledge.
Proposals involving highly speculative topics such as FTL
(faster-than-light) propulsion or novel energy generation
techniques will be treated quite skeptically by list members.
-------------------------------


Thank you for welcoming me to your mailing list.

I have a patent pending on a rocket engine that may be of interest to some of 
your members.

There are seven claims with the seventh being a machine to test Einstein's 
theory that a machine other than a particle accelerator may be found to 
exceed light speed.

I have no desire to discuss the validity of the seventh claim to keep any 
responses to issues of my machine principles of applied physics and not the 
theoretical projections of it's operating limits. I welcome other feedback 
(claims one to six or patents in general) even when healthily skeptical. I

The latest info I have from 'The Hill' is Letters and Faxes are
being counted on this issue.

              Space Access Political Action Alert 9/3/99
____________________________________________________________________

  - Contact Your Congressman by Wednesday!
  - Senate HUD/VA Markup Likely Week After Next

           Write, Fax or Call Your Congressman by Wednesday!

Congress will come back into session after their August break this
coming Wednesday, September 8th.  The full House is currently
expected to debate and vote on their HUD/VA (NASA) Appropriation
that same day.  As it emerged from committee, that bill contains
roughly $900 million in NASA cuts, about two-thirds of that in
space-based science.  We are asking you all to contact your local
Congressman and ask him or her to restore the NASA space science
budget cuts in the HUD/VA Appropriation.

This may seem a bit outside our area, but we do have what we think
are good reasons.  First, unless these cuts are in large part
restored, there is very little chance we'll get an "add" for NASA
Future-X.  Restoring some significant part of the cuts in the House
improves odds of getting Future-X money added in the Senate, in our
estimation.   Second, these parts of NASA being cut are those that
tend to be most flexible about buying commercial launches when
appropriate; they are good for the market that we're trying to
encourage.  Third, these parts of NASA being cut tend to be places
where better-faster-cheaper has actually been happening; this is a
trend we'd like to encourage.

Note that we are taking no position on the Shuttle and Station cuts
that make up the other third of the overall reductions.  The message
we recommend is "restore the NASA space science cuts".  "Restore the
NASA cuts" period is of course an option if you prefer.

How To Do It

Get your Congressman's DC office address or phone or fax number, via
www.vote-smart.org (have an old bill with your nine-digit zip handy)
or by calling your local library's information desk.

If you're writing or faxing, compose a polite concise one-page
letter to them, identifying yourself as a constituent of theirs,
telling them what you'd like them to do, then briefly explaining
why - just hit one or two high points, don't overexplain.  Thank
them for their attention, sign the letter, and send it.

If you're writing, remember Monday is a holiday - get it to the Post
Office Saturday or you'll have to overnight it Tuesday.

If phoning during Tuesday or first thing Wednesday, dial their DC
office number, ask for whoever handles NASA appropriations
questions, then when connected to that staffer (or more likely their
voice mail) tell them briefly who you are ("I'm Joe Smith from
Peoria") and what you want them to do ("Restore the NASA space
science budget cuts"), then (unless they have questions) thank them
for their time and ring off [202-225-3121 Cap. SB].


              Senate HUD/VA Markup Likely Week After Next

The next key item is going to be persuading the Senate Appropriators
to "add $30 million for NASA Future-X flight demonstrators, as
provided for in the House NASA Authorization".  The Senate HUD/VA
Appropriations Subcommittee is currently expected to "mark up"
sometime during the week of September 13th.  There is a small chance
they might get to that late next week; we'll be putting out a
specific Alert on that either way.  Meanwhile, for you self-starters
out there, the subcommittee members are Stevens AK, Byrd WV, Bond
MO, Burns MT, Shelby AL, Craig ID, Hutchison TX, Kyl AZ, Mikulski
MD, Leahy VT, Lautenberg NJ, Harkin IA - call fax or write with the
above message, if one of these is your Senator.

Thanks!

Space Science Policy Alert #4.
Monday 6 September 1999.  By Tim Kyger

*Cross-posting of the data in this message is strongly encouraged. *

_* Night Comes In *_
On Wednesday, 8 September 1999, Congress returns from summer recess.  On
Wednesday, 8 September, the House will consider, debate, and vote on
H.R. 2684, the FY '00 VA/HUD Appropriations Bill, which funds NASA.

H.R. 2684 contains a cut to NASA of about a billion dollars -- unless
changed.

The Senate's VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee will meet on Thursday, 9
September to mark their FY '00 VA/HUD bill.  Current word is that they,
too, will cut NASA's requested FY '00 budget by about a billion dollars or
so.

We have three days to change things.

_* Bonds Speaks Redux *_ Senator Kit Bond (R-MO) is the Chair of the
Senate's VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee.  He says that (at least as of
August 3rd)  that he has not received any appeals to keep NASA's budget at
pre-cut levels, and further, that he does not have any meetings planned on
the issue.  Senator Bond's spokesman Dan Hubbard said, "I am certain that
no one has been in contact with us on this issue."  It was further said
that Senator Bond has no plans to meet with NASA Administrator Dan Goldin,
or with pro-NASA Senator Mike DeWine (R-OH), or anyone else about this
issue.

Folks should let Senator Bond know what they want -

_* I Know What You Did Last Summer. *_
I worked on Capital Hill for eight years. Letters have more political
clout than phone calls.  Email has the least political clout of anything
you can do, ranking lower than even a phone call.  You can always fax your
letter, however, and this is probably the most convenient way to register
your opinion on this matter.  (Staffers assume that paper mail or faxes
take more effort, so they take them more seriously.)

Last week, Capitol Hill had started to receive letters, calls, faxes,
and email.  But it was only a trickle.  If we are to prevail, it has to
change from light rain to a hurricane.

A draft letter that may be used to model your letters will be found at
the end of this message.

After you write and/or fax Senator Bond, write and/or fax Senator
Mikulski, the Ranking Democrat on the Senate VA/HUD Appropriations
Subcommittee:

Barbara Mikulski (D-MD)
202/224-4654 vox
202/224-8858 fax

When you're done, write and/or fax the following other two Senators:

Ted Stevens (R-AK), Chairman of the full Appropriations Committee

202/224-2354 fax

Robert Byrd (D-WV) is the full Committee Ranking Democrat, and he is
also on the VA/HUD Subcommittee.

202/228-0002 fax
304/342-5855 in Charleston

_* Why We Fight *_
If you want to see the damage these proposed cuts to NASA's budget would
do, point your browser at:

http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/oss/announce/housefull2000.html

_* History in the Making *_
The following point was first made to me by Chaz Miller, formerly of
ProSpace.  Good point, Chaz!

The debate that will occur on H.R. 2684 this coming Wednesday will
constitute the first policy debate by our elected representatives on
what the goals of the U.S. ought to be for its federal civil space program
in at least a generation -- certainly it will be the first in *my* adult
lifetime (born in '55.you do the math!).  Debates on the Space Station
don't count; they've only been debates about a specific program within
NASA.

You owe it to yourself to be aware of what is said in this coming
debate.

You also owe it to yourself, and to our posterity, to try to influence
this debate beforehand.

-* Silence Means Security; Silence Means Approval. *_
Write those letters!

If you need more background information, please see the website at the
following URL:

http://home.marssociety.org/usa-political/news/kyger-3b-19990830.html

or http://www.reston.com/nasa/budget.html

Stay tuned.  This is going to be a long fight.

Hi SD,

Well here's the URL for the Final Report on the Stable Plasma power storage
concept...

http://peaches.niac.usra.edu/studies/9801/9801Final/SewardFinal.pdf

...it requires Adobe Acrobat 3.0. It seems to have great potential and the
plasma could be powered up by any old energy source, via a microwave
injector or some such. Theoretically a stable plasma could be put in a jet
engine and the aircraft would require NO fuel, and still have enough power
to travel around the world! It'd just compress and heat normal air...
Applied to a space launcher the savings could be immense, and applied to a
Mars mission the mass would go from ~ 600 t [split between three launches]
to one launch of about 120 t! That's an 80% saving in mass and God knows how
much in equipment and development.

Ultimately it could go into a system using small sub-plasmas for thrust and
achieve maybe 60,000 s Isp... I can see real potential for this coupled with
a Bussard fusor for high speed Deep Space missions...

Hi Guys...

Here's another really interesting design... for very light-weight 25 metre
space-telescopes, a hundred of which would make up an interferometer cluster
and allow terrestrial planets to be imaged [10,000 pixel images] around
other stars... all for about $6 billion. Spread over ten years, and able to
do useful work from the word go, the system would make planet-mapping
routine, and could easily be in place by 2020.

http://peaches.niac.usra.edu/studies/9801/9801Final/BekeyFinal.pdf

this one really excites me because it could happen and it'd be cheap
compared with the hundreds of billions needed for a Planet Imager built the
usual way...

Hi SD,

That's a bloody good Idea Kevin. Beamed power without the need for totally
beamed power, just a kind of top up. A pure microwave system never struck me
as safe, but a plasma storage system has an advantage...

I don't think the plasma will scale to make a large space launcher possible.
My guess is still a air launched pseudo SSTO space plane with a payload in the
2-3 ton
range for low earth orbit. The problem is scaling and heat flow. I suspect a
external field of some kind will be needed to keep the plasma stable for energy
addition
and removal. ( Mr Fusion of "Back to the future" comes to mind here for a
successful reactor
size wise <grin>). The heat produced from say a 70% efficient engine still has
to fed through small area.
Assuming a 10^9 J? plasma  we are looking at about 3 feet diameter with a 1 foot
hole.
That's a lot of heat and external forces wanting to push the  field out of
shape. I wonder
how the field would explode if pushed out of shape? Lots of nasty X-rays is my
guess.
quick calculations ... 2 ton payload 3 ton unmanned craft ... Isp = 6,000. g=32
mi=5 tons
v 30,000 ft/sec
Mf = (e(V/(g*isp)-1)Mi  = 1 ton.
Ben.
I wonder if C4H would work for fuel?

Not only that, but you would want one on-board for emergencies, in case you
had a "Flame-out".  So I think that an external elctro-magnetic device
should be built in to the containment vessel.

I wonder if the air-flow could be directed in such a way as to couple with
the rotational component of the plasma, so as to help keep it stable,
instead of breaking it.

Cherenkov radiation?  It would be one hell of an EMP wouldn't it?  I'll bet
it will be spread out over the EM spectrum in a gaussian shape with some
characteristic frequency peak.

>I wonder if C4H would work for fuel?

Any gas/liquid should work as well as any other.  Assuming you mean
methane, it would combust in the reaction chamber while in flight, adding a
little kick, but the main gas for the atmospheric portion will have to be
plain old air.  Once out in space, you'd have to bring your own O2 to
combust the CH4, and that costs extra weight.

I think plain old water would be the best.  You could build the water tank
around the plasma, to provide extra sheilding if the plasma collapsed,
Then the heat leakage from the plasma will help warm the water and keep it
liquid out in space.

What would happen if you threw one these plasma rings at someone?  How
would you do that, and how could you make sure the field collapsed when it
reached it target?  That energy has to go somewhere....

It sounds like kevin has invented the phaser weapon.
Large plasma ring to feed tiny plasma rings to be shot into a target.
1) small high density ring -- stun with EM pulse.
2) low density ring        -- pain/wound
3)  med density ring       -- kill
