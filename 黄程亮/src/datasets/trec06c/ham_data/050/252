Like the rest of you, I am getting tired of receiving e-mail
with the subject address.  However, I have received only
1 message that did not originate from someone who wanted
to be taken off the list.  To be taken off an alias list, you do
not send the e-mail to all people on the list.  Send the request
to the originator of the e-mail.  I suggest if you receive any
e-mail addressed to   cslist@fudan.edu   simply reply to the
sender - DO NOT REPLY TO ALL ADDRESSEES.
Reply with nothing else than the original message.
