FROM THE DESK OF 
BARR. Joe Wires	 
NO 12 ALAKIJA NEMBE TOWN 
LAGOS NIGERIA. 
DEAR Sir/Madam


 
I am BARR. Mike Muller, a Solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney 
to MR  Ecrivez moi, a nationality of your country, who used to work with 
Shell Development Company in Nigeria. Here after, shall be referred to 
as my client. On the 21st Of April 2001, my client, his wife and their 
three children were involved in a car accident along Sapele 
express-road. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives. 

Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate any 
of my clients extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last 
name over the Internet, to locate any member of his family hence I 
contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and 
property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits was lodged. 

Particularly, the Finance Bank of Nigeria Plc, where the deceased had 
an account valued at about Sixteen Million, Five Hundred And Twenty Two 
Thousand 
United States Dollars (US$16.522m) has issued me a notice to provide 
the Next of Kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten 
official working days. 
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 2 
years now I seek your consent topresent you as the Next of Kin of the 
deceased since you have the same last name so that the proceeds ofthis 
account valued at (USD16.522M) can be paid to you and then you and me can 
share the money.

 60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal documents that 
can be used to back up any claim we may make. 

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us seeing this deal 
through. I guarantee that this willbe executed under a egitimate 
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Do send your 
reply on my Email address above and do not forget to include your 
confidential telephone/fax numbers and your full residential address.

contact me through my alternative mail box barristerj.wires@yahoo.com
Best Regards. 

          BARR.Joe Wires
