Hi Mike,
I'm glad we're on a first name basis, 'cause your
previous e-mail did tick me off just a little bit.
Actually I did get a number of messages addressed
only to me thanking me for my original message.  A
number of people said they were inadvertently
doing a REPLY TO ALL.  Others somehow thought
that responding to the cslist address would send it
to the originator.
I am filtering all my messages addressed to
cslist@fudan.edu
directly to my trash bin, but I've been unable to
filter out those for which that infamous address in
not the only address.  Both Netscape Messenger and
Pegasus "act" like they can do that, but neither of
them will.  Any ideas.
