Thank you for your interest in the Graduate School at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.  Unfortunately, due to the large volume of e-mail we receive, we are unable to respond individually to each.  A few general questions are answered below; however, there is much more information posted on the Graduate School's website at:  www.umass.edu/gradschool

If you are requesting admissions information, please complete and submit the application request form found on our website at:  www.umass.edu/gradschool/request

Your materials will be mailed to you within a couple of days of the form's submission.  For international mailings, please allow at least 3 weeks to receive this application.  PLEASE DO NOT MAKE DUPLICATE REQUESTS DURING THIS PERIOD AS THEY WILL NOT BE PROCESSED.

>From this site you can also download a copy of the entire application form in a matter of a few minutes, and we certainly advise you to choose this option, if possible. 

If you do not have access to the web, you can resubmit your e-mail but use this address:  gradapp@resgs.umass.edu .  Bear in mind that there may be processing delays using this procedure.  Be sure to include a complete address and desired program if you are requesting admission materials.

APPLICATION FEE WAIVERS

If you are an international applicant, the $40.00 application fee can NOT be waived or deferred.  We recommend that you not request admissions materials unless your are in a position to pay the fee.  An application submitted without the fee simply will NOT be processed.

You will be able to check on the status of credentials received and any decision by accessing the Graduate School's web site.  You will need a PIN which will be mailed to you  after of your application has been processed.  PIN's are not sent by e-mail or given over the telephone.

UNIVERSITY FUNDING

For all applicants most funding is granted through the department to which you apply.  Questions concerning this funding should be directed to that department.  U.S. citizens may also submit a FAFSA form to the Financial Aid Office for need-based funding.

TEST SCORES

An official copy of test results from the Educational Testing Service must be submitted, when required (refer to application form).  Photocopies are not considered official.  A TOEFL score of 550 (CBT-213) is required by the Graduate School.  For other tests (GRE & GMAT) there are no minimum scores established by the Graduate School.
