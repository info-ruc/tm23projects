Your message to academic@cs.uiuc.edu has been received. Please do not 
send duplicate messages; your mail is being processed.  This is the Department
of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  If
you wish to reach another department or campus you must contact them directly.
We can not forward your message to other departments or campuses.  

Please read below concerning response to any inquiries.

SPECIAL NOTES:

THE DEADLINE FOR SUMMER OR FALL 99 PASSED AS OF 1/15/99.  THIS IS A FIRM
DEADLINE, NO APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED PAST THE DEADLINE.

LETTERS CONCERNING ADMISSIONS DECISIONS ARE BEING MAILED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE
BY OUR STAFF UPON NOTIFICATION FROM THE ADMISSIONS COMMITTEE.  THE DEPT'S 
POLICY DOES NOT ALLOW NOTIFICATION VIA EMAIL OR TELEPHONE INQUIRIES.        

"GRAD CONNECT", THE NEW ONLINE WEB BASED GRADUATE APPLICATION WILL BE 
AVAILABLE BY LATE OCTOBER 1999.  APPLICANTS MAY STILL USE THE PAPER
APPLICATIONS, BUT WE ARE ENCOURAGING THOSE APPLICANTS FOR FALL 2000
OR LATER TO USE THE WEB APPLICATION.  THE CS WEB SITE WILL CONTINUE
TO LINK TO THE GRADUATE COLLEGE WEB SITE TO DOWNLOAD APPLICATION
MATERIALS.  THE CS WEB SITE IS LISTED BELOW IN SECTION "B".

A. If your inquiry was concerning the status of an application already sent
for an upcoming term, please note that letters concerning status or admissions
recommendations are always mailed directly to applicants.  The volume of
applications for each term is overwhelming at times, so please be patient
concerning the status of your application file.  Letters are sent as quickly
as possible.  Applicants will be notified of admissions decisions as soon
as they are available from the committee.  These are also sent via mail.

Because of security reasons, the department's policy is not to disclose the 
status or admission decision in any other way, except by regular or air mail.
No status reports or admissions decisions will be given on the telephone.
This message will be the only response you will receive via email concerning
the status of your file or admission decisions.

You may, if you wish, designate someone on this campus to act as your
representative concerning your application status or decision of our
admissions committee. To do this you must send a signed letter to the department
with the name of the person acting as your representative.  This signed letter
must come directly from you to the Department of Computer Science.  It
may be sent via regular mail or faxed to (217) 244-6073 to the attention
of: "Director of Gradate Programs".  It will be kept on file with your
application.  Your approved representative must appear in person when they
wish information concerning your application. There may be times during
processing when no information can or will be given to your representative
because of the nature of our processing.  Please make them aware of this.


B. If you are requesting application materials please note that we are no
longer able to send hardcopies of the application materials in the quantity
that we once did because of increased printing and mailing costs.  However,
the materials are available to download from our web site (www.cs.uiuc.edu).
There is a link to the Graduate College web site where the application forms
are also located.  They have made available the acrobat reader to allow
them to be downloaded and/or printed.  The only other piece of information that is required by the Department of Computer Science is an interest sheet. 
This is not currently available on our the web site.
The form will be mailed to you upon receipt of your application. 

However, in the event that you do not have access to a web browser, you may
make a special request for application materials by sending email to:
appls@cs.uiuc.edu.  Only one request necessary. No request that has a 
"invisible" mail header or multiple email addresses in the header will be
honored.  This service will only be for those persons who have attempted
to secure our materials through the web site and were unsuccessful.  
You must indicate in your request what difficulties you experienced in
downloading the materials or no packet can be sent to you. The materials
will be sent as quickly as possible, but may not reach you in time to
apply for a term if the deadline is close.
YOU MUST INDICATE THE DIFFICULTY YOU HAD IN DOWNLOADING THE MATERIALS TO
HAVE THEM MAILED TO YOU.



Application deadlines are always as follows:

        For a summer or fall term's consideration       January 15
        For a spring term's consideration               September 1

Admission to the CS department at UIUC is highly competitive.  No informal
evaluation or assessment will be done prior to submission of the official
application and materials.  Therefore it is the responsibility of the 
applicant to determine if they are within admissible range.  The final
decision for admission and financial aid is a committee decision.
Applications will be forwarded to the committee for review when all
credentials are received and the file is complete.  The decisions of
the committee are final.

You may, if you wish, submit photocopies of test scores such as TOEFL, TSE 
and GRE at the time of application.  Please be aware that official copies
from ETS will be required if your application is recommended for admission.
This is the policy of the university and the department has not authority
to waive the requirement.

The Computer Science Department has no authority to waive any of the 
university or state requirements, such as the application fee or 
TOEFL or TSE scores. 

A request for an application fee waiver must accompany the application form.
Be forewarned that the Office of Admissions and Records rarely grants a fee
waiver.  If no fee is received and no waiver is granted the application 
will not be forwarded to a department for admissions consideration.  It
is in your best interest to submit the application fee if at all possible.

The State of Illinois requires a passing TSE (Test of Spoken English) be
achieved prior to an award of a Teaching Assistantship (TA).  A passing
score is 50/60 on the new exam and 230/300 on the older version.  SPEAK
scores from exams taken off the UIUC campus are not acceptable.  A passing
score does not, however, guarantee an award of a TAship or any form of
financial aid.  TAships are the most common form of financial aid for new
Computer Science Graduate students.


C. If your inquiry is about the status of your I-20 form please note that
you will be notified by the Office of International Admissions directly to
confirm your current mailing address.  Upon return of the certification form
to Admissions you will be issued the I-20 form.  Also please note that the 
Department of Computer Science can not speed up the processing of the I-20 
in any way.  During heavy processing periods Admissions works as
fast as possible to finalize admissions and produce the necessary entrance
materials.

D.  All other inquiries will be answered as quickly as possible.
