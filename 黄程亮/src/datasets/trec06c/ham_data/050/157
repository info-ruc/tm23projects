 I think I'm going to add some more test modes, one more
millisecond callback testmode that just monitors the
callback when the clock is on for a response -- not that I
suspect it'll show up anything new, the callback already
functions a lot better that I thought it might but more for
the sake of completeness.  And in light of whatever article
that was recently that said DMDX couldn't do what it does
I'm going to add four new modes that monitor the latency of
the keycheck() routine that recieves keystrokes and decides
whether they are a valid response or not.  Normally this
wouldn't tell us anything, however if you say held down a
key so the keyboard starts the autorepeat function then you
could see what variablilty (if any) is present in keyboard
based RTs (as opposed to PIO and RawJoystick based RTs that
vary with to the millisecond callback) due to win32 as
opposed to the inherant variablility of a keyboard.
