I need some help please debugging a Runtime Error 03.  I have two blocks
of code that, if run individually, work fine. But if I run them both
together as processes, or one immediately following the other, the error
results. Because I am disabling pcode and using the serial port, I do not
have any more verbose info than what is displayed on the lcd.

The manual says this indicates an "array reference out of bounds". Does
this mean that data that does not match the defined size of a particular
array is being passed to it, or does it mean that an array reference is
too big for memory?  (i.e. - out of which bounds?)  Can anyone please
explain this error a bit more fully?

thanks,
Ken
