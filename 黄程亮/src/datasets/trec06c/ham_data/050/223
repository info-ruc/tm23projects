Dear Prospective Applicant:

Thank you for your interest in obtaining the graduate application
materials of the Department of Computer Science at the University of
Chicago.  

Please refer to our Questions-and-Answers list.

List of Frequently Asked Questions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  What graduate degree programs does the department offer?

	Ph.D. program and Master's program.
	The Ph.D. program was established in 1983.
	The Chicago Professional Programs in Computer Science
(formerly referred to as the Conversion Master's Program) was
established in 1997.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  What is the deadline for applying to the Ph.D. program?

	The deadline is always January 5th.  We will need to receive
your complete application by January 5, 2000, in order to consider you
for Fall 2000 admissions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  What is the deadline for applying to the Chicago Professional
Programs in Computer Science?

	The deadline is stated as March 1st for Summer Quarter
admissions, but we try to be flexible with that deadline.  The
majority of students entering the CPPCS begin in the Summer Quarter 
and take the full-time, intensive programming immersion courses.  
Applicants with a significant amount of prior programming skills 
might receive permission to have the summer course
waived.   May 1st is the deadline for fall admissions.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  What are the requirements for Ph.D. admissions?

	* Completed application, including Statement of Purpose
	* Three letters of recommendation
	* Official transcripts
	* GRE scores
	* GRE Subject Test scores (usually in Math or CS)
	* TOEFL scores (foreign applicants)
	* Any other supporting documentation you deem
		appropriate (e.g., copies of authored papers)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  What are the requirements for Chicago Professional Programs in
Computer Science admissions?

	* Completed application, including Statement of Purpose
	* Three letters of recommendation
	* Official transcripts
	* GRE scores

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  What are the TOEFL score requirements?

	For the computer based test, an applicant must receive a total
score of at least 213, with a score of at least 21 in each section.

financial aid from the department.  In return, those students often
serve as Teaching or Research assistants.
