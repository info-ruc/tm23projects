Dear Prospective Applicant:

Thank you for your inquiry about graduate study at the
University of California, Santa Cruz.  Please be advised that
UCSC greatly values the participation of scholars from diverse
nations and cultures in our various graduate programs, and we
therefore actively solicit applications for admission from
foreign applicants.  Unfortunately, recent fiscal problems in
the University of California have made it very difficult for us
to offer much financial support to foreign applicants.  (Departments may
recommend offers of available financial support based on merit.)  It is
strongly recommended that international applicants seek scholarship support
from their own government.

***To receive complete program information and a formal
application for admission, please write to us at UC Santa
Cruz, Division of Graduate Studies, 1156 High Street,
Santa Cruz, CA   95064.  Indicate the program to which you will
apply, and include an $8.50 (U.S.) money order payable to
UC Regents.  Applications and program information will not
be mailed until we have received the $8.50 money order.

You may obtain information on our graduate programs, general
application information and the links to complete an on-line
application or download an application at:

   http://graddiv-19.ucsc.edu/GradStudies/index.html

Graduate Admissions prefers to receive applications for Fall 2000 after
September 1st, 1999.  Because it normally takes much longer to process
international applications, you should submit your application well before
the program's deadline.

Information for prospective students from other countries:

Katelyn Haynes
