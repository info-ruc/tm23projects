in the United States. You will also find an atmosphere of academic challenge 
and a diversity of recreational and social opportunities. 

ONE GREAT UNIVERSITY--FIVE COLLEGE CHOICES
The five UCSD undergraduate colleges-- Eleanor Roosevelt, Earl Warren, Thurgood
Marshall, John Muir and Revelle bring our students the best of two worlds - the
friendliness of a small college and the resources of an internationally renowned
research university. Each of our colleges has its own identity and unique 
educational philosophy, traditions, general education requirements, residential
facilities and staff. When applying to UCSD, you will rank the five colleges in 
order of your personal preference. You may pursue any major regardless of your
college affiliation. Students from all colleges attend classes together and are
taught by campus-wide faculty. Additional on-line information about college choice
is available from the UCSD General Catalog at <http://www.ucsd.edu/catalog/>. You
can also visit individual web sites for the five undergraduate colleges. You will

I have tried to avoid contributing to this problem but it now
looks like it will go on forever if I don't inject one more
message.

The solution is NEVER SEND ANYTHING TO CSLIST@FUDAN.EDU

If you are interested in the "why" continue to read the message
I sent earlier.

I plan to send Mr. Gao a message that he and any other students
who use this time-wasting spam attack that he can forget about
receiving materials from Clemson.

>I have gotten two of these today. One from SUNY Buffalo and one
>from UCSC.  (I also got an "original" from China)
>
>As near as I can tell here is what is happening:
>Fudan has a mail distributer that Mr. Gao sends a message to
>and the distributer sends the message to EVERY CS grad program
>in the good ole USofA (maybe multiple messages!)
>
>Now if Ms. X       at SUNY or Ms. Y     at UCSC  or Dr. Westall
>at Clemson inadvertently
>sends their canned responses to cslist@fudan.edu rather than
>gyqin@fundan.edu... then their reply is reflected back to everybody
>on the original list and to make matters worse, Mr. Gao never
>sees it and so he may try again!
