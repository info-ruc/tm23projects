>Dear Prospective Applicant:
>
>Thank you for your inquiry about graduate study at the
>University of California, Santa Cruz.  Please be advised that
>UCSC greatly values the participation of scholars from diverse
>nations and cultures in our various graduate programs, and we
>therefore actively solicit applications for admission from
>foreign applicants.  Unfortunately, recent fiscal problems in
>the University of California have made it very difficult for us
>to offer much financial support to foreign applicants.  (Departments may
>recommend offers of available financial support based on merit.)  It is
>strongly recommended that international applicants seek scholarship
>support from their own government.
>
>***To receive complete program information and a formal
>application for admission, please write to us at UC Santa
>Cruz, Division of Graduate Studies, 1156 High Street,
>Santa Cruz, CA   95064.  Indicate the program to which you will
>apply, and include an $8.50 (U.S.) money order payable to
>UC Regents.  Applications and program information will not
>be mailed until we have received the $8.50 money order.
>
>You may obtain information on our graduate programs, general
>application information and the links to complete an on-line
>application or download an application at:
>
>   http://graddiv-19.ucsc.edu/GradStudies/index.html
>
>Graduate Admissions prefers to receive applications for Fall 2000 after
>September 1st, 1999.  Because it normally takes much longer to process
>international applications, you should submit your application well before
>the program's deadline.
>
>Information for prospective students from other countries:
