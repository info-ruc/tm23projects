	i just got bitten by this...

	% echo a'b'
	ab
	% echo fn
	fn
	% echo fn'b'
	fn b
	% 

A fix is to change the word: production in /sys/src/cmd/rc/syn.y from
	word:	keyword			{$1->type=WORD;}
to
	word:	keyword			{lastword=1; $1->type=WORD;}

And you'll have to add "int lastword;" to rc.h
so that lex.c's lastword is visible.
