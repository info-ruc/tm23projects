Depends on your mac.

For older mac, the printer or modem port works just fine.

For recent mac without any of these ports (like my iMac) you can use a USB to serial adaptor. The Keyspan (http://www.keyspan.com/products/usb/usa28x/)  just work. If you have an iMac the iPort (http://www.griffintechnology.com/imac/iport.html) also gives you a printer port. I tried both and both worked flawlessly.

All you need then is he correct cable to connect the 25 pins connector on your interface board and the mini-din connector on you mac. Check your local computer store, they should be able to help.

And if you buy your HandyBoard from Glasson, tell them you want the "mac version" and they will send you the correct cable and software.
