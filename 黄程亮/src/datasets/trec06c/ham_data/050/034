Paul,
	I'm not really sure if Oxy-Acetylene is a plasma by any strict
definition. However, there is electron transfer occuring, and I wouldn't
be surprised if the part of the flame where actual combustion occurs
reacts to RF just like the toothpick.  Maybe try making a coil attatched
to a transmitter and turn on the torch.

A couple more notes on this, esoteric, perhaps useful, perhaps not: (1)
flames do respond to electrical signals. At least as early as the 1960's,
there have been designs for loudspeakers which substituted a gas flame for
the coil and diaphragm of a typical loudspeaker; they required an additional
special amplifier and featured a pair of non-consumable electrodes
positioned in the flame. (2) RF transmitters can be quite simple in design,
and easy to build. I don't think you need much sophistication for this
experiment; just make sure the output either stays contained or meets FCC
regs.

Strictly speaking, oxy-acetylene (or any standard welding apparatus) is not
a plasma. There are, however, commercially available plasma torches. They
are quite expensive, but not as expensive as a commercial laser welder for
instance. A lot of work has gone on recently using RF heating as has been
previously mentioned. In fact, the only system that meets the definition of
high impulse and high thrust that is anywhere near operational testing is
based on RF heating (it is a huge microwave tube heating a standard
magnetically confined plasma). If you are experimenting on these lines, look
for information on VASIMR, however, I have found that a great deal of what
WAS posted on the web has been censored...and is no longer there!

If this is true, perhaps we can revive the interstellar ram jet idea...
