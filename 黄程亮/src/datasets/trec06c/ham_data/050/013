Fred,
	I'm no expert on plasma physics, but here are some ways that
immediately spring to mind:
	1) Spark gap + RF heating of the air.  Plasmas couple very well to
RF, and most of the energy gets turned into heat.
	2)High temp combustion + RF.  Sometime, bend a toothpick so that
it stands with one end pointing up, light that end, and put it in your
microwave. I think they're kind of pretty.  Also, the Oxy-Acetylene
reaction is the hottest type of combustion I know of, at a few thousand
degrees,  Kind of dangerous stuff though.
	3) In general, the more rarified the air, the lower the
temperature required for ionization.  Maybe run the air though a throat at
high speeed.

The hottest thing I recall seeing was a plasma torch, used to cut heavy stainless
steel plate. It used three kinds of gas, and I'm not positive what they were; I
think one was inert (argon most likely) and another might have been nitrogen (!).
This thing used a large welding machine for a power supply, likely pulling from
300 to 600 amps, and the welding arc created the plasma. Again, I'm uncertain,
but I'd guess at nozzle temps above 7000° F. Ceramic nozzle, water-cooled head
assembly. Call a welding supply shop for details. Oh, and get some good ear
protectors; these things make a hellish racket. Hope this helps you.

Fred,
	Do you mind if I ask what the application is?  I'm always
interested to hear 'bout other list members' projects.
Best Regards,

I tried the microwave method, and it's pretty cool, but I worry that it may
damage my 'wave.  Isn't a plasma not very different from a piece of tinfoil
in this respect?
