Don't forget the pullup resistor on the analog input....

Subject: Temperature sensing



I have both a Handyboard, and a miniboard. I would like them to be able to
sense the temperature of the air around them, so I have purchased some
lm34's. They are the caz versions. They are TO92 form factor. The output of
the sensor is a voltage. 10mv/F. In playing with it last night i got a
reading of 158 from the miniboard. Now, how do I convert this number to a
temperature? It was measuring the temperature of the room, which was about
78F. Now, I figure the 158 translates into a voltage of 3.098V. The
temperature range for the sensor is -40F to 270F. I think the following
formula should give me what I want: 


(40F+270F)/255 =1.05F per step. 

-40F is the offset value. 

My reading was 158, so I should be able to do the following: 

(158*1.05F)-40F=129F 


This value is, of course, not correct, but I think the process is. Unlike
the LM334 series sensor, there is no way to calibrate this sensor except in
the formula. My idea is to find the values of known temperatures, freezing,
and boiling water, and use that information to adjust the degrees per step. 


Is this a good way to approach it, or is there a better solution?
