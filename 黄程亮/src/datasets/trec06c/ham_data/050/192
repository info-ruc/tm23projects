As far as I remember, the IR program supplied with IC can ready sony remotes
without a problem. I wrote some code (long gone i'm afraid, but you could do
it easily) that printed to the lcd whatever code was received from a button
press. It's pretty easy, just a number between 0 and 255 depending on the
value. I'm not sure if it works for other brands of remote control through


hope that helps a bit
Adam
