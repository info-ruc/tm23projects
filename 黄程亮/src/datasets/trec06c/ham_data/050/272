Your damn mailing list "cslist@fudan.edu" is cluttering up the mail system
at every CS department in the US. Any student using this list will be
rejected for the following reasons:

	1. The student has done nothing to determine the quality of education at
any university on the list.

	2. The student is unethical in that he/she is wasting the time of hundreds
of people while knowing that there is little chance that any offer of
admission will be accepted, since only one of hundreds can be accepted.

	3. The prospective student is too stupid to parse a list so that every
recipient doesn't receive the responses from every other recipient.

Delete this list now.
