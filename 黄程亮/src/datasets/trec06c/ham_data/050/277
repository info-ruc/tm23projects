Why are people STILL sending email to cslist@fudan.?  Do you realize that
all this does is send your request to be off the mail list to EVERYONE else
on the mail list?

After receiving more than 50 email messages in less than two days
(TRUTHFULLY!), from people voicing their opinion and indicating they want to
be removed from this mail list, I seem to think that we are not getting
anywhere in stopping this ridiculously time wasting, vicious circle.

I did read an email from an individual that stated you should not send to
cslist@fudan because it is the distribution list and it will therefore get
sent out once again to each email address on the list (here we go again).
You should therefore SEND YOUR REQUESTS to root@fudan.edu.

EITHER WAY - I WOULD LIKE THIS ADDRESS REMOVED FROM YOUR LIST!!!!
