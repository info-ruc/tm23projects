It's a starship at relativistic speeds!!! A REALLY BIG One.

maybe

I would greatly appreciate it if anyone can give me a list of ways to 
convert plain ordinary air into plasma.  It does not have to be really high 
temperature originally, I can take care of that myself.  However, the power 
required to convert air into plasma has to be kept as low as possible.  If 
it is not possible to convert regular air, some alternatives would be nice.

Thank you,
Fred Reyes
