hi Mike,

thanks very much for your input.  I replied privately to
the first of the follow-up e-mails earlier today (from
the person in Utah), only to find three more in my in-box
when I got home from campus.

I am with the University of California, Irvine. We also 
ignore e-mail that is obviously intended for multiple 
recipients. (I once received a request for application 
and program information that had been directed to 137 
separate addresses. Please don't ask why I bothered 
counting; I don't know!)  Managing--or attempting to 
manage--the incoming mail from PRC and India is a major 
part of our daily efforts.

regards,

John Sommerhauser
Graduate Student Affairs Counselor
