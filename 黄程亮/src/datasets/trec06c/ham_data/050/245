> Thank you for your inquiry about graduate study at the
> University of California, Santa Cruz.  Please be advised that
> UCSC greatly values the participation of scholars from diverse
> nations and cultures in our various graduate programs, and we
> therefore actively solicit applications for admission from
> foreign applicants.  Unfortunately, recent fiscal problems in
> the University of California have made it very difficult for us
> to offer much financial support to foreign applicants.  (Departments may
> recommend offers of available financial support based on merit.)  It is
> strongly recommended that international applicants seek scholarship
support
> from their own government.

> ***To receive complete program information and a formal
> application for admission, please write to us at UC Santa
> Cruz, Division of Graduate Studies, 1156 High Street,
> Santa Cruz, CA   95064.  Indicate the program to which you will
> apply, and include an $8.50 (U.S.) money order payable to
> UC Regents.  Applications and program information will not
> be mailed until we have received the $8.50 money order.

> You may obtain information on our graduate programs, general

> Graduate Admissions prefers to receive applications for Fall 2000 after
