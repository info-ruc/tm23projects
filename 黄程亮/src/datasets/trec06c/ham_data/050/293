I will try again:

My contribution to the fudanspam was meant to be constructive. For the many
of you who didn't notice, the mail was addressed to the webmaster at fudan.

That address is:   <cait@vax.cs.hscsyr.edu>. 

Please forward all spam to the sob after deleting the >cslist@fudan.edu>.

I was trying to help stop the flow of garbage, but failed.

If we all go to the website and send nastygrams to the fudan alums, maybe
we can stop the madness.

Cheers.
