As you all might have noticed, the domain name   fudan.edu  has an email 
bouncer that reflects emails to all graduate admissions offices in the US.
The address of the mailing list is

cslist@fudan.edu

A message sent to that address is resent to all graduate admissions offices.
Please send complaints to  root@fudan.edu to terminate this ridiculous
practice. Please also complain to the organization of graduate schools.

Thanks.
J. Hammer
Professor and Graduate Coordinator
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
