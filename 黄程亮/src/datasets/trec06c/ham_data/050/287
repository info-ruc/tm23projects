Please realize that when you respond, you are only sending to the 
individuals on the list!!! You are not getting through to the actual 
culprit!!  As many of you, I am very busy and do not need anymore messages 
than I already receive.  It wastes my time and yours to have to delete all 
of these messages.  Thank you
