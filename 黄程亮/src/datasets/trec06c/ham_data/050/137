If I was approaching this first I'd check the spec sheet becaue it
probably give soem sort of formula to figure out the temperature.  If
not just do a series of tests...  Like Jim says it's most likely linear
so just take various readings at known temperatures and then derive a
formula form the slope and intercept of the line...  It comes down to
elementary math that way..

Cheers
