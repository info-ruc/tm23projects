I'm sorry  about your mail.  	I also am getting a huge amount of reply's 
from schools I did not send mail to.  Unfortunately, it appears I had a 
request from a chinese student and sent an automatic reply to him which he 
had going to a mail distributer.  It looks like we need to be more carefull
about not replying to what may look like a list.  The really stupid part is 
that this person won't even receive any replys.
