In order to serve our electronic inquirers more efficiently, the
University of Chicago's Office of College Admissions has restructured
its e-mail response system, making the address you have used obsolete.
To minimize our response time, we would like to shift as much e-mail
traffic as we can to the World Wide Web, and we ask that any
time-sensitive correspondence -- the kind in which a student might ask
to schedule an interview, request on-campus housing, reply to an
invitation, or check on the status of a file -- be conducted by phone
or by e-mail sent directly to the person the sender intends to reach.

Listed below are the options available to inquirers using the World
Wide Web or e-mail Please note that the url's are case-specific.

To request an application for admission and be added to our mailing
list, go to:
http://www-college.uchicago.edu/college/App-ad/request.html

To ask other questions that are not time-sensitive, go to:
http://www-college.uchicago.edu/college/App-ad/inquiry.html

If you do not have Internet access, you may use the e-mail address
below for matters that are not time-sensitive.  We advise you to use
it only as a last resort because our response time is apt to be much
longer than it would be for a message received via the Web.
