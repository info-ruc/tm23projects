IC code site: 
	Over 150 hits in less than ten days! I'm assuming that all that traffic
stems from the link to Fred Martin's main Handy Board page. (I hope I'm
not disappointing a lot of people by not having too much available yet).
I contacted the writer of the IR remote routines for permission to post
them, and hunted down a few more sources on IR control. Hopefully a
couple of days will bring IR remote code. I've also posted Jaron
Paludanus' shaft encoder tip (the first tip).

Kids Project Help:
	I'm organizing a middle school robotics project. The Idea/proposal
webpage is at
http://stu.cofc.edu/~jwpennin/robot/index.html
but the short and skinny is that the kids form different teams (not all
computer or science based) and work together to plan a robotics mission.
Has anybody here done anything like this before? I'd like some input
from experience. It started as just an idea to get college students into
the grade schools to play with/teach kids about science, but somehow I
got funding and interest, and now could use some advice.
