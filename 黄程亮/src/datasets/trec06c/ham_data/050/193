You could put in an E-series, and bump up the crystal a bit, but then
you wouldn't be able to use Interactive C anymore, 'cuz your baud rates
would change, and therefore you'd have to use an alternative assembly
or compiling environment.  They exist, but you'd make things much
harder on yourself by doing so.  If you want to stick with Interactive-C,
you're probably stuck with a generic Handyboard, 8-bit CPU, at the default
frequency.

If you're interested in other alternatives for development environments,
check out the Software pages on the Handyboard web site.
