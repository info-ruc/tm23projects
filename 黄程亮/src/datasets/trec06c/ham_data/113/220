Please come to class ready to present your lecture powerpoint in a small group situation.

Also, our class will create a podcast. I'll be collecting snippets of your presentations on Wednesday, taking pictures, and asking you to speak into my microphone. So, don't be surprised, and please let me know if I should not be taking pictures of you. c.
