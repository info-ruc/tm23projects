The character of Beloved is an infant in a mature body, to put it simply.  The supernatural manifestation managed to destroy every person’s life. Her seemingly malicious spirit, however, managed to pull the rest of the village towards the house of 124 and contact Sethe, as well as bring Sethe to her senses.  Generally speaking, ghosts are self-serving and driven for one purpose...which is to pass on.  So, the fact that Beloved's banished essence returns physically to get back at her murderous mother is a dramatic twist.
   
  Rambling seems to be the trend, so let us continue.  Beloved infiltrates a family teetering on the line of brokeness.  Okay...seriously...I can't do this anymore.  This is all I can say about this book that I didn't enjoy one second of.
