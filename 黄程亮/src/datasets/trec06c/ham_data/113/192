Don't forget that the scanner "discards" reps(TRs) at the beginning of a 
functional scan.  The default is 2 reps, but the scanner drift issue is 
really present a bit longer, so I changed the default to discard the 
first 6 reps.  Others keep the default of discarded reps =2, but then 
delay the start of stimulus presentation until the scanner drift issue 
subsides (6 reps) or fill this time with "dummy trials" since the 
imaging data will be useless (later you discard these trials at the fMRI 
data analysis stage).  The bottom line is that even if you've triggered 
the scanner w/ DMDX, you're start time for your DMDX program and 
acquisition of your fMRI data probably aren't synchronized, unless 
you've designed your DMDX program to account for discarded reps (again, 
discarded reps varies by people's preferences, so you'll have to check 
the defaults of the imaging protocol you're using).  If you haven't 
written DMDX code to account for this, then you'll need to change your 
COTs to account for this discrepancy as well.
