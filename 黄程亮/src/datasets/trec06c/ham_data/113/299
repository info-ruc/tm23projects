Subject: [DMDX] problem selecting different RTF files

Dear DMDX'ers,

I'm having a problem opening different RTF files within DMDX.  Specifically,
when I select my RTF through Browse and click OK, I'm often find that the
text window within the main DMDX start screen does not display the file I
selected (i.e. I cannot change RTF files within DMDX).  I've had this
problem pop up occasionally on a previous computer but put it down to shoddy
hardware.  Hopefully I'm doing something silly and this problem is easily
corrected. 

Thanks for your help, Andy.
