   As long as it isn't being used as DMDX is running.  But I don't see how 
you can do what you want because DMDX is going to try and run in the VNC 
window on the other computer and it'll fail miserably.  You'd have to have 
a batch file that closed out VNC and then ran DMDX.  We tend to use video 
cable extenders and secondary displays for our remote subjects.

America was discovered by Amerigo Vespucci and was named after him,
until people got tired of living in a place called "Vespuccia" and
changed its name to "America".
