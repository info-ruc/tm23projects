Networked Electronic Resources Librarian
Technical Support & Acquisitions


Columbia University Libraries invites applications and nominations  
for the position of Networked Electronic Resources Librarian. We seek  
a dynamic individual to coordinate and support the acquisition,  
processing, and maintenance of electronic resources for the Columbia  
University Libraries. Working closely with the Associate University  
Librarian for Collections and with Libraries selectors, this position  
provides an opportunity to participate in the development and  
advancement of networked electronic services in a collaborative  
environment.

Reporting to the Director, Technical Support & Acquisitions, the  
successful incumbent will coordinate the acquisition, processing, and  
maintenance of the networked electronic resources selected for  
Columbia University Libraries. Responsibilities include researching  
and analyzing vendor products and offers, reviewing license  
agreements, setting up trials and pilots, as needed, troubleshooting  
issues related to access and maintenance, and working closely with  
the Library Systems Office to conduct initial technical reviews. The  
Libraries have been a partner with Endeavor in the development of  
Meridian, and the incumbent will take a lead role in our local  
implementation.  In addition to assessing products, aggregators, and  
services, the position is expected to acquire resources and process  
changes and renewals, communicating with vendors to obtain the best  
terms and conditions available. In addition to the 1.5 FTE support  
staff reporting to this position, the incumbent works with a cross- 
section of Libraries staff to streamline the process for acquiring  
and providing access to electronic materials, to analyze and resolve  
problems, and to develop and use statistical and other management  
reports. This will include working with the Library Systems Office,  
vendors, publishers, and other members of various consortia regarding  
orders, terms, licensing, access, payments, and other performance  
matters. This is an outstanding opportunity to help shape the future  
of the Libraries networked electronic resources.

One of the world's leading research universities, Columbia provides  
outstanding opportunities to work and grow in a unique intellectual  
community. Set in the Morningside Heights academic village, Columbia  
also presents the unmatched dynamism, diversity and cultural richness  
of New York City. The University Libraries, grounded in collections  
of remarkable depth and breadth, are also building extensive  
electronic resources and services. The Libraries at Columbia are  
committed to collegiality, professionalism, innovation and  
leadership.   Annually the Libraries is devoting an increasing  
portion of its $16.9 million budget to electronic materials.  The  
percentage exceeded 17% last year.


Requirements are: an accredited MLS or equivalent relevant degree,  
and experience with electronic materials; knowledge of electronic  
services and licenses, bibliographic records, library automation, and  
web environments; knowledge of standard business practices, licensing  
terms, and the ability to apply that knowledge to electronic  
resources; the ability to work within a large, complex and changing  
library environment; effective written and oral communication skills;  
strong analytical skills; the ability to work in a collaborative and  
supportive manner with a broad cross section of Columbia Libraries  
staff; and knowledge of scholarly publishing & publications.  
Preferred qualifications include: supervisory experience, working  
knowledge of one or more European languages (preferably one Romance  
and one Germanic), including the ability to understand general  
business terms; previous serials or acquisitions experience at a  
professional level; experience in a large research library; and  
familiarity with licensing and Intellectual Property issues.

The salary for this PC-II position is commensurate with experience.  
We offer excellent benefits including tuition exemption for self and  
family and assistance with University housing.
