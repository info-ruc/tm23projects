You will have to provide us with the diagnostics.txt output so we can get 
an idea of what's happening rather than blindly guessing.  Of course it 
could be your use of ^ which indicates that no response is correct and 
perhaps DMDX is just throwing it all away.

until people got tired of living in a place called "Vespuccia" and
changed its name to "America".
