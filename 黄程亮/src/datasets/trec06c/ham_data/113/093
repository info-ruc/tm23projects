Not taking a position on this myself ;), but Richard Smith (former 
editor of BMJ) has been in the news again on this topic again - and I 
thought I'd just pass this reference along as a result.    The New Your 
Times did a piece on the broader topic of error in scientific 
studies/publications.  Here's the quote:

"The evidence against peer review keeps getting stronger," says Richard
Smith, former editor of the British Medical Journal, "while the evidence on
the upside is weak." Yet peer review has become a sacred cow, largely
because passing peer review confers great prestige - and often tenure.
