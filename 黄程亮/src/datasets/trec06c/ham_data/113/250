two points as a starter which got me until I got used to it:
=20
1. use ONLY MS Wordpad or Notepad to edit the files - other programs
(especially WORD) leave all sorts of rubbish as hidden commands which
DMDX can't cope with.
=20
2. make sure 'ignore unknown rtf' is ticked when you run the script !
=20
maybe if you're new, like I was until recently, those 2 things will help

=09
=09
	I am new to this program and not too computer savvy.  I am
trying to do an auditory only prime experiment with a sound presented,
50 ms silence, second sound, response format.  After carefully following
out how to write the script, it keeps telling me that is cannot read
some sort of text in quotes that looks like this:  /insrdr  However, I
don't have anything that even remotely resembles that!  Also, it is
having trouble with my MapResponse commands.  DMDX keeps reading that
there is a bracket inserted in the command.  However, when I go back to
the script, there is not.  I need assistance.  Thanks.
