   Definitely affirmative the second recommendation, I should change the 
code to make that the default option.  But I actually get more problems 
from users these days because they use WordPad or worse, Notepad.  With 
Notepad they bust some part of the RTF syntax that's about as opaque as mud 
and Wordpad has bunch of weirdnesses that just seem to get weirder as time 
goes by.  I personally have no trouble with Word but then I use it simply 
when manipulating DMDX scripts.
