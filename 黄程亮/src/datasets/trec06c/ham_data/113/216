Hello,

I'm trying to conduct a picture verification task using dmdx, and I'm uncertain
how to do the following: present a picture and sound simultaneously (or present
the picture slightly prior to word onset), without having the picture disappear
at word onset. The way that I've instantiated it (below) causes consistent
error messages saying that the picture "moved into video memory x ticks late,"
where x is a large 2-digit integer. I can only assume that this will adversely
affect the accuracy of RT reporting.

+201 *<bmp> “cat”/ <wav 2> “cat” <svp start>;

I'm sure there is a simple solution. Any ideas?

Sarah
