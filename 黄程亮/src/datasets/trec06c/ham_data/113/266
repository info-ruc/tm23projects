  Mrs.Shirley Yema GBUJAMA 
Minister Of Social Welfare,Gender & Children Affairs,
Sierra Leone

Dear One, 
With warm heart I offer my friendship,and greetings
and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However
strange or surprising this contact might seem to you
as we have not met personally or had any dealings in
the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration
of its importance and the immense benefit it will be
to you.
After careful consideration with my son,we resolved to
contact you for your most needed assistance in this
matter. I duly apologize for infringing on your
privacy,if this contact is not acceptable to you,as I
make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself to
you.My name is Mrs.Shirley Yema Gbujama,mother of
three and the Minister of Social Welfare, Gender and
Children Affairs and other Ministries for eight years
running.You may view my profile on the following link:

http://www.statehouse-sl.org/sygbujama.html

I will now give you a general overview of the
situation.When I was sworn in as a Minister of Social
Welfare,Gender and Children affairs in 1996, with my
influence,my husband Mr.Thomas Gbujama,a very
successful businessman was awarded several contracts
in my Ministry and had direct dealings with foreign
investors in this field due to my political status. I
was not involved in my husband's business,which was
very vast and successful.My beloved husband died
whilst on an official trip to one of his project sites
where they were attacked by rebels and killed and
their corpses were never found. 

When my husband died,I was contacted as next of kin by
a private security company firm in Europe to come
forth with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a
safety deposit my husband had in their Vault in his
name. At that time,my children and I did not have an
idea where the certificate might be.We then instructed
the Security firm to continue holding the safety
deposit until further instructions from me. Whilst
preparing for the second remembrance of my beloved
husband,I was going through his library collection and
to my astonishment I discovered a Certificate of
Deposit for the safety deposit with this private
firm,and other documents relating to the safety
deposit in a book.

The safety deposit,which is a trunk, is stocked with
hard-currency(US Dollars)totallying $24,500,000.00
which was generated from cash payments from his
business associates in the diamond trade from
Antwerp-Belgium. Though I knew my late husband was in
the diamond business,I did not have the knowledge that
he moved funds in cash and with my present position as
a Minister in this present government,it will cause a
lot of problem for me and my family cause if the
government should know of this cash;they might think
that my late husband has a hand in the Blood Diamonds
during the civil war in my Country so I had to move
this deposit boxes to a finance and Security company
in Accra-Ghana with the aid of my late husband's
friend that works with sceurity company telling him
that this funds belonged to my late husband's partner
and that we have been trying to locate him for quite
sometime now,as such I have contacted you to act as a
TRUSTEE to help me clear this deposit boxes from the
Finance and Security company in Accra-Ghana,and we
have decided to have this funds invested immediately
in commercial and residential properties abroad as
well as profitable ventures,as any member of my family
cannot hold such a huge amount in our name due to my
political status.

Hence we sincerely propose to you to render us your
most needed assistance in this regard. If you agree to
render us your assistance,your role in this project
will be to act on my behalf as a TRUSTEE to receive
the safety deposit containing the funds from the
Security Firm.

Though I believe this transaction should be based on
mutuality,my family's interest will be protected by a
family associate,who is a lawyer(attorney)attached to
the Sierra Leone Embassy in the country where the
Security Firm is located. He is now aware of the
safety deposit,and I have informed him that I am
locating one of my husband's business associates (you)
to handle the funds and invest on our behalf,as he
might be opposed to our decision if he found out that
I rarely know you. 

For your reliable assistance,we are offering
you,25%($6,125,000.00)of the funds. I want to thank
you in advance as we anticipate your assistance in
enabling us achieve this goal. On hearing from you,I
will forward to you all the necessary documents that
will assist you in clearing this deposit.As you may
understand,due to my sensitive position in the present
government,it is not safe to communicate with me via
phone or fax.This is why I have communicated with you
through my private email address and I will like us to
keep it this way for the safety of this transaction. 

Please contact my son Mr.Richard Thomas GBUJAMA Jr,on
his private phone number 00233 244 821 075 or
email:richardtg@myway.com,richard_tgbujama@freeghana.com
Whether or not you are interested in assisting us as
this enable us make alternative plans in the event of
non-interest on your part.

With Warm regards, 
Mrs.Shirley Yema GBUJAMA
