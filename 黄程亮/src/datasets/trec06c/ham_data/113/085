Available from ARL Initiative to Recruit a Diverse Workforce</font></font></h1>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Applications
for stipends to support graduate study in library and information
science in 2006-2008 are now available from the ARL Initiative to
Recruit a Diverse Workforce. Funded by the Institute of Museum and
Library Services (IMLS), the program offers a stipend of up to $10,000
(over two years). The Initiative also offers a mentoring relationship
with an experienced librarian and a leadership training curriculum for
MLS students from underrepresented groups interested in careers in
research libraries. The stipends may be coupled with other financial
aid to provide an extra incentive for completing library school. The
program also provides the opportunity to work in an ARL library upon
graduation. In addition to being funded by IMLS, the Initiative is
funded by voluntary contributions from 52 ARL libraries and reflects a
commitment to create a diverse research library community that will
better meet the new challenges of global competition and changing
demographics.</font></p>

      <h3><font

Class of 2005-2007</font></h3>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">On
January 21-22, 2005, the current class of 19 Initiative participants,
12 ARL Academy Fellows, and 20 MLS graduate student guests attended the
ARL Leadership Symposium in San Antonio, Texas. The two-day symposium
covered issues around transitioning into an ARL library, current issues
in federal relations a new librarian should know, and creating a career
transition plan. The highlight of the symposium was the "meet and
greet" reception where Initiative participants and guests connected
with ARL library directors. Having access to ARL Directors is paramount
to the success of the Initiative. If you are interested in learning
