Hello, all.

This is not about DMDX itself, but about Matt Davis' script to convert
.azk into .txt

I'm not able to make it work, because it gives me the following error:

gawk: ./getdat.awk:17:
' in expressionawk:17: ^ invalid char '


Has anyone tried this script, and did it work?

Thank you.

João
