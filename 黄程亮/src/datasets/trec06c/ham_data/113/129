Hi class,

There is an interesting talk that conflicts with part of today's
class, so here's the plan:

1) We'll meet at 3:30 as usual, and I'll lecture and lead discussion
    on the reading topics for today.  I'll also collect
    the written assignment -- please remember to bring it with you.

2) At 4:20, we'll end class, so that everyone can attend the following
    talk:

     Who:  George Cox/Intel
     Where: Taylor 3.128
     When: 4:30 pm
     Talk Title:   "Trustworthy Platforms: Problems, Promises Concepts,
     Practical Realities and Research Opportunities"

After that we'll be done for the day.  I considered trying to
reconvene after the talk, but I think that's too much reshuffling
for one day so I decided against it.

I strongly recommend that you attend George Cox's talk.  He is addressing
the other issue (i.e. other than parallelism) that is going to be critical
to the overhaul of architectures and programming languages over the next
ten years.

Some of the requirements imposed by trustworthy computing are
likely to constrain the approaches that can be taken to achieving
high performance via parallelism, so even if you're not interested in
trustworthy computing per-se, you should still learn something about it.

Bill
