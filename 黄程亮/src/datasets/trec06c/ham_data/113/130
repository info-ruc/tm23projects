FULBRIGHT International Human Rights Summer Fellowships

Organization: Humanity In Action
Application Deadline: February 7, 2006
Eligibility: Sophomores, Juniors, Seniors from US Colleges/Universities
Website http://www.humanityinaction.org

Humanity in Action sponsors six summer programs on minority issues in
Europe and the United States. This year we will select a total of 70
students from U.S. colleges and universities to participate in the 2006
programs. We are looking for applicants from all majors with a commitment
to human rights and minority issues. The 2006 summer programs will take
place in Amsterdam, Berlin, Copenhagen, New York, Paris, and Warsaw.
Because we are seeking to recruit the best of the best, we pay virtually
all of the costs of participation.

Humanity in Action (HIA) is a New York-based not-for-profit organization
that seeks to engage, inspire, and empower future human rights leaders by
giving them the opportunity to meet current human rights leaders in the
context of transnational educational programs. In each program, American
students work with an equal number of university students in the host
countries. (Note: European students from HIA host countries can also find
applications for the program on the website). Although each program
focuses on current minority and human rights issues in the host country,
in all programs students study histories and theories of resistance to the
abuse of human rights and the development of international human rights
doctrines and institutions in the aftermath of World War II and the
Holocaust. HIA engages Fellows in an ongoing trans-Atlantic dialogue about
the challenges that democratic societies encounter as they experience new
degrees and forms of diversity.

Upon completion of the summer program, HIA seeks to further the personal
and professional growth of participants by offering a network of Senior
Fellows (graduates of the program) in the U.S. and Europe, periodic
lectures and conferences, and eligibility for a variety of prestigious
internships (currently including the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia, Interpol, the U.S. House of Representatives, the
European Parliament, and others). Complete information about HIA and the
full range of our programs can be found on our website:
