Hello everyone.

DMDX is reporting errors in the .azk file. In particular, a frame that
contains an asterisk (before the presentation of an item in a masked
priming experiment) is systematically delayed after a response timeout,
or a response time that is close to the timeout.

It doesn't bother me much (or at all), because there are never errors in
the amount of time the prime and the target stay on the screen.

I was just wondering if it is normal, and about how I could solve it.

Thank you,

João
