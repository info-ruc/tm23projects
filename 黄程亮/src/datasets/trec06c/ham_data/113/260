Hi,
I'm new to the whole DMDX world, and have a few questions. I'm more or less
illiterate as far as computer programming is concerned, so any help anyone can
give me will be helpful. I plan on running my thesis experiment using auditory
input only. The stimuli will be short, sentences, "sung" to notes. I haven't
decided what, if anything, I want to appear on the screen. Possibly just icons
for response with the mouse, or maybe not. If anyone has run something like
this, I would appreciate any help.
Thanks,
Dennist
