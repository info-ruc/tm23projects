Chord and Tapestry:

         Like Pastry, Chord and Tapestry are ring-based structured 
peer-to-peer systems.  Chord is the most primitive of the three.  Unlike 
the other two, it makes no attempt to achieve network locality.  Chord does 
not use pastry's prefix-based routing, and as a result,  "finger pointers", 
and also a much smaller leaf set.  Perhaps in consequence, Chord's joins 
and leaves take O(log^2 n), which is asymptotically worse than Pastry's 
O(log n) Like Pastry, Chord does not necessarily heal properly after a 
network partition.
         In contrast, Tapestry is not clearly an advance over Pastry. 
Keeping one primary, and two secondary "neighbor" pointers seems more 
vulnerable than the k neighbors that Pastry keeps.  Spending a day trying 
to repair connections seems like a serious weakness if churn is 
high.  Pastry replicates objects, Tapestry leaves pointers.  Which approach 
is superior depends on the context.  On the other hand, Tapestry seems to 
search more widely for 'neighbors' with low network latencies.
