Hello all-

I am with Naperville CUSD 203 in Naperville, IL.  We are looking to
replace our hardware-based Esprit Language Lab this coming school year
when we upgrade the computers in that lab.  We are hoping to use a
software language lab in place of our existing system.  So far we've
researched both the Genesis and ReLanPro systems.  I did some research
in the Archives and learned about the SANAKO Lab 300 and SANS
Virtuoso/Soloist systems; I've already ordered the Digital Language Lab
Solutions publication offered by IALLT.  If anyone out there using any
of these systems would like to share their experiences with me, either
on the list or offlist, I would appreciate any insight you might have to
offer.  I'm a little concerned that one of the systems we are seriously
considering, the ReLANPro by ASC, isn't even mentioned in the IALLT
publication.  I'm assuming that means it's too new to have made it
through the evaluation process to get into the manual.
