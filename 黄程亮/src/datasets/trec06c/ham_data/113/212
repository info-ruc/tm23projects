Thanks, Scott!

In the scan protocol I am using, I set 6 extra shots before data 
acquisition.  Since my TR is 2000 ms, there is a 12-second period that the 
scanner is running but not saving the data (I know you are an expert, but by 
writing this out, I think you probably can detect if there is something 
wrong with my understanding of the timing).  At first, I thought I have 
accounted for the discarded 12 seconds by putting

100 <Output 254> c;

+101 *<o 255> %1 / <o 254> %1/ "READY" <fd 724>/;

where "READY" stays on the screen for 12 seconds (724 * 16.58 ms).  However, 
I took Jonathan's advice and ran the file again at the presentation computer 
and found something interesting.  Instead of getting 12037.08 ms (i.e., 724 
* 16.58 + 2 x 16.58) for this item, I got 14341.99 ms.  By further trying 
different frame durations, I was certain that before "READY" appeared, there 
was a duration of 2338.07 ms.  Thus, I'm a bit confused:

1. If Jonathan is right about where the scanner starts (<o 254>), can I say 
that I only have one tic (%1) asynchrony between the scanner and DMDX?  I 
noticed it today that the scanner did start before "READY" appeared, but I 
couldn't tell how many ms earlier....

2. Why is there a duration of 2338.07 ms before "READY"?  It means that two 
%1's equals to 2338.07ma (i.e., %1 = 1169.035 ms), which doesn't seem to 
make sense....

3. If the scanner does start at < o 254> and %1 somehow does equal to 
1169.035 ms, should I reduce my frame duration and make the whole duration 
of item 101 as close to 12 seconds as possible?

Any feedback would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks!!
