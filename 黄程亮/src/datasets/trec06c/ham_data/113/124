I had a question about my topic for the lecture assignment. I had an idea that i would describe what justice was, with the help of using the "Justice League" (Batman, SuperMan, etc) and using each of what they fight for to help explain justice and in each case what it means to them. If you could email me back with your suggestions on my topic or any insite i would really appreciate it!! thanks
