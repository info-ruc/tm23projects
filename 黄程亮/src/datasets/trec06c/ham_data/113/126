International not-for-profit offers free journal publishing platform for 
open access

Not-for-profit Scholarly Exchange, Inc. has eliminated one major obstacle 
for open access journals by providing a free and fully supported 
e-publishing platform.  Combining Open Journal Systems public-domain 
software with complete hosting and support, this new service offers 
scholars unrivaled freedom and flexibility to produce academic journals - 
and at a price that fosters the open access model.

Scholarly Exchange offsets its costs by contextually appropriate on-screen 
advertising, supplied by such sources as Google and Yahoo.  Revenues 
exceeding the basic support threshold of $1500 yearly are shared with each 
journal, to help defray editorial costs.

Journals that prefer an advertising-free environment may pre-pay the 
technology cost and enjoy the same platform benefits.

The 501(c) 3 public charity serves as a facilitator for open access 
journals rather than a publisher.  SE provides options with the platform 
for OAI harvesting and LOCKSS compliance.  The SE website offers 
information resources to help with archiving, ultra-low-cost tagging/data 
conversion, and short-run/print-on-demand services commercially available.

Using Scholarly Exchange's platform, scholars and researchers have a 
cost-effective gathering point, where knowledge is collected, evaluated, 
and then shared - without the expense and restrictions of traditional 
journal publishers.  Participating journals retain all rights to their 
metadata and content and may charge submission or publication fees to help 
defray editorial costs.

Scholarly Exchange plays no role in the creation of the information or its 
ultimate ownership, only in the sharing of the highest quality of 
scholarship as determined by the scholars who produce it.

The free-platform service begins February 15, 2006.

Scholarly Exchange emerged in 2002 to develop an innovative and 
cost-efficient electronic-first approach to scholarly publishing. It arose 
from the cooperative efforts of three university faculty with extensive 
experience in academic publishing, Julian Fisher (Harvard University), 
Yuwei Shi (Monterey Institute), and Mike Sosteric (Athabasca University) - 
all committed to the establishment of effective and affordable approaches 
to the sharing of knowledge among scholars. SE is an IRS-registered and 
-approved 501 (c) 3 public charity corporation with offices in Brookline, 
MA, Cupertino, CA, and Edmonton, AB.
