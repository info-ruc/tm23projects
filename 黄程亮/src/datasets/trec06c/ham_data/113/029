Thank you for your answers.

Yes, at other points I was getting the same error, and I fixed it by
adding a delay of 6 frames.

However, in this "asterisk situation", the delay is 29 frames (500 ms,
if we count the previous frame), and I still get the error.

I wouldn't like to increase the delay, and it only happens after a
(near-)timeout. So, because it is indeed 500ms for most of the trials, I
guess I'll just stick to it.

Thank you,

João
