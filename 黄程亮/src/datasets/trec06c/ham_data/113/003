Hi again,

Thanks for your advice regarding the sound files and reponses (Reply to my 
orginal email is below). I made the changes you suggested to my script re. 
multiple typed responses (see script below) but DMDX is still not 
registering any response. I tried running the script on a different 
computer with DMDX in case it was my laptop at fault, but the zil file 
still shows no response. Any other ideas at what might be the cause of my 
problem would be greatly appreaciated!

Thanks,

Rachel
