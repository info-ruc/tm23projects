Dear All,



In this weeks briefing for members:
  * Latest on the growing divide within UCEA
  * More money than expected announced by HEFCE
  * Student and political support
  * New campaign materials



As always please do pass this email on to all members at your LA -- with
less than two weeks left to vote it is imperative that we really push for a
high turnout now to send a clear message to the employers.



Best, Justine

Dear Colleagues,



Every YES vote weakens the employers position:

Talks between ourselves and the employers broke down last time when it
became clear that they were not prepared to discuss our claim seriously and
when they made calling off our ballot a precondition of any further
discussion. Despite this, AUT and NATFHE remain committed to a negotiated
settlement if at all possible. We have written to UCEA asking them whether
they do indeed intend to negotiate further, as they claim, and assuring
them that we are ready to meet them for serious discussion to resolve the
dispute. View the letter here:
http://www.aut.org.uk/media/docs/d/1/talkslettertoucea_jan06.rtf



However, the ballot result will be crucial in determining whether the
employers do come back to the table. We need the biggest possible turnout
and the biggest possible YES vote. We need a result that will send to UCEA
a clear message of unity and determination in our pursuit of a fair
professional wage.  The cracks are already showing. Members may recall that
during the last dispute, growing pressure on Vice Chancellors led a number
of them to lobby UCEA to get back into talks with the AUT. See the story
here:

http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=783



Now the signs are that the same may be happening again. UCEA met with
University personnel representatives last Thursday and while there are as
many accounts of what happened as there were institutions represented at
this meeting, one thing is clear: the employers are divided on how to
settle the dispute, with some wondering out loud what the point of UCEA
actually is if they are not prepared to negotiate.



Every vote strengthens our hand, and if the employers are divided let us
show that we are united and determined to secure better pay.



Scare tactics and foul play:

The employers appear to be getting more and more rattled and more and more
divided with every week. Some of them seem to want to sort the pay claim
out and the others want to make life as difficult as possible. Some are
even emailing each other to try and see if they can turn the dispute into a
money making exercise. Sadly for them, that email fell into the hands of
the THES and was splashed on their front page this week. Read all about it
and other news and letters in this weeks news digest here:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1514 Congratulations to the
member who correctly guessed one of the email culprits -- a prize is on its
way!



More good news for the employers:

Recurrent funding from the government for teaching by higher education
institutions in England will be increasing by 6.7% in 2006-7, the Higher
Education Funding Council for England announced this week. Although there
has been a cut of 69,000 in the full-time equivalent number of students
projected for 2006-7, the overall level of teaching funding has actually
gone up. The real terms amount of teaching funding (the unit of resource)
per student is £3,820 in 2006-7, not £3,490 as stated earlier by the
government in its 2004 grant letter. There will be a 17% increase in
funding to widen participation. The funding for teaching does not include
the additional money coming into higher education in England through top-up
fees. HEFCE also announced that recurrent funding for research in 2006-7
will be going up by 7.3%.



Student support:

NUS have been supporting our campaign by passing on a letter from Sally
Hunt and Paul Mackney to all Students' Union Presidents and by issuing a
joint article from AUT and NATFHE to student media contacts. Moreover, many
student papers have been covering this issue independently -- many thanks
to all of you for passing them on -- here is one example (from London
Student) which is certainly worth a read:
http://www.london-student.net/content/view/118/39/



Political support grows as MPs urge VCs to talk:

AUT general secretary Sally Hunt has this week met both the Minister for
Higher Education Bill Rammell MP and the Conservatives' shadow higher
education minister Boris Johnson MP. Having heard an update on the current
dispute both expressed their concern at the low levels of university
salaries and Bill Rammell reiterated that the government was increasing
funding into the sector in England and that one of the reasons why it had
introduced top-up fees was to improve university salaries.



Meanwhile, in the House of Commons, Labour MP and Education & Skills select
committee member Gordon Marsden has tabled an Early Day Motion (EDM)
supporting our pay campaign and calling on the employers to seek a
settlement. The EDM has already received cross-party support and we will be
writing nationally to all MPs next week urging them to sign it. The best
way of persuading them to sign however will be pressure from their
constituents so please contact your MP urging them to sign EDM 1540 -
University salaries (available here:
http://edmi.parliament.uk/EDMi/EDMDetails.aspx?EDMID=29961&SESSION=875 ).
The easiest and quickest way to do this is to email your MP via:
