   Probably the with the <O 254>.

   Dunno, I don't remember details of everything I've ever done.  People 
that use  the scanner regularly are going to have a better idea than I am.

   If what you say is so, yes.

   I would run the file again with a clockon in the first item and see what 
it is by item 1046 and add that to clock on times in the first run.
