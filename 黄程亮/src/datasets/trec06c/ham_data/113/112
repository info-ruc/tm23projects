The main idea of the paper is to organize peers in an multidimentional 
virual space. Similar to Chord, keys to data are uniformly distributed 
accross the participating peers using a hash function mapping. Nodes 
need to maintain links for their immediate neighbors only, so the size 
of the routing table is 2d. Routing in CAN takes O(n^1/d).

Node joins affect only O(d) nodes. CAN uses soft-state routing table 
updates. Absence of such update messages signals that the node has 
failed. The system does not have a good way of handling crashed nodes 
and can quickly become inconsistent when neighbors disagree on which 
nodes and up or down. In addition, an attacker can repeatedly report its 
neighbors as failed and thus easily disrupt the system.

Another problem with the paper is that the parameter d cannot be 
adjusted dynamically. The paper, however, provides good theoretical base 
and does address locality issues, replication and caching.
