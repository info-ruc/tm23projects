Hi Valerie;
I've been thinking about your question. I think there is a way to do
this well and a way to not do this well. Using superheroes may be a
good idea if it is coupled with well researched examples of ways
people have been unfair in history.

On the other hand, just saying that so and so superhero fights robbers
and stealing is unfair is not a good use. No. If you want to talk
about how big companies rob little businesses of their business, that
might be a good example—but—being specific and factuall in your
examples will certainly give you a higher grade (since, if you look at
the assignment, you get quite a few points for the quality of your
research). If you read about the history of superheroes, you'll learn
that they became popular during the depression when people were
feeling poor and like they were being treated unfairly.

I had an idea that i would describe what justice was, with the help of using the "Justice League" (Batman, SuperMan, etc) and using each of what they fight for to help explain justice and in each case what it means to them. If you could email me back with your suggestions on my topic or any insite i would really appreciate it!! thanks
