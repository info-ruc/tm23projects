Hobart has the schedule for RDV55

We generated the Mark5 procedure file locally using drudg.
We are using the .snp file generated by GSFC and picked up from cddis.
We will be recording mark 5 on a 2TB module.
Our drudg generated 178 tape labels! Possibly a known bug with drudg.
This is the first of this type of experiment which Hobart has been involved in.
We have tested the schedule. We note that 8 VCs only will be used. We
note that VC10 correctly patches to High using the IF3 switch.
We will ship the module to Socorro.

We are currently running OHIG42 which ends 30 minutes prior to RDV55.
The start of RDV55 is 5am local time.
We may not get the ready message out while setting up after OHIG42 but
all seems to be in place.
The observatory phone number is + 613 6248 5285
Paul van Tienen will start the experiment running.

Regards,
Brett Reid

Hobart has completed rdv55

The log from experiment rdv55 has been copied to:
ivsopar.obspm.fr:/pub/ivsincoming/
-----------------------------------------------------
Formatter (H-maser) leads GPS by 11.1837 microsec at 2006.033.18:01:19.02
Cable Cal 754.7 microsec longer delay.


Additional experiment notes:
Recorded 637 GB on Mark 5 module USN-0200/2000/1024 to be sent to Socorro 
using Australian airExpress (DHL).
We now have 12 modules remaining at the station after this weeks experiments.

Missed scans between 1006 and 1056. There seems to have been a problem
communicating with the antenna drive PC and then the PCFS crashed. Needed 
to restart both drive PC and PCFS machine. The printed schedule summary
had wrong line numbers as it was drudged differently to the .snp schedule 
file used. So the wrong line number was entered to restart the schedule
and it took 15 minutes for the schedule to catch up. The schedule ran OK
after this.

There are regular IF2 overflow messages in the log. The IF2 overflow
message did not occur after the schedule resumed normally. The reason for 
this is unknown at this stage but the S band pass bands looked similar
for both periods.
