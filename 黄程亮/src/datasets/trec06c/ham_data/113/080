Hi fine-grained parallelism class,

After talking to several students and recovering from my own deadline-induced
judgment malfunction, it is clear that the assignment I gave for this week
is excessive compared to the workload I'm aiming for in the seminar.

So, instead of reading all of Chapter 6 and doing all of the problems
this week, I'm splitting the work into two parts:

This week:
   Read sections 6.1 through 6.5
   Do H&P problems 6.5, 6.16a, and 6.16b.

Next week:
   Read the rest; do the other problems.

Later today I'll update the web page to reflect this change.

I apologize for any excessive stress that the original assignment
may have triggered already.

Bill
