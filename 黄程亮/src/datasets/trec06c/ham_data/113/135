LA/7711 Calculation of pro-rata contracts

When negotiating for the transfer of hourly-paid staff to pro-rata
contracts LAs will need to discuss with their employers how pro-rata
contracts will be calculated. This circular provides guidance to LAs on
this point and illustrates different approaches on the issue.  (3 pages)

Academic-related staff annual meeting, London WC1, Thursday 2 March 2006

LA/7699, sent out to LAs in January gave notice of the 2006 ARS annual
meeting.  To-date, very few members have been registered to attend.   LA
secretaries and local ARS representatives are reminded that this meeting is
an important opportunity to discuss the implications of the merger of AUT
and NATFHE for academic-related staff, and for members to be involved in
driving policy for academic-related staff in UCU from June 2006. There will
also be a focus on pay and the implementation of the framework agreement,
including any industrial action.



LA secretaries are reminded that members should be registered at
https://asp.artegis.com, using the login and password ARS2006 and ARSmember
by the deadline of Monday 6 February. LAs are also reminded that there are
six vacancies on the committee and again, nominations should be submitted
to reach HQ by Monday 6 February. We are also seeking motions, which are
particularly important this year, to inform the work of UCU on
academic-related staff issues and the same deadline for receipt applies.



Fixed-term staff annual meeting, 29 March 2006

LA/7701, sent out in January gave details of the 2006 FTS annual meeting,
and invited nominations for committee vacancies. Since this notice, an
additional one-year casual FTS vacancy has arisen and the following
vacancies will now exist from the 2006 annual meeting:



two 2-year vacancies for contract research staff members

two 2-year vacancies for fixed-term staff who are not contract research
staff

one 1-year casual vacancy for fixed-term staff who are not contract
research staff

one 2-year vacancy for a postgraduate undertaking paid duties

one 1-year casual vacancy for a postgraduate undertaking paid duties



Nominations must be agreed at an appropriate meeting, and received at head
office, on the nomination form, with all sections complete, by Monday 6
March 2006. A committee nomination form can be found at
http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/a/2/annmeetnomform06.pdf.



LAs are also asked to note that the deadline for registration in LA/7701
was incorrectly detailed as 17 January. The correct deadline for committee
nominations, submission of motions and delegate registration is Monday 6
March 2006.
