Laurie and Vince,

Please see Mike's message below.  I can't believe the difference in 
costs for the Samsung cameras.  We could buy lots of them for the price 
of one Wolfvision.

Carol,

Yes, the Wolfvision are very expensive (especially those particular models).
I am not a big fan of the Wolfvision for this reason.  Don't get me wrong,
they are very good, but I think there are other models just as good for a
fraction of the cost.

Dickran Parunak, Classroom Technology Coordinator at NCSU, has standardized
on a different model of Wolfvision in most cases.  However, I still think
there is another make that is comparable for considerably less.

My recommendation is the Samsung UF-80ST or UF-80DX.  Both are the same
footprint, with the difference being some additional features that are
included with the DX model (look at it as STandard and DeluXe).  My feedback
has been the additional features on the DX model are beneficial to the
education environment and the DX should be recommended in the schools.

Your cost on the DX model is $2169.
Your cost on the ST model is $1647.

I have attached a specification sheet on this unit.   Please call me with
any questions.  If you need a formal quote I can get that to you also.
Thanks Carol.

Mike,

Thanks very much for the quote.  Dr. Williams would like for you to
quote a couple of other document cameras that are several thousand
dollars cheaper than these two, if possible.  The Wolfvision ones
apparently are highly rated by users but they seem to be out of our
price range.  Can you recommend others that are of exellent
quality but substantially cheaper?

Thanks,
