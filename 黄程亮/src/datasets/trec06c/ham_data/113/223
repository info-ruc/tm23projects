Ah, I see!  I totally forgot that COT is between clock ons, not between the 
onsets of items!!  Silly me!


 To double check whether I am understanding this right, please bear with me 
with my script again:

100 <Output 254> c;

+101 *<o 255> %1 / <o 254> %1/ "READY" <fd 724>/;

+1001 "(instruction)"/ * <t 30000> "text" /!;



From the above script, I should at least get 2*16.58ms + 724*16.58 ms+ 
90*16.58 ms (the period of "(instruction)" in item 1001, whose frame 
duration is defined in the parameter line as <fd 90>).  All these add up to 
13529.28 ms.  Since I got 14341.99 ms from the data file, I probably had 
812.71 ms that came from the delay between items 101 & 1001.  Is that 
correct?
