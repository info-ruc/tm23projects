I was wondering if you have graded my resubmitted 4 slide assigment yet. I have replied to my original thread twice and was wondering if you have gotten around to grading the last reply that i  have submitted after looking at the corrections. I have a grade you left for us on it, but i am not sure if that is from the first reply or the second after the corrections. If you could email me back that would be great. thanks
