  I ended up liking this book more than disliking it, which was a little bit of a surprise because throughout the book I was really frustrated with the language and the way Toni Morrison writes. The main thing that made me dislike this book though (besides the comlex language and abstract format) was the ending, primarily the last chapter. In fact I was quite happy with the ending until I read the last two pages. The second to last chapter was terrific, I felt it really tied up some of the loose ends and brought the characters together in a positive way, and after reading that I was perfectly content with ending it right there. Then I read the last two pages n it seemed to kill that feeling, that perfect ending. Part of that probably has to do with the fact that I'm kind of a romantic, so the fact that it ended with Paul D. coming to save and take care of Sethe, to show her her true worth, was a good ending for me. But also the last chapter seemed a little abstract and hard to
 follow, and although it was fairly consitent with the language of the rest of the book, I felt it made for a bit of a rough ending, one a little too intricate and complex to make a smooth finish. In a way it seemed fitting because that was the way the rest of the book was written, but also it seemed like such a complex book should have a relaxed ending, not one that left you as confused as I felt this one did.
