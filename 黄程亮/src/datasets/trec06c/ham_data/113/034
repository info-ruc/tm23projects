Subject: kind of a response to Brittany's Denver question

This is interesting because I was actually right  next to Brittany when she was writing this, and she was saying that  several graduated students had often talked about how they could not  stand Denver.  Honestly, I would like to know why.
  
  In the end, and in other points of the book, it's almost of as if this  becomes solely Denver's story.  She is often portrayed as the  "watcher" and skeptic of the story as she hesitates to trust any  motives by the other characters in the book--including Paul D, Sethe,  and eventually Beloved.  She often seems to know what exactly is  going on behind the scenes of the events.  She constantly is  caring for the well-being of herself and those whom she loves, and she  does this by being skeptacle of those in the novel.
  
  As Brittany said, Denver grows into a woman by the end as the "truth"  (or how it is portrayed in the book) finally starts to come into focus  and she realizes who is to blame for the instability and unbalanced  family--Beloved.  While Denver is growing into a mature and  clear-sighted woman, Beloved is growing too, but in a different  way.  Beloved has many qualities similar to a baby's in the  beginning, but those characteristics slowly deteriorate as she becomes  somewhat selfish, needy, and manipulative.  What Toni Morrison is  trying to say with this contradiction of portrayals, I don't  know.  Perhaps someone would like to respond.  Perhaps, she  is saying that dwelling on your past so much, in such a way that Sethe  does, can negatively control your life, which you must  confront--without overdoing it--and release.  I say this because  Beloved seems to symbolize Sethe's past, and the longer Sethe keeps her  around, the more Beloved controls Sethe and directs her attention
 away  from her present day life and what's important.  Dwelling on the  past can have the same effect. However, I believe Toni Morrison does  not advocate the idea of completely shutting out what has happened, as  we can see with what she has shown with Paul D.
  
  Kara.
