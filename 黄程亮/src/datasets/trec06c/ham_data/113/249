I am new to this program and not too computer savvy.  I am trying to do an auditory only prime experiment with a sound presented, 50 ms silence, second sound, response format.  After carefully following out how to write the script, it keeps telling me that is cannot read some sort of text in quotes that looks like this:  /insrdr  However, I don't have anything that even remotely resembles that!  Also, it is having trouble with my MapResponse commands.  DMDX keeps reading that there is a bracket inserted in the command.  However, when I go back to the script, there is not.  I need assistance.  Thanks.
