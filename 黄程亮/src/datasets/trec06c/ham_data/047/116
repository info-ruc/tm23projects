I have a problem getting handy board into bootstrap mode. I'm now in the
face six (installing lcd screen and downloadin ic). It worked earlier, but
now it just won't go into bootstrap mode. I have tested the switch and
traced wires from it to the prosessor, and there is nothing wrong with them.
I have no clue what could be wrong.

Thank you in advance.
