  Sorry for that post about DDS2:Blt() failing, that was supposed to go the
DirectX list...

  I have released 1.1.04 that includes the following:

	The DigitalVOX input device no longer stops the capture buffer immediatly
after a response is detected.  You can use it by itself (no need to include
the RecordVocal device as well) now but it will always leave the capture
buffer running for the response time limit (like RecordVocal) meaning DMDX
won't go on the the next item or respond to a request until the response
time limit is reached.  It'll stay that way until I dramatically re-design
the code, you may want to pick a smaller response time limit if the ISI
starts being a problem.
	Fixed missing quotes making scramble report a missing $.
	DMDX always clears the backbuffers on abort/save dialog.  Stops multimon
screens leaving something from n frames ago on the screen when job is stopped.
	S3 ViRGE PCI 325 (not the DX/GX) video card feedback clearing problem
kludged.  The machines in Ken's lab could somehow not display the frame
that cleared the feedback message, instead whatever was in the video memory
buffer from n frames ago (like 13 frames ago on a 4M video card) would be
left on the screen.  I have made the generation of both those messages (the
feedback and it's erasure) grab the critical section that stops the display
queue from being manipulated and this seems to fix the problem.  My guess
is that the flip of the first frame was somehow cancelling the blit of the
erasure, like I say somehow because there are much more rigorous tests that
those machines pass (like twenty 1 tick frames right after each other where
at least 7 frames are being blitted while other frames are being flipped).
Once again, the error was only seen with those S3 chips, the S3 DX/GX
version I have doesn't display the error, but it's also in a 300MHz K6
machine, it could still be CPU speed dependant.
