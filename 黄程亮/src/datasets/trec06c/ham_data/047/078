Jerry and Mike,

Things appear to have run rather smoothly over the night.  The throughput
was about 100,000 events in 9hrs (this was a 4Gev electron run)...so
about 1/4 million events per day.

I cleaned up my two scripts (gsim.batch and mk_gsim.batch) a bit and am
testing them out now...

Once I get all the /scratch and /data disks properly exported I'll work
on a script to collect the data from the local disks...(this will probably
tonight)

Arne
