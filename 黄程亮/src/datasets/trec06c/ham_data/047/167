     What version of IC are you using? I had all kinds of serial port
troubles with the freeware version running on fast (Pentium and up)
machines. The commercial version runs well on fast machines under Win95,
has a slick interface and is cheap. If you are spending any time at all
with the HB (and isn't that the point?) it is well worth the investment. It
saves much time and hassle. See:

Not sure what you are asking. The adapter is used to charge the battery,
which can only work if both are connected to the HB. You can use the HB w/o
the battery but you'll have to reload the pcode after every time you turn
it off. And your 'bot will need a long umbilical 8^]
