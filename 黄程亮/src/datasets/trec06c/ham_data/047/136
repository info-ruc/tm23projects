  A slight oops was discoved today that is revealed by DMDX's stubborn
insistance that some other process has exclusive access to DirectSound and
that it's can't therefore get exclusive access (and so no sound is
available in DMDX).  And try as you might you can't find anything else that
might have exclusive access to the sound card.  The problem occurs because
previous versions of the Sound Driver selection dialog in TimeDX
incorrectly indicated what the currently selected device was, they always
left the selection as the last device, not good as the last device is
rarely the desired one and if someone presses OK, voila, no more sound.

  The problem didn't surface until recently as there was rarely more than
one or two devices to choose from until DirectX 6.1 came along.
