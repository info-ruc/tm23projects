Many people use trial and error to come up with a wheel differencial factor that
should always be applied so that even without looking at the encoders the robot
should move pretty straight. If you do the compensation on the fly that is OK
but during turns and such you may be turning too much or not enough without
adding in this factor. This factor would normally be stored in nonvolotile RAM
or eeprom for future use, too.
