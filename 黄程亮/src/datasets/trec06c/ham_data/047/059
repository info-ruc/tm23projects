Is there anyone who has written or seen IC code that will keep a robot
moving straight with 2 DC motors and four side sensors?  2 on each
side.  The main reason I ask is because one of my DC motors seems to put
out more power that the other one and this moves faster  and my robot
like to turn into walls....

I'm using the analog sensor inputs with IR sensors - the values range
from 0-255
255 being can't see anything, and 0 being right against a wall..

I was thinking something like - if back left > 128 speed up left motor
or decrease right motor speed and similar scenarios for the other
sensors....

I'm asking just to save myself some time....  If anyone can help that'd
be greatly appreciated!!

Cheers
