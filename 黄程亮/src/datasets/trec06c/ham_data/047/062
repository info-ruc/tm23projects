Sean ...

Probably the best way to maintain a constant heading is to use shaft
encoders on both drive wheels ... monitor their rotation ... adjust
one motor to give identical turn counts.

The book "Mobile Robots: Inspiration to Implementation" by Jones,
Flynn, and Seiger provides a description of this method complete with
IC code examples.  IMO this book is an absolute essential for anyone
using the HandyBoard ... at least until Fred Martin's book is finally
published.
