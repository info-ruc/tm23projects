hi there

i'm not yet receiving this list so could any replies please not leave
out my direct email.

my problem is thus.

i've got 5 of the hb's analog ports used by ldr's. they all work fine
and have done so as line detectors for 3 years now.

i have just recently ripped a mouse apart and am trying to have a shaft
encoder.

this has also been successful to a certain degree. using the hb
fencdr0.icb i get a nice velocity and everything is fine with the
encoder part.

however i've found that having the fencdr0.icb loaded the ldr's which
are attached to the other analog ports are returning wild readings. if i
manually in ic, read the sensors analog(1); and such they read back ok.
but since i have my sensor code in a spawned process maybe this has
something to do with it??

so i'm assuming that the fencdr0.icb is somehow interfering with the ldr
analog readings. spurious readings mean no robot = can't have encoder
running at the same time. bugger.

has anyone else every run across this problem. i did a search using the
cool mailing search provided and was a bit swamped.

thanks
aaron.
