I think the serial board is working fine. I tried the loopback test as
mentioned in the
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/faq/winindex.html
and everything seems ok. My concern is that since the green and Red LEds
on the HB don't seem to come one (EVER blink or otherwise) I am wondering
if the HB  could be bad. Or simply the leds burnt out.

	I have sent my HB back to the manufacture and he said that he had
fixed some parts and the board is new and good working order. So is there
anything like the loopback test to find out if the HB is recieve data? I
am frustrated as I have spent quite a few hundred dollars and I can't even
get the board to work. Moreover, shipping to the manufacturer also is
expensive.

	Is the loader board the board the links the PC with the HB via the
RJ11. If so then it is working fine.

	Thanks for the tips and I shall keep trying.
