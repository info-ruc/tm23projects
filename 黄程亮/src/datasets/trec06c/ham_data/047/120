Anybody catch the segment last night on the robotic wheelchair.  I think 
it was on Dateline.

Watching it climb stairs was impressive, but seeing the chair stand 
upright on two of its four wheels while the occupant caught a 25lb sack 
of lead, all without the robotic chair even appearing to correct its 
balance was amazing.  The inventor must have one fast controller, lots of 
accelerometers, and some very fancy code to do that!
