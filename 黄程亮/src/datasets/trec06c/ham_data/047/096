We had been building a handyboard(hb) but we have severe problems,

We download the buffalo using  the hbdl windows downloader (dl indicates a 
serial timeout, dlm just hangs up).
When Buffalo is succesfully loaded (it sometimes halts with a error in 
address 0x0000)and a power cycle is made the memory is lost. If we connect 
pin 17 of the HC11 (reset) to GND instead of a power cycle the system resets 
and the buffalo prompt is displayed. Buffalo seems to be working as the help 
and load commands work properly.I tried making a block fill to the motor 
outputs. The command is carried out successfully as the motor leds light up 
correctly. Unfortunately, the buffalo prompt is not displayed again 
afterwards.

I then tried loading the IC pcode. When I power cycle the noard and run IC 
the program indicates a board not present. If I reset the chip without a 
power cycle and then run IC, it just hangs up without displaying a message.

If it is of any help, our current computer is an AMD K6-2 at 300Mhz with 
48Mb RAM.

Please help! We are supposed to deliver a fully working handyboard by the 
end of the week as a school asignment.

Fernando

Thanks, we hope to hear back from you soon!
