I think everybody had that problem at first, because the default setup for IC tries to use that file.  The pcoder22.s19 is not supposed to be used for the HandyBoard (I think it's for the MIT robotics course).  Your HB needs the pcode_hb.s19 instead.  Unfortunately, I can't remember how to change the setting.  Anyone else?

BTW, you might also have trouble with lib_hb.lis at first, too.  It is automatically read when you start IC, and it lists the files to be auto loaded.  It includes r22_ir.lis, which will try to load r22_ir.icb & r22_ir.c, both of which are incompatible with the HB., so just edit the lib_hb.lis file to remove the reference to the r22 stuff.  Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.  Good luck!
