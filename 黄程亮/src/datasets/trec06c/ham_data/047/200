Hello,

	I am getting a message when I try to connect with the board that
says
		 "Cannot find \ic\libs\lib_hb.lis"

	I loaded a program onto the handyboard from my computer at home-
everything looked good.

	When I brought it in, I tried to connect here and got that message.
I looked in the libs directory and lib_hb.lis definitely exists.  The
problem is not with the board but somewhere in the path I think... 
	The path on this computer is C:\IC\IC\LIBS\lib_hb.lis

	Maybe I should eliminate the first IC directory????
Thanks
Bill Landahl
