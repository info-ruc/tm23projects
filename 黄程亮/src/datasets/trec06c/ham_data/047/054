Don't feel bad.  I felt the same way.  My background is in PC Windows
programming, and this is very very very different and frustrating to get
started.  If you are still interested you should consider buying a board
that is already assebled.  Thats how I started.  Yeah, you spend more money,
but their is so much to learn that its hard to start at the bottom.   The
Handy Board is the best, easiest board around.  I know it doesn't feel that
way now.  But once you get the hang of it, you will be building your own
boards.  You can always just put it aside and come back to it when you have
the knowledge that you need.  I did that to, what can I tell you I was
GREEN, then again I think I still am when ever I talk to some of the people
or read some of the emails.  Its like WOW, all I know its how much I don't
know yet.  :) )

If you still want to sell the boards let me know, I would be interested.

Good Luck


Carlos
