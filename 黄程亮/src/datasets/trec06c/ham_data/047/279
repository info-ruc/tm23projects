We are pleased to announce the creation of a Conceptual Graphs Workbench
available on the Web at: http://www.larflast.bas.bg:8080/.
The features supported by the current implementation include:
- Browsing and searching a CG Knowledge Base.
- Editing Conceptual Graphs in display form (creating, modifying CGs
through drag and drop of concepts, relations, contexts, etc.)
- Importing from CGPRo format to display form.
- Exporting from CGPRo to CGIF. (Comments are welcome, the module is not in
a final version.)
- Exporting from CGPRo to First Order Predicate Calculus.

More information is available at the Web site. After a couple of days, user
management will be added to the system.


Note: From that site you may access a Natural Language Generator form
Conceptual Graphs. It generates paragraph-long NL answers to questions
about objects in the KB of CGs in two languages - German and Bulgarian.

Instructions for use:

In order for the applets to run properly (The Type Hierarchy browsing and
the CG Editor are implemented through Java applets) the library swing-1.0.3
has to be downloaded from java.sun.com 

Installation:

1. For Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator set classpath to point
to swingall.jar
For example: set classpath=d:\swing-1.0.3\swingall.jar;% classpath%
This line can be added to Autoexec.bat or in System/Properties (for Windows
NT)
2. For Netscape only you can copy the file swingall.jar into the classes
directory of Netscape.
Note: For some versions of IE you must have classpath pointing to
classes.zip from JDK 1.1.x because the classes from the RMI packet are
missing. 

Please send any comments to pavlin.prosyst@nat.bg or p_dobrev@prosyst.com
or kris@lml.bas.bg (for CGIF and FOPC forms).
