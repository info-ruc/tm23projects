The output pin of the LM35 gives you the ambient temperature in 10mV/degree
C directly. The 47k pullup resistor will form a voltage divider with the
output. You either have to do some conversion (complicated) or eliminate the
pullup (easy)....

I have a couple of LM335 that I have tried to use with the miniboard. The
numbers I get when converted to Fahrenheit, do not accurately represent the
room temperature. The docs mention using a 10K pot to calibrate the sensor.
I have not yet tried this, but it is my next step. The Robot Bonanza book
has a couple of circuits that use this sensor. I have not tried either
circuit from the book. I do have a handyboard, but I have not tried the
sensor with it, but the results should be that same with either board. They
both use the 47K pull up resistor.
