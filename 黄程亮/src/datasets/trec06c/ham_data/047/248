Does anyone here have experience with the NetMedia Servo 8 Torque
controller board.  Available from:
     http://www.web-hobbies.com/servo8t.html
at $60 post paid.  It controls up to 8 servos and provides position
and torque feedback for each servo upon request.  Looks good for
my walker.

Any comments about Scott Edwards SSC2 controllers?  $44 plus shipping
from:     http://www.seetron.com/ssc.htm

My current walker is a 3 servo guy that only does a tripod gait ...
no need for servo controller or torque feedback.  My new guy with
six 2-DOF legs would probably benefit from position and torque
feedback info.  Comments?

thanks,
 - Nick -
