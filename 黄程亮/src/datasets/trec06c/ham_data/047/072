I use the 9 gram Piezo gyro in my Hand Launch Glider to keep it moving
level despite strong wind conditions.
Could you use that in your robot as a "Rudder" input? The 9 gram Piezo gyro
costs about 9,500 yen here in Japan.
That is about $80.00. I think there are even cheaper ones out there, but
they are a touch heavier.
