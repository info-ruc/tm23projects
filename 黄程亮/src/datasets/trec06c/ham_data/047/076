I have a couple of LM335 that I have tried to use with the miniboard. The=
 numbers I get when converted to Fahrenheit, do not accurately represent the=
 room temperature. The docs mention using a 10K pot to calibrate the sensor.=
 I have not yet tried this, but it is my next step. The Robot Bonanza book=
 has a couple of circuits that use this sensor. I have not tried either=
 circuit from the book. I do have a handyboard, but I have not tried the=
 sensor with it, but the results should be that same with either board. They=
 both use the 47K pull up resistor.
