  I am considering removing the code in DMDX and TimeDX that deals with
machines without high performace timers, old legacy hardware in the 486
catagory.  I don't think anyone uses such machines with DMDX and removing
code that doesn't deal with microsecond accurate timers will lead to
considerably more accurate decisions about whether a frame has missed it's
allowed time or not.  If anyone does use machines without high performance
timers speak now or forever hold your peace.
