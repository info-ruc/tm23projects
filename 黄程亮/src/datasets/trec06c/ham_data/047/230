  I've released 1.1.06 which:

1/ Fixed the FEEDBACKDURATION and FEEDBACKLINE keywords, they were
documented but not available.

2/ Made movingimages() sleep if it's not moving images into video memory
which might reduce some pre-emption problems, basically lets the rest of
the machine do other things when DMDX is not so busy.  Previously DMDX only
slept at the start of an item.

3/ Stopped movingimages() from moving stuff (with Blt, the BLock Transfer
function) if a Flip has not completed as the blt will be queued and then go
to the wrong buffer.  This fixes the S3 problem in Ken's lab which wasn't
related to the video card at all but instead the P166 processor was at
fault.  Basically if the CPU is slow enough the erase of a feedback message
can wind up not being moved into video memory before the Flip of the
feedback itself and the erase winds up in the wrong place leading to all
hell breaking loose with the display.  Once again, this only cropped up
with feedback and on slow machines, if you didn't see it it wasn't
happening as the results were fairly catestrophic.

4/ I made the About box a bit fancier, centered all dialogs, disabled
screen savers and monitor power off programs.

  1.1.07 will include a new input device that will poll joystick buttons as
fast as pio12 buttons (read as fast as possible), the catch being the
joystick must be an old fashioned analog thing on port 201H.  It won't work
on NT or win2000 (like the pio12 input device won't) nor will new fangled
joysticks work with it, you'll still have to use the DirectX devices for those.
