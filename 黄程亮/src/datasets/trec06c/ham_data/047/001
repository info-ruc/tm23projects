I'm having the same problem with my expansion board.  When I type 
sonar_display(); the numbers start flashing on the LCD.  The numbers are 
changing rapidly and appear to be both negative and positive. The numbers 
seem to be random as well. I made sure that the init pin matched the init on 
the expansion board.  I checked the other pins as well.  I tried replacing 
the chips but couldn't even order any because you have to order a minimum of 
25 or 50 at 5$ each.  I order the 40$ circuit board instead and hooked it 
up.  The new board is doing the exact same thing.  Please help.
