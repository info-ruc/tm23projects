thanks fred.

i'm now using the servo_a7.icb routines to drive my servo.

i am still experiencing problems with the analog ports.

i have cascading if then else statements that yield varying responses
from my 5 analog ldr's. i have put printf's throughout these statements
to work out what is going on.

with the fencrd0.icb file loaded the other analog ports randomly produce
values on them.

i've turned off my servo (removed servo_a7.icb from the startup) for now
until the analog ports and fencrd0.icb are sorted out, and the problem
is still there.

since the fencrd0.icb reprograms the a/d port. could it be reprogramming
it all the time hence the bogus values on the other a/d ports?

i have replaced the 47K res pack with 100K for a better voltage divider
on the ldr's. i can't see that causing it any problems.

i've tried a different handyboard to rule out a hardware issue.

i don't even have any code for the fencrd0.icb to use yet. it is just
loaded at startup.

any ideas?

thanks.
