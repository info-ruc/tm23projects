I connected my 6500 series sonar ranging module to my expansion using the 9 
pin connector.  I called the function sonar_display() and got a clicking 
sound.  The numbers being displayed to the LDC are between 1254 and 1301.  
Moving an object to and from the transducer doesn't seem to have an effect 
on the numbers being display to the LCD.  By the way, I did connect J12 to 
digital input 7.

Did I do everything correctly.
