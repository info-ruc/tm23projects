well once again i've learnt the hardway. always get the latest software.

downloaded the new libs, and that fixed me up. i was using the libs from
when i first started with the hb (years ago).

all my analogs are stable again. 

i am very happy. my robot can continue to improve. yes! :)

thanks fred.

ciao.
