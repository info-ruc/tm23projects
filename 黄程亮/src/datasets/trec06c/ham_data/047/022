Dear All,

            I have a question on the operation of the Handy Board motor =
outputs which i do not understand. As deduced from the schematic =
diagram, I believe that the HC374 chip clock input is connected to a Y6 =
terminal. This Y6 terminal is one of the outputs of a 74'138 decoder =
which will trigger when a value is poked to the address 0x0e. Based on =
the diagram, I would expect Y6 to be active only when A15 is low while =
A14, A13 and A12 are high, but this doesn't correspond to the address =
0x0e right? Am I wrong in interpreting A15 as the most significant bit? =
Also, is the 0e (in hex) unique in IC only? I can't seem to figure why =
is there a preceding 0.
            Also, I am currently modifying the Handy Board to support =
more motor outputs and is intending to tap Y0 terminal to a HC574 chip =
(clock input) on the new board. What address should i poke to? Sorry, =
sounds trivial but didnt manage to find any answers on the web.
            Would appreciate help/advice of any kind. Thanks in advance.

Regards,
Victor
