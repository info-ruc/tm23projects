Hello All:

Reading "Mobile Robots" by Jones & Flynn has gotten me interested in
implementing subsumption architecture (also known as behavior control)
on my HandyBoard.  I've found one site that has related material:
   http://krusty.eecs.umich.edu/cogarch0/subsump/index.html

1.  How many of your are (or have) playing with this programming
method on your HandyBoard.  Please share your experiences, good and
bad.

2.  Are you willing to share code?

3.  Do you have an pertinent links to share?

At this point I've only begun to write any code, so I've none to
share ... and have only found the one link posted above.

Thanks,
 - Nick -
