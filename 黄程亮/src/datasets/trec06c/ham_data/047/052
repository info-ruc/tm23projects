Bob,

I do experience the same thing and taking the average does not work
correctly.  I compare the "distance" between the values (I have it get
three) and throw out the one that is farthest away.  Then I take the
average of the remaining two.

After observing the monitor to see what the three values would end up to be
I found that this (without taking additional values) is the most accurate
method.  But I have not found a way to "eliminate" that low value which was
low enough to cause major problems for me.  Does anyone else have an idea
on how to solve this?

Scott
