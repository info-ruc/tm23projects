Our first challenge was to get our robot to move ahead straight.  There
seemed to be a difference in the motor torques.  We used shaft encoders and
compared the counts every 200 to 500 milliseconds.  Slowing down the motor
that had a higher count, for  50 to 100 milliseconds.  You have to use trial
and error with this approach as there is an optimum time for looking and an
optimum time for slowing the motors.
