Sorry, I do other things with my controllers than control robots (shame
on me!).  From other discussions I've seen though, I would think that
you could use some feedback from the turning shafts, like optical turns
counters or some such.  I wouldn't imagine that trying to use IR sensors
for distance would work very well.  If you were moving quite slowly, then
maybe...

Another thing that might make this easier is to use the smooth-PWM
routines, which give you much finer control over the speed of each motor
than the standard Interactive-C routines.  You'll still need to close
the control loop though.
