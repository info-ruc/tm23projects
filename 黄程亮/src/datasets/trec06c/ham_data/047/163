 =20
Published: 1999 July 3 =20
                                                                   9:53
am ET (1353 UT)
      Earth-sized planets ejected early in the
      history of solar systems could support life
      even in the cold depths of interstellar
      space, a Caltech scientist has found.

        In a paper published in the July 1 issue of the journal
      Nature, David Stevenson of Caltech found that such
      "interstellar planets" could retain enough heat to support
      conditions conducive to the formation of life.

        Simulations of the formation of the solar system show that
      up to ten planets the size of the Earth could have formed, but
      either collided with Jupiter or were ejected from the solar
      system during close approaches to the giant planet.

        These planets would normally cool as they moved far
      away from the Sun or any other star, but a dense hydrogen
      atmosphere retained from their formation could act as an
      insulating blanket, retaining the heat generated by the
      radioactive decay of elements in the interior of the planet.

        This could create Earth-like temperatures on the surface of
      the planet, even in the absence of an outside heat source.
      The planet could have liquid water oceans, but would have a
      surface pressure similar to that at the bottom of the Earth's
      oceans.

        If these planets have geothermal-like heat sources, the
      energy could be enough to allow the formation of some small,
      simple life forms. How complex the life could be is an open
      question, Stevenson believes. "I don't think anyone knows
      what is required to drive biological evolution from simple to
      very complex systems."

        However, other research, including that by Caltech
      colleagues Eric Gaidos and Joseph Kirschvink, suggests that
      geothermal energy sources may not be sufficient to generate
      anything more than the simplest life forms.

        Efforts to locate these planets, which may be
      commonplace if other solar systems formed like our own,
      would require advanced detection techniques, because of
      the limited amount of light they emit. Steven suggested
      looking for occultations, when the light from a background
      star is temporarily dimmed by the passage of one of these
      planets.

        "I'm not saying that these objects have life," Stevenson
      said. "All I'm saying is that, among the places you might want
      to consider for sustainable life, you might eventually want to
      look at these objects. They could be the most common
      location for life in the universe."

            INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK =20
            The Story of a Tragedy That Was Not to Be =20
            By JIM MANN
             =20
  WASHINGTON--This column is about America's
                      walk on the moon and the untold story of one
                  of the most poignant presidential speeches in
                  American history--a speech that never had to be
                  delivered. =20
                       In two weeks, this country will celebrate the
                  30th anniversary of the day when Neil Armstrong
                  and Edwin E. "Buzz" Aldrin Jr. stepped onto the
                  surface of the moon. =20
                       Over the past three decades, many of the
                  details of that epic trip have been told over and
                  over again in books and movies. And so, naturally,
                  we now take it as a given that the trip was destined
                  to be a success--that the American astronauts,
                  after landing on the moon, would return home
                  safely. =20
                       But it didn't seem so inevitable at the time. It
                  turns out that officials at the White House and
                  NASA quietly made contingency plans for what
                  President Richard Nixon would do if Armstrong and
                  Aldrin got stuck on the moon and were doomed to
                  die there. =20
                       There was even a euphemism for how such a
                  tragedy would end. The stranded astronauts would
                  "close down communications" with Mission Control
                  in Houston and be left in silence, either to die
                  slowly or, perhaps, to commit suicide. =20
                       Nixon's speech was to end with these haunting
                  words, in effect a tribute to Armstrong and Aldrin:
                  "For every human being who looks up at the moon
                  in the nights to come will know that there is some
                  corner of another world that is forever mankind." =20
                       I came across the remarkable documentary
                  evidence of this lugubrious planning a couple of
                  years ago, while doing research in the National
                  Archives. =20
                       There, sitting in the files from the Nixon
                  administration, was a memo titled: "In Event of
                  Moon Disaster." It laid out a precise scenario for
                  what Nixon should do if the astronauts' lunar
                  vehicle couldn't get back up off the moon into lunar
                  orbit to hook up with the command module. =20
                       According to the memo, once it was clear that
                  Armstrong and Aldrin could not come home, Nixon
                  was to call the "widows-to-be" to express
                  condolences. He was then to deliver a speech to
                  the nation. =20
                       Finally, at the point when NASA would cut off
                  radio communications with the moon and leave the
                  astronauts alone to die, a clergyman was to
                  commend their souls to "the deepest of the deep,"
                  in the fashion of a burial at sea. =20
                       The planning memo was drafted for Nixon's
                  chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, by Nixon's speech
                  writer, William Safire, now a columnist for the New
                  York Times. At the same time, Safire drafted the
                  short speech Nixon was to give. =20
                       Years ago, in a memoir about his time in the
                  Nixon White House, Safire briefly alluded to this
                  secret planning. =20
                       "On June 13, Frank Borman--an astronaut the
                  president liked and whom NASA had assigned to
                  be our liaison--called me to say, 'You want to be
                  thinking of some alternative posture for the
                  president in the event of mishaps on Apollo XI.'
                  When I didn't react promptly, Borman moved off the
                  formal language--'like what to do for the widows.' " =20
                       Safire complied. His memo and the speech he
                  drafted for Nixon were retained in Nixon's White
                  House files and now sit in the National Archives.
                  Here is the full text of this extraordinary speech: =20
                       Fate has ordained that the men who went to the
                  moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to
                  rest in peace. =20
                       These brave men, Neil Armstrong and Edwin
                  Aldrin, know that there is no hope for their
                  recovery. But they also know that there is hope for
                  mankind in their sacrifice. =20
                       These two men are laying down their lives in
                  mankind's most noble goal: the search for truth and
                  understanding. =20
                       They will be mourned by their families and
                  friends; they will be mourned by their nation; they
                  will be mourned by the people of the world; they
                  will be mourned by a Mother Earth that dared send
                  two of her sons into the unknown. =20
                       In their exploration, they stirred the people of
                  the world to feel as one; in their sacrifice, they
bind
                  more tightly the brotherhood of man. =20
                       In ancient days, men looked at stars and saw
                  their heroes in the constellations. In modern times,
                  we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men
                  of flesh and blood. =20
                       Others will follow, and surely find their way

I can't help wondering: what kind of life would develop or evolve in
near-total darkness? I guess we can find examples in our own ocean
depths, but what would it look like on land? Photosynthesis being out of
the question, the flora would certainly take a much different turn from
what we're familiar with, and by necessity, the fauna would also.
Interesting . . .

I was wondering about that.  They've found that the temp of planets like 
Earth and Venus are much moredetermined by the temperature of its core, and 
the nature of its crust.  So the surface temp could be similar.  Life forms 
could be based of cemosynthasis like the stuff living near ocean bottom 
volcanic vents.  Is anything down there a oxegen producer?  Sounds like a lot 
of the evolution could be similar.  Fish, legged animals, etc.

Photosynthesis is the only known oxygen producing reaction
in life that I know about. Thermal reactions don't supply a lot
of surplus energy however. That is the key factor.

Catching pellats this way could help a lot, but since they'ld being coming 
straigh at you at 3/4ths of light speed that would be nearly impossible.

A slow ship takes too long to be practical, it would need to be far larger 
and heavier.

Thanks for the suggests though.  Not quiet right yet, but new ideas are 
always worth considering.

So why  split the ship?
Just send a nice slow unmanned ship to do the pellet throwing.

I can't help wondering: what kind of life would develop or evolve in
near-total darkness? I guess we can find examples in our own ocean
depths, but what would it look like on land? Photosynthesis being out of
the question, the flora would certainly take a much different turn from
what we're familiar with, and by necessity, the fauna would also.
Interesting . . .
