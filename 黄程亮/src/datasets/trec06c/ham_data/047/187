Subject: Cannot Find pcoder22.s19
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Hi Folks,

I just purchased a Handy Board and am trying to get started with it. When I
try to download the p-code, I get the message that the download was
successful, but also the message "cannot find pcoder22.s19 or
/ic/libs/pcoder22.s19". I've looked for this file, and I don't find it in
the zip file that I downloaded for MS-DOS or in any of the libraries on the
HB website. Your help would be appreciated!

Thank you.

Buff Furman
