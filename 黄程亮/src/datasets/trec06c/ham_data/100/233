Dear BCMU 301 Students (soon to be survivors):

You may be curious what the heck "C3PO" stands for and why this is a "C3PO 
Moment" (and not a "Tid Bit Moment"). Well, I am your "New Hope."

As we all "battle" for points at the end of the quarter, I offer you (my 
treat, really) a C3PO. What is a C3PO? C3PO stands for

C ategory
3 (III/Three)
P articipation
O pportunity	Also known as BONUS MOMENT

Let's cut to the chase. I am not a big Star Wars buff, and I am sure you 
do not want to hear one of my story moments (good thing I don't have any 
to share). I am simply unsatisfied with student email CTR's. For those of 
you who asked, I have short weekends and enjoy the sunshine and warm 
weather. :)

So what must you do to earn automatic 10/10 points towards Category III 
Participation? You will need to do the following (for all or nothing 
points):

* Email me at jwoon@u.washington.edu (DO NOT reply to the class list or 
all points will be forfeited)
* Create a dynamic subject line that answers the "What is this?" question 
(make sure I know this is a C3PO fulfillment)
* Use your CTR and audience analysis skills (and other Top of the Stack 
Skills) to write at the 4/5 and 5/5 level-*IMPORTANT*
* Request that I award you 10/10 Category III Participation Points
* Indicate whether Mary can use your CTR example on the web, in
class, or in forthcoming texts
* Submit your C3PO moment no later than Monday, March 14 at Noon (1 hour 
grace period allowed)
* Include any other positive comments about the course, assignments, 
grading, TA staff, etc. (Consider your tone and the hidden audience.)

This C3PO gives you one last chance to enhance your CTR skills. You will 
need to research and connect to yours truly (ME!) in your email. To learn 
more about me, use the following sources:

-Internet
-thefacebook.com
-UW website(s)
-My Personal Website
-Email Conversations
-Mary

[Note: I expect you to find out more about me than my major - which can be 
found in my electronic signature]

Please email me at jwoon@u.washington.edu with any questions about this 
C3PO. I am happy to clarify.

Thank you for your hard work during the quarter and patience with grading.

Warm Regards,

Jason

PS May the Force be with you when writing your Self-Assessment Memo

PSS Look for an electronic receipt if you successfully "lock on" and 
complete this task
