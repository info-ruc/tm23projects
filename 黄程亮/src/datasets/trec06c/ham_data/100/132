Hello there -
 
My name is Trudi Mackenzie - I work at a laboratory at the University of Melbourne and we are looking to use DMDX to present some video stimui (footage of heroin use) to our participants (long term heroin addicts).  I am just wondering what video file types DMDX will recognise: avi, mpeg, mov files?  I have scoured the website to try to find out but don't seem able to find the answer. I would be enormously appreciative if somebody could get back to me on this one!
 
Many thanks,

Trudi
