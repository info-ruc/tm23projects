An excellent question. I was assuming that there was no strong demand 
for reliability as people have become accustomed to software being 
unreliable (at a basic level: random crashes, poor user interface, 
incompatibilities, etc.). Just asking the questions displays a more 
pro-active stance; answers could guide future proselytization.
