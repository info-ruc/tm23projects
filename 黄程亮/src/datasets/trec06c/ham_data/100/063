Let me re-phrase my question.  I would like to know if there exists an
interval solver that includes finding complex roots.  It would be
sufficient if the solver solved only systems of polynomial equations,
but they have to be of arbitrary degree.

The application, surprisingly enough, is a branch of quantum mechanics
called Yang-Mills Theory, which is a branch of what's called "string
theory", related to QCD.  I just saw a talk by a physicist yesterday.

She has a problem that reduces to needing to know the number of roots
of a system of polynomial equations.  She doesn't even need to know the
actual value of the roots, just how many there are.  Furthermore, even
a lower bound on how many roots there are would be a good start; we
don't absolutely need to resolve close roots, for example, although
of course it would be nice.  The equations are of the form

	\lambda_i = C_i \sum_{k=0}^d a_k (x_i)^k, i=1,...,n
	0 = \sum_{i=1}^n C_i l_i (x_i)^k        , k=0,...,d

and we want to solve for the x_i's.  She's tried Mathematica
and I think Maple, and I told her that I knew in principle
that an interval solver (similar to GrafEq) should be able to
solve this rigorously -- but of course it may turn out to
scale exponentially in d or n.  However, we cannot ignore
complex roots, as they are crucial in computing quantum
mechanical wave functions.

I would guess that it would, in principle, not be a major
step to take some existing solver and extend it to include
complex roots.  The question is whether it's practical.
