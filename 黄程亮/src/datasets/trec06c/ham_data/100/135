Many thanks to all those who responded to my question on INTLAB features:
to Prof. Sigfried Rump, Mr. I.A. Ashokaraj and Dr. Takeshi Ogita. You really
helped me with your advices.


The only remaining question (maybe, suggestion) is:
                                                     why isn't that thoroughly documented?
