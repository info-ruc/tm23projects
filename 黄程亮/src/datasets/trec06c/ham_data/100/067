Colleagues,





I have a question on how INTLAB and numerous INTLAB codes operate interval matrices.




Running a simple INTLAB function

 ==========================================

function y = a_bug

a = [  infsup(0,1)   infsup(2,3) ];

b = [ infsup(-2,0.5) infsup(1,3) ];


    y = a*b';


    %y = 0;

    %for k = 1 : 2;

    %    y = y + a(k)*b(k);

    %end


===========================================


that computes a "scalar product" of two interval 2-vectors,

I get the answer


      >> infsup(a_bug)

      intval  =

      [  -1.00000000000000,  10.25000000000000]




However, rewriting the above in mathematically equivalent algorithm

that uses "for" cycle


==============================================


function y = a_bug


a = [  infsup(0,1)   infsup(2,3) ];

b = [ infsup(-2,0.5) infsup(1,3) ];


    %y = a*b';


    y = 0;

    for k = 1 : 2;

        y = y + a(k)*b(k);

    end


==============================================



produces


           >> infsup(a_bug)

            intval  =

            [   0.00000000000000,   9.50000000000000]






What is the reason of such a discrepancy?

It seems to be well known: INTLAB uses a special "fast" midpoint-radius algorithm

for interval matrix multiplication called in compact MATLAB form, and this algorithm

is not "sharp".



Well, then I do not understand why G. Hargreaves in his M.S. thesis "Interval analysis in MATLAB"

as well as many others use such a compact form of the interval matrix product in their INTLAB codes,

thus getting a substantial overestimation of their results?



This is the case, in particular, for interval Gauss method and Krawczyk method

whose codes are written out by Hargreaves in his thesis.
