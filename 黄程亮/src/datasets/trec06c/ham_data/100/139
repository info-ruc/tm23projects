howdy folks,
planning has started for cryofac 2005.  if you're on the list and don't
want to be anymore, let me know.  if you'd like to help out and want to
find out how, let me know.  if you don't know what cryofac is, read on
and find out.

cryofac is a liquid-nitrogen ice cream making extravaganza that has
happened twice now at the cpw welcome party.  it's existed for years
before as an ec fac but has become better, stronger, and faster.
there's ice carving, ln2, and prefrosh, what more do you need?  it's
currently scheduled for thursday, april 7, the first day of cpw.
feel free to pass this along to folks who you think might want to help
out.

rob
