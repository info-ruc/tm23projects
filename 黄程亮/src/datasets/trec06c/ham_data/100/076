Dear colleagues,

We have been having some problems with the "reliable_computing"
list server.  In particular, sometimes but not always, items posted 
to the list were received by some, but not all, members of the list.
In response, we have just replaced our "bulk mailer" with "sendmail" 
in the process of sending the messages out.

I have "approved" five messages (from addresses the list server did
not recognize as being members) twice: once about 6 hours ago and
once less than an hour ago (from the time on this message).  I
did not receive them the first time, but I received them the most
recent time.  Hopefully, the problem is now fixed, but time will tell.

Best regards,

Baker
