Hi guys,

Here's an interesting example of an "work-product" of our Silicon
Valley counterpart.
These guys, core members of the Romanian Business Association/ Casa
Romana in N. California, sponsored and directed a short movie on
Johnny Raducanu & Romanian jazz. The movie, winner of several prizes
both in the US and Romania, was recently selected from 3000 others,
among the 100 finalists in the Cinequest Film Festival.

So, have some fun while helping these guys. You can watch the movie
online (it's only 18 minutes), vote and thus you help deciding the
winner.  If you seen it already, and would like just to vote, the
entire process would take 1 minute of your time. The web is
http://www.cinequestonline.org/2005/theater/detail_view.php?m=507.
Only be aware that the entire voting thing ends tomorrow……

vizionare placuta!
Laura
