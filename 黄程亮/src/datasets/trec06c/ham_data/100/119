Calling all CULTURAL/PERFORMANCE clubs!!! (Please Read to END)

On Saturday April 23rd 2005 during Barnard’s Prospective Student’s
of Color weekend the Multicultural International Students'
Association (MISA) and the McIntosh Activities Council (McAC) along
with the Admissions Office of Barnard College will hold its annual
One World Show!!

In the past it has primarily been a successful fashion/culture show
however this year we would like to make it BIGGER and BETTER! We
would like to remove fashion as the main focus and make it a
cultural mix of performing arts whether that be dancing, singing,
spoken word, comedy, skits..the list goes on! For one night we
would like to see as many cultural groups as possible come together
and just have fun; while showing off your cultures to the whole
university as well as prospective student's of color (also
prospective members of your clubs!:)) So, what I am trying to say
is that this will be BIG, and it will take place in the Barnard
Quad, an intimate unique setting. Following the show, we are
looking to have cultural appetizer-like food served, and then
possibly an after party!;)

So, if this seems of interest to you, please RSVP by replying to
this email. In the email please include the way in which you would
like to be involved either:
1) Perform in the show
2) Provide cultural food
3) Monetary Support if possible
4) Publicity Support if possible
5) ANY combination of the above

One last and VERY IMPORTANT thing, in order to put a face to this
e-mail and for us to get a better sense of what you would like to
perform at the show, we will be holding a meeting on Wednesday
March 2nd 2005 form 7:30-9:30pm in Lerner, we will email you on
Monday with the exact location. Please prepare a 1-2 minute
presentation of what you envision your group will do for the show.
If you CANNOT make the meeting AT ALL during those two hours please
let us know and we will arrange a separate meeting time.

Looking forward to meeting all of you!

Get Excited!!

Sincerely,

The One World Committee
