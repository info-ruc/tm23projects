It seems to me that most people who get undergraduate CS degrees do so as 
the first step towards a career as programmers.  It seems to me that most 
employers who hire graduating CS majors are hiring entry-level programmers.

While you are right that at advanced graduate and doctoral levels there are 
non-programming flavors of Computer Science, it seems to me that this 
"icing on the cake" occurs later in the curriculum, after a solid grounding 
in programming.  Computer Science, after all, is important because 
computers have become quite important in our society.  And computers are 
important because they actually run code and do things.

The point I was trying to make was that learning to do "media manipulation" 
doesn't get you very far up the difficult learning curve of computer 
programming.
