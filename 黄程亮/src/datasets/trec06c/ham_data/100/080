There have been a lot of comments about the original post about women on
the list.  However, they have all swerved away from the original, my own
included.

Basically, we are dumbing down ALL curricula to fit a less qualified
student.  Almost, a brief quantifier, ALL of our schools in the USA,
Higher Ed included, have down graded the rigor of their programs in favor
of having more students (hence more money).  Instead of having many
qualified push broom operators, and a few qualified engineers, the USA has
an overabundance of overqualified Latte Makers.  Before the Professors out
there get angry at some small town math teacher, think this over...

A very good friend teaches at Carnegie Mellon U., one of the most
prestigious CS schools around.  He teaches Grad level security courses. 
He had a Student.  The student did NOTHING, I saw the papers, and lack
thereof.  Since Daddy donated heavily, my friend was TOLD to pass the
Student.  He refused, thank God for tenure, and the Dept. passed the
student.  Has this scenario happened elsewhere?

Also, think about NCLB.  We don't teach math at my school, we teach how to
pass the PSSA (PA's Standard test).  Before you yell at the district and
my colleagues, think about what is happening at your local schools and the
above example.  For any school to survive it needs money.  Public schools
now rely on test scores, so we strive to get good test scores (it ain't
right, but ya gotta do what'cha gotta do).  Universities rely on grants,
so they try to make the givers happy.  Our goal used to be providing
trained people for the work force.  Now it's to stay in business.  What
happened?
