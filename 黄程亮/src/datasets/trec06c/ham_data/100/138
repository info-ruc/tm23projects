All I meant was that a bachelor's degree in Computer Science is now the 
minimum acceptable academic qualification for getting hired in a serious 
programming or software engineering job.  So if you want that first 
programming job after graduating from college, you're going to need that 
Computer Science degree.

I meant no insult by using the term "entry-level".  Even a brilliant career 
has to start with that first (entry-level) job.
