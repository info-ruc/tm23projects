Our solver can compute validated over- and underapproximations of the
projection to 2-dimensional space of higher-dimensional solution sets of
systems of inequalities: http://www.mpi-sb.mpg.de/~ratschan/rsolver/

Try to enter things like 
  EXISTS [z] [[-2,2]] [ x^2+y^2+z^2<=1 /\ z>y ];
in the provided web interface.

However, please be aware that all of this is still a research prototype.
