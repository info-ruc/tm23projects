I'm trying to write up papers on some of the graphing programs I've 
been working on. I've made good progress towards that end with clg
(in that I've submitted a first paper on it to a conference in the U.S.), 
which is another two-dimensional program (which was used to produce 
some of the illustrations in Hansen and Walster's "Global 
Optimization Using Interval Analysis"; I'm giving an introductory 
talk that discusses some aspects of clg here in Antwerp next week 
[Annie Cuyt has kindly brought me over here for a few weeks] and back 
at Toronto in a few weeks). After I've done a bit more writing on 
clg, I'm hoping to bring one of my older programs that displays
three-dimensional views out of hibernation.
