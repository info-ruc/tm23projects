CPW Meeting
Wednesday, 6:30pm
4-237


To those who participated in last year's CPW festival (please forward 
this message if you are no longer your group's contact):

Thanks for helping with the inaugural CPW Festival, one of the most 
successful CPW events ever.  Now, we begin preparations for CPW 2005.

On Wednesday at 6:30pm in 4-237, we'll begin talking about this 
year's CPW, with a special focus on the CPW Festival.  We'll also 
provide an overview of the CPW schedule and talk about this year's 
other events.

Please let me know if no one from your group can make it.  Please 
feel free to invite folks from other groups who may be interested.

Many thanks,
-- Matt
