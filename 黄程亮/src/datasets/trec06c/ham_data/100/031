I was looking at the error rate on individual items in an ism file and
can't understand some of the error rates. Here are the examples.  
 1164   9.1 -73 <% 30> "*"/ * "slight  fork";
 1209  13.6 -74 <% 30> "*"/ * "breath  attack";
 1149   0.0 -75 <% 30> "*"/ * "lose  stimulus";
 1026   4.5 -76 <% 30> "*"/ * "prove  cabin";
 1200   5.3 -77 <% 30> "*"/ * "stay  sign";
 1141   5.0 -78 <% 30> "*"/ * "spin  wire";
I had 22 participants. The first error rate is easy to understand. 2 out
of 22 was 9.1%. 13.6% is 3, and 4.5% is 1. But what about 5.3%, 5.0%.
How can I get an error rate like this if it is the number of
participants with incorrect responses divided by the total number of
participants? Do I miss something here?

An unrelated question: is there any way to exclude a perticular
participant in analysis other than manually removing this person's data
in the azk file? I understand I can automantically exclude participants
with high error rates by specifying an error rate in the spc file, but
how about a participant with low ER? I need to do so because the
participants completed two tasks and some made high error rates in one
task and I want to exclude them from both tasks. 

Best,

Nan Jiang
