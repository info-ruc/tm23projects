Yes, this is true and is easy to do, assuming we have a solver than can
solve a 2n by 2n system.  Does such a solver currently exist?  I know
it can be done and I know how to do it, but it would be alot of work
to actually code it up.  Certainly this must have been done already?

GrafEq would be perfect except it only works in two variables, whereas
I need to solve systems of polynomial equations with an arbitrary
number of equations and variables.

UniCalc appears to have the language to define the problem nicely, but
is not rigorous and returns answers which are only approximate, and
will often claim to find multiple nearby roots where in fact only one
actually exists.

INTLAB looks like it might be up to the task, but I am not very
famaliar to MATLAB and am reluctant to expend the effort to learn it
unless I know there's a decent chance I can get it to work.

GlobSol also looks promising.

There are plenty of packages listed at 

	http://www.cs.utep.edu/interval-comp/intsoft.html

but I just want some hints as to were to start!  :-)
