  See Ken's page:

     The DMASTR software is distributed free of charge, and we ask only 
that you acknowledge use of the system in publications (e.g., "The 
experiment was run using the DMASTR software developed at Monash University 
and at the University of Arizona by K.I.Forster and J.C.Forster.").
