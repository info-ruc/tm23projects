   I guess you could try using the abort item key.  You'd want to set it to 
the release of a key, say -A, so that as the tone is playing them releasing 
the key would abort that item and stop the sound from playing.  You'd want 
to have two item pairs, first item would present the tone that the duration 
has to be matched and wait for a request.  You'd want to map the request to 
+A, have as low a delay parameter as you can (will depend on the machine 
but if you use the media life keyword on your sounds you should be able to 
get it down to one or two ticks) and the second item will start playing a 
really long tone and be aborted when they release the A key.  You can map 
-A as a response key as well, looks like the code will allow such activity 
so you'll get the RT in the AZK file.
