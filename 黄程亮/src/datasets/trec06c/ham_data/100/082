It is simply not true that most employers that hire CS grads from four 
year colleges are hiring them to be entry level programmers. They are 
hired for many type of jobs, some outside computer science. Most in 
computer science include more on the job training. But to characterize 
them as mostly entyr level programers is simply not true. The breadth of 
understanding that they get studying computer science as opposed to 
computer programming is important.
