Subject: Workshop in Nice on Automatic Differentiation

First European Workshop on Automatic Differentiation

http://www-sop.inria.fr/tropics/adNice2005/

April 14-15, 2005

Maison du Seminaire,
29, boulevard Franck Pilatte,
Nice, France

This 2-day workshop replaces the UK Automatic Differentiation
Workshops, which took place twice a year at Cranfield University
(Shrivenham) and the University of Hertfordshire. These workshops
provide a forum for the presentation of theoretical developments in
and applications of Automatic Differentiation (AD) and adjoint
methods. The workshop is informal and presentations on subjects such
as work in progress, problem areas for AD, or possible application
areas, as well as completed work are welcome. We particularly
encourage PhD students and those new to the field to attend and
present their work. This workshop will put some emphasis on
development of AD tools and perhaps other topics to be announced
later.

Confirmed speakers include:
  Shaun Forth - "Developments in the MAD package"
  Andreas Griewank - Title to be confirmed
  Mohamed Tadjoudine - "Differentiating a time-dependent CFD solver"
  Jean Utke - "Automatic checkpoints and adaptive reversal schemes"
