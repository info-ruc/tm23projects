Dear everyone,

48 Hours tomorrow night (Saturday, February 26th) will broadcast a
one-hour show about sex trade in Eastern Europe/Romania. I have
worked on it as researcher, translator, fixer, and occasionally, as
production assistant. It will air at 10 p.m. ET -- unless bad news
comes out of the Vatican, in which case you will see a 'Dan Rather
special' instead.

I know it's short notice, but I hope you'll have a chance to watch.

Sinziana
