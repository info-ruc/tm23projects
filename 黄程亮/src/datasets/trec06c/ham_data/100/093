Wayne,

For semialgebraic problems (those given by a collection of polynomials
and quantifiers) you can also try algebraic methods (based on, e.g.,
cylindrical algebraic decomposition [CAD]); example programs include
qepcad and qepcad b. One of the strengths of interval methods is that
they can be applied to non-semialgebraic problems.
