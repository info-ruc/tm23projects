   <ms%> is provided for people that don't care about accurate timing, DMDX 
calculates how many retrace intervals are guaranteed to be longer than the 
parameter to <ms%>.  Use whole retrace intervals with <fd> 
instead.  Millisecond timing in DMDX is generally not possible (there are 
exceptions, <RevertOutput> is one of them, <Timeout> is another), most 
things are specified in retrace intervals.

   <d 0> is also not guaranteed, it's simply a command to move to the next 
item as quickly as possible.  I recommend <d 2> for fast machines and <d 
10> for older machines.  Note, it's in retrace intervals, not milliseconds.

   Your value of the retrace interval of the video mode you are using may 
not not accurate and there may be timing errors that are forcing to DMDX to 
do it's best to get things right.  You need to read the advanced timing 
documentation in TimeDX and see that you've got good values for the retrace 
interval.  Often I find setting the Read Between Flips to Stop Cheating 
Drivers in TimeDX's Refresh Rate test clears a lot of these problems up.

   Beyond that you need to make sure there are no worms or viruses or 
spyware on the machine as they bork things right up.

   The triggers will be appearing with the words, the timing of the words 
however is another matter.

   Would that DMDX was simple, but then you wouldn't be able to do a fifth 
of the things that are possible with it.
