There should be one kept attached to the small putz dewar.

Otherwise, you can buy them from McMaster-Carr (or to get extra ripped-off,
VWR Scientific) for $50 to $100.  I can help you find the right part number
if you need it -- but if my memory serves me right it's 316 stainless with
1/2" female SAE flare fittings.
