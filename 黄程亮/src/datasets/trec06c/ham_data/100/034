I have had a number of CS majors (and CS professors) who were able to 
program (and program well), but whose first love in CS was not programming.  
Being able to handle the picky details and loving to deal with picky 
details is not the same thing.  For instance, some people really enjoy
learning every obscure language feature (or editor or word processor or
spreadsheet feature) and using it.  I personally prefer the approach that 
Wirth espoused in his Turing Award lecture, where he talked about language
design as a process of eliminating features until one has a minimal 
design that allows the programmer to build whatever else is needed.

Actually, there are two groups of Ph.D.s in computer science, theoreticians
and systems researchers.  (A similar division occurs in physics between
the theoreticians and the experimentalists.)  The theoreticians tend to
be more mathematical and spend their time inventing, analyzing, and proving
things about algorithms or computing.  Many can program well, but some
who moved over from logic or probability or number theory other areas of 
pure math have done very little programming.  The systems researchers design
and implement systems, and are often quite mathematical themselves.  It is 
NOT obvious which of these groups has higher status.  Both respect what 
the other group does, and both are well represented among the Turing Award 
winners (the nearest thing to a Nobel Prize in CS).  In fact Turing (after 
whom the award was named) is primarily known as a theoretician.

In fact, many of my majors who do not go to graduate school do not end up
as programmers.  They are consultants or managers or use their CS knowledge
in business or on Wall Street.

This ignores a third group - automotive engineers, the people who design the
cars.  They may be good mechanics, also, but that is not a requirement for
the job.  And it certainly is not sufficient.
