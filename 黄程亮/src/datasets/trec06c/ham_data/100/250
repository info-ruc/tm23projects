Hi All,

May I ask you a question? I am going to carry out a handgrip study which
I would like to use DMDX to present the stimuli to the participants and
to use powerlab to record the strength of the handgrip applied by the
participants. My question is: is there any method that I can display
both the stimuli (from dmdx) and the readings from powerlab (a small
window showing the strength of handgrip) to the participant via the same
monitor? so that the participants are informed when to squeeze the
handgrip and how hard they squeezed it.

many thanks,
savio
