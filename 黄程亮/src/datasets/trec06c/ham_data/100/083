To all bantering back and forth about Computer Science:

It is ABOUT TIME!!!

I am a member of the AP Physics List Serve also and the topics and
arguments there are far more frequent and verbose.  It is great fun to read
something other than CS detail problems, lab construction, and Java
problems.

Now, about computer science (lower case on purpose).

Is it really even a science??

My gosh, the Natural Philosophers (physicists) took over 50 years just to
build a definition of energy.  "Computer Science" has barely been around 50
years.  In fact, computer science as a departmental subject at most
colleges probably dates from the 60's (I guess so don't chew me up if I
miss it by a decade or so).

Barb pushes for including every allied computer field under the umbrella of
computer science.  Can one imagine a physics department granting advanced
degrees "Physics Administration" or virtually anything other than "Hard
Core" physics research (or theoretical research - mostly using our beloved
computers, these days).  I am real uncomfortable trying to be all things to
all people and still calling it "Science".  Nothing wrong with what Barb is
trying to do, we sure do need these folks, but in my book it isn't computer
science.

My really BIG problem is that I don't really have a clue what Computer
Science is!!

The real problem is the computer science isn't really like the other
sciences where we are trying to understand the "real world".  CS folks are
sort of like mathematicians (sorry math haters) and musicians in that they
are actually getting to invent there world out of essentially thin air.

Y'all have phun chewing on me.  This is sure more fun than discussing Java
arcanity (is this a word?)
