That word "all" may not be as accurate as one thinks.  I work at a
private school and am permitted to teach what I believe we should be
teaching regarding computer technology.

I currently have a dual-enrollment, partnership program with a local
community college where I teach 1 of their classes - CIS 105 - but I
teach it on my high school campus for my juniors and seniors only.  Upon
payment of the college tuition and successful completion of this course
they receive 3 college credits.  It's a one semester class at the
college and it's a one semester class at my high school.

I'm currently pursuing a similar dual-enrollment program regarding JAVA.
And I'm pursuing this relationship at a state university rather than the
junior college.  It too would be a one semester class at both locations.

The "Subject" line asks why aren't more attracted to computer science,
well perhaps it's the pedagogy implemented that drives many off.  Let's
offer classes that are directly applicable to the colleges and
universities if not the exact classes as I've described.  Let's offer
those classes in a time frame that is also directly correlated to
colleges and universities - 1 semester.  Let's offer classes that entice
many to computer science and not just programming.  I suggest the
following to do just that - entice students to pursue computer science.

I downloaded the following Computer Science program of study from a
state university - it includes many topics.
http://www.eas.asu.edu/%7Ecsedept/courses/index.php#cse100

I broke down the preceding program into 4 core topics that I'm
researching in order to develop my future Honors CS class:
1. Programming
	- HTML
	- VB
	- Java
2. Internet	
	- Macromedia Studio MX
		- Digital photography, video, webcam
		- Animation
		- Website, Intranet development
3. CAD
	- Bentley PowerDraft
		- 2D & 3D designs
		- Residential architecture
4. OS & NOS
	- 2000, 2003, XP - Server, Desktop
		- A+, Network architecture, client-server, security,
wireless

This, in my opinion, would be a program of study that entices students
to pursue Computer Science.  

My goal is to offer high school students a choice from a wide array of
technical topics in the attempt to challenge some to pursue technology
as one of the most fun and satisfying life choices one could make for a
profession.

I'm currently taking the necessary steps so that "soon" I'll be
offering:
1. Introduction to CIS - foundational class
2. Introduction to CS - prerequisite is #1

All following must have #1 & #2 as the prerequisite.

3. AP CS A & AB - hopefully 1 semester each
4. Honors CS - as described immediately above - 5.0 high school course
work
5. College Java - CSE 110 - for college credit
6. College CIS - CIS 105 - for college credit
7. Advanced Technical Support

... I am currently switching schools to find one who will let me truly
teach Math.  We are all disservicing the students but it is coming down
from on high.  What can we do?

 Basically, we are dumbing down ALL curricula to fit a less qualified
student.  Almost, a brief quantifier, ALL of our schools in the USA,
Higher Ed included, have down graded the rigor of their programs in
favor of having more students (hence more money). 
 
Our goal used to be providing trained people for the work force.  Now
it's to stay in business.  What happened?
