There's a new version of Analyze, 2.06, in the DMDXUTILS zip file:

When the .spc file specifies both an SD cutoff and an absolute cutoff, it 
makes a difference which is applied first. Version 2.04 of ANALYZE 
calculated and applied the SD cutoffs first and then applied the absolute 
cutoffs. This has the disadvantage that extreme outliers will affect the SD 
cutoffs. It makes more sense to first rule out extreme outliers using 
absolute cutoffs, and then calculate and apply the SD cutoffs. This is the 
procedure followed in version 2.06 of ANALYZE.
