   That's the item file before the scramble, it's not what DMDX is having 
trouble reading.  Look at the file scrambled.itm (probably in c:\program 
files\dmdx), it contains the results of the scramble.  Your problem 
probably stems from the fact that you've got the wrong things locked down 
between pairs of $ signs, usually one would be locking the end of the 
experiment, not the contents:


=57 * " That"c;
-57 * "myth folks"c;
-57 * " still chains"c;
+57 * " air exists"c;
-57 * " in aunt"c;
+57 * " paper the"c;
+57 * " mother southern"c;
+57 *" watch. States."c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
$
0! "End.";

   I include dummy items in those instances:


=57 * " That"c <biw 999>;
-57 * "myth folks"c <biw 999>;
-57 * " still chains"c <biw 999>;
+57 * " air exists"c <biw 999>;
-57 * " in aunt"c <biw 999>;
+57 * " paper the"c <biw 999>;

+57 *" watch. States."c <biw 999>;
