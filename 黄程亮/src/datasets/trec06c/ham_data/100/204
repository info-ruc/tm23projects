WASHINGTON =96 Microsoft founder Bill Gates called American high schools=20=

=93obsolete=94 Saturday as he addressed the nation=92s governors and =
others=20
gathered for a national education summit.

  =93Our high schools, even were they to work as designed, cannot teach=20=

our students all they need to know today,=94 the self-made software=20
billionaire said.

  Gates has donated almost $1 billion to support the redesign of 1,500=20=

high schools, including McKinley High School in Canton into what he=20
believes will be more effective learning institutions. McKinley is=20
being reorganized into five smaller schools within the same facility.

  The two-day summit, which continues Sunday, has drawn more than 150=20
participants, including governors, education officials and business=20
executives. They say their purpose is to find ways to strengthen and=20
update the high school curriculum, align it with the requirements of=20
college and the workplace, and reduce the dropout rate.

  =93We need to ensure that the standards and the tests and the=20
course-taking requirements for earning a high school diploma really=20
reflect the real world demands of college and our economy,=94 said Ohio=20=

Gov. Bob Taft, a leading figure in education reform among the=20
governors.

  Taft lauded Gates=92 financial support for high school redesign, which=20=

is helping pay for the reorganization of 17 high schools in Ohio, as=20
well as three more yet to be named.

  Addressing the summit, Gates echoed the theme that students in the=20
United States are falling behind their counterparts abroad. He said=20
high schools must provide a more rigorous education to all students,=20
including the poor and minorities.

  Just one-third of high school graduates go to college, he said. =93The=20=

other two-thirds, most of them low income and minorities, are tracked=20
into courses that won=92t ever get them ready for college or prepare =
them=20
for family-wage jobs.=94

  As an alternative to the obsolescence he criticized, Gates trumpeted=20=

the virtues of smaller schools.

  He said the building blocks of high school improvement are the new=20
=93three Rs=94 =96 rigor, relevance and relationships.

  Gates said a more rigorous curriculum, relevant subject matter and a=20=

better relationship between teachers and students would improve=20
education.

  =93The three Rs are almost always easier to promote in smaller high=20
schools,=94 he said. =93The smaller size gives teachers and staff the=20
opportunity to create an environment where students achieve at a higher=20=

level and rarely fall through the cracks. Students in smaller schools=20
are more motivated, they have higher attendance rates, they feel=20
safer.=94

  Gates=92 speech drew applause from many, including Susan Tave Zelman,=20=

superintendent of public instruction in Ohio.

  =93I thought it was great,=94 she said. She also said she agrees that =
the=20
current high school model is obsolete. But Zelman added that changing=20
high school structure alone is not enough.

  =93What you have to do is improve the quality of teaching and learning=20=

in that classroom,=94 she said, after participating in a roundtable=20
discussion moderated by Taft. =93The curriculum must be challenging and=20=

rigorous.=94

  Asked how high school redesign is going in Ohio, she said, =93It=92s =
very=20
hard to take large and impersonal high schools and break them down into=20=

smaller learning communities. ... We want to work in partnership ... to=20=
