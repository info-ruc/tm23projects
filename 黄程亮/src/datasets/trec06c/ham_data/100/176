Everything Michael said is correct.  It is so
aggravating to be a Math teacher and the department
forces you to teach to the test.  It is
extraordinarily sad.  I say that I work in the
calculator department, not the Math department.  I am
currently switching schools to find one who will let
me truly teach Math.  We are all disservicing the
students but it is coming down from on high.  What can
we do?
