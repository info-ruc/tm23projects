  I volunteered back at the meeting to be in charge of
small-stuff-acquisition. I'm already on the gloves, and I'll check out
spoons as well. If you can get me the old list of equipment, I'll see
what else I can take care of. The old list of ingredients will obviously
vary a little, but it also can't really be bought ahead of time.
  Where does one GET dewar hoses? And do we have any?
