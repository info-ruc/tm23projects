Hello, 

I have an enquiry about DMDX that I hoped someone might be able to answer. 

I'm trying to design an experiment which involves participants listening to a tone, and then reproducing that tone.  Ideally I'd like the computer to emit a tone for a predetermined length of time (e.g. 4, 8, & 12 secs), and for the participant to reproduce that same tone (equal in pitch - it would just be the duration they have control of) by pressing a button on the keyboard or some other input device such as a joystick.  The tone would be produced until they release the button.  The data would then hopefully be stored in terms of millisecond/seconds.  So they would hear a tone and then try to match the duration with a tone produced by them.  Is that the sort of thing DMDX can do, and if so, how do I do it?  

Many thanks,
