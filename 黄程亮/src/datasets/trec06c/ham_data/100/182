In almost all cases, hit the delete key and don't compound the problem by forwarding it to anyone. The only exception might be if the message was delivered less than 15 minutes ago and you are sure you know how to send full headers to spamcop.net or antiphishing.org.
<p>
Most full-featured email programs (basically anything except Outlook Express) have a trainable local spam filter... though it's unlikely they'd be able to do much with novel misspellings, either.

General Spam and Scam FAQ

If you have provided personal information to a scam site, follow the steps
at http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/

If you receive junk or scam mail, hit the delete key. It is safe to assume
that automated systems have already collected a copy, so there is seldom
anything to be gained by forwarding it to anyone.

The global financial industry also collects scams, and coordinates their
efforts through http://www.antiphishing.org/

Sending a message to antiphishing.org or spamcop.net within 15 minutes of
the time the message was sent to you can sometimes be helpful. Beyond that
time, it is safe to assume that they already have several copies. Just hit
the delete key.

By default, we only reject junk that has been identified as such with 95%
confidence or more; at that level, we reject about 25% of all incoming
email. If you wish to filter your own mail at the 50% or 70% confidence
level, visit the Spam Preferences utility at
https://webmail.(staff, undergrad, grad).brandeis.edu/horde/spam/

We do not want to hear about junk mail. We know that more than half of all
mail is junk, and already do everything possible to keep the flood at bay.

We *do* need to know *immediately* at postmaster@brandeis if junk email
controls reject (not just tag) a legitimate email. We always give specific
reasons for the rejection. Include the full text in reports to postmaster.

All right, I just deleted it, and will delete any other that come my way. Thanks for the help (that was incredibly fast by the way (wow)).

Does spam@brandeis.edu do anything?  Is it not worth forwarding full emails to that address?

spam@brandeis.edu is one way to get the text above sent to you, asking you not to forward spam to anyone.

antiphishing.org, spamcop.net, etc. tend to react much faster than humans.
