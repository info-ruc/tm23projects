Hi Jo,
Right now we mostly just need to get people lined up to help out over
CPW (things like mixing stuff in a kitchen, mixing stuff in front of the
pre-frosh, serving ice cream, cleaning, setup during the day, buying
stuff right beforehand).  We're kind of in a hell of meetings at this
point, trying to get stuff organized and funded, so there's not all that
much to do until we get closer to April.  At any rate, I've added you to
the cryofac mailing list so you should see updates as they come in.

Rob
