Three cheers for people like this.

At Carnegie Mellon, I know Mark Stehlik has a volleyball net,
and is rumored to occasionally shut the CMU computer lab down and take the
students outside for an hour. If more of us did "extracurricular" activities
like this ...

Funny, but not really.  This is a lament I've heard from girls quite a
bit. And, at the high school level, many boys are still in the zit stage
- a BIG problem for boys who pick on junk food and stay planted in front
of their computers or video games. One contribution I try to make is to
encourage all my students to find some outdoor activities they can enjoy
(camping, hiking, biking, any outdoor sport, walking, skiing, etc.etc.)
and get the heck away from the computer for a while at least every week.
Field trips and excursions outside the building are also helpful
whenever opportunity arises and time permits. Also, the endless supply
of black t-shirts, sweatshirts, and pants are not all that attractive to
girls either. Discussions on these health and hygiene issues are
appreciated quietly by all... I've got 3 girls in a class of 21... and 2
in a class of 13 ... it's a start.... there were zero girls 3 years
ago.
