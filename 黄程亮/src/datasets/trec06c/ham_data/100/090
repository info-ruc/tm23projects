Hi all,
I am fairly new to the DMDX world and I am trying to
run a program with a video clip for an experiment
concerning event perception.  I need to have the
subjects making responses while the video is running. 
Is it possible to record their responses while the
clip is running?  Will the data come out in the .zil
or .azk file?
Thanks!
-Jackie
