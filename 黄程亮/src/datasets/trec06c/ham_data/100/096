            4th International Symposium on Imprecise Probabilities
                            and Their Applications
                             Final Call for Papers

                               July 20-23, 2005
                          Carnegie Mellon University

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The ISIPTA meetings are one of the primary international forums to
present and discuss new results on the theory and applications of
imprecise probabilities. Imprecise probability has a wide scope, being
a generic term for the many mathematical or statistical models which
measure chance or uncertainty without sharp numerical
probabilities. These models include belief functions, Choquet
capacities, comparative probability orderings, convex sets of
probability measures, fuzzy measures, interval-valued probabilities,
possibility measures, plausibility measures, and upper and lower
expectations or previsions. Imprecise probability models are needed in
inference problems where the relevant information is scarce, vague or
conflicting, and in decision problems where preferences may also be
incomplete.

Themes of the symposium
-----------------------

Although the symposium will be open to contributions on all
aspects of imprecise probability, three main themes will be
emphasised: decision-making, algorithms, and real applications.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

models of coherent imprecise assessments
convex sets of probability measures (credal sets)
interval-valued probabilities
upper and lower expectations or previsions
non-additive set functions, and in particular Choquet
    capacities (and Choquet integration), fuzzy measures,
    possibility measures, belief and plausibility measures
random sets
rough sets
comparative probability orderings
qualitative reasoning about uncertainty
imprecision in utilities and expected utilities
limit laws for imprecise probabilities
physical models of imprecise probability
philosophical foundations for imprecise probabilities
psychological models for imprecision and indeterminacy
    in probability assessments
elicitation techniques for imprecise probabilities
robust statistics
probabilistic bounding analysis
data mining with imprecise probabilities/missing data
estimation and learning of imprecise probability models
decision making with imprecise probabilities
ambiguity aversion and economic models of imprecise probability
uncertainty in financial markets
algorithms for manipulating imprecise probabilities
Dempster-Shafer theory
information algebras and probabilistic argumentation systems
probabilistic logic, propositional and first-order
credal networks and other graphical models
credal classification
applications in statistics, economics, finance,
         management, engineering, computer science
         and artificial intelligence, psychology,
         philosophy and related fields

Workshop on Financial Risk Assessment
-------------------------------------
There will be a workshop addendum to the conference,
to be held on July 24, with invited speakers on the topic
of financial risk assessment, to which all of the ISIPTA'05
participants are welcome, at no additional registration cost.
Details will be announced later.

Location
--------
ISIPTA '05 will be held at Carnegie Mellon University,
in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States.

Important dates
---------------
(These dates reflect the last and final deadline extension!)
Paper submission deadline: March 7 2005 (11:59PM US Eastern time)
Notification of acceptance: April 25 2005
Deadline for revised papers: May 25 2005
Symposium: July 20-23 2005

Submissions and Proceedings
---------------------------
(Note increase in paper size!!)
We will accept papers only as PDF files with a limit of 10 pages
in two-column format. Guidelines are available both in a PDF file
and in a word file at the site
    http://www.sipta.org/isipta05/submit.html.
The simplest way to produce an article that satisfies these
requirements is to use Latex with the isipta2005.sty style, using
guidelinesat the file isipta05.tex (or using this file as a
template). Otherwise, use the file isipta2005.doc as template.

Submission is electronic. You should introduce paper data and
attach the PDF file by using the submission page.

The Program Committee will decide which of the submitted papers
are accepted, by carefully evaluating their originality, significance,
technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. All the accepted
papers will be included in a volume of proceedings, published
by Brightdocs.

There will be free electronic access to the proceedings after some
time. Before the conference, the electronic access will be restricted
to the ISIPTA '05 attendees to allow them to study the papers in some
detail before they are actually presented. Each accepted paper will be
given the opportunity for both a brief oral presentation as well as
a poster session.
