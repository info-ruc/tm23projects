Attn: The President/CEO

I am Mr. Lewis Kibuuka, Provincial Director Standard Bank of South Africa,
Johannesburg Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you.

On June 6, 2002, a foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the South Africa
Mining Corporation, Mr. Richard Moss made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit
for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five
Million Dollars) in my branch.  Upon maturity, I sent a routine
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.  After a month,
we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,
the South Africa Mining Corporation that Mr.Richard Moss died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died
without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Richard
Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.  No one will
ever come forward to claim it.  According to South Africa Law, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand
in as the next of kin to Mr. Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old
man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your
full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary
documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. 
We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in
any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me
and 40% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please
reply immediately via the private email address below.  Upon your
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant
documents that will help you understand the transaction.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email
Thanks and regards.

Mr.Lewis Kibuuka
