Wayne,

We have a Maple interface to our interval analysis library ALIAS
that may allow to deal with your problem (for your information
we have already worked in the field of quantum mechanics, see
Mladen Pavicic et al 2005 J. Phys. A: Math. Gen. 38 1577-159,
issue of February 2005: this was an interesting work for us 
where we have to solve systems of between 40 and 200 equations
and a huge number of them, last total was about 400 millions!). 
Alternatively we
have close contact with people working in algebraic geometry
with Groebner basis and they may have a solution too.
So the best way is to send us a typical example and we will
see what happen. Best

Jean-Pierre
