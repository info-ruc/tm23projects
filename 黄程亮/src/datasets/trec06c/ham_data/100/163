P.S. I have a new computer with which I am still somewhat struggling, and our 
network is going to be repaired over the weekend. I apologize for possible 
further delays in answering emails. Vladik

=========================================
ECCAD, East Coast Computer Algebra Day, is an annual conference that
provides opportunities to learn and share new developments and to
present research results in the areas of symbolic and mathematical
computation. 

The 12th Annual East Coast Computer Algebra Day (ECCAD 2005) will be
held on Saturday, March 12, 2005. It will be hosted by the Department of
Mathematics and Computer Science at Ashland University in Ashland, Ohio,
USA. 

ECCAD 2005 will be in honor of Professor Bob Caviness's 65th birthday.
Bob Caviness is a Professor Emeritus (with a joint appointment in
Mathematical Sciences) and former Chair of the Department of Computer &
Information Sciences at the University of Delaware. His research
interests include the design and analysis of algebraic algorithms, in
particular, algorithmic decision procedures for integration in finite
terms and for computing closed form solutions of differential
equations.More recently he has turned to web-based technologies. He has
five Ph.D. and two M.S students. Professor Caviness has served in
various editorial capacities for the following jourmals: ACM
Transactions on Mathematical Software, ACM Computing Reviews,
CONSTRAINTS, the online e-commerce journal ACM SIGecom Exchanges, and
the Journal of Symbolic Computation. He served as Editor-in-Chief of the
latter journal for the period 1995-2000. He has also lectured widely and
served the profession in many other capacities. Happy Birthday, Bob!

TRAVEL SUPPORT:
Pending NSF support, the conference hopes to be able to provide limited
travel support for some participants to attend ECCAD'2005.  Graduate
students and junior faculty are particularly encouraged to apply.
Support may cover only partially travel expenses and lodging for up to
two nights.  There will be no stipends. Make sure the flight has a

support, please send your inquiry with an itemized estimate of your
expenses to eccad@ashland.edu. Please note that if your application is
approved and if funding is available, you will receive your
reimbursement after the conference. All applications for support are due
by March 1, 2005. Support is subject to successful funding.
