Hello,

   After finding solution to my PIO card problems I managed to configure set
for measuring ERPs. But during analysis of the first data file, I've found
DMDX is doing very strange things with timing.

I use <ms%> keyword for enforcing delay. In the following code, I've put
into square brackets real timings measured as triggers by ERP gathering
program - the time since the previous trigger.



<azk> <cr>
<vm 1024,768,16,0> 
<nfb>
<dbc 160160160> <dwc 0>
<d 0> <t 5000>
<RevertOutput 5,0> <InputDevice PIO12>

<InputDevice Keyboard> <MapRequest +Space> <MNR +Left Shift> <MPR +Right Shift>

<EndOfParameters>

0 "Press space to begin.";


-197 <ms% 1000> / <ms% 500> <o 3> "+" / <ms% 400> <o 3>[450] /
   <ms% 300> <o 1>[360] "word1" / <ms% 200> <o 3>[270]  /
   <ms% 115> <o 1>[180]"word2" / <ms% 200> / <ms% 300> <o 2>[287] "word3" /
   <ms% 200> / <ms% 300> <o 3>[450] "word4" / * "???" / !;


so the timings are very strange. this is a test procedure, in the real one I
have used the following sequence: 
.. / <ms% 200> / <ms% 300> <o 2> "word1" / <ms%200> / <ms% 300> <o 2> "word2" / ...
so the delay should be always around 500, and the triggers appeared
always in 450 ms delay, so it was not random.


It seems the words appear on the screen in the same time as the triggers
were gathered on another computer, so it can't be an I/O problem. I know it,
since ERPs for successive words look similiar, and are not phase shifted (as
it would be if the triggers were shifted in relation to words).

I fear I'm making a very simple mistake, but I can't figure it out.

can you figure anything out of it?


thanks, 
Jakub.
