Michael raises the infamous Static Electricity problem.  My simple
solutions are as follows:
1.  Don't worry about it - OK, not a great solution but it works where I
am.  Even NC get cold and dry from December to February.
2.  We have standard (25 year old tile) flooring on a concrete slab floor -
one story building.
3.  The heat in my room has been dead for three years.  However, 20-30 kids
+ 20+ computers = plenty warm and no special drying.  We leave the
computers AND monitors on ALL the time in the winter.
4.  The only real problem we have ever had occured back in the mid-80's
when we were using dumb terminals hooked to a big mini-computer (how is
that for and oxymoron!!)  We had 32 terminals hooked to one of our 3
minicomputers and a girl sat down at one of the terminals and removed a
very nice cashmere sweater.  The rest is history.  She tuched the keyboard
and took out ALL 32 terminals and the compter.  We got the computer back up
in about 2 days with a rush shipment of internals from the manufacturer but
it took almost a month to get all the terminals repaired.  One lousy
sweater!!
To this day, I tell the kids that when it is dry ground themselves if they
think they are generating static electricity.  The concrete floor of course
is a pretty good ground all by istelf.
