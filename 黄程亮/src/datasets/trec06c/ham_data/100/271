Dear Friends, 

Since one of the main sources of interval uncertainty is measurement 
uncertainty which often leads to intertval bounds, this conference may be of 
interest to some researchers from our community. 

I attended last year's conference in St. Petersburg, Russia, and learned a lot, 
especially from application-oriented talks.

P.S. Goethe and Schiller lived and worked in Weimar. UNESCO lists Weimar as one 
of its World Heritage Centers.
