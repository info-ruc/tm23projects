hallo,

when running a syntax check dmdx isn't able to read the last line of the experiment. here it is:
$
=57 * " That"c;
-57 * "myth  folks"c;
-57 * " still chains"c;
+57 * " air exists"c;
-57 * " in aunt"c;
+57 * " paper the"c;
+57 * " mother southern"c;
+57 *" watch. States."c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
$

0! "End.";

also i am not sure about how to abort an item after a wrong answer because from what i understood one should use the keyword <branch> and then tell the program with which item it shall continue but that would make a randomization hard, wouldn't it? or is that why in other maze task many sentences have the same item number?

thank you very much for your help,

tanya dolis
