Dear Wayne and others,

You can try our windows minisolver "Proj2d" available at 
http://www.istia.univ-angers.fr/~dao/Proj2DV5.zip
developed by Massa Dao, Xavier Baguenard and myself (as a supervisor).
Proj2d draws an inner and an outer approximation of the two-dimensional 
projection of a set defined by nonlinear equalities or inequalities.
Proj2D uses algorithms based on interval analysis and constraint 
propagation. 
Extract the zip file and run the program. You will understand quickly. 
You can enter equalities (such as "y=sin(x)") or inequalities (such as 
"sqr(x)+sin(y)+z in [1,2]").
Note that Proj2d is not yet finished and you may find some bugs. 
Please, if you meet any problems or if you have any suggestions, let us 
know.
I hope that it might help you to solve your problems.

Regards,

Luc

Does a more recent version of "UniCalc" exist?






Hello.  I've been playing with Jeff Tupper's wonderful GrafEq program
(http://www.peda.com/grafeq), but I would like to be able to solve
problems in more than two variables.  Some searching around finds
a program called UniCalc,

                 
http://archives.math.utk.edu/software/msdos/miscellaneous/unicalc/.html

although it's a little archaic (from about 1995, only working under
MS-DOS).  Is there anything a bit more modern that combines the
versatility of UniCalc with a more modern interface, and presumably
updated algorithms, such as those found in GrafEq?
