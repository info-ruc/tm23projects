Hello Wayne,

Here are the facts concerning Unicalc that i am aware of.
Yes, Unicalc is accessible through web-interface at 
http://speedy.iis.nsk.su.
Please keep in mind that this site is not maintained regularly.
You will find two solvers there: Unicalc3 (the one you mention) and a 
beta version of Unicalc5.
Please see Introduction for general instructions on usage.
All your runs of Unicalc will be limited to 15 variables and 5 seconds 
of CPU time.
Hopefully, Unicalc5 will be released April-May 2005.

Best regards,
Evgueni Petrov.
