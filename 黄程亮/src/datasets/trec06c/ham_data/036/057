I am using the expander board, and no, I don't have any extra caps.

It looks like a PVC coupler, maybe cut in half.  Could be an end cap,
but then there would have to be foam inside to prevent ringing. These
can be purchased at many hardware and most home care stores.

I have mine on a servo.  If you look on this page (second picture
down), you can almost tell.  Look for where the white ribbon cable
goes.

On my robot, The sonar cannot turn 360degrees, so having it scan 90 in
front works well.
