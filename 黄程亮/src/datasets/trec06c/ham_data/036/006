Some people had difficulty with the formatting of the Pretend Play article
that I forwarded last week. I've attached a new version of the article. I
hope this one works better...

		Child Caring<p>=0A=0A=0A                   In years gone by, children in=
 Cheryl Silveira's family daycare in Windham,=0AN.H., would get very excited=
 if she found a refrigerator box. They could play=0Afor hours pretending it=
 was a boat or a house or maybe a space ship.<p>=0A   This year, when she=
 proudly plunked a refrigerator box into the play area,=0Athe children's=
 response was far different.<p>=0A
                   ``They didn't do anything,'' says Silveira. ``When I=
 said, `Wow! Isn't this=0Aa great box, we can pretend all kinds of things=
 with this!' they said, `But=0Ait's just a box.' ''<p>=0A   Silveira crawled=
 inside and pretended it was a school bus. The six=0Achildren, ages 1 1/2 to=
 5, were happy to crawl in and out with her but, says a=0Adisappointed=
 Silveira, ``They never got carried away with it. It never was=0Amore than a=
 box to them.''<p>=0A   When a box is only a box, preschoolers may be in=
 trouble.<p>=0A   The ability to create make-believe worlds lays the=
 foundation for academic=0Alearning and healthy development, according to=
 researchers. ``Being able to=0Apretend is not a luxury, it's a necessity,''=
 says Yale University psychologist=0AJerome Singer. One of the nation's=
 leading authorities on children's play and=0Acoauthor of a classic on the=
 subject, ``House of Make Believe'' (Harvard=0AUniversity Press), Singer is=
 sad but not surprised to hear what's happening in=0ASilveira's Bugle Bear=
 Day Care. Unfortunately, he hears it from teachers all=0Aover the=
 country.<p>=0A   Martha Smith, who runs a three-day-a-week laboratory=
 preschool at Ipswich=0AHigh School as part of the child development=
 curriculum, sees the lack of=0Aimagination most in children's artwork. ``It=
 used to be that kids would prefer=0Aa blank piece of paper for coloring and=
 they'd create elaborate stories to go=0Awith the drawing. Now,'' she says,=
 ``they either want a coloring book or they=0Awant us to tell them what to=
 draw.'' Smith, who has worked with preschoolers=0Afor seven years, laments,=
 ``They look to the adults for how things should be=0Arather than pretend=
 how they'd like them to be.'' <p>=0A   There's no single, overarching=
 reason why teachers are seeing less pretend=0Aplay. Silveira attributes it=
 to too much TV and computer time. Singer says=0Ait's that, plus too many=
 programmed activities at too young an age, and=0Aoverworked parents with=
 too little time to play. Early childhood educator Mary=0AMindess of Lesley=
 College has another theory. <p>=0A   ``Society in general doesn't value=
 play as a learning process,'' she says.=0A``We want results, as in test=
 results, so we push academics too early, letters=0Aand words at age 3. The=
 message kids get is that pretending isn't valuable.''<p>=0A   Perhaps the=
 best way for adults to understand pretend play is to think of=0Ait as a=
 filter that enables young children to view the complicated pieces of=0Athei=
r world up close and transform them into pieces they can manage. Because=0Ai=
t is every-day experiences that loom largest, these are what children=
 most=0Aneed to examine and own.<p>=0A   Consider how the preschooler=
 watches several times a day as mom stops what=0Ashe's doing and gets very=
 busy in the kitchen with her noisy, shiny objects.=0AWhat is she doing? Why=
 can't she play anymore? This must be very important.<p>=0A   By playing=
 kitchen herself, a preschooler not only imitates the role of=0Amom, she=
 becomes mom, says early childhood educator Edgar Klugman. ``First,=0Ashe=
 studies the person. Then she imitates the actions, even the speech=
 and=0Amovements. The more mom engages with her -- `To scramble an egg, I=
 crack it=0Aagainst a bowl' -- the more a child learns rules of the role,''=
 he says.<p>=0A   The more imagination a child brings to the play, the=
 richer the experience.=0AIndeed, research shows that elaborate imaginary=
 play leads to increased=0Alanguage comprehension, vocabulary,=
 problem-solving skills, attention span,=0Acooperation, empathy, and social=
 skills, according to Klugman, a professor at=0AWheelock College who is=
 known for his research on children's imaginary play. <p>=0A   On the other=
 side of the coin, research shows that children who have little=0Aor poor=
 experience with imaginary play are more aggressive in later years,=0Ahave=
 less self-control and less success with learning.<p>=0A   The positive=
 payoffs begin to accrue as early as kindergarten and first=0Agrade and=
 continue through adulthood, says Klugman. ``Without the rich=0Aexperience=
 of imaginary play as a child, an adult is very limited. Leaders=0Atend to=
 have had very good play experiences,'' he says.<p>=0A   Here's how=
 make-believe play  fosters development in three areas:<p>=0A   -=
 Emotionally. ``Because a child plays out feelings as well as roles, it=0Aha=
s a cathartic effect: The things he's worried about will play out,''=
 says=0AMindess, who is coordinator and founder of the New England=
 Kindergarten=0AConference.<p>=0A   Perhaps he was in a car accident with=
 daddy. In his play, he'll re-create=0Athe accident over and over, she says,=
 until he has control of the events and=0Athe feelings are less scary. =
 Parents typically don't even realize this is=0Ahappening, partly because=
 we're too literal and don't recognize the play for=0Awhat it is, says=
 Mindess, and partly because children don't need realistic=0Aprops.=
 ``They're very good at using objects as symbols, a block for a car,=
 for=0Ainstance,'' she says.<p>=0A   - Intellectually. As he observes=
 something and acts it out, he learns about=0Ait. Every week, the 4-year-old=
 goes to the grocery store. At first, he is=0Aintrigued by the cashier, then=
 watchful of him. One day in his imaginary play,=0Ahe is the cashier. The=
 next trip to the store, he watches more carefully=0Abecause his play has=
 made more aware of nuances. He sees something he didn't=0Asee before,=
 perhaps the numbers on the register. Next time in his play, he=0Asays to=
 the make-believe customer, ``You owe me 10-teen dollars.''  <p>=0A   ``Even=
 though there's a misunderstanding in the learning, it doesn't=0Amatter,=
 because it's a self-correcting process,'' says Mindess. ``He'll=
 learn=0Acorrect numbers another time. What's more important is that the=
 pretending=0Agives the brain the opportunity to make more and more links.''=
 The more links=0Athere are, the more information the brain can take in, and=
 that makes a child=0Amore open to more experiences. In other words, Mindess=
 says, the concrete=0Aprovides the basis for pretend play, but the=
 pretending helps a child make it=0Aher own and learn. <p>=0A   - Morally.=
 Because children use play to work through their own issues,=0Apretending=
 may start off as imitation but quickly branch out to reflect a=0Achild's=
 perceptions. It's in this way that values get absorbed, says Mindess.=0AShe=
 gives an example of a preschooler with a new-born brother who is caring=0Af=
or her doll, much like mommy cares for the baby, except that suddenly=
 she=0Ahits the doll and says, ``You're a bad baby!'' It's through that=
 process, she=0Asays, that a child's conscience develops: She's working out=
 for herself the=0Amoral value of knowing it's wrong to hit the baby at the=
 same time she's=0Acoping with feelings of jealousy. ``Without the=
 opportunity to hit the doll,=0Athe feelings are pent up and the child won't=
 be as free to incorporate the=0Apositive values,'' or to keep from acting=
 on the negative ones, says Mindess. <p>=0A   The more parents or caregivers=
 can engage in pretend play with a child, the=0Amore likely it is a child=
 will make believe on her own, and the more learning=0Awill occur.=
 ``Sometimes you just need to provide objects and show an=0Ainterest,'' says=
 Klugman. Other times, as with the children in Silveira's=0Acare,  ``You=
 have to literally show them,'' says Singer.<p>=0A    It takes energy,=
 interest, and know-how and some parents are either=0Aclueless or=
 uncomfortable with pretending. It's so important, though, that=0ASinger has=
 a new project in New Haven to teach low-income parents how to=0Aencourage=
 imaginary play. Most popular is the restaurant game: <p>=0A   ``You imagine=
 you're in a restaurant and you sit at the table and you take=0Aturns being=
 the waiter and the customer: `Oh, I have two friends with me, so I=0Aneed=
 three seats.' Suddenly your child's not just having fun playing with=
 you,=0Ahe's learning numbers and words, like appetizer, and  he's learning=
 social=0Aamenities,'' says Singer. ``We pitch that it helps with school=
 readiness,=0Awhich it does,'' he says. <p>=0A    But it's even more basic=
 than that. Pretend play is practice of real-life=0Askills. ``It's a=
 rehearsal,'' says Mindess.<p>=0A   AFTERTHOUGHT -- Recommended reading:=
 ``Ritalin Nation, Rapid-Fire Culture=0Aand the Transformation of Human=
 Consciousness'' by Richard DeGrandpre=0A(Norton).<p>=0A<center>SIDEBAR<p>=
=0AGAMES CHILDREN PLAY<p>=0A</center>   - As important as it is for parents=
 to be encouraging and involved in=0Apretend play, it's also important to=
 back off once her imagination is ignited.=0AThere's no bigger damper to=
 creativity than a parent who takes over the play. <p>=0A   - Children don't=
 need store-bought toys for pretend play. Improvising with=0Awhatever is=
 around the house is often better.  <p>=0A   - Observing a child's pretend=
 play can give you a window into the issues=0Ashe's working on, but even if=
 you don't like what you see, don't scold her for=0Athe content of her play.=
 If it's troublesome to you, talk to a professional=0Aabout it.  <p>=0A   -=
 There's nothing wrong with a 3-year-old who only piles blocks up and=0Aknoc=
ks them down, but you can try to engage his imagination with a story=0Aaroun=
d his play: ``Once there was a big tall tower that was the biggest=0Abuildin=
g in the city, but one day there was a giant who had such a powerful=0Asneez=
e he could make buildings fall down. One day he had a terrible cold.=
 .=0A.''<p>=0A   - By age 4, children typically engage peers in elaborate=
 pretend play where=0Athey use props. Interacting with each other -- ``Don't=
 you know waiters don't=0Asay that?!'' -- they learn from each other ways to=
 interpret various roles.<p>=0A   - Reading daily to your child or telling=
 her stories is the best way to=0Aencourage pretend play.<p>=0AMELTZ ;01/20 =
