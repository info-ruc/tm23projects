Subject: Polaroid Sonar problems
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi!
 I know this has been dealt with before, yet I couldn't find a good
answer in the mailing list archive.
Maybe someone could give me a hand, I've been having problems with the
sonar connected to my HB.
I followed the directions on the web page, added the capacitor on C7 and
still, when using the  function  SONAR_DISPLAY() I get values ranging
from about 400 to 600, with no apparent consistency. (readings which are
wrong when converted to distance)
I tried using one in ten readings or averaging one in three or more, but
except for a random spike every now and then, there is no change.

I would appreciate any advice or help,

Thanks in advance,
                   Guy.
