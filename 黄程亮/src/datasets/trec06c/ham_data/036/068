I've been looking into this also.  I purchased the Parallax RF module, which
is very simple to use.  However, it seems to provide a transparent RS232
interface, more is needed than this, or at least some data buffering. Linx
technologies provides a wireless rs232 connection out of the box, but its
not cheap.  Does anyone have any ideas on how to provide an rs-232 interface
to a one-way serial data stream (0-5V)?
