You can get an Audio/Video transmitter that uses UHF from Marlin P. Jones
(www.mpja.com) for $18.95. It has standard RCA female inputs for 1V P/P
Video @ 75 ohms and .1-1V RMS audio @ 600 ohms (they sell an audio board
for $3.95).  Both run on 12V.   Output is set to channel 16, so you either
need a TV or TV tuner for your PC.  The transmitter is #11064-TV, and the
audio board is #11534-ST.  (pages  34 and 135 in their catalog 98-12).

Have fun!
