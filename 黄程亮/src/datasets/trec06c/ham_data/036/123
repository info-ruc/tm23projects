I recall seeing a Video transmitter "Video sender" at Biway a while back 
actually i own one.  It transmittes on the UHF and the picture quality 
is quite good.  It's the size a colts package just twice the height, and 
only $20 Canadian.  It has a audio and video input.

I seem to recall seeing serveral kits that weren't too expensive, both 
online
and at the neighborhood electronics parts store. This would commonly be 
used
to transmit video from a single VCR or cable box to any TV in your 
house.
