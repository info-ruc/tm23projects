That would be cool.  I was looking very closely at the RM and HP series
because a few months ago we were investigating data acquisition by
telemetry.  That project is presently on a back burner, but we may still do
it later in the spring.  Linx's main issue with selling their stuff is that
they need a solid reputation with the FCC for their package RF solutions
sold to OEM's.  They have lots of literature with titles like "Surviving FCC
Part 15 Compliance Testing."  So...they like to know what you're doing and
to hold your hand a lot.  They *don't* like the idea of a bunch of Linx
modules out there in unknown applications being tweaked about by
experimenters.

However; a pre-qualified kit...

Incidentally, note that the Linx eval kits include *two* complete Tx-Rx
pairs with antennas plus boards, power, and documentation, so the prices are
really not out of line.
