I've had good results using Hall effect magnetic sensors.  I found some
0.1" dia. disk magnets at the hobby shop and embedded them into the
holes in some Lego Technic pulley wheels.  It's true that only about
three magnets will fit into a wheel, but the wheel can be geared up
relative to the drive wheel to give you as many counts per drive wheel
rotation as you need.  I end up with a couple counts per centimeter of
robot travel.

If you have difficulty accounting for track slippage, you might try
attaching an un-driven odometer wheel to each side of the robot,
centered along the length of each track, immediately to the outside or
inside of the track.  The odo wheels can be mounted on spring loaded
arms so that they make continuous contact with the floor.  Mounted
properly, these odo wheels will not slip even if the tracks do, so
they'll give you very accurate results.  Best of luck to you!
