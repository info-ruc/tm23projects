Next Tuesday's class will focus on "toys and learning" with special focus
on "learning through design". We will spend part of the class time playing
with and analyzing different types of construction kits.

There are several things that you should do in preparation for the class:

(1) Do the readings (listed on the class Web site
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/classes/play99/). We handed out two of the
readings at the last class; the other three readings have links on the
class Web site. If you didn't get the handouts, you can get copies from
Greg Tutton in room 020A (in the Cube). As you do the reading, make note of
passages that you find particularly provocative, and come to class ready to
discuss them. 

(2) If you have never played with our Cricket technology, borrow a kit from
Fred Martin (fredm@media.mit.edu) or Bakhtiar Mikhak
(mikhak@media.mit.edu), and play around with it (e.g., build and program a
kinetic sculpture).

(3) Develop a "concept map" that organizes/categorizes the toy ideas that
you all handed in last time (and send a URL of your concept map to the
class mailing list). 

(4) Several of the readings discuss our work on "programmable bricks" and
"crickets" (which led to the commercial LEGO Mindstorms product). These
technologies were designed primarily for kids of middle-school and
high-school age. As an assignment: If you were going to design a new set of
"programmable bricks" for much younger kids (say, 5 year olds), how would
they be different? Feel free to totally rethink the concept of
"programmable bricks". Send a short description of your ideas to the class
mailing list (just a couple paragraphs is fine), and come ready to discuss
your ideas in class.
