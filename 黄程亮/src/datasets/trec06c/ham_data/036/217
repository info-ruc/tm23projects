The assembler is available at http://WWW.CAM.ORG/~mdavies/HB/asm.htm

One word of caution: it doesn't seem to work for really-really small
programs like you might try for your first test.  It seems like you have to
have a hundred bytes or so of code before it gives correct results.  Try
assembling some known-to-work source code if you need to convince yourself
that it works.
