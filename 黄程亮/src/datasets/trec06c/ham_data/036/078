Sure, the IR routines at http://WWW.CAM.ORG/~mdavies/HB/ir.htm can do that for
you.  Just follow the instructions in the readme to find the configurations
values for your TV and for your VCR separately, and then in your program switch
back and forth between the configurations values on the fly depending on which
device you want to transmit to.
