Could a hardware expert (Fred?) please give a more definitive answer to this?
What value resistor should be used?  After extensive IR use with just an IR led
and no resistor my transmission circuit eventually died... I guess I burnt out the
transistor but not being a hardware person I don't really know for sure.

Thanks,
