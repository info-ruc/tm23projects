Here's a link to the QRB1114 data sheet:
http://208.152.152.149/ir/qrb111x.pdf
My limited playing has shown two things: one - the sensor is
very sensitive to visible light and therefore needs to be used
with an auto-calibrate routine.  two - you have to be very
selective in choosing the marker or tape to use for boundry
lines.
