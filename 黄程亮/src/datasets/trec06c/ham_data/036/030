I too have found Gleason Research to be very good.  We 
burned out an LCD screen and they replaced it for me
for free. On my shipment I requested by e-mail the
UPS tracking number and they responsed with a day. 
They don't alwys answer their phone in person, but
if you keep trying they sometimes do.
