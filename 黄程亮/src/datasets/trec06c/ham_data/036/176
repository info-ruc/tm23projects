I managed to speak with one of Linx's applications engineers- He said that a
couple of the guys over there are using the Linx modules to communicate with
HC11's, so interfacing the kit with the handyboard shouldn't be much of a
problem. He said I can have my faulty receiver module replaced free of charge.
The new HP series modules, by the way, are the same price as the old ones.
