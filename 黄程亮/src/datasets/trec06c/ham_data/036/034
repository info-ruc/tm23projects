	We bought about 25 Handy Boards from Gleason Research almost
2 years ago.  One of them had a mis-seated MAX232 (or whatever it is)
chip on the serial board, so that was the only one that didn't work
perfectly out of the box; but it was easy to troubleshoot.  When people
ask me about a source for Handy Boards, I tell them www.gleasonresearch.com.
I'm quite happy.  (Gotta get my order in for some Expansion Boards, now.)
