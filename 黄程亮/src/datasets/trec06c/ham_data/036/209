The numbers you're getting may correspond to the length of the blanking
interval, which would suggest that the transducer is still ringing when
blanking ends.  You might try increasing the blanking interval so that
you're sure to register an echo instead of a reverberation of the ping. 
It's a long shot, but it might help.  Best of luck to you!

P.S.--Quite a few people have mentioned returning the average of a
series of sonar readings, but I think that when you get your sonar
working properly, you'll find that the median is more useful.  It was
for me.

Wendy Parson,           The real problem is not whether machines think,
Will Bain,                                          but whether men do.
