   I'm also working on implementing multiple sonar sensors on the
HandyBoard.
My intention is to mount 4 transducers using Adam Cox's multiplexor.  At
present I'm struggling with the software attempting to reduce false
readings
and increase reliability.  As a newbie I'm forced to rely heavily on the
work of others (use one person's idea and it is plagiarism, use several
persons' ideas and it is research) to lead me toward understanding. 
Most
of what I've found is so basic as to be useless ... with one notable 
exception:  UM_MCIB.pdf at ftp://ftp.eecs.umich.edu/people/johannb/
This paper by Johann Borenstein is excellent, but at present most of it
is going over my head.
   If you have any source code (or other ideas) to share, please post
them.
They will certainly help me, and will most likely help many others as
well.
