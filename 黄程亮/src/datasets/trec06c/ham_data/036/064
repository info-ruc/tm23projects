I've heard that the 100uF cap isn't needed when using the HB's
standard battery source ... but since I was soldering on the
Polaroid board anyway, I decided that it wouldn't hurt to add
it.  Do be *sure* to add the 0.1 uF cap at C7 as per:

Since most of my constructions are LEGO based, I attached my
transducer to a LEGO 40-tooth gear using a couple of dabs of
rubber cement.

I've got mine mounted on a servo on my BASIC Stamp test 'bot,
and intend keeping the same setup when it moves over to the
HandyBoard.

My RF linking hasn't gotten past the pencil/paper stage yet,
but here is another option:

Most all of my sonar efforts so far have been directed toward
software solutions for filtering out unwanted cross-talk.  The
next step will be to add one (or three) transducers to the
single 6500 board.

Enjoy,
