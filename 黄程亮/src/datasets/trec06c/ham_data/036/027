I've bought a bunch of Handyboards and expansion boards from Gleason and

Subject: gleason research experiences?


hi i was wondering if anyone has experience
ordering miniboards from gleason research.
i find it odd that they do not reply to email
or phone or messages for an urgent order.
did we make a mistake ordering from them?
any recommendations?
