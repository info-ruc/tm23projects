I'm still working out the best way to connect two sonar modules to the
HB (using two complete module board/transducer sets).  Both modules
ping, but I'm getting signal contention with both echo lines connected
to the same TIC port.

Probably the best way would be to build a simple multiplexor that allows
driving six transducers from a single sonar module board.  There's a
Multi-Driver Sonar Schematic by Adam Cox that allows four transducers;
see the HB web site, software contributed section:


http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/contrib.html

It seems that, instead of using four digital outputs to drive four
transducers, the circuit could be modified (using inverters) to use only
two digital outputs.  Likewise, three digital outs ought to be able to
switch up to eight transducers, and four ought to handle sixteen
tranducers, but I haven't worked out the details.  In any case, it's
very important that one and only one transducer is switched into the
circuit at a given moment.  Best of luck to you!
