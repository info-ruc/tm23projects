Summary
=======

1. Committee Reports

   Funding Committee
   =================

   Ann Walker <annw@bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   They reinterated a few points concerning the Harvard pay rates they
   sent out earlier via e-mail, namely:

   - Harvard's overall student stipend pay rate is higher (since there
     is no disparity between their Sciences and Humanities).

   - Harvard's stipends are paid out over 10 months--although this
     means a lower monthly rate than they would have on an 8 month
     system (like BU), the main issue is how much students make each
     year (since rent, bills, etc. are year-round).

   One committee member has looked into the issues of Mentoring and
   Grievances by talking to their dept's Director of Graduate Studies.
   From that discussion, they learned:

   - BU does nothing to foster mentoring (though there may be documents
     saying that students should have an "advisor").

   - BU has no method of dealing with grievances for grads, except in
     cases of "discrimination".

   - One way of dealing with the mentoring issues is to produce a "handbook"
     on mentoring.

   - It was suggested that they provide statistics to the BU administration
     in order to prompt changes in Mentoring and Grievance policies.  To
     that end, they are considering surveying graduate students (there is
     apparently not enough information on this topic from our last survey,
     Spring 1998).

   -----

   A meeting attendee suggested that if there is a need to do such a
   survey, they should coordinate it with other GSO committees that
   would benefit from grad feedback (on their own topics).  Others
   suggested that we should seek help from those experienced with doing
   real-world surveys (e.g., social scientists), so that the survey is
   very "valid".  The main motivation for getting this "professional"
   help is in the need to use the survey to justify changes to the
   administration.  In contrast, our first survey (last Spring 1998)
   was mainly for informing the GSO and graduate students.

   Healthcare Committee
   ====================

   Jill Orofino <jillo@bu.edu> gave the main report for this committee
   with some additional information from Rob Pitts <rip@cs.bu.edu>.

   1. A write-up of Northeastern University's student insurance plan, a
      Chickering plan, is now on the Healthcare Pages at http://gso.bu.edu.
      Major properties of the Northeastern plan are:

      - Cost for grads is $841 for 98/99.  This includes an extra campus
        health services fee that is covered by tuition for undergrads.

      - There is no coverage for part-time students (< 9 credit hours),
	or dependents of *any* student under the policy.  Nor can any
	of these groups use the campus health center (they can't pay
	the extra fee to do so).

      - Coverage for services at preferred providers is usually 100%,
        although there are dollar limits to certain classes of services.

      - Their campus health center does mainly primary care, and refers out
        when a specialist is needed.

   2. During the Northeastern research, they also learned that BU's
      Chickering plan has a provision for extending insurance after
      graduation (some details added to the BU write-up).  Further
      details will require more research.

   3. They are beginning to plan a brown bag lunch talk, which would
      take place later in the semester and would involve inviting a
      representative from Chickering.  Issues relevant to planning that
      talk are:

      a. What kind of focus/format should the talk have?  What kinds of
	 questions would you like to hear the representative address?

	 (Those at the meeting expressed interest in ways to extend the
	 BU Plan, i.e. might a dental or vision option be added the the
	 basic plan if students wish to purchase it?  Those at the
	 meeting also expressed interest in knowing Chickering's stance
	 on preventative medicine: Could the plan cover yearly physicals,
         etc.?)

      b. Should we invite undergraduates to the talk (they're on the plan as
         well and might benefit from some information)?

	 (Someone mentioned they believed that Chickering already gave
	 a talk specifically for undergraduates (sponsored by the
	 undergraduate student government) this semester.)

   4. Comments on their suggested edits to the NAGPS's national
      healthcare survey questions have been positive, though the
      mailing list on which different GSAs are discussing it has not
      been highly active.  The deadline for a final version of the
      survey has not been finalized, but is supposedly "soon."

   -----

   To add more information to the question last time about why Chickering
   is prevalent at many schools, they mentioned the following:

   The Northeastern University campus health center mainly provides
   primary care (i.e., doesn't have many specialists), which is the
   same for BU and Tuft's campus health centers (both of those schools
   also have Chickering insurance).  In contrast, Harvard and MIT have
   full-service campus health centers and offer student plans with Blue
   Cross Blue Shield.  An employee of Northeastern's campus health
   center also said that Chickering is prevalent throughout the country
   for schools.

   Someone suggested that the prevalence of Chickering is probably
   because they specialize in "student insurance" products.

   Housing Committee
   =================

   Doug Wright <jdoug@math.bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   They've talked with Off-Campus Housing about getting new students
   (without BU computer accounts) access to the office's listings on
   the web.  They also talked with Information Technology (IT), which
   provides Off-Campus Housing with the computer support to maintain
   their listings.

   They learned that those 2 offices are trying to add access for new
   undergraduates, but haven't completed that yet.  The impression the
   committee got is that it is not a high priority for Off-Campus
   Housing or IT.

   They plan to continue to pursue the issue with those offices.

   -----

   A meeting attendee mentioned that bringing the access problem to
   the attention of one of the deans might help speed up the process.

   Someone pointed out that access is more important to grads since
   they don't really have dorm options.  The committee added that when
   they talked to BU's Rental Properties Office last semester, that
   office mentioned they hoped that when the new undergraduate dorm
   (at the old Armory site) is completed, that would leave more rental
   properties open for grads.  Meeting attendees thought that was unlikely
   to happen, i.e., rental properties would still go very quickly.

   Liaison Committee
   =================

   This committee did not report.

   Social Committee
   ================

   Amy Tapper <atapper@chem.bu.edu> reported for this committee.

   They reiterated that the first social event of the semester (Happy
   Hour at Ri Ra's) went very well with approximately 50 attendees.

   For future reference, the logistic problems incurred with running
   this event were:

   - GRS didn't give enough money for snacks (they offered less than
     they used to for Pub Nights--the committee will pursue getting it
     back up to the usual amount).

   - When they called Ri Ra's ahead of time, they were told that
     Happy Hour priced appetizers would be available, but that was
     not the case when they arrived.

   - The waitress kept tabs for tables and said that students could
     not pay for drinks as she served them.  This made paying bills
     more difficult when some students at a table wanted to leave
     before others.  As possible solutions, it was suggested to have
     students only buy drinks from the bar or to talk to the management
     about the desired billing method before the event.

   - They now know to include "Sponsored by the Graduate Student
     Organization", with relevant web and e-mail addresses, for
     future event announcements (recall this committee has new
     members this semester).

   As for their next monthly event, they provided the following
   tentative details:

   - The event will be candlepin bowling at Ryan Family Amusement
     Center (adjacent to Fenway Park).

   - Proposed date and time are Tuesday, March 23 at 7pm.

   - Costs of bowling there are: $2.40/game, $1.25 for shoes.

   - They would like to buy pizza if GRS gives them money.

   - They'll invite students to Boston Beerworks (across the street
     from the bowling alley) after bowling.

   Steering Committee
   ==================

   Their report consisted of a presentation/discussion of the articles
   in the "Constitution, Bylaws, etc." section below.

2. Constitution, Bylaws, etc.

   Jen Wenner <wenner@bu.edu> presented revisions of the "Purpose"
   article.  Attendees discussed this revised list of "purposes of the
   GSO" and suggested some edits.  The group set a deadline of the next
   general meeting (March 4th) for finalizing the "Purpose" article.

   Kendra Carter <krosebor@chem.bu.edu> presented the "Committees"
   article.  There was little time to discuss this article, but there
   was enough for a quick review of the first 4 proposed committees.

   - There was some discussion about how the proposed Publicity
     Committee might only "assist" other committees in some cases.
     For example, that it was ok if the Social Committee produced their
     own flyers and the Publicity Committee helped distribute them.  In
     other words, other committees might do some publicity work, when
     appropriate.

   - The description of the Liaison Committee sparked the most
     discussion.  Attendees where very interested in spelling out the
     responsibilities of liaisons in representing the group opinion.
     They also wanted to revise wording about how liaisons would be
     chosen.

   We'll continue the discussion of Committees at the next general
   meeting.

   The Steering Committee <steering@gso.bu.edu> will provide revisions
   of articles based on this discussion and e-mail feedback in separate
   e-mail.
