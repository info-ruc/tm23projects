Salt Lake Java SIG - February Meeting

When:  Tuesday night, Feb.23, 1999    7:00 - 8:00 PM
Where: Room 110 EMCB (Eng.& Mines Classroom Bldg.), UofU Campus

Robert Morelli, Paul Hill, and Bill Harris, will present an introduction

to JFC (Java Foundation Classes) and Swing at our next meeting.
JFC/Swing provides a lightweight, flexible, set of GUI components.
It is based upon an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture
and supports a Programmable-Look-And-Feel (PLAF).  Most
serious Java programming which involves user interfaces will likely
use Swing.  Some of the example code is already downloadable
from our web site.  For more info, go to:

Thanks, Bill Harris
