HB fans,

A few questions for ya ...

I just received my polaroid 6500 sonar module from wirz. Cool 
little gadget. I have the HB expansion board from gleason. 
Installation looks pretty straightforward with the expansion
board, since the pins on the cable connector only fit one 
way onto the board, and the contact side of the ribbon cable 
is obvious. But ...

1) Is everybody adding the 100uf 16 volt capacitor to prevent
   power dips (per http://www.robotics.com/arobot/sonar.html)? 
   I have to wonder why wirz doesn't ship the boards with 
   this peice or even recommend it on their web site or in
   their documentation. Any opinions would be appreciated.

2) I like the "cap" around the transducer as illustrated in 
   this picture of the "RadStamp"

     http://www.milinst.demon.co.uk/radar.htm

   Does anyone know where I can get such a cap, or what 
   other (plumbing?) materials you are using?

3) I also like how the RadStamp attaches the transducer to
   a stepper motor. Any recommendations on an appropriate 
   motor for such an application, to be driven by the 
   HB expansion servo control outputs? Would a standard 
   R/C servo work for this, or do I need a special stepper
   motor (or is there a difference in these terms).

4) I want to hook up RF transcievers to the handy board
   and my laptop for wireless RS232 comms. I have been 
   researching this and am quite confused. There seems 
   to be quite a few options. 

     - I have had recommendations for SIMA from pontech
       (http://www.pontech.com/PRODUCTS/sima/index.htm)
       but it looks so big, it's unclear how big the 
       remote module is or what it looks like.

     - I have also looked at the Linx Technologies site
       (http://www.linxtechnologies.com/f_modules.html)
       but I'm not sure which module would be the best 
       choice for the HB or how difficult it would be 
       to interface the module.

    Does anyone have wireless comms setup, and if so 
    what parts/configuration did you use? I would 
    greatly appreciate recommendations for a pair of
    RF transcievers. Parimary goal is to control the 
    board from host PC via serial link, but I would 
    also like to be able to communicate between two
    handy boards via wireless serial link. Any ideas?

Thanks,
Doug
