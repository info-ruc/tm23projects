I'm trying to implement a hardware shaft encoder routine similar to the =
the one described in the Mobile Robots Book for my Handy Board.

I'm using the pulse acumulator for the left encoder and TIC2 for the =
right shaft encoder.  They are both configured to increment the count on =
the rising edge of the pulse. The shaft encoders are the reflective type =
with a resolution of 16 clicks /rev.
the output of the encoders is conditioned!

The problem I encountered is that there is a discrepancy between the =
pulse accumulator count and the TIC2 count when the input pulse train =
goes beyond
a few cycles and both are fed by the same signal (testing purposes).

The pulse accumulator counts are greater than the TIC2 counts.  However =
this problem does not arise if I apply the pulses in a single step =
manner.

The TIC2 is serviced by an interrupt handler routine that is always =
running.

Question:

1) Is this problem caused by the interrupt handler routine missing a =
pulse?

2) Is it better to implement both shaft encoders in the same interrupt =
routine?

Any suggestions are welcome=20

Thanks in advance=20
