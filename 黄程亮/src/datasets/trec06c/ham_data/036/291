I have a extremely complicated two polaroid sensor set up going on...  I 
had a diode connected to each of the ECHO lines so that I can combine the 
two lines together...  However, no signal passes through this setup...  
However, I have validified the fact that they work independently...  My 
question is Fred or anybody else on this god forsaken planet, can I use 
BOTH TIC2 and TIC3 for the sensors???  I would share all of the other 
lines except for the ECHO lines...  If I can use both of them, what would 
be the corresponding addresses that I would need to poke and clear to 
make this work???  I have no clue as to where to look up this 
information, so I decided to just ask this question...  I would 
appreciate a speedy response...


Ian
