Subject: Sharp Ir and Eltec 442 Pyro detector

Hi guys, I was wondering if anyone of you could help me. I'm trying to 
connect a hacked version of a Sharp GP1U58Y Ir detector(hacked so it is 
now analog instead of digital) to the HB so as I could use it for Ir 
Proximity sensing or distance measurement. Problem is whenever I do try 
to connect it to any of the analog inputs of the HB, I always get the 
same reading of 255 but it works fine as a stand alone. I tested it by 
connecting it to a breadboard, V = 5 same as the HB, and I connected the 
output to a digital VOM, the VOM would give me output voltage readings 
that are proportional to the distance of an object placed in front of 
the Ir detector meaning that there is nothing wrong with the detector. 
I'm also trying to connect an Eltec 442 pyro detector to the HB with no 
luck at all at making it work. The HB gives out the same reading of 255. 
Any help would REALLY be appreciated. Thanks for your time.
