hi,

looks like i cannot find the shell script (as11_icb) that
assembles an asm file and packs it into an icb file.
in theory it should be with the pcode source distribution
but it doesn't seem to be there. i'm sure i am missing something.

could someone point me to it?

thanks in advance,

--carlos
