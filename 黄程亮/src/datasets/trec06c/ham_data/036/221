Ok... both of my sonars are now fully functional and clicking like they 
should...  I took the test prgram from the website and changed some of 
the values to make it use D3 for the other sensor...  Here is my problem 
though...  When I output the values from the sensors to the LCD display, 
they appear to be random numbers...  Any clues as to what is wrong???  
Any suggestions would be appreciated...

Ian
