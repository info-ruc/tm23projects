Can anyone help? My team is trying to get a shaft encoder to work, but
cannot find a chip that will work correctly to count the black and white
stripes on the wheel. We would like to use a chip which can be connected
directly to the digital inputs without extra external hardware. The book
"Mobile Robots: From inspiration to implementation" recommends a
photoreflector by Hamamatsu Photonics, but I was not able to locate it. It
seems to be absolete. Any help would be appreciated.

 Thanks,
   Kathy
