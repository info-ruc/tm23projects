Hi all,

I've been looking for some way to connect multiple devices (Handyboards, other
68HC11's, PIC's, custom devices, & PC's).

From what I can find, I2C is the Phillips protocol which is well documented
and supported.  (Docs, Specilaized chips, etc...)  SPI, on the other hand is
built in to the 68HC11 and hence the handyboard.

However, I can't seem to find much documentation other than chapter 8 of the
Motorola 68HC11 handbook.  From scanning this information, I don't find alot
of interface chips that can easily implement SPI like there are for I2C.  Am I
missing something, or are these protocols not really on parallel paths like I
thought.

Does anyone know of a hobbiest writup on how to interface multiple devices up
to the SPI port of the 68HC11?

Has anyone sucessfully connected more than 2 devices using the SPI lines of
the handyboard?  If so, any pointers to docs would be appreciated!!!!

Thanks!
Gerald
