I did some reading about the new PSC1000 CPU, and it seems like the
ideal next step in the evolution of hobby/research robot controllers.  I
especially like the support for Java and networks.  Not being a hardware
expert myself, I wouldn't know how to design a new board either, but I
would be first in line to buy a board based on this chip.

Wendy Parson,           The real problem is not whether machines think,
Will Bain,                                          but whether men do.
