If you're looking for a reasonably large robot base, you might want to check
out "Toys 'R' Us"; there's a battery powered kid's vehicle called the "Wild
Thing" at our local store for $149.  It's basically about a 3 foot diameter
cylinder about 1 foot tall, with a 6 or 8" motorized wheel under the left
and right sides, a battery, and a seat with some simple controls.  You could
bolt a computer in the seat, wire up a couple of h-bridge motor drivers, and
be on your way.  This would be particularly suited for an outdoor robot, as
it's a bit big and clumsy for indoors...
