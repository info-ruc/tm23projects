What type of IR component do I need to attach to the Handyboard to allow the
IR output to function?  Searching the FAQ and documentation only showed the
connection circuit up to the point of the header strip.  I assume it
wouldn't be the same as the Sharp IS1U60 demodulator.  

And, BTW, a big thanks to Max Davies for his IR input routines and web page
that allows easy configuration of the IR input from a remote!
