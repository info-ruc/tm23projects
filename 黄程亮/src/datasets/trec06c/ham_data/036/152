Jon,
I had the same question a while back and was overwhelmed with the number 
of handy board enthusiasts who clued me into BG Micro.  I checked their 
website, searched for MC68HC11A1FN and sure enough!  --there it is for 
less than $7.  (Incidentally, it's NOT in their little yellow 
"newspaper-print" catalog.  Perhaps that's the source of the mix-up.)

Good luck and have a good day.
Steve
