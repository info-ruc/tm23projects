	We assembled the HandyBoard ourselves and everything seemed to go great.
However, the new set of analog inputs does not seem to be reading in values
correctly.  The input always seems to be stuck at 250 (The handyboards
inputs still work fine.)  I've checked the digital ports on the expansion
board and they work fine.  Is there a separate connection for the expansion
board besides where it plugs into the old LCD ports???

Thanks
James
