I just finished wiring up the HB for dual sonar sensors...  A couple of 
problems...  The first and most important is the fact that the values 
returned look to be completely random and often flipping between positive 
and negative values...  Could this be a wiring problem in that the 
signals are not going through properly???  I am going to go through the 
wiring once more...  Also the second sensor is not firing at all...  I 
think that I will check the program later on to see if there is a bug or 
something...  Any remarks to help me get this thing working would be 
greatly appreciated...

Ian
