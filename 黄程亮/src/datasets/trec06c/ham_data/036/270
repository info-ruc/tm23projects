Subject: Diodes for sonar don't cut it
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I promised to update all you ultrasonic types on my progress (or lack
thereof) in connecting two sonar modules to the HB.

Well, I still haven't figured out if there's a way to connect two sonar
module echo lines to the same TIC port on the HB.  The two seem to
contend with each other.

I tried running each echo signal through a switching diode and then into
the TIC port, but the voltage drop across the diodes must be too large,
because it just gives me junk readings now.

Back to the drawing board, I guess.  I might try using a digital OR gate
next, unless anyone else has a better suggestion?

If that doesn't work, I guess I'll give up on using two sonar module
boards and just build a multiplexor to switch the transducers from a
single sonar module board.  Once I get the HB expansion board, that will
probably be the better way to go anyway.
