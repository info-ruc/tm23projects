	Has anyone connected more than one sonar sensor to the handyboard?  I'm
looking to use the handyboard to connect six sonar sensors to my pc via the
parallel port.  I'm using C to talk to and readback from the parallel port.
 The sensors can be fired and read in sequence, as long as they can be
fired and read back quickly.
	I'm using the sensors to grid out a room in order to locate people in a
space and track their movements.  The space is typically about 12' long.
I'm not a hardware expert, but am somewhat adept at building circuits.
Therefore, as much detail on how to handle and build this interface would
be helpful.

Thanks,
Elliot Anderson
