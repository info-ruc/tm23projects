Many optically black materials do not at all affect the IR range of the spectrum.
It is possible that your black object is not black (read "absorbant") to IR
and simply reflects it just like the white. Try several different materials.
Many may even be IR transparent and allow objects behind them to reflect and
trigger the IR sensor but at a distance you weren't expecting.
