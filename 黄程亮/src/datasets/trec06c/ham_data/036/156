	What you see as black and what is black to IR may be different.  I did some
experiments for a line following race, and found that some black markers
actually made the paper reflect IR better than plain white paper.  The
conclusion of my experiments were that "Marks A Lot" permanent marker did the
best at absorbing the IR light.  Try this and see if your sensor works better.
