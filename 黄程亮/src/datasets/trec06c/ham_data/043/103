	But isn't the supply voltage also the reference for the D/A
converter?  If the reference drifts, the signal through the divider
leg will also drift?  I remember trying something like this with a
variety of fixed resistors in an analog port, and had the board dump
values every second out the serial port to a terminal capture until
the batteries died.  IIRC, the analog() values were constant until a
couple seconds before power failure, and then they fell only 1 or 2
units out of 256.
