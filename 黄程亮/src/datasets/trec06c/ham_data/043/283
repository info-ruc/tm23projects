Hi,

I'm not sure if I recently had a day dream about interfacing sonars directly 
with the parallel port, or I actuallydid see a web resource containing such 
info...

Has anyone here seen such resource, or had the same day trip ?

Best,

Andre Philippi.

BTW: I'd like to thank everybody (and mostly Fred Martin and Will Bain) that 
has spent kindly time answering my eletronic newbie questions... Your 
attention have been most helpfull... Once again, thank you a lot...
