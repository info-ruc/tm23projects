If you connect the batteries in parallel you will increase the current
which is something i'm not sure you want to do. if you connect them in
series it will increase the voltage which is what i believe you would like
to do. the problem comes because most lead-acid and gel-cell batties can be
recharged using 200 to 800mA battery chargers. standard Ni-Cad batteries
cannot withstand recharge rates exceeding 50 to 100mA, and using a charger
that supplies too much current will destroy the the cells. or on the flip
side if you a charger that does not supply enough current you will not get
the desired charge out of the gel-cell batteries. Ni-Cad batteries also
discharge at faster rates than others so this will be a problem as well.
good luck

Hello all,

I currently have a 12v 2amp camcorder gel-cell as a motor power source for
some 12-24v gearhead motors purchased from Acroname. I am using stacked
L239's and TI motor driver chips to interface. All is working, except that
the motors only seem to provide useful power when motor(x,100). The motors
run when set to a lower power setting, but don't pull the weight of the
'bot well at all. At full power, the 'bot is fine and can run up inclines
with no problem.

I want to add another battery to the existing gel-cell in order to increase
the voltage to, say 19.2v. I have a spare radio control 7.2v battery pack
handy. Of course, it is of the Ni-cad variety. Do I need to connect the
batteries lines +  to + (parallel) or + to - (series)? Will the two
different batteries co-exist well or will this create problems? Will one
battery drain into the other? Will one battery's capacity be drained first
(due to the battery mis-match, not their rated capacity)? I realize I may
have to modify the motor driver circuitry somewhat (I just got a couple of
LMD18200's for this purpose).

Thank you all,

Bob Kelly
