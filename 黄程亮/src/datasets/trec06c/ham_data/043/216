HERE IS MY PROBLEM;I HAVE TO SOLVE AN INTERVAL EIGENVALUE PROBLEM

Kx-aMx=0
'K'IS AN INTERVAL MATRIX CONSTRUCTED AS FOLLOWS:IT IS A TRIDIAGONAL
MATRIX WITH EQUAL DIAGIONAL ELEMENTS.THE LOWER MATRIX HAS FOLLOWING
ELEMENTS:'2*TL' ON THE MAIN DIAGONAL,AND '-TU' ON UPPER AND LOWER
DIAGONALS(THE REST OF ELEMENTS IS ZERO).

IN ORDER TO OBTAIN AN UPPER MATRIX ONE SHOULD REPLACE 'TU' BY
'TL',WHEREAS 'TL' SHOULD BE REPLACED BY 'TU'. NOW,'TL' AND 'TU' ARE
,RESPECTIVELY,THE LOWER AND UPPER VALUES OF AN INTERVAL FUNCTION 'T'.

THE MATRIX 'M' IS A PRODUCT OF  AN INTERVAL VARIABLE 'N' WHOSE LOWER END
EQUALS 'NL' AND UPPER END EQUALS 'NU' AND A TRIDIAGONAL MATRIX 'R',WHICH
IS A NUMERICAL MATRIX.ON MAIN DIAGONAL THE ELEMENTS ARE 4/6
WHILE ON PARALLEL DIAGONALS THE ELEMENT EQUAL 1/6.

I AM LOOKING FOR THE LOWER VALUE  'aL' AND THE UPPER VALUE aU' OF THE
EIGENVALUE  'a'.

THANKS FOR Y'R HELP :WHO KNOWS, MAY BE THIS IS A STANDARD PROBLEM FOR
THE INTERVAL ANALYSTS WHICH WAS ALREADY SOLVED AND I HAVE TO LOOK AFTER
IT,IN SOME REFERENCE THAT YOU WILL INDICATE.

THE PROBLEM ARISES WHILE DEALING WITH THE STRING VIBRATION WITH INTERVAL
MASS 

      NL<M(x)<NU
 
AND INTERVAL TENSION

      TL<T(x)<TU.
NOTE: SUBSCRIPT 'L' STANDS FOR 'LOWER BOUND','U' STANDS FOR 'UPPER
BOUND'.

SINCERELY YOURS,
