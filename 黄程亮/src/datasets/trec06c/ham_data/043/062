Dear Matt,
	Serial i/o routines available in the FAQ at the MIT site for the
handy board send characters. Write a function which using % and /
operators to convert a number into digits. The function should send each
digit as a character along the serial port. 
	Whenever you wish to send a string ("Motor Temperature is ") use
the send_serial_1() function you have mentioned. Don't send a newline.
Next you send the number (mot_temp) digit by digit using the function
given in para 1.
	I hope this works.
							Yours sincerely,
							     Nitin
