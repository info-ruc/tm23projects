Hello,  I connected a Polaroid 6500 to my expansion board on my handy board
and tried to test it but it returnes a different value every time, some of
them being odd values (eg -24567).  Heres how it lies - on the 6500 per.
bd. E1 is connected to the 'metal strip' (could not think of the
appropriate name) and E2 is connected to the base (grounded) on the sonar
"speaker".  There has been a 0.1 UFD @ 50 VCD electrolytic capacitor added
in position C7.  Whenever you run any of the programs in sonar.c, when it
checks the distance the sonar "speaker" ticks once.  But, as I said, it
returns odd values never being the same.

Can anyone help?
