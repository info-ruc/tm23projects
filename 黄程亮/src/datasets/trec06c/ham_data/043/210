Another way of saying this might be: it depends on whether you interpret an
interval to mean "there is a point that lies between the bounds" and the
relation between two intervals to be a relation between the two points
("possibly" relations) or whether you mean by an interval "the set of all
points between the bounds" and the relation between two inteverals to be a
relation between two sets ("certainly" relations).
