This seems strange. I bought my board (assembled) from patrick about 8
months ago. It arrived within about 3 days (to Australia). I was given my
own IC keys and registered to my name. Email response was very quick,
normally only a few hours, and even the few problems I had to start off with
(my misunderstandings, not board faults) were quickly and very helpfully
solved by Patrick. I would have no problems recommending him.
