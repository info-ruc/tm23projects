Anyone know which of the following are the most bug-free?  All were found
at the Motorola ftp site:

	float11.arc
	fp11.asm		01/22/1986, R. Soja
	gmath.asm/gmath.lst	12/30/1988, James Shultz
	hc11fp.asm/hc11fp.doc	12/04/1995, Gordon Doughman
	HC11FP11.asm		12/04/1995, Gordon Doughman
	math11.arc

It looks like gmath.asm implements some more general math function, while
most (all?) of the rest are floating-point routines.  If there are
well-known bugs in any of these, please let me know.  I think I've heard
something about bugs in the math11 library before.

I'm looking for a library that's in the public domain or under a freeware
license (Berkeley, GPL, etc), for possible use in the GCC Handyboard
library. 

Thanks,
