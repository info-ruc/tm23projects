IBM releases new JVM for Windows 

Boston (April 12, 1999) -- Concerns among developers about Microsoft's
committment to Java have led IBM Corp. to release a Java Virtual Machine
(JVM) for the Windows operating system platform. 

IBM is giving away the JVM at http://www.ibm.com/java/. The JVM is for

Austin, TX. This is the first JVM from IBM for Windows.
