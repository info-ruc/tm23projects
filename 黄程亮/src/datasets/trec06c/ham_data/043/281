Yes, you are right.  I choose gp2d12 mainly because - I have so many
code to load to the board.  With this, I don't need to load the .icb
file that goes with the gp2d02, instead use the analog() commands
directly to get the distance.

But be sure to cut off the 47K resistor connection, coz there are some
problems with this.

And I think the price of gp2d12 is cheaper here in my place - 800 yen
($7.00+).
