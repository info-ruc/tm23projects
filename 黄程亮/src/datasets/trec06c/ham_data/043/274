	Does anyone know where these can be found?  I would really like to try some
of these out on a new project that I am working on.  Thanks for any help!

Hello everyone,

Sharp recently release the new GP2D12 (General Purpose Distance
Measuring Sensors).  Which performs same as the GP2D02.

The new product have only 3 pins - Vo, Gnd, and 5V.  Vo is an analog
output, which means you can use it on any available analog ports of
Handyboard.  You can connect it directly to PE0 - PE7.

With this, you can use the analog(int ) command to get the distance.
Much simpler than using the GP2D02.   And another thing, the supply is
5V.

You can find the data sheet in this site:
