I too have purchased a Handy board from Patrick Hui and was more than happy
with the quality of the product. I experienced no difficulties getting it
set up and the accessories included in the package were helpful. The only
difference I am aware of between the Gleason board and the Hui board is the
choice of motor driver h-bridge ICs (L239 instead of the TI one), the use
of a screwdriver adjustable pot instead of thumb wheel, and the lack of
battery case and batteries. I have found that the differences are not
something to be overly concerned about as you **may** end up discarding the
battery case, depending on your project, and the TI h-bridge ICs are not
that much of and improvement over the L239s. I did get my expansion board
from Gleason and have had no problems with it either.
