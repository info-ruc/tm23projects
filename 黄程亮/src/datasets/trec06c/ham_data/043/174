  Well 1.00 didn't stay there for long, 1.01 adds the new keyword:

Record Clock On Time Keyword

<RecordClockOnTime [N]>
<rcot [N]>

	MDSP bit 400000 modifier.  Reset if N = 0, otherwise set.  All MDSP
modifiers are both parameters and switches.  If N is missing the bit is set
and the mode is active.  Setting this MDSP bit records the time that the
clockon in each item occured at across items after the subjects RT in the
.AZK output.  First clockon is deemed time zero all others are from that time.

	This is provided for use with other packages that record data for the
entire item file, ERP and FMRI machines in particular.
