As we discussed in class, final projects will be due by 

			     9 AM on 5.3.

Please hand them in to Kate Tatham <kathleen.tatham@yale.edu> in Bass
336. She will be in at 9 AM and date stamp them, 
so it will be apparent if your project is late.

At that time, also send an e-mail to me, with the link
to the on-line version of your paper (html, pdf, ps, or rtf). 

If you want to hand in the project early, you can put it in Kate's
mailbox on the 3rd floor of Bass, clearly indicating that it is for me
and MB&B 447b.

Good luck!

I've enjoyed the class.
