I was looking at that this weekend.  I am presently using 4 gp2d02's and am
about to order 2 more.  the distance on these gp2d12's is no different and
I think one might have more control over the gp2d02 since you control the
digital output to it (correct me if I am wrong).  Of course, if you do not
have that digital output available, then the gp2d12 might be better.
