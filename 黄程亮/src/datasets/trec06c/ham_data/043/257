Hi all:
   The problem with using a wall wart that is NOT 12 V @ 500 mA is
this:  most wall warts are _not_ regulated, and they have a fairly
high internal impedance.  If there is no load on a "12 V" unit, the
output voltage will likely be at least 18 V, possibly 22 or 23 V.
The unit relies upon a load of .5 A to drop the output voltage down
to the rated 12 V.
   If you use a unit rated for 12 V @ 1 A, then the light load of
your HandyBoard will not drop the voltage sufficiently and you may
experience difficulties.  
   Wall warts are very inexpensive ... don't jeopardize your valuable
HandyBoard to save $5!
