Hi everyone,

I have been working with a first/second grade class for the past half year
or so and they are coming for a visit to the Media Lab this Thursday
morning from 10-1pm. If anyone has any toy demos they would like to show
the kids during this time, please let me know. They are a great source of
brutally honest feedback and tend to say "cool" a lot in unison when they
see something they like. 

Thanks!
