Eric,
You shouldn't need to use the 0d block for normal programs.  In fact, 0c is
what you are supposed to use.  The only time when you need to use the 0d
value is when you are burning the board with the "config0c.s19"(I believe
that is the file ext.). The 0c and 0d are hexadecimal values for different
addresses for the memory.  The 0d is the EPROM and 0c is the RAM I believe.
If you need more explanation, just write back and I will post more for you.

				Best Wishes,
				Justin Jacobsen
