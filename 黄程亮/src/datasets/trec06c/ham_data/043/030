We would like to digitally design a shell for our toy and print it on the 3d
printer.  What software do people generally recommend for this?  I was told
3D Studio MAX is a good option but others have said autocad would be a
better option for high precision.  Given that we have a pretty clear design
and want a shell printed by next Wednesday, do you guys know what would be
the best option?

Thanks,

Jason
