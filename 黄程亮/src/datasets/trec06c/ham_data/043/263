the main reason this doesn't work is the 1a supply produces too high a 
voltage at the actual current being drawn, resulting too high a charge 
rate.

technically, it will work in NORMAL charge mode, but you'll be charging 
the battery too fast, probably 2x what should be normal charge.  so if 
you don't mind babysitting your board and unplugging it when the 
batteries get warm, you could use the 1a adapter.

in ZAP mode, you'll really be pumping the current into the batteries, 
probably charge them in 1 hour, have to be really careful.  also, could 
do damage to the adapter itself.
