Hi everyone. Here is our planned schedule for the rest of the class:

* Tomorrow (May 11), we will have "final presentations" in the class (last
chance for discussion/feedback on the projects) 

* Next week (May 18), we will use our class time as a wrap-up, reflection
session -- discussing common themes, threads, observations from the class.

* We will view the TOT Open House(on May 26) as the opportunity for "public
exhibition" of toys developed in the class.

* Each group is expected to produce a Web page about their project, due by
the end of this week (in time for us to give grads for the course). For
more information on what is expected in the Web site, see the message below
(which we sent earlier in the semester). If you have any questions, ask one
of us...

>Some of you have asked for more information on what is expected for your
>projects. Here are a few of thoughts...
>
>Your project should be a compelling proof-of-concept. View it as a "first
>prototype" -- developed far enough so that you can "play" with it and
>demonstrate it to others. We expect that the act of playing with your
>prototype will give you (and others) a better appreciation for strengths
>and limitations of your concept. 
>
>As you work on your project, you should be doing an ongoing analysis of
>your toy concept. Some questions that you should be asking yourselves: 
>
>* how does your toy compare with other existing toys? 
>
>* what are the core features that make your toy engaging? 
>
>* what types of children (age, gender, cognitive style) would find your toy
>most interesting?
>
>* are there multiple ways of interacting with the toy? 
>
>* are there ways for children to use the toy in increasingly complex ways
>over time? 
>
>* what would children learn from their interactions with the toy? 
>
>* would the toy help children become more creative? more expressive? in
>what ways?
>
>* in what ways does the toy leverage new technologies (facilitating play
>experiences or learning experiences that would have been impossible without
>the technologies)?
>
>* what are the biggest limitations of your toy?
>
>Please note that we are most interested in the ideas underlying your toy --
>not the short-term feasibility or manufacturability. Feel free to work on
>ideas that are commercially impractical in the short term, but demonstrate
>exciting new play possibilities that will become practical in the future.
>
>At the end of the semester, you will be expected (as a group) to do a
>presentation on your toy prototype, discussing your design process and
>addressing the types of questions and issues listed above. You will also be
>expected to create a Web page about your toy (providing the same type of
>information as in your presentation).
>
>If you have questions about any of this, please raise your questions in
>class, or feel free to talk to any of us.
