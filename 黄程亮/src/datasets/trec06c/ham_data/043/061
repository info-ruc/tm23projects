I would like to be able to construct various useful strings and send them
out the serial port (not just to the display).  For example, I would like
to be able to do something like: 

	sprintf(buffer,"Motor Temperature is %d",mot_temp);
	send_serial_1(buffer);


But there is no sprintf function.  Can anyone offer a suggestion or some
existing code for creating and sending strings (that include numeric
variables) to the serial port?


thanks for any information,
