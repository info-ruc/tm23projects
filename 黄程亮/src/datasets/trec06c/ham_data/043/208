There are two possible comparisions for interval. These are certainly and
possibly relations. If you want to make sure that X > Y then you should use
the certainly relation which means that a > d.

If you want you can use possibly greater than comparision by checking b > c.
Less than relations are similiar to greater than. I hope this helps you.
