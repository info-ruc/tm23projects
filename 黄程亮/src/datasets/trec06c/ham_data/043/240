Dear Dr. Faudot,
At Tue, 07 May 1996 15:49:35 +0200, you wrote:

     All cases  of two  intervals comparing  were investigated in my
paper: Yakovlev  A.G.  Classification  approach  to  programming  of
localizational (interval) computations. Interval computations, 1992,
N 1(3),  pp. 61-84. If don't have this issue, I can send you its TeX
version.

                        Best wishes,
                               Alexander Yakovlev
