Peter, I've recently bought a Handy Board kit from Patrick Hui in Hong Kong.
Contrary to your experience, I was very pleased about the quality of the parts
Patrick sent me! Also, his price was very competitive to Gleason's (which was the
reason why I chose Patrick in the first place).
So: without any doubt I can recommend Patrick as Handy Board supplier.

Best regards,

Marc Katz
