Umm, yes. But only if the battery is 5volts. Presumably, the voltage
regulator on the HB is being supplied with well over ~6.5 volts (usually a
9.6v battery). Thus the output of your divider could be read via an analog
input until the battery voltage dropped below the cutoff for the regulator.
Actually, a voltage just above the cutout on the regulator would make a
good 'low battery warning' point ie ~6.5 to 7v. The point is that the 'low
battery' point would be reached well before the 5v AD reference began to
drift...or (more likely) the regulator cut out.
