I know this is an old thread but I am just now getting to the point where I
can finally start programming.  I am using IC 3.2 and the expansion board.
I downloaded the smooth PWM routines from Newton Labs but I get errors when
I load them into the HB.  A previous message indicated that changes to the
lib_hb.c were necessary.  What changes do I have to make to the lib_hb.c to
make these routines work?  Or would someone who had already made these
changes mind sending me the updated file?  When I load IC 3.2 I get the
following errors and the board locks up when I run the motor function calls.
Any help that you can provide would be very helpful.  Thanks!
