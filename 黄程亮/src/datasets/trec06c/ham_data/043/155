Greetings all!
    I just got the Sharp GP2D02 ir distance sensor and I got it all
hooked up the way that Barry Brouillette's tutorial explained, and I
downloaded the new expansion board drivers, but when I went to load the
Barry's IR drivers, it gave me the following:
Fatal Internal Error:
Illegal Line in .s19 File

Any Idea what I can do about this?

Thank
You..
