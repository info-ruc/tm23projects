Dear Andrew,
	You want the angle that line joining G and P make with X axis.
That is arctan of the slope of the line from P to G.
	slope =(yP-yG)/(xP-xG)

hence, theta = arctan ((yP-yG)/(xP-xG))
where P=(xP,yP) and G=(xG,yG)
	Note that this angle should be always measured wrt positive
direction of X axis.If slope of line is negative, the angle with positive
direction of X axis is obtuse. Add PI to -arctan of absolute value of the
slope.
	I hope this helps.
							Yours sincerely,
