Hi,

    I'm using for my base 12 v geared motors ,without load, each one driv=
es
less than 100 mA, but when stalled, the current grow to 500 mA, wich is t=
o
close to the 600 mA of L293 chips, i do not need more current, but i want=
 to
protect the L293 from overloads, i have thinked in two solutions:

1- The simpler, put a 500 mA fuse between L293 and motor, but i dont know=
 if
the fuse will be enough fast to protect the chip from a current peak.

2- what about to put a low value resistor, for example 1 ohm, in a series
connection with the motor and then use an analog input to measure the
voltage over the resistor, with a 100 mA (0.1 Volt over resistor) you wil=
l
read, if i'm not wrong, 250 in the analog(), and if the current up to 500=
mA
(0.5 Volt), you will read 230, with this data you can stop that motor to
protect the circuit.

                                         What do you think?


                                                                    Jos=E9

PD: Sorry for my english
