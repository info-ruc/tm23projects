Mabey Hui has become better then when I bought mine. But when I bought mine it
took forever to get here, when I eventually got it the box was it extremely
poor shape.  I sorted all of the parts for assembling the HB and I found some
of the parts missing!  So I tried to e-mail patrick and tell him with no
response.  And I bought the newton labs IC 3.1 with the kit and I believe he
only had one key, because it had his name on the key, not my name.  If you are
buying the software I think your name should be on the key not the person you
bought it from.
Anyway, gleason researh is closer to boston than hong kong.
