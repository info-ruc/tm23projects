Hi,

I would like to measure the battery capacity (how much longer can I keep the 
operating robot, running under the present battery), but I very newbie in 
regards to electonics... so here are my newbie questions... :)

1) Is voltage; information enough, to provide battery capacity (left) ?

2) Could I use one of the analog ports on the Handy Board to measure battery 
voltage (and therefore calculate capacity left (assuming voltage is 
information enough for the calculation)) ?

3) Is there a better way to measure battery capacity?

4) What would be the way requiring "less hardware as possible" (but making use 
of the HB), to calculate battery capacity ?

Thank you in advance,

Andre Philippi.
