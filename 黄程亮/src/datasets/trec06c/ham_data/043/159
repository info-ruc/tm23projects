Ryan,

Well, it worked for me...  Which version of IC are you using?  I'm using the
Newton Labs IC version 3.1 but as far as I know the program should work with
all of the versions. If you tell me what you're using I'll fire that version
up and try it out.

Greetings all!
    I just got the Sharp GP2D02 ir distance sensor and I got it all
hooked up the way that Barry Brouillette's tutorial explained, and I
downloaded the new expansion board drivers, but when I went to load the
Barry's IR drivers, it gave me the following:
Fatal Internal Error:
Illegal Line in .s19 File

Any Idea what I can do about this?

Thank
You..
