Dear Bill,
	Mostly you have got wrong versions of your library files mixed up.
Multiple definition of functions is occuring. It is best that you
download all files from the same site on the internet and use them. As per
the new version, raw_analog must be present in lib_hb.icb file and *not*
in lib_hb.c. You must have got an older version of lib_hb.c. Verify the
expansion board files for other errors.
							Yours sincerely,
