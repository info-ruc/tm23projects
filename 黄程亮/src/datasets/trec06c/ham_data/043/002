Jerry,

We buy the machines in standard mid-tower cases and we just put 9 in
each of our 24" racks.  Our racks have forced cooling - you need to be
careful about that as these things generate some heat.  We have not
worried about physically overloading the racks.  We never convinced
ourselves that the premium for rack mountable units was worth it (and we
have 24" rather than 19" racks anyway).  We do put the console switches
in the racks too.
