Scott,

I did a RF communications between two boards before, and use the DVP module.
The only problem is that I can only received data effectively at 300 baud.  I
want to do some video transmission, but I don't have the time to finished it -
I am looking at another product for possible usage -

I still haven't bought this product, but I think it is sufficient for video
transmission.
