Has anyone ever tried having a small offline battery that can be kicked in via
sofware? When the main power source is nearly exhausted it can be put online
and you know approximately how long that emergency supply will last.

>=09I have quite a few battery discharge curves lying around, and one

at

(I

>=09I get the impression that you would like to know the status of the

>=09I personally feel that the right way to go is with a smart power
