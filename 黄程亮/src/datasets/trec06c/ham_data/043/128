Sort of, I've had a FET driving a solid state relay that allowed me to
connect the motor batteries to the system to preserve the system in the
case of system battery failure. However the robot wouldn't move under that
situation since the reason the motor battery is separate in the first place
is to isolate noise. However, since the motor battery was 12v (Gell Cell)
and the system battery was 9.6v NiCd, the CPU could stop, switch the motor
batterie on to the system buss which essentially used them to charge the
system batteries, and then when a certain charge was reached, disconnect
them again and head for home.
