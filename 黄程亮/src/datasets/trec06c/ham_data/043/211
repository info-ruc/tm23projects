Formal definitions for all certainly, possibly *and* set relations are 
contained in a specification for support of intervals in Fortran.

The definition of an interval must be invariant.

Earlier drafts of this specification have been posted to 

	http://www.mscs.mu.edu/~globsol/walster-papers.html  
	
A few implementation issues are in the process of being clarified in the
final draft, which will also be posted to the above URL.  With respect to 
the current question about the interpretation of ordering relations
between intervals, the draft posted above will suffice. 

Regards to all,

Bill Walster
