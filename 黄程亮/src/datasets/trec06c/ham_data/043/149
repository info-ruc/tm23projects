How do you compute, using Handyboard Interactive C, the Sin, Cos, Tan,
Arctan, etc. ? Is there some sort of built in math library file that I can
use or is it some sort of formula? I want to implement some rough dead
reckoning ability and this stuff seems just the ticket.

Does anyone have a function library already with some of these
geometry/trigonometry functions that can be used in Interactive C?
Does it already exist in the Hboard standard library?
Maybe somebody could point me to a practical guide to Trigonometry so I can
find the info on my own.

I am sorry for this uneducated question, but I am very interested in
learning how to do this.
