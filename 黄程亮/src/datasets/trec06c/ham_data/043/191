Peter-
I had a similar experience with Hui. Our HandyBoard kit arrived probably one
month after confirmation was received from his store. We did not find any
parts missing, but there was another deal with Hui's kit. There was a little
note attached to the order that gave us free replacement parts if we needed
them. The quality of the kit was just fine; it was just shipping time that
lit my fuse about them.
