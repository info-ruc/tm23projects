Port 143 is the imap tcp port. This tells me that IMAP is NOT turned
running on the NT exchange server. Need to make sure you have IMAP
running on that box!.

A simple test will let you know when it is running. from a command
prompt run:

$ telnet  imap01  143 - imap01 is the hostname of exchange server.

this is what you should get back
Trying...
Connected to imap01.
Escape character is '^T'.
OK Microsoft Exchange IMAP4rev1 server version 5.5.1960.6 (imap01) ready

If you do not get the message from exchange then it is not running.

Thanks Marty
