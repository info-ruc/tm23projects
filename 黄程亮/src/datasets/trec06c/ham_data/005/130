Ed, your vary rite!

spelling flame [USENET] n. 
   A posting ostentatiously correcting a previous article's spelling
   as a way of casting scorn on the point the article was trying to
   make, instead of actually responding to that point (compare
   dictionary flame).  Of course, people who are more than usually
   slovenly spellers are prone to think *any* correction is a spelling
   flame.  It's an amusing comment on humAn nature that spelling
   flames themselves often contain spelling errors.

Zis iz vary tru!
