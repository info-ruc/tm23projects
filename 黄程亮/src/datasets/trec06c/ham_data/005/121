>> "TJD" == Thomas J Dean <tjdean@astro.ocis.temple.edu> whined:

[Thomas J. Dean has new confusions and irritations]
TJD> 1. It would seem that someone has decided that it would be a vast
TJD> improvement, in my previous "sent mail" folders, to erase all the
TJD> names of the persons to whom I sent e-mail and replace each and
TJD> every one of them with my own name.

That's a FAQ, Thomas.

TJD> 2.  It now seems that mail I have sent out after January 1st
TJD> (i.e., after the new system of Pine was up and running, I guess)
TJD> is no longer even recorded in my sent mail folder, not even
TJD> under my own name, let alone the names of recipients.

That's a FAQ, Thomas.

TJD> 3. Probably related to 2., I note that here is a new line now
TJD> after "cc" on messages sent out, namely, "fcc".    So what on
TJD> earth is this "fcc" all about? 

That's a FAQ, Thomas.

TJD> Conclusion: Assuming not a whole lot can be done about this
TJD> "improved system", perhaps I should switch, as my friends have
TJD> been encouraging me to do, to EUDORA, since it would appear that
TJD> my refusal to switch earlier from Pine to Eudora was based on
TJD> misplaced loyalty to Pine.  I guess Eudora must be the way to go
TJD> from now on.

Absolutely correct, Thomas. Eudora is much simpler to use, the knowledge
base of the people supporting it on the net is much higher, and commercial
software is always better than free software.

TJD> Idea: Perhaps, if my colleagues using Pine are suffering similar
TJD> indignities, I should recommend that they switch to Eudora too.

Yes, please do that, Thomas.

TJD> Perhaps we can persuade the university to just forget about
TJD> Pine. Yep, that's what we should do.

Correct, Thomas. "Heute die Uni und morgen die ganze Welt." 

TJD> You've been a big help, really!  Yours for even further
TJD> "improvements" to Pine!

Thomas? Are you there? Have you talked to some professional about your
problems yet? You know, it's not that we don't like you... It's just
that you have this attitude problem that makes reading your larmoyant
drivel really, really revolting.

TJD> I shall try to send a copy of this, as the "robot" advised, to
TJD> the web discussion group at "comp.mail.pine".  Perhaps THAT will
TJD> get through, and perhaps THEY will be interested to know.

Great idea, Thomas. Please do that. I will gladly provide you with some
more in-depth information about your attitude problem there. However,
since this is a mailing list that is read by kind and helpful people,
I'll spare you for now. See you on the usenet, Thomas. Don't forget to
wear an asbestos suit.

Robin
