Hi!

In the FOLDER INDEX pine displays the SENDER of a message. "If you are 
the sender, the first recipient's name is shown here."

Can you tell pine somehow that you have more than one email-address?

My email-address has changed a few times (partly becouse
I traveld to other countries), and so I often see my name instead
of the recipient's when I brouwse through old mailfolders.
(The alternative of changing the From: Name lines "manually" in old
mailfolders doesn't seem too attractive to me.)

If there is no such feature, maybe this could be a suggestion for further
versions?

Please answer directly, since I am not a subscriber of the mailing-list.

thanks
