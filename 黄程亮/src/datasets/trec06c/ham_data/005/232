When Pine isn't sure of the format of the attachment, it does
tell you to use View/Attach to save it to a file...

Jenn, you need to find out from your local computing support
people what you have available to you as a file transfer program,
and how to use it.  Use View/Attach in the e-mail message to save
the attachment to a file in your account's home directory (Pine
will automatically save to the home directory by default).  Then
use your system's FTP client to download the file to the hard
drive of your computer.  

Later...
