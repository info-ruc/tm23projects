Do you have or know of any drivers that will help us open an attachment
sent to us in MIME format in Word 6 or Notepad.  At the moment when we try
to open them they change to .BIN format and when opened in Word or Notepad
they appear in hieroglyphics.

Please help or let me know if there is anyone else who can help?????
