Dear Randi,

there are quite a few ways to get one's name changed. There is a hard
one, which would turn you into St. Bagley. It would involve stuff
that majorly sucks like cutting coats in two and stuff. Not cool.

Secondly, there is a way that would turn you into Mrs. Randi Cummins,
which would require marrying one of the lamest morons the world has
ever seen. If you're into this kind of guy, you should consider it an
option.

Right now, the most attractive solution for you in my mind would be to
keep posting to this list. It would certainly lead to a couple of
people helping you to change your name to "the late Ms Bagley". This
would not require any additional input on your behalf, but instead the
kind and generous application of fire-arms, baseball bats, chainsaws
and heavy artillery on ours.

If you don't like any of these choices:

[x] get a life
[x] get lost
[x] get professional help
[x] drop dead
