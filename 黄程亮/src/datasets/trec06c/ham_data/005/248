Hi,

 RL> Dear Sir, When I log into my e-mail, I get the following message
 RL> "ERROR IN SAVING CONFIGURATON......."  and when ever I send a
 RL> message i get "write to sent mail failed" as a result messages do
 RL> not get reflected in the sent mail box....While also composing a
 RL> message i get "No room...Disc quota exceeded..."  Please advise
 RL> urgently on problem and its solution.  Thanks Rukn Luthra

this problem is (still) not a pine issue. The message tells you that
you should tidy up your place because the part of disk space which has
been given to you is all used up. There exist some possible solutions,
to be used in the mentioned order

(a) remove old, now unwanted since no more needed files (some old
    mails, eg) 
(b) bribe your sys admin / help desk clerk to rise your disk quota
(c) ...

I know, I've been missing some ways to solve the problem (shoot other
users and get their disk quota for example) ... but this I consider
unprofessional.

After you've cleaned some files your configuration file can be saved
again (perhaps you should take a glance at it, it might be broken) and
sent-mail should work again.

l8er, norbert.
