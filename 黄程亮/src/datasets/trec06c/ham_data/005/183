Between the Disciplines: Doing Comparative Literature 
A Lecture Series
Organized by Michael Eskin, Marla Segol and Dan Sarel

The series aims at investigating the ways in which cross-disciplinary
perspectives can enrich scholarship in particular fields of study in 
the humanities and social sciences.  Comparative Literature offers 
itself here as a common ground for a comprehensive investigation of 
and a productive dialogue on problems traditionally examined within 
particular academic fields. Following the success of the first 
panel we invite submissions from all disciplines for the 
following:

Session 3 - "Conversion Narratives"

We invite papers dealing with the topic of "conversion narratives, 12th-16th
centuries." Papers may address narratives of conversion, using any 
approach. The keynote speaker for this panel will be Professor James 
Shapiro of Columbia University. 


Please send abstracts to:

Program in Comparative Literature

New Brunswick, NJ 08903

The deadline for abstracts is January 22.  The deadline for accepted
papers is March 8.  The panel will take place at Rutgers University, 
New Brunswick, on April 3, 1998.
