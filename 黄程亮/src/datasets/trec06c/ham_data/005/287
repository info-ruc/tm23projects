>Can you tell pine somehow that you have more than one email-address?

In the configuration file, add your old addresses to the option
"alt-addresses". For more information, read the context-sensitive help.

You may have as many as you like. In your folders, you will see the
recipient's name or newsgroup listed if you are the author, and you will also
see the "+" if you are the recipient for any of the addresses you list.
