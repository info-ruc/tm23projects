Hello people
 I am using pine 3.96. and i don't want this pine to be able writing to
/var/spool/mail/.. dir (OS. Linux. R.H. 4.1). However, when pine reads M.B
it attempts to lock mailbox by creating similar lock file in the same dir.
 i tried to set quell-waring-lock-... but it doesn't help. Any ideas how
to force pine to complain about locking or get it using another path for
lock?
