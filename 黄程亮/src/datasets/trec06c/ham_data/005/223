Robin,

Sorry, I zapped your entire message.  However, you always complain that
irrelevant stuff shouldn't be quoted.  :-)

I have an email contact with several individuals who have posted to
pine-info asking about "C hanging N ames".  It seems all of the ones
I've communicated with have performed searches at yahoo or other places
with phrases shown to produce results point to pine-info a previously
holding conversations about that subject.  

The folks performing the search just assume that their seach request will
return "valid" pointers and proceed to contact one of the indicated
sources.

The people doing the search tend to be "regular" people with little or 
no knowledge of the technology they are using, let alone its limitations.
They've never heard of "pine" and wouldn't have a reason to stop and
think about how "pine" can or cannot be connected with their request.

Like it or not, these people make up a growing percentage of the Internet
comunity.  So, you will be seeing more and more of this type of "error".

Yelling at them and making rude comments is not going to improve the
situation.  The only purpose it serves is to foster the image of the 
Internet as and unfriendly place.  

The situation is bound to get worse before it gets better.  But, by their
numbers, these folks make the Internet a cheaper place for all.  So, we
(and that *surely* includes me) should learn a bit of tolerance and try to
help rather than attack.

Regards,
Ed
