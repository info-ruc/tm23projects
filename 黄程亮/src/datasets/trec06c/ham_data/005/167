Hi,
	I have installed the tcp/ip stack on a win 3.11. The problem is 
that I want to compart the HD of a Linux (server of the ethernet).

What kind of Lan's support do I have to put in the configuration of the 
tcp/ip (on win 3.11) to recognize my ethernet?

Do I have to use SAMBA? Do I need a SAMBA client for win 3.11? Where can 
I find it?

Can You help me?

Thanks
