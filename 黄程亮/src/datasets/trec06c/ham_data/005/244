Subject: is there a way to quell the 'delete old SENT mail folder' message
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

"To save disk space, delete old SENT mail folder sent-mail-dec-1997?"


I've looked through .pinerc a couple of times and tried some searches
through the archives of this mailing list but haven't been able to find
how to turn this option off. Is there a switch somewhere?

Any help would be appreciated,
thanks,
steve blood
