Subject: Conversion of motors to Lego motors

This isn't really a question about the Handyboard, but I thought that this
would be the best place to ask.

I have many motors that came with my Handyboard kit (from Gleason
Research), but I want to use them with the Lego kits. Is there an easy way
to convert these motors to ones with Lego casings, etc?

Thanks for any pointers,

-Doug Blank
