	Dear All,
	I notice that a couple of people have reported on this list that
they
	are unable to get Pine 3.96 to see all folders on an exchange
server
	running 5.5 with IMAP enabled. I too have encountered this and
was told
	that this is due to the absence of some optional IMAP2 backwards
	compatibility in the MS product. Can anyone confirm this and if
so
	anyone put a timescale on the release of a full IMAP4 version of
Pine ?
	I'm certainly keen to see it. 
	Cheers, Ian
