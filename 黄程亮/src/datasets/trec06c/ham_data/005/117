No!

>or via a web address?

No!

Of course not. "http" is the URL for "hypertext transport protocol", a method
for viewing Web pages in your browser. comp.mail.pine is a newsgroup in Usenet,
and Usenet has its own URL.

>Any suggestions or help greatly appreciated!

I take it you have the ability to post news articles through your Web browser. 
You clearly don't have a question about pine. My suggestion is, Don't ask an
inappropriate question on the comp.mail.pine newsgroup!

btw, this is the pine-info mailing list. People here are willing to answer
questions about pine, hence the name of the list. If you ask a question that is
asked repeatedly, the answer will be, "Read the context-sensitive help."
