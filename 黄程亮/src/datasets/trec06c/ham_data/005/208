Just for kicks I tried it my self and found that the following search will
hit the pine-info archive right off the bat even though the first document
found is about a user wanting to "legally" change his name in pine.  It
might help if the disclaimer at the top included a little extra
information (ie. What is "Pine-info").  Anyhow.  If anyone wants to
reproduce the search:
