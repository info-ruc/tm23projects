Subject: Any used Handyboards available or PC boards?

Hi,

Is there anyone out there have any handyboards they no longer want or does
anyone have some Handyboard
PC boards that they want to offload?
Or
Are their any folks in the Vancouver area want to buy a number of blanks
boards as an aggregrate to reduce
the cost per board? 

Let me know.

tnx
les
