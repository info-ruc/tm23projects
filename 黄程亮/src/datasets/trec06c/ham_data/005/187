I now have to begin seriously wondering where all this name change stuff
stems from.
Is there a Search Engine weird link thing that causes a simple query
"Name+Change" to somehow return a value of Pine Discussion Group??
When this happened the first (six? eight?) times I thought it might have
been word of mouth...but now???
Anyone got any ideas how this crap winds up here? Better still, how do we
change this?
