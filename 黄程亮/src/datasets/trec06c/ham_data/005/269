Where's MARS when you need it! (-:

Also, did you ever get my e-mail with the ISBN number?  Our mail servers
have been acting kind of hokie lately - Speaking of Hokies (my undergrad),
I guess your Tarheels taught them how to play football over the holidays?
(-:  Oh well ...

See ya! (-:

>Internet hit by "denial of service" attacks
>
>By James Glave
>
>SAN FRANCISCO (Wired) - Internet service providers and Internet Relay Chat
>administrators are grappling with increased incidents of a crippling new
>"denial of service" attack that is grinding large Internet service=
 providers
>to a halt.
>
>"It's probably the worst attack the Internet has seen to date," said Sven
>Nielsen, founder of DALnet, the third largest IRC network in the world.
>
>The technique, known as "smurfing," cannot be stopped with a quick software
>fix, and some network administrators charge that the major Internet=
 backbone
>providers -- the only people who can halt and trace smurfs -- aren't taking
>the problem seriously enough.
>
>On Monday, the Computer Emergency Response Team issued an advisory on
>smurfs, which first surfaced last fall when a program of the same name that
>creates them began circulating the Net.
>
>This newest denial of service attack is much more difficult to head off=
 than
>the "SYN flood" attacks that made headlines last year. In those incidents,=
 a
>server is overwhelmed with half-completed requests for data.
>
>"As compared to a SYN flood, a smurf is devastating," said Nielsen. "A SYN
>flood simply turns off one or two services on a host. A smurf kills an
>entire ISP for hours, depending on how long the smurf runs."
>
>---
>
>How does it work?
>
>A smurf begins when a single malicious user sends a stream of Internet
>Control Message Protocol, or ping, packets -- used to determine if a=
 machine
>is alive -- to a target network's central "directed broadcast" address,
>which is rarely used, but easily obtained.
>
>This address pings all the machines -- often 255 boxes or more -- on the
>target network.
>
>Each of the hundreds of hosts on that target network will dutifully respond
>with a "yes, I'm here" answer packet back to what they understand to be the
>ping's origin address. But the cracker has forged the source address of the
>originating ping packets.
>
>"The (faked originating address) is the poor hapless victim of the smurf,"
>explained Nielsen. Instantly, the target network is hopelessly clogged, as
>Nielsen outlined with a typical smurf scenario.
>
>"Assume that someone on a 28.8K modem can safely send out 337 64-byte ping
>packets ... per second," said Nielsen. "When sent to a fully loaded
>broadcast network ... this becomes 85,261 packets, or 5.45MB of data per
>second."
>
>"That's easily enough to kill off a T1 (very high-speed Internet line),"
>said Nielsen. "If the person originates the smurf from a faster link, and
>uses multiple relay networks, they can easily kill off a full 45 megabit=
 (or
>T3, an even faster T1) line. This is why it's so incredibly bad."
>
>Further, there is nothing a victim can do to regain connectivity other than
>ask upstream network providers, usually national service providers such as
>UUNET, Sprint, and MCI, to help out by filtering the data. But so far,
>according to Nielsen's own experiences -- and those of others on clomputer
>bulletin boards that deal with such topics -- "Very few of the backbone
>providers seem to be concerned."
>
>---
>
>MCI recently incorporated smurf protection features into its free=
 DoSTracker
>server protection software. DoSTracker performs some custom configuration=
 of
>Cisco routers in real time and helps in tracking down the genuine source of
>the malicious packets.
>
>But the DoSTracker software is only useful if one has access to all the
>routers between the target network and the smurf.
>
>MCI can't use DoSTracker to trace into competitor Sprint's or UUNET's
>network because they don't have access to Sprint or UUNET routers, and
>attacks can -- and do -- bounce between them.
>
>Requesting a filter is often a frustrating process, due to lack of=
 awareness
>of the issue and a lack of cooperation between fiercely competitive=
 national
>service providers.
>
>"As it stands, it takes anywhere from a few minutes to an hour to get=
 enough
>people coordinated so you can actually figure out the source of these
>things," said Karl Denninger, president of the Chicago-based Internet
>service MCSNet and victim of numerous smurfs.
>
>Some administrators charge that Sprint has a flat "no filters" policy,=
 while
>others suggested that the company is reluctant to filter forged data=
 packets
>because of the drain such a move would place on their equipment.
>
>"Sprint's backbone filter-policy manager told me that (smurfing) is not a
>significant problem, that they do not receive many calls for help on it,=
 and
>that their policy is to not place (filters on the unwanted data," Ken
>Leland, owner of Monmouth Internet, said in an email.
>
>Sprint could not be reached for comment.
>
>"Meanwhile I have heard from many, many ISPs (Internet service providers)
>that it is a problem, including two local ISP's in my area that have been
>plagued with it," Leyland said.
>
>Smurfs are the most difficult denial of service attack to trace, said Dale
>Drew, MCI's senior manager of security engineering.
>
>"When the smurf attacks first started, what the bad guy would do was find
>just one innocent third party, send a broadcast ping to him, and have that
>innocent third party send all of its packets to the victim," said Drew.
>
>---
>
>"What the bad guys are doing now is finding 60 to 70 third parties and
>sending packets to those people. So the victim gets hit by 60 times 255
>packets of an attack. When the good guy goes in to trace the attack, he=
 sees
>50 to 60 sources of attack," Drew said.
>
>Legitimate network users only hopelessly muddle this tedious detective=
 work,
>Drew said.
>
>"During an attack like this, all the people who are trying to use the
>service can't access it, so the first thing they do is ping the host to=
 make
>sure it is alive. So investigators get bad and good ping packets and it's
>very hard to tell the difference."
>
>Drew said that MCI prevents broadcast ping packets from coming through
>particular components of the company's network.
>
>"That adds a speed bump," Drew said. "But the attacker can forge packets
>going through gateways ... they can come from other sources where we are
>unable to filter them."
>
>Various preventative measures can be taken to eliminate smurfs at their
>source, but stopping them in action is another matter. Not enough people=
 are
>taking precautions, said MCSNet's Denninger. For example, a single
>configuration setting will stop Cisco routers from accepting forged=
 packets,
>he said.
>
>"The real issue is that we are, as an industry, allowing people to forge=
 the
>source addresses of packets that they inject into the Internet," said
>Denninger. "If providers would stop that practice, this problem would go
>away, because you'd be traceable instantly."
>
>Denninger suggested that such filters should be standard on all dial-up
>modem and ISDN ports.
>
>Meanwhile, Nielsen said that the challenges of smurf tracking are as much
>political and social as they are technical. Though MCI's Drew said that his
>company is dealing with at least three or four smurf incidents a day,
>DALnet's Nielsen said he has a hard time getting some national service
>providers to grasp the issue.
>
>"Finding people with a clue and the access to track it down on the phone is
>somewhat difficult," lamented Nielsen. "The other problem is that there is
>very little inter-provider cooperation between the big ISPs."
>
>"We have to hope that the person with access and ability to trace the
>packets doesn't blow us off because we're not an MCI customer," Nielsen
>added.
>
>For his part, Denninger has lost enough business due to smurfing that he
>would like to see serious legal repercussions for the perpetrators.
>
>The problem is serious enough that the FBI's computer crimes division is
>investigating smurfing incidents, he said.
>
>Denninger was quick to blast the national service providers for what he=
 sees
>to be their complacency.
>
>"The national providers that refuse to take the appropriate steps to=
 prevent
>themselves from being used as a bounce point for this traffic are
>contributorally negligent to the problem," he said. "There ought to be some
>indictments issued on this."
