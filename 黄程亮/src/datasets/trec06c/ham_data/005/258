A solution a little less drastic than full moderation would simply be to
not allow posts from people who haven't subscribed--it's a common enough
mailing list convention. Yes, it means that to ask a question, one must
figure out how to subscribe, but it's not that hard, and it would probably
filter out most of the accidental off topics.
