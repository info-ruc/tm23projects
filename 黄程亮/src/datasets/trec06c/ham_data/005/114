Hey Ed? Robin?
I found something odd that might attract your interest;
Running Pine under AIX4.0, for no (known) reason, each time I invoke Pine,
it spawns four pinerc's (not dot pinerc's) and with a letter following,
then a five digit number.
I stopped the problem (though I wish I really knew how) but wodered if you
had ever seen/heard of Pine doing this.
Like I said, it's gone away and I didn't follow any methodical
troubleshooting method, just "thrashed around" in the users' home
directory until Pine worked, and the spawning of pinerc's quit.
Not the most scientific solution I know...any suggestions?
-Colin
