Dear All,
I notice that a couple of people have reported on this list that they
are unable to get Pine 3.96 to see all folders on an exchange server
running 5.5 with IMAP enabled. I too have encountered this and was told
that this is due to the absence of some optional IMAP2 backwards
compatibility in the MS product. Can anyone confirm this and if so
anyone put a timescale on the release of a full IMAP4 version of Pine ?
I'm certainly keen to see it. 
Cheers, Ian
