STOP PANICKING. Relax, take a deep breath, control your own situation.

All the information is still there. What probably happened was your system
administrator got sick of all the complaints of the nature, "How come when I
send mail (or news), the recipient's (or newsgroup's) name appears in the
index, instead of my name?" and changed the setting in the system-wide
configuration file. So, override it in your own configuration file!

As an experienced pine user, you are familiar with the configuration file,
right? You are familiar with reading the context-sensitive help, right? 3.96
has many additional features. Look at the configuration file, and if there is a
feature you don't understand or don't recognize, read the context-sensitive
help. It's that simple.

The feature that was changed is "index-format", and the FROMORTO token was
replaced with FROM. Read the context-sensitive help with this feature, and
choose the tokens that best suit your needs.

You did this yourself, as you explain in 3.

"fcc" means "file carbon copy", which has been a feature of pine since the
beginning. You may not have noticed it before, as it may have been a rich
header, not revealed until you press ^r. If you want to know about it, READ THE
CONTEXT-SENSITIVE HELP.

It is simply a way of saving a copy of an outgoing message on your own system.
Even if you are able to save a sent message, it hasn't necessarily left your
system due to other problems. You don't know unless your recipient tells you
he actually received it.

If you continuously delete the "fcc" line, your message won't be saved
anywhere. In the context-sensitive help, read about "customized-hdrs" and
"fcc-name-rule" from the configuration file. Also, read the context-sensitive
help in the address book for naming customized sent-mail folders for specific
correspondents. And, read about "folder-collections" from the configuration
file and the List folders screen.

Well, if you refuse to read the help text or learn the program, you won't have
any greater satisfaction with Eudora.
