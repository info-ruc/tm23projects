Dear People-at-Pine (assuming this gets through to you),
	I am getting more and more confused, and indeed upset, with the
new "improved" system of Pine 3.96 which my university has installed to
replace Pine 3.91. I wonder if my problems are unique.  Here are just some
of the reasons for my new confusions and irritations:
	1. It would seem that someone has decided that it would be a vast
improvement, in my previous "sent mail" folders, to erase all the names of
the persons to whom I sent e-mail and replace each and every one of them
with my own name.  I don't suppose there is anyway to retrieve all that
information.  Absent that, assuming there is some way to erase own name
and restore the names of the persons to who all that mail was sent, how
would I do that?  (Probable answer: don't ask, it can't be done.)  Even if
it could be done, it is a pain to think I have to go through each of them
individually, find out to whom it was sent, and then somehow change it on
the screen. But probably I should not worry.  I'll wake up tomorrow and
find out that in the meantime someone has simply erased all the sent mail
folders (see 2. below).  End of problem!
	2.  But wait, it gets worse.  It now seems that mail I have sent
out after January 1st (i.e., after the new system of Pine was up and
running, I guess) is no longer even recorded in my sent mail folder, not
even under my own name, let alone the names of recipients.  Guess I didn't
know I had it so good in 1. above, huh?  I trust the messages are getting
through, but it's anybody's guess.  (Hence my question in the opening
above whether you will even receive this one.)  So where (if anywhere) is
there a record of my sent mail NOW?  (Probable answer: don't ask, it
doesn't exist.)
	3. Probably related to 2., I note that here is a new line now
after "cc" on messages sent out, namely, "fcc".  Now when I send out a
letter an abbreviated name pops up automatically on "fcc".  Not knowing or
having been told what it is, I eliminate it each time.  Why?  Once I tried
sending something without doing that, and when it found there was "no such
file (with that person's name)", it simply refused to send the message.
So I went back to eliminating the entry after "fcc", so at least the
message could go out (though, since there is now no record, who knows if
it REALLY went out).
	So what on earth is this "fcc" all about?  Does it mean (related
back to 2. above), that if I want to have a record of mail sent, I now
have to create individual folders for each addressee to store my sent mail
in, otherwise there will be no record of having sent it out?  And if so,
to check my sent mail, I have to go through each and every individual
person's folder?
	I hope this is not so, because otherwise this vaunted improvement,
Pine 3.96, has become an nightmare.
	Conclusion:
	Assuming not a whole lot can be done about this "improved system",
perhaps I should switch, as my friends have been encouraging me to do, to
EUDORA, since it would appear that my refusal to switch earlier from Pine
to Eudora was based on misplaced loyalty to Pine.  I guess Eudora must be
the way to go from now on.  That way I can simply circumvent this new
"improved" version of Pine altogether.
	Idea:
	Perhaps, if my colleagues using Pine are suffering similar
indignities, I should recommend that they switch to Eudora too.  Perhaps
we can persuade the university to just forget about Pine. Yep, that's what
we should do.
	So, thanks for hearing me out.  You've been a big help, really!
	Yours for even further "improvements" to Pine!  Tom Dean
P.S.  I shall try to send a copy of this, as the "robot" advised, to the
web discussion group at "comp.mail.pine".  Perhaps THAT will get through,
and perhaps THEY will be interested to know.
