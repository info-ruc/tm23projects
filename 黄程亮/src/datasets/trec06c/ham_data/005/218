> The Internet has become one of the most popular mediums for businesses
> to advertise their products and/or services. Companies can reach
> customers both locally and worldwide. But with thousands of businesses
> jumping on the Internet each month, it is difficult for potential local
> customers to find your business without weeding through dozens of
> national websites. That ís where the AROUNDTOWN MALL can help. The
> mall covers the Greater  Bay Area, from Napa to Monterey. You can
> advertise your business on the Around Town Mall and gain Internet
> exposure, and draw more people to your website.
> 
> An AROUNDTOWN advertising space will cost your company just $50.00 per
> quarter (three months) or $150 per year with a one time set-up fee of
> $39.
> 
> Call me, Don Pierce at 408 735-1698 or email me at piercent@d2m.com and
> I will arrange to come out and discuss the AROUNDTOWN MALL.
> 
> To set up your mall advertisement, all we need is:
> 
> Your logo, picture, camera ready art or digital image  or business card
> for our graphic artist.
> 
> Up to a 200 word description of your business, it's products and/or
> services. We advertise and market your website advertisement and the
> mall monthly to maximize visitors to your ad.
> 
> Since you already have a website, all people would have to do is click
> on your logo and be linked directly to your website.
> 
> To find out more about AROUNDTOWN or arrange a meeting call Don Pierce
