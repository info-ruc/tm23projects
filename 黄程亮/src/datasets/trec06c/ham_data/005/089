I recently upgraded to pine 3.95. Shortly after I realized that pine
was complaining about creating lock files. I read some web listings of
questions about this problem and found that the only suggestion was to
change the permissions on the /var/spool/mail directory. That is all
good, but, I dont like the idea of users being able to write files to
that directory. I was wondering if sometime in the furure pine might
include an option to specify a seperate lock directory.
