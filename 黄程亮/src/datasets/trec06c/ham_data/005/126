Robin,
        Many thanks for matching my sarcastic attitude!  At least it was a
response from a real person, not the "robot"  However, you might also be
interested in the following reply from Steve Lowe which managed to
overlook or see past my attitude problem and offer some real help (though
I will have to get help to figure out how to look at something called the
".pinerc file").
        Meantime, as to your response, I did look at the FAQ and did find
an answer to one of my questions.  But I was not successful in finding
answers to the others, or if they were there, I was unable to recognize
them (you're probably not surprised by that).
        So, what you could do to also be of real help, if you're so
inclined, in addition to simply "agreeing" with each of my ill-tempered 
remarks, would be to tell me WHICH of the FAQ's (which I note were
numbered) answer each of my problems.  If you're not so inclined, I can't
say as I blame you.
        Hoping (beyond hope?), Tom

Thomas --
As a data center manager, we have made the transition several times over
the past three years to different versions of Pine.  We have not noticed
the problems that you outlined in your message.

I can only one of them--the 'fcc' line.  'fcc' indicates the default mail
folder where your sent mail is stored -- might be related to the    
disappearing copies of your sent mail.  Pine 3.96 allows the user to store
his outgoing mail messages in any folder that he/she desires.  If the
folder does not exist, Pine 3.96 will prompt you for folder creation.

I would check your .pinerc file and ensure that extra characters have not
been added to the default sent mail folder entry.  This might clear up your
problem.

HTH.

then fewer me's. Dare I hope?]
