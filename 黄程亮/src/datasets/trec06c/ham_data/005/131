You know pico, the editor you write your emails with. Yes, it's a
stand-alone app, too. So say:
	    pico ~/.pinerc
to edit your personal pine configuration file. But say
	    cp ~/.pinerc ~/pinerc.sic
first.

"Why does my message index show From: instead of To:?"

No, wait. I suck. You're right - that's abnormal. I just
checked. Ummm... HELP! Are you sure you didn't change anything with
your mail folders? From a short glance at pine, I cannot even begin to
understand how this could happen. You could say "less" on one of the
folders to check if they're ok.

TJD> [Which one, bitte?]

I don't know. It should be one. Whatever... You need to set 
default-saved-msg-folder = <No Value Set: using "saved-messages">
in M(ain) S(etup) C(onfig). From the online help:

         OPTION: Default-Saved-Msg-Folder
This option determines the default folder name for Saves...  If
this is not a path name, it will be in the default collection for
saves.  Any valid folder specification, local or IMAP, is allowed.
This default folder only applies when the saved-msg-name-rule (see
later in this configuration screen) doesn't override it.  Unix
Pine default is normally "saved-messages" in the default folder
collection. PC-Pine default is "SAVEMAIL" (normally stored as
SAVEMAIL.MTX)
FOR MORE INFORMATION: From the Main Menu, select "L FOLDER LIST" and
press "?" for Help... Look for the section "Valid Folder Names".

Make sure that one is properly set and that your admin didn't set them 
to something weird.

No.
