Subject: how to use pine with different email-accounts?
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: TEXT/PLAIN; charset=US-ASCII

Hi.

i have several folders in my pine which are filled by my procmail
with e-mail from differnet servers.
now i want to write an email from the folder "xy" with my email-address
binder@xy;
when i am in folder "xz", i want to write an email with the adresse
binder@xz.

I had a possible solution with different .pinerc, but this does not solve
it proper for my needs, i just want to go from one folder and reply with
one of the email-adresses...

I don't know much about filtering with pine, but could this be done with
an outgoing filter, which does some sendmail? (don't know much about
sendmail either!). 

thanx for your help...

Thomas.
