• HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.

• China is the world’s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China’s rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.

• China is already the world’s 4th largest producer of gold — and will soon be the world’s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going gold-crazy!

• Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed to provide full legal protection.

 Wasteful man money ah guh like butter in de sun. Happiness is not a state of mind, but a manner of travelling  For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life. It takes one to know one An ant may well destroy a whole dam  In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed Night is the Mother of Counsel There's a light at the end of the tunnel. Better to aim high and miss, than to aim low and reach target! Absence makes the heart grow fonder. In the Land of the Blind the One Eyed Man is King The difficult we do at once, the impossible takes a little longer  Better late than.. pregnant. March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb St Swithins Day, if thou does rain, for forty days it will remain, St Swithins day if thou be fair for forty days twill rain no more A drowning man will clutch at straws. Virtues all agree, but vices fight one another  Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today In a battle between elephants, the ants get squashed What goes up must come down Children should be seen and not.. spanked or grounded. Why bark when you can get a dog to do it  No one is expected to achieve the impossible All you need is love What's good for the goose is good for the gander. Take your time and time will take you  It takes one day to destroy a house but to build a new one will take months, perhaps years  Where the carcass is, there shall the eagles be gathered together  A drop of ink may make a million think. The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  Beautiful is not what is beautiful, but what one likes  Always yield to temptation, because it may not pass your way again.
