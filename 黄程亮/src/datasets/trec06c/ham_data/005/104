That wouldn't be very useful.

The whole purpose of the /var/spool/mail lock file is to lock against mail
delivery.  The mail delivery program looks for a /var/spool/mail lock
file.

If Pine used a different lock directory, then it wouldn't lock against
mail delivery.  Then wouldn't be any point for the locking code at all.
You might as well just delete the useless locking code, and accept that
every so often, your mail file will be smashed because Pine and mail
delivery wrote the mail file at the same time.

If you've hacked your mail delivery program source code to lock someplace
else, then you can hack Pine source code to do the same thing.  It should
not be any easier (e.g. an option for a lock directory in Pine), otherwise
people will be misled (as you were misled) to set that option without
recognition of the consequences.  You're really being protected from
making a bad decision.

It's a complicated issue; I wrote a document which goes into it in much
more detail.  I'll forward you a copy if you're interested.
