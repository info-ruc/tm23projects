	My email was updated automatically in the last 24 hours. My
folders were supposedly put into a new directory, but i can not find any
of them. Furthermore, i lost all my adresses saved in my address. One more
thing, am I suppose to receive and send files, if so how do I retrieve
them?
	Thanks so much for your time! 
		:) Jamie
