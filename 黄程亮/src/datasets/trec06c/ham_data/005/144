Robin,
	Many thanks for bearing with me and helping out with the below.  I
am beginning to suspect that, as you say, the problem may lie with how the
local admin installed things when they did the conversion from 3.91 to
3.96 over the holidays.  And since I don't understand all the technical
aspects you refer to below, I think my best course of action is to take
all these problems back to the local folks and see what they make of it
all.  They should be back from New Year's break tomorrow.  Fingers
crossed! (Final word at end of following...)

	[Robin, Good! I take it back.  Let's have lots more Steve's AND
Robin's--and perhaps you'll let me hang around a bit longer too!]
