I think they are submitting questions to this list through their browser using
the mailto: URL in the archives. Unless Robin were to write to them directly,
her pithy observations are for our entertainment only.

The pine-info list is open to postings from non-subscribers.

There is a solution to this problem: Moderate questions posted by non-
subscribers. Move long-time contributors to a hidden, unmoderated list. The
first time a subscriber asks a question having to do with pine, move him to the
unmoderated list.

Irrelevant questions get relevant "best of Robin" responses.
