Check this instead:
<http://www.dejanews.com>
And while being at yahoo!, you should have browsed the software
corner, because that's where the converters are.

BJ0> Can you help me.

No. You didn't state what operating system you're using and if you've
ever installed a program from the net.

BJ0> We have a Japanees student staying with us.  This letter is from

Send more details, then we might be able to help. Note also that this
is the wrong forum for your question.
