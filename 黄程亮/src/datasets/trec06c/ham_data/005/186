Trying to find all components needed to build a HandyBoard, I have a =
quite some troubles finding the 68HC11, which is quite vital, I'd say =
;-). I now found a place where they sell a lot of IC's, but - of course =
- not the 68HC11. but they DO sell a 68H11, and the resaler told me the =
only difference was that this one used NMos technology, which draws a =
little more current. Does anybody now whether I can use these to build =
the HandyBoard, and whether they happen to have advantages compared with =
the 68HC11? They already told me it's cheaper (about US$ 3, while the =
68HC11 costs about US$ 8 around here).
