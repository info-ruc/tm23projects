I sent Randi a message asking her, and she sent back a nasty reply, saying I
wasn't "friendly". Perhaps Robin could be friendlier than I.

She said she used yahoo, but didn't tell me what her search criterion was.

This list is archived, and the archives aren't hidden from search engines. My
guess is that the more inappropriate questions we get on this topic, the higher
this mailing list will score, in a geometric progression.
