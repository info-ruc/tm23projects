Oh... emmm... like "how to change the name in the from line"? Ray,

Sure. We all know that, Ed. The problem is: would you like me to run
you over with a ten-ton truck, saying "sorry, but I didn't know the
technology"?

The dawning of doom. But... *we* don't surrender. *We* don't take any
prisoners either. If *they* don't listen to reason, *we*'ll bring our
superior firepower to bear.

Noone's done that IIRC. We've all been very helpful and understanding. Face
it, Ed, she could be a saint now, if she only had listened...

Oh yeah? If somehow Microsoft decided to give away guns for free, so
that everyone could have even more information at their fingertips,
would you just sit there and say "thanks guys, great job"? The internet
is not an unfriendly place at all if you stick to the rules that guys
much cleverer than you and I made up years ago. If for whatever reason
*they* should decide that pouring their crap into *our* information
network would be a pretty KeWL idea... well, you know...

ESG> The situation is bound to get worse before it gets better.

It's certainly not going to get any better if the people who know what 
the internet can do just sit there silently waiting for the next
glorious toilet appliance from Redmond.

ESG> But, by their numbers, these folks make the Internet a cheaper
ESG> place for all.

May I politely interject here: this is about the dumbest thing I've
heard for years? The internet is not cheap, and if it is to work at
all, it will have to be made a *lot* more expensive. Just look at what
AOL, compusmurf and MSN have done to the net already. Hell, I got
about the fastest machine I ever had - but my download ratios plainly
suck. IRC is being taken over by child pornographers and KeWL WaREz
GuYZ. Even a.s.s. is full of commercial crap. And you want to tell
*me* that the net is getting cheaper?  I mean, yeah, it's being
cheapened and nastied, but it's not getting any cheaper... This
sucks. I hate those lusers.

ESG> So, we (and that *surely* includes me) should learn a bit of

Appeasement? No, Sir, thank you, we've had that before, and it didn't
work then, either. I say, let's stand and fight. Ummm... and help,
where we can, too. }:->

Cheers,
Robin
