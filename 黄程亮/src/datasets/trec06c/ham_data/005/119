If I may interject a small suggestion here,
Since Pine is also a mail reader, perhaps the esteemed list member could
access "L" (Folder List) then travel down to "New Collection" and follow
menu prompts from there onwards.
entering comp.mail when prompted for groups to search for will immediately
access comp.mail.pine, along with other interesting newsgroups that relate
to mail programs out there.
Just a suggestion, which would get the reader to the resource he wants,
while *still using* the resources of this list.
Regards to all, and best wishes for a "Great '98"!
