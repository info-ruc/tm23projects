There's too much that's unknown to constructively help you. First
thing...verry first thing, contact your local systems administrator and ask
that person precisely what you posted here.
We could send you off on an "ls -laF" this and "grep" that and chances are
you'd wind up really frustrated, and neither learn what the problem was, or
learn much about Pine in the process either.
All of the questions you posed can be succinctly answered by your local
sysadmin...too many variables for anyone to have the slightest hope of
constructively helping you.
Try that first, then if you have further Pine questions, well then come on
back and we'll help you.
