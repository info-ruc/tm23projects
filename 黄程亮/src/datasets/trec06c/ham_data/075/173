If the patch that is located at the download page fixes everything then I dont 
think we need to move files around to the other machines.  I will apply the 
patch that was on the website and let you know how it went.
I seem to be having motherboard failures and had to reformat my hard drive.  
It is a really weird error that I have yet to figure out fully and is gonna 
leave me struggling for a few days until I can manage to put myself more or 
less where I was before, hopefully.
Anyways, Adnan's email is:  aiqbal@richmond.edu
I will try to get him started this weekend.
I don't really have any plans for Spring Break and was wondering if I could 
stay here working for that week.  Is that ok with you guys?
