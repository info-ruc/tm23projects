   Only way DMDX could degrade it was if you used the default video mode 
and then it would be converting the video to an 8 bit palette, using a 16 
bit video mode will stop that.  All audio in DMDX is converted to a 22kHz 
sampling rate before playing but I doubt that this is your problem, I can't 
imagine that a lack of frequencies over 11kHz could produce a discernable 
signal loss.


>Is there any way around the problem?

   Convert the media to a non-quicktime format or install better codecs on 
the machine.  There are a number of ways to upgrade the codecs, upgrade the 
media player, install a later version of DirectX, install a later version 
of the OS, or maybe you can buy codecs from Apple.  I was playing with the 
windows update thing and I noticed that installing a later version of IE 
will upgrade the media player.
