Jonathan's comment is correct -- enclosing an item between a pair of $s 
fixes its location, and the other items are then randomly positioned.  But 
if the filler items are supposed to be a random sample from a larger pool 
of items, then there is more to it than that.  I don't know whether that 
was the intent, but even if it wasn't, this is an interesting question.

One possible solution is as follows.  Suppose you have 5 test items to be 
displayed in constant positions, along with 50 filler items sampled 
randomly from a pool of 100 items.  This can be achieved with the following 
arrangement:

n55 f50 s1
10 filler items
$ test item 1$
10 filler items
$ test item 2 $
10 filler items
$ test item 3 $
10 filler items
$ test item 4 $
10 filler items
$ test item 5 $
$0 "That's the end."; $
50 filler items

         Note the scramble parameter value of 1.  This is critical.
