The following is a reply to CCPR report from kowalski@jlab.org


 The logs for our bbftp server show your connection, but it gets timeouts
trying to
 open the connection to send the data.

 Like ftp, bbftp makes a call back to the client on a separate port to send
the data.
 Does your site have a firewall setup that prevents outside machines from
opening
 connections to your host (psc1.richmond.edu)?
