   Hey, don't worry, no one actually reads the help files, why should you 
be any different?

   No, decisions can only be made on an item by item basis, nothing can be 
done as an item is executing.  And before you ask, no, DMDX will never have 
this capability.  All you could do would be to provide some sort of warning 
after the fact and even that would require a new keyword to store the RT in 
a counter so a comparison can be made against it, however adding that 
keyword would be pretty trivial.

   Set the keywords SET and EMIT in the DMDX help file.  You can't write to 
a separate data file but you can EMIT the value of a counter to the output 
data file, so if you have several datum to write you could have multiple 
SET / EMIT pairs in one item.
