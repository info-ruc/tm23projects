Hi Herb:
Herbert Weigel and I wrote a paper on describing nuclear matter in
heavy-ion collisions. Herbert was a Heisenberg Fellow at MIT at that time.
Now , he is back in Germany. I mentioned to him about your QCD Workshop in
Paris in June this year. He said that he would like to participate.
Please send him an invitation. I will ask him to contact you. Herbert is a
bright , prolific young researcher. I am confident he will give a good
presentation of whatever he decides to talk about.
Best regards. Munir

P.S. I have also mentioned about your Workshop to another colleague, Mark
Swanson. Mark is a Professor of Physics at our UConn Stamford Campus. He is
a first-rate researcher and is the author of a book: Path Integrals and
Quantum Processes. He will also contact you, if he decides to participate.
He will be excellent. ( I guess, I have been working extra time to
publicize how good your workshops are ! )
