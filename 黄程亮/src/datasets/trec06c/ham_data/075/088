   Well, at great expense to the management we now have HTML versions of 
the DMDX and TimeDX help files, primarily for people like Ken who want 
their tutorials to point at the reference material.  This is something I 
thought I'd knock of in the week before the university closed, hah.  Let me 
tell you, if anyone even remotely suggests that writing a .RTF to .HTML 
filter (let alone one for windows help files) is trivial they don't know 
what they're talking about, I don't think I've written such a complex 
filter before.  I thought having already written a .RTF parser for DMDX 
would make this cake, probably just made it harder.
   Things are still a little raw, if people are bored then generally 
surfing through them for errors, or at least differences from the .HLP 
files would be a useful.  About the only thing I know about that needs 
attention right now is the ascii art in the PIO TimeDX section and I'm 
still thinking about what to do with that, I might have to make some 
bitmaps for those and that might be really challenging given that it must 
work for both .HLP and .HTML formats, that or figure out some way to hint 
to the filter to make those <PRE>formatted sections, but that's complicated 
too.
