Minutes of ``The Committee to rewrite the LSC Data analysis 
White Paper''. Alan Wiseman

23 January 2001 at 3:30pm central.

Rai Weiss
Albert Lazzarini
Tom Nash
Alan Weinstein
Stuart Anderson
Alan Wiseman


The consversation was free wheeling and the moderator lost 
control early, but the highlights of the meeting were:

1) The committee will revist the entire paper:
   all sections.  This is broader scope than
   Rai was thinking, but there is a general consensus
   that this is necessary.

2) Rai emphasized the need to address the long
   range vision of the science.
   [This is in the current version, but he 
   feels it is inadequate.]

3) General concensus that the hardwiring of tasks to people
   was important, but the White Paper is not the place for it.
   It should be removed from White Paper and kept on a
   web-page or a living LSC document.

4) To what extent the White Paper should address the allocation
   resources was discussed with no hard concensus.

5) The committee agreed on a skeleton of a rewrite strategy:

   5.a) Attack by parts:

      Alan  Wiseman and Stuart Anderson Chapter 2,3,4 
      (the science) and also parts chapter 9 dealing
      with the science ``vision thing''.

      Chapter 5 and 6. Keith and Alan Weinstein

      Chapter 7,8, part of 9 dealing with future hardware 
      Tom and Albert

   5.b) The three groups should begin by writing outlines of 
        what needs to be in there.  We will then discuss our 
        outlines and decide how to proceed. 

6. The goal for completing the rewrite is the August
   LSC meeting.

7) Next meeting: 13 February at 3:00pm Central.
