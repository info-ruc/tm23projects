We are trying to run an experiment investigating the contribution of lip 
movements to the perception of aurally presented (non)words. Consequently 
we made a whole lot of quick-time movies of someone saying each stimulus 
item. Then we discovered that DMDX would only accept quick-time movies that 
use a rather old version of a compression algorithm called cinepak. We also 
discovered that when we ran the files in DMDX, both the video and sound 
quality were much poorer than there were when we played them using a 
quick-time player. We recorded them carefully so as to get as much fidelity 
as we could, and in a quick-time player they sound really good. However, 
when they are played in DMDX, many of the nonwords become unintelligible. 
Basically what happens, is that the signal-to-noise ratio seems to be 
sharply reduced (there is some quite loud hiss, and the signal volume is 
reduced). I am unsure as to whether the quick-time player uses DirectShow 
or not, and so I am also unsure whether the problem attributable to 
DirectShow or to DMDX itself.

Is there any way around the problem?

Thanks,
Michael Johnston
