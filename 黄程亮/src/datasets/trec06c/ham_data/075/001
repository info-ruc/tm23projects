Turning off the audio acceleration in order to get rid of the popping on 
the Montego A3D resulted in a huge increase in latency and latency 
variability.  Thankfully, since installing DirectX 8.0, I am able to 
re-enable the acceleration without hearing the pop.  I have no idea why 
this is, but it seems to have worked.

On another note, we've run into major problems with DMDX freezing the 
entire computer during presentation of 640 X 480 X 16 bit images, sound 
files, and bytes to the output port of the CIO/DIO 24 (computerboards PIO 
12 clone).  This required a hard re-boot in order to recover.  Freezing 
happened when the thread priorities in TimeDX were all set to normal as 
well.  I finally stripped out all unnecessary cards, disabled the 2nd 
channel IDE controller, removed CD Rom, disabled floppy drive, and began 
with a minimal parameter line with no input polling (since we are merely 
presenting stimuli, not recording responses).  Finally, I configured the 
computer to ignore the network card so that it won't be polled while DMDX 
is running.  I've now managed to get the very long item file to run once, 
but since it takes over 40 minutes to complete, I do not know if I will be 
able to get this performance to replicate.
