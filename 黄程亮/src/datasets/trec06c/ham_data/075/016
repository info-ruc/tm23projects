   I've added links between the DMDXH.HLP file and TIMEDXH.HLP so they're a 
bit easier to navigate when one file refers to the other.
   I've changed the way syntax errors are displayed, they should all 
generate dialogs now and you should no longer get spurious warnings about 
missing clockons when in fact the error was generated by something else and 
you had to consult the diagnostics to see what in fact was the problem.
   I've also added more functionality to the <set> keyword for counters 
addressing a few shortcomings, a new usage <set N,text> has been added 
where text can be one of the following:

CounterN        The value of counter N, for example <set 3,counter2> would 
set (and create if necessary) counter 3 to the value counter 2 had when 
this keyword is parsed.

LastRT		Absolute value of the last Reaction Time gathered in whole 
milliseconds (rounded down).

LastXT		Last Reaction Time gathered in whole milliseconds (rounded down, 
will be negative if response incorrect).

ErrorRate	The error rate at the end of the previous item (useful for 
multiple tests against the error rate as a branch on the error rate will 
reset it).
