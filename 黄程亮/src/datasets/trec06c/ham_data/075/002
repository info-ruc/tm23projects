   Some sort of incompatibility in your hardware.

   Like I said, some sort of incompatibility in your hardware, you've 
clearly got some serious issues if DMDX is crashing, AFAIK it doesn't crash 
on other peoples machines.  Even with all those elements present that's 
still a fairly standard mix for me to test on the testbed, while I don't 
regularly test for 45 minutes I admit I certainly have left it running over 
night doing things before to test for resource leaks.  If you want you can 
zip up all your stimuli and your item file, send them to me and I can run 
them repeatedly.  Perhaps you have the interrupt on the PIO card enabled 
and it's screwing things up, I usually leave the interrupt jumper on 
X.  Perhaps your version of windows has managed to recognize the PIO as 
some other device, mine usually recognize it as some kind of broken serial 
device (which AFAIK is ok).  Have a look in the device manager for 
something using the PIO's port number (by default 300-303, we usually set 
them for 310-313), Properties of My Computer / Device Manager / Properties 
of Computer / then check "Input/output (I/O)".  Is the machine in fact 
stable running some other benchmarks?  Perhaps you've got failing hardware 
and the thing crashes doing anything but because this is your stimulus 
machine DMDX is all you use it for and therefore it looks like DMDX is 
crashing?
