              Approximation of Liquid Crystal Flows
                (Andreas Prohl -- University of Kiel, Germany)

Liquid Crystals possess combined crystallographic and fluid flow 
properties, which make them interesting for optical devices
(e.g., laptop displays, etc.). The complex fluid flow of nematic
liquid crystals was mathematically described by Leslie/Ericksen
in the late 60's and is a highly nonlinear system of PDE's; its
mathematical as well as numerical analysis is of much interest 
in recent research.

In the talk, I will focus on efficient numerical realization by
means of splitting computation of velocity, pressure, and
director field at each iteration step. We report on convergence
analysis, both mathematical and computational.
