Greetings

I've read the documentation and tutorials regarding the random
scrambling of the order of a group of items.  I'm interested in running
an experiment in which a series of items are presented - many of these I
want to be static, but interspersed I'd like to randomly place other
"filler" items that would be taken from a pool.  Is there any way to do
this in DMDX?

Thanks for any help.
