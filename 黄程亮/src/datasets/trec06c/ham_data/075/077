OK, I've done all of these things- I've installed Windows 2000, DirectX 8.0 
(for NT/2000), and IE 5.5. I've also installed the latest version of DMDX. 
(by the way, we tried avi and mpg as well- it had the same problem as 
quicktime). Unfortunately, now DMDX won't run any .rtf files at all. When I 
select the "run item file" option, the whole screen goes white and nothing 
happens. A similar thing happens when I select any function in TimeDX- 
white screen, no action. Is this a Windows 2000 kind of problem?

thanks,
Michael
