                 Deep Space 1 Mission Status
                     April 4, 2001

     The innovative engine now propelling NASA's Deep Space 1 
spacecraft toward its ambitious September encounter with Comet 
Borrelly just won't give up, having now run for more than 
10,000 hours -- 50 times beyond its originally required 
lifetime.

     A working replica of the Deep Space 1 ion engine has 
logged in even more hours at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
Pasadena, Calif., where the mission is managed.
  
     The spacecraft's engine was only required to complete 200 
hours of operation in flight to prove itself a success. On 
March 21, it passed the 10,000-hour mark. It's expected to 
pass 14,000 hours by the end of its extended mission to Comet 
Borrelly.

     The ion engine works by first removing an electron from 
the gas xenon, then using a pair of electrically charged grids 
to shoot the ionized gas out at more than 35,000 meters per 
second (78,000 miles per hour).  The engine is one of a dozen 
important new technologies that the successful Deep Space 1 
mission officially finished testing in 1999. Now that Deep 
Space 1 has been approved for a risky extended mission to 
Comet Borrelly, the long-lived ion engine will take the 
spacecraft near the comet. Similar ion engines may be used on 
future space missions, particularly missions to comets and 
asteroids where the ion engine's high fuel economy is 
important for precise navigation to the small bodies.

     "The ground-based xenon ion engine has run for about 
15,500 hours of testing time since the test began in early 
October 1998," said Dr. John Anderson of JPL, the ion engine 
test lead engineer. "That's more than 150 percent of the time 
it was designed to last."

     "The results from Deep Space 1 and testing on the ground 
show that ion engines can be terrifically effective," said 
JPL's Dr. Marc Rayman, the project manager of Deep Space 1.  
"Now I'm looking forward to future spacecraft that use ion 
engines surpassing Deep Space 1's record as they undertake 
still more exciting missions."  

     Engineers partly attribute the secrets to the ion 
engine's long life to a slight increase in the flow of xenon 
through the engine early in the testing phase. "This reduced 
the amount of wear on the engine, and yet didn't significantly 
affect the engine's efficiency," said Dr. John Brophy, manger 
of NASA's Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Applications 
Readiness project.

     Anderson began testing the ground-based ion engine when 
it was shipped to JPL from Hughes, which is now part of 
Boeing, in 1998. "We'd like to test it until the end of its 
life. Then we'll see how to make these engines last even 
longer," he said.  He had also tested an earlier version of 
the ion engine, beginning in 1996.

     The ion engine is tested for about 75 percent of the time 
over the two and a half years of the test, Anderson said, with 
other time spent on running diagnostic tests, and defrosting 
the xenon propellant that had become frozen in the vacuum 
system. At first, the engine was run at just more than half of 
its capacity, about 1.5 kilowatts, and then upped to full 
capacity, 2.3 kilowatts. The next phase of the test will be to 
run the engine at its lowest thrust level to demonstrate the 
engine's ability to run at low power near the end of its life, 
Anderson said.

     Deep Space 1 has operated its ion engine between 520 
watts and 1.9 kilowatts, in part depending upon the 
spacecraft's distance from the Sun during its flight in space. 
Deep Space 1's ion engine now also helps the spacecraft 
maintain its orientation relative to the stars, so it remains 
on for 99 percent of the time.

     Deep Space 1 was launched in October 1998 as part of 
NASA's New Millennium Program, which is managed by JPL for 
NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, D.C. The 
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena manages JPL for 
NASA.

Hey guys,
Anyone interested in this?

I haven't had time to think about this, adn realized no one else mentioned 
anything about it.  Is anyone interested?  Or should I tell Paul we're not 
interested?  I could offer the Lit site stuff?  Any other ideas?

Kelly


======================================================================
Dear m.h. Starks, 


TransOrbital, Inc. <http://www.transorbital.net> is currently designing its 
2001 Trailblazer lunar imaging spacecraft - intended to be launched at the 
end of this year as the first commercial lunar mission. We would like to 
invite the Institute to participate in the 2001 Trailblazer mission. 


Primarily, as part of a consumer product associated with the mission, we will 
be including a computer CD containing information about the mission and the 
Moon. Given the Institute's interest in the subject, I believe that a 
partnership in developing material for the CD would be mutually beneficial. 


If you are not the person responsible, I would greatly appreciate it if you 
could direct me to the proper contact. Thank you. 


Sincerely

W. Paul Blase

TransOrbital, Inc.

<< What did you have in mind?

Basically, as part of the CD we'd like to include a collection of lunar data: 
images, an atlas, history, mythology - whatever could be put together, 
preferably out of public-domain material, into an HTML (read on anything) 
document. We have some material that we'd like to put on there, but not 
enough to fill a whole CD.  I can master the disk, but we're a little 
short-handed, and busy trying to design the spacecraft, and I thought that a 
group like yours would like to take it on. We'd need a professional product, 
terms to be negotiated.

Glad to hear your interested in the group.  I'm not sure how to join the list 
anymore, but I'm forwarding a copy of this to the group list - so it should 
get a responce.

              Mystery force tugs
              distant probes

              The Pioneer craft are heading towards the stars
              By BBC News Online science editor Dr
              David Whitehouse

              An unexplained force is pulling on distant
              spacecraft. Researchers have come to this
              conclusion after a thorough analysis of the
              deep-space probes' trajectories.

              It could be just a tiny
              unnoticed effect in the
              spacecraft themselves,
              but scientists warn it
              could also be the first
              hint that modifications
              need to be made to our
              understanding of the
              force of gravity.

              "It is almost as if the
              probes are not behaving according to the
              known law of gravity," said Dr John Anderson,
              of the American space agency's (Nasa) Jet
              Propulsion Laboratory, and lead scientist on
              the study.

              He said: "We've been working on this problem
              for several years, and we have accounted for
              everything we could think of."

              Great detail

              The unexplained force appears to be acting on
              four deep-space probes scattered around the
              Solar System.

              Pioneer 10 was launched towards the outer
              planets in 1972. It is now well beyond Jupiter
              but still in radio contact with Earth.

              By studying the Doppler shift (the "stretching")
              of the radio signals from the probe, scientists
              have been able to calculate how fast the craft
              is travelling. Since 1980, its trajectory has
              been mapped in very great detail.

              The puzzle is that Pioneer 10 is slowing more
              quickly than it should.

              It was initially suggested that this might be
              due to the force from a tiny gas leak or that it
              was being pulled off course by the gravity of
              an unseen Solar System object.

              Unseen body

              The mystery deepened further when an
              analysis of the trajectory being followed by its
              sister spacecraft, Pioneer 11, launched in
              1973, showed that it too was being subjected
              to the same mysterious effect.

              But Pioneer 11 is on the opposite side of the
              Solar System from Pioneer 10, about 22 billion
              km (about 14 billion miles) away. This means
              the effect cannot be the gravitational effect
              of some unseen body.

              Add to all this hints that the same unexplained
              effect might have been acting on the Galileo
              spacecraft on its journey to Jupiter, and the
              Ulysses spaceprobe that is circling the Sun,
              and you have a Solar System-wide puzzle.

              In a report soon to be published in a major
              astronomical journal, Dr Anderson and
              colleagues have carried out an impressive
              study of the state of the Pioneer spacecraft
              and all the tiny forces to which they could be
              subjected.

              Planets unaffected

              "Our analysis strongly suggests that it is
              difficult to understand how any of these
              mechanisms can explain the magnitude of the
              observed behaviour of the Pioneer anomaly,"
              the team says.

              It has been suggested that the spacecraft
              tracking data have shown a deviation in the
              force of gravity that is apparent only across
              vast distances. It has also been pointed out
              that the strength of the effect seems to be
              related to two of the Universe's physical
              constants: the speed of light and the speed of
              the expansion of the Universe.

              But others have dismissed this as being too
              fanciful, arguing that if the Pioneer anomaly
              was really indicative of a change in our
              understanding of gravity, then it would be
              apparent in the orbits of the planets around
              the Sun - which it is not.

              The effect is as yet unexplained and with all
              four affected probes never to return to Earth
              for analysis, it may well remain that way.

As far as I can tell autodynamics is run-of-the mill kook physics.  If
you think it really explains this situation, perhaps you'd like to run
the numbers and show whether it really does explain the discrepancy.

Why not just read the PDF file your self. I would post
the URL but the site uses #$@! Frames.

The magnitude of the error is very small, thus very few people are
JUMPING UP AND DOWN claming the END of the world over this!

Gee Steve. Why don't you tell us how you really feel :-) I do not agree with 
Ben and auto dynamics but they do seem to be more on the ball than the 
traditional old fashion theories you spout ad naseaum. By the way, how are 
you coming on competing the incomplete Bohr atom model and adding a 
gravitational component and explaining how your theory violates universal law 
of like charges repel and yet remain taught today as a valid theory.

Examiners of new theories are of three minds. 1 Skeptic, 2. Objective, 3 Open 
minded.  I discard skeptics as they take the lazy position and will not take 
the burden of proof supporting their opinion, and I discard the open minded 
as the last person that wanted me to be open minded wanted to dance with my 
wife, seems many have the neurotic view to do as the Romans do. Objective 
examination required of new knowledge means that you own teachings are 
examined with the same diligence that the new knowledge is. That your beliefs 
are widely taught and published is not proof of validly. Take you own 
medicine and explain the gravitational anomaly observed.

Gee Steve. Why don't you tell us how you really feel :-) I do not agree with 
Ben and auto dynamics but they do seem to be more on the ball than the 
traditional old fashion theories you spout ad naseaum. By the way, how are 
you coming on competing the incomplete Bohr atom model and adding a 
gravitational component and explaining how your theory violates universal law 
of like charges repel and yet remain taught today as a valid theory. 

Examiners of new theories are of three minds. 1 Skeptic, 2. Objective, 3 Open 
minded. I discard skeptics as they take the lazy position and will not take 
the burden of proof supporting their opinion, and I discard the open minded 
as the last person that wanted me to be open minded wanted to dance with my 
wife, seems many have the neurotic view to do as the Romans do. Objective 
examination required of new knowledge means that you own teachings are 
examined with the same diligence that the new knowledge is. That your beliefs 
are widely taught and published is not proof of validly. Take you own 
medicine and explain the gravitational anomaly observed.

This "news" is getting to be two or three years old now, and yet it still
circulates. The solution was found a long time ago- IR photon pressure from
the RTG power supplies aboard all four probes causes the (extremely minute)
deltaV. After many years of flight, that minute deltaV becomes readily
detectable.

I'm very surprised this made it to the list. Now, what is this about
rewriting physics on four data points that are not readily reproducible?
Really now.

Well, I don't buy your idea without more details either.  If you claim
to be so familiar with autodynamics and that it explains the
discrepancy, why don't you just describe how?

It makes a lot more sense to me that the discrepancy results from an
overlooked known physical effect than that it's proof for an untested
and unconventional physical theory.

I would like to see a more detailed description of how the infrared
radiation from the RTGs on those probes would account for the velocity
discrepancy, but it's not a physically untenable explanation on the
surface.

I gave you the link,so the author can discribe it better than I can.
Since I can't READ the paper on the IR solution I wish not to comment
on it, other than the thrust if is from the RTG's should be getting smaller
as the RTG's cool.

A discrepancy in any theory is a sign that the theory needs revising.
So far all the theories I have read about gravity before Autodynamics
and gravity was a lot of hand waving and mumbo-jumbo. You can't point to
a object and say -- you cause gravity --.  Gravity is one subject
not very much R&D money is spent on today.

I say only 1 point is needed -- the point in space where the BIG BANG happened.

Anderson's original publication is in the Oct 5 98 Physical Review Letters.
Other physicists (like Katz of Washington University, St. Louis)
point out that radiation pressure from the RTGs on those craft are perfectly
adequate to account for the pressure (noted in S&T, Jan. 1999). Anderson
himself believes the error is internal to the spacecraft, and *not* a
problem with physics, pointing out that Earth and Mars do not display a
similar solar force but the relatively nearbly Ulysses spacecraft does,
therefore, whatever it is is specific to the spacecraft.

And no, Ben, there is no "url" you can go to to find the above, you'll just
have to use
a library.

The actual acceleration itself is constant at about 8.5exp-8 cm/s^2; the
very fact that it is constant is inconsistent with the increasing distance
to the Sun for Pioneer 10 and 11 between 1998 and the point it was first
detected in 1980 would indicate that it is not a force related to Sun, but
only a consequence of the spacecraft design, such as a constant radiation
pressure.

There may be other forms of acceleration or drag peculiar to the spacecraft
that are causing the error, but Kratz tends to think it was IR radiation
pressure and Occam's Razor is on his side. Nobody in the physics community
seems willing to suggest that it is anything but an anomaly restricted to
certain spacecraft.
Anderson himself admitted that he feels it has an internal cause in his
publication
in Physical Review.

As for Ben's commentary about RTG's getting cooler, the halflife of
Pu 238 is 87.75 years; it will not change that much over twenty years, the
greatest
delta being distance to the Sun.

Now, why aren't Voyager 1 and 2, as well as every planetary body in the
Solar System perturbed by the same "force" if it is a problem with physics?

The problem here is that nobody likes a mundane explanation, because a good
one destroys blind speculation. I've noticed that a few members  of the
Starship
Design list have recently commented that they prefer blind speculation and
don't like skeptics. Oh well.
