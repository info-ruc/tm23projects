I have just begun work with dmdx and am having a problem getting 
the following item file to work as I intend.

Below is a stripped down version of the item file.  I want to 
present an item on the screen for some long time period.  While 
the item is on the screen, I want to record *all* occurrences of 
some set of responses, and have the program to progress to the 
next item with out requiring an enter-key press.

At present, I can't get rid of the enter-key requirement and not 
all of the key presses end up in the data file (although they 
do appear in the job1.zil file). 

Can someone provide me with help or an example item?

It would be very helpful if an example of <rcot> could be 
slipped into the example....

   That's just plain zillion responses, <zil> in the parameter line.

   It's not a requirement, it's an optional extra that comes with <zek>, 
you don't want <zek>.

   Just stick it in the parameter line.

That is what I thought it should be but when I used only <zil> 
then the program hangs at line 101.  The screen times out 
correctly and is erased but the program never makes it to line 
102.

   For a start I can't guess at what an old version of DMDX is going to do, 
please use the latest release.  Second, you can't have _anything_ before 
the parameter line, if those comments are actually in the script all bets 
are off.  Although your use of <ztr 0> is superfluous I'm betting that your 
<ntl> is causing the hang, <zil> requires a time limit to determine when to 
stop taking responses but if you've turned off the time limit stuff with 
<ntl> of course it's never going to time out and thus move beyond gathering 
responses for item 101.

We're running version 1.05 and are trying to pull inputs from an 8-button
response box connected via a PIO12 board. Inputs on Bits 0, 1, and 2 read
fine, when specified as valid zillion keys, and I can map all three of
these to requests, positive, and negative responses. However, I cannot
read anything higher than Bit2. Bits 3 and higher register on the PIO12
test in TimeDX.

how important is it, one may ask? On the other hand, I have at some time
done a simple/dirty trick: Include sth. like "HtmL:PRE:" and
"HtmL:/PRE:" as text in my word doc.  A simple filter removes these
from the word file before
final creation of the help files, your clever filter uses these as hints
for translation to html. HtmL:IMAGE SRC="blah": should insert a picture

Tried this both in the parameter line and on an item line and no change.

   Yep, had that in there for a while but there were additional 
complications there as filter then needed to know it was processing /PRE 
data and to not emit /BR etc.

   Did that, however to _automate_ the process the filter would have to 
either take the inline windows metafile format or instead take the .BMP 
reference and turn either into something you can post on the web, say 
.PNG.  If you start to do a little research into .PNG's format you'll 
quickly find out it's another non-trivial format and would have taken more 
work than the .JPG format code I built recently (so I probably would have 
used .JPG but I didn't think of that back then).  Instead I just made the 
code emit .GIF references and the user (me) was made implicitly responsible 
for converting the .BMPs to .GIFs and putting them in the right 
location.  There are only 5 or so bitmaps in the new docs anyway so I live 
with it.

Happy New Year everybody,
and great fun using DMDx

I have tried using .zil instead of .azk

With <zil> I got
Item 1 631.65, +Bit2 918.27, -Bit2
Item 2 633.76, +Bit1 859.36, -Bit1
and so on
What is the effective RT ???

With <azk> I got (different experiement)
Item   RT
1        556.45
2        685.84

In order to compare I put both
<azk><zil> in the command line
Only .zil file has been updated

Is it possible to get both ?
Why .zil is generated and not .azk?
Do we have to choose only one ?

Thanks for reply
Cheers

   For item 1 Bit2 went active (ie, the button connected to Bit 2 of port A 
on the PIO12 was pressed) 631.65ms after the clockon.  It went inactive 
(was released) 918.27ms after the clockon.

   .zil is a superset of the .azk code.

   Yup.

Hi,

Just a couple of quick questions......

1) Is there anyway you can get DMDX to display ASCII text standard IBM
font?

2) Can you get DM to run itm files with more than 255 items?

These are both possible solutions to a problem I am currently having 
with a masked priming experiment consisting of 440 items, any help 
would be appreciated.

Many thanks
Em

Hi!!

Do you know if it is possible to do progressive demasking with dmdx (I =
think we should use conditionnal branching) ?
The sequence of items would be the following:
**** 400ms / dog 16ms / **** 384ms / dog 32 ms / **** 368ms / dog 48ms =
etc...
=20

When the subject hit a key we record the reaction time, then he has to =
type the name he saw.

Thanks in advance

512 items if you deliberately make it use the .DTP output format with

Thanks for you quick response......So if I wanted to display 440 items
in dm what do you need to specify on the first line for it to do that,
at the minute it says 'too many items' when you try to run it.  Also 
when I talk about standard IBM font I mean the basic dos style font 
not the times new roman or courier or whatever that you get when 
creating rtf files in a word.

Thanks again
Emma

   You can either do it with a large elaborate branching item file or you 
can use a couple of counters and set the frame's duration with <%ctr> and 
decrement one counter while incrementing the other.  If you want the thing 
subject controlled with a standard RT response you might be able to do it 
toggling between using <zor> and <ztr> and turning the time limit on and 
off with <ntl>, something like the following:

<zil> <nfb> F30 T4000
.
.
.
0 "press right shift if you recognize the word" <set 1 24> <set 2 1>
   <zek 0> <zor> <umpr> <umnr> <ntl 0>
   <mpr "right shift"> <mnr "left shift">;
+100 "****" <%ctr 1> / * <%ctr 2> "dog" / <bic 200> c;
0 "wrong" / <dec 1> <inc 2> <bicGT 1,0,-100>;
0 "ok, so you're not going to get that one";
200 <emit 1> <emit 2> "type the word you saw" <zor 0> <ztr> <ntl> *;
.
.
.

   There are going to be things I've overlooked in that example, I haven't 
tried to run it.

   The closest you are going to get is the System Fixed font (or whatever 
it's called).  You may be able to find the exact font on the web somewhere.

         You don't need to specify anything (other than the value of n). My 
guess is that DM thinks it has run out of memory.  This is probably due to 
code I wrote back in the 80's when we faced the 640K barrier.  The scramble 
routines attempt to read the entire file into memory, and by today's 
standards, a ridiculously small amount of memory was reserved for this.

         I infer that your interest in using DM and the DOS font means that 
you are planning an exact replication of some earlier experiment, where the 
physical properties of the font are critical.  Hence using the system font 
with DMDX (and using white letters on a black background) would not be a 
solution.

         Assuming this is correct, what can you do?  One thing would be to 
shorten the length of the item file.  Presumably, your items are fairly 
long.  If they involve repetitive material, a macro would be one way of 
shortening the file.  Another possibility is to avoid scrambling with DM, 
and arrange the items in a pseudo-random sequence ahead of time.  Finally, 
you could cut the item file into two halves, and run one file and then the 
other. This will lead to some messiness in the analysis of the dtp files, 
but it can be coped with.

Dear Jonathan,

I have a ATI rage 128 xpert 128(english)  video adapter, I am told it has
16mb of RAM. What do I need to get in order to upgrade so that I can run
DMDX ?

Regards,

Lawrence

   New drivers maybe, certainly 16MB is plenty for DMDX's 
purposes.  Perhaps the ATI is just brain dead, I certainly found that 
earlier ATI cards while having scads of RAM only allowed 50% of it to be 
used for DMDX's 2D purposes, the rest was only available as texture memory 
for 3D rendering.  We find the NVIDIA cards to be consistently good 
performers although I have trouble with the GeForce MX in my home machine, 
no doubt the next revision of the drivers for it will fix it, especially 
seeing as I bundled up DMDX and a demo item file demonstrating the error.

Greetings!

I hope that someone will be able to help me out. Essentially what I want to
do is present a self-paced sentence in zones, each appearing sequentially
(to the right) after a key press and staying on the screen until the subject
finishes the reading the complete sentence. I need to get a RT for each zone
(an overall one would be a bonus also)... an example sentence is as follows
(dashes separate zones):

- After the audience - had applauded - the actors - took a break.

Each zone would need to be on the screen until the whole sentence was read
(to allow possible backtracking), but not be 'disjointed' in terms of
sentence presentation.

Is this possible with DMDX? If so, would someone be able to tell me the code
for doing this? It would be greatly appreciated.

Warm Regards.

   You want the <ProgressiveX> keyword combined with the dreaded 
<ResponseContingent> MDSP bit.  Your item file needs to be something like 
the following:

<rc> F30
100 + <px .2> "After the audience" /
             ! + " had applauded" /
             ! + " the actors" /
             ! + " took a break";


   Best to look at Ken's DMTG and DM documentation on how RC is to be used:

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kforster/dmastr/dm_dmtg.htm

   Basically the example will stop after each frame and gather a response 
producing results for items 100, 101, 102 and 103.  Can't remember if a CR 
indicator needs to go before the item number and there's probably ten other 
things I'm not remembering either but DM or DMDX syntax should work in DMDX 
so check the old documentation.  Other interesting keywords to use in 
addition use would be <NoFeedback> or <FBOnlyClearBehind> if you do 
actually want feedback.

Thanks Jonathon. After a bit of searching and mucking around, I am pretty
sure I got DMDX to do what I needed (except for the 'total time' for each
sentence). If anyone is interested for future experiments the syntax looks
like this:

N3 <azk> <cr> <t 1000000>  <ID "PIO12"> <id keyboard> <dbc 100> <dwc
255255255> <nfb> <rc>

100 + <px .1>
		 ! + * "After the audience" /
             ! + * " had applauded" /
             ! + * " the actors" /
             ! + * " took a break";

0 "Press spacebar for next sentence" E;

200 + <px .1>
		! + * "The foreigner" E /
		! + * " told the joke" /
		! + * " didn't understand";

0 "Press spacebar for next sentence" E;

300 + <px .1>
		! + * "While the mother dressed" E/
		! + * " the baby" /
		! + * " played unsupervised";

0 LB "End of experiment";

Kind Regards,

Ben.

   Good going.  Not to be too picky but seeing as you posted this to the

required because you've got No Erase switches (!) where they shouldn't be, 
E is a last resort when something is broken, if an item file has to use

Is the following still the appropriate way to cite DMDX? 

"The experiment was run using the DMDX software developed at Monash
University and at the University of Arizona by K.I.Forster and J.C.Forster."

I checked the website and found nothing more recent than June of 2000 on
this topic, so assumed this to be correct.

Thanks much.

Thanks Jonathon. However, the script you gave me (for whatever reasons) I
can't seem to get to work properly. Firstly, after the first sentence is
complete, it won't move on to "Press spacebar...". Also, without the
clockon's, I have found that the saved data is 'one short' - instead of RT's
for 100, 101, 102, 103, I only get 100, 101, 102... not sure why... well,
actually, I am pretty sure it is because my skill with DMDX is pretty lame.

I'll keep trying. Cheers.

   Don't bother, if you've got it working and there are a few extraneous 
switches it doesn't matter, I was just posting for sake of technical 
correctness.  In any event the state of Response Contingency under DMDX is 
such that the clockon situation you describe is more than likely a hole in 
the code.  Because RC is a such a horrible kludge I am not thinking of it 
as I design new things for DMDX so it gets broken and then someone (like 
Wayne Murray) reminds me of it and I'm saying "oh, yeah, RC... I forgot, 
again, oops".  One day I'll write a <progressiveX> across items and make 
the mode no longer supported, I don't get around to it because no one is 
using word by word reading tasks around here.

True, but does it have to be a kludge (as I said elsewhere)?

> the mode no longer supported, 

Sounds good, provided it always gets the next item up in the 
minimum possible time after the response (some types of SP 
reading only seem to work if there is a very tight apparent coupling 
between the response and the next display) and it is possible to 
keep variable numbers of items together in a scramble - since this 
is often used with sentences of variable length across an expt.

Not quite true - or at least people there USED to want to do it!  It 
is, however, undoubtedly something that many many people would 
like to be able to use DMDX for.

   Ok, today I write the necessary keywords to do away with RC in a single 
item.  I'll leave existing RC as it stands but it will be legacy code, if 
someone has problems with it then they'll be told to use the new stuff 
coming in a few hours.

   So 2.3.05 addresses these long standing issues with Response Contingency 
with the addition of one simple keyword:

<ContinueProgressiveX>
<cpx>
<cp>

	This keyword is used for word by word sentence reading tasks replacing the 
need to use the Response Contingency keyword.  This keyword allows 
<ProgressiveX> to be used across items, where the first item uses <px> and 
following items that need to continue spacing where the previous item 
finished use <cpx>.  Both <px> and <cpx> only need be used once at the 
beginning of an item.

For example, the old form of word by word sentence reading would be:

1 <px .1> + "hickory " / - ! "dickory " / + ! "dock " / + ! "the " / + ! 
"mouse " / + ! "ran "/ + ! "up "/ + ! "the " / + ! "clock";

	This would produce responses for items 1 to 9.  The new form, while more 
expansive sticks to standard constructs and explicitly shows which frame 
produces which RT:

+1 <px .1> * "hickory ";
-2 <cpx> * !         "dickory ";
+3 <cpx> * !                 "dock ";
+4 <cpx> * !                      "the ";
+5 <cpx> * !                          "mouse ";
+6 <cpx> * !                                "ran ";
+7 <cpx> * !                                    "up ";
+8 <cpx> * !                                       "the";
+9 <cpx> * !                                           "clock";

	Other keywords that are likely to be used in conjunction with <px> and 
<cpx> are <Delay 0>, <ContinuousRun> and <NoFeedback>.

   And of course the other reason for RC's existence that I keep forgetting 
about is scrambling, notably that in sentences one typically has a variable 
number of words and that makes scrambling difficult.  Currently should 
someone want to use the new <cpx> and want to scramble their items they 
will have to determine the longest single sentence that they wish to 
present, set G to that number and then pad all shorter sentences with dummy 
items, typically !; sequences will do.

   To alleviate this I will see if I can implement a new scrambling 
feature, the <VariableGroup> (it's tentative because I didn't write 
Scramble's code and it's messy [which is being polite] and any changes to 
it stand a significant chance of breaking it completely).  Here you will 
specify a divisor and items that are consecutive and whose item numbers 
divided by <vg>'s value are the same will be considered part of the same group.

   Well, I've been banging on the mods I've made to Scramble and as far as 
I can tell they're solid so I'm releasing 2.4.00.  Only one new keyword but 
it's a doozy:

Variable Grouping Keyword

<VariableGrouping N>
<vg N>

	Scramble parameter that enables variable group sizes.  Cannot occur in 
extended parameters, all scramble parameters must still occur on the first 
line.  For information on traditional scrambling see Scrambling.  N 
specifies a divisor, items that are consecutive and that have identical 
item numbers when divided by N are considered to be in the same group.

When determining the block size, the value for the S parameter, as with the 
traditional grouping parameter, is in numbers of groups.

	It is important to note that variable grouping completely ignores fixed 
blocks (the contents of the item file between $ symbols), any item numbers 
occurring there are ignored for the purposes of determining whether the two 
items surrounding the fixed block are part of the same variable 
group.  Which brings up a difference between the way the traditional G 
parameter and <vg> work, and that is their treatment of a fixed block when 
occurs in the middle of a group -- which is a rather tenuous thing to do in 
the first place.  Traditional grouping will move that fixed block to the 
end of the group, variable grouping will move it to the start of the group.

	For example:

s1 <vg 100>

$0 "variable grouping" , <ln 2> "Hit SpaceBar to Continue";$

101 "101";
102 "102";
103 "103";
104 "104";
105 "105";
$0 "within group";$
106 "106";
107 "107";
108 "108";
109 "109";

201 "201";
202 "202";
203 "203";

$0 "inter group";$

301 "301";
302 "302";
303 "303";
304 "304";
305 "305";
306 "306";

$0 "end"l;$

	Can produce the following when scrambled:

s1 <vg 100>

0 "variable grouping" , <ln 2> "Hit SpaceBar to Continue";

0 "within group";

301 "301";
302 "302";
303 "303";
304 "304";
305 "305";
306 "306";

201 "201";
202 "202";
203 "203";

0 "inter group";

101 "101";
102 "102";
103 "103";
104 "104";
105 "105";
106 "106";
107 "107";
108 "108";
109 "109";

0 "end"l;

   Well, the online help will be down until Monday, either psy1 has had 
it's FTP daemon hacked by someone and it can all of a sudden no longer 
handle long files names or CCIT has suddenly implemented some incredible 
anti hacking stuff and is somehow limiting file name length or the unknown 
has reared it's ugly head because there's no way I can transfer those files 
short of doing it one at a time, and guess, what, I'm not about to.

   Well, I got the online help stuff up there, finally remembered an 
alternate route I could take through two other machines that got the files 
there.  Mystery to me why it fails going directly there though.

   And while I had the scramble code torn apart I noticed that I could make 
scramble know about <ep> and </ep> so it's parameters could occur after the 
first physical line of the item file and while playing golf this morning 
(in the rain of all things, pretty rare in Tucson) I realized I could make 
it no longer need $ to stop the extended parameters from being scrambled 
without breaking older item files that already had $ in the parameters -- 
so I did them both today and released 2.4.01.

Re:  DMDX Listserv postings not accepted.

	Some users are having their postings rejected by the DMDX Listserv because 
their email address does not match the address used when they originally 
subscribed.  This seems to happen even though the user has not changed 
their account.

	This is probably due to some change in policy in your local computer 
center.  The problem could be solved by re-subscribing with the new address 
(provided that this will be a permanent change), and letting me know so 
that we can remove the old entry.  But if this is something that can vary 
from day to day, depending on which computer you use, then the problem is 
harder to fix.  You could ask your local CC why your address keeps changing.

   And of course with a new scramble parameter <vg> we have to have a 
multi-scrambling version of it, <msvg> and seeing as we've made scramble 
aware of extended parameter lines we'd better make the multi-scramble code 
aware of it too -- of course that entailed an almost complete re-write of 
the multi-scramble code...  At the end of the day when all is said and done 
it looks like I've got things back together again in a significantly more 
robust and flexible form that allows scramble and multi-scramble parameters 
to occur in the extended parameter line, that no longer requires the 
extended parameter line to be marked as a fixed block to scramble with $ 
symbols but can in fact still deal with old item files that have the 
extended parameter line marked as fixed.  Not to mention the new <msvg> 
multi-scramble variable length group parameters.

   BTW, apologies to anyone who actually tried to download 2.4.00 or 2.4.01 
and couldn't find it, it looks like the machine at home likes storing the 
file DMDX.ZIP on the server, quite distinct from the old archive dmdx.zip 
unix being what it is.  Now there's just one ;)

   It means it could not open diagnostics.txt.  The usual explanation for 
this  is that there is another copy of DMDX running and is therefore 
writing to diagnostics.txt so the current copy you are looking at can't 
open it, however there is code in the later versions that should stop two 
instances of DMDX running on the same machine.  I only see the message 
because I have two systems running DMDX out of the same directory in the 
development setup.  I guess if you had a word processor (like word) 
currently editing diagnostics.txt you'd get the error, the only other ways 
would be things like the disk being full or other catastrophic 
errors.  That or you are using an old version of DMDX and have another 
instance running of it already.  DMDX will continue to run perfectly well 
if it can't open diagnostics.txt, you just won't have any diagnostics when 
you're done -- it won't run so well if there's another copy of it already 
running.

Hi:
I'm new to DMDX and am designing my first experiment.
I would like to do a self-paced reading task, with one sentence per frame,
where each item has 1-2 sentences followed by a verification sentence. E.g:

Doris asked out Sue's boyfriend.
Sue was really upset about it.
DORIS ASKED OUT SUE'S BOYFRIEND

I would like the subject to read the first sentence, press Space when they
have read and understood it, read the next sentence, press Space, read the
verification sentence and press Right or Left Shift, and then Space again
to bring up the next item. From what I gather, the Space bar only works to
request a following ITEM, not a following FRAME within an item.
One possibility that I have considered and tried is to have each frame be
its own item. But then I have problems with scrambling, as each sentence is
scrambled separately - verifcation sentences appear separated from the rest
of the item. I can't use the 'group' parameter to ensure that sentences
belonging to one 'item' appear together, because the number of sentences
per item varies (2 or 3, including verification sentence). Also, I do not
want subjects to have to respond to non-target sentences use the Shift keys
because I don't want to bias them to one SHift key over the other. That
is, what I really want is for them to only use the Shift keys to respond to
a verification sentence, and the Space bar for everything else.

Also, what is azk? How do I know whether I want azk or dtp as output files?
Is there any current documentation on how to save data from subjects or is
the Dmastr manual the only source of info?

Thanks in advance.

   Guess you can't have been subscribed for too long, I just added the 
<VariableGrouping> keyword over the weekend.  You'll want the latest 
version of the code and an item file something like the following:

s1 <vg 10>
100 "Doris asked out Sue's boyfriend.";
100 "Sue was really upset about it.";
+101 "DORIS ASKED OUT SUE'S BOYFRIEND" *;
110 "next sentence.";
+111 "probe" *;

>Also, what is azk?

   Ascii data files.

>  How do I know whether I want azk or dtp as output files?

   You want azk.

>Is there any current documentation on how to save data from subjects or is
>the Dmastr manual the only source of info?

   Some of the other web sites might have information, I haven't looked at 
them.

         The dtp output file is a binary file listing RTs for up to 512 
items, sorted by item number.  You have to use our somewhat dated Fortran 
programs (DATMAK, UPDATE, CONCAT) to do anything with the data.  See the 
DMASTR manual for details.

         The azk file is a txt file that lists RTs to items in the order 
they were presented, and has no limits on the number of items.  To use 
DMDX's variable grouping feature you'd need item numbers greater than 512, 
so this is the option you should use.  Data analysis is carried out via 
spreadsheet, e.g., Excel.

It sounds to me like you've got too old a version of DirectX installed. You
can download a newer version (version 6 or later is recommended) from
Microsoft or from here:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/directx/

These errors could also arise if you are using windows NT. AFAIK dmdx will
never work with windows NT v4, though it works fine with w95/w98 and
apparently works ok with w2k (though I've not tried this).

Bruce Blaine,

         The latest versions of DMDX require DirectX 7.0.  Unless yours is 
a very recent machine, it is likely that it has V 5.0.  You can download 
the latest version from Jonathan's DMDX Updates page.  All you need to do 
is click on the downloaded EXE file and it will install itself.  If this 
doesn't work, let me know.

Greetings!

Just a brief query. If I wanted to get a subject's confidence rating for a
particular response, how would I script this?

For example:

+1 * "The frog jumped"; 
+2 * "Did the frog jump?";

"Rate the confidence of your answer on a scale of 1 - 5"

I have checked the help files as well as various scripts on the internet,
but I haven't (as yet) been able to find an example of this. Is it possible
with DMDX? Can you get that form of output?

Looking forward to a response,

Benjamin.

   Yes, see <ZillionOneResponse>.  You'll be mapping keys all over the 
place but you can either use macro's or better yet the new <call> keyword 
and have one subroutine to map keys and turn feedback on to gather RTs and 
then another routine to turn feedback off and map keys for a rating.

   Well, I just spent all evening wrestling the new NVIDIA 650 drivers onto 
my machine in the vain hope that the version of DMDX I'd sent to them had 
had some effect -- bzzzt.  Guess I should know better, they're big biz 
now.  Shame really, because one side effect of the evening's swearing has 
been to correctly identify my monitor to win32 as a result I get video 
modes like 640 x 480 x 8 at 150Hz or 1024 x 768 x 16 at 100Hz, this in a 
$120 video card.  If you plan on using the GeForce MX you'll have to either 
use 1024 x 768 x 16 or some other video made that makes DMDX use less than 
24 buffers or perhaps the -buffers command line parameter can be used to 
limit the number of buffers and thus stop DMDX from locking the machine up 
(and I do mean locking, I've never seen anything lock a machine up that hard).

   Just got an interesting reply from NVIDIA about the GeForce MX lockup 
DMDX induces.  Turns out that the lockup is likely to occur on all GeForce 
video cards as the long flipping chains DMDX creates are using up hardware 
resources on the card, all previous video cards used RAM resources to 
create flipping chains and were essentially unlimited.  Seeing as most of 
these GeForce cards are way beyond what you need for DMDX (in both 
performance and price) not many people are likely to care although the 
GeForce MX is a  really sweet card for $110.  However, it's is NVIDIA's 
chipset which means that eventually _all_ of their hardware will be based 
on it and because NVIDIA are the power in video cards right now it's 
certain people will be using the GeForce chipset with DMDX at some time in 
the future.  Sounds like NVIDIA have got better things to do that to fix a 
problem in their drivers that only a small number of scientists are ever 
going to encounter so the remedy is to run DMDX with a shortcut like this:

C:\DmDX\dmdx.exe -buffers 4

   It's probably not going to be as good as TNT1 or TNT2 because that's a 
pitifully small number of buffers but the day may come when you have no 
choice.  Hopefully by the time NVIDIA will have fixed their drivers but it 
sounds like a pretty major thing to fix so I'm not holding my 
breath.  Oddly enough 1024x768x16 works without the override and it is 
using something like 21 buffers.

Hello DMDX users.  I am working on a problems, and perhaps someone can help
me with it.

I would like to show a series of images to my participants and record how
long they view each one.  I have written some script that will allow the
participant to move from one image to another, but I don't know how to
record and output the viewing times.  Does anyone have any ideas for me?

In addition, I would like to present the Self-Assessment-Manikin (SAM) on
the computer.  I know there is a computer version of this instrument written
for VPM, but I am hoping to put together something with DMDX.  The SAM
consists of a series of pictures.  Participants chooses among them to report
their level of arousal and their emotional valence.  Has anyone tried to do
something like this before.

I appreciate any help you can offer.  Thanks.

   Use an item that gathers a response and that leaves the last image on 
the display, when they respond the display will be cleared so the RT will 
be the image duration.  If you're not interested in right / wrong 
measurements use <clfb>.

I think that there are some options with this.  The paper version of the
measure shows all the images on one page [Each is a square-ish human figure
with an expression that corresponds to a different level of arousal or
emotional valence] and the participants mark their responses.  It seems like
I could put a bitmap made from a scanned page up on the screen, and the
participants could indicate their responses with the keyboard.  The computer
version shows one image on the screen and allows the particants to cyle
through the range of responses before selecting the one that suits them
best.  It seems like I could show one image at a time and have the subjects
use the keyboard to view each one before making a response.

Does that explanation help?

Thanks again.  I really appreciate the help.

   Yeah, those pictures are used in one of the clinical labs.  Either 
option is possible in DMDX.  The easiest solution is to use spatial 
separation with a big old bitmap using <ZillionOneResponse> to gather a one 
key rating.  This has the down side of the whole item file now needing to 
use zillion responses instead of RTs, but careful use of <zor> can gather 
RTs too.  You'll also be mapping and unmapping keys as you switch from RT 
to rating, see the help on <zor>.  Timewise separation is trickier but 
possible (and perhaps a little more elegant) what with the wiz bang things 
I've added to DMDX in the last few months.  Basically you'd set up a 
subroutine that presented each of the images and gathering a response, on a 
positive response the routine would return with a counter set to indicate 
the rating, otherwise on a negative response it would move to the next 
image or repeat the cycle if the end was reached.  Something like:

0 "Self-Assessment-Manikin" <bu 1000>;
+100 <set 1,1> <bmp> "most unhappy" * <bic 200>;
+101 <inc 1> <bmp> "next to most unhappy" * <bic 200>;
+102 <inc 1> <bmp> "next to next to most unhappy" * <bic 200>;
...
+112 <inc 1> <bmp> "happiest" * <biw 100> <!note that one's biW, not biC>;
200 d0 %0 c <return>;

+1000 <bmp> "image" * <call 100>;
1000 d0 %0 c <emit 1>;

+1001 <bmp> "next image" * <call 100>;
1001 d0 %0 c <emit 1>;
...

Hi
Thanks for the help - good timing re. the <vg> parameter!
I set vg to '1' so I could keep my item numbering the same - also I
numbered the target sentence the same as the others for that item - I
couldn't figure out why you added 1 in your example...? Anyway, it works
like a charm. I did have to download DirectX 8, however, as the latest
version of DMDX requires it.

Thanks again.

   Convention, I like to keep item numbers that gather responses separate 
from ones that don't.  I also didn't want to give an example of the unusual 
<vg 1> condition, but you're smart and figured it out so all's well.

   Probably requires version 7 although 8 certainly shouldn't hurt.

Dear list,

I would like to set up an experiment where letters of a 
word are presented one at a time, each one disappearing 
with the presentation of the next and the letters appearing 
in the same positions as they would if the whole word were 
presented.  The presentation is paced by the subject 
requesting the next letter in the sequence by a key press. 
A beep is presented with the final letter, and subjects are 
asked to name the word when they hear the beep.  I would 
like to measure how long they spend viewing each letter and 
the time they take to name the word after the presentation 
of the final letter (or alternatively how long they take 
from the first letter until they name the word - I could 
still calculate the average time per letter).  

I have been using the Continue Progressive X keyword.  My 
difficulty is that this requires both button press and 
voice key input within the same experiment.  Including the 
RecordVocal input at the beginning of the file disables the 
button press responses.  I have managed to use just 
DigitalVOX as input, unmapping it for all the letters in 
the word except the last one.  However, since the beep is 
presented concurrently with the last letter, the voice key 
is triggered by the beep rather than by the subject's 
response (my beep lasts 100 msec, so it should be completed 
before the onset of their response, but I don't want to 
delay timing by making it a separate item - I want to see 
how fast my subjects can read these words).  If I had the 
RecordVocal files then I could obtain the naming latencies 
afterwards (time consuming, but not too bad if I use small 
numbers of subjects).  

Is there a way of switching RecordVocal on and off during a 
single experiment?  If not, then is there another way I can 
go about doing this (using zillion responses maybe)?  

Finally, I have also tried to remap positive responses to 
the space bar for all letters except the last one, so that 
subjects advance by pressing the space bar rather than a 
shift key, but for some reason that command hasn't worked 
here, even though it worked in another file - could it be a 
bug?  Remapping to a letter works fine.  At the moment this 
file only works by pressing negative response q to advance. 

Here is my item file so far:

Any hints would be appreciated.

   There is no way to get around the beep triggering the DigitalVOX beyond 
making sure that the beep is finished playing by the time the frame with 
the clockon in it is displayed.  Physically what you want is impossible let 
alone any constraints imposed by DMDX's limitations.

   No way to turn a device on or off unfortunately, other than mapping and 
un mapping the DigitalVox's signal.  You might try displaying the last 
frame without a clockon (it doesn't matter where in an item the <mpr 
+DigitalVOX> occurs, the mapping is done as the item is parsed before the 
display commences) for however many ticks corresponds to the beep length 
and displaying a frame that doesn't erase the display but contains the 
clockon.  Essentially you'll be turning the clock on around 100ms late so 
you'll have to add that time to the RTs in your analysis but you just plain 
can't be recording and playing sounds without the recording containing what 
you are playing.

   You probably need to use <UnMapRequest> and <MapRequest> as well, the 
space bar is mapped to it by default.

I've just piloted an experiment and want o make sure
I'm reading the .azk file on reaction time appropriately.

>From the following example:

 Subject 12, 02/07/2001 14:30:09 on OEMComputer, refresh 13.21ms
  Item      RT

   250 -4000.00

   250 -4000.00

   250  1025.15

   250  1166.01

1) Are the reaction times reported measured in milliseconds?

2)  Is the negative sign an indication of an "incorrect" response

on the part of the subject?

3) Why does "-4000.00" appear to be a limit?  I have no reaction

times reported larger than that.=20

Thank you for help!

Hi

I am conducting a picture naming experiment in which the background
colour behind the picture is crucial. This is no problem using lines
like

+1 <ms% 600> <bgc 255000000> / * <bmp> fish / <bgc 0> <ms% 100> /;

except that I don't know how to scramble just one element of the line.
The sequence of background colours needs to be fixed, but I want the
pictures to appear in a random order. Any suggestions?

More details about how to use the new scrambling and multi-scrambling
options in 2.4.02 would be great too.

Many thanks

Rachel Bond

   You'll have to use <DefaultBackgroundColor>, you can't scramble within 
an item.  Something like:

$0 d0 %0 ! c <dbgc 255000000> ;$
+ 1 <ms% 600> / * <bmp> "fish" / <dbgc 0> <bgc 0> <ms% 100> /;
$0 d0 %0 ! c <dbgc 000255000> ;$
+2 <ms% 600> / * <bmp> "cat" / <dbgc 0> <bgc 0> <ms% 100> /;

>More details about how to use the new scrambling and multi-scrambling

   If there's more help on those someone else will have to write it, I'm 
not.  Especially the multi-scrambling, gods that hurt figuring that much out.

I'm trying to install TimeDX and DMDX but am encountering some difficulty.
I can open TimeDX, but am unable to open any dialog boxes to run tests.
For example, clicking on 'Select Video Mode' causes the screen to change
from blue to grey and the words 'Video Modes Test' to appear at the top of
the window, but no dialog box or other location to choose a video mode
appears.  All of the other tests yield similar results except for 'Time
Video Mode', which causes the words 'Refresh Rate <>' to flicker briefly on
the screen and then the words 'Vertical Retrace Sync Test' to appear at the
top of the window.  

I am using a Pentium III with 392Mb of RAM running Windows 2000.  The video
card is an ATI Xpert2000.  

Thanks for any help!

   A quick test here confirms your results, win2k is no longer 
usable.  Either use the legacy 1.3 version of DMDX or dual boot to 
98.  Something in my lovely new dialog code isn't working under w2k, I'll 
see if I can figure out what it is.

Hi:
I'm having trouble using Word 2000 with the latest version of DMDX. If I
use Word 97, it's fine, but with WOrd 2000, when I try to run an item file
Syntax Check, it stops at every line. The message I get is regarding
unrecognized switch characters - and will refer to a sequence in the middle
of a word in the middle of an item!! Again, though, when I use Word 97,
it's fine.
Is there a general problem using Word 2000 with the latest version of DMDX?
(i.e., the one updated at the end of January?).

   I've tracked down the win2k problem mentioned earlier.  I can release an 
interim version with kludge, you'll just get an error message every time a 
new dialog is activated under win2k.  Or you can wait till I find out why a 
perfectly innocent function is failing.

I would love to have the interim version.  An error message shouldn't
disturb me much.

   Not to worry, I found it.  The code was using a device context that it 
had released and win9x being the piece of junk it is was letting me get 
away with it, w2k OTOH is much more rigorous.  Problem is rectified in 
TimeDX 2.1.02 and DMDX 2.4.04 now on the web page.

         Judging from the experience Ram Frost had using Word 2000 to 
display Hebrew words with DMDX, it seems that this program likes to break 
an occasional word up into two segments (perhaps because of the way it 
handles buffers?), and then joins them together again.

         This had bad consequences, because the order of the letters in 
each individual segment were reversed, rather than the whole word.  Ram 
solved this problem by preparing the .rtf files in Word 2000 (which was a 
huge advantage, since the cursor moves from right to left, etc), and then 
opening and saving them in Word 8.0.

         So, for the time being at least, the best you can do is to check 
the "Ignore unknown RTF" box in DMDX.

This posting from Anna W at <anna@maccs.mq.edu.au >.
(Anna, how come this was an unauthorized posting?)

Dear DMDXers,
Just in case it is useful to anyone, I thought I should let you all
know that editing and saving one's .rtf files in WordPad (w98 version) 
seems to
get around the unrecognised switch (and various other) problems one has with
Word 2000. I'm not sure if this applies to the w2k version of WordPad too, but
it's worth a go if you are having problems with Word 2000.
Regards,
Anna W.

P.S. If you read an .rtf file originally created in Word into WordPad, I think
that it may bring a number of unknown control words with it. If this occurs,
saving the .rtf as a .txt file in WordPad, then opening it again in WordPad 
and saving it as an .rtf file eliminates all unknown control words.

Hello,

I would like to display two or three images on the same screen and then

We're setting up an experiment involving presentation of a single image as
a cue for multiple retrievals. We'd like to have subjects type individual
items and (if possible) time-stamp the completion of each item (e.g., on
the press of the enter key). If anyone has experience with something like
this, we'd appreciate suggestions. Thanks, -Michael

Subject: [DMDX] DMDX in the holy land

Dear DMDX users,

Being a silent reader of the DMD-X files, but following Ken Forster's
suggestion I would like to report a major problem we encountered in my new
lab while trying to make DMDX run experiments in Hebrew and Arabic.
My lab was recently equipped with the newest IBM machines, newest
graphic-cards, As well as Windows 2000 NT Professional. It was time to
move on and install DMDX rather than the old DMTG. Very quickly we
realized that TIMEDX cannot work with Windows 2000 NT, so we partitioned
our disk to have two options, WINDOWS 98 and WINDOWS 2000. DMDX was to be
run on WINDOWS 98. We also realized that the newest graphic card is in
high probability a problem. TIMEDX Does not work with all of them, better
buy an oldie. So we did. Finally the system worked.

Running experiments in Hebrew, however, created a problem that occupied my
lab for 3 long months. The item files were created using Office 2000,
first via Microsoft Excel, then via Microsoft Word files saved in RTF.
Note that since the Unicode System, which is the great feature of the new
Windows 2000 NT, cannot be used with DMDX, one needs to use a Hebrew (or
Arabic) enabled 98 or Millenium system. Microsoft Offices in Hebrew or
Arabic need to deal with the problem of how to set reading directions in a
text, which may involve mixing Hebrew and English script (Hebrew, as most
of you probably know, is printed from right to left). Office then needs
to switch the typing direction each time a Hebrew or an English Character
is encountered.. This is the major feature of any OFFICE for Hebrew.

While we printed the item files for DMDX, they looked fine on the screen.
However, when DMDX took the files, and actually ran the experiment we
discovered that for some items the words were typed on the screen during
the experiment with intermixed letters. That is, the second half of the
word appeared in the beginning, the last letter appears as first letter,
the last two letters appear as first two letters etc.

We further discovered that when such a problem occured for a given
stimulus, it was ALWAYS present for that stimulus in the experiment, in
any given run. This means it was NOT a random problem. We suspected that
this has to do with the interface of how DMDX operates with the Office
Hebrew/English programs . We could not find how or why a specific printed
stimulus will elicit this form of mixed presentation, as the printed file
looked always perfect. Only while running the experiment that we
discovered which stimulus got distorted. On the average, problems with
distorted stimuli occured for about 20 % of the trials. The alarming
problem was that the mixing was never transparent. The experiment
diagnostics printed in the DMDX window or saved in the experiment summary,
did NOT show that the word was printed wrongly. Only while running the
experiment that you could see that the word was distorted on the screen,
if you set the primes and targets to appear for long durations. This
was alarming because with masked priming one may not know that his/her
primes are printed wrongly.

Since the original files were not distorted, we struggled how to correct
them. While we tried to "correct" the printed word we could not correct it
by simply retyping the word. What we did was to enter the Excel file in
which we inetrleaved the items, and we recopied the entire line containing
that word into the RTF file. When we did that, the stimulus was often
repaired (again, once a stimulus was "repaired" it was always OK from that
point on). However, when we did that, we found out to our great horror and
distress that other stimuli not adjacent to that line may become
distorted. We tested this dozens of times but could not find a regularity
that predicts which items will be distorted. So, when we corrected the new
problems in the file, they were always OK from that point on.. But now
again, new items became distorted. These items were not distorted
previously, but became distorted as a result of the recopying of a line in
the file, which could be 10 or 30 lines before or after the correction.
Sounds horibble..I know...The only good news in this nightmare is that
eventually, after many runs, the words were all ok. So the process was not
endless, but eventually ended. However, the time it took to set an
experiment becames now 10 times as long. In fact, ANY change in the RTF
file, like changing the first line and typing N105 instead of N96 (the
parameter for n of stimuli) could have caused one or of the stimuli (or
more) in the list to be distorted. Even the wording of the instructions
for the subject could become distorted so the last word would be printed
in the beginning etc.

When be brought this to the attention of Ken and Jonathan they came with
The following explanation : " If Word breaks a letter sequence up into
segments, as it apparently does on occasion, then you might have something
like {AB} {CD} {EF}. If the font information is duplicated for each
segment, then it prints the first segment right to left, then the second
segment, etc., producing BADCFE instead of FEDCBA. If the font
information is not always duplicated, then other patterns are possible.
It is even possible that the segments are hierarchically arranged, as in
{{{AB}{CD}}{EF}}. We think that something like this must be occuring...
If you look at your .rtf file using a text editor (not Word), then you'll
see lots of extraneous markers, e.g.: "\rtlch" which are instructions
about how the text is to be printed/displayed. This particular example
specifies that what follows should be printed right to left. All the .rtf
instructions are preceded by a backslash and terminated by a space. What
we expect to find is that the words that are not displayed correctly will
have a different structure from all the others. Whenever you edit an .rtf
file and a new version gets written to disk, there is a chance that this
bug (if that is what it is) will zap one of the items. That's why just
changing the parameter line can mess the file up ".

So we checked this explanation, and printed the RTF file using a text
editor. Ken's intuition was correct. When we opened the RTF file in the
text format, we found indeed that for some stimuli, Office indeed broke
the sequence of the word. THIS WAS PRIOR TO DMDX OPERATION. So when DMDX
got this RTF file it printed first the last segment then the first
segment, instead of the other way around. our diagnosis is that the
problem is not with the Interaction of DMDX with WORD, but with
the interaction of WINDOWS and WORD. DMDX produces two files when it runs
the experiment. the first is called RTFPARSED, the second is called
SCRAMBLED. In both of those the initial error appears but this is because
it was already there in the RTF file we created.

WHY exactly, and for what reason the RTF file (or the text file) cuts the
word in two ? The only explanation we had was that it has to do
with some memory block size constraints characteristics to the software.
Our attempts to verify this with Microsoft Help desk were not successful.
They did acknowledge that their software does that, but declined
responsibility for "nonconvetional" use of their RTF files by
another software like DMDX. According to them they are only responsible
for mismatches between the keyboard typing and the page...
Our breakthrough in this problem was when de discovered that while OFFICE
2000 created files with about 20 % of distortion, OFFICE 97 created about
5% of distortions. We then thought that all this has to do with the very
fancy options that OFFICE 2000 has in typing, which obviously need to be
encoded somewhat in the RFT file. OFFICE 97 needs less memory and is less
complex, so less breaking is expected. Our solution was then to install
WORD 6.0. Each item file was first created using OFFICE 2000 or 97, but
when we were satisfied with its shape, before running the experiment, we
opened and saved the RTF file using WORD 6.0 . Only this file was fed
to DMDX. From that on never we encountered any mixing.

Most users of DMDX may not find this account necessarily relevant (as far
as we know only we are running Experiments in Hebrew), but they should be
aware that:
1) For any system that has Right-to-left and left-to-right typing
directions ; these problems may occur.
2) The RTF file may me distorted if you do not type simple Roman
stimuli.
3) The DMDX summary window will not reveal it.
4) In this case it is probably safer to use older versions of Word
like WORD 6.0 and save the final RTF file using this old version.
The new OFFICES 2000 may hide problem.

Hi.  After much foul language and swearing we solved our problems with
using Arabic and DMDX (see
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language/DMDX/dmdx_arabiyya.html), however
this was with Win98 not 2000.  I shall see if this system still works with
Win2000, that is whether we get the same problems as Ram and colleagues are
having with Hebrew.  I seriously hope not, Sami learnt more than enough
English swear words last time and I think before I learn any more Arabic
swear words, I should learn how to say hello, order a cup of tea etc.

I am testing Chinese on my Window 98. So far so good. The only extra
thing to do is to have a Chinese viewer open (I use njwin). I type
Chinese characters using a Chinese word processor "njstar". Then I copy
and paste them to Word which automatically swithces to MS Sun font.
Everything works well from there.

Jonathan -- do you know whether the Keithly PCI digital I/O boards
(specifically, the KPCI-PIO24) cards will work with the PIO12 calls from
DMDX? If one wants to do digital I/O, are you restricted to machines with
ISA slots (for the PIO-12 and -24)? Thanks, -Michael

   I suspect one or two people have these cards and I haven't heard of 
anything negative, nor can I think of a reason they wouldn't work.

We've had problems installing the Keithley PCI cards on some machines and
found the Computerboards clone a lot easier to use.

I need to buy a laptop to run DMDX and was wondering if anyone has bought
something this year that suits.  The nice MARCS people suggested a Dell
Inspiron, but the Dell people say a Latitude model, and our computer guy
says don't buy a Dell at all and get a Toshiba.

Thanks for your help,
Rebecca

Dear Rebecca,

> the inspiron or the latitude?
> 
> Thanks
> Rebecca

I've run an older version of DMDX on an Inspiron 3000 (no longer available - not 
sure what model they're up to now), and more recently on a Latitude (sorry - I 
don't have the model number handy).  So I'd say you could use either, but it's 
always a bit of a lottery with everything changing so fast.

Good luck!
Anna W.

Hi Folks,

> the inspiron or the latitude?

I've got a Dell Latitude CPx H500 on which I run DMDX. I've experienced
several problems with the computer - most notable is that the sound card (an
ESS Maestro) is really quite appalling. The Win98 drivers for the Maestro
are hopelessly out-of-date, when I try to record I often get divide errors
that Dell are unable to fix and I occasionally get white noise emitted from
the speakers instead of sound. This is all turning a blind eye to the fact
that in the three months that I've owned this computer I've had an engineer
out three times due to different bits snapping or malfunctioning in one way
or another...

Even the Dell engineer said that Inspirons are better made than Latitudes...

Hope that helps!
Stuart.

   Inspriron.  You basically want to buy as good a laptop as possible in 
the vain hope that it'll have half way decent hardware in it compared to a 
cheap desktop PC.

When I run the same expriment on 4 different computers, how do I put the
data together? Do I have to do it manually or is there anything like
"download" in dm that automatically collapse data into a single dtp
file? assistance appreciated.

I would use Matt Davis's getdat program.  It creates files that will open
in Excel and so you can easily stick the data together.

         I assume you must be using the .azk output option.  If you specify 
<dtp> on the parameter line of your .rtf file, you'll get DM-type .dtp 
files, and you can then use the DOS program UNLOAD.EXE just as you did before.

         But if you have .azk files as output, you don't have a comparable 
program that will append the .azk files to a common file on another drive 
(either a floppy or a network drive).  This is a gaping hole in our 
software, which Jonathan would say is very trivial.  A DOS batch file using 
the APPEND option would do the trick, but a Windows version would be 
nicer.  We will fix this soon.  For the time being, what I do is convert 
the .azk file to a .dtp file using AZK2DTP.EXE, and then proceed in DM 
mode.  This is fine, just so long as you don't have any item number greater 
than 512.

         One thing to watch.  If you do this, remember to rename your .azk 
files if you are going to run more subjects.  Otherwise you'll include the 
subjects twice.

I need to buy a laptop to run DMDX and was wondering if anyone has bought
something this year that suits.  The nice MARCS people suggested a Dell
Inspiron, but the Dell people say a Latitude model, and our computer guy
says don't buy a Dell at all and get a Toshiba.

Hi there

I'm trying to install DMDX on a Windows 95 machine.  When I try to run
TimeDX or DMDX, I get the following error message:

"A required .DLL file, DINPUT.DLL, was not found."

Any suggestions?

Thanks!

   One that matches your sound card's input impedance.  This is really 
quite tricky, unless you're a technician and understand input impedance 
about the only way to ascertain what is best is to get one of each type

You can also purchase a low impedance microphone and then add an impedance 
adaptor if necessary.  The disadvantage to this is that the most common 
adaptors are male cannon plug to 1/4 phone jack... most sound cards, with 
the exception of the Soundblaster Live Platinum with Live Drive (excellent 
card, BTW... very clean, very good signal/noise ratio, and excellent 
latencies with no appreciable variability), which has a 1/4 microphone in 
the front.

You used to be able to purchase microphone impedance adaptors at Radio 
Shack.  If I am not mistaken, they are pretty unsophisticated (i.e. they 
consist simply of a series resistor).

This being said, you will probably want a clean microphone with good 
signal/noise ratio, a wide frequency response, and one that is relatively 
directional.  I don't know this for a fact, but I imagine that these things 
matter for VOX accuracy..

Hi Dirk,

Could you read the below message from another DMDX user and perhaps explain
what the problem might be if the mic impedance doesn't match the sound card.
Remember I am finishing a first study using DMDX's VOX and voice input.
Wanted to make sure that there wasn't some hidden problem in  my data.

I am running a program in which I want the frames to advance when the person
responds, with no timeout. I have tried to use the response contingency
<rc N> keyword but it tells me "response contingent frame without correct
response. Am I using the command incorrectly? if so what is the right way?
Is there a better way to do this? What is the N supposed to represent? Is
it the item number? The number of responses? The number of items with rc?
I am using version 2.1.00.
Thank You, 
Pam

Hiya Pam,

> responds, with no timeout.

I know nothing about the <rc> keyword but I'm doing a similar thing at the
moment, and use the keyword <ntl> (no time limit) so that there is no
timeout for the trials.

Hope that helps,
Stuart.

   Belay that, you don't want <rc> or anything fancy at all.  Stuart is 
right, see <NoTimeLimit>.  Although reading <ContinueProgressiveX> will

         You can get the effect you want by eliminating the frame delimiter 
.  Without that, DMDX proceeds to the next item as soon as the subject 
responds.  Thus:

>+2  "DRUGS";

I'm trying to use DMDX on a Japanese version of Windows 98/Me.

When I do the input device test of TimeDX, available devices 
(e.g. keyboard, mouse) are presented in Japanese, 
and the tests are successfully done 
(i.e., pressed key/button are highlighted).

But DMDX doesn't work.

(1) Using  <id "keyboard presented in TimeDX"> , 
    the following message is shown
   'Input Device <keyboard presented in TimeDX> selection failed'.
    In addition, a part of <keyboard presented in TimeDX> is 
    turned to illegal characters.

(2) Using  <id "mouse presented in TimeDX"> ,
    the following message is shown
   'Missing quote in input device name <mouse presented in TimeDX>'.

Are there any good ideas to clear these problem that are caused by 
processing 2-byte characters ?

   Unfortunately no.  Other than trying to use a different font which I 
don't think you can do.  Only possible thing is for you to do is to send me 
a copy of your OS (you can probably just FTP the cabinets to me or if 
you're capable setup a server I can download them from) and for me to set a 
machine up here with those cabinets so I can see just what is going on, 
then I can modify DMDX to deal with the situation.  I might need a copy of 
whatever you use to edit them but hopefully not, I'm not exactly conversant 
in Japanese, if we're lucky just an item file made by you will 
suffice.  But you're into reimbursement territory and the current ante is a 
digital camera with some sort of zoom ability.

FYI: We have been putting together a system to do tachistoscopic displays.
The prototype system uses liquid crystal goggles and an 8-button response
box, with all of this controlled using DMDX. Our lab web page contains a
complete description of all the components, including sources and
estimated costs. Components can all be ordered separately from the sources
listed on the page.   -Michael

Jonathan -- the tolerances are ~1 ms on opening, and ~2 ms on reducing the
usable information to 10% of max. The crystals require ~4 ms to relax
after the electrical field is turned off but disperse the light quite
effectively after ~2 ms. Milgram provides much more detail in the '87
BRMIC paper.  -Michael

   It looks like the next version of DMDX has to be a substantial departure 
from what has gone before, to wit, I am going to have to start using the 3D 
capabilities that come with any video designed in the last three or four 
years.  Granted there is a lot of hardware out there that is being used for 
running DMDX that was designed more than four years ago, however the state 
of the computer industry, specifically the video card portion of it is that 
the features that DMDX use have become passe.  More to the point in looking 
through the latest release of DirectX (version 8) I notice that almost 
every function that DMDX uses has been dropped.  While this is not 
immediate cause for concern as legacy interfaces will always be supported 
it does mean that video card driver writers are not writing specifically to 
the feature set that DMDX uses.  Which would be fine if DMDX was a vanilla 
flavored application, it's not however, so we wind up with things like the 
situation with the GeForce series of video cards where DMDX crashes their 
drivers outright and has to be severely hobbled by limiting the number of 
back buffers it uses from up to 24 down to only 4 buffers.  And this is 
only the beginning.
   So the way around that is to redesign DMDX to use the features that the 
latest video cards are offering and at the moment it looks like I'll be 
able to build a much more robust display engine.  While I am technically 
using 3D interfaces you won't be able to tell the difference and because 
the cards are so damn fast the fact that DMDX's output is actually being 
rendered in 3D is moot.  What it does mean is that the extreme pipelining 
found in 3D cards that works against DMDX's current design will be made to 
work for us so DMDX will be in effect issuing commands that won't have any 
effect for something like two retraces so if DMDX is preempted it can be 
preempted for a lot longer than it ever used to be without making an error.
   The cost?  DMDX version 3 won't work on a lot of hardware currently used 
to run DMDX 2.  While the video cards are cheap enough (I can find TNT2 
Vanta cards for $30 on Price Watch and if you could find TNT1 cards they 
will be cheaper and just as good) some people are going to have to upgrade 
mother boards and CPUs as well because almost all 3D video cards are AGP 
devices and old Pentiums don't have AGP slots, nor do they really have the 
horse power for 3D operations.  While there are 3dfx PCI video cards that 
might be usable  and I also hear that NVIDIA makes PCI cards I'm betting 
that upgrading to a modern AGP motherboard will be the best option -- of 
course, that's probably going to mean a new ATX case as well...
   None of this will be happening soon, this is an extreme overhaul of 
DMDX's structure and it will likely take me months to complete, however I 
am letting people know about it so that purchasing decisions can be made 
with some forethought.

I've been having a problem with the screen freezing at run time with DMDX
2.4 that the syntax checker does not complain about. The program presents
a series of *.bmp files that are 902 kb and 480 X 640 in size that were
saved as 16-bit pictures. When this occurs I'm unable to get out of the
freeze with any key commands or by rebooting the computer and have to turn
off my surge protector, so I get no information from on what may have gone
wrong and lose all my data. The freeze occurs on different item lines and
on different items within the line and doesn't always occur (seems to happen
3 out of every 4 runs).

The video mode is set to 16 bit for 480 X 640. The only thing that seems
unusual is that for the fairly old 60 Hz monitor I'm using when I do the
advanced Time Video Mode test I get a value of 16.34 instead of 16.67, but
I've also had the freezing problem when using video goggles.
The svideo card is an ATI Rage 128 Pro 3D with 32 MB of RAM using an AGP
slot.
PC specs are: DFI AK74-SC motherboard with 64 MB RAM and 700MHz AMD Duron
CPU chip.

My programs consist of either 2 or 8 sets of 12 item lines. All *.bmp files
are 902 kb except the "SelfValence" file, which is just 38 kb. The code
consists of:

   I'd be suspecting general machine stability under those 
circumstances.  I have a couple of test programs you can run if you want me 
to send them to you.

   What drives the goggles?  Is it a DMDX task or is it another piece of 
software.  If another program is crashing all bets are off.

   Never been a fan of DFI motherboards.  How large is the power supply in 
the machine, we've seen strange behavior with 700MHz Durons with less than 
300W supplies.

   Looks fine to me, no scrambling so the item order is never going to 
change so if things are crashing it's almost got to be a non DMDX issue, or 
possibly an issue that DMDX is exposing.  I'm impressed the code handles 
white space at the beginning of the graphic file names.

We're currently playing with one of Keithley's PCI bus digital IO cards
(KPCI PIO24). We've got the card configured, and it recognizes the
attached devices. However, TimeDX can't locate the board for a PIO test,
most likely because we don't have the correct address. The Keithley
diagnostics for this card don't give us a way to determine the address
(as was possible with the PIO12). Is there a way to determine the correct
address (hex) for this card? Thanks,  -Michael Wenger

Michael -

Have you looked under the System Properties:Device Manager
(right-click My Computer, select Properties)? There should be a
listing for the PCI DIO card if Windows recognized it. Look under
Properties:Resources. The I/O range should be the address.

Regards,

Jesse

   I've never seen windows recognize one yet.  You have to read the docs, 
by default the card comes strapped for port 300 Hex.

We have a 250W power supply. I didn't find anything on your web pages about
problems with the DFI motherboards. We purchased these parts specifically
to run with DMDX, so it would be good to have problems like this noted on
your web site. 


If we order another power supply do you recommend 300W or slightly higher?

What motherboards have you had no problems with?


Thanks.

Jonathan,

What problems have you observed with the DFI motherboards, and will getting
a 300W or bigger power supply fix them?


Thanks.

   It's not a DMDX problem, any machine I've had that's had a DFI 
motherboard has been prone to weird problems.

   Ok, I'll bad mouth DFI there.

Jonathan -- Windows was able to recognize the card. From what I can tell,
the PCI cards assign ports based on an offset from a base address, rather
than a fixed address (e.g., 300 hex). For example, according to the
Keithley docs, the ports are monitored at the base address plus 0x00
offset. What I'm unable to tell is whether the base address refers to the
base address for the card or the PCI bus. Any ideas?  -Michael

Michael,

I don't have a Windows driver installed for my CIO/DIO 24 either, yet it 
functions perfectly on my stimulus box (running Windoze 98).  I ran into a 
problem with 300 Hex though... It conflicted with another device.  I 
believe that we are running the card at 310 Hex now, but don't have the 
machine in front of me just now.  On the ISA version of the card, this 
requires a change of jumper setting.  It also requires that you inform 
TimeDX of the whereabouts of the card... Try setting the base address to 
310 Hex rather than 300 Hex.  I'm pretty sure that the base address refers 
to that of the card.

   Ah, PCI, I was of course talking about the ISA adapters.  The only thing 
I can think of (other than me reading the entire manual of course) is to do 
as was suggested earlier on and to see what IO resources the device is 
using in the device manager.  PCI devices must declare themselves while ISA 
ones don't so windows must know what resources the card is using.

Hi there,

I'm wondering if it is possible with DMDX to send output to different ports
with a PIO12 device, and how this can be done. 

Thanks,
C. Amrhein

   I don't have one, beyond general guesses I can't provide much help 
here.  There's no Input/Output Range under the Resource type column?

   From the help file:


Output Keyword

<Output N>
<o N>
<op N>

Variant:

<OutputHex H>
<ox H>

     O switch alternative that outputs data to the currently installed 
output port. Item file must have selected
<InputDevice PIO12> or some other device that supports output. The variant 
accepts hexadecimal codes
instead of decimal codes, handy for the multi-byte output devices.

     If the input device PIO12 has been installed then 8 bits of output are 
provided on port C of the PIO 12. If the
PIO12output16 device has been installed 16 bits are output, the lower 8 to 
port C and the upper 8 to port B. If the
PIO12output24 device has been installed 24 bits are output, the lower 8 to 
port C and the middle 8 to port B and
the upper 8 to port A.

   People will be pleased to know that the preliminary results of my 
research into using the 3D interfaces of DirectX 8 are extremely 
positive.  There are a number of weaknesses with DMDX's current design, 
notably the reliance on users to time retrace durations and also I suspect 
dealing with very high retrace intervals (200Hz and over) will pose a 
problem.  Both of these problems will be done away with.  While video modes 
will still need to be timed I expect the automatic routines will do a 
flawless job of it as we are now working with the strengths of current 
video hardware as opposed to against them.  Currently all 3D video cards I 
have tested support the necessary features, TNT1, TNT2, GeForce MX and 
Savage 2000 cards.
   In addition I expect the possibility of display errors to either be very 
high in the case of a card that shouldn't be used with DMDX 3 or 
vanishingly close to zero for older 3D hardware like the TNT1 to 
unmeasurablely close to zero in the case of the GeForce MX.
   People needing multimon displays will in all likelihood need to buy 
either a Dual Head card from Matrox based on the G450 or the G400 or a Twin 
View card from NVIDIA based on the GeForce MX.  These AGP cards drive two 
displays and the reason one will preferable to the traditional two video 
card multimon solution is that one of the traditional cards must be a PCI 
card (no machine can have two AGP slots) and it is usually convenient to 
have the secondary display be used as the subjects display, meaning that 
unless you have a motherboard with a nice BIOS that lets you swap which 
display is the primary display your secondary display (and therefore the 
display that DMDX will be using) will be a PCI card.  Ignoring the 
difficulties in locating a 3D PCI card, DMDX will now be sending a constant 
stream of instructions to the display and if that display is on the PCI bus 
those commands are going to be issued quite a bit slower than ones issued 
to the AGP slot.  Whether such a bottle neck will be enough to cramp DMDX's 
style remains to be seen (there is a strong chance that DMDX's load will be 
trivial to all but the most ancient 3D hardware) but why take chances.

   Although I should mention that the TNT1 isn't that great seeing as it 
can't support the enhanced retrace rate test in TimeDX, not with the 
drivers I've got anyway.

I've got two pieces of info: From the properties sheet for the card, I get
the memory range as starting at

   C0 EE BF FE

And from the properties sheet for the driver for the card, I get the
following as the starting value for the memory range

  FE BF EE C0

So I am guessing that I need a conversion (suggestions?) to obtain values
that TimeDX can use. But I'm a little confused by the inverted orderings
on the pairs. Ideas?

   The card should not be reporting memory ranges at all, it should be 
reporting an Input/Output Range.  The card should have a 4 byte I/O range 
assuming it is actually emulating an 8255 (and it will have to if DMDX is 
to use it), if it's reporting memory addresses it either needs to be 
configured differently or it's not usable as it's not emulating an 
8255.  Right click on "My Computer", click the Device Manager tab, select 
the card, click Properites, click the Resources Tab.  Tell me what it says 
in that window.  Alternatively right click on "My Computer", click the 
Device Manager tab, click View Devices by Connection, select Computer, 
click Properites, click Input/output (I/O), find the card and tell me 
what's on that line.

Jonathan -- according to the Keithley specs and docs, the card DOES
emulate the 8255. With regards to your questions:

>  Right click on "My Computer", click the Device Manager tab, select

"Use auto settings" is checked (the machine is running W'98). 
Interrupt request  11
Memory range       FE BF EE C0   FE BF EE FF
Memory range       FE BD EE A0   FE BF EE BF

> Alternatively right click on "My Computer", click the

Doesn't find the card when I/O is clicked. It DOES find the card when I
list by IRQ and memory.

   Well it's not emulating an 8255 until it's providing I/O ports, believe 
me.  You'll have to find out how to configure the card or return it and get 
a card that does provide I/O ports.  Perhaps the Computer Boards PCI card 
is a better choice.

"Emulating an 8255" was the critical phrase for the tech support people at
Keithley. It turns out that there is an API that needs to be installed
with the board drivers. This API allows for IO emulation. Installation and
configuration takes a little time, but once completed the emulator assigns
a fixed IO address that makes DMDX quite happy. For anyone interested in
using the Keithley boards, I'll be updating the description of our
tachistopic goggles with the installation and configuration instructions
on our lab web site: http://www.nd.edu/~mwenger (click on "Preprints").

Dear friends,
=20
I'm a new DMDX user. I am tring to present a self-paced reading task =
with one sentence per frame. The subject read the first sentence, press =
space when they had read it , then read the following sentence and then =
press space again. If the current sentence is not the target one, space =
key only works to request a following sentence. But if the current =
sentence is the target one, I need to get a RT for it. For I don't want =
subjects to know which sentence is the target, the space bar should =
worked as a response key when the current sentence is the target. After =
finishing a whole passage, there will be a question and subjects are =
asked to press Right or Left Shift to answer the question.

=20
My question is whether the spacebar( or any other key) can be the =
request key in one item, and then be the response key in another item? =
Is anybody do something like this before? Could you give me an example?
=20
Thanks in advance.

Thanks Jonathon. I can get DMDX to do the self-paced reading by the
following syntax:

<ep><azk><cr><id "keyboard"> <dbc 255255255><zor [3]> <vzk +Space> <vzk +f>
<vzk +j> <eop>
+1 <umnr><umpr><mpr +space><mnr +f><mnr +j>*  "Polo is Mary's friend.";
+2 * "Mary has her own bookshop.";
3  "?????"%50/;
+4 <umnr><umpr><mpr +f><mnr +j><mnr  +space> * "Is Mary a teacher?";
+5 <umnr><umpr><mpr +space><mnr +f><mnr +j> * "Mark is a little boy.";
+6 * "Jenny is his younger sister.";
+7*"One day, Mark go to the cinema with Jenny.";
13  "?????"%50/;
+14 <umnr><umpr><mpr +j><mnr +jf<mnr  +space> * "Was Jenny go to the
cinema?";
$9     "The end";$

However, I only need to get the RTs of item 2 and item 6(the target
sentence), not every sentence, such as item1, 5, and 7, though I hope they
could also present on the screen until the subject press the spacebar. How
can I change the syntax?

Thanks!

   You'll want to use an instruction (no correct response indicator and no 
clockon, you could also optionally use an item number of 0) and map the 
spacebar to the request:

5 <umnr><umpr><mr +space> "Mark is a little boy.";
+6 <umr><mpr +space><mnr +f><mnr +j>* "Jenny is his younger sister.";

Thanks Jonathon. However, after running the following syntax
+2 <umr><mpr +space><mnr +f><mnr +j>* "Jenny is his younger sister.";
it wont move on to the next item. I still not sure why.

Cheers,

   Because it's looking for a request after the response but you've mapped 
the spacebar to the positive response so it can never see a request.  On 
the items you are using to gather a response with the spacebar you probably 
want to force the item to continue by putting a C in those 
frames.  Alternatively you can put <ContinuousRun> in the parameter line 
and renumber all the items that don't gather an RT to 0 as items with item 
number 0 have the special property of always waiting for a request when 
<cr> is active.

   Looks like we won't be seeing a new version of DMDX any time 
soon.  While I thought leveraging the strengths of 3D cards would yield a 
far more robust DMDX it would appear that any benefits to be had require 
will very recent hardware.  That and drivers that don't exist yet.  While I 
can build a tachistoscopic display easily enough what I can't do is use 
multiple threads to update the display as DMDX's current design would 
entail.  All drivers are summarily blown out of the water one way or 
another.  I'll keep plugging away but either DMDX's display routines will 
undergo a complete overhaul so all display operations occur within a single 
thread or things like Digital Video will be dropped.

Dear DMDXers,

I am a new DMDX user and want to use it to display MPGs in a fMRI
experiment.
The scanner sends one ttl-pulse for each scan (28 per 3 s) or one pulse
per volume (TR = 3s). The pulse is fed into the gameport. To synchronize
video and scanner I want that DMDX waits for some pulses and then starts
to display the MPG. Responses from the subject are not needed in this
case.
Something like
    0 "wait for MR pulse ";
    0 "wait for another MR pulse ";
    1 <dv> "video1.mpg" /;
seems to work, but the delay needed for reading and prepearing the MPG
differs differs between trials. Can I somehow put the lines into one or
foce DMDX to do the time-consuming jobs before the pulse ?

Thanks for any suggestions,

   No, that leading time is part of DirectShow, not under our control.  The 
best you can do is note the preparation times for all items and find the 
longest one, convert that to ticks and then use that plus a bit as a 
<Delay> parameter fixing the ISI between trials to that amount thus 
allowing a constant time from the fMRI's signal to DMDX's commencing 
display.  If that's too inconvenient because the delay is too long you'll 
have to give some serious though to having DMDX trigger the fMRI -- which 
tends to be the way most people use it with DMDX as the controller rather 
than the controlled.

This is a bit tricky - we've had similar problems (though less serious)
using DMDX to play out speech files in sync with an fMRI scanner. The
solution we used is the same one that Jonathan suggested, noting down
preparation times and then adding a bit of leeway for the delay parameter.
Of course, you need to check this on the same machine as will be used in
the scanner. You also might want to ensure that that machine's hard drive
is not too full and gets defragmented regularly (since this will affect
disk access times).

An alternative solution is to use DMDX to record the pulses from the
scanner (one per TR) - that way you can use the DMDX output file to
reconstruct the exact time (in scans) at which your stimulus presentation
occurred. This solution allows DMDX timing to drift somewhat but would
still allow you to use the correct timings when analysing your data. I
think that this is what Jonathan means (using DMDX to trigger the
acquisition of an MRI scan is not practical since the fMRI signal will vary
depending on the inter-scan interval).

The ideal solution, however, would be to include an option in the software
for DMDX to load video and sound files into ram at a pre-specified time
(e.g. before the start of a run). This would depend on having a machine
with lots of RAM (especially for video files). Is there any chance of this
for a later version of DMDX?

You can't use dmdx to trigger the onset of each TR on the scanner, only the 
onset of the scan.  But Jonathan is right, you can just add a <delay> 
before the display of each item if you know the longest preparation time.

However, there are other benefits of allowing dmdx some leeway in the onset 
of the stimuli.  Allowing the onset of the stimuli to "drift" is a good 
thing in fMR analysis, rather than having all stimuli systematically synced 
to the onset of the TR (there are refs by Friston and Anders Dale 
demonstrating this).  You don't actually have to record each tr pulse from 
the scanner in order to do this.  We use the dmdx trigger to start the 
scanner so that we're sure the onset of the first stimulus is synced with 
the onset of scanning, then we just use the dmdx output file to give us the 
onset time of each stimulus item.  The TR timing will be exact throughout, 
as will the timing to collect each slice within the TR.   By the way, using 
this method then allows us to do self-paced experiments in the scanner as well.

   One of the labs here just bought a PCI version of the interface card 
DMDX uses because the machine they want to use it in doesn't have any ISA 
slots so I just tossed it into my test system to see how it would 
function.  Beyond having to use the CD provided with the PCI-DIO24 to 
provide windows with a driver it would appear to be perfectly useable by 
DMDX.  However a little extra care will be needed as the I/O port for the 
8255 can move around, usually as hardware is added or removed from the 
machine.  To find out what port the card was using I examined it's 
properties in the Device Manager and looked at the Resources tab and found 
the I/O resource that was 4 ports in size (as opposed to the memory 
resource, the interrupt resource and the other I/O resource that is 128 
bytes [80 Hex] in size), it's base was D800 so I entered this into the PIO 
base address in the TimeDX PIO Test and all was groovy.  If I added or 
removed hardware from that machine I would have to check that that resource 
didn't move, if it did I would have to change TimeDX's setting again.  The 
only way out of this would be to buy the software that Measurement 
Computing sells and create a new input device in DMDX that used their 
drivers -- whether everyone that bought a PCI-DIO24 would have to do this 
or not I don't know.

Hi,=20
1- I need to play a large wav file, like 2 Megs.
DMDX takes time to load the file before it plays it.
Is there a way to handle this more efficiently.

2- Is there a code to specify the timing for a sound file to be played. =
For ex. play a sonf for only 10 sec.

Thanks

   If you don't need accurate timing you can use the streaming audio 
keyword <sa> instead of <wav>.  It won't buffer the sound and will 
therefore have disc access activity as the item is presented and RTs 
gathered (typically detrimental to accuracy).

   Yep, try the Sound section in the help file.

     Hi friends out there who are studying the same thing I am
 my name is Jean-Pierre. I am working on my doctrate in =
psycho-linguistics at the University of Provence in the south of France. =
The topic  is orthographic processing in visual word recognition.
     I would like to know if it's possible to realize a word =
identification  task with DMDX,so the  situation is the following: mask =
(######) then prime (30 ms), then target(80 ms). The subjects have to =
write on the keyboard what they saw , this is the type of response which =
is required; so the question is with DMDX is it possible to write a =
control file, in the parameter line or elsewhere, that permits the =
subject to respond by typing on the keyboard.=20
     I'm anxious to hear from someone who perhaps can clue me in.  =
Thanks

Hi Jean-Pierre,

> that permits the subject to respond by typing on the keyboard.

I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the keyword you
want is <ZillionEnterKey> or <zek>. The DMDX help file describes this really
well - in particular it notes that <NoTimeLimit> and <ContinuousRun> are
probably keywords you want to use with this...

Hope that helps,
Stuart.

Just noticed something that I thought it might be useful to implement in a
new release of DMDX...

In general, lines in azk files consist of an item number, then one or more
spaces, and then a measure of reaction time. This is great, as it allows me
to use Matt Davis' very useful getdat.awk script
(http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/dmdx.html#Getdat) to
produce a columnar tab-delimited data file for import into Excel.

However, some of my subjects have been giving reaction times of greater than
10 seconds, and so a typical section of my azk file looks like this:

    19  5426.37
    12-10367.59
   113 -4710.84

i.e. for item 12 above, there is no space between the item number and
reaction time. Reaction times of greater than 100 seconds generate the same
effect. This means that, as it stands, getdat.awk just ignores data for
these items - there's no consistent separator between the two values.

Might it be possible for a future build of DMDX to always put at least one
space after the item number do you think please, Jonathan? It's a minor
point, but might prove useful for many people, especially if they use Matt's
script or something similar...

Continued thanks for the great program!
Stuart.

   Yeah, it'll be in there, if it's really useful to you I can release a

Thanks for that Jonathan - just whenever you get a chance is fine.

   It's pretty quiet right now and it's been months since I released a new 
version so 2.4.06 is now available.  It always leaves a space between the 
item number and the RT, formatting for RTs under 10 seconds remains the 
same however.

Hi, we're trying to set up an experiment with auditory stimuli and a fixed 
stimulus onset asynchrony of 2000 ms.

Some sound files need to trigger the timer at onset, others at a cue point 
in the file. So we have lines like these below:

-8 <wav 2> *"raccourci";
+5 <wav 2> "dynastie" <svp n> /*;

Is it possible to use the d parameter to get these files to begin every two 
seconds? We've been trying using the d parameter with a short timeout, but 
the onset asynchrony seems to be longer than expected and variable. Will it 
depend on the duration of the file and or response?

Any advice gratefully received!

One thing you could do Gareth is to use stereo files with a fixed length of 
silence on the second track.

   Yep.  You will need to make sure that the display is active for longer 
than the response timeout to get rid of that variability.  For instance 
assuming a t4000:

+5 <wav 2> "dynastie" <svp n> /* <%ms 4000>/;

   Using the length of a wave file to determine a display's duration (or an 
item's duration as in item 8) is not recommended as you are relying on a 
calculation to determine the duration of the display as opposed to 
specifying it.  Also item 8's structure will yield variability because DMDX 
will spinning until the wave file is finished playing, another uncertain 
duration.

Hi,

You could be interested by two programs (in perl) I made :

azk2txt: it formats your dmdx output: (errors, display problems, and =
conditions (if your item number is correctly coded))

mean: if your file is organised by line, it removes the outliers (you =
can see an example in the zip file)=20

You can download them on http://www.borisnew.org/stories.php?topic=3D6

Hope they will be useful!!

Pb : immediate triggering of the DigitalVOX signal 

Dear List, 

I have the following problem with the digital VOX which I use for a naming task experiment : 

DigitalVOX always triggers immediately (RT = 1.00 for "+" items, "wrong" for "-" items), whatever the threshold setting, and indeed even if the "microphone" and / or "line" in are set to "mute" in the recording control dialog box. 

Below is an example of the "rtf "control file which I use for testing purposes. I work on a MITAC laptop with a AMD processor (K6) under Window 98 (4.10.2222A). I now use Dmdx version 2.4.06, but I started with 2.4.02 (same behaviour concerning this problem). I have DirectX version 7. The sound board is unknown to me, but the audio drive is ES1869 from ESS Technology. 

The set VOX on the Dmdx main menu seems fine (triggering at audio input). Setting the threshold beyond or much beyond an apparently satisfactory level does help, even setting it to maximum level. Using enhanced VOX does not help either (then I get constant RT = 4.00). 

TimeDX sound test and sound latency test are both ok (signal to noise ratio is 5 to 1). 

Strange as it might seem, my naming task did work ONCE (and only once) yielding correct response times for a 70 or so item control file, so that the hardware might be able to perform OK (?). 

Here is (one of) my rtf file : 

<n 4> <cr> <d 20> <fd 120> <azk> <dwc 000000000> <dbc 255255255> <id "DigitalVox"> <id "RecordVocal"> <id "keyboard"> <t 8000> 
0 "Press spacebar to start"; 
+101 * <bmp> "apple" /!; 
+102 * <bmp> "ashtray" /!; 
-103 * <bmp> "bear" /!;
+104 * <bmp> "bell"/!; 
0 "Thank you" /!; 

I have also tried to unmap all positive responses, and map it to the VOX signal only : same behaviour. 
Thank you for your help.

Dear Madeleine,
	I've also experienced that very same problem in a similar experiment.  Try
inserting the <t 8000> after each asterisk, instead of in the top command
line.  I believe that will clear the buffer each trial.  Anyway, doing this
solved this problem for me.  
 
For example, 

+101 * <t 8000> <bmp> "apple" /!;

   Hmm, that's interesting.  Using T in an item like that forces the 
RecordVocal device to re-setup itself each item, however that is done as 
the item is parsed, not when the clockon is encountered.  My guess is that 
there is some sort of noise present when a DirectSoundCapture buffer starts 
capturing, a little pop which triggers the VOX.  This would explain the VOX 
test functioning nicely but DMDX then running items producing different 
results as the capturing is started and stopped with each clockon but is on 
continuously in the VOX test.  Short of me modifying DMDX to include a 
response suppression option for the DSC stuff for a number of milliseconds 
(I was thinking about including that eons ago however I don't see any 
comments indicating I did add it so unless you can find something in the 
docs I'm betting I didn't implement it) there are only two things I can 
think of beyond the above kludge (if it works in your instance).  First is 
the old standby, get some newer drivers for the audio card or get another 
audio card.  Beyond that you could try tinkering with the enhanced VOX 
settings, say trying a larger window over which determine the 
threshold.  While this does fundamentally change the way the VOX works (you 
can't compare results across different settings as the latency of the 
trigger changes with window size) it should get around any small pops 
introduced by the hardware switching modes.

Dr. Forster,

I'm using a fairly new Dell Optiplex GX1p (pentium), which has new drivers.
 Also, using the enhanced vox does not solve the problem (I tried that
too).  Thanks, Steve Hecht

   Hmm, not good.  If the enhanced VOX doesn't solve the problem it's not 
just a simple spike when the capture is started.  You tried it with a large 
sliding window size too?  Only other thing I can think of trying short of 
me modifying the DigitalVOX device is to simply play a single wave file at 
the beginning of the item file.  It can be silence, all we're after is the 
request for DMDX to initialize the sound output and thus have both 
DirectSound and DirectSoundCapture initialized, perhaps there's some 
interaction and only having DirectSoundCapture initialized as you are 
currently using it has some odd effect.

I put the silence wav file and the <t 8000> in each trial line.  That
solved the problem for both my dell optiplex pc and inspiron laptop

   Also, people who are getting immediate triggers with the DigitalVOX 
might try setting the threshold to maximum and then seeing if the item file 
still produces RTs of 1ms.  While I don't expect this will solve your 
problems it will give me an insight into what is going on.

Dear Dr Hecht, dear Dr Forster, dear List

A) I thank you for your suggestion for item syntax, Dr Hecht :

+101 * <t 8000> <bmp> "apple" /!; 

I tried it, but it did not work on my computer. I also tried sevaral things like : 

+101 <t 8000> <bmp> "apple" / * <bmp> "apple" /!; 

hoping that capturing would start at the beginning of the item, one frame duration before the clock is set on (then the real response time would have been : RT + the first frame duration) but it did not work either. 

Does anyone know anyway to dissociate the "start capturing" event from the "clock on" event ? 

B) Dr Forster, in case this might be of any interest to you, I had a closer look at the "Test Vox" on my computer. I first said the Test Vox was fine, by which I meant that I could get a triggering of the DigitalVOX for a normal level of voice output from my subjects. Now I must say that I also always had a DigitalVOX triggering at the very beginnig of the TestVox when the dialog box opens. 

Following your suggestion, I tried to increase the size of the "enhanced window" parameter. I found that by repeatedly quitting and re-entering the Test Vox, I could adjust the "enhanced window" so as to suppress the Digital Vox triggering at the start of the test, and indeed also when running items.

The problem then is that : a) either I leave the VU parameter and the enhanced VU parameter at satisfactory level (i.e. triggering at normal voice levels), and then I need to increase the window size at values greater than 200 ms, or b) I use a window size of, say 120 ms, and then I have to adjust the two VUs at levels such that triggering occurs only when subject shout at the microphone. 

Thus one question I have is : to what extent does the setting of the enhanced window parameter to such large values as 200 ms impair the precision of response time measurements ?

   It wouldn't, the setup of the RecordVocal device is done during the 
inter item gap anyway.  My guess is that the fact that works for Steve is 
purely attributable to FM.

>Does anyone know anyway to dissociate the "start capturing" event from the

   You cant.  Well, actually you can, you don't use the DigitalVOX, you 
just record the vocalization with RecordVocal and use some other piece of 
software after the fact to analyze the recordings, but you probably want 
DMDX to be doing the RTs...

   Tada.  Horrible sound card.  It's got some kind of mixing glitch in 
there.  You might be able to look in the windows mixer and turn off other 
input channels if they are on and just leave the microphone enabled and 
this might solve your problem but that's clutching at hairs.  Perhaps if 
you are using the sound card's preamp (the microphone is just plugged 
straight into the sound card's MIC input) using an external preamp and the 
LINE IN input would not produce the glitch.  That or try another sound card ;)

   There are lurkers on this list who know a lot more about how the 
enhanced VOX features work as I put them in there at their request.  It 
will trigger on sibilant components of the input which has a separate 
threshold, if you don't want that set he sibilant threshold through to 
maximum.  It will increase the latency of triggers as a larger amount of 
energy has to be detected before the trigger threshold is reached, given 
that it's an amount of energy the time that various wave forms take to 
accumulate that energy is likely to be different, once again, lurkers like 
Dirk can probably give you a scientific answer, I'm just the 
programmer.  You could also set the window to a large enough size that you 
could conceivably miss short utterances but I doubt that 200ms is long 
enough for that.

   If this is not to your liking you can sponsor and addition to DMDX, a 
modification to the DigitalVOX device that allows suppression of triggers 
for a specified number of milliseconds.  I was looking at the code to do 
this yesterday and it's not non-trivial, that's a hairy little piece of 
code and I can't just reject a trigger once it's received and go find 
another so I'm not going to add it for gratis.  Unfortunately the current 
sponsor denotation is a digital camera with a zoom and preferably with a 
USB port which is a lot for a relatively small addition, but that's the 
state of the union.  Perhaps Steve would be amenable to splitting the 
donation with you as he appears to be affected by a similar shoddy sound 
hardware.

Dear DMDXers,
             We were experiencing exactly the same problem (immediate triggering 
of the DigitalVOX) here at Macquarie on a Dell Latitude C800 Laptop with ME and 
a Maestro soundcard running DMDX 1.3.01.  We tried updating the drivers, and 
while this did help somewhat, it did not remove the problem.  We also tried 
inserting the "silence" wav file, and this did not help either.  We then tried 
placing the <t 10000> parameter in each item, and this seems to have solved the 
problem.  I have no idea why, but it worked.  So thanks Dr Hecht for the tip!

Regards,
Anna W.

Hi Anna,
         Glad to hear that adding the <t 10000> parameter at each trial 
solved your problem.  I've found that by including both the t parameter and 
the silence .wav file solves the problem on all of my computers....Best, 
Steve Hecht

Hi,

I am new to DMDX and am writing my first program. I have a few questions 
about my code  -- which I include at the bottom of this email.  If you know 
the answers to any of my questions, I would greatly appreciate you sending 
them my way.

Thanks!
Melissa F. Schulz =)

1. DMDX REPETITION STRUCTURES: What is the DMDX equivalent to a C++  "int x 
= 0; While (x < 10){experimental trials; x++;}" repetition structure? Where 
would this repetition structure be placed relative to the code that is to be 
repeated? Also, will the effects of "scrambling" be maintained in code areas 
that are controlled by this structure?
2. UNLIMITED STIMULUS PRESENTATION (TERMINATED BY SHIFT KEY KEYPRESS): At 
the end of each trial sequence, I would like to display a "bmp" image for an 
unlimited amount of time. I would like the next trial sequence to begin by 
my participant's shift key response to this unlimited trial frame. How can I 
achieve this?
3. "SCRAMBLING" WHILE KEEPING PRACTICE AND EXPERIMENTAL TRIALS APART: I 
would like my practice stimuli to be "scrambled" and my experimental stimuli 
to also be "scrambled." However, I do not want them to be "scrambled" with 
each other. I tried to achieve  this by using a backslash to separate 
practice and experimental conditions. Will I also need to include the <msg> 
and <mss> parameters?
4. SIMULTANIOUS WAV AND BMP PRESENTATION: I am looking for a sample line of 
code that simultaneously presents wav and bmp files. If you have this, would 
you please send it my way.
5. TIMING PARTICIPANT RESPONSES IN MILISECONDS: My intent is to begin the 
clock  when the Target is shown.  To do this, I have written the following 
code: +2001 /* "R_PRATarget"  /;. Is there a better way to write this? I 
don't want to be even a few ms off on timing.
6. ANY ERRORS? =) The format of my experiment is the following:
Ready Signal(500ms) / Prime(2000ms) /Mask(200ms) /Target(unlimited exposure 
time).  I wish to measure participant RT to each Target by starting the 
clock  at the onset of the target and stopping it upon my participants right 
or left shift key press.  Is there anything preventing the following code 
from accomplishing this task effectively? Are any simplifying steps that can 
be implemented to increase readability?

   Scrambling reorders the script, then that script is processed item by 
item.  Branching is an extremely advanced capability, I would recommend 
starting with tasks that don't require it or use the old brute force method 
of duplicating the items the number of times they need to be 
executed.  Because the item file can be scrambled branching becomes very 
complicated and should only be attempted by someone who is very familiar 
with the ins and outs of scrambling.

DMDX list participants,

I am working to trigger several external devices using DMDX in each trial.
In particular we have a stimulator (box for delivering low-level electric
shocks) which was designed to use all 3 ports of a PIO-12 board (or the
CIO-DIO24 which we are using).  Is there any way to have DMDX talk to two
IO boards, such that we could have one control the stimulator and the
other for 'regular' IO (e.g. triggering our Neuroscan Synamps)?

Any assistance is appreciated,
Ed Bernat

   Not as DMDX stands.  I could add such capability but that's a *lot* of 
editing and you'd have to reimburse me for my efforts.

   Looks like the latest 12.41 video drivers from NVIDIA don't fix the 
issues that DMDX has with the GeForce2 video cards.  While I only have a 
GeForce2 MX I strongly suspect the error in their driver occurs with all 
GeForce chips when DMDX is run on them.

Dear DMDX users:


I would like to present a bmp image that moves across the screen in one
continuous linear motion. One way of doing it is to prepare an .avi file
and present it as a stimulus of type "digital video". However, since
this is such a simple (and standard) constellation, I suspect there must
be an easier way of doing it. I tried the "animate" function to present
a bitmap, then reschedule it repeatedly while a counter modfies the x
(or y) coordinate of the bitmap. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to get
this to work .At the beginning of each trial, I initialize a counter to
a certain initial x coordinate value (such as <SetCounter 1,10>, then
get the animation going including an <x> command, and for each
subsequent frame presentation, the counter is incremented (e.g., <inc
1>) such that the x coordinate is continually being modified.  My
problem is how to pass the counter value to the declaration of the
coordinate ( <x N> ).  To my knowledge, <SetCounter> only allows
variables with a numerical name (which I find somewhat confusing - why
can't one create a variable named "variable", "counter" or "index" or
similar?) whereas <x> accepts only numerical arguments - how do I get
the value of the counter into x? If I state <x 1>, it will of course
interpret 1 as a coordinate, and not as the value of counter 1.  Any
suggestions? Is there a hidden trick that I should know about?  Or is
there an altogether simpler solution to this problem?

   The <AgainWhen> switch wouldn't work with a counter even if you could 
specify an x coordinate with a counter as counter values only change across 
items whereas <aw> works within an item.  To move a bitmap across the 
screen you have to simply specify each of the frames, tedious yes, but 
perfectly easy.  The <aw> is only for a cycling display, you would only use 
it if you wanted the bitmap to move across the screen multiple times.

Dear DMDX users:

"Sound cards also tend to mix the output into the input as well, if you

An experimental task that I commonly use is to present a sound file

response. The above suggests that this is problematic as the sound file
will interfere with the "Digital Vox" device. Do all sound cards mix the

separation of both streams? Is it worth trying out various makes/models?

   I suspect the older cards are more problematic however I don't have a 
very large N to judge by here.  In any event it's possible that with some 
combination of mixer settings that you could override that behavior, I 
guess you'd have to see a Wave output device in the recording controls.

Dear Jonathon,

I am working on a script in which 2 images are simultaneously displayed,
and the subject is required to determine which item he saw at study.  I
am having difficuly figuring out how correct/incorrect responses are
output in DMDX.  In my program I have specified the correct response for
each item with the appropriate sign before the item number and also with
mpr and mnr. Below is the parameter line and a portion of the script:
<NumberOfItems 19> <RecordClockOnTime> <ContinuousRun> <id keyboard> <id
mouse> <FrameDuration 375.09377> <NoFeedback> <azk> <zil> <zor>  <vzk
+Button 0> <vzk +Button 1> <VideoMode 1024 768 768 16 0> <Delay 50>
<FontMultipliers 2.5>

0 Ready;
-1001 <umpr> <umnr> <mnr +Button 1> <ms% 2000> WHICH OBJECT IS OLD?/ *
<NoTimeLimit> <jpg 0.01> <bm 0.85> jKCfountainO, <jpg 0.51> <bm 0.85>
jKCfruitS* <cr>;
-1002 <umpr> <umnr> <mnr +Button 1>  <ms% 2000> WHICH SCENE IS OLD?/ *
<NoTimeLimit> <jpg 0.01> <bm 0.85> jDTplateO, <jpg 0.51> <bm 0.85>
jDTpineS* <cr>;

When I look at the output file, I receive information about which button
the subject pressed, but no information about whether or not this was a
positive or negative item.  Below is an example of the output:
Item 1001 COT 0 2153.1 2153.1 +Button 0
Item 1002 COT 4277.06 0 1350.27 +Button 1

Any thoughts or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Scott Hayes

   Actually, you don't want <zil> and <zor>, or the <vzk> stuff at all, 
plain vanilla one of two responses <azk> should do you just fine.

Dear All,

I am having problems using the input type keywords with double responses and
feedback, wonder if anyone could advise me on these.

My experiment include two sessions(For details, please read the script in
the following). For the training session, four signals are presented
randomly, only one response is required, the feedback display is required.
For the test session, no feedback is required. Items 101-104 only require
one response, items 105-108 require two responses.

My questions are:
1. For the training session, there is NOT feedback. Even I use feedback
setting before item 1:

+1000 <zor><cfb "right"> <wfb "wrong"> * " Short: S, Long: L"/;

How to set so that the feedback appear?

2. For items 105-108 of the test session, when two valid keys were pressed
(eg.'SL'), the item did NOT continues on to the next until time out. How to
set so that the item continues on to the next when two valid keys were
pressed.

I would be grateful for any help.

Many Thanks,
Kylie

   You need <nfb 0> in the body if the item file.  While it isn't (but 
should be) noted in the docs <zil> by default turns <NoFeedBack> on.

   You can't do it, regular zillion responses is going to wait for the 
timeout to expire before moving on to the next item.  In your case that's 
20 seconds.  Well, it would be if you didn't have <ztr 2> in the parameter 
line, <Zillion TypedResponses> is for typed words and requires an enter key 
to finish an item's responses.  Remove the <ztr 2>, even if it is 
overridden by having <zor> in the items that follow, I can't begin to guess 
what your item file actually is after a multi-scrambling session -- 
assuming it does scramble at all, I don't see any S parameter in there 
anywhere, are you sure you need multi-scrambling?

   If you want to gather exactly two responses but not have to wait for the 
timeout to expire I suggest having two items, group them <g 2>, specify a 
low <Delay> and have the second item present a clockon.

Does it matter that the scipt has a plus instead of minus in mapping the
negative response here ('<mnr +Button 1>)? I thought it had to be '<mnr
-Button 1>'.

Hmmm . . . When I use <mnr -Bit4> I get time until both button press and
time until button release, as I do for <mpr +Bit2>:

 . . .
Item 1019, COT 94595.80
  1484.36,+Bit4 1807.07,-Bit4
Item 1020, COT 99634.23
  1155.84,+Bit2 1470.80,-Bit2
 . . .

I hope these pluses and minuses still refer to presses and releases.

Dear Jonathon,

Thanks a lot for your advice.

I tried to follow your suggestion:
>If you want to gather exactly two responses but not have to wait for the
> timeout to expire I suggest having two items, group them <g 2>, specify a
> low <Delay> and have the second item present a clockon.

Now, I have facing another problem of multi-scrambling. As I mentioned
before, my experiment includes two sessions(For details, please read the
script in the following). The first session are presented before second
session. For the first session, four items are presented randomly. For the
second session, eight items are presented randomly but item 2002 must follow
item 2001, item 2012 must follow item 2011.

My question is:
For the second session,  eight items are presented randomly but item 2002
must follow item 2001, item 2012 must follow item 2011.  Can I do it?  How
to do it?


Many Thanks,
Kylie

   Yes, that is because you haven't unmapped the default mappings, if you 
put a <umb> in there you'd only get the releases.

   Yes, perfectly possible, you want:

<ms# 1>
<ms# 1> <ms# 2>
0 "The end" l;
<ms# 2> <ms# 1>


   If you put more items in a later date but there is no particular 
clumping that you need then your S parameters should probably get the value 
1 for both scrambles.

I do unmap the positive and negative responses for every item:

   Although looking at again this won't work as the <ms# 2> will move with 
the 1001 item during the first scramble thus demonstrating the deceptive 
nature of multi-scrambling.  You'll probably want something like this 
instead that locks the second scramble delimiters down during the first 
scramble:

<n 14><cr>  <mss 1,4> <mss 2,2> <msg 2,2>  <vm 1024 768 768 16 0 >

   Ah, +Bit4 is a VOX input, technically not a positive response but gets 
used as one anyway so <umpr> doesn't unmap it.  You want at least one 
<umvk> in there...

Dear Friends,
I am running an experiment on the subejct of perceptual asynchrony and I 
have tried to set up the experiment with dmdx. But there have been several 
problems I wish to seek your help for.
1) I get this error :

DirectSoundCreate failed
  DSERR_ALLOCATED (8878000a)
  The call failed because the resources (such as priority level) were
  already being used by another caller

and i have read what the help file has said about it but my problem is that 
i don't know how to find that "something else" which is taking exclusive 
access to directSound. Where should i look for it and how should i kill it? 
(reseting has had little effect on the error coming up)

2) My dmdx program continues to run after I click OK in reponse to the above 
error message but when that it starts to run the parameter file it suddenly 
stops with the following error:

Missing item number <R>

below is my parameter file to which this error has occured. I wonder if 
anybody could help me with this,
Thank you all,
bahador bahrami

   Use cntrl-alt-del and look at the other programs running.  Use it on a 
few other machines, use it on a newly setup machine, learn what the normal 
tasks are that run to maintain windows (like systray and explorer are 
critical parts and should never be shut down).  Successively shut down 
tasks with the cntrl-alt-del End Task button, try DMDX after each task is 
shut down and see which one is the culprit.  You might have to restart 
windows when you shut down the wrong task as things will stop functioning 
when those tasks are gone.  When you find which task it is uninstall that 
package, if you can't figure out which package it is run msconfig.exe and 
examine the startup pane and uncheck the offender.  It's also possible that 
the path present on that msconfig pane might tell you what application is 
associated with the offending task.

   Well seeing as when I syntax check it I don't get past <ms> not being a 
keyword (it's <ms%>, ie <ms% 150>, not <ms %150>) I'm guessing it's a 
problem with your parameter line and when it wraps DMDX isn't seeing it and 
is taking  one of the Rs in your parameter line as the first item 
number.  After fixing that it's ok.  Your parameter line probably needs to 
become:

<ep> N16 <s 16><azk> <cr> <nfb> f38 <t 4000> d150 <id "keyboard">
<dbc 0> <dwc 000255000> <vm 640 480 480 32 0> <mnr +left shift>

I've found what appears to be a discrepancy between the timing I expect
according to the total number of tics in my script and the clock on times
that I get in my output. 

One question I have is: How does the RT window specified in the parameter
line get added into the timing for each item line? My script records RTs
up to 2500 ms, but the stimuli presented during this interval are much shorter
than this. Does the DMDX then wait 2500 ms before initiating the next item
line, or is it recording the RT while the next item line is being presented?


Also, even with the 2500 ms added to the total tics in my item lines I get
a discrepancy of around 1300 to over 1600 ms per item line (clock on times
show differences of around 7500 to 9500 ms, whereas total ms according to
the tics in the item lines range around 3600-5600 ms. 

The parameter line:

<ep> t2500 f.5 d90 <zil> <nfb> <df Arial> <dfs 26> <cr> <RecordClockOnTime>
<mip 27> <vm 640,480,480,16,0> <wc 000255000> <ID Keyboard> <ID PIO12>
<bgc 000000000> <eop> 


The first few item lines:

+1001<umpr> <umnr> <mpr +Bit2>/ %150 / %12 / %30 g" E:\Data\Fetzer\SelfValence.bmp"/
%20 g" E:\Data\Fetzer\crosshair.bmp"/ %10 o1 /%2 g *" E:\Data\Fetzer\2850.bmp"/%6

g" E:\Data\Fetzer\Bs4m07f.bmp"/<incic 1>;

and the corresponding COT's:

Item 1001, COT 0.00
587.45,+Bit1 1060.15,-Bit1
Item 1002, COT 9776.57
759.10,+Bit2 1379.69,-Bit2
Item 1003, COT 18735.65
1374.23,+Bit4 1989.58,-Bit4

The stimuli are 16-bit 901k each and the pc has a 233 MHz processor with
64 MB of RAM, a Gig of free space with DMDX and all files run from the same
directory. The machine is very clean-no internet, virus, or other potentially
interfering software even loaded on it.

Is there something I'm missing that's adding to the run time, or is the
t2500 a problem when the individual item lines don't have a lag to accomodate
this before the next item line? 

Thanks for your help.

Hi Everyone,
    This is a rather remidial question but I'm stumped.  I'm a novice at the
DMDX program and have just begun playing around with it.  I am not able to
get the demo programs to run.  I have consulted the Discussion list archieve
and done everything that was suggested here with no luck.  The following
error message appears:
        Could not find Registry Key <SOFTWARE\TimeDx\2\0Primary Display
Driver\640x480 (480)_8bpp_Ohz>
        A reguest has been made to use the 640x480 (480) 8 bits per pixel
Ohz video mode.  You need to use the Time Dx 2's         advanced\Time Video
Mode option and tune some values for anticipating the vertical retrace.
This error message pops up when I try to run the demo and when I run the
Tachistoscopic Acid Test.  Also when I run the Digital Video Test the
following message appears:
        Failed to open File
        VFW_E_NOT_FOUND (80040216
        An object or name was not found

I have tried to change the video mode to the correct setting and it is
already set to the proper value.

If anyone could offer some suggestions I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you for your time.

   It waits until there is a response.  If you want to account for every 
single tic of an item file you will have to ensure that the display is 
active for longer than your RT timeouts.

   Once the subject has responded DMDX moves on to the next item.  There 
are cases where it will always wait the specified timeout interval, using 
the RecordVocal device and normal <zil> responses come to mind.

   You need to time that video mode and store the values in the registry. See:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhhowtouseit.htm

   And then:

   That error means it can't find the digital video file referenced in the 
most recent item.  Perhaps you didn't unzip all the of files to the same 
location.

Dear Friends,
I am running an experiment on perceptual asynchrony and I have tried to set 
up the experiment with dmdx. But there have been several problems I wish to 
seek your help for.
1) I get this error :

DirectSoundCreate failed
  DSERR_ALLOCATED (8878000a)
  The call failed because the resources (such as priority level) were
  already being used by another caller

and i have read what the help file has said about it but my problem is that 
i don't know how to find that "something else" which is taking exclusive 
access to directSound. Where should i look for it and how should i kill it 
(reseting has had little effect on the error coming up)?

2) My dmdx program continues to run after I click OK to the above error 
message but when that it starts to  the parameter fi, it suddenly stops with 
the following error:

Missing item number <R>

below is my parameter file about which this error has been raised. I wonder 
if anybody could help me with this,
Thank you all,
bahador bahrami

Dear friends,
I am sending this email to ask those kind friends who have taken the trouble 
of answering my last mail titled 'Missing item number <R>' to once again 
send me their replies.
Due to some filtering problem in my email account, I have not been able to 
recieve any emails from any of cybergroups I have been a memebr of during 
last two weeks. As a result, I have been unable to get your valuable 
giudelines regarding my question either. I only understood the nature of my 
problem when I saw that I hadn't even recieved my own mail to DMDX group.
I hope this inconvenience will not discourage you from keeping sending me 
your helpful mails.
Sincerely,
Bahador Bahrami

Dear Friends,
I am running an experiment on the subejct of perceptual asynchrony and I 
have tried to set up the experiment with dmdx. But there have been several 
problems I wish to seek your help for.

I get this error :

DirectSoundCreate failed
  DSERR_ALLOCATED (8878000a)
  The call failed because the resources (such as priority level) were
  already being used by another caller

and i have read what the help file has said about it but my problem is that 
i don't know how to find that "something else" which is taking exclusive 
access to directSound. Where should i look for it and how should i kill it 
(reseting has had little effect on the error coming up)?

Another question:
If a line pertaining to One trail gets too long so that part of it is 
transfered to the next line, will i get such error:

Missing item number <R>

Although there has not been any new line introduced (just the rest of some 
line remaining)?

Line example:
+1 <fd 150 > <bmp> "fixation" /<ms %150><bmp> "rv" /<ms %17><bmp> "ro"/<ms 
%51><bmp> "go" / *<fd 225> <bmp> "mask"/ ;

This may be obvious, but it could be an editor problem.  Some kind of 
unicode formatting word may have been added that tells your editor to wrap 
to the next line and DMDX may be having a problem with this.  Try the 
script using another editor or have a look at your script in NotePad or DOS

I haven't been able to work out how to get the <clfb> parameter to work
properly (or at all in fact) -- I would like it so that the stimulus is
visible until the participant responds, and then is blanked immediately
upon response.

Any help is appreciated.

Here is a simple method.  Omit the last frame delimiter and the frame timer.

+1001<ms% 3000> <ln -1>"Describes God?"/! * <ln 1>"absent" ;

If you want to get rid of feedback, then include <nfb> on the parameter
line.

Just tried this, and no joy. The stimulus still does not disappear
instantly (maybe this is just not possible?) but rather after a noticeable
delay;  furthermore now my intertrial interval has upped and gone.

   The feedback delay is 2 ticks, perhaps the machine you're running on is 
so slow that it takes a significant amount of time to prepare the 
feedback.  Can't imaging another reason for it being noticeably 
delayed.  You could try assembling your own feedback subroutine but unless 
the code is doing something I'm not aware of I can't see it being 
quicker.  See the Branch docs for a clue:

I have got it working now. Basically removing the last frame delimiter was
all that was needed, as you both suggested. Don't know what the problem
was before. I'm running it on a Dell P3 800 MHz so I was pretty sure my
machine was not at fault -- the delay was about 2 seconds! Rather I think
I had made a silly error somewhere along the line and after playing enough
suddenly it worked.

I ended up with a parameter line of:

<n 367> <s 30> <azk> <cr> <d 40> <t 5000> <id "keyboard"> <dbc 0> <clfb>
<dwc 100100255> <vm 1024,768,768,16,0> <umpr> <umnr> <mpr +/> <mnr +OEM
Key 102>

and a typical item like:

+1001<ms% 3000> <ln -1>"Describes God?"/! * <ms% 2000><ln 1>"absent";


Thanks for your help.

Hi.  You were right about the other GeForce cards.  We have just got a new 
machine with 32M NVIDIA GeForce2 MX card and it don't like DMDX.  Is this 
something you  are going to address, Jonathan, or should we think about 
getting a new card?

Thanks

   Just run it with a shortcut like this:

C:\DmDX\dmdx.exe -buffers 4

   It means DMDX won't be able to buffer more than three frames ahead so 
items with more than three visual frames in them will have blitting going 
on while the item is executing.  This is usually not going to be a problem 
as the blitters on the GeForce2 chips are so damned fast, typically a whole 
screen is blitted in under 4 milliseconds, however if you expect to be 
gathering responses from a PIO12 as those frames are displayed you might 
consider lowering the maximum lines to blit such that only a millisecond is 
ever spent blitting at a time.  My testing shows only minimal disruption to 
the millisecond callback as blitting is going on as opposed to the major 
disruptions to detecting the retrace but it doesn't cost too much to be 
safe and lowering the maximum lines to blit also improves retrace detection 
as blitting is going on.  Not that loosing track of the retrace is too much 
of an issue either, with access to the high performance timer DMDX can go 
for substantial periods without seeing a retrace before it is likely to 
make an error.

   I was trying to address this with version 3 but I ran into several brick 
walls and one of those walls was a wall that I implicitly assumed I wasn't 
going to run into with the redesign.  So I'm fairly sure that line of 
research is dead.  I may yet build a new version three that still uses the 
3D features of video devices so I can once again buffer huge amounts of 
display before an item starts executing but it will more than likely 
include version two's retrace synchronization methods.  But it's a huge 
amount of work, effectively I must rewrite something like 66% of the code 
(including the sound and digital video code) to address concerns that as 
far as I can tell are just not costing very much right now, it's more like 
advance action to avoid the possible obsolescence of DMDX but I've got 
years to go before that happens.  Not only that but the long term 
prognostications are that these 3D chips will only be around for a few 
years anyway, after that CPUs will be so damned fast it will make no sense 
to have a separate GPU rendering graphics.

   Hopefully 2.4.07 is up on the website and readable for everyone, our 
campus cluster has just switched to SSH only transfers so things are a 
little chaotic.  The only change has to do with <zil> mode input and using 
the NO_RESPONSES input type where it wasn't handled correctly, now it 
is.  If for instance you tried to use <IncrementIfNoResponse> with <zil> it 
wouldn't detect it, now it does.  I'm hoping that there wasn't some subtle 
feature that relied on the incorrect behavior...

Hi everyone.

I have recently been exposed to DMDX and am trying to write a file to play
video's to participants in fMRI scanners. I can do this but am wondering
whether its possible to freeze the video on its last frame so that it does
not disappear.

It was suggested to me to make the last frame a bmp and to simply place it
after the video, but the problem with this is that the video would appear to
'flicker'. Is it possible to access DirectDraw's functions in a DMDX file?

Also, I can play AVI  (  <DV> "example1"/;  ) and MPEG (   <DV>
"example2.mpeg"/;  took me ages to figure that out   ) but my computer
blatently refuses to play MOV files. Do you have to setup this feature
manually in DirectX (file associations etc)?

I would be grateful for any help, Andy.

   To limited extent you can play a specified number of frames within an 
AVI file but I haven't exposed the ability to pause a video.  I suspect 
even if I did it's support isn't widely implemented.  However leaving the 
last frame on the screen is possible to do in theory, I don't know whether 
DMDX's code will allow it but each of those frames that DMDX displays is a 
buffer that it has, it's conceivable that that could get fed into the 
normal DMDX display routines, but that's complicated as hell (read: you're 
gonna be compensating me to do it).

   You probably have to install QuickTime.

Hello,

Do I need to assume that one tic is added to every frame within an item
line (including those that don't present an image file, such as sending
digital IO or adding a variable ITI)?

So, if I'm presenting a bitmap file for one tic, is it really on the screen
for two tics? Therefore, if I want to display an image for one tic, should
'%0' rather than '%1' be used? 

Thanks,

Keo

   No, that's one extra tick at the end of the item for scheduling and so 
forth.

   If it is the last frame of an item yes, it will be up for two ticks 
because nothing erases it till the next item.  Given the following item 
file the display would be as follows:

d10 f30 <cr>
0 "first" / "second";
1 "third";

   "first" for 30 ticks
   "second" for 1 tick as DMDX determines this is the end of the item
   "second" for 10 ticks
   "third"

Thanks. However, if I have a frame delimiter: '/' at the end of the image,
as in:

0 "first" / "second"/;

then does this ensure the stimulus duration for "second" is what is specified?

Does the extra tic then get added to the interstimulus interval instead
of to the duration of "second"?


Thanks again.

   Oops, yesterday's update went out with the 2.4.06 version number instead 
of the 2.4.07 number it should have had, sorry.  Regardless I fixed a 
couple of other things that were pissing *me* off for a change as opposed 
to fixing things that were pissing other people off.

   First was the digital video crash that would occur if DMDX couldn't find 
the specified digital video file, the fix I applied months ago only exposed 
another crash, they're both fixed now.

   Second was making DMDX deal with the infernal Word "smart quotes" 
feature that somehow got turned on on my machine at home and has been 
irritating me every time I go to test someone's item file problem for some 
time.  This has the potential to screw things up royally as it interprets 
the RTF control codes \'93 and \'94 as double quotes, which is fine if 
every ANSI font on the face of the planet has quote characters as the 147th 
and 148th characters but I have no way of knowing whether this is in fact 
the case.  Users of fonts with lots of control words in them (like the 
asian fonts) might want to test whether their item files still parse 
correctly or whether DMDX instead complains of missing quotes.

I was wondering if anyone could help me with the following error msg:

"Set Display Mode failed!
DDER-INVALID MODE (88760078)
DirectDraw does not support the requested mode"

I am using a Matrox ME G450 Dualhead video card on Windows 98. I have also 
played around with the monitor's properties (screen area and colour) to 
match with the selected video mode, but i don't really know what i'm 
doing...any ideas?

thanks for your time,

<ZillionEnterKey> should work I think.

As I remember you need to make sure you use the <zil> output file type, 
make sure the feedback is displayed on the screen, and use <ContinuousRun>.

Hi Jonathan,

I would appreciate if you could unsubscribe us manually. Somehow we were not
successful in trying to do so automatically, as you suggested. We had sent
mail with word unsubscribe in a body of letter and received following mail:

   Two things occur to me.  First is that I've noticed that the secondary 
display on my Matrox G450 does not enumerate any 8 bit display modes at 
all.  The primary has them but secondary does not.  The default display 
mode for DMDX is 640x480x8, an 8 bit display mode.  So if you intend to use 
the secondary display you will always have to have a <VideoMode> keyword in 
your item files.

   The only other thing that's possible is that you have an invalid <vm> in 
your item file, that or the mundane things like you haven't timed a video

   Hmm, the bit pasted on the end didn't go through.  Guess the terminally 
stupid listserv engine considers a period by itself to be the end of the

Tom,

I recommend running Windows 98 or ME rather than NT... DirectX will have 
far more control over the timings, and I am not sure that the CIO/DIO 24 
will work with Windows NT.   It will most certainly have more temporal 
jitter with NT than it will with Windows 98.  I'd start over with a fresh 
install of Windows 98 on computer, making sure that you have all of the 
drivers specific to the motherboard, video card, monitor, etc... Do a clean 
install, and do not install other programs besides DMDX... this is the 
safest, and will give you the fewest problems.

Please make sure to read the help file, as well as browsing the thread of 
the listserv.... it will take you a week or so to get things up and 
running, but doing it right from the beginning will pay off in spades.

cheers,

John

   Thanks for borking the list up there, kindly refrain from sending

I've kinda cracked the freezing video requirement. For some reason, the code
below allows a video to be played and then keeps the last frame on screen
until the subject responds...
does not work all the time though (a quirk of my hardware?).

   As I think about this issue a bit more I recall it's actually a little 
difficult for DMDX to determine when a video is going to stop playing so 
there is a bit of chicanery going on when a video stops playing and DMDX 
returns to normal frame display.  My guess is you are somehow managing to 
snot that chicanery.

Apologies to DMDX List subscribers if you received a 6 MB attachment from 
<tomc@psychology.leeds.ac.uk>. The offending file is called "directx60nt.exe".

Please note the following:

1. Any message you send with the address <DMDX@psy1.psych.arizona.edu> goes 
to *everyone* on the list.

2. You should avoid attachments (especially 6 MB attachments), since this 
puts a lot of people over their quota. Large attachments also run a 
significant chance of crashing the list server.

3. The *only* things you should include in your posting are relevant 
extracts from your .rtf file, or copies of error messages from DMDX. These 
should go in the body of the message.

4. If it is absolutely critical that you get advice about a larger file 
(e.g., a .wav file), then send it to a specific person, *not* the list. 
Also, ask that person whether they need to see the file before you send it.

    Dear Sir/Madam,

    I've been trying to set up a dot-probe task and am having a problem 
    with using DMDX. Please would someone be so kind as to shed 
    some light on this problem? What I'm trying to do is let any 
    response on one trial to cause the next trial to begin, whilst still 
    measuring RTs.

    So a fixation cross is presented centrally for c.500 msec, followed 
    by two images to the left and right of the fixation cross for c.33 or 
    c.100 msec. These images are then replaced by two mask images 
    and then both of the mask images disappear. One of the mask 
    images is replaced by a probe image (either an upward or a 
    downward arrow). What I'm aiming to do is let the probe image stay 
    on the screen until a response is made (either the key t (upward 
    arrow) or g(downward arrow)). 

    With <cr> and <ntl>, as used below, one response allows the 
    onset of the next trial and the next trial does not begin until a 
    response has been made. However, the duration of the probe 
    seems to inherit that of the mask image, when it is intended that 
    the probe stay visible until a response is made.  Also, RTs are 
    replaced with 1.00 instead. Please would someone be so kind as 
    to shed some light on this problem? 

    The code is below. There is a second version at the very end that 
    has had all the <bmp> commands deleted so stimuli occur as text 
    instead. I can provide .txt versions of files if this is easier.

    Best regards,

    Tom Campbell.

Hi.  I have discovered a problem with the geForce2 MX card, which is not 
solved by using the -buffers 4 extension to DMDX.exe but to no effect.

When displaying a bitmap image it wraps the image i.e. it splits the image 
displays the left half the image on the right hand side and vice 
versa.  This problem happened with the old NVIDIA cards but was solved by 
downloading the NVIDIA Detonator reference driver.  However with this does 
not seem to solve the problem for the new geForce2 MX card.

Has anyone else had this problem?

- Mike

   Nope, that's a new one on me.  If you care to send the bitmap to me 
(jforster@u.arizona.edu) I'll see what it does on our machines.

   After thinking about it for a bit there are several things you can 
do.  First is to try TimeDX's select video mode and tell it to display a 
bitmap instead of a font.  Next thing to try is to use a few different 
display modes and see if things change.  Last work around is to convert the 
bitmap to a .JPG and display that instead (in DMDX, TineDX can't read .JPG 
files).
   I really can't see how NVIDIA's drivers could be affecting the display 
of a bitmap, as the code that reads and prepares a bitmap all occurs in 
DMDX and has very little to do with any win32 drivers at all.

I'm generating an unexpected error in DMDX:

could not find registry key <SOFTWARE\Timedx\2\0 Primary Display
Driver\640x480(480)_8bpp_0Hz

I have run TimeDX2 (advanced tests and selected the video mode), saving
values associated with 800,600,600,16 in the registry (per the messages
from TimeDX2).

This is the parameter line that generates the above error:

<ep>N1000<vm 800 600 600 16 0><azk><ofp 0><cr>f18<t 2000><id
"keyboard"><zil><zor> <vzk +Numpad 1><vzk +Numpad 2><vzk +Numpad 3><vzk
+Numpad 4> <dbc 0><dwc 255255255><nfbt></ep>

I get the same error when I use commas in the video mode parameter.

Let me know if you need any additional info, and thanks,  -Michael

Do you not need commas between the numbers in the vm parameter?

   Not likely, DMDX is trying to find the 640x480x8 key.  Actually I've 
just figured out what it is, I saw this some time ago on one of our 
machines.  Turns out that even if you specified that you were going to use 
800x600x16 or whatever the code needed to get the default video settings 
anyway, 640x640x8, so you need to time that video mode regardless of 
whether you ever intend to use it or not.  I never noticed the error 
because of course I had always timed 640x480x8 anyway.  ISTR correcting 
this and indeed I can't replicate your trouble here so I suspect your 
trouble stems from using an old version of DMDX.

Jonathon,
I am trying to display two bitmaps simultaneously, but they merely flash
on the screen (it's self-paced, so it should stay on the screen until a
timeout).  I am receiving an error "XXX ms of refused video flip
occurred".  I cannot figure out why I'm receiving this error message
now, because it is virtually the same as another script than runs just
fine (same computer, same experimental trials, no changes in
presentation duration, same # of trials)--just font change (times new
roman to arial) and some new control files (same size as before)..  I've
looked at the suggestions in the DMDX help and in the archives, but I'm
wondering if there's some error in my script that I cannot pinpoint, as
opposed to hardware issues, since the original script works fine.  My
computer has NVIDIA TNT 2 M64 4XAGP video card, 128 MB RAM, and the
image file sizes range from 40 to 80 Kb, so I think this should be
sufficient.   Any advice would be appreciated.
Thanks,
Scott

Dear all,
I'm having problems with the subject response timeout command. My =
experiment is set such that subjects would have 4 seconds to respond <t =
4000>. This works for the items (i.e. "No Response" appears on the =
screen after 4 seconds have elapsed) up until when the subject has =
responded under 4 seconds. So, as soon as a response is made within the =
timelimit (4 seconds), all the following items do not have a timeout =
limit, and one can take as long as one likes. Is this a bug in the DMDX =
program? But with my other experiment on DMDX the timeout command is =
working fine. Please help! The parameter lines for my experiment are as =
follows:=20

A related question is that what if I don't want a timeout limit, but =
still want to record response times (I've tried using <ntl> , the no =
time limit command, but this would not record RTs). So what's the =
command for no time limit, but with RTs still being recorded?

Thanks in anticipation,

So what's the command for no time limit, but with RTs still being recorded?

Try <ntl 0>.

Dear All,

Please excuse the naivety of my question from a DMDX novice: My stimulus =

coloured black; the square changes at 2.5 second delay intervals. My =
question is how do I get the grid to appear continuously as a background =

   <ntl> is what you want (not <ntl 0> which would turn of NoTimeLimit), 
you must have another error in your item file.

   Hmm, all I can think if is that the extra frame you are presenting has 
pushed your item's frame count over the amount of memory that the video 
card can buffer and therefore DMDX is moving a frame into memory as the 
item is executing.  1024x768x16 is a fairly intensive video mode, each 
frame consumes  1.5meg of video memory, you have to have one frame for the 
previous display, one for "WHICH..., one for your merged graphics and one 
for the erase frame using at least 6.2meg which is getting close if your 
video card only has 8meg of memory.  Perhaps you should look at the initial 
diagnostics from DMDX where it displays how many video buffers you have, it 
may only have 3 back buffers in which case there's you explanation.
   Kind of disappointing to see a TNT2 toss up refused flips, I thought 
they were better that that.  You can try reducing the maximum lines to blit 
in TimeDX when timing that mode as the problem probably stems from the 
blitter blocking everything else.  If that doesn't get it start reducing 
the Sleep Time as this will start DMDX tying to flip the video pages 
earlier and thus have a longer for the card to finally accept the command 
to flip pages.

   BTW, a 40kb JPG can easily expand to a 1meg image...

Another interesting interaction with the new version came up this morning.
For a couple of experiments, we have numerous images, and organize them
into subdirectories below the directory where the RTF file for the
experiment is located. We've previously displayed the image calls like
this:

 ... <jpg> "subdirectory\image" ...

And this worked quite fine. With the new version of DMDX, same directory
structure, same images, I was getting an "unable to open" message. So I
tried the following change:

... <jpg> "subdirectory/image" ...

And everything worked again. Since everything is working, it's not really
a problem, just interesting.

   Weird, I wouldn't expect a forward slash to work at all.

   Perhaps you just changed something in Word and it's deciding to use some 
stupid control sequence for a backslash that DMDX doesn't recognize?

Helen,

What's that '$' in the parameter line doing there?  Is that meant to be a 
switch for the scramble routines?  I have no idea what that would do, but 
it should go after the parameter line.

I now realise it wasn't the <ntl 0> but the <t 5000000> that 
removed the time limit. I guess this pushes the time limit through 
the roof so there is practically no time limit. This seems to be me 
holding my code together with a bottle top though. Still confused 
as to why with <ntl> alone I don't get RTs but 1.00 and +1.00 
instead, but without <ntl> or using <ntl 0> I do get RTs.

This seems to work, <ntl 0> of no functional consequence on this 
occasion:

I discovered it by accident, having not fully moved my head from Unix
before starting to work on DMDX this morning. I don't think the problem is
in Word, since I use a scripting program to generate the script file, then
open it in Wordpad (or Notepad)  and save it as RTF. -Michael

   My bad.  <ntl> is supposed to just report -1 or 1 for RTs, <t 5000000> 
is what you want.

   Perhaps you could consider posting just a part of your item file next time?

   Hmm, well I haven't changed anything I can think of that would affect 
that.  Is the name of the file as reported in the error message formed 
correctly?

Dear All,
I'm still having problems with the timeout function and can't work out why.
My experiment, in short, is that the participant hears a Chinese word (and
sees the face pronouncing that word at the same time) and then is required
to identify the word from 6 choices displayed at the bottom of the screen.
The problem I'm having is that the timeout limit of 4 seconds does not seem
to be working. It works initially but as soon as a response (regardless of
whether it's correct or not) is made, all the following items do not have a
timeout limit and the participant can take as long as s/he likes to respond.
The parameter lines and three item lines are as follows:

<ep> f100 m110 <s 24> <g 1> <t 4000> <id "keyboard"> <n 144> <dbc 0> <dwc

Thanks very much for the response to my question, but I'm afraid I didn't
give enough detail in my question to make it answerable! Could I try
again...

My task involves a yes/no response on each presentation of an 8x8 square
grid with a
black square in one of the locations (stimulus duration = 1000ms); 2000ms
delay between each stimulus. The location of the black square changes on
each stimulus presentation. The way I have the file set up currently is as
follows:

(on my machine, 1 tick = 17ms)
... <fd 59> <t 2000> <d 10> ...

-100 *<bmp> "grid1" / <% 106> /;
-101 *<bmp> "grid2" / <% 106> /;
+200 *<bmp> "grid3" / <% 106> /;
etc...

In this case, each of the 'grid' bmp files contain the 8x8 grid, and a black
square covering one of the locations on the grid (the location of the black
square is different in grid1, grid2, etc). The problem is that at the end of
each line, of course the grid, and the square, disappear during the delay
period, which is disorientating; so I only want the square to
disappear for the specified delay period, whilst a blank grid remains
throughout. Is it possible to code a blank grid as a separate .bmp file ,
which is either set as a background in some way, or is repeated on each line
when the square disappears, to give the impression of a continuous grid
background?

Thanks very much for your help,

Garry

<excerpt>I understand that DMDX can now handle .jpg format, but I'm
having a few problems in getting my files to be recognised. I'm using

DMDX reports the error:

The code runs fine when substituting .jpg for .bmp files, and both sets
of files are located in the same directory. Do I need to put something in
the parameter line for the files to be recognised?

  

Any help much appreciated,

Hi Garry,


I think that you need to use a more recent version of DMDX. Jpeg support
was only added in DMDX version 2.30. 


Send me an email off-list and I can help you to upgrade.

   Works for me.  When I cut and paste your itemfile and comment out all 
the <wav> and <dv> keywords I get the names of the files displayed and then 
4 seconds later get "No Response" for each of the items.  Perhaps you 
should try the same on your machine.  If you get the correct behavior we 
must have some nasty thing having to do with the fact that you're using 
sound and digital video files.  If that's the case then you'll have to send 
me some of the files at jforster@email.arizona.edu.  Don't send more than 
20meg, the account won't take it.  If the six files in question for that 
demo item are bigger than 20meg I'll have to think of something else.

   Ooo, just had an idea.  You're using a regular clockon in a digital 
video frame, something that while possibly correct I don't think has been 
done before.  There's a special <DVClockon>:

   And you still want feedback?  If you used <nfb> then your item structure 
would be:

-100 *<bmp> "grid1" / <% 106> / <bmp> "blankgrid";

   If you want feedback then you'll have to code your own feedback routine 
that leaves a grid up in the same fashion, see:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhbranchkeyword.htm

   Your itemfile would be something closer to:

<nfb> <fd 59> <t 2000> <d 10>
0 "Custom Feedback Example" <bu 100>;
10 d0 <biw 20> c;
0 d20  "correct", <bmp> "blankgrid" <return>;
20 d0 <binr 30> c;
0 d20  "wrong", <bmp> "blankgrid" <return>;
30 d20  "noresponse", <bmp> "blankgrid" <return>;

-100 *<bmp> "grid1" / <% 106> / <call -10> c;

Hi all.

Im having problems with a video expt. I want a video to be shown, followed
by a bmp picture. The video's last frame generally disappears after it has
played, but sometimes it does not! Does anyone know how to make it disappear
every single time? A snippet of my code is given below:

   Well if you want the video erased why are you specifying that the frames 
after the video aren't to be erasing what's on the screen?  In any event, 
video is a different beast, it's not known about by the regular drawing 
routines so a non-erase symbol after video is a pretty much undefined 
action.  Typically I would not be trying to display something immediately 
after a digital video frame, it's difficult to tell exactly when the last 
frame of the video is displayed (and it's displayed by a completely 
different set of routines than the normal DMDX display routines) and so 
having DMDX toss a regular frame up right after it is problematical.  I 
would suggest something like the following:

+1 <ms% 500> "Ready?" / <ms% 2000> / * <dv> "cf200.avi" / %5 /! <bmp> 
"blank.bmp"
/!  <ms% 500> / <bmp> <x 0.24> <y 0.75> "Pleasant";

   To be on the ultra safe side I'd split them into to items:

+1 <ms% 500> "Ready?" / <ms% 2000> / * <dv> "cf200.avi" ;
+11 d5 <bmp> "blank.bmp" /!  <ms% 500> / <bmp> <x 0.24> <y 0.75> "Pleasant";

I'm presenting 4 bitmap files in succession in each item line with each
delimited by forward slashes, so the number of tics that each is displayed
for *should* be limited to what is specified for each frame. In looking
at the successive clock-on times for each trial, I'm getting an extra tic
(16.67 ms) every few trials that is not accounted for by the script. 

Where is this extra tic likely to be coming in between COTs? 

Can I be sure it's not coming from the duration for one of my bitmap files?

The study is designed to measure the effect of showing the target stimulus
at 4 durations of either 1, 2, 4 or 8 tics, so we have to be sure the bitmap
is on the screen for these specified times. 

Thanks for your help.

   Have you looked that the diagnostics to see if there are any display 
errors?  Unfortunately DMDX was designed long before fMRI was available 
here and people wanted rigidly controlled total item file durations and so 
when it detects that a display error has occurred it reschedules everything 
yet to be displayed forward in time by however much the error was for.

Hi DMDX users,
	I have a trial I have setup that uses text and sound.  Currently the sound 
is synced to the text but we would like to change that so that the sound 
and text each appear at different (variable) rates.

I currently can do this by changing the offset for each WAV file with 
respect to the text so that the sound is at its rate and the text is at a 
different rate but its all manual.  As an example we would like the text 
blocks to appear at 4 second intervals but the sounds to start at 3.5 
second intervals.  It was easy enough to do but as we now want to explore 
changing the sound and text rates I have to recode a lot of item files or 
find a way of specifying the sound rate separately from the text rate.

I am not looking forward to coding 15*15 item files that are exactly the 
same except for the frame duration and offsets of the sounds.

Suggestions and advice would be appreciated.

   You have a number of choices, however both will still require edits of 
any given item file, however such edits will be limited to the first couple 
of lines.  You can either use macros that expand to the various frame 
durations or you can use counters and the <ctr%> keyword.

Whether an entire item line or even a frame is delayed seems to be a separate
issue from what I'm trying to determine. What I'd like to know for now is
if the duration of a bitmap file within a single frame delimited by forward
slashes and given a specific number of tics to be displayed is still being
shown on the screen for that specified number of tics, or whether that display
time could be an extra tic in length when it shouldn't be. 

Thanks,

Keo

   Unless an error is logged no, the duration of a frame regardless of 
whether it's text or a bitmap is what it is specified to be.  What would be 
the point of the program otherwise?  The only extra tic that exists is when 
rigid ISI control is turned on with the D parameter and the subject is not 
determining the length of the item with his/her response.  That tic exists 
as DMDX looks in the display queue after the last frame has been displayed 
and finds no more frames to display and thus that time is used as the end 
of the item and the next item's frames are scheduled from that time.  But 
that tic should be present in every single item, any fluctuation you are 
getting between items must either be attributable to a display error caused 
by either having poor video timing parameters or a poor video card (in 
which case you would see them in the log file diagnostics.txt) or 
attributable to some item file design issue.  Item file design issues 
include using things like the duration of a wave file to determine a 
frame's duration, but even then the error should be constant across runs of 
DMDX.  The most obvious cause of random variations in an otherwise rigidly 
controlled item file is to have the subject reaction time out set longer 
than the display duration of an item, in that fashion as long as the 
subject is responding within the duration of the display the timing will be 
as you expect.  If however a subject doesn't respond or responds within the 
timeout but that timeout is much longer than the display's duration then 
you will get random fluctuations in total item file duration.  And then of 
course there is the X factor, you've discovered some new combination of 
things that breaks DMDX's timing, but that's not likely.

My experience with DMDX is measured in tens of minutes and is limited to
running TimeDX and the demos.

I need to set up experiments involving the measurement of reaction times to
both visual and audio stimuli with audio warning tones preceeding some of
the visual cue presentations  (This is a covert orienting paradigm based on
the work of Fernandez-Duque, D. and M.I. Posner, Relating the mechanisms of
orienting and alerting. Neuropsychologia, 1997. 35(4): p. 477-86).

An example of one event could be written in meta code this way:
  type==1                                                        /* trial
type #1, visual stimulus only */
  present fixation point                                    /*  white a
small white cross at the center of the screen  */
  present visual stimulus  at location X,Y            /*  write a small
white circle at location X,Y*/
  wait either 150 or 450 msec
  present target at Xt,Yt                                  /* present a
target next to the cue or at some other location */
  wait up to 1500 msec for response                 /* time the interval
between the target presentation and button press */
        if no response (response_time == -1)
  write response time and type to datafile
  clear the screen or black out cue and target     /* don't want any flashes
in fixation point as new screen redraws */
  wait ISI                                                           /*
Inter Stimulus Interval random time between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds */
Actually, I want to also send 'flags' to a digital output port or LPT port
for synchronization with a physiological recording (think: event related
potentials) .

/* QUESTION BEGINS HERE! */

So, I ask, how am I going to best learn coding in DMDX?  Is the DMASTR
manual the most coherent reference source for programming DMDX or is there a
logical outline to follow in the DMDX online help pages that I have not
seen?

Can anyone suggest a DMDX script which contains elements of the task I am
undertaking?

Thank you ever so much!

Problems using DMDX?

      There are several tutorials available:

           Matt Davis's DMDX Tutorial.
           Ken's DM/DMTG Tutorial.

   After you've read the tutorials, yes, everything you want is perfectly 
possible including outputting codes to other machines although making the 
wrong RT -1 is a little advanced, by default you get -timelimit for wrong 
responses.  But you have to come up with the first approximation.

   I've added a new keyword in 2.4.09:

Media Life Keyword

<MediaLife N>
<ml N>

     Switch to override the default time that DMDX buffers media. N is the 
number of items to keep this media in memory for.
     By default if a piece of media (<wav>, <jpeg>, <bmp>, <dv>, or <sa>) 
is not used again in the next item DMDX releases the
resources used to load that piece of media (an N of 1), if an item file 
however repeatedly uses that media but with intervening items this
keyword can be used to extend the time before DMDX releases those 
resources. Originally this was not included because I figured that
the disk cache that win32 automatically maintains would keep load times 
trivial, however if an item file requires a really demanding
<delay> parameter <ml> can lower the minimum delay that might otherwise be 
possible. Using this keyword will lower Preparation A
times after the media has been used once, it will not affect the 
preparation B times however.

I want to insert RTF code to write a specific ASCII character directly into
the item file (as opposed to pasting the character itself into WordPad)

Using WordPad or Word I can insert the appropriate character at the size I
want (a 72 point dot) in the item file and the RTF coding looks like this:

        1 <ms% 3000>  <xy 0.5, 0.5>  "+",  <ms% 3000> <XY 0.2, 0.2>
"\f1\fs144\'b7\f0\fs22 " /;  \par

        e.g.,  font # 1, font size 144 half-points, character b7 (hex)


Is there some way to explicitly write the codes: \f1  \fs144 \'b7 into the
item file?  Why, because I have written a program to generate all the random
sequences and parameters for cue and target stimuli presentations (location
on screen and duration) in text format and I can't utilize special
characters.

True, I could/can/will? simply write 'CUE_symbol' and 'TARGET_symbol' in the
original text and then while I have the file open in WORD to save it in RTF
format, Replace 'CUE_symbol' with the desired graphic symbol.  But why make
life simple? :)

Thank you,

I want to present a stimulus and move on to the next frame immediately after
the response, or patiently wait 2000 msec for a missed response before
moving on.

My attempts to follow suggestions of NoTimeLimit uses from past posts
(e.g.,http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/DMDX/thread?message=2065994)
were not successful.

Any suggestions?

Thanks

   I suspect you are going to use the answer you gave because the only 
other way to do it is to have your program generate the entire RTF file and 
that while complicated is no mean feat.

Sorry to bother you all but I can't seem to get the right scrambling sorted
out in my expt.  I have two practice blocks of 8 items that I do NOT want
scrambled and these two blocks need to stay in this order.  Then six blocks
of 16 items that i do want scrambled within each block but I want the order
of the blocks to remain the same.  I have read the scrambling notes and
tutorials but can't seem to find the right answer.  Is this possible to do?

I have  <s 16> and <g 1> in the command line, but I think my problem is an
overuse of $s.

Thanks

We have recently discovered a peculiar incompatibility between the Matrox
G450 video card and dmdx.  It goes like this:
Dmdx displays properly to a monitor on either the primary or secondary output
of the G450 card.  However, dmdx's timing is VERY VERY messed up when it
displays to svideo.  Neither driver nor bios upgrades to the card have helped.

I would very much appreciate it if anyone out there could name a high end
AGP card with lots of memory (32 or 64?) on board that they KNOW correctly
displays DMDX to a secondary svideo output.

Thankyou,

Hi fellow DMDX users.

I'm trying to set up an experiment that consists of pairs of critical
items, and if either of the items within a pair are responded to
incorrectly I would like that pair of items to be repeated randomly
between the other pairs at some later time.  I'm assuming this would
require the call or branch keywords, but I have yet to come up with a
working script.  Does anyone have any previous experience with this, or
any ideas on how I might accomplish this?

Thanks-
Shannon


   You will have to use both counters and branches, to make life easier 
using a call to a subroutine is probably more appropriate.  Initially 
you'll want to set some counters up, one for each possible stimulus you 
might want to re-present and set them to zero.  You'll want to setup a 
subroutine in which you'll branch based on the counter's value over the 
items to present that stimulus, using for example <bicLE>, you'll also want 
to branch over them based on the random number branch <birnLE> -- which 
means there will be a chance that that item won't get presented 
again.  When you present the stimuli initially  if the subject responds 
incorrectly you'll want to set the corresponding counter to 1 (so the 
subroutine will re-present that stimuli).  Additionally the re-presenting 
subroutine will want to set that counter back to zero when it does 
re-present that stimulus.  The you'll want to call that routine at every 
place you might like to re-present some stimuli.

   Actual code will look something like the following:

<!parameters> f30
0 d0 c <!setup the counters and skip the subroutine>
   <set 1,0> <set 2,0> <bu 1000>;

100 d0 c <!re-presentation subroutine> <bicLE 1,0,110>;
0 d0 c <!skip this 50% of the time> <birnLE 499,110>;
0 d0 c <set 1,0>;
+101 "re-present item 1" * <return>;
110 d0 c <bicLE 2,0,120>
0 d0 c <!skip this 50% of the time> <birnLE 499,120>;
0 d0 c <set 2,0>;
+102 "re-present item 2" * <return>;
120 <return>;

1000 "instructions";
+1001 "item 1" * <inciw 1> <call -100>;
+1002 "item 2" * <inciw 2> <call -100>;



   If the random probability isn't nice you could expand the subroutine 
that gets called so that it randomly incremented a counter a couple of 
times and change the re-presentation to decrement the counter (once it's 
been detected as non-zero) and only re-present the stimuli if that counter 
then goes back to zero:

<!parameters> f30
0 d0 c <!setup the counters and skip the subroutine>
   <set 1,0> <set 2,0> <bu 1000>;

100 d0 c <set 1000,0> <bic 100>;
! now our subroutine either re-presents if response was right otherwise
   it sets up a counter for the main items to store in the respective
   counter;
10 <inc 1000> <birnLE 499,10>;
10 <inc 1000> <birnLE 499,10>;
10 <inc 1000> <birnLE 499,10>;
10 <inc 1000> <return>;

100 d0 c <!re-presentation subroutine> <bicLE 1,0,110>;
0 d0 c <dec 1> <bicGT 1,0,110>;
+101 "re-present item 1" * <return>;
110 d0 c <bicLE 2,0,120>
0 d0 c <dec 2> <bicGT 2,0,120>;
+102 "re-present item 2" * <return>;
120 <return>;

1000 "instructions";
+1001 "item 1" * <inciw 1> <call -100>;
0 d0 c <set 1,counter1000>;
+1002 "item 2" * <inciw 2> <call -100>;
0 d0 c <set 2,counter1000>;

Hi DMDXers
         I have been using a task where we have sound and text displayed at 
different rates.  I need to have the text appear at one rate and the sounds 
at another.  This is so the two stimulus are not synchronised and contain 
different stimulus at the same rate (according to the principle investigator).

I asked the list this before and Jonathan said:
>At 02:52 28/07/2001, j.c.f. wrote:

Unfortunately I am not the greatest DMDX user and cannot get this to 
work.  Currently I use item files that contain something like:

0 <wav> "sound1"/%109 "text 1"/
   <wav> "sound2" <svp start> %13/  %109 "text 2"/
   <wav> "sound3" <svp start> %26/ %109 "text 3"/
   <wav> "sound4" <svp start> %39/ %109 "text 4/
...

This gives an output with the sound blocks starting at a slightly (1/4 
second) faster rate then the text.  The problem is I need to change the 
task to make it more time variable.  We want to change the text rate and 
sound rate for each trial.  I could code all the possible combinations (not 
fun) or find a way of doing it by a single change at the start.  I started 
writting a VB front end to but I'm stuck working out how the change is 
limited to "the first couple of lines".

I am sure Jonathan had an idea what to do but I am not sure if I should be 
doing it completely differently or just missing something simple.

Thanks in advance

I am still suffering from the inescapable (?) beginners struggle with what
must be a classic 'hello world' type program.

(1)  In a reaction time test ('press button after presentation of target') -
I want the frame to end immediately after the 'reaction' button press.

The example below does not function as desired.  The frame does not
terminate upon a key press, rather it remains displayed for the full 2
seconds (default trial time).  In the actual test, the latencies to target
presentation and ISI's are varied from trial to trial so the waits must be

As for problem one, just remove the frame delimiter at the end of each

   Alas, build a tool that a fool can use and only a fool will want to use 
it.  DMDX is unfortunately an "in extremis" example of this aphorism.

   I would have said your construction was correct although specifying the 
duration of a frame that ends in a comma is superfluous, assuming the 
obvious ungrammatical > just an artifact of your cutting and pasting it 
should be:

         ^2 <ms% 1000> <xy 0.5, 0.5> "+" / <wav> "beep.wav" <svp start> /
                 *  <xy 0.5, 0.5> "+" ,  <ms% 2000> <xy 0.2, 0.2> "target";

   I am surprised to hear that there is a blink where you say it is, audio 
frames don't have a visual component.  You're sure it's not some feedback 
being displayed?  I don't notice any <nfb> in your parameter line.

Hello,

Thank you everyone for your help in getting me on my feet over the past few
days.  I have a functional covert orienting experiment developed in DMDX and
am quite pleased with the process.

I do have a question however that relates to the error messages I am seeing
when I run the program.  The help file section on 'common errors' explains
that my 'Display errors' may be ameanable to tweaking of the sleep times and
page bliting parameters.  I have cut down the sleep to 5 (from 13) and
blitting to 100 (from 200) without benefit.  Without knowing what I am
doing, further tweaking is more blind trial and error than I prefer.

Do these errors really amount to anything in my application (i.e., can I
ignore them?)

I am displaying black and white text symbols at 600 x 800, 8 bits on an 8MB
ATI Rage-Pro display card.  DirectX v. 8.   I am networked and have not
disabled file and resource sharing (yet).

Thanks,

Derek

 Dear Sir/Madam
 
 I have a query concerning PIO and how to get timedx to set up a 
 button box effectively. I would be grateful for any advice.
 
 I have acquired a CIO-DIO24/24H I/O card that I intend to use to
 interface with a button box of the design specified in PIO test help
 and to output a signal to some equipment for ERP recordings. The
 button box has been wired into pin 18, 35, 36 and 37 together with pin
 19.
 
 I notice that this I/O card model only has 7 switches to specify the
 base address. These are labelled 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7.  The switches are
 labelled up and down. 
 
 When the board was supplied these were set as follows:
 
 1(on)  	2(on)  	3(off) 	4(off)  	5(off)  	6(off)  	7(off)
 
 Assuming when a switch is off then it contributes to the hex version of an address,
this corresponds to 300h and the instacal digital internal and 
 external tests work fine with the base address set in this way. 
 
 TimedX does not recognise the PIO as installed however, in that it is
 not listed as a device by the input test. But when I attempt to reset
 the base address to 310h by,
 
 1(on)  	2(on)  	3(off)  	4(off)  	5(off)  	6(off)  	7(off)

 then this situation, whereby the input test does not recognise the
 existence of PIO prevails.

I considered the possibility that the base address of the parallel port may
be the same but this is 888decimal that I take to be 380h.

Is there something that I need to do with directx?
Is there something I need to install other than directx and 
DMDX/timedx? I notice that there directx's diagnostic tool input 
section has no input devices visible. Moreover, there is only a driver 
for the joystick.

Or please, do you have any other ideas?

Best wishes,

I'm having problem with random selection.
My case is like the following...
In study phase there are 10 items for each category.
But I only wanted to show 4 items in the test phase.
What should I do?
Sorry to bother with such simple problem
Thanks.

   There's not much more parameter tweaking you can do, lowering the Sleep 
times is the major thing, chopping the Blit Time in half is also a good thing.

   Depends how much it matters to you that the "." frame is presented one 
tick (in your case 13.35ms) longer than you intended.

   You could try a 16 bit color mode, I'm seeing more and more drivers 
perform better with the RGB display versus the palette that comes with 8 
bit modes.  Other than that your up against the hardware.  You could try 
going to ATI's web page and downloading newer drivers, if you've got a VIA 
chipset the the latest 4in1 drivers are a very good idea.  Short of those 
working though it's pretty much a case of pulling different components out 
of the machine and seeing if the video card suddenly gets better or trying 
a different video card.

   Not unless it's a PCI card.  If you have no success changing the card's 
base address change the base address that TimeDX and DMDX use to 300.

   The PIO has nothing to do with DirectX.  If it did things would be gravy 
but there are no DirectX drivers for the PIO.

   If blocking items together is no particular concern you can always use 
S1.  Should your S10 really matter you can always bulk out the test phase 
with groups of 6 filler items to make the scrambling balance.  I typically use:

0 d0 ! %0 c;

Thank you for the advice.

I've tried this but to no avail. It is a Computerboards CIO-
DIO24/24H, that was formerly known as CIO-DIO48. This is 
alledgedly plug-and-play, but it downloads something from a CD 
that comes with the board, that includes the instacal package to 
test if it is intalled right. I do not think this is a PCI card. It seems 
to be correctly installed when the base address is set to 300h. 

Please do you have any other suggestions as to what the problem 
may be?

Curiously the first time that I select PIO test on each loading of 
timedx, when I click start the tick boxes for output bits turn white 
and all the values in the right column turn to high. Whether I click 
stop then save the done or save then stop then done or start then 
done, this has no effect. Clicking start for a second time afterwards 
all the right column remains as questionmarks.

Best regards,

Tom.

Is there a list of DMDX 'approved' PIO boards?  The ongoing configuration
problems that one of the posters is having makes me want to be certain of
the PIO board I am about to buy.

(1)  Does anyone use the Advantech PCL-724 PIO card ? (e.g.,
http://www.advantech.com/products/pdf/PCL-724.pdf)

(2)  Are PCI bus PIO cards problematic under DMDX ?

(3)  When looking at a PIO board, what advertising buzzwords should we look
for?  (e.g., DirectX ?  Plus and Play ?  Operating Thetan? )

Also,  Is it neccessary to use a one-shot with a puch button switch when
'triggering' a PIO input in order to guarantee that the button press won't
be missed by the polling? (i.e., a one-shot is an electronic pulse generator
that creates a stable 10(?) ms trigger to the PIO input ).  I guess the same
question applies to joystick port switches.

There is a note in the on-line documentation about improving the response
time of mice buttons by 'shorting the axis pots'.  I want to caution that
some mice do not use pots (resistance potentiometers) but rather have rotary
optical encoders (which look like pots!).  The consequences of shorting
their terminals out would be rather different and potentially lethal to the
mouse.

We've been successfully using Keithley's KPCI-PIO24 for control of
tachistoscopic goggles and input from response boxes. We did have a little
trouble getting to the point where we could use these boards effectively,
but the tech support from Keithley was good. The board requires an
emulator for setting the IO location, and the emulator is provided with
the board. For a description of our application, see

Anthony Huang ,

         Try the following.  The way it works is that the scrambling of the 
test items goes around anything inside $...$.  However, the instruction 
after the 4th test item causes an unconditional branch to the next item 
number 0, thereby skipping the rest of the items.  Note that the 
backslashes are critical, otherwise study items and test items would get 
mixed up.

   Ah, I see what the problem is, it's not a DIO24 which is the card we use 
for I/O, you have the DIO48, there's _two_ 8255s in there.  The 
ComputerBoards site claims that the card is emulating an 8255 which is 
fine, but if there's two of them addressing can't as simple as just using 
0x300 as a base, the other device has to live somewhere else.  You'll 
either have to send me the documentation on the board or get someone 
technical to look at it and figure out why TimeDX wouldn't be working as it 
claims existing software should work without modification.  I'm pretty sure 
I've tested that TimeDX works with port bases other than 0x310 but it 
doesn't hurt to make sure that you're using the latest version of TimeDX 
anyway.

   It should work.

   They're only problematic in that a PCI device's base address can change 
when any hardware in the computer is changed so you have to keep a pretty 
close watch on it.  ISA cards are much less of a problem (assuming you have 
a motherboard with an ISA slot of course, many motherboards don't these days).

   You ever seen anyone press a key for less than a millisecond?  Given 
that most keys I've measured have mechanical activation times far in excess 
of a millisecond I don't think you'll ever miss a keypress, not with DMDX 
anyway.  Oneshots are used more to shape a pulse, they get rid of any 
bouncing as the switch is closed or released and again, most switches these 
days are very clean there too.  No, a oneshot isn't necessary.

   No, software poling eliminates the need for any electronics.

   I doubt it, there's a note about joysticks but not mice, mice never have 
pots in them.

   But your point stands, if someone bought a digital joystick that used 
optical encoders and they shorted them out things would probably go 
awry.  But I do emphasize somewhere in there to get old fashioned simple 
non-digital non-optical joysticks.  OTOH, buying a digital joystick and 
using it as is may lead to impressively low polling times anyway, most of 
those devices don't actually plug in to a joystick port anyway.

  It's (520) 621-9306, you'll have to figure out the country code.  If you

Dear jcf,

======================================================================


   It got through ok and unfortunately I don't see anything that would 
indicate the source of your problem.  It's nice of them to change the name 
of the card from a nice and clear DIO48, it having 48 I/O lines to DIO24 
when DIO24 is the name of a card that actually has 24 lines, but we'll pass 
that over.  From looking at the manual you have two 8255 devices in there, 
one at base + 0 and the other at base + 4, so if you've set the base at 
0x300 one device is at 0x300 and the other at 0x304.  TimeDX can use either 
device by changing it's base address appropriately (don't put the 0x in 
though, just the 300 or 304).

   Are you using the latest TimeDX?  IIRC there was some problem with the 
PIO base address but I'm not seeing anything in my comments so it must have 
been a real long time ago.

   The only other thing is to check your windows device manager and to list 
devices by I/O port and to see if there's something else using the 0x300 range.

Hi Petra,

I don't think that I will be much help with this. I've not spent any time
working with the innards of DMDX or Windows. I've cc-ed this reply to the
DMDX mailing list (which you can subscribe to at
dmdx-request@psy1.psych.arizona.edu). Hopefully someone more knowledge than
me will have some suggestions.

My guess is that what you're trying to achieve - that is running DMDX and
EDA recording software on the same pc - is very difficult to achieve. DMDX
can get very unhappy (producing display errors and eratic timing) if you're
trying to run other software in the background. I think that you would be
much better off using two separate PCs, one to record the electrodermal
data and one running DMDX. You can ensure that the two machines are
synchronised by getting one machine to trigger the other, either using the
joystick port or PIO-cards.

Does anyone out there with experience of electrodermal data have any
concrete suggestions on this topic?

Matt

Thank you Johnathan. The problem seems to have been that the 
addresses for the sound card were in conflict with the I/O card.  
Nonetheless the instacal program verified it was an effective install, 
despite this apparent conflict of addresses. I just stripped the 
sound card out as I don't need it for this experiment. 

The Computerboards CIO-DIO 24/24H, formerly known as CIO-
DIO48 is compatible with what is the latest version of DMDX and 
TimedX. The section of the board that is involved in 5V TTL inputs 
and outputs (not the 24H bit which are the hi drive channels) has a 
base address that corresponds to the position of the switches on 
the board. To those of you interested, the CIO-DIO24 is about half 
the price of the CIO-DIO 24/24H.

Tom.

   There is no way, DMDX uses the lowest layer of input, DirectX, and 
that's one step above the hardware.  All DMDX communication paradigms 
revolve around the communicatee being on another machine, the only way I 
can think of doing it would be to wire a signal output from another program 
to a PIO12 and have DMDX pick the response up that way.  In any event, it's 
usually better to let DMDX be the master timing component in such setups.

   Agreed.  While it's faintly possible that DMDX would function with 
another data intensive application on a really fast machine, it's not 
probable and  in any event it's performance is sure to be degraded.

   Yep, buy another machine, buy a PIO12 and wire the input device to both 
machines with a opto-isolater.

Hi
I'm very new to DMDX . But trying to do something the same as Petr
 My experiment includes a stimulus (backward masked) and a dot probe
simultaneously recording skin conductance.
The problem of recording/synchronizing electrodermal to responses is also a
problem that I have.

My thinking has been to use two machines but using (wiring)  the keyboard
(response) of the DMDX machine as an a priori, that is observe/sample the
physiological reaction (on the physiological machine) prior to the
response.
Any further suggestion would be helpful

Does any one know whether electrodemal response can be converted and sampled
as a digital response? for reliable statistical analysis.?

regards Arch Tibben

   I find it is easiest to use a PIO12 and have DMDX trigger the 
electrophysical recording device with the  <Output> option.  Of course, 
this assumes the other device is capable of being triggered and a lot of 
them aren't.  Under those circumstances either you record DMDX's output 
pulse with the electrophysical package or you get it to trigger 
DMDX.  Either way you're going to need a technician (that or become 
technically inclined).

>Does any one know whether electrodemal response can be converted and sampled

   You mean sampled by DMDX as a vocal response?  I doubt it, frequency 
ranges are too far apart.

Sorry, Jonathan I meant recording a physiological skin response amplitude
(analogue) and convering to digtial output. My hope is to record level of
skin conductance   (have the equipment to do this) and tie this into the
keyboard (response) when stimuli is presented ont he moniter.
hope it makes sense

I have a very naive question, but could not find the answer on the DMDX's 
web page : can DMDX receive input from a serial port ?
thank you in advance

   Well sure you can do it, if you've got access to an engineer and at 
least a thousand dollars to build the electronics you'll need.  My bet is 
the easiest thing to do if you want it in real time is to use another 
machine and write some custom software to digitize and process the 
conductance data and to then send a signal to DMDX, probably thorough 
another PIO12 on the digitizing machine and received by another PIO12 in 
the DMDX machine.  That way you don't have to build and pay for irritating 
fixed function electronics that are almost guaranteed not to do what you want.
   If you don't have access to an engineer you'll have to process the data 
off line and integrate that data afterwards.  Possibly the easiest way to 
do that is to get DMDX to play a low frequency tone at the start of each 
trial and using a spare channel on your electrophysical data recording 
machine and record that tone, you'll probably need some resistors to lower 
the signal amplitude.  Some digitizing boxes have digital channels which 
removes the need to use an audio signal, you can just use a PIO12 in the 
DMDX machine.

   No.  Do you mean receive a serial word or simply poll the serial control

Dear Jonathon,

I need help regarding branching...for my experiment, I will present a picture
and the subject needs to decide if they recognize the picture--they have
a yes or no option. If they choose yes, a different question will be asked
of them on the next screen than if they choose no.

For example, I have written this line:

+1  <bmp> "george bush"/;

but I don't know where to go from here. Thank you for your help.

Sincerely,

Jasmeet

Reply-To: DMDX@psy1.psych.arizona.edu

I am extremely new to DMDX. I was wondering whether anyone else out there
has used DMDX to run a Visual Dot Probe Task (VDP). My searches so far have
come up empty.

The basic idea is to present pairs of monochrome photographs for 500ms. A
probe (either a square or triangle) then occurs in the location of one of
the pictures. The subjects task is to press one of two buttons to indicate
whether the probe is a triangle or square. Reaction time to the probe is
used to infer which picture the subject was looking at. That is, subjects
respond more quickly to probes that replace the attended picture than to
those that replace the unattended picture.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Amanda

am doing this. there's a recent query by a guy doing this with GSR 
also. search under self-paced dot probe, there's a section of my 
code there. hope this helps.

Hello,

I *thought* I knew exactly what my display was doing (looks ok), but the
deeper I went into the documentation to be sure, I started to doubt myself.
I would be very grateful for a reality check...

Here is my parameter line with two sample trials:

<ep> n128 <azk> f3 <id "keyboard"> <mr +g> <mnr +/> <mpr +z> <vm 640,480,480,16,0>
<eop>

    / %0 g "background" /x328 y272 ! g "image2" / %60 g "background" */;

+002 %60 x288 y304 g "arrow" / g "background", x288 y272 ! g "image1"
    / %6 g "background" /x328 y272 ! g "image2" / %60 g "background" */;


This is conceptually what I thought it was doing:

Trial 001:
arrow for 60 ticks {refresh rate of screen}
background + image1 for 3 ticks {refresh rate of screen}
background + image2 for 3 ticks {refresh rate of screen}
background for 60 ticks {begin timer}

Trial 002:
arrow for 60 ticks {refresh rate of screen}
background + image1 for 3 ticks {refresh rate of screen}
background for 6 ticks {refresh rate of screen}
background + image2 for 3 ticks {refresh rate of screen}
background for 60 ticks {begin timer}

   I concur.  Is there something that makes you doubt that that is in fact 
the display sequence?

   BTW, a bang in a frame that begins with a comma is superflous, the comma 
has a non-erase built in with it's use.  For example these two fragments 
are identical:

g "background", x288 y272 ! g "image1"
g "background", x288 y272 g "image1"

Hi,
I am trying to purchase hardware to run a visual dot probe experiment using
DMDX. The experiment involves presentation of  2 adjacent monochrome
photographs (500 ms). I am aware of current problems with using  GEFORCE2
video cards to display such images. The hardware I am considering
purchasing includes a 32MB ATI RADEON 4X AGP video card. Has anyone
experienced difficultites using this video card with DMDX?

Many Thanks
Amanda

   Not yet, not at least that I've heard about.  I have seen the various 
ATI cards perform adequately over the years and have reports of a recent TV 
out card of theirs functioning very nicely so I suspect you're on firm 
ground buying one.

I've successfully made a DMDX experiment for fMRI, that displays videos of
facial expressions to people. As it was rather tricky to set up and uses a
few new features of DMDX, I'd thought I'd post a sample script file for
others to use.

We had great difficultly manipulating video speed in Adobe premiere (above
30 fps) and decided to display the frames individually in DMDX. This is
great, because you can have the video frame rate as high as you want, and
you can easily adjust its speed (change the f value in the top line or
specify
each frame individually, eg. %2). By finding out the refresh rate of your
computer,
you can work out exactly how long a 'video' is displayed for (tick duration
x no of ticks per still x no of stills).

The disadvantage of this method is that each frame has to be loaded from the
disk. This substantially increases the delay that DMDX requires between
items.
Since this was an fMRI experiment we needed to keep this delay to a minimum.
With the speed of presentation in this expt however, the computer couldn't
cope
and kept on reporting missing ticks. The computer is a pentium III at
700Mhz,
has a 16MB graphics card and has 512MB of RAM, so no small potatoes here. We
could only get this to work with a delay parameter of  75 ticks (about  1000
milliseconds) which was too long for our purposes.

The solution to this is to load all the pictures BEFORE the participant
starts
the expt and to use the <MediaLife x> command. This keeps the pics in memory
for as many items as you specify (as n=191 in this expt, <ml 191> should be
ideal... to be safe, we stuck it at 360). To have an idea of how much this
speeds up loading times, in the final experiment we could display 11 frame
videos at, 2 ticks (~25msec) per frame with a compulsory delay of only 2
ticks between items (the time used by DMDX to load and save data).

Holding all the images in RAM in this way puts quite a heavy load onto the
machines memory. However, in our experience this wasn't too much of a
problem.
For our experiment, we needed to load 191 full screen, grey-scale bit map
files.
These took up about 65 MBytes (0.3 Mb / picture) on the disk and so were
well
within the capacity of our PC.

Another advantage of a smaller <d ...> is that you can also have a longer
period for recording subject responses (using the <t ...> command). See
Matt Davis's FAQ for other info on continuous running expts for fMRI:


http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/personal/matt.davis/fmri_dmdx.html

Also check out the help file at

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhtimingnotes.htm


Other things to consider:

1. Your screen resolution and colour depth affects the tick rate. By
modifying this, you can indirectly change the speed of the video. The change
from 32 bit to 16 bit colour is HARD to notice (as in impossible), but
significantly speeds up video presentation. Useful if your frame rate is a
low multiple of your tick rate (1, 2, 3's etc).

2. Another way to adjust the tick rate is to alter the screens Refresh rate.
Right click on the screen, goto settings, advanced, adapter and then have a
play. Also, crucially, make sure you are not displaying 'videos' faster than
the display (important in fMRI when projectors are used).

3. Chances are you don't want to see the pics as they are loading. Use  <bmp
1,1,1,1>  to hide them. This maps the top left corner of the pic onto the
bottom right. We added a "Loading Images" to this part, it flickered after
each block loaded; useful stress buster, if u can see something happening,
you know it hasn't crashed. One thing that might be useful in a future
version of DMDX would be a more 'official' way of loading pictures without
displaying them on screen... how about a <BufferImage> keyword?

4. For a more exact figure on the minimum delay, you could look at the
maximum time it takes a pic to load when its in memory (look at the
preparation times that DMDX outputs after you have run the expt).
Perhaps add on a few ticks for good measure as well. To reduce the <d ...>
value to 1 you would probably have to use a second computer to record
responses...

5. Don't number the 'load up' items as 0 as this tells DMDX to wait for a
response before moving onto the next item.

Hope the script is of use to people,

Andy.

(cheers goes to Matt for coming up with some cunning idea's).

   Stick a %0 in the frames doing the loading and put your "loading" frame 
afterwards without a non-erase (no !).

Does the value specified for the Delay parameter in the parameter line add
to the duration of the item within the timeout window or after the timeout
occurs? 

My stimulus duration is much shorter than my timeout and I would like to
add more time to the item after the stimulus occurs so that the item lasts
a little longer than the timeout period. Can I do this by increasing the
Delay parameter?

Thanks,

   The delay specifies the time from when the item is deemed to have 
finished, what constitutes the end of an item depends on the item.  In your 
case it will be from the subject timeout because that is the last thing to 
occur.

   Technically, yes.  I would usually put a dummy frame in that ensured the 
display lasted longer.  There's nothing to stop you having a frame that has 
the same visual component as the preceding one if you need to extend the 
display.

I don't understand a couple of things about the outputting of data to the
PIO card.   (If I had a PIO board now, I would be able to answer these
questions myself in a matter of minutes)

(1)  What the N or H arguments of the Output and OutputHex functions,
respectively?

Two explanations are plausible, either:

        a)  N/H is the ADDRESS of the BIT that will be written to, e.g.,
        - output a '1' to bit 8 of PIO board:  <Output 8> 1

        or ...

        b)  N/H is the VALUE that will be written to the 8, 16, or 24 bit
        (depending on the board) output register of the board, e.g.,
        - output a '1' to bit 8 of PIO board, all other bits '0':  <Output
256> or <OutputHex F0>
        - output '1' to bit 9:  <OutputHex F00>
        - output '1's to bits 8 and 9:  <OutputHex FF0>
        (Where '1' is an electrically High state and '0' is an electrically
Low state)


(2)  Isn't the PIO output latched by the card?  Either way, if you do
output, you need to embed the Output
     in a timing routine to create the desired output waveform (e.g., a
single pulse), don't you?

     e.g., output not latched, output 100 msec pulse:  <ms% 100> <OutputHex
F00> /  . . .
     e.g., output latched:   <ms% 100> <OutputHex F00> / <OutputHex 0> <REM
need to set value back to 0 after 100 msec>


(3)  May I suggest sticking an example or two into the help file(s) ?  You
may find that a few examples here
 and there will forestall many hours of answering (or at least reading)
questions from people like me.


Thanks,

I want to confirm that 24 channel I/O boards (e.g., PIO-24) CANNOT be used
for signal inputs (e.g., response buttons).  I get that distinct impression
from the "Input" page of the online help files (" PIO12output24   Only
outputs 24 bits to a PIO12   No Buttons")

If so, the inability to use 24+ channel boards for INPUT is a distinct
hindrance to future the growth of DMDX because 16 channel boards are not as
widely availlable as they once were.  Measurement Solutions, formerly
Computerboards (http://www.computerboards.com/) only has one 16 channel
board for $200, the ISA bus CIO-PDMA16.  This board emulates the 8254 and is
perhaps not DMDX compatible.  Similarly, Keithly has only the 12 channel ISA
bus PIO-12.  With neither comnpany making PCI bus cards with less than 24
channels, the handwriting is on the wall.

On the other hand, DMDXer Michael Wenger at Notre Dame writes about using a
Keithly 24 channel PCI I/O board  "to collect responses off the button box
and generate TTL pulse for controlling the goggles."
(http://www.nd.edu/~mwenger1/), so I is really confused at this here
juncture as to if DMDX does the old in and out on 24 channel boards.

   That is because no one has yet to use more than 8 bits of input let 
alone 16 and is a choice I make in DMDX, it has nothing to do with the 
hardware.  The 24 lines on a PIO24 can be used either as all input or all 
output or 8 out and 16 in or 16 out and 8 in.

This is in response to the previous postings about 'synchronizing'
electrophysiological recordings
(e.g., electro dermal responses) with DMDX generated stimuli.

I am synchronizing DMDX activities (trial onsets, stimuli, responses) with
electrophysiological signals by recording
analog 'flags' on one channel of a multichannel digital acquisition
recorder.

Using a simple OP-AMP volatge summing circuit, I essentially have a digital
to analog converter with generates
a specific DC voltage for each PIO port output. I could have recorded the
PIO outputs directly on seperate channels
but the software signal detection processing required to recover the flags
is much simpler using only one channel.

For example, a -0.5 V pulse corresponds to the onset of the trial, -1.0 V to
the stimulus presentation,
and -1.5 V to the response - each generated by writing to a seperate PIO
output bit.

The electronic schematic below roughly illustrates the concept (drawing in
ASCII is a real pain!).
"R" refers to a resistance value.

                              |---( R )---< GND >
PIO OUT 1 ----( R )------|    |
                         |    -- |.
PIO OUT 2 ----( 2R )-----|       |+  .
                         |       |    .--------> OUTPUT (- input)
PIO OUT 3 ----( 3R )-----|-------|- .   |
                         |       |.     |
                         |              |
                         |----( xR )----|

Please feel free to contact me directly if you need more more specific
guidance.

Hi Derek
Very exciting stuff
How do  you compensate for time delay of physiological responses, that is
....I find GSR response slow when (quick) emotional stimuli is being
observed on a screen.
 I somehow need to latch (synchronize) these responses together and, further
would like to change the analogue output to a digital one. (for statistical
purposes)
I don't know if that is possible however there are obviously analogue to
digital converters around ...I nee to investigate this

regards

keen Arch
PS Maybe you can use "attatchment" on your email for drawings

   Not if you post it to the list please.  It borks up the list archive if 
it doesn't outright crash the list server and is explicitly against the 
terms of use of this list serv.  Don't do it.  If you must send attachments 
send them to the relevant individuals directly.  If you do want us to see a

Hi

I'm setting up a serial recall experiment using DMDX, using auditory 
presentation and recording spoken responses using the RecordVocal and 
DigitalVOX input devices.

As the lists are quite long, the item timeout is set to a large value 
(20000) to accommodate slow responding. However, given few long pauses on 
the subject's part during recall, recall can take considerably less time 
than this.

Is it possible to allow a keyboard response to trigger the end of a trial, 
interrupting the timeout?

I've asked around here, and our resident experts Mike Ford and Matt Davis 
can't come up with a solution.



Header: need continuous running, frame duration is ~1 s. The video mode 
(1024x768, 16 bit) works quite well on my machine. I hope the syntax on the 
input device params is right.

Item lines. "ready" displayed for 300 ms visually, then 12 digits played in 
4 groups of 3. The timer is started immediately following the last item. 
"Recall" displayed for the first 3s of the response period.  It is *this* 
part that I need help with: I would like to let the keyboard interrupt the 
20s timeout and let the experiment move onto the next trial.

Any help would be appreciated.

thanks

Nick

   Not unless you care to sponsor a modification to DMDX.

   It's been ages since I looked at any of that code but there are good 
reasons for it being as simple as it is, it's awfully tricky stuff by 
itself and combined with the rest of DMDX I have to think long and hard 
about any mods made to it at all.

   As I recall the proposed modification was to allow the RecordVocal 
length to be set by the timeout as it currently is but to have that timeout 
begin when the DigitalVox triggered -- or perhaps a bit easier from a 
coding point of view to have two timeouts, the original specifying the 
absolute timeout and the second specifying how long after a DV trigger to 
record for.  Hairier than a raccoon's proverbial but possible 
nonetheless.  But that's major modification and as such totes a major 
sponsorship to go with it.

   There's a new version of TimeDX in the DMDX.ZIP archive that has an 
expanded PIO test that will now read 16 bits of input.  There are enough

have been irritated by TimeDX only testing a few buttons that I finally 
expanded the thing.

Hi,
I am trying to run a categorization experiment without feedback after each
stimulus. Nevertheless, after 24 stimuli I would like to provide the
participants with their error rates.
How could I display the error rates to subjects in DMDX?
I scanned many sites. Surprisingly, I could not find any clue to this
question.
I would be glad about any tips.
Thanks
Jan

   Hmm, no one's ever wanted to do that before.  You can do it but it's 
going to be ugly as hell.  Basically you're going to want to build a 
subroutine to do it:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhbranchkeyword.htm

   In your subroutine your going to want to load a counter up with the 
current error rate:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhsetcounterkeyword.htm

   Because DMDX can't actually display a counter as a stimulus you're going 
to have to have an item for each possible error rate -- you might want to 
bin them a little, OTOH, once you've built the subroutine you don't have to 
worry about it again.  Anyway, you're going to have a series of items that 
compare the counter against ever increasing constants until it's no greater 
than them and then display a corresponding item and return.  Something like 
the following:

f20 <nfb>
0 "ErrorRate Feedback Example" <bu 1000>;
111 <set 1,errorrate> d0!%0 <bicgt 1,0,1> c;
0 "Error Rate 0%" <return>;
1 d0!%0 <bicgt 1,1,2> c;
0 "Error Rate 1%" <return>;
2 d0!%0 <bicgt 1,2,3> c;
0 "Error Rate 2%" <return>;
3 d0!%0 <bicgt 1,3,5> c;
0 "Error Rate 3%" <return>;
5 d0!%0 <bicgt 1,5,10> c;
0 "Error Rate 5%" <return>;
10 d0!%0 <bicgt 1,10,20> c;
0 "Error Rate 10%" <return>;
20 d0!%0 <bicgt 1,20,50> c;
0 "Error Rate 20%" <return>;
50 "Please Try to be Correct" <return>;

+1000 * "target";
+1000 * "target";

   The clumsiness could be mitigated by providing some kind of token 
replacement within a frame, so something like / "Error Rate: %%counter1%%%" 
/ would display 'Error Rate: 100%' and if people need average RTs then a 
few more counter manipulation facilities will address that.  However the 
feedback would remain subroutine based, I'm not about to touch DMDX's 
feedback stuff when I've got a passable infinitely flexible alternative in 
the Call keyword.  But I'm not going to gaily add this stuff just to make 
DMDX a better program, every thing that gets added decreases or stands a 
chance of decreasing the overall stability of DMDX -- this is true for any 
program.  So until someone here wants it or someone wants to sponsor 
something it won't get added.

Yes,
it works great! First I was afraid that it would take too long to branch
through all
the possibilities. However, it is quite fast. Additionally, as the code
changes only
systematically it can be produced quickly with C or other programming
languages.

   That's the d0!%0 for you.  Given today's CPUs I don't think you could 
put enough decisions in there to be noticeable.

   That's DMDX for you, it's not pretty but it can be made to do an amazing 
number of different tasks -- as long as I'm around anyway...

DMDXers:

This is a day we'll never forget.  A day that will really live in infamy.
I'm releasing this note about some new software.  Can't seem to concentrate 
on serious things.

	--Ken Forster

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RELEASE OF NEW DATA ANALYSIS SOFTWARE FOR .AZK FILES
----------------------------------------------------------------

Jonathan has written three new Windows programs for analyzing data from 
.azk files.  These are designed to carry out similar functions to the 
original DMASTR programs UNLOAD, DATMAK, UPDATE and CONCAT, which were 
designed to handle binary .dtp output files.

We have been checking these programs out very carefully, and we can 
guarantee that they give same results as the original programs (plus or 
minus 1 ms). Actually, the new programs are more accurate than the old 
(different rounding procedures).

Those of you who wish to confirm this can convert existing .dtp files to 
.azk files using the program DTP2AZK.EXE, and then compare the output of 
the .azk based programs with the .dtp based programs.

The new programs are:

(1) UNLOADAZK:  This program asks for a source file (an .azk file) and a 
destination.  The .azk file is transferred to the new destination, 
appending the new material to any existing file with the same name.  The 
original file is then renamed as an .rdb (raw data backup) file.

(2) ANALYZE:  Computes subject and item mean RTs and error rates from .azk 
files.  The assignment of items to conditions is specified in an 
.spc(specification) file.  This is an ordinary text file, and includes a 
number of parameters which specify computational options (e.g., data 
trimming, error rate criterion for exclusion of subjects, analyze only 
incorrect responses, etc). ANALYZE produces for each .azk file two output 
files: (a)  an .ism (item summary) file, which lists the mean RT and error 
rates for each item in each condition, and (b) a .das file, which has 
exactly the same format as the original .das files.

(3) CONCATENATE:  Combines data from several .das files in a suitable 
fashion for input to ANOVA programs.  The method of concatenation is 
specified in a .cat file which lists the name of the .das file, and the 
conditions to be selected from it.

Each program has its own HELP function.  Pressing COPY will copy the 
contents to the clipboard.

Download these programs from:

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/dmdxutils.zip



Example of .spc file:
----------------------------

# any line with # at the beginning is a comment

title: SN3a Form priming with shared neighbor Target N=1

# any text appearing after "title:" will be used as a title.

discard_display_errors
# if there was a display error on an item, the data from this trial is 
discarded.
# this option can be turned off either by deleting the above line, or
# by inserting # at the beginning of the line, e.g.,
#discard_display_errors

subject_rejection: 20
# subjects making 20% errors over all items being analyzed are rejected

data_threshold: 2.0
# any RTs more than 2.0 S.D. units away from the overall mean RT for each 
subject
# will be trimmed, either by setting it equal to the cutoff value (the 
default),
# or by exclusion (see next option).

data_rejection
#  any RTs selected by the data_threshold are excluded.

low_cutoff: 200
# RTs faster than 200 ms will be discarded

#rt_width: 7
#rt_precision: 1
# specifies the output format of the .das file. rt_width is the number of
# columns (default 5), and rt_precision is the number of decimals (default 0).

#analyze_incorrect_responses
# use this if you want to analyze only the incorrect responses.

# now follows the item assignments.

condition: 1	
name: c1
description:	low N	target SN+ prime
items: 1-9 11 12
# items 1 to 9, 11, and 12.


condition: 2	
name: c2
description:	low N	SN-		
items:14-16 18 19-26

condition: 3	
name: c3
description:	unrelated
items: 27-39


Example of .cat file
--------------------

# comment

title: low density targets
# this will appear on the .ism and .das file

#rt_width: 7
#rt_precision: 1
# as in the .spc file

dasfile: exp1a.das
subject: 1-3
# the first three columns of the output will list the subject means for the 
first
# three conditions of the file "exp1a.das".

dasfile: exp1b.das
subject: 1-3
# columns 4-6 will have conditions 1-3 of exp1b.das

# the above will generate a matrix with N rows (equal to the number of 
subjects)
# and 6 columns, corresponding to the conditions specified above.  It will also
# do the same for error rates.

dasfile: exp1a.das
item: 1
dasfile: exp1b.das
item:2

# this asks for item means.  First column will be item means for condition 1
# in file exp1a.das, and the next column will be item means for condition 2
# in file exp1b.das (i.e., a counterbalanced design).


dasfile: exp1b.das
item: 1
dasfile: exp1a.das
item:2

# same as above, except reversed.

Can anyone help me. I'm trying to run DMDX for the first time on a
Pentium 3, 1 GHz, Win98 OS, with 256 MB RAM. I've tested all components
with TimeDX, however, when attempted to run a .rtf demo - it displays
the initial instruction screens and then crashes when stimuli is
displayed. I have tried this several times using different files. Is
this a problem because I am using a GeForce2Ultra driver?
What can I do and are there any possible ways to overcome this problem,
else I can't move on any further.

thanks
Kay.

Hi,

I'm trying to run an experiment where trial n+1 begins as soon as there has
been a response for trial n.  This wouldn't be a problem except I'm using
voice input, and, according to the DMDX Help File, using the Vox key means
test items are presented until time out and never for a shorter period.  

Has anybody found any solution to this problem?  I presume it isn't the
first time it's come up.

Many thanks,
Sam

   Yep, it's the GeForce drivers.  It's not so much that they're crap it's 
that NVIDIA refuse to make them work with DMDX.  The solution is to reduce 
the number of back buffers that DMDX uses to 4 with the -buffers command 
line option.  Edit the target of a shortcut to DMDX so it changes from:

C:\DmDX\dmdx.exe

to:

C:\DmDX\dmdx.exe -buffers 4

   Unless you are performing the most demanding of DMDX tasks you should be 
fine.  If you notice that there are display errors you'll probably want to 
halve the number of line to blit at once in TimeDX for each video mode but 
I doubt it, blitters are incredibly fast these days.

   I'm seeing some pretty scary behavior out of ANALYZE.EXE incase anyone 
except us has started using it.  The program generates good results the 
first time it's run, but it would appear that the second time the program 
analyzes something without exiting after it's already analyzed one data set 
there's something really wrong with it.

   Found the error in ANALYZE.EXE and it's fixed in 1.07.  It had to do 
with missing data points, if you have item files that always have all items 
in them (no conditional branching) I can't see that you would have 
experienced problems.  If you had a missing data point and you used ANALYZE 
a second time without exiting those data points could be un-initialized -- 
the catch 22 was that they looked like they actually had zeros in them, it 
wasn't until you examined the hexadecimal data that you could see they 
weren't zero.  The archive is updated.

   This is a big update as it adds a new CR and futzes with some pretty low 
level mechanics.  While I've tested it I can't test everything (or won't, 
put it that way, this is why DMDX is free), people might want to keep a 
copy of their existing DMDX.EXE just in case I screwed something up.  This 
is something I've been wanting to add for some time now and the recent 
error rate reporting solution was enough impetus to finally sit down and do it.

Skip Display Keyword

<SkipDisplay>
<sd>

Special CR equivalant:
~

     This keyword and CR indicator is provided to facilitate the branching 
and subroutine abilities and it is designed to be used in either
dummy items for branch destinations or decision making items in 
subroutines. When <sd> is present in an item there are several
effects, the first of which being that that item's frames are not passed to 
the drawing or display routines, after it is parsed those
proto-frames are discarded. The second effect is that the item 
automatically continues to the next item (unless there's some branching in
there), the same as the <Continue> keyword would. The third effect is that 
the request time for the previous item is left as the request
time for this item allowing the <delay> keyword to be used across items 
with branches in them. Also, preparation times are not
reported for <SkipDisplay> items and when used as a CR indicator at the 
start of an item the item is not printed in the diagnostics
(both of which can save considerable time).
     While d0!%0c has much the same effect as <sd> there are several 
Sleep() calls between items and within frames that would typically
add up to 10 milliseconds plus two or three sevenths of the retrace 
duration per item that are designed to allow any operating system
activity that might be pending to proceed at a known safe time instead of 
in the middle of a time critical display, <sd> bypasses these.
While 15 milliseconds might not matter most of the time as the demands 
placed on DMDX get more complex over time I am personally
writing subroutines that have more and decisions in them and in extreme 
cases might want 100 decisions which would take 1.5 seconds
to parse with d0!%0c whereas using <sd> results in something like 100 
milliseconds (less when used as CR). And there's no way that
d0!%0c can cope with things like fMRI scripts that require absolutely 
constant ISIs, at the very least d2!%0c would have to be used.
     For example the branching example could be re-written:

f20 <nfb>
0 "Acoustic Feedback Example" <bu 100>;
10 <biw 20> <sd>;
0 d20 <wav> "correct" <return>;
20 <binr 30> <sd>;
0 d20 <wav> "wrong" <return>;
30 d20 <wav> "noresponse" <return>;

+100 * "target" / <call -10> c;
+110 * "target" / <call -10> c;

     A more strenuous example might be the case of displaying the subjects 
error rate. Because DMDX can't actually display a counter as
a stimulus one to has to have an item for each possible error rate:

f20 <nfb>
0 "ErrorRate Feedback Example" <bu 1000>;
~111 <set 1,errorrate>
<bicgt 1,0,1>; 0 "Error Rate 0%" / <return>;

I seem to remember someone asking about using Chinese characters with an
English version of Win98 on DMDX, but can't find it in the archive.  Is this
possible?  I can display characters fine in .rtf files, but DMDX won't run
the files.  Is there a quick way around this?  Or am I making .gif files for
the next couple of days?

Hi Matthew,
    Try and install a Chinese viewer program such as njwin (available
for free trial at http://www.njstar.com). Run the program before you
start DMDX (you should see the Chinese character "nan" at the bottom
when njwin is open). Let me know if you have any problem. I also
described all the procedures in an Email message to Ken a long time
ago.

Best,

I seem to remember someone asking about using Chinese characters with
an
English version of Win98 on DMDX, but can't find it in the archive.  Is
this
possible?  I can display characters fine in .rtf files, but DMDX won't
run
the files.  Is there a quick way around this?  Or am I making .gif
files for
the next couple of days?

Hello!  Thanks for the link.  I gave it a shot and it got DMDX to run the
item file, but, unfortunately, when DMDX runs it replaces all my characters
(Kanji) with question marks and saves it to the item file!  Ughh.  Don't
know how to get around this one.

Take care.  Any suggestions much appreciated!

Matthew

right, sorry, should have been more specific.  it reports "unknown RTF
control".  When I use the option to ignore these, it replaces my Kanji
characters with question marks in the display, and, quite surprisingly, it
appears to be replacing the characters with question marks in the .rtf item
file itself.

   Well, DMDX doesn't have the ability to edit an RTF file so it must be 
some spectacular side effect.  In any event if Word 2000 is being used to 
produce the file it leaves about million stupid meaningless RTF control 
words in a file so modifying DMDX to correctly parse it's output is 
something I'd rather not do, if you have an earlier version of Word open 
and save the file in that and see if the problem goes away.  If you don't 
have one I have several old versions, and it would appear that you can 
happily have multiple versions installed on one machine.  If using an older 
version of Word just for DMDX is too much of an inconvenience or you are 
already using an older version (say 97 or earlier) send me the file at 
jforster@u.arizona.edu along with the particular font it's using (it will 
be in windows\fonts) and I'll see if I can determine the million and oneth 
different way Word has chosen represent characters.

Hi Matthew,

I have no problem using DMDX to present Chinese. However, I did a number of things before I run my programs.
(1) Check my computer using TimeDX to find out what the characters are used in it to represent the "keyboard".
(2) In the control line of the DMDX program, key in the word "keyboard" (in <id "keyboard">) in "Chinese".
(3) In the program lines, "mapping response" (mr) should be added whenever keyboard responses are needed. See the following example.

0 <mr +Space> "Press Space........

Good luck with your experiment.

   I realized shortly after deciding to use the tilde as a CR indicting 
that the display of an item should be skipped that tilde was the macro 
expansion character -- oops.  My examples work because there are no macros 
being used and macro expansion code upon finding a tilde without a known 
macro character simply leave the tilde in the item.  Even if macros were 
being used they would have to have macros 0 to 9, macros A..Z and others 
would be fine.  To fix it I started considering other possible characters 
however there are no other characters available for a CR indicator that 
don't already have uses elsewhere or that were otherwise 
unacceptable.  While characters with other uses would parse correctly they 
would probably be as confusing as having tilde do two things so after much 
consideration I'm going to leave things as they stand.  Which simply means 
that should you be using macros 0..9 and also be wanting to use tilde for a 
<SkipDisplay> item you have two choices.  The first is to simply put a 
space between the tilde and the first character of the item number, the 
second to use the keyword instead of the tilde.  For example:

~ 1 <bicgt 1,1,2>;
<sd>1 <bicgt 1,1,2>;

   Two small fixes to Concatenate are in the DMDXUTILS zip, column numbers 
larger than is in .DAS file is now dealt with and a missing subject columns 
specification is also handled.

Wondering if anyone can help out a DMDX newbie...

I've had a Keithley PIO12 installed to send a 5V output signal to a data
aquisition unit at the onset of trials. I'm trying to test it, and
currently have it output to a scope. I'm running a test script I've
borrowed off the listserv, which includes 
0 <o 1> "Start of experiment";
just to see if anything is happening.  Though DMDX runs through the script
without errors (and everything else seems to be working perfectly), I'm
not seeing any change in voltage on the scope.

Any ideas how to problem solve this?

   Use TimeDX's PIO test.  Set it's base address to the address the card is 
using or change the card's base address to 310 instead of the default 
300.  Don't forget to save that address.  Toggle output bits in TimeDX till 
you see them change on the scope, then try DMDX.

Subject: [DMDX] on rating gathering (and the coincident DMDX 2.5.01)
Mime-Version: 1.0

Reply-To: DMDX@psy1.psych.arizona.edu

   Somebody wanted feedback on a rating based experiment here so I came up 
with a couple of methods to do it.  One of them doesn't involve using <zil> 
and <zor> and the other does.  While developing the second I noticed that 
<zil>'s tendency to report No Responses regardless of whether the item even 
has a clockon in it was get a little grating so we have DMDX 2.5.01 where 
<zil> only reports if there is a clockon in the item.

   The first rating solution is to use the standard response gathering mode 
but to bind all rating keys to the positive response and then branch (call 
actually) on the keystroke generating additional output by emitting a 
counters value and also providing feedback based on the particular branch 
taken:

<ep> <vm 1024 768 768 16 0> <nfb> F10 <id "keyboard">
<umpr> <umnr> <mpr +1><mpr +2><mpr +3><mpr +4><mpr +5><mpr +6><mpr +7>
<mpr +8><mpr +9><mpr +0> <eop>

0 "Rating Example" <bu 1000> mC#<mwc +1,-101, +2,-102, +3,-103, +4,-104, 
+5,-105, +6,-106, +7,-107, +8,-108, +9,-109, +0,-110, cinr,-100>#;

100 "No Response." <return>;
101 <set 1,1> <emit 1> d2 "1" <return>;
102 <set 1,2> <emit 1> d2 "2" <return>;
103 <set 1,3> <emit 1> d2 "3" <return>;
104 <set 1,4> <emit 1> d2 "4" <return>;
105 <set 1,5> <emit 1> d2 "5" <return>;
106 <set 1,6> <emit 1> d2 "6" <return>;
107 <set 1,7> <emit 1> d2 "7" <return>;
108 <set 1,8> <emit 1> d2 "8" <return>;
109 <set 1,9> <emit 1> d2 "9" <return>;
110 <set 1,10> <emit 1> d2 "10" <return>;

+1000 * "target" ~c c;
+1000 * "target" ~c c;

0 "end" l;


   The second solution was to use the <zor> method of <zil> doing away with 
the counter shenanigans but instead requiring me to change DMDX to prevent 
<zil> from making excessive No Response output:

<ep> <vm 1024 768 768 16 0> <nfb> F10 <id "keyboard">
<zil> <zor> <vzk +1><vzk +2><vzk +3><vzk +4><vzk +5><vzk +6><vzk +7>
<vzk +8><vzk +9><vzk +0> <umpr> <umnr> <mpr +1><mpr +2><mpr +3><mpr +4><mpr 
+5><mpr +6><mpr +7><mpr +8><mpr +9><mpr +0> <eop>

0 "Rating Example" <bu 1000> mC#<mwc +1,-101, +2,-102, +3,-103, +4,-104, 
+5,-105, +6,-106, +7,-107, +8,-108, +9,-109, +0,-110, cinr,-100>#;

100 "No Response." <return>;
101 d2 "1" <return>;
102 d2 "2" <return>;
103 d2 "3" <return>;
104 d2 "4" <return>;
105 d2 "5" <return>;
106 d2 "6" <return>;
107 d2 "7" <return>;
108 d2 "8" <return>;
109 d2 "9" <return>;
110 d2 "10" <return>;

+1000 * "target" ~c c;
+1000 * "target" ~c c;

Hello every body

My purpose is to present a letter for 250ms, every500ms.
Each time the subject see an X he should answer.
The script is like this

250 d10 <bmp> "A"
250 d16 <bmp> "black"
250 d32 <bmp> "B"
250 d16 <bmp> "black"
+001 d32 <bmp> *<X>
250 d16 <bmp> "black"
....and so on
My point is that * seems to add an extra delay
depending on the reaction time.

if a set <t 1000> it is far too long.

Thus my question to anyone is
how can I make the time corresponding to
250 d32 <bmp> "B"
250 d16 <bmp> "black"
equal to the time corresponding to
+001 d32 <bmp> *<X>
250 d16 <bmp> "black"
and this in an independent way
of the subject's reaction time.

Does anyone has any idea ???
I appreciate the help
Cheers,
Jean-Francois

I have the vague understanding that the accuracy and precision of DMDX
stimulus presentations and response timing measurements dependant on the
Video display vertical scan rate - a 'tick'.  So, a video adapter + monitor
operating at a 40 Hz refresh rate is less desirable in terms of DMDX timing
than 110 Hz?  Am I correct?

A related question is how DMDX functions with the 'new' flat-screen TFT/LCD
monitors?  My even more vague impression is that these are not 'scanned',
but rather addressed.  Do these present different operating charateristics
to a program like DMDX?

Thank you,

Derek

Yes.  You have, for lack of the correct technical term, a rise time.  That 
is, although, DMDX is accurate in starting the presentation, it takes a 
certain amount of time for the LCDs to get to full luminance (around 8-10 
ms if I recall correctly).  Also at offset of presentation it takes time 
for the LCDs to fade, although we found that the fading out was faster than 
the fading in.  I have the relevent times somewhere for our Dell laptops, I 
can look these out if you like.  What it may mean is that although you have 
set the display for, say 50ms, an item may only be fully visible for say 
40-45ms and this will be shifted about 8-10 ms downstream.

   I belive I cove this in the Timing Notes:


     Gathering RTs is more complicated. You have to ensure that the display 
determines the duration of the item, you must set
the timeout lower than the item display duration. While theoretically you 
could leave the feedback enabled as it should have
a constant display interval I don't think it's ever been put to the acid 
test and who knows what you'd have to do with the delay
value:

d10 f29 <cr> t490 <nfb>
0 "start";
1 * "first"/!;
2 * "second"/!;
3 * "third"/!;
0 "stopped" l;

     Here f29 actually does something. It will be gathering responses for a 
tad less than half a second followed by 11 ticks of
time to assemble the next item during which the display will not have changed.
     Lastly, gathering RTs and displaying bitmaps requires sectioning each 
item into two distinct portions, an active part
where an RT is gathered and a passive part that is loading the next bitmap:

d59 f120 <cr> t1990 <nfb>
0 "start";
1 * g "first"/!;
2 * g "second"/!;
3 * g "third"/!;
0 "stopped" l;

     Here we still have a three second per item display, the first two 
seconds of which can have a response made and the last
second is buffering time to load the next bitmap while the display still 
shows the previous bitmap.

   Yep.  Unless of course the display duration you want happens to be an 
exact multiple of the lower refresh rate...

   The silicon driving those TFT monitors still behaves as if they had a 
refresh rate.  Usually a 60Hz refresh.  Mike's latency concerns are still 
an issue though.

   You can't use it with DMDX, it doesn't interface to serial 
devices.  Unless of course you could find windows DirectX drivers for it...

I'm trying to write something that can give different feedback toward
each response.
First, I try to use branching... but there's seems to be a limit for
using branching.
it's between 9~11 I guess cause when I call more than 9 different N then
the computer just crash
Is it true that there's a limit to branching?
Now I'm trying to do that with different feedback.
Is there any other way to do so?
Besides, it seems that when I use <biergt > I can no longer use
branching...
cause the program keeps telling me that nesting is not allowed when the
second cycle begins.

below is what I've wrote with "branching" and it crashed when there's
more than 10 calling
I don't know what's wrong :(

   See the docs:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhbranchiferrorrategtkeyword.htm

   If you want to use multiple tests against the error rate you have to 
load a counter with the error rate and test that counter.

>cause the program keeps telling me that nesting is not allowed when the

   You can't have two <call> keywords without an intervening <return>, they 
don't nest.  If you aren't intending to nest calls you must have missed a 
<return> somewhere.  You might want to turn on the branch diagnostics on:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhbranchdiagnosticskeyword.htm


>below is what I've wrote with "branching" and it crashed when there's
>more than 10 calling
>I don't know what's wrong :(

   Check the branch diagnostics.  You structure looks sound, maybe there's 
just a missing <return>.

   The /, is bad, either use a slash or use a comma, a comma following a 
slash is superflous.

   Unless I'm missing something all those sub routine look the same, why 
are there multiple versions of the function?

   You sent the .vcf file, your mail program has some setting set and it

I will be using a PIO12 to output 8 bits of data (e.g., InputDevice
"PIO12").

If I use another device for response input, I have to declare that too
(e.g.,  InputDevice "keyboard")  ...
Will both the Space bar of the KB and Bit 0 of the PIO12 be mapped as
"REQUEST" ?

   Yep.  If you don't want multiple keys you'll have to use the <UnMap...> 
keywords and then map the ones you specifically want.

   A couple of additions to both programs.  First off the <MinimumSleep> 
keyword:

Minimum Sleep Keyword

<MinimumSleep>
<minsleep>

     MDSP bit 2000000 modifier, the bit that makes DMDX sleep for the 
smallest possible times. Reset if N = 0, otherwise set. All MDSP
modifiers are both parameters and switches. If N is missing the bit is set 
and the mode is active.

     At various places DMDX will usually sleep for a number of milliseconds 
so that any pending operating system activity can be
performed then at a known safe time and not interfere with a display 
sequence. Or at least that's the theory, whether it works or not is
difficult to determine. In any case the amount of time spent sleeping is 10 
milliseconds at the juncture between two items and 1/7th of the
retrace interval whenever there is nothing that needs to be moved into 
display memory. Setting this MDSP bit changes those Sleep(n)
calls to Sleep(0) which signals to the OS that the current task is yielding 
only if something else is immediately pending, otherwise it would
like control back immediately.


   Second, the address of the PIO can either be entered as a hexadecimal 
value for ISA based cards or selected from the registry in the case of the 
PCI PIO cards.  Because TimeDX can't tell exactly what in the registry is 
an 8255 (the mere fact that it reads the registry to determine the base 
address of the 8255 is an extreme hack, utterly undocumented by anyone) it 
simply
hunts for resources that describe groups of 4 IO ports and lists them as 
possible candidates along with the device's description.  This should work 
for any PCI PIO card, be it the ComputerBoards one we use or the Keithly 
MetraByte that I noticed someone was using a few months ago.

I want to point out that Keithley PIO-12 boards manufactured after Nov 1996
and containing the CMOS 82C55 chip have internal pull-up resistors on their
inputs.  These are the ~4.7 K resistors from the inputs to +5V. (see the PIO
Test help page in TimeDx).

Using these newer PIO-Boards with 'external' pull-up resistor won't hurt the
board however.

The DMDX code fragment below illustrates a strange side effect of the Font
Multiplier <fm> function.

While the cross "+" is displayed correctly at coordinates (0.5,0.5),
multipying the size of the second character "O" causes it to grossly offset
from its 'correct' position.

     1  <ms% 2000> <xy 0.5, 0.5> "+" /;
     2  <ms% 2000> <xy 0.5, 0.5> <fm 10> "O" /;

Is there any gracefull correction for this?

   It's possible that all the devices we use are as even the old ISA cards 
that have the 40 pin 8255 in them have the 8255C devices (C being the CMOS 
suffix) and unless CMOS has a terminated input it latches up so all the 
ones I've seen must have internal pullup resistors.  Doesn't mean I'm about 
to stop putting pullup resistors on the response boxes I build though, 
better safe than sorry.

   The code is functioning correctly, <xy> specifies the coordinates of the

Ok, I understand.  The text characters are bit-mapped to 'blocks' which can
be scaled from their upper, left corner origin.
What I need is an horizontal and vertical center-justified display of my
character.  Naturally , I echo Matt Davis' sentiments:  "it would be better
if there was a way of specifying <<right justify> or <<left justify> for
text strings."

Since I can't stick the C settextjustify function into DMDX, I could roll my
own text justification of the <xy> parameters if I knew the size of the
bitmap character box.  E.g., a 'centered' character = <xy (.5 - .02) , (.5 -
.02)> (metaphorically speaking)

How do I know the bit map size of, for example, a 10-point character (in
pixels)?


Thanks,

Hi,

I'd like to display as feedback the fact that the subject's answer is right

So I need two items line to appear on the same screen and don't know how to
do (coma don't work in this case neither than <ne>)
Here is the script where "correct" appears first and after that "less than

As a followup to my previous question:

I see from the TimeDMDX - Select Video Mode - Fonts to Use menu, a list of
fonts with 4 specifications.

For example:  37 X 19      400wt      Courier New      <True Type>

I.  What do these mean?
(1)  37 X 19  -- Dimensions in pixels for character box?  But at what
font-point size ???
(2)  400wt -- text line 'weight' or 'boldness' ?
(3)  Courier New -- a freshly baked text?
(4)  <True Type> vs. <Raster>  -- what are the practical differences for me?

II.  When I <FontMultiply 10> my 37x19 character by 10, does it turn into a
370 x 190 character box?

III.  Is there a prayer of adding text justification to DMDX?

IV.  Where can I get a reference to the types of questions that I have been
asking?

Tanks,

Derek

   Actually you don't, you want center justification.  I agree it's useful 
but there are more than a hundred other things that might be useful too 
that I also don't just gaily add to the code.

   Without me changing the code (an unlikely possibility unless you choose 
to recompense me) you can use the TimeDX Select Video mode command.  It can 
display arbitrary text strings in various fonts and font sizes and the 
results window.  Well, it used to, I guess I streamlined it for version 2 
figuring no one would ever want to know such information.

   Pasting your script into my system yields the anticipated 
results.  Correct for example is displayed and then Attention is displayed 
in addition briefly below it.  Your problem is probably just with frame 
durations.

   I'd have to dive into a bunch of code to tell.  The easiest thing to to 
some rough calculation based on some large text characters and apparent 
portion of the screen that they take up.

   BTW, I hope you are aware that your original example of <xy .5 .5> with 
centering is exactly equivalent to the default display conditions with no 
<xy> keyword?  And that if you simply want to deflect something up or down 
and leave x centered you can just use the <y> keyword?

Thanks Jonathan,

I am concerned with the precise sizing and positioning of text characters in
the process of building a covert orienting paradigm.  I have finally hacked
my way up, down, underneath, and around the problem in the code I use to
generate the DMDX script.

If anyone is interested, I'll share some other time (it is 8 pm on friday
night and I'm starving)

But, one font point unit = 1/72" (~0.3528 mm).  You can measure the X and Y
distances for 0.1 screen units (for example) and then calculate the
relationship between point sizes, linear distances, and screen units.

   So I was looking at the code that positions things on the screen after 
Derek's trouble, primarily just to see how much work it would be.  And 
before I knew it I was thinking I might as well make the mods as there have 
been occasions when I personally have found myself going through mental 
gyrations determining what coordinates need to be specified to get a 
particular result and just being able to specify the middle would make 
things a whole lot easier.  So 2.5.03 adds the following:


XY Justification Keyword

<XYJustification N>

     Keyword and parameter to determine the justification used with the <x> 
and <y> keywords. The default value of zero for N makes X
and Y determine the coordinates of the left and top elements of the 
displayed image. N = 1 makes X and Y specify the center of the
displayed image, 2 makes X and Y determine the bottom right coordinates.
     <XYJustification> is evaluated as the item is parsed before the 
display is generated so multiple uses within an item are
meaningless, only the last used value will have any effect.

   There's possible two ways.  The more straight forward brute force method 
of including all possibilities explicitly is always possible as a last 
resort, however there is a chance that a more cunning method can be 
used.  Put a %0 in the "correct" item and a ! in the later item.  Any frame 
with no duration will not be displayed, it will however get drawn into the 
drawing buffer (the same way two frames separated by a comma do, a comma is 
exactly equivalent to %0 in the first frame and ! in the second), the 
"attention" item won't erase what's in the buffer because of the ! and 
therefore the two will be merged and displayed simultaneously.  In theory 
anyway.  You will have to make sure that the intervening frames with no 
display also have ! in them too, otherwise they'll erase the remains of the 
"correct" item.

Thanks it works nice!
I also found how to display the subject's RT (I used the method you
described with error rate even if that's a lot of lines) and the error rate
at the end of the block but couldn't find how to display the mean RT for
correct items.

   I doubt that you could.  I suspect in a few weeks I'll be adding an 
equation evaluator, then you'll be able to do it.

I don't know if equation evaluator means variables and "if" structures.
But if not, variables could be an easy way to implement it, don't you think?
I think that it would make dmdx very flexible. (and the scripts could be
clearer)

   You have variables and if structures already.  They're called counters 
and branches.  The equation evaluator will give the ability to set one 
counter equal to the sum or dividend or whatever of other counters.

   Flexibility is a double edged sword.  I could add dozens of marvelous 
things to DMDX just for the hell of it.  What you would get would be a far 
less stable program.  Just imagine if the thing crashed for no reason every 
now and then, how many people would use it?  You might argue that it 
crashes now, however that is always when there is a malformed item, the 
instability I talk about would start to occur randomly with perfectly good 
item files.  So I carefully weigh every component that gets added to DMDX 
and the equation evaluator is something I thought about adding before when 
adding counters in the first place, however at the time it added nothing 
that I needed and it certainly introduces vast scope for instability.  At 
this time it adds a feature that I will need to give DMDX the ability to 
handle a new paradigm (for it anyway) here, a baby attention study where 
looking times are needed instead of RTs and complicated branches are needed 
based on those looking times.

I am seeing a display error at msec 653186 stating that item 28 of my item
file has 5 ms of refused video flips which delayed the previous frame's
duration. However, 653186 msec, according to the COT output in the .azk
file, occurred in item 29, not item 28. Also, when I look at the difference
in COTs between item lines there is a large discrepancy for items 26 and
27 from what they should be, but not for item 28. Could someone please explain
why these error messages and COTs appear to be discrepant and which best
indicates the true site of increased time lag?

Thanks,

Hi all,
We've got a question re: feedback. Our experiment consists of 4 parts: =
training 1, test 1, training 2,  test 2.  We want to give feedback =
during the training phases, but not in the test phases. We tried putting =
<nfb> in all of our test item lines and no feedback keyword in our =
training item lines (and we don't have any keywords pertaining to =
feedback in the parameter line). The problem we're having is that in the =
first training and test phases, everything's fine. That is, the =
participant gets feedback in training 1 and no feedback in testing  1. =
However, when the participant gets to training 2, there is no feedback. =
Why??? What can we do to ensure feedback comes back on in training 2?
Please help.

   Use the keyword <nfb> correctly.  <nfb> by itself throws the flag on 
that turns feedback off.  Using it once affects every item following 
it.  If you want to turn feedback back on you will have to turn the no 
feedback flag off with <nfb 0>

Hi Sir,
I'm a new user to DMDX. I noticed that DMDX accepts inputs from keyboard,=

If not, Where could i get the PIO12. I need to get 2 feedback from the pa=

Jonathan,

I have a question about the function of the output command.
Currently, there are a number of us using the output command to mark a data
file being collected with software by neuroscan (NS)with trigger codes to
indicate the onset of events (e.g., slide onset, noise probe onset, etc).
The NS software requires that its trigger port be reset to 0 before it can
detect a new trigger code.  This leads to rather complicated multiframe
items.  For example, to mark the onset of a BMP file (code 32) and then the
onset of a wav file (code 234) presented during it requires the following
code:

302 o32 <graphic>"green" <% 10>/ o0 ! <% 290>/o234 <wav 2>  "wnprobe" <svp
start> /o0 ! <% 300>/;

Each unique event has to be subdivided into two parts to allow for the
output of the onset trigger followed by the output of 0 to reset the NS
trigger port.  Some of our more complicated design become almost unreadable
given the number of frames required to handle marking different events
within the trial.

Here is my question.  Is it possible to have a second output command (or
modification of the current one) that sends a very brief output code (few
ms) and then automatically resets to some hold value (e.g., 0)?  If such a
change would not reduce the stability of the code, I am more than willing to
organize a few of us using similar systems to provide you with compensation
for the change to the code.

Thanks John

   Yep.  If you don't want multiple keys you'll have to use the <UnMap...>

The reason it's called "Grape Nuts" is that it contains "dextrose",

   Yep.  Depends how much hold time you want though, if you just want a 
spike a microsecond in duration that's easy.  A millisecond's hold time (or 
more) is more complicated and probably what you need but it's also 
perfectly doable.

I have the same situation that generated John Curtin's question:

"The NS software requires that its trigger port be reset to 0 before it can
detect a new trigger code. This leads to rather complicated multiframe
items.
For example, ... 302 o32 <graphic>"green" <% 10>/ o0 ! <% 290>/o234 <wav 2>
"wnprobe" <svp
start> /o0 ! <% 300>/"

Perhaps thoughy, John doesn't realize that the output he sends to the PIO
(e.g., O 32) must be reset in the PIO using an o0.  This is because the PIO
outputs are latched - they stay in the state that you set them in until you
set them in another state.

I also want to remind the uninitiated user that seting an output port bit to
"1" actually means that it is put into an electrically low (~0 volts) state.
Accordingly, if the device you are interfacing with expects a +5 volt ("TTL
level") trigger, you need to toggle that bit to "0".  This is called 'active
low' logic

Perhaps a hypothetical new DMDX function, "TRIGGER", would generate trigger
'pulses' and allow the specification of either 'active high' or 'active low'
outputs?

For examples:
<REM "active high" logic protocol>
<REM set PIO12 mode output ports to low state at beginning of experiment>
<OX ff>  or <o 255>
<REM send +5 pulse to bit 1>
<TRIGGER high x1> or <TRIGGER high 1>


<REM "active low" logic protocol>
<REM set PIO12 mode output ports to low state at beginning of experiment -
actually they are already>
<OX 0>  or <o 0>
<REM send 'low' pulse to bit 7>
<TRIGGER low x80> or <TRIGGER low 128>

The lowest trigger pulse width that you could use, given older semiconductor
logic families is on the order of 20 nanoseconds.  A couple of microseconds
would seem like an eternity to "those guys"!

.. hypothetically speaking :)

Great to hear that you can easily (or at least can :-) implement the change.
I will check with neuroscan about width of the trigger pulse but I am almost
certain that it will need to be on the order of a millisecond or longer in
order to be reliably detected.  Most flexible would be code that provided
parameters for output value, pulse length and return state when pulse
complete.  Derek's suggestion for active hi vs. low wouldn't affect our
setups (our physio acquisition software allows us to set this at that end)
but sounds like a nice addition for others if possible.

Last time I compensated you for changes to the output command, you sent me
some links to what you were interested in receiving.  Can you do the same
again?  That way I can get a sense of cost and try to work it out with some
of my colleagues who will benefit from these changes.

Thanks again  John

   Wrong.  1 is +5v, it's positive logic and what you request output gets 
output.

   Thinking about it I guess Derek must have one of those High Drive cards 
and that they must be inverting the output.  Actually, ISTR someone else 
with a NS machine having inverted codes so it could well be the NeuroScan 
hardware that's doing the inverting.

Hi Sir,
I'm a new user to DMDX. I noticed that DMDX accepts inputs from keyboard,=
 mouse and Joystick. For my experiment, i need to get a feedback from the=
 patient inside the scanner. To do that, i will be using a separate Keypa=
d that could be connected to USB, serial ports. Is there a way to do that=
...Does DMDX recognize other ports...

If not, Where could i get the PIO12. I need to get 2 feedback from the pa=
tient. Positive and negative feedback.....

   I was planning on a minor release for some of these features but John 
Curtin's offer necessitates an interim release.  First the keywords added 
for John:

Revert Output Keyword

<RevertOutput F, N>
<ro F, N>

variant:
Revert Output Hex Keyword

<RevertOutputHex F, H>
<rox F, H>

     Parameter to change data Output to a PIO12 device from being latched 
to being momentary pulses F milliseconds long after which
the output lines revert to N or H.


Invert Output Keyword

<InvertOutput>
<io>

     Parameter to invert all words output to a PIO12 output device. Must 
occur after the device is mapped. See Input.


   Other things include the sub usages of <bmp N, N> and <dv N, N> being 
affected by the recently added <Justification> keyword.  Meaning <bmp N, N, 
N, N> is not affected.  And the addition of a keyword for the Looking Time 
study (which wasn't planned until the 2.6.00 release hence the reference in 
the docs):


Abort Item Key Name Keyword

<AbortItemKeyName text>
<aikn text>

     Parameter to specify the Abort Item key name. By default no key is 
specified and so items cannot be aborted. Once a valid key
available on the current input devices (see Input) is selected as the abort 
item key name, pressing that key will attempt to abort that item
and continue on to the next one -- any pending request will still have to 
be issued however.
     Not all things can be aborted, currently (DMDX 2.6.00) the display 
queue will still have to execute (logic to dump pending frames is
fraught with peril). What will be aborted however are any Digital Video and 
sound files (both normal wave files and streaming audio files)
that are still being played, they will be stopped instead. Any pending 
subject response timeout will also expire. This means that the
following items will not abort until the last blank frame is displayed:

0 <dv> "filename" / ;
+1 "target" * / ;

     The following items however will abort because there will be nothing 
left in the display queue:

0 <dv> "filename" ;
+1 "target" * ;

Jonathan is correct of course, setting a PIO-12 output bit to "1" makes the
corresponding PIO output port "pin" "high" (~+5 volts).  This is all well
explained in the "PIO test" section of the TimeDx help page.

The new <Revert> and <Invert> and <Justify> are godsends, thank you!

Something JCF wrote about generating milisecond long pulses being a problem
makes me want to say again that logic operates on a nanosecond time scale
and that a milisecond trigger pulse would be uneccesarily long.  Put into
context, this is equivalent to a computer running at 1000 Hz.  On the other
hand, long output pulses are more appropriate for generating marker signals
on pen recorders or LED displays etc ....  It looks like JCF's <revert>
function will allow the flexibility to do both.

Thanks again,

Derek

Hello there,

I have a question relating to timing errors, and I can't work out the answer
from the DMDX documentation. I wonder if anyone can help...

I have an item file containing lines like this:

0 <bmp> "hammer" / !;
+109 *<wav 2> "hammer" / !;
0 <bmp> "tree" / !;
+110 *<wav 2> "tree" / !;
... etc

Bitmaps are displayed on the screen, DMDX waits for a request input, and
then starts the clock and plays a sound file, whilst keeping the image on
the screen. The timing from sound file onset to button-press is critical.

Will DMDX report any difficulties that it has in timing this accurately,
please? If a process grabs CPU time when an image is being displayed, the
corresponding inaccuracy in timing is reported as a display error. But what
about if a process grabs CPU time and so plays a sound file late? It may be
that my question doesn't actually make sense - is the clock always started
at the true onset of a sound file in this case, please?

Any advice that people could give would be very useful!

Thanks,
Stuart.

Jonathan is correct of course, setting a PIO-12 output bit to "1" makes the
corresponding PIO output port "pin" "high" (~+5 volts).  This is all well
explained in the "PIO test" section of the TimeDx help page.

Something JCF wrote about generating milisecond long pulses being a problem

on pen recorders or LED displays etc ....  It looks like JCF's <revert>

   It's not a logic thing, it's a frequency thing.  Often there is a great 
big piece of wire between the DMDX machine and the NeuroScan machine, it 
has capacitance and thus needs to be charged up, this takes time and a 
nanosecond pulse is likely to get absorbed and be undetectable by the NS 
machine.  Plus it also depends how the NS hardware detects the pulses, if 
it periodically scans the input the pulse must be at least twice the 
polling frequency's duration.

   Yeah, I find it's best to make things as flexible as possible.  If 
there's some arbitrary constant when I write code I make it modifiable -- 
unless of course it's a right pain to make flexible, then we compromise...

   No, inter item timing is flexible unless you use a <Delay> parameter. 
Use an item structure like the following:

+109 <bmp> "hammer" / *<wav 2> "hammer" ;

>If a process grabs CPU time when an image is being displayed, the
>corresponding inaccuracy in timing is reported as a display error. But what

   The frame that plays a sound is another frame, if it's late the error 
will get logged.

>  It may be
>that my question doesn't actually make sense - is the clock always started
>at the true onset of a sound file in this case, please?

   The clock is started when the command to issue the sound file is 
given.  It's possible that there's a lag between them but that's a 
multi-tasking OS for you, no way around that.  On the up side the delay 
isn't likely to be anything more than a few milliseconds, look at the 
millisecond timer tests in TimeDX, the time between callbacks will give you 
a good feel for the likely error.  Of course, there's also the time it 
takes your sound subsystem to start playing the file and is in fact a far 
greater concern than any random synchronicity affects.  You'll want to 
measure that latency with the TimeDX Sound Latency Test.

   Well, not the <Justify> anyway, that one is just something that happens 
to have gotten in my way without me noticing it.  There's a bunch of code 
in one of my script generators that wouldn't be there if I had thought of 
<Justify> when writing the script generator -- instead it reads all the 
various bitmaps it references to get their size in order to position them, 
if <Justify> was used that script generator would be a whole lot simpler.

Is it possible to use bmp files as feedback?  I tried <cfb g"picfile">, but
it didn't seem to work.

thanks in advance for any help

Great - thanks for all the advice, Jonathan. This will be useful - hope it
is for other people, as well.

Best wishes,

Hi,

I have some difficulties using analysing tools. I don't understand what =
"concatenate" and "unloadazk" stand for and don't see how to chain these =
different tools.
Would somebody have an example of an entire analysis using these tools?

In "analyse" it seems that you can't use ? or * to specify your =
conditions. This could be useful for people coding conditions in item =
number. For instance item 102612 is item number 26 in condition 1 for =
factor 1 and condition 2 for factor 2. So condition 11 could be =
described as 1???11.

Is it possible to apply a cutoff and then the 2 standard deviations for =
excluding bizarre items?


Thanks in advance.

   Yeah, this has occurred to me as shortcoming.  Such a thing was never 
possible before the long item numbers of DMDX and ANALYZE mimics much older 
programs so naturally it doesn't allow for such a thing.  But there's no 
reason it couldn't.

I am using zil because I want to have both latency to the button press and 
the button release recorded (I know the keyboard does not provide accurate 
timing and will switch to input through the PIO after I understand the 
basics of using zil.)

If I run this script and respond by pressing 3 to all three items.  The 
online feedback indicates correct or incorrect.  However, I do not get any 
indication of correct or incorrect in the output file (I know that using 
AZK, a negative before RT indicates incorrect but that does not to appear 
to be the case for zil).  Here is the output from this test:

Subject 1, 10/26/2001 14:35:44 on Stim1, refresh 16.56ms
Item 1
  1186.07,+3 1292.24,-3
**********************************************************************
THERE WERE MORE THAN 2 EVENTS, DATA LOSS WILL HAVE OCCURED
**********************************************************************
Item 2
  386.31,+3 482.14,-3
**********************************************************************
THERE WERE MORE THAN 2 EVENTS, DATA LOSS WILL HAVE OCCURED
**********************************************************************
Item 3
  324.39,+3 442.77,-3
**********************************************************************
THERE WERE MORE THAN 2 EVENTS, DATA LOSS WILL HAVE OCCURED
**********************************************************************

Eventually, I want a script that can handle eleven different responses, 
mapping 10 of them to positive, and one to negative.  I want the output 
file to indicate the actual button press (which it does) and also correct 
or incorrect (which it does not).  Suggestions?

Thanks for the help

Thanks,
I finally found kenneth's mail about the release.
I think that it could be useful  for novices to include it in the
dmdxutils.zip.

However I still don't understand why first I concatenate my datas with
unloadazk in one azk file and then "analyse" asks me an rtf file.

I would have thought that analyse would have needed the big azk file and
would have computed the mean for all my conditions in one time.

I think that as I had'nt use dmaster, I'm missing something.

   So it can determine the item's structure and include it in the 
output.  UnloadAZK is only of relevance when you are gathering data from 
more than one machine.

   It does.

So if my experiment is composed of two counterbalanced rtf files, I'll have
to run analyse twice and only then I'll merge  the means with concatenate.

My first thought was that you merge the two azk files first and then you run
only once "analyse".

Is there any way by which analyse could detect left-handed subject?
For instance, with azk2txt I detected them if their name was "GAUCH" and
then count "-" as good answer.

   Yes.  But such changes as this and your request to item number ranges 
are going to require sponsorship before I do them.

   I'd argue that the item file would be a better place to make such 
determinations though.  Perhaps have two versions in one item file and a 
branch to one or the other.

Why not making your useful softs as "open source" softs? That would
permit other people to participate and could be a way of sponsorship, don't
you think?

   Ken made up some notes that are now included with utilities in 
DMDXUTILS.ZIP:

NOTES on AZK Analysis Programs
------------------------------

	Users of DM/DMTG who were accustomed to the DOS utilities UNLOAD, UPDATE 
and CONCAT, which handled binary output data (.dtp) files, can now use the 
following Windows versions with .azk files.  The advantage of an .azk file 
is that there is no restriction on the number of items, and one can use any 
data analysis package.


(1) UNLOADAZK

This program is designed to transfer .azk files from multiple machines and 
combine them into a single .azk output file.  It replaces the older utility 
UNLOAD.

This program asks for a source file (an .azk file) and a destination.  The 
.azk file is transferred to the new destination, appending the new material 
to any existing file with the same name.  The original file is then renamed 
as an .rdb (raw data backup) file.

(2) ANALYZE

Computes subject and item mean RTs and error rates from .azk files.  It 
replaces the older utility UPDATE.

  The assignment of items to conditions is specified in an 
.spc(specification) file.  This is an ordinary text file, and includes a 
number of parameters which specify computational options (e.g., data 
trimming, error rate criterion for exclusion of subjects, analyze only 
incorrect responses, etc). ANALYZE produces for each .azk file two output 
files: (a)  an .ism (item summary) file, which lists the mean RT and error 
rates for each item in each condition, and (b) a .das file, which has 
exactly the same format as the original .das files.  See below for an example.

(3) CONCATENATE

Combines data from several .das files in a suitable fashion for input to 
ANOVA programs. This replaces the former utility CONCAT.

The method of concatenation is specified in a .cat file which lists the 
name of the .das file, and the conditions to be selected from it.  See 
below for an example.

Each program has its own HELP function.  Pressing COPY will copy the 
contents to the clipboard.

Download these programs from:

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/dmdxutils.zip

===========================================================================================

Example of an .spc file:
------------------------

This file contains a number of key words specifying options.  Any line with 
# at the beginning is a comment.  In the following example, explanatory 
comments are appended after each key word.

				==== * ====== * =======

title: Priming Experiment 1
# any text appearing after "title:" will be used as a title.

discard_display_errors
# if there was a display error on an item, the data from this trial is 
discarded.
# any option can be turned off either by deleting the line, or
# by inserting # at the beginning of the line, e.g.,
#discard_display_errors

subject_rejection: 20
# an option for specifying the highest percent error rate that
# will be included.
# In this example, subjects making 20% errors or more over
# all items being analyzed would be automatically rejected.

data_threshold: 2.0
# any RTs more than 2.0 S.D. units away from the overall mean RT for each 
subject
# will be trimmed, either by setting it equal to the cutoff value (the 
default),
# or by exclusion (see next option).  Delete the above line or comment it out
# if you don't want any data trimming.

data_rejection
#  any RTs selected by the above data_threshold are excluded rather than 
trimmed.

low_cutoff: 200
# RTs faster than 200 ms will be discarded
high_cutoff: 1500
# RTs slower than 1500 ms will be discarded

rt_width: 7
rt_precision: 1
# specifies the output format of the .das file. rt_width is the number of
# columns (default 5), and rt_precision is the number of decimals (default 0).

analyze_incorrect_responses
# use this if you want to analyze only the incorrect responses.

# now follows the item assignments.

condition: 1	
name: c1
description: Semantically related prime	
items: 1-9 11 12
#  This allows you to specify a name and a description for each condition,
#  and to specify which items belong to this condition.
#  In this example, condition 1 is named "c1", and the
#  the description of the condition is "Sematically related prime".
#  The items to be included are 1 to 9, 11, and 12.


condition: 2	
name: c2
description:	Unrelated prime		
items:14-16 18 19-26

#  etc., for each remaining condition.

======================================================================================

Example of a .cat file
----------------------

title: low density targets
# this will appear on the .ism and .das file

rt_width: 7
rt_precision: 1
# as in the .spc file

dasfile: exp1a.das
# the first input file is the file "exp1a.das"

subject: 1-3
# the first three columns of the output file will list the subject
# mean RTs and the error rates for the first
# three conditions of the file "exp1a.das".

dasfile: exp1b.das
#  the second input file is the file "exp1b.das"

subject: 1-3
#  columns 4-6 of the output file will contain the subject
#  mean RTs and error rates for conditions 1-3 of exp1b.das

# the above will generate two data matrices each with N rows
# (equal to the number of subjects) and 6 columns,
# corresponding to the conditions specified above.  The first
#  matrix contains mean RTs, the second error rates.

#  if you also wish to have item mean RTs and error rates
#  included in the output, you need to specify a new
#  combination.  This usually will not match the specification
#  for the subject means in a counterbalanced design, in which
#  different groups of subjects receive counterbalanced items.
#  In the following example, a counterbalanced design is assumed.

dasfile: exp1a.das
# this is the input file
item: 1
#  output the item mean RTs and error rates for condition 1
#  in file exp1a.das

dasfile: exp1b.das
item: 2
#  output the item mean RTs and error rates for condition 2
#  in file exp1b.das


dasfile: exp1b.das
item: 1
dasfile: exp1a.das
item:2

# same as above, except reversed.

         These utilities were designed for users of DM/DMTG who were 
accustomed to using binary data output (.dtp) files.  In that system, 
UPDATE accepted a .dtp file as input, analyzed the data, and generated 
another binary file as output (.dat). To convert data from a binary file 
into an ascii file, the DOS program CONCAT accepted input from multiple 
.dat files and combined selected conditions from these files into one ascii 
output file (.das).

         The newer Windows program ANALYZE now analyzes the data in an .azk 
file, and produces an ascii .das file for each .rtf file.  CONCATENATE 
allows you to combine conditions from these files into one file for input 
to ANOVA programs.  There are many other utilities that allow you to do the 
same thing, not to mention any text editor.

         UNLOADAZK replaces the former utility UNLOAD, and facilitates the 
transfer and updating of .azk files from multiple machines.  One can have 
.azk files with the same name on different machines, and combining them 
into one file involves a tedious operation of appending and renaming. 
UNLOADAZK does this automatically.

         The principle virtue of the current scheme is that the .cat file 
and the .spc file leave a record of exactly how the data were analyzed.

         Evidently, I neglected to include explanatory notes in the 
dmdxutils.zip file.  This has now been rectified.

         So it could.  But I see this as a needless complication.  If you 
are using Excel to construct your item files, numbering of items can be 
handled automatically.  I have seen many errors introduced by keying in the 
wrong item number.

>
>Is it possible to apply a cutoff and then the 2 standard deviations for 
>excluding bizarre items?

         Yes.  Specifying the low_cutoff and the high_cutoff in the .spc 
file excludes data exceeding the cutoffs.  The SD cutoff is then calculated 
on the remaining data.

   Well, here's the other half of the big update.  Introduced is expression 
evaluation in <set> and branching with <BranchIf>, emitting text into the 
data file with <emit text>, attention studies are made possible with 
<lookingtime> and a bug that must have been in DMTG and thus inherited by 
DMDX was dealt with where continuous running has been set and an 
instruction has a branch over non-zero item numbers and then DMDX doesn't 
stop waiting for a request as it should at the end of the instruction.

Set Counter Keyword

<SetCounter CounterN=expression>
<set CounterN=expression>
<SetCounter cN=expression>
<set cN=expression>

deprecated usage:
<SetCounter N1,N2>
<set N1,N2>
<SetCounter N,text>
<set N,text>


     Preferred usage evaluates expression using a modified and 
significantly expanded version of CALC.C that Bob Brodt wrote in 1985 and 
assigns the result to CounterN. First deprecated usage sets Counter N1 to 
value N2, second deprecated usage sets counter N to some value depending on 
the string text . Counters are used to control branching in DMDX, more 
specifically for building looping mechanisms. Before a counter can be used 
it must be setup at least once with a <SetCounter> keyword, after that it 
can be incremented or decremented, conditionally incremented or decremented 
depending on the subjects response (see the Branching keywords for a full 
list of possibilities), emitted into the output file, tested against with 
the Branching keywords or set to another value with <SetCounter> again. 
Counter's values are signed 32 bit integers.

     Possible tokens in expression and values for text are:

CounterN The value of counter N, for example <set 3,counter2> would set 
(and create if necessary) counter 3 to the value counter 2 had when this 
keyword is parsed.
cN Synonym for CounterN
LastRT Absolute value of the last Reaction Time gathered in whole 
milliseconds (rounded down). Because expressions are evaluated as the item 
is parsed this RT is the previous item's RT, not the RT that might be 
gathered by the item the expression is in.
LastXT Last Reaction Time (previous item) gathered in whole milliseconds 
(rounded down). This will be negative if the response was incorrect.
ErrorRate The error rate at the end of the previous item (useful for 
multiple tests against the error rate as a branch on the error rate will 
reset it).

     Rules regarding evaluation of expression are as follows:

* Calculator program - 9 May 1985
*     Bob Brodt
*     34 Mehrhof Rd.
*     Little Ferry, NJ 07643
*     (201)-641-9582
*
* This is a simple integer arithmetic calculator program. It uses infix
* notation, i.e. 1+2*3 as opposed to "reverse polish" notation: 1 2 3 * +.
*
* CONSTANTS:
*     Numbers may be input as in C using 0x notation for hex, and a
*     leading zero for octal, everything else is assumed to be decimal.
*     DMDX constants at time of evaluation: lastrt lastxt errorrate
* VARIABLES:
*     DMDX counters referenced by counterN or cN
* OPERATORS:
*     The following operators are supported (from highest precedence to 
lowest):
*
*     ( )             associativity
*     ~ !             one's complement, logical NOT
*     * / %             multiply, divide and modulo
*     + -             unary and binary add & subtract
*     .SHL. .SHR.         shift left and right
*     .LT. .GT. .LE. .GE.     less than, greater than, less than or equal 
to and
*                     greater than or equal to
*     .EQ. .NE.         equal to and not equal to
*     &             bitwise AND
*     ^             bitwise exclusive OR
*     |             bitwise inclusive OR
*     .AND.             logical AND
*     .OR.             logical OR
*     =             assignment
*     ,             comma - separates function arguments
*
*     All operators associate from left to right with the exception of
*     the assignment (=) operator. Logical operations resolve to 1 if true 
and 0
*     if false.
* FUNCTIONS:
*     The calculator also has built-in function capabilities:
*     max(a, b) - larger of a or b
*     min(a, b) - smaller of a or b
*     abs(a) - absolute value of a
*     random(a) - random number between 0 and a-1

     Typical use of a counter involves setting it to some initial value and 
decrementing it and using one of the counter branching keywords <bicGT> 
till the counter reaches 0. In the following item 10 will be displayed five 
times:

0 "looping demo" <set c1 = 5>;
+10 * "display" <dec 1> <bicGT 1,0,-10>;
0 "end";

     Possible things to be aware of are that expressions, non conditional 
arithmetic (<inc> and <dec> ) and most other actions in counter related 
keywords are performed as the item is parsed before display so multiple 
uses of those keywords in the same item are possible, conditional 
arithmetic keywords (<incic>, <inciw>, <incinr>, <decic>, <deciw>, <decinr> 
) however are evaluated after the item is displayed and the RT gathered 
(thus necessitating special control structures within DMDX) and are limited 
to one operation per counter per item, in the case of multiple uses only 
the last will have any effect. Branches (<bicGT> and <bicLE>) are evaluated 
at the beginning of the next item after everything else.



Branch If Keyword

<BranchIf N,expression>
<bi N,expression>

variant:
Call If Keyword

<CallIf N,expression>
<ci N,expression>

     If expression evaluates to a non-zero value the next item to be 
processed will be item number N. See <Branch> and <SetCounter>.




Looking Time Keyword

<LookingTime N,text>
<lt N,text>

     Parameter and switch to turn on the Looking Time features of DMDX, 
loads counter N with the time key text was pressed during each trial. If N 
is -1 then the RT for that trial is set instead of a counter. This is a 
special extension of the <Zillion> input mode that sums the time a key was 
pressed while the clock was on, multiple counters and keys can be bound per 
trial. The name text can either be +buttonname or -buttonname, either will 
do as both names are used to determine if a key is pressed. Counters do not 
have to be initialized with <SetCounter> before hand (they couldn't be on 
the parameter line in any event) and can be stored in the data file with 
<EmitCounter>.
     A little care is needed if <Emit> is to be used as <Emit> emits the 
counter's value as the item is parsed, before any RTs are gathered so a 
<Call> is necessitated. The following example monitors two looking times, 
one with the 1 key and the other with the 2 key, it also sets the RT to the 
first looking time:

<ep> f70 <id keyboard> <zil> t20000
<lt -1,+1> <lt 1,+1> <lt 2,+2> <eop>

0 "This is the Looking Time Test Item file" <bu 999>;
10 <emit 1><emit 2><return>;
~999 <medialife 999> <dv> "movie.mpg" ;

+1 "+" / * <dv> "movie.mpg" <call -10> c;
+2 "+" / * <dv> "movie.mpg" <call -10> c;




Emit Counter Keyword

<EmitCounter N>
<emit N>
<emit text>

     The counter number N's value is emitted into the output data file 
(.azk or .zil). Should N be omitted and text provided instead (the first 
character of text not being numeric) then text will be emitted.

Hi,
First of all the calculator is very very great!!!!

But I don't understand why the following script is working well with dmdx
2.502 and not with dmdx 2.6 (it doesn't display the last line Merci and
below the error rate and quit suddenly)

I'd like to display at the end of some blocks, the mean error rate and
simultaneously the mean rt to the subject. Is it possible to display on the
screen the value of a counter?
If not, is there another way to do it?

   Well you call item 99 and then fall into 99, but while malformed I don't 
see that it should stop the display.  And then there's the invalid close 
bracket at the end of every item from 10% onwards.  Can't guess what that 
does.  Another thing to do is to turn on <BranchDiagnostics> to debug a 
complicated branching script.

   Nope, just the crude binned fashion that you're using for the RT.  I've 
yet to think of a half way elegant mechanism to do it but it's something I 
want to add so no doubt some mechanism will occur to me in the next few 
days and we'll see something next week.

Dear All,
Hi, I'm having problems with running .mov files in DMDX. The files play =
but the sound and the picture appear to be out of sync. It seems that =
the frames are playing faster than the audio. What might be the reason =
for this?
Please help...

   Update all the codecs -- easiest way to do that might be to get the 
latest Windows Media player.  How fast is the computer?  If it's not the 
fastest thing around the place update it.  If none of those get it convert 
the files to some other format.  .MOV is a Macintosh format and as such 
basically sucks on a PC.

Append Counter Keyword

<AppendCounter N>
<apc N>

     When this keyword is included in a frame the value of counter N (see 
<SetCounter>) will be appended to the current frame's display.

     If you wish to change the formatting of the counter make sure the RTF 
formatting does not end with the quotes, for example to have a completely 
green display the following would be required:
/ "counter 1: " <apc 1> /

   You'll have look at the source for that example to make any sense:

   People might want to look out using that one,  I just thought of a hole 
in the code during morning meditation that I will have to fix in a couple 
of hours.  If DMDX starts reporting invalid switches 0..9 in the frame 
following the frame with <apc> that's the error.  I did say it was tricky...

Hi all,

I'm getting an error message during syntax check. When it hits the first =
item line, it says:

Failed to CreateSample
VFW_S_RESOURCE_NOT_NEEDED (888760250)
The resource specified is no longer needed

I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me what this means. I'm using =
DMDX version 2.2.00, on a PC (windows 98), DirectX 7.0, and I'm trying =
to run .mov files in my experiment. I've checked that the files are in =
the same folder as the script and DMDX.exe.

Many thanks,
Helen
(still struggling with DMDX)

Hi,

We (CBU Cambridge, UK) are using DMDX for most of our imaging (fMRI) 
experiments. A problem with this is that the experiment must be scanner 
paced. The scanner sends a pulse everytime it scans a volume (basically a 
picture of the subject's head), and usually a number of volumes are scanned 
within each trial. The next trial should only start when the first scanner 
pulse is received. The scanner pulses are connected to the Bit0 channel of 
the PIO12 card, so will by default be interpreted as request button presses.

The problem is that it can be extremely difficult to get a response time 
from the subject and count scanner pulses at the same time. We couldn't 
find another way then by making each trial precisely the same length, so 
that we know how many scanner pulses happen during the trial, and then wait 
for the correct number of extra pulses before starting the next trial.

Does somebody have a better solution for this? The perfect solution would 
probably be to be able to connect a counter to an input channel (a bit like 
the lookingtime keyword), and then have a keyword that made DMDX wait until 
this counter reached a certain value before starting each trial (and then 
also resetting it to 0).

Thanks,

Maarten

   What does it do when the item file runs as opposed to being syntax 
checked?  Same error message?  Sounds to me like you're going to have to 
give up using .MOV files and use something else.  I've had no trouble with 
.MPG or .AVI files.  You might want to download the latest Quick Time 
viewer from Apple.

   We tend to trigger the scanner here to avoid such problems.  I won't be 
adding a keyword to do what you want unless you want to buy us a big hard 
disk and even then it's a whopper, I may well find a reason not to do 
it.  I would suggest that crafting a sub routine to count pulses using 
<lookingtime> is the best bet.  You'll want to map only your subject's 
response key as a positive responses and leave Bit0 unmapped.  You'll want 
a subroutine that sets some summing counter to 0 and then has an item that 
displays nothing but turns the clockon for period longer than the interval 
between two pulses and a <lt> to some temporary counter that you'll want to 
sum to summing counter and if the summing counter isn't over your limit 
branch to the item that turns the clock on again otherwise return (not the 
item that sets the sum to zero).

   You'll also want a D0 or something low in the item that does the 
polling.  Probably ten other things I'm not immediately thinking of as well.

Hi all,

As a first post to the list, I'm submitting a TimeDX test with a gamepad
as an input device. The configuration is basically:

PIII 500, 128 RAM, MB with BX chipset, Soundblaster Audigy MP3+ (gameport 
included), running WIN 98SE and DirectX 8.0 The Gamepad is A Genius
MaxFire DigitalForce
G-09 (nice buttons, althoug it isn't so rounded and comfortable). Here are
the DirectInput Results:

Device is polled (0.051 ms) timebase 1 ms

This is the worst result, sometimes it's 0.049. I believe it's ok as an
input device, right? Results are even lower (0.036) in a DELL PIII 700
with 384 RAM and Soundblaster Live Value, running Win 98SE.

Should I use RawJoystick or is it ok with the gamepad? Is the gain so
significant?

If there is interest, I can benchmark the SoundBlaster Audigy (with nice
100 dB SNR). Thanks in advance. []'s

   Not much gain to speak of there, they're both really fast.

   More on getting <AppendCounter> bulletproof.  While having an admittedly 
small, nay, vanishingly small probability of occurring 2.6.03 eliminates 
the chance that an item that has an <apc> frame in it turns a blank frame 
into jibberish.  It would have to cause the item buffer to get reallocated 
by causing the item size to exceed 500 or 100 or 1500 etc characters when 
the counter's characters get added to the frame (where no other item had 
exceeded this limit before) and that item would have to have a blank frame 
_before_ the <apc> frame.  You can see why I get concerned about just gaily 
adding things and where instability can creep in.

Thanks Jonathon,
Yes, it runs! I decided to ignore the error message and run the file anyway,
it works. Why?

(1)  When I try to use <RevertOutput>, I get the error message:  "Misplaced

RevertOutput should be used in the parameter/header line at the top of the
script.  When used it will change the function of the output command (which
you should continue to use in the individual trials as before) from latched
to non-latched with a pulse length (and return value) as indicated in the
revertoutput command.  You will set the actual bit pattern to output with
each output command as before.

I am happy to hear that you are using this new feature.  I have been missing
triggers infrequently (maybe one out of 200 triggers ever other subject) on
the data collection machine that receives the output from DMDX.  I am
currently assuming that it is a hardware issue in my lab and trying to fix
it locally but please let me know if you experience the same problem,
suggesting some problem with using the latched form of output.

Enjoy J

Dear John, thank you for your help.

I stubbornly assumed that <RevertOutput> operated as I wanted it to, as a
'variable-period pulse generating' substitute for <output>.

I will look for 'missed beats' in my trigger system but perhaps you do have
a hardware problem?  I would consider possible mismatches between the logic
circuitry of the PIO output and your triggered device.  You need to know if
your PIO is CMOS (e.g., Keithley PIO-12 made after Nov 1996) or TTL.
Similarly you need to know about the 'input' device.

For examples: (i)  74xx and low power TTL (74Lxx) families cannot directly
drive 4000 CMOS, but 74HCTxx can.
              (ii) 4000 series CMOS can drive TTL as long as the CMOS is
operating at +5 V, otherwise not directly.

Also:  Are there pull-up resistors on the trigger inputs?, or perhaps the
trigger needs to be a positive going pulse, in which case you need pull-down
resistors for noise immunity.

RevertOutput should be used in the parameter/header line at the top of the
script.  When used it will change the function of the output command (which
you should continue to use in the individual trials as before) from latched
to non-latched with a pulse length (and return value) as indicated in the
revertoutput command.  You will set the actual bit pattern to output with
each output command as before.

I am happy to hear that you are using this new feature.  I have been missing
triggers infrequently (maybe one out of 200 triggers ever other subject) on
the data collection machine that receives the output from DMDX.  I am
currently assuming that it is a hardware issue in my lab and trying to fix
it locally but please let me know if you experience the same problem,
suggesting some problem with using the latched form of output.

Enjoy J

DMDX version 2.6.03

(1)  When I try to use <RevertOutput>, I get the error message:  "Misplaced
parameter keyword <REVERTOUTPUT> in item".

(2)  I don't understand the syntax of the <RevertOutput> command.  The
'Manual' specifies a call in the form:  <ro F, H>
     but this does not include a parameter for the output port bit, e.g., as
in <Output O> <REM activate bit 0 of port C>

Now, I'm not the type to "blame America first" so I plead ... what am I
doing wrong?


Example, the code which offendeth:
<n 1> <azk> <fd 0> <cr> <dbc 0> <id PIO12> <d 0> <dwc 255255255> <vm 800 600

1 <RevertOutput 1000, H> /;

   Only thing I can theorize is that that the Apple Quick Time codec has 
somehow decided that a video buffer is not needed for that media.  At first 
I was thinking that perhaps the file you were throwing at it had no video 
component and was just audio in which case the <StreamingAudio> keyword 
should be used.  But if it runs in a normal fashion the only thing I can 
guess is that the QT codec is smart enough to somehow determine that DMDX 
hasn't switched to a DDraw video mode and so therefore can't possibly be 
wanting the video information.  Which is daft, I might want to process the 
data or send it over the network without displaying it.  But that's Apple 
for you, they know best. I ran a syntax check on the digital video demo 
yesterday and it was fine so the .MPG and .AVI codec are fine.

   Hmm, if you're using a value of 5ms I'd be less likely to think that 
somehow DMDX is reverting the output too quickly even though I put special 
effort into making sure that if it made a mistake the pulse would get 
longer.  But I guess it's possible that something is interrupting the code 
that sends the pulse after it has read the clock and so when it adds 5 
milliseconds to set the time for the event that reverts the output it is 
already past that time so it actually reverts the output in 
microseconds.  That is however assuming that something _can_ interrupt that 
piece of code and to the best of my knowledge it's running at kernal 
priority and is therefore not interruptible.  What is the SD that that 
machine reports in the Video and Millisecond test?  What's the largest 
interval that it reports between callbacks?  You might also want to try 
turning on <TestMode 2> and compare the values.  The larger that largest 
time between callbacks value is the larger the revert time should be.  You 
probably want to try a value like 15ms in any event.  I can cook up another 
test mode that monitors how much time is spent in the millisecond callback 
which would provide definitive information.  OTOH, it could just be that 
5ms is just a little too rapid a pulse to get through the wiring in your lab.

   Sorry, but I spend a lot of time writing those docs and 90% of the 
questions I get asked are answered in the docs.  I'm not going to argue 
that they're easy to read, but then I'm not going to argue that DMDX is 
easy to use either.  I don't care if people don't understand the docs as 
they are reading them, I don't fully understand the DirectX docs when I 
have to read them.  However at some level the information gets in and if at 
a later stage I am having trouble there's a niggly little feeling that I've 
read something somewhere that describes the trouble I am having so I feel 
confidant that if I dive into the docs I'll find the answer somewhere.

In the study I am working on, we are timing every item. However, I've 
noticed that this creates a large lag between the items.
How do you write the program, so that the lag between the items is 
removed, yet every item is still being timed?

   Use the D parameter.  A D-2 in the parameter line will reduce the ISI to 
2 ticks or a bit longer if DMDX needs the time to prepare the item.

I notice that the standard deviation of the millisecond callback under ME

I inserted the <d> parameter, we prefer <d 0> to <d 2>. Even with the 
d parameter, there is still a lag between items, it is smaller, yet 
it remains. Also, the length of the lag seems to be affected by the 
length of the upcoming sentence. In the study, every item is being 
timed.

My questions:

1. Is the length between items affected by the length of the upcoming sentence?

2. Does the timing of the item begin after the spacebar has been 
pressed, or when the sentence appears on the screen?

3. How do you make the items left-justified on the screen, rather 
than centered?

thanks everyone,

I would like to use DMDX with 2 computer monitors - one for the subject
stimulus display and the other for the experimenter to interact with the
computer (e.g., run different DMDX item files).

The no brainer answer is to use a 'display adapter splitter' which drives 2
monitors from one display adapter card.  'Cheap and does exactly what I
need.

But why make life simple?  Is it possible to use DMDX in Windows' dual
monitor configuration where the computer has two display adapter cards?

Thanks,

   Yeah, the help files document this, the updates page mentions tested 
configurations and points you in directions to find out what likely 
combinations of cards are likely to work.

   It begins when the frame with the * in it is displayed.  In your case 
because there is a delay of 0 it's going to be within a few tens of 
milliseconds of the spacebar being pressed depending on your system's 
speed.  You can determine roughly how long that is by looking at the 
preparation times in the diagnostics.

>Also, is the length betwee items affected by the length of the upcoming 
>sentence?

   Only trivially, most machines can prepare a sentence for display in less 
than 10 milliseconds, some very old ones might take 20.

   BTW, <fd>'s parameter is an integer value in ticks (retrace intervals).

So it can only be something like 21 or 22, not 21.5?

   Yes, integers are whole numbers, real numbers can have a fractional 
component.

I use french keyboard and I can't use backspace in dmdx =
(ZillionTypedResponses) neither then "q" (it gives an "a").
I installed first an english version of directx and after that the last =
french version (8.1) but that doesn't change anything.

Thanks in advance.

Perhaps Boris's problem with "on Q A"  would resolve using Windows'
alternative language mappings for keyboards?

   I don't know that the Q/A problem is resolvable by something other than 
a kludge as DMDX uses the implicit assumption that the names of the keys 
that DirectX provides are correct (something you're not supposed to 
do).  If I complain to MS they'll just say 'told ya so'.
   The thing to do under these circumstances is to use the TimeDX input 
test and to see just what key triggers what DirectX button event.  The 
backspace issue is the same issue that the 'zillion enter key name' keyword 
resolves, I guess I'll have to add a 'zillion backspace key name' keyword.
   The only immediate solution to the Q/A issue that comes to mind is to 
provide a list of alternate lookups.  However we have no French Keyboard 
issues around here but instead do have a need for a 60 gigabyte disk...

Finally the backspace problem is not one if we use the english directx. (I
didn't think that these two problems were independant).

And for the "q a" problem, the solution (not a perfect one for the accent
but...) would be to use a qwerty keyboard.

So I only see disadvantages to install localized version of directx.

   I don't think it's the version of DirectX, I think it's the keyboard, or 
at least the way you have the keyboard installed.  If you look in the 
Device Manager see if the keyboard is listed as French keyboard, if so, 
delete it and install a US or Standard MS keyboard.

Dear Jonathan,
Most of the documentation for DMDX suggests that it should be run on
Windows 95/98 and this is indeed what we use in our lab. However, for
demonstartion purposes we wish to install the software on some machines
which run only Windows 2000.

I see from the mailing list that some people do use Windows 2000. So, I
would be grateful to know if, generally speaking DMDX runs OK on Windows
2000.

Many thanks.
Billi

Hi Billi,

>From experience here at the CBU, DMDX does run under Windows 2000, however,
there is an important restriction for us, which is that the PIO12 input
card does not work.

So, running a demonstration on Win 2K would be fine, but you would not be
able to use a PIO12 button box to record responses. Responses measured with
the keyboard or mouse would be fine (though see the TimeDX help file for
some suggestion that response latencies may be more variable).
Alternatively, you should be able to get accurate response times using an
button box connected to the joystick port. 

Does anyone have experience of using joystick input devices with DMDX and
Win2K?

Cheers,

Matt

I've been running it on Win2000 and experienced no problems that I'm aware
of. (I didn't ever try running it on Win95/98 though so I don't have
anything to compare it to.)

I am not confident that I am writing DMDX script in the most efficient
manner because I am plagued by "1-tick-late" display errors and "DQ adjusted
1 ticks for sound".  While these do not seem to have a practical impact on
what I am trying to do, I nevertheless fear that they are symptomatic of an
underlying coding flaw (mine).

I have played quite a bit with the tuning of my 8-MB ATI video card to
little avail, and the demands placed on the 200 Mhz Pentium seem light.

This is the kind of thing I am doing -- 5 types of reaction time trials with
differing pre-target cues (audio and character-display "O") and a set ISI
for each trial.  RT's are gathered from a PIO input and the PIO also
functions as an output device to deliver triggers to a recording device.

QUESTIONS:
(1)  Is there a place for <DELAY> in this continuous running experiment?
The help files say so, but I cannot grasp how to meaningfully employ them.
(2)  am I correct in assuming that specifying all time intervals in ticks is
more efficient and timing-error resistant than using times specified in ms.?
(e.g., <fd> vs. <%ms>)


Thanks,

   It's the D0.  D0 means take as much time as you need to load images but 
then display the results immediately.  A D-2 means the same thing but 
schedule the display 2 ticks later thus giving DMDX and the OS a little 
spare time to do any house keeping that might be needed.

   Sure, you're using it in one of the envisaged fashions.

   Yes, far superior.  The millisecond specification is only provided for 
non-technical users or for when it doesn't really matter and you couldn't 
be bothered figuring out how long a long time interval is in ticks.  Also 
good for writing machine independent but non timing critical item files.

I wouldn't run it in Windows 2000 if you're planning to use the PIO 12 for 
triggering an external device (e.g. for ERPs, for example).  I also suspect 
that audio events will have quite a bit of temporal jitter in Windows 2000.

   Until someone buys the development kit from ComputerBoards the PIO12 is 
not going to be available under 2k or XP.  Audio performance could be 
better under XP, haven't tested it yet.

Thanks! That worked very well. However, now it goes straight to the 
first line of the following sentence. I guess one way around this is 
making the first line a blank like. It's done to give people a break 
if needed.

Is there any code, however, that would accomplish the same goal? And 
if there is such a code, what is the parameter?

   The <cr> in the parameter line is what is doing it, remove it and it 
will wait for a request (usu. the space bar).

  I would leave the <cr> in the parameter line, and terminate each sentence
with an instruction.  For example:

+001 *"The sentence";
+002 * "begins here, ";
+003 * "and ends here.";
0 ;

Continuous running is designed to keep going until it hits an instruction.

Watch out for scrambling.  The easiest solution is to use the g parameter.
 Set this equal to the number of items in the longest sentence, and then
pad all the other sentences to make them the same length by adding dummy
items, e.g.,

+001 *"The sentence";
+002 * "begins here, ";
+003 * "and ends here.";
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 ;

This assumes that the longest sentence is seven items long, and that g =
7.  The c in each instruction tells DMDX to go on to the next item without
waiting for a new request.

Hi,
	I noticed that 1.3.01 DMDX was available so I decided to try it out and 
have been having trouble since.  I installed it over a working copy of DMDX 
but some things seem to be no longer working.

The "features" example will not run and keeps telling me I need to get into 
the Advanced/Vertical Retrace Sync thread/Antipating the vertical retrace 
and tune some values.  I've done this (more than once) but its not 
working.  It says something about not finding the reg key for 
<SOFTWARE\TimeDX\0 Primary Display Driver\640X480(480)_16bpp_0Hz>

Can someone explain what I'm doing wrong or suggest where I should be looking.

I have also noticed that the 'joystick' input test is not doing what I 
expect.  I only get one of the 3 buttons to work but it was fine in the old 
version.  If I got to the PIO test I get all 3 buttons working.  Now I 
never tried the PIO test in the past (only use Joystick input so never saw 
the need) so is this something I'm doing wrong?

I'm sure its me, I'm sure I must have missed something but I dont need to 
loose any more hair :-)
Thanks in advance

-Put on dumb face -

OK, now I have realised that 1.3.01 is old.  How I managed to get such an 
old version I am not sure.  I'll try downloading it again and see what is 
happening but I am still suprised it does not work.

I'll get back to the list when I have tried an current version.

Sorry

Hi=20
I am running a task with backward masking.
The interesting thing is I can get the program to run with a vm 640 480, =
480,160 etc but when I use vm 1024, 768, 768,16,0 the program completes =
two complete instructions but then jumps back to the beginning statement =
eg  0 "push spacebar". It then proceeds to attempt to continue with =
instruction 3  to the end which by this time is scrambled.
It seems to depend on what vm instructions I insert in the program as to =
whether it branches back to the beginning=20

I would really appreciate some guidance here=20

thanking you Arch Tibben=20

   Your video card probably doesn't have the memory to handle that video 
mode.  If it does then the drivers are malfunctioning and it's time to see 
if there are some updates for the video card.  If there are no updated 
drivers then you will have to use the -buffer N command line option to 
limit the number of back buffers that DMDX uses to something the developers 
might have tested, like 3 or 2.  You can see how many back buffers are 
being used in the diagnostics after an item file has been run.

Hi Jonathan
Thanks, I have updated my drivers.
Thanks heaps. it works!

I have another question though about the buffer command Although I did not
need to use it, where in the command line would I put this instruction.
I tried to put the instruction in the item file and it came up as an error.
is there a chance you can  give me an example of accessing the command file
with this instruction. My diagnostic suggested that I required 20 buffers??

Kind regards Arch

  y

   Change the target from:

C:\dx2\DmDX\dmdx.exe

   to:

C:\dx2\DmDX\dmdx.exe -buffer 4

   It was using 20 buffers.  "Normal" graphical programs would almost never 
use more than 2 back buffers so when DMDX comes along and uses up to 24 (24 
before I felt I should draw a limit somewhere...) it tends to break new 
drivers.  In the GeForce's case it uses hardware to handle back buffers and 
it only has enough hardware for 4 back buffers, beyond that the drivers 
just fall over instead of indicating to DMDX that that's not 
possible.  NVIDIA refuse to address this and I can't say I blame them, 
adding a whole software back buffer code path just for DMDX is silly -- but 
it would be nice if they gracefully handled the condition instead of just 
failing catastrophically.

I was wondering if anyone can help me with a (hopefully) simple question.
I'm setting up an fMRi study with DMDX and, I need to make sure that the
timing of the stimuli is exactly spot on.  I'm not recording any responses,
so I can't use <rcot>.  Can anyone suggest another way more accurate than a
stopwatch?

Many thanks,
sam

RCOT is the right thing to use for measuring timing. It will be much more
accurate than a stopwatch and shouldn't interfere with the running of the
script.

If you set the time-out to a very low value (e.g. <t 10>) then recording a
response adds a very minimal overhead, and shouldn't alter the timing of
your script. Simply add a * to one frame of each item and you can then use
the clock-on time output as usual.

If you're really concerned about not measuring response time when you run
your experiment 'for real', then you could always test the timing of the
script in this way, and then remove the clock-on symbols before testing
subjects.

Hope this helps,

Matt

   Not sure if people really understood the import of my last message about 
Windows ME but Ken sure didn't so I'll spell it out fully, it's timing of 
RTs is far superior to any other 9x flavors of windows, 95, 98 and 
98SE.  The SD of the millisecond callback under Windows ME is 0.08ms on the 
machine I tested which is as good as anything Windows 2000 ever 
produced.  It's in another ballpark compared to what we're testing and 
because it's a 9x kernal you can actually use a PIO12 whereas the drivers 
to use a PIO12 under win2k haven't been written yet.  While I've only 
tested one machine so far ME is so good I'm seriously thinking of updating 
any machine we're using for DMDX that has the disk space to run it -- and 
there's the kicker, you've got to have something like 1Gb free...

   And speaking of OSes that take gazoodles of disk space I just tested 
DMDX on the multi-processor XP machine I just built at home and it's 
running just fine.  This is a different scenario for DMDX because with two 
processors it can now have two threads active at once whereas beforehand 
only one of it's threads was ever active at one time.  I'm happy to say 
that my multi-threaded design is indeed robust and it survives, nay thrives 
in the new environment (not really surprising as I put a lot of effort into 
making sure it would however it has never been tested).  While the SD was 
only 0.16ms (not as good as uni-processor systems) one slightly interesting 
thing was that the mean of the millisecond callback was down to 0.92ms 
during one of the DMDX testmode tests.  This is no great worry as it just 
means that RTs gathered are just that bit more accurate.

   Not that it affects anything but it's interesting to note that the 
timebase of the high performance counter under uni-processor XP goes up to 
3.5MHz but on the dual processor machine it's the clockspeed of the CPUs, 
in this case 1.4 gigahertz, not megahertz anymore.  I had to look at that 
one a few times to realize what was happening.

Dearly Beloved,

  jcf and I have written an article for BRMIC on DMDX, in part rebutting
Myors' absurd comments about the impossibility of accurate response and display
timing under Windows.



  One reviewer complained that he/she was completely unable to get DMDX to
browse the hard disk.  We'd like to know how many other users experienced
this problem.

Dearly Beloved,

  Sorry about that -- I'm using a stupid WebMail program that will do almost
anything with a slight error in keypressing.

  I was starting to explain that our concern is that researchers trying to
publish papers using DMDX might run into problems if Myors' claims are not
answered.  A reviewer might well say about your paper "...however, it is
well known that it is very difficult to obtain accurate response or display
timing with programs such as DMDX running under Windows 98  (e.g., Myors,
1999)".  So we are providing something that you can cite as a rebuttal.

  The editor of BRMIC asked that we provide more examples of scripts.  We
are including one or two pointers in the article, but it is obvious that
a complete coverage would produce a very long paper.  So I want to compile
a list of example scripts that we can put on the web.  Of course, this will
also be very useful to us all.

  So, anybody that uses the PIO to control ERP or fMRI scanners, send us
your scripts (along with an explanation of exactly what the script does and
how).  If you like to use complex scrambling, send us your script!  If you
like to use variables and branching, send us a simple example and an explanation.
 No need to send the entire file, just a few typical examples.  Please include
.wav files for subtle sound presentations, especially when synced to visual
probes.  Same for video files.

  I don't know about you, but I find that other people's scripts are fascinating.
 I had no idea that DMDX could do these things!  I think we all have a lot
to learn from each other.

  So, please -- send me your scripts.  Don't reply to this.  Send your gems

(1)  Actually, I wish people would respond to the list with their scripts!
I find application examples invaluable in learning and mastering programming
and script coding.  The DMDX help pages would be easier for me if more
examples were included of DMDX function calls, etc ....  These really belong
on a tutorial web site and perhaps I will start such a beast if people are
interested in participating (I don't have any actual content to contribute
at this stage of my development).

(2)  Timing issues?  I have not read Myors and I have not refreshed my
memory on the discussion of DMDX timing trials that is in the help pages, so
I'm talking off the top of my head (OK?).  As a scientist, I am responsible
for the integrity of my data.  For example, when recording bioelectric
signals, I calibrate the amplifiers and computer acquisition system.

How can I be assured (and give assurances) that MY DMDX system (hardware) is
performing within MY standards (e.g., the ability to collect responses with
>1 msec resolution/accuracy)?

If I used a photo-detector to detect visual stimuli from the presentation
screen - I could use this to 'trigger' a precision timebase-delay that would
generate a PIO response at a fixed interval (e.g., a response time of
2.50000 seconds).  Wouldn't repeatedly running this 'stimulus - response'
test under a variety of DMDX task 'loads' (e.g., playing audio, scrambling,
looping, slicing, dicing, and pureeing) define the statistical qualities of
DMDX's 'timing integrity'?  If not, why not?

So:  How can I assure myself ... ?

Thanks you,

Derek

I would also like to add more scripts to my tutorial pages.  One of these 
days I will get round to bringing these pages up to date, but I no longer 
have much time to devote to this so it may yet be a while.  However, adding 
sample scripts is an quick and easy task so I will always have time for 
that.  Were someone to make a web page with function calls etc then I could 
link to it from my pages.

   You have to take my word for it or you have to be a sufficiently skilled 
technician or have access to a skilled technician to build test equipment 
of your own design and test it yourself.  What's the difference between me 
telling you how to build test equipment and me telling you that DMDX works?

   That would work, there's even a testmode designed to facilitate testing 
that particular apparatus.  It's one of the tests I have written up in the 
Input section of DMDX's help.

         When I asked for examples of interesting scripts, my aim was to 
collect together a number of scripts and organize them, so that they can be 
made available on a web site.  I think that is better than having scripts 
of various types randomly scattered throughout the DMDX list archive.

         When submitting a script, only include enough items to illustrate 
the main features of the script.  Also, include relevant comments in the 
script.  Below, I have included an example of what I had in mind.  This is 
a fairly elementary script, and contains a lot of detail that would not be 
required for more advanced scripts.

         --k.i.f.

Example of an elementary script.

<n 32> <fd 36> <id keyboard> <cr> <d 20> <s 16> <fbp 0>
$
! Sample script for a semantic priming experiment
using lexical decision.

Parameter Line:

<n 32>  Number of items
<f 36>    The default frame duration is 36 video ticks
<id keyboard> The input device is the keyboard.
<cr>  continuous running. The display automatically continues to the next 
item with a delay specified by the d parameter, stopping only when it 
reaches an instruction.
<s 16>  The scramble block size is 16.
<fbp 0> Feedback to subject of time taken has 0 decimals. Feedback could be 
suppressed by inserting <nfb> on the parameter line.

Layout of items:

There are 32 test items, arranged in groups of 8 with each experimental 
condition represented equally often in each block.  With <s 16> specified, 
the scramble routine will take the first 16 items, scramble their order, 
then the next 16, etc., and then will scramble the order of the blocks.

Presentation details:

Following the fixation point (++), a blank screen is displayed for the 
default frame duration (indicated by a blank frame, i.e., / /). The next 
frame contains the prime, which is displayed for 18 ticks (as indicated by 
%18).  Inserted between the prime and the target is a blank screen lasting 
for 12 ticks. After the target item has been displayed for 36 ticks, a 
blank frame is displayed for 36 ticks. If the target is to remain on the 
screen until the subject makes a response (response contingent erasure), 
then the final blank frame should be omitted (i.e., remove the final frame 
delimiter).

The display font is Courier New 12 point bold.  This can be changed by 
selecting the entire file in Word and choosing a new font.

         The DMDX User notes contain discussions of timing accuracy.  The 
article we are writing will present much the same material.

         Both DMDX and TimeDX have Test modes that enable you to evaluate 
the performance of your system.  These are discussed in the Help files.

         This has been done, and the results are discussed in the User Notes.

"You have to take my word for it"
Personally, I do, really I do.  Professionally, I shouldn't.
Parenthetically, didn't this discussion start with a request by Ken to help
demonstrate the timing precision of DMDX to a skeptical reviewer?  Why
doesn't someone (yous) publish a methods paper and put this Windows timing
'controversy' to bed?

"What's the difference between me telling you how to build test equipment
and me telling you that DMDX works?"
I'll try that one on my step-son when he begins his teenage experimentation
with alcohol and girls :)

Why would I want to validate DMDX's operation on my computer? (I don't
really, I'm much too busy).  I suppose because I can't fully conceptualize
how DMDX timing works and therefore I would want to test it empirically so
it 'feels right'.


Where am I at?  (again, the disclaimer about not having consulted the manual
recently)
i.  uhhh ... my refresh rate is 16 ms and that means the screen is redrawn
62.5 times per second (1/0.016).  I have the feeling that 16ms is the basic
metronome of the (my) system.  If I display a dot and then wait EXACTLY 1000
msec to display another dot, I'm going to 'land' in the middle of a refresh
and have to wait for the next one.  So, the inter-dot display interval has
to be a multiple of 16 ms in order to be correct.

ii.  I don't know if the DMDX frames are advanced in tick increments or if
Windows just tries to accomodate this, if it feels like it.

iii.  I don't understand how the 'microsecond' system clock is polled and
how the DMDX software calls to the clock are affected my Windows' mood.

-- you see a basic muddle.


"That would work, there's even a testmode designed to facilitate testing
that particular apparatus.  It's one of the tests I have written up in the
Input section of DMDX's help."  Beautiful!   I know exactly what to do if
some pest of a reviewer ever challenges me.

Thanks again,

Derek

Dear all,

Wondering if you guys could help me with this one:=20
Is there a way for DMDX to present again those items that were not =
correctly answered first off? That is, in the first stage of the =
experiment, we want to present all the items of the task, then in the =
second stage, only those items that were missed or answered incorrectly =
in the first stage. Can this be done through branching? Not sure how to =
go about it, would really appreciate your help.

Thanks,
Helen

   Branching and counters.  You'll want to set a counter to zero for every 
item, assuming there are unique item numbers then use the item number for 
the counter number.  In the first stage every item should include 
<IncrementIfCorrect>.  In the second stage all the items should be repeated 
but branches should be included around every item if the respective counter 
is greater than 0.  For example:

<set c100 = 0>
<set c101 = 0>
...

+100 "target 100" * <incic 100>;
+101 "target 101" * <incic 101>;
...

~0 <bi 0, c100 .gt. 0>;
+200 "target 100" *;
~0 <bi 0, c101 .gt. 0>;
+201 "target 101" *;
...

Hello all, 

I am trying to code the instructions for a task to stay on the screen for
3 seconds, then the task itself will begin. Presently, the instructions are
coded for 1 tic, but are staying on the screen for 4 seconds, due to the
amount of time it is taking DMDX to load the task. Is there a code  that
can be added to the instructions frame that tells DMDX to leave the graphics
(instruction text)
on the screen until the next frame displays?
Any help would be greatly appreciated!

   Use two items.  First displays the text and leaves it on the 
screen.  Second loads the task.

I've been wrestling with DMDX for many hours now, and know that soon 
I'll be posting dumb questions, and so I thought I'd better introduce 
myself.

I have a Ph.D. in psycholinguistics from the University of Alberta 
(2000) and live in Kazakhstan where I am introducing psycholinguistic 
methods in the General Linguistics Department of the Kazakhstan 
National University in Almaty. I am not totally computer illiterate, 
but by no means a programmer, and have little experience with 
Windows. I considered scraping together the money for a commercial 
program, but realized that that would mean that no students would be 
able to work on developing experiments on their own computers. So I 
opted for DMDX since so many people rave that it is easy to learn. I 
really don't want to be asking terribly dumb questions, though 
believe me, I have a few already!

Question 1:

In one of the on-line manuals I read: "You will need to read the full 
documentation
eventually (unfortunately?)." Where is the full documentation 
available? I haven't found a manual for DMDX on line, nor found 
reference to it (though I found a manual for DMASTR and read it).


For the future of contribution of Kazakhstani psycholinguists,
Greg

Hi.  That's my line and the full documentation is Jonathon's help pages.  I 
wrote my tutorial to help folk here in Cambridge that were having problems 
with the help pages which at that point were less thorough than they are 
now.  Also, they were for folks who found some of the technical aspects of 
the help pages difficult to understand.  By giving explained simple 
examples I wanted to show folk that DMDX is in fact easy to use.  By using 
a combination of my and Matt Davis's manuals and the help pages I think it 
should be possible to learn how to use DMDX competantly.

By the way, are you working in Kazakh or Russian?

It appears that when I present a wav file, an additional tic is added to the
item when I use the syntax below.  Is this a result of a syntax error or
misunderstanding of wav file presentation that can be corrected or do I need
to adjust for this additional tic in the timing of later frames when
presenting wav files (i.e., subtract one tic from next frame)?  Syntax
below.  Wav file is 50ms long.

   I guess seeing as you haven't overridden the duration of the frame with 
the wave file in it it's faintly possible it's coming out to a non-zero 
number so you might try:

218 o22 <graphic>"GREEN" <% 242>/o122 <wav 2>  "wnprobe" <svp
start> %0 /<graphic>"GREEN" <% 120>/o23 <% 483>/;

  Actually what I suspect it is is the rounding up routines that insure 
that the duration of a sound frame in tics is longer than the wave form 
is.  So when it gets a hold of a 0ms duration waveform it nicely rounds 
that up to 1 tic.

Adding the %0 did the trick. All frames now present for the correct number
of tics

Hi

Can anyone help me??
I'm trying to run DMDX on a NEC laptop Versa Note that uses a Piii under 
windows 2000 (using an ATI video card).
I've already used dmdx with a desktop under win2000 without any problem.

My problem is that when I try to check the syntax, nothing happens (really 
nothing) and the application crashes. And when I run the rtf file, dmdx 
switches the display into VGA mode and then crashes.
In my view, it seems that the file .rtf can't be read.

thanks for your responses.

   Well I stuck Windows Me on the test box and it's millisecond callback SD 
dropped from 0.6ms (or higher) down to 0.07ms, a roughly tenfold increase 
in timing accuracy.  So for people using a PIO12 or other polled devices 
for input an Me upgrade from 98 or 98SE is highly recommended.

   The .RTF can probably be read, what is likely to be occurring is that a 
device driver is failing.  You can have a look at DIAGNOSTICS.TXT in 
whatever folder DMDX is in which might give you a better idea of just what 
is failing but it's more than likely the video drivers.  If RTFPARSED.ITM 
is not being written then something much more sinister must be occurring.

Well, until this afternoon I had never experienced this problem with any of our 
Dell PCs or Laptops running Win98 or ME.  However, we had some new Toshiba 
Satellite Pro 4600s (PIII/850, 256MB RAM) that had just arrived with W2K, so we 
thought we'd pop on the most recent version of DMDX (which works just fine on 
our other machines) and see how it fared.  Unfortunately, although I can run 
TimeDX and set/time video modes etc., when I open DMDX, all looks fine except 
that I can't browse the hard disk to select any rtf files to run.  These 
machines were not purchased to be used for testing, so this problem is not dire 
from our perspective, but I'd love to know what causes the problem!

Regards,
Anna W.

This problem with browsing the hard disk, in my experience, only happens 
the very first time you use DMDX after setting things up.  I have often, 
but not always had to type the full path of the an rtf file to get it to 
load.  After that the browsing has always worked.

   Yep, that's the fix.  Seeing as I have a couple of XP boxes now I'll try 
whacking the DMDX registry tree and see if it duplicates the trouble -- 
some win32 function has obviously changed between 9x and w2k and I'll have 
to find out which one...

Dear All,
         Thanks so much for the rapid replies.  I could have sworn that I tried 
to type in the full path yesterday and it wouldn't let me type in anything at 
all, however having started it from a DOS window today, it accepted the full 
path, and will now browse happily.  I also tried to download that new version in 
which this problem is fixed (2.6.05), but I keep ending up with 2.6.04 somehow.

Thanks again,
Anna W.

Thanks very much for checking - I'm obviously doing something wrong (certainly 
wouldn't be the first time!).  Will try again on Monday.

Thanks again,

OK, I just downloaded again and got 2.6.05 - no problem.  Not sure why I was 
getting 2.6.04 on Friday, but I definitely was, as I have zip files that are 
dated 11/1/02 (3:01pm our time) that give me 2.6.04.  Perhaps I was too quick 
off the mark in trying to download 2.6.05.  Unfortunately, I no longer have a 
W2K machine on which to try out the new version (the Toshiba laptops having made 
their way to their rightful owners), but I will be sure to do so when another 
W2K machine crosses my path.

Thanks,
Anna W.

Hi,
it's been a while since I've used DMDX (ahh, the good 
'ol  v.0.29....).  I've got the new paradigm all set up, however would like 
to tidy up the presentation.  Is there any way
to have frames aligned to the left or right, just like in a word processor, 
instead of the frame centered on the line?


Thanks,

Ralf

Hi,

I'm not sure but I  found perhaps a problem with Analyze: for the =
sujbect 1 the rt should be for the following conditions ( with an =
exclusion for the datas above 2 standard deviations):
11    12    13    21    22    23
618   660    636    583    651    563
And they are (in the das file):
618    660    664    607    651    543

It seems that sometimes Analyze don't remove the outliers.
I joined all the files in a zip   =20
The detailed computations are in the excel file

         I've just spent the morning checking out the trim vs exclude 
functions in Analyze, and on my data files, they correspond exactly to what 
we get with Excel.  Or, I should say, to what we get with Excel after 
correcting about five different mistakes that I made in applying formulas, 
etc.  Personally, I think Excel creates unlimited possibilities for errors, 
and you should not operate it without a co-pilot.

         So what is wrong with your file?  I don't know.  The .xls file you 
sent has something weird in it.  I tried trimming the data using a formula 
such as "=IF(B8>$N$5, $N$5,B8)", where B8 is the RT and $N$5 is the upper 
cutoff, but the logical function does not execute correctly -- e.g., it 
says that 758 is not greater than 750, although it does say that 758 is 
greater than 1.

         When I opened your .azk file in a new worksheet, everything seemed 
OK, except that now I couldn't easily determine which items should be analyzed.

         Another possible problem.  I noticed that you calculated the SD 
for each condition separately, suggesting that you were trimming RTs within 
a condition using the condition mean and the condition SD.  I think this 
would be a mistake, since you are artificially reducing the error 
term.  The way Analyze works is to trim on the basis of the overall mean 
and SD for all items specified in the .spc file.

Dear Dmdx users,
I have to present periodic stimuli (a moving  grating) for say 20 sec,
so I'm using  .avi files which are huge in size since they contain
several periods of the moving grating.
Ideally, to reduce the size of the files, I would like to have only one
period in the .avi file and then present the file repetitively in a
loop.
Is it possible to do that currently, and if not, will it be possible in
the future?
Thanks a lot.

    First I used my own softs (in perl) to calculate the means. Then I saw
the difference between it and analyze. So I made the computations with
excel.

        Another possible problem.  I noticed that you calculated the SD for
each condition separately, suggesting that you were trimming RTs within a
condition using the condition mean and the condition SD.  I think this would
be a mistake, since you are artificially reducing the error term.  The way
Analyze works is to trim on the basis of the overall mean and SD for all
items specified in the .spc file.

The difference came from that.
I use the condition mean and condition SD for each item (or subject when the
analyse is by subject) because we could imagine an experiment where
condition A is a lot longer than condition B. In this case a long RT in
condition B could be preserve because of the RTs of condition A.

   You can do it but there will be a discontinuity as the file is closed 
and opened again.  The <Animate> option will reschedule a frame a number of 
times at some future time.

I am frustrated in my attempts to run a simple script without generating

Frame "1a" always times in 6 or 7 ticks late.

The help files advises:

(1) "less stringent timing"
-  I first tried tuning the video display parameters in TimeDX (for a
variety of display modes).  In all attempts to tweak sleep-time,
lines-to-blit, time-out and refreshments -- I can slow down the timouts to
about 5% and eliminate certain errors and multiply timeouts.

(2) Easing the demands on the display,
-  Easing the demands?  Am I making unreasonable or badly formed demands?

(3) Using a video card with more memory.
-  I am using an ATI MACH64 with 8MB.  DirectX version 8.0, 166MHZ MMX
Pentium.


Can anyone offer some suggestions on what to do next?

   Take the <d 20> out of the parameter line.  You are asking DMDX to have 
the item prepared in 20 ticks, no matter what and your P166 just isn't up 
to the task, it is taking 26 or 27 ticks.  The delay parameter is provided 
for situations when the ISI absolutely has to be rigid, if you don't like 
the default delay from request to display use a negative D parameter, in 
your case <d -20>.  This will make DMDX take at least 20 ticks between 
items but if it needs more it will take it and not throw an error.  If you 
want a rigid ISI look at the sum of the longest Preparation A and B times 
and divide them by the refresh rate then add a fudge factor of a couple of 
ticks and use that.

Hello,

Another question from the undergrad lab co-ordinator at UofT.
I'm trying to run the program, but I get the following error message:

   It means your item file is probably missing a frame delimiter (the 
slash) or a text delimiter (the double quote) or an item delimiter (the 
semi-colon).  Look at the last item before this message is displayed and 
scrutinize it.

<d20> was a typo, but it makes little difference <d -20> , <d -30> , or  <d

   Looking at the archive I see you have a <d 0> in there too, _that's_ the

Thank you for noticing my extra <d 0> Jonathon.  Removing the Delay (both of
them helped), but the real source of my problem seems to be that I was using
'low' resosultion video modes like [640 x 480 8 bit] and [600 x 800 8 bit]
in order to 'free up' video buffers.  When I switched to [1024 x 768 16 bit]
resolution, everything worked like a charm without error, on a dual monitor
system even when Windows was playing a Frank Zappa CD in the background.

The help files gave me the hint about this.

Thank you for all your help!

Derek

   Yeah, 8 bit video modes are slower on some hardware.  Counterintuitive, 
I figure it must be to do with windows having to muck with palette colors.

   Correct, you could use counters.  Or you could use conditional branches 
around a statement with an <end> in it.

Hello,

This past summer, a person in the lab ran a dmdx program, and our 
current program is very similar. So similar, we copied her intro. 
However, we are continously told by DMDX that the intro is faulty, 
and its become so bad, that when we load up the file, we instantously 
receive a "this program has performed an illegal operation" message. 
I have spoken to the person who ran the dmdx program in the summer, 
and she says she doesn't know why its not working for us; it did work 
for her. I have copied the intro plus an item file into this e-mail. 
If anyone has any idea why it isn't working, it would be greatly 
appreciated. Thank-you,
Tyler

Dear DMDX users, I would appreciate any help.  Below is the beginning of a
longer file -- the idea is that a string of 5 numbers is flashed and the
subject enters what he/she saw and then presses RETURN to go to the next
item. 
On my office computer the program proceeds to the next item after 8 numbers
are
entered (not waiting for RETURN), and one of my lab computers goes to the next
item after entering 2 numbers.  ANy thoughts?  (As a minor matter, and
probably
irrelevant, the syntax check claims that I have requested the video mode
640x480 which it complains about, although it loads and runs fine apart from
the above problem. And after running, the synax checker is happy)

Thanks for any suggestions!

jeff

   For a start you've got a $ in there and no scrambling.  While I wouldn't 
expect this to crash DMDX I'd certainly expect a syntax error.  Take all 
the $ out or put an S parameter back in and see what happens.

   You're absolutely sure it's the same item file?  I've had people swear 
they had the same item file on three machines and that one of them was 
doing something different and when I go up there, lo and behold, it's a 
different item file.

   About the only thing that I can think of that would cause <zek> to not 
wait for an enter key was setting the <zil> parameter to some number lower 
than the number of keystrokes entered, for instance <zil 4>.  What does the 
data file look like?
    Bear in mind until you specifically validate zillion keys with <vzk> 
zillion is storing every keystroke and it's release.  You might want to 
validate the keys you are interested in.

   I'd take the 'e' switch out, it's only needed if DMDX makes a mistake 
calculating the size of a font and even then the <OverSize> keyword is 
provided to fix that.  E is bad nowadays.

Does anyone know if it's possible to have feedback on one command line without
having feedback on all items? For example, I would not like to give any feedback
on one item but feedback on another. So far, it seems you can just either
give feedback on all items or no feedback on all items. Below is an example
of my script; I do not want feedback on the +1 line, but do want feedback
on the +2 line. Is that possible to do?

   Yes, all the feedback keywords are both parameters and switches meaning 
they can be used in parameter lines and items.  Just turn the feedback on 
the items you ant it on with <nfb 0> and off again in the others with <nfb>.

Hi
I am trying to code a program that will display text instructions and a little
dot. The program is not displaying the text after "Scan 1" or the little
dot even though no syntax errors are reported. Also, I do not want to include
the clock command, which seems to cause problems when I try to add an item
number.
Here is part of the code:

<rcot> <zil> <cr> <fd 0> <t 0> <d 0> <vm 640,480,480,16,0> <id keyboard>
<nfb> <dbc 000 000  000> <cfbo 1> <dfd 1>  <df Times New Roman> <dfs 26>


 0 "Experiment Ready" ;
 0   "Scan 1"%900/;
  "Now FOCUS on the Target" %179/;
 0x313  "&#131;" %1797/!c;
 " Now Follow the Target "%179/;
 0x313 "&#131;"/;
  x315 "&#131;"/;
I am sure the solution is quite easy, I just cannot seem to figure it out,
so any help would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks, Lindsey

   You're missing item numbers, odd that the syntax checker didn't freak 
out.  You need a 0 at the start of this line:

Hi
Thanks for all you responses. When a 0 is added in front of the line, as
an item number, the text will not display unless the spacebar is pressed.
Any suggestions?
Thanks again, Lindsey

Greetings.

I'm a PhD student at the University of New England and I wish to use DMDX 
to play some wav files while recording ERPs (write to pins of the parallel 
port). I'd really appreciate it if someone could send me a script that I 
can modify to my requirements.

The base requirements are:
Begin process
         Sound A.WAV (say 10 times)
         write to external device (SET pin 1, say)
         Sound B.WAV
         write to external device (RESET pin 1, say)
         wait for 1000ms
End process

Your assistance is much appreciated.
regards,
Keith J. Majoos

PS. I've used DMDX in the past for a mask priming experiment and is 
familiar with the structure, I'm just a bit unclear when it comes to 
writing to PIO.

   You can't, DMDX doesn't support writing to the parallel port, you will 
have to buy an interface card.  If you have an ISA slot free you'll want 
one of these:

   If not and you only have PCI slots then one of these:

   You'll want to read the TimeDX docs on the PIO and set the base address 
of the card.  You'll want to use <id PIO12> in the parameter line of your 
item files and <0 N> to write word N to the card.  If you want the I/O 
lines to automatically reset then use <RevertOutput>.  All of those 
keywords are explained in the help file.

Dear all,

We've a question again that we hope you can help us with. In a new =
experiment, we're planning to present a sentence to the subject where =
the task is to detect a particular phoneme in the sentence. For example, =
the subject might be asked to press yes as soon as the phoneme "s" is =
detected in the auditorily-presented sentence "the cat sat on a mat". =
The tricky bit is that we want to give the subject feedback if they're =
responding too early. So, if they respond "yes" before "sat", or if they =
respond "no" at any point during the sentence, we would like to give =
them the feedback "you're responding too early", and then the next item =
will be presented. And if they respond yes after "sat", the feedback =
would be "correct" and they'll move on to the next item.=20
We want to record the reaction time as well. We'd prefer not to chop a =
sentence up into separate words (and therefore separate wav files) =
because sometimes the critical phoneme is in the middle of a word. Our =
idea is that we'd need to use some sort of timer on DMDX, and that the =
feedback will be different depending on when the response is given =
during the sentence. But we're not sure how this could be done on DMDX, =
please help.=20

Specifically, does anyone know whether you can specify when clockon =
starts in ticks or milliseconds?

   No, you'll just have to start the clock early and then subtract that 
from the RT for analysis.  You'll want to turn normal feedback off with 
<nfb> use counters and a custom feedback routine called every item as per 
the example in the <Branch> help.  You'll want to load a counter with the

Question:  The <Revert Output> (or <RO>) keyword only functions in the
parameter line at the beginning of the DMDX item file.

If <RO> is set up like this:

      <REM PARAMETER LINE>  <RO 10 , 0>  <REM setup 10 msec 'pulse' from PIO
output>

Is there any way to overide <RO> and write outputs to the PIO port with
other durations?

I don't suppose that <RO> and <OX> (output hex word) are independent of one
another
so that one could do something like this:

<1> <ms % 100> <OX 1> / <OX 0>    <REM put hex 1 to PIO port for 100 msec
and then revert to 0> / ;
<2> <O 256>    <REM put decimal 256 to PIO port for 10 msec, as specified in
RevertOutput parameter> / ;


Thank you

Inserting the scrambling parameter and removing the "$"s, the program

When I first installed DMDX in our lab at KazNU, the demo experiments 
which play sound files worked fine. Recently the sounds started 
playing extremely faintly when played from within DMDX, although the 
same sound files still play just fine, just as always, from within 
TimeDX. Between the time that the sound files played normally from 
within DMDX and they time that they started playing faintly the 
Computer Services Department here at KazNU added a microphone to the 
computer. Perhaps some system-level software that they installed or 
altered interacts badly with DMDX (but not with TimeDX). Has anyone 
had a similar problem and found a solution? (We will soon be 
developing an auditory sentence-picture verification experiment, and 
so this is a roadblock until we find a solution.)

   Usually anything's that's screwed up for DMDX should be screwed up for 
TimeDX as there's very little difference between the two programs as far as 
the way they do things.  DMDX has the ability to attenuate files it plays 
that TimeDX doesn't expose, maybe someone added a <vol> keywords to your 
item files.  But check all the volume controls anyway and check the 
recording controls too that are cunningly hidden.

In our current program, items have a time dealine of <t 8000>, and 
this is exactly what was occuring. However, for some reason, our 
program stopped doing this timed function. The only change made was 
changing the <s> parameter from <s 16> to <s 128>; <n> is <n 128>.

I will post the header line, the intro, and 12 sample items. Does 
anyone know why the program has ceased to have a deadline on the 
items? I am very confused because everything was working fine this 
morning.

   Your scrambling is going berserk and the <t 60000> items are now in 
places they shouldn't be.  Use <s 1> instead of <s 128>.

I am trying to run a program using scrambling. If I use the program I have
attached below it gives me a "missing-$" error at syntax check. If I take
out the second $ it will include the first line in the scramble. I do not
want the first line to be scrambled. What is the proper way of using the
$?
Thanks

Jonathan, any chance the <recordvocal> device could be set item-by-item
instead of for the whole file?  I've got a set of item files that include
several different tasks using a button box and then one task (at the end)
that uses naming.  I only want to record vocal responses for the last set of
clockon items.  Any way to do this?

         Well, when I run this file I don't get that error message.  DMDX 
gets upset at <id ?keyboard?>.  Where have these question marks come from?

         The scramble error msg most likely indicates that there is another 
$ somewhere in your file.

         Assuming that Jonathan doesn't feel like rewriting the code to 
permit this, the best solution is to have separate .rtf files.  If it is 
too tedious to run three separate files (keeping in mind that you'd need to 
use subject IDs to make sure everything gets linked up correctly 
afterwards), you can write a DOS batch file that runs DMDX with separate 
.rtf files.

   No, I won't be rewriting that anytime soon.  It's one of the last (if 
not the last) fixed rigid thing and changing it isn't really on the 
horizon, it's scope for breaking things is legion.  The closest I came to 
addressing it was allowing one item file to chain another, but even that 
ran into nasty trouble.

   Another way to chain item files occurred to me in the shower this 
morning (slept through morning meditation where these ideas would normally 
occur) so a solution to Matthew's problem not involving batch files may be 
forthcoming in relatively short order.

If there's a way to do this without:

a) DMDX sending the equivalent of o255 when it changes between item
files,
b) DMDX switching in and out of DirectX (or whatever it does that makes
the monitor click when I use batch files to run DMDX item files in
series),

I would be eternally grateful, as these issues have plagued an
experiment I've got in the works, which requires me to use the two high
output pins of a PIO12 card to control two lights, the middle five pins
to trigger Neuroscan, and the low pin to trigger a shock box (which is
not yet implemented, but may be nice to have).  When my batch file
switches between item files, it briefly sets all pins high and hence
turns on both lights (and could potentially give a hapless subject a
mini-shock).  It also does some toggling between DirectX and normal
display, which makes the monitor click audibly and annoyingly, and

   Unfortunately for you you (or your technician) have/has chosen to use 
positive logic to control your devices, however computers in general are 
built around negative logic where a high signal is an inactive signal.  I 
seriously recommend changing the logic in your hardware as these issues are 
going to plague to as long as you continue to use positive logic.

   A point I should clarify, if you used negative logic you would never get 
a spurious trigger of any of your devices.  I'm not being pedantic and 
refusing to change DMDX's behavior, this is hardwired behavior of the 
interface card.  Specifically before it has been setup all the I/O lines 
are in a high impedance state, typically interpreted by logic devices as a 
high signal.  I cannot change this behavior, you however can change the 
behavior of the electronics connecting to the interface card.

   2.7.00 introduces the <chain> keyword:

Chain Keyword

<Chain text>

     Parameter and switch to chain another item file. text is interpreted 
to be an itemfile in the same directory as the current itemfile, if no 
extension is provided .rtf is appended to the name. If another directory is 
desired a path relative the current itemfile's path must be used.

     The new item file will not be executed until the current item file 
finishes or terminates with the <Last Frame> keyword. All devices are 
closed and the new item file is run as if it had been run manually thus 
allowing changes in input devices and display resolution.

   Slight oops there, the subject ID was of course cleared at the end of 
the first item file.  Fixed that with 2.7.01 so that when chaining item 
files they all have the same subject ID.

   Which brings up a minor point that subject numbers in .AZK files will 
still increment, so that if you chain from one file to the next the subject 
number won't necessarily be the same and if you then chained back to the 
original item file that subject would now have two subject entries -- I 
won't be trying to address that however.

"When my batch file switches between item files, it briefly sets all pins
high and hence
turns on both lights"

I fell into this trap too, and I agree with JCF that maintaining logical
continuity (i.e., active-low) is the best way to go.  You can easily modify
your shock triggering hardware to active-low triggering by inverting the PIO
output with an 'inverter' logic chip.

But, I already built my experiment control circuitry based on active-high
logic, and am too lazy, busy, and stubborn to change it, so I kludged on a
one-shot pulse generator that clamps the logic lines 'low' for ten seconds
during the DMDX batch file changeovers.

Hello,

[Disclaimer]  I am shamelessly 'thinking out loud' here before I have even
started to experiment with this in hopes that
someone will point out potential problems or make suggestions.


I want to present an audio, visual or PIO output triggered stimulus at a
fixed interval after a PIO input trigger.  To be
specific, the stimulus is given 200 msec after each heart beat (logic pulse
from R-wave detector).

     <InputDevice PIO> <REM   Not Continuous running!>

     ^1 * <timeout 4000> <REM wait at least 4 seconds for heart beat> / <O
1> <REM when response is detected, previous frame
         immediately ends and the PIO output is generated> ;

     ^2 <REM same as 1 above ... etc ...>


Question:  Would it be stupid to generate the 200msec delay after the R-wave
trigger in DMDX by inserting a "/ <ms% 200> /" blank frame between the
trigger detection and the output frame?  I am never sure how much slop there
is in the timing.


Thanks,

Derek

   There is exactly as much slop as there is duration in your refresh 
interval.  I recently setup a similar experiment here but I used the 
request signal as the R-spike generated trigger from a BIOPAC, the only 
consideration being that one has to install the PIO12 overriding the 
default request polling interval of 10ms with <id pio12 1,1>.  Then you 
stick a D in the parameter line with whatever number of ticks adds up to 
200ms and items become:

1  "stimuli" / c;

That is not the line I was referring to.

<n 128> <s 1> <d 0>  <id keyboard>, <nfb> <cr> <mnr "+f"> <mpr "+j"> 
<vg 1> <clfb> <t 8000>

$

(large intro segment)

This is the final line in the intro.

0 <ln -5> "Before reading the experiment sentences", <ln -4> "you 
will receive some practice items.", <ln -3> "When the practice items 
are finished,", <ln -2> "the experiment will begin.", <ln -1> "To 
begin the practice items, press the SPACE BAR.", <ln 7> "PRESS THE 
SPACE BAR TO CONTINUE.";

Pressing the space bar here does make the program move on to the 
practice items.


This is the final practice item, all other practice items are 
identical to this item (other than the text)

+148 <t 8000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> c* "One afternoon in class";
+148 c* "Jonathon whispered to Brianne";
+148 c* "while";
+148 <fd 13> " "  / c* "taking notes.";
+148 <umpr> <mpr "+j"> *"Jonathon was taking notes?";
+148 <t 600000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> c* "*NEXT*";

This is the line where we are confused.

In the final line of the intro, pressing the space bar commeneded the 
presentation of the practice items. We assumed that the following 
line is virtually identical to the final line in the intro, 
therefore, we assumed that the experimental items would begin once a 
subject press the space bar after reading the following line:

0 <ln 1> "End of practice items, press the SPACE BAR to begin the 
experimental items.";

Howeer, this does not occur. The line remains on the screen, and no 
keyboard response can remove it.

After the previous line is another dollar sign.
$

And then the experimental items begin, the following is the first 
experimental item.
+1 <t 8000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> c *"One day at the mall";
+1 c *"Michael was stopped by Hannah";
+1 c *"while"; 
+1 <fd 13> " " / c *"leaving the store.";
-1 <umpr> <mpr "+j"> *"Hannah was leaving the store?";
+1 <t 600000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> c* "*NEXT

Therefore, our problem is that the program is not moving from the 
practice items to the experimental items in the manner we had hoped. 
It would be greatly appreciated if you could explain the problem and 
suggest a solution.

Thank-you

WOW!

So, it is this simple?

<InputDevice pio12 1,1> <REM poll request at 1ms intervals> <Delay 10>
<delay next item by 200 msec using my 20msec K-Mart computer video refresh
rate:  200msec / 20msec = 10 ticks>

<REM now we present WAV stimuli 200msec after the PIO request (EKG trigger)>
1 <wav> "stimuli.wav" / Continue;
2 <wav> "stimuli.wav" / Continue;
3 <wav> "stimuli.wav" / Continue;


Amazing!

Thank you JCF!

   Bear in mind that those items are still synchronized with the raster 
giving you 0 to 20ms of variability -- this is unavoidable using DMDX.

   This is the line I was referring to.  At this point in the item file the 
space bar is mapped to the positive response and you have unmapped all 
request keys.  There is no way for an instruction to terminate.

If one is not using the video display in an experiment, can you set the
raster clock at some impractically fast rate like 5ms? in order to minimize
the timing variability (slop) of audio or PIO driven events?

   I've thought about it before but the thing's going to be going berserk 
trying to resync the display every 64 times it times out not finding the 
retrace and while it's trying to resync with the display not much else is 
going to be happening.  You could try it but I sure don't recommend it and 
if you do try it you'll have to some up with some external means of testing 
DMDX's performance.

Hello, 
Any help with the following problem would be greatly appreciated.
The tasks are written and timed for a monitor refresh rate of 75 Hz. however,
periodically the computer will 
change the refresh rate on us and go back to 60 Hz... how can we prevent

this from happening?
Thank-you, 
Lindsey Littrell

<html>
Dear list members,<br><br>
I've written a basic speeded sequential priming task in which
participants are encouraged to respond within 500 ms of target
presentation.&nbsp; To indicate whether the participant responded fast
enough, the reaction time of each item is compared to the value
&quot;500&quot; in a subroutine initiated by a &lt;call&gt; switch at the
end of each item.&nbsp; <br><br>
This program works well with a small number of items (~50 or less).&nbsp;
But as items are added, a noticeable delay begins to occur during the
&lt;call&gt; function.&nbsp; At 288 trials (the number used in my
experiment), the delay during the &lt;call&gt; lasts a few seconds.&nbsp;
The delay appears to grow in a linear fashion with the number of
items.&nbsp; Moreover, I have the program set up so that the trial should
advance as soon as a response is made.&nbsp; Because the delay seems to
occur during the &lt;call&gt; function, the mask is left on the screen
for a few seconds after a response is made, giving the appearance (to the
participant) that the program isn't being immediately receptive to one's
response.<br><br>
For testing purposes, I added labels to the sample below that signal the
onset of each component of the subroutine.&nbsp; Whereas a delay will not
be noticed with a few items (e.g., 10), it will be quite noticeable with
about 300.&nbsp; Note that the delay occurs before the beginning of the
subroutine (line 500).<br><br>
So, does anyone know what causes this delay and how it may be
eliminated?&nbsp; I'd very much appreciate any help with this
one.<br><br>
Thanks,<br><br>
Dave<br><br>

   If you're talking about the machine with the ATI Radeon 7500 in it over 
in  the MRI equipment room every time you boot it make sure the TV display 
is enabled.  That's why the ATI desktop program is left on the screen every 
time it boots -- or if someone turned it off that's why it needs to be 
turned back on.

   Otherwise you need to get into some very low level shenanigans.  You 
basically have to craft a .INF description of the monitor that persuades 
windows that it doesn't run at anything faster than 60Hz.  The best (and 
only) tool I have found for this is a program called PowerStrip.

   Actually thinking about it the Matrox G400 I have allows you to cap the 
refresh rate of a given monitor, but these are generic PnP monitors, it 
might not allow such overriding with unique monitors that windows 
recognizes.  And then there's windows XP with NVIDIA display adapters, 
there's a utility called the Nvidia Refresh Rate Fix that will allow you to 
cap the refresh rate, but that is only with NVIDIA hardware under XP.

Hello,

I built a protocol which aim is to present video stimuli of 3sec in an
fMRI. The problemis that the timing seems to be wrong. Indeed, the .zil
file look like this :

!  Played 75 frames of 75 in RDdeDEPJ1.avi
Item 1, COT 0.00
 100.85,+Bit0 102.83,-Bit0 2062.66,+Button 0 2318.10,-Button 0
!  Played 75 frames of 75 in RDdeDENJ2.avi
Item 2, COT 3875.23
 1660.89,+Button 1 1890.69,-Button 1
!  Played 75 frames of 75 in RDdeGENV4.avi
Item 3, COT 7739.35

As I have a one sec gap between the presentation of two stimuli
(movies), the second COT should be 4000 instead of 3875.23. Same for the
following. Does someone know from where it comes from ?

Thanks a lot ,

  Bruno.

Hi
I have another problem I was hoping to get help solving. The following program
is written to display a dot that moves on the screen. Does anyone have any
suggestions for making the dot move more quickly. Each display of the dot
is written to be one item, which is the only way I have been able to get
the dot to display and move at all. If there is a better way to do this,
I would love to know.
Thank you, 
Lindsey

   <fd 0> is certain to cause DMDX to have an aneurysm, you've told it that 
the default fame duration is 0 tics, don't ever display anything.  But of 
course you override it with <dfd> later so it doesn't actually matter.

   And <t 0> is going to blow it up as well, fortunately you override that 
as well (although why you should be playing with the subject response 
timeout is a mystery when you aren't collecting responses).

   I doubt very much that the monitor is at 60Hz, the refresh interval 
would be 16.66ms.  Your value of 13.89 indicates 72Hz.  Also, before I 
start punching numbers into the calculator you'd better check that the 
frame duration of your video is 33.33ms (you get that at the end of 
TimeDX's Advanced Tests / Digital Video Test).

I apologize, the monitor is indeed at 72 Hz.

I can't test the frame duration right now as i am not in front of the right
computer (at the fMRI center). I'll be able to tell you tomorrow (it's getting
dark here).
Thanks a lot for your help so far.

   Well, given your current item file structure and the info we have to 
date and assuming your digital video's frame rate is in fact 30Hz the 
duration of one of your items is going to be:

-1*<dv>"RDdeDEPJ1"              75 x 33.33ms  = 2499.75ms
/<% 41>                 41 x 13.89ms  = 569.49ms
/;                              1 x  13.89ms  = 13.89ms
                                 30 x 13.89ms  = 416.70ms
                                               = 3499.83ms

   Which leaves 370ms unaccounted for.  However, you've got digital video 
in there and there is a Run Transition Time (displayed by the TimeDX 
Digital Video Test) and this is added to the duration of a digital video 
frame.  On my 850MHz Athlon a typical value is 160ms and it's likely to 
scale with processor speed so if your machine is much slower your value for 
the Run Transition Time is likely to be much larger.  And then there's the 
indeterminate amount of time added when the digital video ends as the 
digital video's frame duration is never going to be the monitor's refresh 
rate, but that's not likely to be more than a frame or two.

   Basically you can see that you're not likely to be able to get a 
constant ISI as long as you are using the digital video's playing duration, 
or if you do, it's by fudging things and assuming that the Run Transition 
Time and the cleanup afterwards is going to be constant -- which would be 
wrong because once the digital video file has been referenced once it's 
likely to be in the hard disk cache, the next time I bench the same file in 
TimeDX the Run Transition Time is under 60ms.  I would change your item 
structure to something like the following:

-1 %210 * <dv> "RDdeDEPJ1" / %41 /;

   I pick 210 because that gives 2870ms to play the video, a larger figure 
might be needed.   Assuming this in fact legal to do, I might be wrong, 
it's been years since I wrote that code and it might just flat out not be 
possible to specify a digital video's frame duration -- indeed the 
documentation 
(http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhdigitalvideo.htm) 
mentions rescheduling frames to compensate for Run Transition Time so you 
might be SOL.  You'll have to try it and see if you get a constant COT 
delta, you might want to try a stupidly large value (say 400 ticks) for the 
digital video frame's duration just to see if you can in fact get a 
constant COT delta.

One thing that has been an issue for us using our DMDX programs in the 
scanner is that our scanner presentation system translates the signal from 
the computer into video signal.  If that's the case, then the refresh rate 
is determined by the video signal, not by whatever you set on your computer 
monitor, and I'm pretty sure it has to be 60 hz.  So if you're setting your 
refresh rate at 75 hz, even if you get your program to run to the exact 
timing that you want, when you go to the magnet the timing will be messed 
up again because of the translation to video output.  Might be the case for 
some of the users that have been having trouble lately.

Hello,

I finally managed to get a stable COT when playing digital video files 
by adding a <dv% 75> in the beginning of each item line. Where 75 is the 
frame number corresponding to the last frame of the movie to be played.
Thanks for the helpful advices.

Bruno.

Hi Jonathon,
Sorry to bother you about timing issues, but I want to make sure that I
correctly understand the timing of my DMDX script and the scanner
trigger that you designed for our lab.  Below is the parameter line and
a couple lines of my script, along w/ a couple lines of the output
file.  The delay of 90 tics =1.5 seconds.  I'm guessing that the scanner
is triggered after the <o 254>/, and thus the second  "READY" and the
start of the scanner are occurring simultaneously.  That second "READY"
remains on the screen for 12.5 seconds, then the delay of 1.5 seconds,
and then the cue "WHICH OBJECT DID YOU SEE?" is on the screen for 2
seconds, then a delay of 1.5 seconds, and then my jpges appear and I get
my first COT (COT=0), which is really 17.5 seconds after the scanner
started. Is this correct?

Thanks,
Scott

   Only roughly.  There are many stray frames in there and you never 
specify the default duration of a frame, no F or <dfd> parameter (only use 
one, they're synonyms).

   So the duration of the <o 254> frame is likely to be zero ticks but 
might just as well be something else, I've never tested an item file 
without a default frame duration.

>/"READY"<ms% 12500>/;

   Besides the fact that <ms% 12500> is only a rough descriptor of the 
frame's duration the /; takes another tick too.  The ms% is rough in that 
it specifies "display the frame for as many ticks as needed to make sure 
the frame is up for at least 12.5 seconds" -- given the nature of floating 
point arithmetic this frame is almost guaranteed to be displayed for 
another frame.

>+2001<ln -1>"WHICH OBJECT",<ln 1>"DID YOU SEE?"<ms% 2000>

   Probably another tick in here too.

   My guess would be that the initial COT is 17.566 seconds after the 
scanner triggered.

   I take it from your item file design you don't want a constant ISI?

Hi,

I wonder whether anyone can give me some advice.  I am currently running
an experiment where on half of the trials the response is a free 
report, they just type in whatever word they think they saw.  Then 
every other trial is a forced choice between 2 items.  The items are 
paired so they always appear together but in a random order.

I am trying to get the response on the forced choice to be coded as 
correct or incorrect so I only have to manually code half the items in 
the data file as correct or incorrect.  The zillion response works fine 
but I cannot figure out how to have standard responses with the shift 
keys on the forced choice trials.

I have included a small sample from my current data file.

Thanks for any suggestion offered.

Emma

Hi Emma,

I've come across a similar problem, and ended up having to bite the bullet 
and do the 'correct/incorrect' coding off-line. However, I now think it may 
be possible to get round this with some mode-switching in the two trials.

Try adding a switch for <ZillionTypedResponses> (<ztr>) into the typed 
response items and <ZillionOneResponses> (<zor>) into the 2-afc items. For 
the lines that use <zor> you may also need to specify correct and incorrect 
response (using <MapPositiveResponse> and <MapNegativeResponse> - see the 
<zor> help page).

I'm interested to hear if this works - let me know how you get on.

Cheers,

Matt

   Yeah, you'll have to be swapping modes all the time, but hey, item files 
aren't limited any more and if you really don't like the extra bulk you 
could use macros.  Any way, while <zil> is not something that can be turned 
off <zek> and <zor> can be turned off.  You're also going to want to 
validate (<vzk>) and invalidate (<izk>) zillion keys too, that's really 
going to bulk things out.

   So items that want one of two shift keys will have to have something 
like the following in them:

<zek 0> <izk> <zor 1> <vzk +left shift> <vzk +right shift>

   Free association items will need:

<zor 0> <izk> <zek 1> <vzk +a> <vzk +b> and so on though the alphabet... 
<vzk +enter>

   If the DMDX doesn't wind up wiping out the default positive and negative 
key mappings you probably don't need to be using <mnr +left shift> <mpr 
+right shift>, or at worst my guess is that they only need to be included 
once at the beginning.

   Using macros you could have this once at the beginning

ma#<zek 0> <izk> <zor 1> <vzk +left shift> <vzk +right shift>#
mb#<zor 0> <izk> <zek 1> <vzk +a> <vzk +b> etc <vzk +enter>#

   And then the two item types could collapse to the following:

+001 ~b %100 "+"/%3"#####"/ %2"acres"/%3"#####"/* "?";
+002 ~a * %0 "acres"/!y250 "cares";

It is against the grain of modern education to teach children to

organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be

Thanks Jonathon.

In case you were wondering, this particular study is an "event-related
design", as opposed to the block design in which a constant ISI is
imperative.  With event related studies, it's actually preferred that the
stimulus onset times be "jittered" to reduce unwanted task related
correlations that can occur w/ a constant ISI (e.g., heart rate).  With this
design, the critical piece of information is knowing exactly when the stimuli
appeared so you can look at the hemodynamic response in the brain at that
point in time.

Thanks for the macro suggestion, I am having a few problems getting it 
to work.  Do I include it in the first line?
When I do this and try to run it I get an error message that it doesn't
recognise the character ~ and that there is a missing clock on item....

Any ideas?
Thanks 
Emma

   It's not a parameter, it must occur in the body of the item file, ie, in 
an item.

I'm running a recognition memory task: subjects are presented with a list
of items, in the form of a picture with a set of associated labels, there
is an interpolated task (simple math verification problems), a set of
recall cues are presented, then the set of recognition test items are
shown. Everything seems to be working fine, with the exception that the
AZK file is not logging RTs. Responses are logged as either -1 or 1. 

A set of lines from the script are below. Items coded as 99 are study
items (not requiring a response), items coded as 99 are math verification
problems, and items coded as 97 are cues provided in advance of the
recognition test.

Is there any way that get a subjects' responses output to the screen?  I 
want the subject to see a number, e.g. 492, then to respond by typing this 
in.  It would be great for me if either this number could be appear as they 
type or be displayed as feedback so they can possibly change their mind and 
type in another number.  Reading the <zor> keyword documentation it seems 
as if I could do this for single digit numbers but not for strings of >1 digit.

Can anyone help me?

   Yeah, there's a whole new bunch of code tossed in a few months ago that 
does exactly that.  Seeing as I can't recall the keyword maybe it was more 
like a year ago...  Ah, there it is, <AppendCounter>, no wonder I couldn't 
find it, it isn't a feedback keyword at all:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhappendcounterkeyword.htm

   You'll have to have your own custom feedback routine and modify the 
example slightly and load the counter with LastRT or LastXT instead of 
ErrorRate.  And it was added last November so I guess that is a few months 
ago, how fast my memory fades...

Hi there,

I am trying to run an experiment that involves sending a 50 msec 
trigger signal out the PIO port followed (100 msec after trigger 
onset) by the presentation of a 20 msec (boopbs.wav) or 100 
msec (e.g. new37a.wav) audio files. This should then be 
followed 300 msec later by a number or a .bmp appearing on 
the screen and RT is collected at this point. The control file at 
end of message illustrates the principle.

I am experiencing problems with timing using DMDX. In 
screenshot refresh.bmp I have pasted the results from Time DX 
refresh rate and Video Mode tests. These give conflicting values 
of 16.56 and 6.94 msec. DMDX behaves as if the refresh rate is 
6.94 (approximately). So I am not sure how one should interpret 
these results.

The trigger pulse and audio output are illustrated in boopbs.bmp 
In the case of playing the boopbs.wav file the trigger pulse is 
indeed 50 msec long but the wav file is starting at around 80 
rather than 100 msec after trigger onset and there is some 5-8 
msec jitter in the timing of the start of the .wav file. The duration 
of the .wav playback is, however, correct. In the case of the 
new37a.wav file the sound is kicking in about 10 msec into the 
50 msec trigger pulse though the duration of the .wav file is 
correct. This pattern is consistent throughout the 360 trials of the 
expt. with some 40 odd different newxxx.wav files.

I have not explored the timing of the visual stimuli yet as I need 
to locate a device for detecting the luminance changes from the 
monitor.

I would be grateful for any help on these timing questions.

Many Thanks 

Dr Doug Potter

   Just a note to everyone else, kindly do NOT send attachments to the

   I suggest you read the help files for TimeDX's video test completely, 
I've got pages of suggestions in there.  The correct value is very likely 
to be 16.56ms, it is having trouble with your video card for any one of a 
number of reasons, all outlined in TimeDX's help.

   Audio drivers and cards are notorious for these kinds of inaccuracies, 
at least the 5-8ms jitter, the other constant error is due to you having 
the wrong retrace interval duration in TimeDX's Advanced Video Mode 
Test.  TimeDX also has extensive tests to ascertain the accuracy of any 
given sound card.  Get later drivers and if that doesn't fix it you might 
try a later OS like Windows ME.  It's that or buy a later generation sound 
card and or a much faster computer.  John Kline has several recommendations 
in the archives.

Dear experts,

3 questions:

1.)  For an auditory experiment, after the instruction "press spacebar to
start", I would like the screen to have a scale up during the entire
experiment.  The scale looks like "1=identical; 2=similar; 3=quite
different; 4=entirely different".  How should I add this to the rtf. in
order for this scale to be present on the screen the entire experiment?
(the experiment is purely auditory and doesn't have a break)

2.)  For the same experiment, we would like to have the bell ringing
before each stimulus.  We tried putting <Bell> after the number, and
before the stimulus, but only the first stimulus was presented after the
bell, while the others didn't have any bell sounds.  I am wondering
whether we are doing the wrong thing.

3.)  Same experiment, we would like the subjects to respond after each
stimulus by pressing 1, 2, 3, or 4, (i.e. ranks from the scale) and be
able to record their responses.  I am wondering if this can be done at
all.

I understand that my questions might be very stupid, but it would be great
if I can receive some help.

Sincerely,
Cheryl Leung

Assuming that all you're doing is presenting auditory stimuli with no
visual stimuli besides your scale whatsoever, simply put an ! in each FRAME
of your experiment; this will keep the display from refreshing between
frames.  You can also use the <ne> or <NoErase> keywords in place of the !
(not to be confused with <!>, which now serves as a comment indicator). 
For example,

1    @-2 "             My scale",@0"  1       2        3         4         
5 ",@1"  High                                   Low"/ <wav 2> "stuff" !
%50/ <wav 2> "and" ! %100/ <wav 2> "things" ! %75/;

should play the .wav files stuff, and, things sequentially, all the while
keeping the text on screen.

Bugger if I know; I've not used the bell before:)  For the minimal sound
presentation needs I've had, I've always just used .wav files.

Make some macros at the beginning of the experiment that define each of the
correct responses.  Each frame in this item defines a different macro.  I
made a total of 9 macros that allow each of the number keys 1-9 to be
mapped as the correct response, with every other number key being mapped as
an incorrect response.  There's also another macro at the very end that
treats only the Enter key as a response, used for when I want the subject
to be able to toggle through instruction screens and the like.

1    m1= <cfb Correct!  Time:> <umpr><umnr><mpr +1><mnr +2><mnr +3><mnr

Hardly; it took me two days to debug a problem I was having with DMDX
ignoring certain delay statements but not others.  At first, I thought it
might be a buggy implementation of !, but it turned out that it was me
simply forgetting to put a frame-ending / before the item-ending ;.  So
embarrassing, yet thankfully easy to fix.

   <Bell> is not considered a stimulus but a signal to the experimenter, 
only one can occur per item and it's timing is not synchronized with the

I am trying to debug some unwanted PIO-12 behavior.

When DMDX starts a script with <InputDevice PIO12> in the parameter line, the PIO outputs go 'low' momentarily.  This is causing the unwanted triggering of an external device.

Is this a neccesary condition (that I have to learn to live with?)

   Hmm, I guess I've never stuck edge triggered devices on the outputs so 
I've never noticed -- although ISTR a skinner box I built years ago 
exhibiting the same behvior.  Well, there's not a lot of choice, DMDX 
initializes the device and then 1 or 2 milliseconds later writes 0xff to 
the output ports, it has to wait that long because otherwise the 8255 can 
latch up (it's a _really_ old piece of silicon, dates back to 8080 days) 
and it would appear that the initial state of the 8255 is to drive the 
lines low.  So the lines go from their high impedance state which looks 
like a high signal to a momentary low as the device starts driving it's 
outputs and then to actively driven high as DMDX sets their rest state.  I 
can't think of a solution other than to have a disable switch on the 
triggered device and to not enable it till the script is running.

As a followup to my post yesterday about the undesirable behavior of PIO during DMDX startup ... here's the deal:

I am using a post 1996 CMOS 82C55 Keithley PIO-12.  Unlike the earlier PIO-12's, the I/O ports are pulled HIGH (+5 V) when the board is powered on.  When the board is initialized, set I/O ports are set in their desired state (still HIGH in the case of DMDX).  

As I noted yesterday, starting DMDX causes all the output port bits to momentarily go LOW (to ground).  If one of the PIO output bits is designed to trigger a shock generator (when the PIO bit goes LOW), then the subject gets a shock whenever DMDX is started.  

One possible work-around is to prevent the 'trigger bit' from acting is any of the other output bits are simultaneously LOW.  This can be implemented in a simple logic circuit using one inverter and one OR gate (using 3 NOR gates of a 4001 quad NOR gate)  

Let's say that the shock generator is triggered from PIO output bit 7 and we determine the state of the other bits on initialization from bit 1.  Here is the truth table of what we want: 


bit-7   bit-1    Output  (trigger signal to shock generator, L = shock)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
L	H     |	 L   (LOW state triggers a shock)
L	L     |	 H   (HIGH = off, Output will be high unless		      
H	L     |	 H    only bit 7 is LOW)
H	H     |	 H


Circuit:  Invert bit 1 and OR it with bit 7

   I'm surprised you don't get a brief (like a couple of nanoseconds) pulse 
out of that circuit.  The output of the inverter on bit 1 will still be low 
when bit 7 goes low for however long it takes the signal to propagate 
through the inverter.  But I guess you can easily avoid that buy running 
bit 7 through a pair of inverters to delay it.

Hi, I am currently trying to use digital videos in DMDX. I 
have downloaded the Video Demo from 
"http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/" and have 
got it to work properly on my machine. The videos that I am 
using do not prove as fruitful...

They are also .avi files, so I simply altered the code from 
the demo from "explode" to "green" (the name of my file). 
However, when it comes to loading my file DMDX ceases to 
work. It leaves the screen resolution of Windows (ME) set 
to the specification from the <videoemode> switch.

My main reckoning on the problem is that the files that I 
am trying to use have been compressed using DivX Codec. 
They will run on my machine, as I have the necessary 
drivers, but I was thinking that maybe DMDX cannot handle 
DivX. Do you know if this is the case?

Incidentally, I have a rather poor Video Card (2 MB), but 
it passes the tests in TimeDX, and can also run the videos 
from the demo.

I would be really grateful for any light you could shed on 
this... Thankyou

Ha!  I had the same thought, briefly, and then I repressed it because it spoiled my rosy little picture.  That propagation delay through the inverter could cause a minute change of logic state.  I'll find out tommorrow when I breadboard this thing.  If it doesn't work, there is always plan B:

Assume that the LOW pulse generated by the DMDX PIO initialization is rather short (< 20 msec).  I can reject all PIO output 'trigger pulses' shorter than 50 msec (or whatever) by using a 50 msec pulse delay and OR'ing the delayed pulse with the PIO output.  If the PIO trigger is nice and long, e.g., <RO 256, 100>, then it overlaps the delayed pulse at 50 msec and the OR gate goes low (and triggers a shock).  The only drawback is that all 'shock commands' are delayed by 50 msec.

Why go through all of this?  Because I am using a batch file to automatically sequence through a number of different DMDX based tests and accordingly DMDX is starting itself up many times over the course of 1 1/2 hours.  So, it's not practical for me to simply turn off the triggered device before starting DMDX.

Thanks for you help!

   I'm surprised you don't get a brief (like a couple of nanoseconds) pulse 
out of that circuit.  The output of the inverter on bit 1 will still be low 
when bit 7 goes low for however long it takes the signal to propagate 
through the inverter.  But I guess you can easily avoid that buy running 
bit 7 through a pair of inverters to delay it.

   Never tried it.  Patently as DMDX crashes there are still errors in the 
DivX codec.

   It will never be longer than 2ms.  Not unless something goes badly awry.

   Yeah, I'm no fan of monostables used that way and have been trying to 
think of some way of latching outputs that doesn't revolve around a timing 
component but have yet to come up with one.  Well, one that doesn't use a 
bunch of devices anyway.  Lowest component count I can come up with is to 
use a latch with a negative trigger but to put a RC filter on it so it 
takes a pulse longer than a few ms to trigger the latch.

Can anyone explain this one?  I've got DMDX installed and working fine
on my new XP system, but when I exit DMDX after having run a file my
computer annoyingly restarts itself (it doesn't happen if I open DMDX
and then close it without running an item file).

thoughts anyone?

Probably not related but some of the latest winXP hotfixes were to do with
startup/shutdown issues.  Run the machine through windows update
(http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com) or I think you can also access it in XP
under the "Automatic updates" tab in system properties.

   Get some new video card drivers, DMDX runs fine under XP.

   Also, is the video card a GeForce card?  Might need the old -buffers 4 
on the command line, even though previous systems with GeForce cards 
crashed in DMDX XP might just postpone the inevitable.

   There's an option under properties of My Computer / Advanced / "Startup 
and Recovery" to Automatically Restart under system failure.  Uncheck that, 
that way when your video drivers toast the machine you can actually see 
some diagnostics...

Hmmmm.  I'm using an analog scope, so it's not easy to see these single events, but the
LOW pulse duration looks closer to 15msec when DMDX initializes.  


2.  "... put a RC filter on it so it takes a pulse longer than a few ms to trigger ..."

I must have been reading your mind, sort of, because I followed your earlier suggestion to build some
extra delay into the trigger signal, but I used an RC network instead of more logic gates.

 
3.  I'm glad that I didn't have to resort to using a one-shot based noise discriminator because the 
trigger delays could have been inconvenient.  They might have their uses though in tough environments like 
MRI studies.  If anyone is interested, this design reference might be helpful:  www.fairchildsemi.com/an/AN/AN-366.pdf

   Odd, the system call to Sleep() is for 2 milliseconds, when I benchmark 
the retrace tracking code the calls to Sleep() that it makes are usually 
for the requested number of milliseconds.

Actually, it was my new drivers that were causing the problem.  I had
already downloaded the newest nvidia drivers for my GeForce card, which let
me use the resolution that I prefer, but they were apparently causing my
system to crash -- but again, only when I exited DMDX after running a file.
So, I reinstalled the older drivers and now everything works just fine as
far as DMDX goes.

   Hmm, the newer drivers will probably be fine if you run DMDX with 
"-buffers 4" at then end of the command line in the shortcut that runs 
DMDX.  The GeForce does everything in hardware and when DMDX asks for 24 
back buffers there isn't enough hardware to do it and NVIDIA's drivers just 
don't handle requests like that so everything melts down.  I've told them 
about it, they point blank refuse to do anything about it.  So you limit 
what DMDX asks for with the -buffers option.

Hello! I live in Argentina and I am  trying to start
some experiments with masked semantic priming. I
cannot run any item file because I have no way for
selecting the keyboard device in the Input test of
Time DX. I can test every keys but there is no box for
"accept" nor "apply", so when you open again the
dialog box I read, no
device is selected.

The errors that appear are the same for my file and
for the example files in the folder of demos:

Item file C:/DMDX/alfin.rtf
parsed file is rtfparsed.itm
getting file__ wait
Scrambled file is scramble.itm
input device <keyboard> failed

Sometimes, if the file is not in the DMDX folder, I
read this thing
not only there but on another separate window. What I
want to run is this:

N16 F100 <azk>   <cr> <fd 17> <d 169> <t 2500> <vm
1024, 768, 768, 16, 0> <id keyboard> <nfb> <dbc
255255255> <dwc 0> 
0 Press SPACEBAR or FOOTPEDAL to start; 
+101 "########" / <fd 4> "hambre" / * "POBRE" /; 
+201 "########" / <fd 4> "sangre" / * SOL" /; 
+202 "########" / <fd 4> "muerte" / * CAMA" /; 
+1 "########" / <fd 4> "higo" / * VIAJE" /; 
0 The END! Thank you for taking part.; 


The mouse cannot be tested, I have a notebook with a
touch pad.
Can anybody help me in how to select any input device?
Thank you very much,
Federico Beines

The -buffer 4 tweak worked.  Excellent!  Now I can use my Detonator XP
drivers, which allow me to use 1152X864 resolution with an acceptable
refresh rate on an otherwise crappy monitor, AND run DMDX without
crashing the system.

   Hmm, the newer drivers will probably be fine if you run DMDX with 
"-buffers 4" at then end of the command line in the shortcut that runs 
DMDX.  The GeForce does everything in hardware and when DMDX asks for 24

back buffers there isn't enough hardware to do it and NVIDIA's drivers
just 
don't handle requests like that so everything melts down.  I've told
them 
about it, they point blank refuse to do anything about it.  So you limit

what DMDX asks for with the -buffers option.

I am still in the process of preparing my first experiment with DMDX.  I
have learned that if an experiment involves 2 possible responses, one can
find out what the subject has selected in the .azk file through the +
(positive) and - (negative) signs in front of the reaction time.

With the help from Mr. Benning, I was able to write an experiment that
includes four possible responses, i.e. 1, 2, 3, and 4.  However, I just
realize that the .azk file does not record the exact choice selected by
the subject.  Since a "preferred response" is indicated along within the
stimulus frame, the .azk file only indicates whether the subject's
response MATCHES that indicated in the .rtf file through the + and -
system.  I am wondering whether there is a way for DMDX to record the
response choice selected by the subject.

For instance, in the following example that Mr. Benning kindly wrote, with
the correct answer to the fox question indicated as "1", any response
other than "1" will be treated as a negative RT in the .azk file.  And I
am wondering whether it would be possible for DMDX to record which wrong
answer the subject chose.

Dear all,

I am very sorry if this is a dumb question, but I am afraid I can't get my
head around the input device stuff related to zillion files.  Here's my
situation: I want to record on and off reponses from any of bits 0-4 from
my PIO card.  I found out recently, and disastrously too late, that DMDX
only records responses to the zil file from bits 0-2 by default - is this
correct? So, if I want bits 0-4 I have to:

(mip 7>  ( to enable the first 8 bits on the PIO card)
<vzk +Bit0> <vzk -Bit0> <vzk +Bit1> ... <vzk -Bit4>
(to ask that all these responses should be recorded to the zil file).

This still means that +Bit0 will give a REQUEST response, i.e. they will
allow the task to continue after a 0 item.

Is this correct?  Sorry if I have got confused. 

Cheers,

Matthew

   Nope, that enables the first 3 bits, it's a binary mask.  If you want 
bits 0 to 4 you want <mip 37> (it's also octal).

   Yes, that mapping will stay in effect until a <umr>.

Our PCIDIO card is designed to emulate the 8255 PIO on a 
Metrabyte card, but unlike the Metrabyte which can be hard-
wired only to 300h or 310h, our card negotiates its address 
during Plug&Play, and after that we can't safely override the 
values it gets assigned.

So we determined the address of the card (from device manager)
and it is D800 (hex). Unfortunatelly when go to do PIO test it
doesn't respond.

Thanks, 
Mario F.

Mario -- we had the same problem, and resolution requires the IO emulator
that comes with your card. If you're using the Keithley board,
installation and use are very straightforward. If that's the case, let me
know and I can point you to the necessary docs.  -Michael

   DMDX 2.7.02 is available, it fixes the busted <set N,errorrate> 
keyword.  Counter N would wind up with the lastRT value (abs(reaction 
time)).  Alternate new syntax <set cN=errorrate> always worked, only the 
old syntax was busted.

A quick question concerning the recorded results on a zil file:

All possible responses were numbers 1-9.  I am sure that the numbers were
only pressed one during the experimental runs.  However, the zil file
seems to have recorded twice.  Here is an example of what appearred on the
zil file:

Item 32
 653.19,+4 866.71,-4
Item 29
 899.21,+2 1129.53,-2
Item 33
 626.90,+4 962.09,-4

where for item 32, the subject  responded with a (4), for item 29 - a (2),
for item 33 - a (4).

SInce there seems to be 2 separate reaction times for the response, what
do they mean?  or what number should be counted as the real reaction time?
the average of the two?

Hope my question makes sense.

Sincerely,
Cheryl Leung

Looks to me like this zil file recorded the time your subject first pressed
the button down (the +# response) and when s/he released the button (the
subsequent -# response).  You'd probably want to count the first of each
pair as the response time.  If you were so inclined, you could calculate
"keypress time" from this data as a variable.

   And if you don't want to see the key release information you'll have to 
validate the keystrokes you do want recorded with <vzk +1> <vzk +2> etc.

Here's a weird one.  When we run DMDX on one of our machines, it gives the 
item number as the RT.  Below is a bit of the .azk file and a bit of the 
script.  Has anyone else had this problem.  It is Dell machine, same as all 
the other ones we run DMDX on.

Same thing happened to me yesterday when I was installing DMDX
on one of the desktop PCs in our EEG-lab. There appeared to be something
wrong with the Keyboard-drivers (it was a German keyboard but in TimeDX I
was prompted with the regular QWERTY input keys). I reinstalled the
keyboard and that solved the problem for me...

I noticed this happening when I run DMDX in Diagnostic mode (ie. when
no actual response is being given). Perhaps your machine is somehow
stuck in that mode?



<excerpt>Here's a weird one.  When we run DMDX on one of our machines,
it gives the item number as the RT.  Below is a bit of the .azk file
and a bit of the script.  Has anyone else had this problem.  It is Dell
machine, same as all the other ones we run DMDX on.

Dear Jonathon,

I've just started writing a little C program to calculate a score for a
subject, based on error rate and average reaction time, and that this score
could be calculated independently for each block of the experiment.  

I've been talking it over with my colleagues and we thought that it would
be much better if this is something that could be done within DMDX.  Rather
than having to quit DMDX, run the program (which would read information
from the azk file), then load DMDX again and start the next block off, it'd
be nice if a score print out could be called from the rtf file, and if
something in the header line could specify the weight to give to errors.

We figured this couldn't be too difficult seeing as you already calculate
error rates and you have the RTs.  Is it something you'd be able to do, or
do you know if someone has already made a patch for that?  I'm sure it'd be
very popular as a tool.  Subjects generally perform better if they are
motivated by some score they are trying to beat, especially if you promise
them some kind of alcohol-based prize if they do best! 

Many thanks
sam

   The great day dawns upon us when DMDX can use a PIO12 under windows NT, 
2000 or XP!  Yes my friends, you read right, with DMDX 2.8.00 and TimeDX 
2.2.00 as long as you install and configure the InstaCal software that 
comes with ComputerBoards' interface cards you can wire up switches under 
any version of windows.  The cost?  A freaking .DLL that has to be copied 
along with DMDX -- regardless of whether you use InstaCal stuff or not :(

   Even if you aren't using some NT derivative OS the InstaCal stuff still 
has some use as users of PCI interface cards can dispense with the nasty 
registry hacks that are currently to used to track a PCI based PIO12 as it 
moves around the system's I/O address space.  But you do have to actually 
run the InstaCal stuff and tell it to add your card to it's list of boards 
that it keeps in CB.CFG.  Then in TimeDX's PIO Test you can nominate the 
InstaCal Board that will be then enumerated as a possible device address to 
use.  Under NT/2k/XP only InstaCal devices will be listed in the PIO Test 
as to use anything else there will result in an immediate protection fault.

   The file cbw32.dll must now be copied into whatever folder DMDX lives 
in, or into some folder in the path (read windows\system32 or 
windows\system whichever folder your machine has) or the working directory 
used in a shortcut to DMDX should it be different to the directory 
containing DMDX.EXE.

   Well, in testing the new InstaCal interface I find that winXP's wondrous 
0.07ms SD of the millisecond callback doesn't translate to more accurate RT 
measurement.  In fact I find RT SDs well over 1ms so I don't recommend 
jumping onto the new OS unless you have other reasons for doing so, not at 
least until I do some more work on DMDX.  I suspect the reason lies in 
thread context switching, under win9X there is almost no delay, under winXP 
(and one would assume win2k as well) there would appear to be substantial 
delay.  So I'll have to redesign the PIO input system to use some kind of a 
queuing system that actually polls the PIO in the millisecond callback and 
then services the queue with the existing threads.  Bummer.

   OTOH, I then go and fire up TestMode 9 where DMDX is triggered by a 
photo sensor and get an SD of 0.35ms under winXP.  And that's with other 
active tasks in the background, killing them doesn't change the SD to speak 
of either.  TestMode 9 is a much truer test than TestMode 8 which I was 
using earlier on, in fact it is simply a data logger and doesn't change 
DMDX's RT gathering functionality at all.

Hello

I have just started using DMDX and am having a problem with bitmap files.
When I try to run the script I get the error:

Bitmap DIB creation failed!

The bitmaps are stored in the same folder as the .rtf file so I don't
think that's the problem.  I've searched the archive but can't find
anything there.

I'd be very grateful for any ideas people have.

Thanks

   It means the bitmaps are in a format that DMDX can't handle.  Try 
converting them to a different format.  For instance you might have 16 bit 
bitmaps that are by definition non-standard (.BMP files have either 8 or 24 
bit color), save them as 24 bit bitmaps instead.  OTOH you can convert them 
the .JPG files instead.

Now, I have a question about dmdx as a novice.. so need anyone's help. 
<br>
<br>As late as, made the experiment of 'number recognition' with dmdx for the first time and obtained zil data file. but ridiculously can't analyze it. 
<br>
<br>I need detailed analysis instructions and procedures for zil output file using dmdx software(analyze, concatenate and unloadazk.exe). 
<br>
<br>If anyone has any helpful advice on this I would be most
<br>appreciative.

   As raw .zil files stand you can't use them with the analysis tools 
provided, they are all designed to handle binary yes/no responses found in 
.AZK files, .ZIL files typically contain one of many responses.

   People typically analyze .ZIL files by importing them into some number 
cruncher (SAS, EXCEL, SPSS) and processing them there instead.

Hello,

The computer is a Pent II, Windows 95, 64 RAM, ATI 3D PRO.  I have ran 
scan disk and Norton anti-virus just to make sure they were not the 
problem.  The only problem that I found, which I dont know if it 
affects dmdx, is that the monitor driver was off.  I could not find the 
correct driver so I just put a "standard monitor type" and made sure 
the settings were exactly the same as the other two dmdx computers 
(which are similar to this one but have different model monitors).  
Dmdx will not open on this computer and I have found no reason for this 
to happen, all other utilities and programs work without problems.  It 
was also very difficult to delete the files from the hard drive, it did 
it at a very slow pace.  Once deleted I tried downloading a new dmdx 
file, but it would not copy it to a folder, it did it extremely slow or 
it froze.  I tried to copy dmdx files from the other PC's and only the 
help files for both the dmdx and timedx would copy from the disk, once 
it got to dmdx or the timedx application files it would slow down or 
freeze.  It appears that the computer has some kind of aversion to 
dmdx!  Like I said all other applications work fine, but only when you 
try to copy or run a application dmdx or timedx file does it slow down 
or freeze.  Any suggestions on what the problem maybe and how to fix 
it?  Thank you.

   Restart the computer, check whether there is in fact any free disk 
space.  If you can't copy the files then that's a basic computer failure, 
there's nothing unusual about the TimeDX or DMDX executables.  Norton AV 
has been known to interfere with DMDX's operation in the past however your 
problem is almost guaranteed to be video card driver related or DirectX 
related.  First try a later version of DirectX and if it's still screwy 
find some later video card drivers.

   Could be that windows 95 isn't usable any more, haven't had a 95 box to 
test anything on for years.  You may have to upgrade to 98SE.

Jonathan,

I already have DirectX 8.0 on the PC and there is plenty of free space 
in the hardrive.  Dmdx worked fine for 6 months and it still works fine 
in the other PC's which have much smaller HD's and also use Windows 
95.  I actually do not have Nortn AV, but use VShield.  I just now 
updated the video drive to the newest one, and the problem persists.  
The only thing I can think of is HD problems, but would not explain why 
I have been able to download and run other programs without any 
problems only when I try to open dmdx or timedx does the computer slow 
down or freeze.  Thank you for your help any more suggestions are 
welcome.  Thanks again.   

---------------------------------------------
Restart the computer, check whether there is in fact any free disk 
space. If you can't copy the files then that's a basic computer 
failure, 
there's nothing unusual about the TimeDX or DMDX executables. Norton AV 
has been known to interfere with DMDX's operation in the past however 
your 
problem is almost guaranteed to be video card driver related or DirectX 
related. First try a later version of DirectX and if it's still screwy 
find some later video card drivers.

Could be that windows 95 isn't usable any more, haven't had a 95 box to 
test anything on for years. You may have to upgrade to 98SE.

   So what changed that it was fine for 6 months and then all of a sudden 
stopped being fine?

   Could be a problem with VShield then.  If you can disable it try that 
otherwise uninstall it and then try DMDX.  If you still can't overwrite the 
files (which really sounds like an anti-virus problem) then try booting to 
command prompt and delete the DMDX and TimeDX .EXE files the old fashioned 
way.  I guess Safe Mode would work if the command prompt isn't an option.

   It could be that the machine's hardware configuration just got plain 
screwed up and nothing short of re-installing the OS is going to fix 
it.  Sometimes just installing right over the old OS is fine and everything 
is glorious without having to re-install other applications.

Hello all,
I have a problem, which I've tried to solve to no avail,  relating to
declaring a joystick as the input device. The input test tells me I have a
Sidewinder Joystick, as does windows when I test it. I used <id Sidewinder
joystick> and all possible deletions/permutations thereof, but always get
the error message that the id device is not known. What else can the thing
possibly be called??
Any ideas?
                            Merci,
                                    C. Frenck-Mestre

Hi,

have you tried <id "Sidewinder Joystick"> ?

I think the quotes may be needed,

   To address the Windows XP variability I was seeing in my testing a 
couple of new input devices have been added, QPIO12 and QPIO12output16, the 
Q standing for queued and these are now available in 2.9.00.  I didn't feel 
like just gaily modifying the existing PIO12 devices because the queuing 
adds a reasonable amount of work to be done every single millisecond and 
didn't particularly want to risk upsetting some older machines.

   Other changes included in DMDX 2.9.00 are a new test mode number 12 (10 
and 11 were used as temporary debugging test modes and will no doubt get 
used again at a later date) that monitors the duration of the millisecond 
callback which should always be 0.0ms or at worst 0.1ms.  This is a useful 
test when using InstalCal drivers and the QPIO12 input device as the 
polling of the devices is done in the callback.  If the duration of the 
callback rises nastily when using QPIO12 only polling every other 
millisecond should be considered (see <id>).  Fortunately all machines 
tested so far have negligible values in this test.
   And test modes 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 12 (and any future test modes 
similar to them) now dump their outputs into the diagnostics.txt and the 
job output file whenever the test mode is changed or the job is stopped.
   And the <set c1,999> crash was fixed (either <set c1=999> or <set 1,999> 
is valid).
   And you can't use input devices in TimeDX and DMDX that would crash the 
system anymore, they now check what OS is running and cull the devices 
appropriately.
   And when using the new queued PIO12 devices (QPIO12 and so forth) a 
third parameter can be added to the <id> keyword that increases the size of 
the queue used to buffer data. The default buffer is 16 entries long 
allowing for 16ms of buffering, some machines may require more buffering 
indicated by repeated PIO Polling FIFO full at time %dms error messages.
   And I note that using 256 color modes with NVIDIA's GeForce cards (mine 
is GeForce2 MX but I suspect these problems occur with all GeForce cards) 
under Windows XP is really problematic.  Not only do I recommend -buffers 3 
in the command line but I also recommend using 16 bit color modes if XP is 
being used.  I was getting graphical display errors using a palletized 
display mode (1024 768 768 8 0) that included things drawn in the wrong 
places along with terrible timing inconsistencies that all went away once I 
used an RGB display mode (1024 768 768 16 0).

   Using the new QPIO12 on my Athlon 850 in the office running XP with 
winamp playing a streaming 56kbps mp3 from home in the background (makes no 
difference to the scores whether or not I stop winamp) I get a SD of 0.07ms 
using test mode 2 that monitors the millisecond call back itself.  I get a 
SD of 0.48ms using test mode 6 that monitors response signal latencies with 
my input signal generator and using test mode 9 with a photosensor I get an 
SD of 0.33ms.  I figure test mode 9 is more accurate because one end of the 
interval we are measuring is determined by the raster which is accurate to 
fractions of a millisecond whereas with test mode 6 both the beginning of 
the interval and the end of the interval are determined by the millisecond 
call back.  Pretty natty stuff.

   Only thing I can think of is that you are telling DMDX to stretch the 
images with either the bitmap multipliers or by specify a bounding box for 
the bitmap by using <bmp x,y,n,m>.

   DMDX 2.9.01 and UnloadAZK 2.00 are on the web site.  DMDX 2.9.01 offers 
tuned qPIO12 performance and UnloadAZK 2.00 has better destination name 
selection for multiple users on the same machine, bigger name boxes and 
incidentally is now compiled with Visual C instead of Borland C (a change 
that should be transparent to the user but that makes a big difference to me).

We are conducting a study where we would like to provide feedback on 
the average correct reaction time within a block of 100 trials.

Trial structure is as follows:

+1 * "p" <msfd 500> / <msfd 1500>/; 
+2 * "R" <msfd 500> / <msfd 1500>/; 
-3 * "p" <msfd 500> / <msfd 1500>/; 
.
.
.
+100 * "R" <msfd 500> / <msfd 1500>/; 
0 "End of block" <msfd 2000>/c;
FEEDBACK ON AVERAGE REACTION TIME WILL BE PROVIDED NOW 

I am familiar with how to construct custom feedback and execute the 
appropriate feedback with branching.  I know that I can get access to 
the RT on each trial with LastRT.  However, I believe I will need to 
add the RTs together across trials within a block, divide by number of 
trials in block and use that average RT in the branch.  I cannot 
determine an easy way to do this.  I can construct some pretty 
complicated loops but executing each after each trial may muck with 
item timing.  Is there an easy way to calculate average RT across 
Correct trials?

Thanks for any help.

   So you call a subroutine if the response is correct that adds the LastRT 
to a summing counter and increments another counter.  Then when you want 
the feedback you set yet another counter to the summing counter divided by 
the N counter and then use <AppendCounter> to display that one.

   Maybe Photoshop needs to be told to save the image in a different format.

   Another thing is to check whether Paint displays the images in the same 
fashion as DMDX.  If not then something peculiar to DMDX is going on -- but 
I can't see it beyond settings in the item file being incorrect, DMDX uses 
GDI (part of windows) to manipulate bitmaps as does Paint.

Has anyone had any success using a touchscreen monitor with DMDX?
If yes...how would I code it as an input device AND do you have words of
caution about using this form of input?

   It would only be usable with DMDX if it presented itself as a 
DirectInput device, if it requires custom interfaces then DMDX would need 
modification.  Even if the touchscreen does provide DirectX drivers DMDX 
would only see button presses, it will ignore all axis information -- 
getting it to record axis information requires modification, getting it to 
do meaningful things with axis information requires lots of modification.

   DMTG (the immediate predecessor to DMDX) did handle input from 
somebody's touchscreen and IIRC we divided the screen into quadrants and 
they became the various buttons, a similar thing could be done with 
DMDX.  But it won't be cheap, for a start I'd need to have one of the 
touchscreens for development and for a second you'd be paying me $25 an 
hour to do it and you'd be up for at least a week's work if DMDX is to 
interpret various regions of the screen as different buttons (substantially 
less to get it to just record the axis information).  If the touchscreen is 
hellaciously expensive it could be returned once development reaches a 
certain level of stability but that complicates making any modifications to 
DMDX's handling of the touchscreen afterwards.

Hello all,

   I am a totally new kid in town of DMDX. Now I rush to make it work for 
an experiment, so I have the following questions:

(1) Can the system work without a PIO card? If impossible, what is the 
reason? If OK, what's the disadvantage (if I use the keyboard as the input) 
and how to make it?

(2) How to detect if the sound card is working for it? I guess I need to 
write some item file for it.

   Any idea or direction pointing will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

Best,
Rong

   Disadvantage is the keyboard's timing variability, usually 16ms or 
so.  See the Input section of the DMDX help:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhinput.htm

   You include <id keyboard> on the parameter line, or whatever the device 
name is on your machine, TimeDX's Input test will tell you it's name:

>write some item file for it.

   Use the TimeDX sound test:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/timedxhspeechcalibration.htm

   There are usually a couple of .WAV files in c:\windows\media.

the help file >> button is good for this.  You won't absorb even 10% of 
what's in there but when you run into a problem later on you'll recall

Will DMDX allow for tracking certain responses, and then re-running only
certain items of interest after a stop? Here are some details:
This study is for the fMRI scanner. While in the scanner, the subject will
respond to a continuous running series of 240 visual items with the one of
three letters; a, g, or l. Once the 240 items have been responded to, the
subject will come out of the scanner and continue with a different task,
but this time with only those items they responded to with the letter 'a'
and another different task with only those items they responded to with the
letter 'g'.

I'm not sure if I'm making my question clear, but if anyone can help out
with this question, I thank you in advance.

I tried running the second multi-scrambling script described in "Help" 
(where odd items are scrambled with other odd items, and even items with 
other evens). It works fine diagnostically, but when run properly, the 
experiment seems to freeze after the first item, and I end up aborting. I 
can run normal scrambling experiments with no problems. This may or may not 
be related to another quirk which I don't understand - the syntax check 
shows an error message for all scripts (something about the wrong video 
mode), but again, this doesn't prevent me from running standard experiments. 
Any thoughts on this? Thanks for your time.

   No.  I could add a switch that saves all counters to a file and another 
that loads counters from a file.  I guess I could munge the name of the 
file with the subject ID incase you don't run that subject again 
immediately but you'd have to make sure the subject ID was identical 
between runs.

   I don't see how you're going to get a keyboard into the scanner.

   Probably because the program is waiting for a request that can't 
come.  It's either mapped the request to something odd (some of my tests 
use the right mouse button for a request) or it's using another input 
device than the ones on your machine.

   You probably need to time the default video mode (640x480x8) in TimeDX.

Dear DMDXers,
             I am mailing with a particular question that I have been pondering 
for a while, but with no success.  I am hoping that there is an obvious solution 
to this problem that I am overlooking.

The problem is this:  One of the researchers in our Centre wants to present 
screens of text that are replaced on a subject's keypress with a new screen, and 
for this FILE to run for EXACTLY two minutes.  Some subjects may get through two 
screens, some through four screens and so on during the course of the two 
minutes, but what is critical is that the file ends after the two minutes, 
irrespective of how many screens of text have been displayed. 

My initial thought was that this could be achieved by making each screen of text 
a separate item, and then working out some way for DMDX to look at the RCOT 
value in a counter, which would allow a branch to the end of the file when RCOT 
exceeds two minutes.  However, as the branching is evaluated after the response 
to an item, I do not think this will work, as if a subject begins a new screen 
at 1 minute and 55 seconds, and then spends 30 seconds reading that screen, it 
will branch to the end of the file at 2 minutes and 25 seconds, not two minutes 
exactly, which is what we are after.

My second thought was to set up the file with each of the screens of text as 
frames within a single item, then set the timeout period to two minutes.  
However, with this approach, the problem then becomes how to get DMDX to present 
each new screen of text (i.e. each frame within the item) upon a subject's 
keypress.  Effectively, what I am after is something akin to the old <rc> 
keyword, however using <rc> means that each frame is treated as a new item, and 
thus the timeout period applies to each frame rather than the whole item, as we 
would like.

So, my question is really how to get DMDX to move from frame to frame within an 
item by means of a keypress (any keypress - we are not concerned with each 
subject's reading time per screen) while at the same time allowing the timeout 
parameter to apply to the whole item rather than each frame.

Any suggestions with respect to this question and/or any alternative to 
approaches to this problem would be warmly welcomed.

Many thanks,
Anna W.

   I think something along these lines is likely to be your only option, 
but I suspect it's going to take a modification to DMDX to allow it to load 
the subject timeout from a counter.  With this you can have a fairly 
straight forward item file that first loads a counter with your total 
duration (120000), each item then loads the timeout from the counter and 
after each item it subtracts the LastRT and whatever inter item interval 
there is from the counter, exits if it's negative or continues to the next 
counter.

   Well, I just had an unusually devious thought last week w.r.t. the 
problem NVIDIA's GeForce drivers have with DMDX.  If you recall I've 
contacted them about the problem, they admit the problem exists and then 
have the gall to ask me why I should want to do what DMDX does.  End of 
problem.  Until it suddenly occurs to me 18 months later that if NVIDIA 
couldn't get Microsoft WHQL certification for their drivers they might just 
fix the problem... I just got a response from the WHQL team expressing 
their eagerness to include my code in their tests so we might just see some 
improvement using GeForce cards without the "DMDX.EXE -buffers 4" kludge ;)

I have obtained some money for setting up a lab. I need information
regarding 
1) what accessories in addition to a computer are needed to set up a
complete test station for LDT, naming, translation, stroop, dichotic
listening tasks(such as preamplifier, button box, head set, cassette
recorder, etc.), 
2) what brand names work well with dmdx, and 
3) where to buy them (such as a button box).
Any information will be appreciated.

Best,

   Well, I just had an unusually devious thought last week w.r.t. the 
problem NVIDIA's GeForce drivers have with DMDX.  If you recall I've 
contacted them about the problem, they admit the problem exists and then

have the gall to ask me why I should want to do what DMDX does.  End of 
problem.  Until it suddenly occurs to me 18 months later that if NVIDIA 
couldn't get Microsoft WHQL certification for their drivers they might
just 
fix the problem... I just got a response from the WHQL team expressing 
their eagerness to include my code in their tests so we might just see
some 
improvement using GeForce cards without the "DMDX.EXE -buffers 4" kludge
;)

   Well, you certainly don't need a cassette recorder anymore, a half way 
decent sound card like the Creative Labs SBLive proveds does a passable job 
of recording subject utterances and playing back stimuli.  A Creative Labs 
Audigy has a 100dB S/N ratio so that's almost pro quality.

   The only non-standard thing you need is a PIO interface card:

Many thanks for this information, Jonathan - it is a great relief to know that I 
was at least on the right track with my initial idea.  Loading the timeout from 
a counter is an elegant solution to the problem that hadn't occurred to me.

The offer is very much appreciated - I'll find out if the investigator is 
prepared to do this and let you know.

Thanks again,
Anna W.

I've hunted for this on the website with no success (did I miss it?): How
can one remap the keys, such as POS and NEG, for a PIO input?

Thanks.

   Oops, hit the send button by accident.  +Bit 0 is usually request, +Bit 
1 NEG and +Bit 2 POS so you map them as you would map keyboard keys.  See:

   DMDX 2.9.04 stops the exit button causing DMDX to exit when Test Vox is 
run ;)  I knew there was a reason I never made that button actually exit 
DMDX.  Well, it works properly now.

   This was tangentially brought to my attention by someone in China having 
a problem with the Test Vox command but I think their problem is related to 
their OS version, I think I might have broken DMDX's ability to function 
under older OSes like Windows 95 a year or two ago.  I can't test '95 
anymore so I can't verify the problem.

   Would people that have not used the VOX Test in DMDX yet kindly do so 
just to make sure the test runs and doesn't fail with an error about 
loading something like control 6 of resource 3?  There is a user of a 
Chinese version of windows that is getting a straight forward error that 
just plain doesn't occur on any other machines I've heard about, if others 
could verify this I might redesign the test -- otherwise there's something 
clearly wrong with his machine's configuration.

Thanks for all those who help on this listserv. I've learned alot, but I 
have a few questions:

1. Is there anyway of moving feedback to a different part of the screen? 
Say, the center? Right now it displays on the lower half of the screen.

2. Why are all the refresh rates 0 Hz? We would like to run experiments at 
120 Hz, but DMDX seems to prefer 75 Hz. Is there any way to change this?

Thanks in advance.

If you're doing a naming experiment, then yes.  See the info on
the<DVOXBeepSpec> keyword in the helpfile.

   You'll have to build a custom feedback routine, see The Call keyword:

   That's the display drivers.  Despite claims to the contrary I've never 
seen any drivers ever enumerate anything other than 0Hz.  There are NVIDIA 
semi-supported utilities to tinker with the display rates that their 
drivers expose to programs but I'm betting the 75Hz that DMDX uses is a 
function of your monitor, ie your monitor won't go any faster than 
75Hz.  Buy a better monitor and I'll bet you get faster display rates out 
of DMDX.

Well, when we have our desktop set to 1024x768 32bpp @100Hz and we run
TimeDX at 1024x768 32 Bpp 0Hz, TimeDX changes the refresh rate to 75Hz while
it is doing the Video tests (we can confirm this using the menu on the
monitor itself).

I will try tomorrow to see if it changes to 75 Hz during an experiment. The
hardware we have is a Dell P780 and a fast ATI video card which we can run
at 120Hz at 800x600 and 100Hz at 1024x768.

Thanks for your help.

   If you see TimeDX using 75Hz then as long as you tell DMDX to use the 
same video mode (in this case <vm 1024 768 768 32 0> in the parameter line 
of the item file) DMDX will also use 75Hz -- there wouldn't be much point 
to TimeDX otherwise.

   You don't need a superior monitor if the desktop can run at the higher 
refresh rates, you just need to figure out how to get ATI's drivers to 
expose those refresh rates to games, specifically DirectX 
applications.  Maybe there's some control hidden away in the Advanced 
properties of the display adapter.  I can't help much, I got rid of my ATI 
video card a few weeks ago but if I were you I'd try searching the web for 
keywords like "ATI refresh rate fix".

We would very much like to use DMDX with Windows 2000, but we installed 
Keithley PIO24 cards last year, not the MetraByte or ComputerBoards PIO 
cards. For that reason, I could not make the InstaCal drivers recognise our 
hardware.

At the moment we are using the Keithley cards with the KPCI-PIO24 I/O 
Emulator under Windows 98. This works fine on all of our lab computers, but 
for other reasons we would like to move to Windows 2000 in the future. The 
emulator uses direct i/o, so cannot be used in Win2000.

Does anybody know how of a way to use our Keithley PIO cards with DMDX in 
Windows2000?

Thanks,

   Well you'd have to get whatever driver kit it is that Keithley provide 
to drive their cards under NT/2k/XP and I'd have to integrate that into 
DMDX.  Their kit is not likely to be free nor would I be doing the 
integration for free and you'd also have to buy me a Keithley card.  So 
unless you're looking at a large number of PIO cards buying ComputerBoards 
cards is likely to be cheaper.

Thanks for your response.

We have about 20 computers with Keithley PIO cards here, so buying new 
cards would be a problem.

Are there more people out there with this problem?

For anyone having similar problems, I have discovered part of a fix.
Download the DirectX control panel applet (it comes with the directx SDK,
but not with the version we're all likely to have) at
http://www.digital-digest.com/dvd/downloads/directxcpl.html or anywhere else
you can find it.

Install it, start it, and go to the DirectDraw tab. You can force refresh
rates there.

   Yeah, well at 20 machines your cost is significant.  I've just browsed 
all over the Keithly website and had little luck in turning up WDM drivers 
and or development kit (which is what is needed under NT/2k/XP).  There's a 
useless DriverLINKS thing but it'll be a cold day in hell that DMDX 
interfaces to someone's ActiveX controls belive me.  Their contacts page 
isn't exactly helpful but I'll send off an inquiry and see what turns up.

Thank you very much! I have been using their DriverLINX interface for a 
little C++ program: it is not ideal, but it certainly works. I share your 
thoughts on ActiveX.

A DirectInput driver for the Keithley PIO card would probably be a 
solution, but I don't think I'm able to write one, I'm afraid. Otherwise, 
maybe a duplicate of the CBW32.dll file, containing the calls you use, but 
now connected to the Keithley card through DriverLINX could work. I might 
be able to produce that, given information about the interface you use.

Thanks,

Maarten

   Well, here's the Keithly reply:

====================================================================
Our DriverLINX driver is the ONLY driver we support.  Have you considered a
different API or using the COM object?  Please see the attached program for
more information.

NOTE: You do need to install the DriverLINX driver to use this API.
====================================================================

   Given the rep's use of caps I doubt that we'll see a DirectInput driver.

   I guess if you've written a small program already I can peruse it to see 
if it makes my life easier, certainly their attached program was a mess of 
object oriented MFC junk.  If so that will considerably lower any 
remuneration you would need to provide me.  I would still require you to 
get me a Keithly card for testing that would stay here.

Has anyone come across, and solved my problem, which is that I cannot use
the Escape key to end the DMDX run ! (Hence the whole system just hangs at
the end of a run and has to be rebooted )

Indeed if I try running the TIMEDX keyboard test, when I press Escape, the
key hit doesnt even get to TIMEDX, instead the PC escapes completely from
TIMEDX.

My system is an AMD ATHLON 1400 MHz with a standard Microsoft keyboard..

OK problem solved already  this turns out to me a manifestation of the
GforceMX graphics problems described elsewhere  it just doesnt look like
one since it seems to affect the keyboard.
The usual fix (-buffers 4) seems to cure it.

   So what does you last item look like?  Have you tried putting an L 
switch (last item switch) in the last item?  Perhaps you have something 
after the end of the last item that breaks my end of item file checks.

   The documentation mentions that keys hit in that test still perform 
their usual function.  While I wouldn't expect the ESC key to terminate 
TimeDX I would expect it to end the test, testing it on my XP machine 
yields a thread error so something is going awry.

   Pretty sure DMDX has been used with a MS keyboard before.

    Yeah.  Twice Ken has come to me with new and worrying errors in 
DMDX.  Takes me a few seconds to remember he has a GeForce video card at 
home, problem solved each time.

Is there any way to change the abort key (for the experiment) from ESC to 
something else? We don't want subjects to be able to escape so easily. Or 
at all, really. I thought of binding Escape to something else, but that 
doesn't work.

Any suggestions?
Thanks in advance.

   Well if you get this email I suspect the DMDX list serv is back up and 
resistant to spam.  It's now about twenty times faster than it used to be 
so archive searches will be much faster.

I included Korean fonts in the item file using MS Word 2000. It did not
work. Is it something I cannot do yet or something I don't know how to do
it properly? Can we use non-romanized characters in DMDX?

Thanks.

   If you can get Wordpad to display the font DMDX should display it.  It's 
possible Word 2000 is using non-standard RTF codes for your characters in 
which case Wordpad will remove them.

In addition to using WordPad as editor, please to the following things:

(1) Check your computer using TimeDX to find out what Korean words are used in it to represent the "keyboard".
(2) In the control line of the DMDX program, key in the word "keyboard" (in <id "keyboard">) you find in the first step.
(3) In the program lines, "mapping response" (mr) should be added whenever keyboard responses are needed. See the following example.

0 <mr +Space> "Press Space........

Using these steps, we are able to present Chinese, thus you should be able to present Korean. Good luck.

Some non Latin language specific RTF words can be removed in Notepad/MS DOS 
Edit without damaging the look of the font.  We have had to do that a few 
times with Arabic.

Hello to all! 
I am writing  from Spain and the reason is the following one: We are 
trying to carry out a task of priming masked by means of program DMDX. 
For it we have unloaded the last existing update. 
Everything seems to go correctly but when we executed Timedx and within 
him Input Test appears to us the following error: <Device is interrupt 
driven>.
And when executing any task in DMDX appears the following message : 
<Input device keyboard selection failed>.
We have used different operating systems  (W95, W98, Wmillenium) and 
executed the program in different computers, but always  happens the 
same error. Directx installed is updated and we have verified any other 
possibility that was related but we have not obtained that the program 
works. What we are making bad? It is a problem of the program or is 
that we cannot use it in Spain? 
We thank for your next answer. 
A greeting from Spain.

Similar to the message about Korean above, you will need to have the word 
"keyboard" in spanish.  Use TimeDX Basic Tests to find out what the 
keyboard is called, e.g. for French you need <id "clavier">

   That's not an error message, it's a good message.  Read the Input 
section of the DMDX help.

   As Mike says, see what TimeDX uses for the name of the keyboard and use 
<id spanish-keyboard-name> in the parameter line of your item file.  You 
will have to specifically bind the response keys, read the Input section of 
the DMDX help.

   Well, at much expense to the management (me) mainly measured in shot 
brain cells and lost hair we have a DMDX list server again.  It only talks 
to a couple of windows boxes now so hopefully (knocks on head) the thing 
will stay up and intact for a year or two before I have earn any more linux 
badges.

   Apologies to whoever it was in Hong Kong who sent me a chinese font 
problem while the list serv was down, I redirected the thing to what I 
thought was my work email address but it has yet to surface (if it ever will).

I have an item file like the following. I want to scramble the items.
But, actually items [105, 205, 305] are a set. I want them to be displayed
in order. Same thing for the items [106, 206, 306]. They make one set
together. I don't want them to be scrambled. But, I want [105, 205, 305] and [106,
206, 306], the different sets to be scrambled. How do I do that?

Thanks in advance...

   Use the Grouping parameter, G.  In your case you want G3 in the 
parameter line.  Note each group of three items now counts as one item for 
the purposes of determining the value of the S parameter.

Does anybody have any experience in using dmdx for doing erp studies? I
would be grateful for any answers to this question, but I am also
looking for an answer to a more specific question: How can we make sure
that the eeg signal has a mark at a particular point in the presentation
of the stimulus material?

Another question concerns doing baby studies. In our lab we do a lot of
work with infants, where we measure their looking time to certain
stimulus items. Is it possible for dmdx to video-tape a baby's response?

thanks in advance,

Ruben van de Vijver

In our lab, we split out the RGB channels from the video card and plug them
into three different channels in our Neuroscan system, then run the
experimental program while recording a continuous EEG file.  As long as the
stimulus onset sends visibly larger (or smaller) amounts of activation to
at least one of the channels, you can then examine the epoched file to see
if the point at which the trigger occurred matches the point at which the
stimulus material was presented.  For example, if your monitor displays a
black background when stimuli are not being displayed, any stimulus that
takes up a significant amount of the screen will activate the channels and
show up in the epoched file.  If you have audio stimuli instead, feed the
output from the computer's sound card (or other noise generator) into the
Neuroscan amp (or whatever system you use).  This is about as low a level
of stimulus-trigger matching that you can get.  You'll want to collect this
timing data at a sampling rate at around 10 times that of the timing
precision you want (e.g. if you want 1ms timing, you'll want to sample
every .1ms, or at 10,000 Hz) so that you have ample resolution to
investigate the timing.

   Around here people use an interface card and the O switch to output 
codes to the recording machine when the display is active.  See:

   No, it will play digital video, it won't record it.  You could get it to 
control an external video machine with a bit or two of the interface card's 
output.

Hi, Everyone,

I will use DMDX to write a primed-naming experiment in which the naming 
latency of participants would be recorded. For the Audio Input, I've read the 
updated page written by Prof. Forster,

"Two special input devices interface with DirectSoundCapture, the DigitalVOX 
device and the RecordVocal device. The DigitalVOX input device does away with 
external electronic voice keys using a microphone and sound card instead and 
the RecordVocal input device writes the subject's vocalization to disk."

But I am not sure where I can download or find out the Direct Sound Capture. 
Also, which kind of microphone and sound-recording software can be used as 
DigitalVOX and RecordVocal devices?

Thank you.

Darius

Hi Darius,

Direct Sound is part of DirectX, which you should already have installed to 
run DMDX. No other sound recording software is needed, so all you need is a 
microphone that can plug into your sound card.

Some microphones are specially made for computer soundcards, or you can use 
a microphone and preamplifier with a connector to your soundcard.

Hello, I am preparing a self paced reading experiment and I'm new to 
DMDX. I cannot get DMDX to display the following question plus 
answers as I want. I'd like the participant to view the question and 
two possible answers below the question, as one frame, as follows:


What does the last word you read rhyme with?

          bun               scam


So far I'm  getting 'bun' and 'scam' on the same line as the 
question. Note also that I want a space between the question and the 
answers. Can somebody help me?

Do a search in the DMDX help file for "Text Row keyword". Here's an
example:

0<ln -2> "To answer YES, press the key marked [Y].", <ln -1> "To answer
NO, press the key marked [N]." , <ln 3> "Please press SPACEBAR to

I shouldn't think there is a problem with a space between the words though
I've not tried this myself.

There's a DMDX tutorial at
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language/DMDX/dmdx_tutorial.html together
with some example scripts (including a self paced reading experiment). It
is also well worth reading the whole of the DMDX help file through -- it's
not easy on the first attempt but will save you time in the long run!

Hi  DMDX folks,

   I believe this will be very easy to some of you.

   A problem is about terminating an item file. After the subject monitor 
shows the final material, the screen will stop there. And on the 
experimenter screen, no mouse arrow shows up. Mouse moving and clicking 
help to jump in the box of picking RTF files to run, but the error like 
'video not ready' comes out. Alt+F4 will cause no data to be saved. Then 
running any DMDX file needs restarting pc.

   I am wondering if it's relevant to the end of my item file. It ends like:
=2789<fd 50> "+"/*"ninety eight";               (The last stimulus)
$
0"End of the session! ";
$



   I appreciate your time and suggestion.


Best,
Rong

If I understand your question right, you should be able to just hit the
Escape key on your keyboard, at which point a prompt asking you if you want
to save your data will pop up (usually, you'll want to say yes to this
unless you're just debugging).

   I'm currently porting DMDX to the Microsoft Visual C++ 6 compiler and 
there will be several repercussions.  First, the version number will be 3 
and the previous 3D work will be dropped.  Also, there will be a semi-major 
version number (as in 3.0.0.00) added as I expect version 3 will be around 
for large number of years.  I don't think the 3D path is going to eventuate 
so DMDX's current structure is likely to have extreme longevity and I'm 
going to need more flexibility for version numbers.  Lastly, Windows 95 
support is going to be dropped.  The current version 2.9.05 will get 
archived for anyone that needs 95 for an OS as 1.3.01 is currently archived 
for anyone that needs 486 processor support.  Other than that no one should 
be able to tell the difference although several aspects of the program are 
likely to become significantly optimized (notably the high performance 
timer code).  There may be other repercussions, I'll know as the work proceeds.

Hi

I'm setting up experiments for auditory presentation.  Each of 10 words is 
saved as a separate wav file and five of those words are randomly selected 
for each trial, e.g. trial 1 might have: word10.wav, word5.wav, word2.wav, 
word 4.wav and word1.wav.

The script is working fine but we don't know how to get DMDX to play the 
wav files at a constant volume, so wav file 1 doesn't sound louder than wav 
file 2.  Is it possible to do this within DMDX or do we need to go to an 
audio edit software program.

Thanks in anticipation

   Yes, but you'll have to determine the volumes empirically, there's no 
automatic way to normalize wave files.  OTOH, using something like CoolEdit 
2000 will let you normalize everything automatically, it's even got the 
ability to batch the same commands to a bunch of files so theoretically 
it's one command once it's setup.

   I thoroughly recommend actually reading the help files with DMDX.  From 
the root of the DMDX help file (available by pressing the Help button from 
DMDX's primary dialog when it's running):

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhdmdx.htm

   Follow the link to the Sound section:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhsound.htm

   Down the bottom it mentions:

As of version 0.26 of DMDX precise control over the panning and volume of a 
buffer is offered. Two new keywords are available to exercise this control, 
<pan> and <volume>.
   Or you could look at the Keywords section:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhkeywords.htm

   And then Audio keywords:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhaudiokeywords.htm

   Then there's Set the Volume of a .WAV file:

Hi I am trying to run dmdx on a laptop Toshiba TE2000

I have pictures which I wish to display for a short time

I have had little success=20
I'm having several problems from which the following questions emanate

when I try and set up the video mode the following message appears

error massage  when setting the video is DDERR_invalidpixelfromat =
(88760091) pixel format was invalid as specified
I have set the video mode to 1024*768*16bit =20

my display adapter is a trident cyberblade XP AiT
DAC integrated ram

Do I need to load a newer version of  DMDX from the net  win 2000? =
however I have tried this and can no longer access this page.

Any help at this stage , would be appreciated

   Hmm, how interesting.  You're sure the laptop is capable of 
1024x768?  Maybe it's only a 800x600 or 640x480 LCD and it freaks when you 
try to go beyond what it's capable of.  OTOH, it is complaining about the 
pixel format so you might try 1024x768x8 or 1024x768x32 (or 1024x768x24 if 
it doesn't enumerate the 32 bit mode).

Hi Jonathan

I still keep getting the error message when setting the video is...
DDERR_invalidpixelformat
>(88760091) pixel format was invalid as specified.....when trying to run the
test on basic video mode......HOWEVER when I run my own experiment (dot
probe) I find that it runs ok on 1024, 786, 786, 16,0...the only problem is
that the colour quality of the picture (bmp) gets better as the picture gets
larger??. Unfortunately I need face images 4 by 6cm on the laptop screen.
These pictures appear with small square matrix format with the edges
(inconsistant)of the squares bright coloured (green red)are clearly
visable.. depending on the closest tone colour... Is there a pixel problem
here? I have set the colour format/setting in the display (control
panel)several times but find that I keep coming up with the above error

arch

   Settings in the control panel have no relevance at all, they control the 
desktop and DMDX does not use the desktop.  I expect you are doing 
something invalid, if you can't run the basic test in TimeDX how are you 
timing it's parameters?  And if you can't time it's parameters you sure 
can't select that video mode in DMDX.

   Assuming there's some communication problem and I'm not understanding 
your description of the error I suggest you go hunt up some newer display 
drivers as the old ones are almost guaranteed to be the cause of your problems.

   In the process of interfacing DMDX 3 to the utterly wretched and totally 
overpriced Keithley KPCI-PIO24 it occurs to me that as a side effect of 
it's pathetic driver interface it's going to solve the spike problem 
someone was having a few months ago.  The card is not configurable by DMDX, 
it has to be configured by the user (good luck figuring out how to to that) 
but once it has been configured (and the machine restarted of course) it's 
that way the whole time windows is running -- which means there won't be 
any glitches as DMDX configures it (because DMDX can't configure it).  So 
whoever was trying to get DMDX to trigger an external device but was 
getting false triggers as DMDX started running the job might solve their 
problems by buying one of these once I release version 3 -- but at 3 times 
the cost of a Computer Boards card it's pretty hard to recommend.

   Hmm, the reasons to dislike Keithley interface cards and their 
DriverLINX drivers keep on piling up.  If I benchmark the routines by 
calling them 1000 times consecutively they corrupt the stack and things 
generally go to hell in hand basket.  Ok, I can live with that, we just 
bench them by calling them 10 times.  But the results of benchmarks are 
shocking, it takes more than a 10th of a millisecond to call their routines 
and of course it takes three calls to modify all 3 ports on the 
card.  Haven't seen those kind of figures since the polling of old analog 
joysticks.  Compare that with the Computer Boards' interface card InstaCal 
drivers that take just over 1 microsecond, one hundred times faster and one 
third the price.

   Looks like DMDX 3.0.0.00 is ready for release so it's now the current 
version up on the web page.  TimeDX 3.0.00 will have to be used to setup 
all the registry keys containing settings and timing information for video 
modes as versions 1, 2, and 3 use different branches of the 
registry.  Changes include DirectX 7 being the minimum version of DirectX 
needed, Windows 95 support has been dropped, the Computer Boards cbw32.dll 
need not be included anymore unless their hardware is actually going to be 
used, the syntax check now checks the correct <vm> registry key, support 
for the overpriced Keithley cards has been added using the wretched 
DriverLINX drivers, <RevertOutput> has been tweaked to allow setting the 
initial output state, and DMDX now doesn't allow reprogramming number of 
display lines under NT/2k/XP (which would just throw a protection 
fault).  And I can now use a halfway modern compiler for DMDX...

Hello,
I have just set up a self paced reading experiment with DMDX. It 
displays text line by line separately. The problem I am having is 
that on some lines I get faint dots ( making up the shape of a 
rectangle) appearing on the screen under the line. This is 
distracting for the participants. The puzzle is that these dots do 
not appear on all runs of the same stimulus file, only on some runs, 
and I can't work out what triggers them. I am using the command  <os 
5,0,2,5> in the parameter line to erase all stray pixels.

Has anyone had this problem before?

Thanks

Hi Maria,

you could try increasing the final number of the os command (e.g., <os 
5,0,2,6>), which increases the chances of catching stray pixels below the text.

If you have randomised ordering of trials you might want to look at whether 
the problem occurs consistently on the trial *after* certain trials (with 
"g"s or "y"s or other low hanging letters). This is a problem we had!

Hi Jonathan,

Thanks very much. I've just tried it, and it seems to work in Windows 2000 
with the overpriced Keithley card.

There are two problems I encountered:

When you run a script for the first time everything goes fine. But when it 
has finished and you restart DMDX and try again there's an error message: 
"Error 0 setting up DriverLINX Device 0"

Also, DMDX doesn't seem to respond to the ESC key anymore, making it 
impossible to stop a running script.

Maarten

   The Keithley DriverLINX crap has crashed, the ESC most definitely hasn't 
changed function.  I had the damndest time finding a combination of calls 
that didn't screw the machine up, patently the combination I wound up with 
that works on my winME machine doesn't work under win2k.  The problem would 
only occur as the second job was stopped, if you exited DMDX between runs 
everything was fine, run two jobs in a row though and the Keithley 
CloseDriverLINX() call crashes.  Well, try using <id qpio12>, for a start 
the qpio12 device's timing will be better under win2k than the pure pio12 
device and for a second it also has the nice effect of not crashing the 
DriverLINX crap.  The problem originates from the fact that DMDX is 
massively multithreaded and DriverLINX does not handle threads at all well 
and when using a pio12 device there has to be two threads that have to have 
access to the PIO12, the qpio12 OTOH is all accessed from the kernal 
callback so it should be fine.

Hi,
does anybody know a trick how you can make branching faster?
I want to  present many stimuli to subjects and depending on their
responses branch to different locations. The problem is that subjects must
not be aware which action has an effect on the sequence. Unfortunately,
sometimes the next item is about 400 lines away which takes up to 10
seconds. Is there any way to speed this up?
Thanks
Jan

What takes time is the enforced delay between items. You can set this to a 
lower value (e.g. 0) using the <delay> keyword in the top line of your item 
file.
However, you'll then need to add a blank frame at the start of each item so 
that there is a sensible pause between items.

Hope this helps,

Matt

   Another thing is to make sure you're using 2.2.00 or later of DMDX as 
that's when code that buffers item locations got added and therefore once 
an item's location is encountered any future branches to it should be all 
but instantaneous.  Unless I broke the buffering code of course...

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhbranchdiagnosticskeyword.htm

   If you turn that on you should see messages like the following:

Item %d Not Found beforehand, searching forwards instead

   They should disappear once the item that is being branched to has been 
executed once if the branch buffering is functioning.  If you download 
3.0.0.01 there will be an additional branch diagnostic for use of buffered 
item locations:

Using buffered location for branch to item %d

   If you always see the former message I've screwed something up and 
you're welcome to send your item file to me at jforster@email.arizona.edu.

   Ahah, one last thing occurs to me.  Assuming the branch item location 
buffering is working but your item file is always branching to new item 
numbers so the buffering isn't of much use you could force buffering of all 
item locations ahead of time by branching to the end of the item file in 
the first item and then at the end branch back to the second item.  That 
way DMDX parses the whole item file first and all unique item number 
locations are buffered beforehand.  If ending the item file is a problem 
the destination at the end of the item file doesn't necessarily have to be 
the literal last item, just past all the branch destination items.  Or you 
can use the last frame keyword to end the run.  Now I can go to sleep...

Congratulations Jonathan and Ken! I was just reading it and thinking what a 
thorough job you had done.

People on this list may also be interested to hear about a paper that Kathy 
Rastle and I have just published describing the DMDX software voice key 
(DigitalVox) and comparing results obtained with DMDX, a standard 
electronic voice key, and hand marking of acoustic onsets. You can read 
more here:

Rastle, K., & Davis, M. H. (2002). On the Complexities of Measuring Naming. 
Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 
28(2), 307-314.

Or email me for a pdf copy.

Cheers,

Matt

Hi Jonathan,

I tried that, and it works fine: both problems seem to be solved now.

I will try to do some test to determine how well the timing is in this 
setup (DMDX 3.0, Win2000, Keithley PIO) and let you know the results.

Thanks,

Maarten

I downloaded DMDX 3.0 today and spend a few minutes (only) playing with it.  Every time I launch DMDX I get a DriverLINX pop up window that asks me to select the PIO-12 device.  Is there a way of avoiding this pop-up?

Why?  Because I have a 90 minute battery of psychophysiological tests written in DMDX that runs automatically from a "dos" batch file.  The pop-up window would force me to wake up every couple of minutes to keep things running :)

Providing that DMDX 3.0 works out for me, I'll migrate the system from Windows 98 to Windows 2000 or beyond.

(context: DMDX 3.0, Windows 98, Keithley PIO-12) 

Thank you,

Derek Eder


P.S.  DMDX version 2.? has been wonderful to me this past year!

   That's DriverLINX for you, it's pathetic -- all their programming 
examples are dialog boxes, well guys, if I'm writing a program perhaps 
maybe I want to automate this process, just maybe?  Their whole modus 
operandi is wrong.

   You selected the device in TimeDX's PIO test and so forth?  I never saw 
any dialog like you describe but then I never ran DMDX from the command 
line with DriverLINX so maybe there's something I can replicate at work 
tomorrow.  Perhaps you've got some weird setting set in the DriverLINX 
configuration that requires manual intervention.

   I would certainly hope this is possible but knowing DriverLINX nothing's 
certain.

   Another thing is that DMDX now has a chain command that makes batch 
files less mandatory than previously:

   If you need control across chains then counters can be saved and restored:

Just a little more background on the problem:

1)  Running DMDX or TIMEDMDX (version 3.0) always begins with an "Open Driver LINX" pop-up menu which asks you to select either the PIO-12 driver or the Windows 95/3.* legacy drivers.

2)  The file: C:\DrvLINX4\bin\aboutdx.exe generates this "op-up".  But!  disabling this file (and rebooting) does not stop the behavior with DMDX.

3)  DMDX does not need this "pop-up" to function.   Clicking "Cancel" or <escape> exits the 'pop-up' and DMDX starts normally.


I want to stick with a batch file 'chaining' of DMDX item files because I feed the subject ID to DMDX through a %1 argument to the batch file call and do a few DOS things like renaming and moving .AZK files.  This is a bit of a pain in the ascii in Windows 98 because Win98 'dos' mode does not recognize extended file names (e.g., NOT:  cd\my DMDX directory\e_meter validation.azk)

   Hmm, I suspect you have to run the DriverLINX configuration program.

   And there was I complaining about GeForce cards needing the number of 
back buffers restricted to 4.  ATI's Radeon VE needs to have the number 
reduced to 1.  Maybe it's better with XP but I'm not willing to try it, I 
tried all versions of their drivers under Windows ME but all fail miserably.

   This one's huge but till version 3 settles down and I've finished adding 
things I'm just using minor version numbers.  I just discovered a flag 
added in DirectX 7 that actually allows TimeDX to see all the different 
refresh rates as long as you're using Windows XP.  It might work with 2k 
too but I don't have a 2k box that I care to check this on, it definitely 
doesn't work on ME or 98.  You'll have to explicitly use that refresh rate 
in DMDX, for instance <vm 800, 600, 600, 16, 100>, but that was always the 
intention anyway.

   Why shouldn't that go to the list?  You've found that the card is usable 
under XP.

   "buffers -1" only applies to DMDX, TimeDX only ever uses one 
buffer.  You might try the options that come with the Retrace Test, perhaps 
they will rectify the estimation errors.  Override the automatic values if 
you notice TimeDX still gets the retrace interval wrong, the thing isn't 
perfect and driver writers are continually doing things to foil detection 
of the hardware's state.  Don't forget to set the sleeping time to 3 or so 
milliseconds less than the retrace and the timeout to .5 milliseconds or so 
over the retrace interval.

Hi,

I always get the following error message when I try to use DMDX Test Vox and TimeDX Sound Test for speech input. 

  CreateCaptureBuffer failed 
  DSERR_ALLOCATED (8878000a)
  The call failed because the resources (such as a priority level) were already being used by another caller

According to the advice in the help file, I successively shut down several running tasks with the cntrl-alt-del End Task button and looked for which one is the culprit. I found no task responsible for the errors. Are there any other possibilities for the error message. 

My Windows 98 system is running on a Pentium III machine with a CIO-DIO24, a Soundblaster AWE64 card (ISA), and a MS serial mouse.

Hope someone can help me. Thanks in advance.

I am trying to write a staircase method routine, but I keep running into
problems because of the one branch per item restriction. Is there a way of
using the <bicGT N1,N2,N3> keyword as part of a multiway branch (with, for
example <biw>)? I would like to loop a single item a certain number of
times as long as it is being correctly responded to, but break out of the
loop when an error is made. If anyone has done something like this I would
greatly appreciate their help. Thanks

   No, the counter branches aren't part of <mwb> and I don't think I'd ever 
add them either as they break the general syntax of <mwb>.  But what you 
can do is stick your tests after the item with <SkipDisplay> items and do 
more tests beyond the first test in the item that gathers the response as 
the condition flags stay set till the next response is gathered.  Actually 
your design doesn't even have to rely on the conditions not getting reset:

~10 set c1=10;
+11 "target" * <biw 12>;
~0 <dec 1>  <bi -11, c1.gt.0>;
~12;

   Another huge change to TimeDX's video routines, this one applicable to 
everybody and not just XP users.  First the minor part and that is that it 
occurred to me that without TimeDX enumerating any 0Hz refresh rates 
anymore the default 640x480 video mode of DMDX was no longer time-able, 
oops.  So now under XP the video modes for 0Hz default refresh rates all 
get enumerated first and then following are all the specific refresh rates 
for all the video modes.

   Now the juicy stuff, I finally crafted a reliable refresh rate detection 
routine!  Hurrah!  Only took three or four years but the solution finally 
hit me this morning (in meditation, where else) after noticing that the old 
code was overestimating the retrace interval on my GF4 XP machine (by up to 
0.5ms) and there have been reports of it getting the rate wrong by as much 
as 1.5ms on other machines.  So now the code has a mechanism for reliably 
detecting when a flip is missed during the Retrace Rate Detection and 
assuming you haven't turned off the lovely new Enhanced rate Detection mode 
it will just keep on waiting till it gets 100 uninterrupted cycles (or 
whatever you set it to) or it times out after the set limit.  To enforce 
the new code new registry forks are used (that DMDX 3.0.0.02 reads) so 
re-timing all video modes is mandatory.

   Guess I should clarify that before someone infers the wrong thing 
here.  Reliable code that determines what the refresh rate is in 
TimeDX.  Once DMDX knows the retrace interval, even approximately, it can 
accurately determine when retraces occur.  What is at issue is TimeDX 
determining what that retrace rate is in the first place without any notion 
of it's actual frequency.  Previously on a small number of machines TimeDX 
needed human intervention to get that retrace interval correct to a small 
fraction of a millisecond (people who read the help files would know this), 
with the advent of XP and radically different video drivers the error rate 
started to go up alarmingly.  So while the enhanced code I just crafted 
today to determine the retrace interval in TimeDX's Retrace Rate Test whose 
data is used in the Vertical Retrace Test that stores data for DMDX's 
determination of the raster state is not the ultimate solution that would 
mathematically determine the frequency of a signal given a number of data 
points with missing samples and significant variability in any given sample 
what it can determine without error (as near as I can tell) is when a 
retrace is missed when trying to determine the retrace interval.  So it can 
just keep waiting till it gets a known number of good samples, there will 
still be some variability in there but over 100 retrace intervals this 
should be a small fraction of a millisecond which is just fine.

NEW RELEASE OF ANALYZE V2.01


Modification to Subject Rejection Criterion.

         In previous versions of ANALYZE, the decision to reject the data 
from a subject altogether was made by specifying a limit on the error 
rate.  For example, including the following line in the .spc file:

subject_rejection: 20

meant that any subject who made more than 20% errors would be 
excluded.  However, this error rate was calculated only over the items 
specified for analysis in the .spc file  (also the case for deciding on the 
SD cutoffs).

         This is appropriate for determining the SD cutoffs, since in a 
lexical decision experiment for example, including both words and nonwords 
for analysis in the one .spc file means that the SD estimate is far higher 
than it would be for the words alone, or for the nonwords alone.  However, 
this procedure may not be appropriate for the calculation of the overall 
error rate.  Suppose we specify that only the words are to be analyzed in a 
lexical decision experiment.  One subject is unable to perform the task and 
responds "Yes" to every item.  His overall error rate will appear as 0%, 
not 50%.

         To guard against this, users may specify that the error rate to be 
used for deciding whether to include a subject or not should be based on 
all items, whether specified in the .spc file or not.  This is done by 
including the following line in the .spc file:

global_rejection

         Note:  this does not affect any other calculation.  Also, it only 
takes into account items that have a distinctive item number.  So, for 
example, if all the practice items are given the same item number, only one 
of them will enter into the calculation of the overall error rate.

         The new version may be obtained by downloading the dmdxutils.zip file.

We have four computers running windows XP pro on them. On 3 of them, I 
am able to use limited accounts to run DMDX, as long as I specify that the 
DMDX directory is read/write for limited accounts. On one of them, the 
first one we used DMDX on, I cannot use a limited account to run DMDX. 
When I run TimeDX as a limited user, I get an error saying that it cannot 
open/create SOFTWARE\TimeDX\2\Video_Driver. When I run DMDX, I get a 
similar error - DMDX can't open the registry key and asks me if I've 
run TimeDX. 
Those registry entries are there, and I can view them with Regedit, even 
as a limited user. When I make that limited user into an administrator, 
everything works fine - but I really don't want subjects logged in as 
administrators. Like I said, limited accounts work on three of the four 
computers; I just can't figure out what makes the computer different from 
the others.
The DMDX version is 2.9.01.

Any ideas?

   For a start I _really_ recommend 3.0.0.02 for XP, but that's not for any 
permissions issues it's to make sure the video modes get timed 
correctly.  On your permissions issue perhaps the difference between the 
machines comes from whether TimeDX was first run as Administrator or the 
limited account.  Perhaps on one machine the registry keys were created as 
Administrator and aren't readable as a result whereas the others were first 
run as the limited account so the keys are readable by all and sundry.  You 
can whack the TimeDX and DMDX registry forks with impunity (beyond have to 
run TimeDX again) to investigate the issue.

Hi,
Most of the speech files I play with dmdx begin with a short burst.
However, the one in the first trial never does.
A standard trial line looks like this (cross-modal priming):

+001  <wav 2>  "asw01x" /< ms% 100>/ * <ms% 4000>  "WORD";

When several speech files are opened on the same trial (e.g., auditory
A-X task), only the first one gets the pop sound at the onset.

Any idea what's happening? Thanks. nb: all speech files are recorded
with CoolEdit and they sound fine inside of CoolEdit.

Sven

Hi Sven,

 > Most of the speech files I play with dmdx begin with a short burst.
 > However, the one in the first trial never does.

I've had the same problem, not only with DMDX but also when using 
DirectSound from other programs. As far as I know it is a bug in 
DirectSound, the part of DirectX that DMDX uses to output sound. I was not 
able to solve it, but I've been told that ending all your soundfiles with a 
few mSecs of silence helps. Apparently, if a soundfile ends too abruptly 
the soundcard ends up in a 'unfinished' state and the next file will start 
with this artefact. I haven't tried this solution myself, so I don't know 
if it really works.

In my case it turned out that our labmachines are not showing this burst 
problem, only my desktop machine does, so it wasn't a real problem for me. 
This indicates that the problem doesn't happen with all soundcards.

Hope this helps,

Maarten

Hi Maarten,
Thanks for your advice. I added 10 ms, and it still didn't work. I then
tried 100 ms, and it worked. In the particular experiment I'm running ,
it is not a problem, but it will not always be.
Yes, all my files end abruptly--the primes are chopped-off words. And
yes, again, the problem only happens on my office machine, not on my lab
computers... I've heard that it might, as you suggested, be the sound
card. I'll try that too, but in the meantime I'll just use the silent
padding technique. Sven

   Or hunt down some later drivers for the sound card.

Hi Jonathan,

We just did some simple timing tests here to see how DMDX 3.0 is behaving 
itself with the Keithley PIO card in Win2000. The timing values it produces 
seem to be OK, but there is something we find difficult to explain.

We are sending pulses to Bit0 and Bit1 every 500 ms, and each pulse is 50 
ms wide. The pulse at Bit0 is about 200 ms delayed compared to Bit1, so we 
are actually sending a pulse to Bit1 and Bit2 alternatingly, with no 
overlap in time.

Strangely enough, the zil output file reports -Bit1 when Bit0 switches off, 
and -Bit0 when Bit1 switches off. The '+' events are all correct, and all 
times seem to be measured with ms precision.

Can you explain this?

Thanks,

Maarten

   No, there's almost no way beyond resorting to cosmic rays for 
explanations that the code could be doing that.  It's a loop that shifts 
though the bits of input and within that loop it decides if the button is 
pressed or released.  You're sure your test jig is providing 50ms duration 
pulses?

Hi Jonathan,

Yes, absolutely sure. We had both signals on a scope all the time. Also we 
tried the setup with another experimentation program, that also uses the 
Keithley PIO card, and that program produced output that agreed with the 
scope (but not before I had removed a bug from it, I have to admit...)

All pulses were reported by DMDX, and with correct timing. The only thing 
wrong was that -Bit1 and -Bit0 were the wrong way around.

   Well the code that processes PIO data is the same for all PIO devices 
unless of course you were using QPIO12 for the Keithley and PIO12 for the 
Metrabyte, that's different code.  Are you using the QPIO12 in both instances?

   Short answer is no, I can't see any way for DMDX to do what you 
report.  I will have to look at it later.

   Like I said, bzzt.  I read your email as if you had both the Computer 
Boards and Keithley cards and it wasn't until some time later that I 
thought about how you would have gotten both and then I re-read it and 
realized my error.

   Your problem is that you are using positive logic, DMDX expects negative 
logic, 0V == button pressed.  I meant to ask this question but forgot about 
it, sorry.  My bet is that you will see the same effects regardless of what 
version of DMDX and input device is used.

Sorry, I forgot to tell you: I had all signals inversed in the graph I send 
you, because it makes it easier for me to see what is going on. The input 
going from 'off' to 'on' is indeed the voltage going from 5V (or something 
like that) to 0V.

First, a bit of background about the way our lab works that may help 
figure out the problem. 

We have a computer running Linux that serves, via SMB, a mount to the 
Windows/DOS machines on which we run experiments (some with DMDX). DMDX 
RTF files for an experiment are kept in a directory on this mount, 
depending on the particular experiment. So I use 4 different RTF files for 
four different subjects, but they reside on this mount in the same 
directory.

DMDX, however, is installed locally on every computer. To run a script 
file, I browse to the SMB mount (say, Z:) and select the 
script file and run it. I do not copy it to the local harddrive.

I was running four subjects at a time today, and when they start at the 
same time, some of the DMDXs (3/4 the first time, 2/4 the second time) sit 
for a long time, then say something to the effect of "Cannot find 
rtfparsed file". I then exited DMDX, then reloaded it, and ran the scripts 
again. They ran right away. I cannot figure out why DMDX did this. Does it 
have to do with running from the same directory on the mount (ie DMDX is 
trying to create temp files or something on the mount, and four are trying 
all at once)?

Also, one of the subjects reported that DMDX aborted. I looked at the last 
line it tried to execute, and sure enough, there was an error. But I 
looked at the RTF file, and the lines differed. The line which DMDX was 
running was not in the original RTF.

I have zipped up the rtf file, the job1.zil file that I found in the 
directory which appears to be related, and the diagnostic.txt file (I 
know the ms timing errors are there - I'm not concerned with RT in this 
experiment). The last item that ran was 1116, I believe - notice the difference between 
that line in the diagnostic.txt and in the mr13cs4.rtf (the original rtf) 
file. What could cause this? Are there any other files which would help?

These files can be found at http://bengal.missouri.edu/~moreyr/mr13cs4.zip 


Thanks in advance for your help.

   You can't run DMDX that way, the temporary file names it uses will 
conflict.  You will have to have separate folders on the server for each

Would it be possible to have DMDX use random temp file names, or
something of that sort? Perhaps based on the machine name, the time and
the date?

hi there everybody,

i was just wondering if any of you have ever succeeded in creating a 
self-paced experiment using digital video as stimuli. basically, i just need 
to know if it's possible for participants to interrupt the digital video 
playback. is there some way of getting DMDX to go on to the next trial 
whenever a response is made? hope someone can maybe point me in the right 
direction...

many thanks,

   Hmm, I added an abort key for digital video sequences, dunno how well it 
would work bound to a response key as well:

   While I can't test the Keithley card under 2k or XP because the Keithey 
card merely being present in my XP machine stops the machine from even 
POSTing (let alone booting any OS) testing it in the ME box fails to 
duplicate the behavior you experienced.  When the request is pressed +bit0 
is followed by -bit0 and when negative button is pressed +bit1 is followed 
by - bit1.  Just to be sure I ripped the Keithley out of the ME machine and 
stuck it in our test bed and after a hour or so of setting up drivers and 
what not (old ATI cards are pigs and don't get me started on the Keithley 
driver configuration idiocy) I got the same results there under XP.  So 
unless your test jig is not doing what you think it is (I just used 
buttons) you've got some inexplicable error that I can't replicate here.

   And belive me, that .ZIL file you sent sure looks you're sending DMDX 
positive logic and not the negative logic it expects, your sequence starts 
with -bit1, if it was negative logic you'd see a +bit1 first.  Once you 
read the .ZIL file that way it all looks like it works, each button press 
sequence is - followed by + (and not + followed by -).  There's even 
approximately 50ms between your events:

You are right. We didn't interpret the zil output in the right way, and 
used negative logic. A stupid mistake. Sorry about that.

Looking at the output in the right way, it indeed seems to be working perfect.

Thanks,

hi there everyone,

thanks a million for the tip Jonathan! binding an abort key to a response key 
works perfectly. there's just one minor problem. our experimental design 
involves 4 valid responses (i.e. 4 separate response keys). binding an abort 
key to one of them is no problem, but when i try to bind it to two or more, 
dmdx only recognises one of them, specifically the last-placed one in the 
parameter line.

i was just wondering if it's possible to bind an abort key to more than one 
key, or is this a limitation of the <aikn text> keyword? It's not a major 
problem either way, because we can probably work around it. It'd just be 
really nice if somone had figured out a way to do it....

many thanks,

   There's no way around it without significantly expanding the code that 
implements the abort key.

There are two ways to write error-free programs.  Only the third one

Hi
I wonder if someone can advise whether DMDX has the facility to use =

I am wanting to rate perceptions of pictures and would like to record =

Maybe there is some other  software that can do this ?

 Being new to dmdx, it has taken me ages to get my first program running as
the user wants (but I'm told that's normal !)
Although I've looked intensively at the help files, I can't however find
much explanation as to the format of the output file (.zil).

 In particular:
 1. why is the output for each item on 2 lines ?
 2. why does the subject response time appear on both lines ?

 an example of the output I get looks like this:

Item 8, 1762.68
 1762.68,+Button 0
Item 111, 654.98
 654.98,+Button 1

 This all makes it much harder to analyse the results in a spreadsheet as
you first have to combine the lines !

 A point to note:  I have nowhere seen mentioned the fact that since dmdx
can be set to 'ignore unknown rtf' it is possible to create the program in a
Word document table, using for example column 1 for the item number, col 2
for specific commands, etc. In this way the text of each item can be
isolated in a single column. This allows my (technophobic) user to modify
the text as much as he likes, without accidentally upsetting the commands.
Having discovered this I also now find it 10 times easier to set up new dmdx
programs as I can use 'find and replace' on each column to modify olny the
bits I want to change...

   Normally it doesn't provide the RT on the first line, the second line is 
the raw switch closure data and normally there's more than one event per 
item, zil standing for "zillions".  Like this:


Subjects incorporated to date: 001
Data file started on machine PC125

**********************************************************************

>  2. why does the subject response time appear on both lines ?

   Because <zor> makes zil output look at little more like regular output 
that's analyzed for correctness.  If I could remember the reason why DMDX 
doesn't always provide both the RT with correctness calculated I'd make it 
always do it but the fact that it doesn't means there's something subtle in 
there that I'm not remembering and I don't particularly want to bust 
something unless I can avoid it.

   When zil was first created something like 10 years ago the data was 
always processed by filters I wrote.  Nowadays with speadsheets in wide use 
a tab delimited form of it's output on one line probably makes more sense 
-- but it won't happen unless someone decides to sponsor it's addition.

Hi,

I am trying to set up a file such that it goes through all the items, and
then re-presents the items (if possible, in a random order) that were
answered incorrectly. Importantly, I want this representation loop to
continue until there are no incorrect items remaining. I have been trying to
use counters and branches, however, I can't find a good way of repeating
items more than once. The script below appears to do what I want (without
scrambling) but I can't think of a clever way to get out of the
re-presentation loop.

0 <set 1,0><set 2,0><bu 1000>c;

200 c<bicLE 1,0,210>;
0 c<set 1,0>;
+100 "target1-again"*<inciw 1>c;
210 c<bicLE 2,0,220>;
0 c<set 2,0>;
+101 "target2-again"*<inciw 2>c;
220 <bu -200>c;

1000 "Are you ready to begin?";
+100 "target1"*<inciw 1>c;
+101 "target2"*<inciw 2>c;
102 <bu -200>c;
0 "the end";


If anyone can help it would be much appreciated?
Thanks
- Adam

Problem:  DMDX runs in "white screen mode", command line display not visible.  "-display 1" argument has no effect.

* DMDX 3.0.0.01
* single monitor / graphics card
* (only) one video driver detected
* Windows 98
* simple DMDX script:  plays some .wav files, no subject interaction, no subject display.


P.S.
1)  I had a problem with a Keithley PIO-12 driverLINX pop up window a few weeks ago -- solved the problem by simply uninstalling the Keithley programs.

2)  Anyone running DMDX under a foreign language version of Windows should be aware of the fact that you will have to use the native (non-english) names for the mouse and keyboard devices when using the <InputDevice ...> function.  E.g., to use a mouse in Swedish:  <ID mus> or in Australia <ID cheeky_rodent>.   The native names are visible in the TimeDX  "Basic Tests" --> "Input Test".  (although the input test also lists my Nokia Monitor's inbuilt USB hub as an input device).

   The best way to do this is to have a counter for every item and to only 
execute an item if that counter is zero and once a correct response had 
been given to increment that counter.  To fully implement your solution you 
would need two item files and each item would have to increment two 
counters dependant on the response given.  The first item file would 
basically set all counters to zero, save them and then chain to the second 
item file.  The second item file would scramble and contain the experiment 
proper.  It would load all counters, and set a global counter to zero that 
will be used to determine if there were any incorrect responses.  Each item 
will have to have a skip display item before it and two skip display items 
after it, the first skip item before would branch to the last one if the 
item's counter wasn't zero (because it's response has been correct), the 
item would follow, the first following skip item would increment the item's 
counter if the response was correct and increment the global counter if the 
response was wrong.  The last following skip item is just a destination 
stub, nothing but <sd> and item number and a semi colon.  At the end of the 
second item file if the global counter isn't zero there must have been at 
least one wrong response so it will save counters and chain to itself so 
it'll get scrambled again and all wrong items can get presented again.

I have also had problems with unwanted triggers, but not in the same way as 
others have described.  Here is my script:

$
0 "Thanks for your help!";
$

The written words appearing before the BMP are all primes for the picture 
which is the target whose RT I want to measure.  In my case, a normal 
reaction time is recorded for about half the items, while for the other 
half, a RT of between 1-150 is registered.  In fact, most of the time a 
correct RT alternates every other test item with an RT indicating a false 
trigger.  I have tinkered with the VOX settings, the enhanced window time, 
etc. to no avail.  I feel that ambient noise is not the problem either.  I 
have also taken Dr. Hecht's advice and inserted <t 1200> before the clock 
'*', with the same results.

If I run the test with the microphone unplugged, or plugged in sitting on 
the desk, all of the items show the expected 1200 ms timeout.  It is also 
possible that the response to the last prime was still being pronounced 
when the target was presented, which could account for the false triggers, 
so I tried responding only to the BMP target, with the same results--about 
every other RT is a false trigger. I have also preamped the microphone and 
run it through the input channel, rather than the microphone channel of the 
sound card with the same results.

I am running a Pentium IV, Windows 2000, and have a Creative Sound Blaster 
Live! Value sound card.

If this problem with digital vox cannot be resolved, I would have no 
problem using an external VOX.  I would appreciate it if someone could 
provide a sample script and instructions on how to do this through DMDX.

Your help is appreciated in advance,

   No that's a new one.  My guess is that the hardware profile that enables 
the network also disables the display adapter or some part of it.  What OS 
are you using?

   You'll have to figure out what display adapter is in the machine and 
find some new display drivers for it.

   Hmm, sounds familiar but the last time we did anything with the VOX was 
eons ago so it's going to take me a while to remember what the problem 
was.  Unless you're using a positively ancient version of DMDX it's not 
likely that there's an error in the code.  IIRC I think the problem was 
resolved using the enhanced features of the vox and sampling energy over a 
number of milliseconds.  Otherwise you can try using the RecordVocal device 
as well as DigitalVOX, it'll make DMDX record the utterance for whatever 
the timeout's duration is so it'll force slow pacing (and of course eat up 
gobs of hard disk space).

Jonathan,

Thanks for the advice.  I installed updated drivers and the false triggers 
disappeared.

   Hmm, haven't played with profiles at all under 2k, it's entirely 
possible that you're able to control drivers with profiles.  So the dial up 
profile has good video drivers and the network profile has shoddy 
ones.  You might check the version of the display driver in the device 
manager with each profile.  If they're both the same I'm wrong and have to 
think of another explanation.

Hello all !

Here in the departement we are trying to run DMDX experiments while
getting fMRI scans. For some technical reasons that are too long to
explain we were trying to run dmdx experiments on a laptop. Our problem
is that we are having trouble getting the TTL signals sent by the
scanner on the laptop. Is there any way that PIO12 cards or any other
valid device is pluged into a laptop? The laptop is a rather recent Dell
Lattitude, it does not have a joystick port , but it has a parallell usb
and pcmcia ports where cards might be adaptable.


Thanks to all for your help


Ps Matt davis' pages on the topic at
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/~matt.davis/fmri_dmdx.html are great,
thanks for puting that on the www!

I'm posting this on behalf of Jennifer Venditti jjv@cs.columbia.edu
            --k.i.f.
 
 
Hello,
 
I need to set up two PCs so that the presentation PC (running DMDX)
communicates with a PC which is recording eye movements (using the ISCAN
system). ISCAN only allows input from a serial port to be recorded in
their output file. Is there any way to get DMDX to send a serial signal
through a null modem cable to the ISCAN PC? The signal should be an
integer (0-255, marking the item number), and should be synchronized
with the onset of a sound file associated with the particular item. I've
searched through the list archive and help pages, but haven't found the
answer yet. Or maybe I'm looking at the wrong pages?
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks!
Jennifer Venditti

   No.  Not unless you want to sponsor a modification.

   No amount of document reading would help you I'm afraid.  Not sure how 
serial devices are handled under win32 (never looked), they used to be file 
streams which means I wouldn't want to bank on their timing, maybe there's 
a low level interface lurking in there.

This is probably more of a warning than (another) cry for help,
but, I still cannot get my old DEC Venturis 575 PC with its S3 TRIO 32/64 PCI video card to display the command display (or anything else) while DMDX is running an item file.  The driver is the latest that Windows 98/Microsoft recognizes and the beast is running with DirectX 8.1

Thanks,

Derek

   Then try another video card.  Your wording is odd, one would not 
normally be able to see DMDX's command display while it is running, one 
would normally only see the subject's display unless you had two display 
devices.  If you do have two display devices be advised that not all video 
card combinations are going to work, a number of drivers refuse to work 
with other drivers.  The DMDX updates page has some information of multiple 
monitor setups and a link to a database of card combinations that work.

   I'm not aware of a tutorial on how you would use branching, I just 
provide the details and rely on people's knowledge of branching to see them 
through:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhbranchkeyword.htm

   You could look at the demo I guess, it's got some branching in it.

   Check the Updates page:

http://www.u.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx.htm


   I went back to the archives to read your info more carefully and from 
that I gather that you mean DMDX never even displays the initial dialog 
whereas TimeDX does?  You can't ever tell it to run an item file?  If 
that's the case DMDX may be having issues with some other aspect of the 
machine and is hanging when it tries to run.  Sky's the limit there, never 
even heard of similar behavior let alone experienced it.

Hie everybody!
I would like to suscribe to your list. My name is Caroline Petit. There is
something else I'd like to know: this is the kind of joysticks I have to buy
because I realised that the last ones called "wingman logitech game pad ..."
are no more sold. I need to have the precise type of the new feeback joysticks
. Please send me all the necessary references to buy them.If anybody has aby
idea about these new references, tell me. Thanks for your precious help.
Caroline Petit.
P.S: since I haven't any mailbox yet, it is the name of one of my friend,
Leonid, which will appear on the message and on the e-mail adress. Bye.
Caroline.

   As part of the version 3 upgrade of DMDX it now has an installer.  This 
of course increases the size of the archive by a factor of 6, but hey, 
that's MS for ya.  By default it will install to \ Program Files \ DMDX and 
add a number of shortcuts to the start menu under Programs \ DMDX.  To 
update future versions the older version will need to be uninstalled, I 
didn't see any kind of intelligent behavior when I updated DMDX's version 
number.  For the 6X larger download we get an entry in Add Remove Programs 
and the registry will be purged of any DMDX keys -- I guess people using 
multiple versions of DMDX will have to extract the executables and not use 
the installer (which might be entertaining, I don't offhand know of 
anything that opens .MSI files).  DMDX has been changed to facilitate the 
short comings in the MS installer, specifically it will always use the 
directory that has DMDX.EXE in it for it's temporary files, 
diagnostics.txt, rtfparsed.txt and so forth (although there would appear to 
be some circumstances that will leave them in the directory that the item 
file is in).  Users of GeForce video cards will want to use the special 
shortcut in Programs / DMDX and not the shortcut placed on the desktop.

   Next up kiss goodbye to .HLP files and say hello to .CHMs (compiled HTML).

in TimeDx causes a crash).

   I take it you're using an ancient version of DMDX?  It shouldn't be 
possible to access the refresh rate increasing code under 2k or XP with any 
recent version.  The latest version of TimeDX when running under 2k or XP 
will also actually enumerate all possible refresh rates so trial end error 
is at least eliminated.

   Multiple options there.  If you don't want to start swapping out 
hardware it's possible that your refresh rates might get unlocked by one of 
the refresh rate unlocking programs around the place like RefreshLock, but 
the fact that you've got 75Hz already doesn't make me think that's a likely 
explanation:

http://www.pagehosting.co.uk/rl/

   Although reading the front page of RefreshLock it would indicate that 
75Hz has somehow become a possible default refresh rate so my guess is that 
RefreshLock is as far as you'll have to go.

   Otherwise it's possible that the lower video modes will operate at a 
higher refresh rate as things stand, the TNT2 is a little aged but should 
be capable of handling refresh rates well over 75Hz for things like 
640x480x16.  If not it's likely that the monitor is the limiting factor, 
mine will operate at 150Hz if not 200Hz (not that I think the TNT2 will 
allow 200Hz).  So if you've got another monitor try it, if rates are still 
limited try a later video card.

Hello everyone,

Here is a new user of DMDX. I am now trying to measure real-time 
response (reaction time) to animation, but I find it really hard to achieve. I 
wonder if this can be done by incorporating flash file in DMDX. Is there 
anyone who has tried doing similar things and is kind enough to teach 
me to do so? Thanks very much for your kind attention.

Best,
Ice

   No, you can't use Flash files, nor is it likely that will you ever be 
able to.  Assuming you animation sequences are complicated enough to not 
lend themselves to DMDX's scripting your only choice is to use the Digital 
Video capabilities, playing .MPGs or .AVIs or whatever else your machine 
has codecs installed for.  There's a the chapter in the help and digital 
video demo (on the updates page).  If you can find some way to get Flash 
animations rendered to a file then you can use Flash.

After the 1or 9 response I want to get back to the main program =

   I take it you mean that both the 1 and the 9 key will be pressed?

   As long as the shift keys are bound to the correct and incorrect 
responses (with the map keywords <mpr> and <mnr>) <zil> will scan through 
keys pressed and decide the correctness of a response based on the last 
valid key pressed.  Then you can ise <bic> or <cic> and so forth.  You'll 
probably also want to validate all the keys with <vzk>.  You can map and 
unmap keys through the item file which is usually what I wind up doing 
around here to solve similar paradigms, so for the first item all keys are 
unmapped (from the previous item) and then the shift keys are mapped and 
then for the second item all keys get unmapped again and then 1 and 9 get 
mapped.

   Using a subroutine will certainly shrink the size of your item file.

   You wanna try documenting it, writing it is easy, explaining what's 
possible is impossible.

   She has been unsubscribed.  I wasn't doing it because Ken said he wanted 
to do that kind of stuff but patently he's either not around or hasn't done 
it so I preempted him.

(it is Sunday afternoon;  I came to my office to do some real work, but instead, I can't resist wondering in public ....)

Could DMDX possibly run under Linux using the "Windows emulator" WINE?

The "games people" seem to have Windows DirectX 8.0 based games  running (e.g., see:  http://www.transgaming.com/news.php?newsid=25 )

"TransGaming is actively developing improvements to the Wine project to achieve full compatibility with the Microsoft DirectX APIs without sacrificing any performance. Wine is an implementation of the Microsoft Win32 APIs on top of UNIX and X-Windows; in essence, it is a Windows compatibility layer. Wine is an Open Source project, and has a web site of its own at www.winehq.com. It does not require Microsoft Windows to be installed."

   Well if the timing is any good it will be a minor miracle.  Not only 
must DirectX function (and  DMDX uses DirectX in an odd enough fashion to 
find holes in almost all drivers, however there's always -buffers 2) but 
the kernal multimedia callbacks must function as they do under win32 
alone.  You'll have to pay pretty careful attention to the TimeDX 
millisecond tests that are usually overlooked.

I am using Russian Windows 98 and, DirectX 8.1. The following has happened

1) When trying to run the demo experiment vis1, I got an error 
message regarding the inability of DMDX to find the input device.
2) I checked recent the archives of this list and found that someone 
else had this problem recently.
3) I followed the suggestion, entering <id russian-word-for-keyboard>
4) That fixed that problem.
5) DMDX would now reach the point in the experiment where a response 
was required on the keyboard (a spacebar press).
6) The response (spacebar press) had no effect.
7) I added the mapping definition <mr russian-word-for-spacebar> 
(using the russian word shown in the input device test in TimeDX)
8) I next got an error message that no such button could be found

I hope there is a simple answer.

Hi I have had a program working that branches depending on a correct or
incorrect answer..then a further decisional response is required   which
then branches back to the main program.   My problem is that my main prog
and branching prog are becoming corrupted when scrambling.  I know there is
some literature/warning using backward branching and scrambling, however I
would be grateful for some advice on this....Frequently , rather than
displaying the first bmp file in the sequence ,,,the first branch
instruction prompts the second decisional string. This should only happen
after the first instruction. However it bypasses the main string and starts
with a branch instruction

Some more hints for Digital Vox:

1) use <id RecordDigital> as well - that way if the voice key should 
misbehave or the subjects voice gets progressively quieter you have a 
record of their responses to use for off-line analysis

2) set a short time-out (e.g. 2000ms) - DMDX will record for as long as the 
time-out so you don't want this to be too long unless disk-space is an 
infinite resource for you.

3) make sure that you specify a subject ID for each volunteer. Otherwise 
you may end up overwriting speech files. Starting and ending your ID with a 
. (for example using the ID ".matt.") can also be useful since it makes 
file management easier.

Good luck,

Matt

Did that, too. (Otherwise it won't even report the name of the key it 
can't find.)

   You've to the <mr> keyword after the <id> keyword?  Beyond a simple 
mis-typing I can't think of much else.  There are a couple of screen 
capture utilities out there, if you could send me (not the list) a snapshot 
of the TimeDX keyboard test with the name of the key in question and the 
diagnostics.txt when you try and map that key in DMDX (which I hope has 
enough information in it) I can look at it in more detail.

Mike, some of the keyboard buttons have English names, such as "Del", 
and I've tried <mr "Del">, and that doesn't work either. I don't 
think there would be a transliteration problem in such a case.

   Well it looks like we'll be getting variable RecordVocal lengths 
courtesy of the none-to-generous folks at Harvard.  Don't have an ETA, 
that's damned complicated code.

   Looks like my concerns over the list serve threader were misplaced, the 
missing posts were indeed there, they were correctly linked as replies to a 
Dec 2001 post that was used as the seed for the original post and the 
couple of dropped posts were because I edited out that chain letter a while 
back but left the archive owned by root and not petidomo (oops) and the 
post that's filed under No Date In Message does in fact have no Date (or 
Subject or From) field so the threader's doing the right thing.

Subject: [DMDX] How to display text and sounds together?
Reply-To: DMDX@psy1.psych.arizona.edu

Hello everybody,

This is a letter from China. 
I'm using DMDX to  create a experiment, but I encounter a problem that I can't solve it by myself. So I need your help, Thank you.

I want to display a "+" in the begin of a item, and then two sounds play individually. I especially want the "+" to be able to stay on the screen when the two sounds are playing. But now I can only display "+" for only one second(or two seconds), and then the "+" DISPEARED when the two sounds begin to play.
 How can I display the "+" for all the time when the two sounds are playing? Please tell me the answer, thank you very much.


Yours sincerely

G.M. Wang

Hello everyone,

This is a letter from China. 
I'm using DMDX to set up an experiment about display the text and sound, But I encounter a  problem that I can't solve it by myself. 
The problem is that I build a item file like below, all thing to be fine. But when I run it with DMDX, It only display the first "Welcome to this program", then it  can't go on even I press the space button and other keys.

Why it didn't go on anyway? Please tell me the answer, Thank you very much!

     (no branch)??




The question is that when scrambling the scramble initiates the early demise
of the program. That is the scrambling prematurely terminates before the
every instruction is executed...??

I want to ultimately scramble and complete after I I have completed all
instructions

Hope it akes sense

thanks Arch

Hallo Wang,

I think I have had a similar problem. Let me describe it briefly: I run 
the features.rtf file that comes in the demo.zip folder you get when you 
download DMDX. The program went through the instructions and as soon as 
it arrived at the first stimulus item the computer froze completely: not 
even pressing ctrl alt del helped.

I looked at the archived messages and I found that that happens if you 
have a certain video card (a GeForce I think). I would refer you to the 
List server thread, but when I try to search it now I get an internal 
error message.

Anyway, you might want to try and start your program from the command 
line with this command: "dmdx.exe -buffers 4". In my case it worked.

hope this helps,

     If it's not the GeForce issue are there messages about not being able 
to find the "keyboard" device in the diagnostics.txt after you abort with 
ESC?  If you can abort with ESC it's not the GeForce issue as that locks 
the machine up solidly.  DMDX has trouble with International versions of 
Windows where the input devices has been a different name (I'll be writing 
a help topic on it shortly).  Check the TimeDX Input Device test and help, 
you probably need <id "chinese-name-for-keyboard"> and <mr 
"chinese-name-for-space-bar"> and so on.

   BTW, unless you are changing input keys you don't need to <umb> and 
<mpr> every item and feedback sticks too, no need for <wfb> every item either.

   Hmm.  What is it that you want the item file to do?  Looks like you got 
some straight forward branching design issues.

Simply want the prog to make to make a second decisional response after one
of the initial keys have been pressed

Say, first response would be yes
if yes that the second response (y or n) needs to be recorded.

My Prob is I want to show all the pics (scrambled)
I find my current set up terminating prematurely
hope that makes sense


I am hung up on something  (as is my prog).I have overlooked something for
sure And it is probable a basic branching prob ...but I can't see it at
present

sorry  arch

Thank you, Ruben van de Vijver!

    I've try your methed--"dmdx.exe -buffers 4", But I'm sorry to say it doesn't work in my case. And I also try another buffers but it still doesn't work. And I'm not clear what's mean to do this.
    My display card is "Trident Blade 3D PCI/AGP", not the Geforce card. So I think It's not because of this reasone.
 Thank you for your help anyway.

Hello Mr Forster,

The following file is part of my control file. I paste it here so that you can see it more clearly.
My display card is "trident Blade 3D PCI/AGP", not the Geforce card, and when the program stops, I can Press ESC to abort it. So the reasonse is not display card.

I've been trying for a few days to send a message to this list, and 
I'm repeatedly told either that the SMTP server won't relay mail to 
psy1.psych.arizona.edu or that it cannot find such an address. This 
test is to determine whether the jpegs attached to that message are 
at fault, that is, if a simple, brief message will get through.

   So the item file stops here and won't proceed?  And the Chinese keyboard 
has a key called "Space"?  Because DMDX is waiting for the "Space" key to 
be pressed.

   I did say to not send the mail to the list, I said send it to me: 
<jforster@psy1.psych.arizona.edu>.  And, yes, it's probably the attachments 
that are stopping it but they shouldn't be.  You might try sticking them in 
a .zip instead.

Hello Mr Joster,

You said the right thing that When the program runs, It will stop at the "Welcome to this program", and I can press ESC to abort. 
Besides, When I run the timeDX--Basic Test--Input Test, I can see clearly that the space button is used, and when I change the request button I meet the same problem also.  when I "Syntx Check" the itme file, It doesn't tell me that the space button can't be used. 
So I think it's not because of the button. But Why DMDX can't go on? I'm so confused, please tell me the answer.
Thank you.

   It's a mystery to me.  Sounds like the same problem the guy in Russia is 
having.  Beyond removing the quotes in <mr "+Space"> so it becomes <mr 
+Space> you'll have to wait till next week when I cook up a special 
diagnostics mode to get to the root of this issue.  I suggest removing the 
quotes because they're only really necessary when there's a space in the 
name of the key (and in the case of mapping key names they might not even 
be necessary then, I'd have to closely look at the code) and when the 
quotes are present all sorts of RTF text formatting issues arise (they 
should be parsed out, but hey, I'm human).

   My guess is it can't go on because it never gets a request because the 
mapping of the space bar to the request is not working.  Somehow.

   You need the latest display drivers.  If Toshiba doesn't supply any 
you'll have to find out what chipset is used for it's video and get the 
manufacturer's reference drivers.

DMDX 3.0.0.05 is released, it includes the new .CHM help file and a new 
test mode for Input Device button monitoring.  With TestMode 10 active any 
new input devices will list all their buttons in the diagnostics (both on 
screen and in diagnostics.txt), any button mappings in the item file will 
be listed and as buttons are pressed their names will be listed.  Along 
with the human readable name the decimal values of each character in the 
button name are listed to facilitate any weird font issues.

   So is the disk full?  Maybe DMDX doesn't have write privilege (happens 
with NTFS pretty easily, almost impossible with 9X).  Perhaps Scandisk 
needs to be run because the machines's file system is not integral (ie it's 
busted and needs to be fixed).

>2)  Another is pixel incompatibility  when setting up on another laptop.

   Old laptops and their display drivers are terrible.  Perhaps you'll have 
to limit display modes to 256 colors on older machines.

Hello, Mr Forster,

Thank you for your advice very much!
I've solved this problem with a hard work under your advice.
Yes, DMDX did wait for a request, because I write the control words inappropriately. I wrote "<mr +Space><umb>", this is wrong of course. I just write <umb><mr +space>, the problem is solved.
Thank you very much!

   There's a new version 3.0.05 of TimeDX on the web site that has a small 
change to the Input Test that provides the binary ID of keys as well as 
their name.  This is pursuant to building a fail safe keyboard input device 
in DMDX that doesn't care what language has been used to describe the 
keyboard.  But before I do it I need to know whether the binary IDs for the 
keys DMDX would use are in fact common across languages.  So on my US 
windows I see that:

#42 is the left shift key,
#54 is the right shift key and
#57 is the space bar.

   If people with international versions of windows would kindly install 
the latest software and report whether their keys have the same IDs I will 
proceed to build the new input device.

Is it possible to use a counter rather than a constant with the output
keyword <output N>?  I ask because we control a shock generator with the io
card and would like to be able to vary shock intensity (set with 8 bits of
the io card) based on task performance.  Therefore, we cannot hard code the
output values as constants but need to be able to adjust online during
execution of the script (which could be easily accomplished with counters,
etc).  Also, can counters accommodate the full 24bit range required if we
use the middle (B) and upper (A) ports of the PIO12Output24 device?

   No.  I've toyed with the idea of making any keyword that uses a single 
parameter be able to use a counter instead, but it's such a massive thing 
to do I can't predict the repercussions -- I'm sure there's something that 
will break but I haven't been able to think of it yet.  However your past 
donations to the DMDX cause will serve you in good stead here and I can 
make the output keyword use an optional counter instead.

   Counters are 32 bit entities so the 24 bits of output are no problem.

Dear j.c.f., ken and other experts,

I would be very grateful if you would be so kind as to assist me with
this problem that I suspect may reside in the parameter line.

I have written a task that presents a warning tone-a 400 ms wav
containing 200 msec of tone followed by 200 msec of silence-
concurrently with a bmp -which is a fixation cross. This fixation cross
is presented for 500 msec such that offset of wav and bmp synchronise-
and then a new bmp image is presented for an intended 1 second (86 frame
durations(0.011627907 s)). The idea is that either of two responses on a
button box then causes the next trial to begin and RT to the onset of
second BMP is written to azk without feedback.

For some reason the video mode results in the images being rather wider
than they were originally so I have used the bm command to resize them
to their original proportions.

Running DMDX with the diagnostic box checked permits everything to run
smoothly and no tick disorder is apparent. However, in practice when a
participant is doing the task, the task stop half way through. The
second BMP disappears and neither response causes the next trial to
begin.

I include the whole task in this circumstance as the problem can arise
on even the 280th of 285 trials.

Best regards,
Tom Campbell.

   No.  I've toyed with the idea of making any keyword that uses a single
parameter be able to use a counter instead, but it's such a massive thing
to do I can't predict the repercussions -- I'm sure there's something that
will break but I haven't been able to think of it yet.  However your past
donations to the DMDX cause will serve you in good stead here and I can
make the output keyword use an optional counter instead.

   Counters are 32 bit entities so the 24 bits of output are no problem.

Use <revertoutput> keyword in the header to run IOcard in non-latched mode.
The 5 indicates that output will revert to hold value after 5ms.  Set the
hold value (I use 255) to match hold value in the ns setup file.

Then simply use the <output> (or o) keyword in each item in the same frame
as you present the bmp file to mark the onset of the bmp presentation.

In the above example, using a refresh of 60hz, two slides (a negative and
positively valent slide) are presented for approx 6 s on a specific trial
and I mark the valence of the slide with the output code sent to the ns
physio file.  ISI of approx 2s

   Not that expect anyone to actually provide me with info but I'll ask 
anyway.  Has anyone been using RecordVocal under Windows 2000 or XP 
yet?  We've got some anomalous behavior from a machine down stairs that I 
would normally attribute to drivers but a laptop also throws error which 
makes me suspicious.  Basically something interrupts DMDX for hundreds of 
ticks and causes RecordVocal to toss and error about invalid parameters to 
the lock function.  Updating drivers on the machines which would be my 
normal response might be impossible because the drivers might not exist and 
rather than go to all the hassle of installing a known good audio device 
I'd like to know that someone has in fact got DirectSoundCatupre stuff 
(RecordVocal and DigitalVOX) functioning under 2k/XP.

I do care about the international keyboard.
I am running windows 98 and I haven't successed to present any text in
Korean. I make them all in image files. It was really pain. In the
keyboard control, I don't see the option for Korean keyboard. I know
Window XP has it. Are there any ways to display non romanized
character in DMDX?

Thank you so much.

   Windows 98 isn't much good for non-roman alphabets, a much better bet is 
to use 2000 or XP.

   Really?  How interesting.  My guess is that you must have "Keyboard" 
keyboard otherwise you'd be running into the issues others have been having 
with mapping buttons.

   Multiple people use it for Chinese and Hebrew fonts.  I don't know what 
they use to generate the .RTF files though.

   DMDX 3.0.0.07 is released.  Included are the new #inputdevices designed 
to allow DMDX to keep running even when the name of the keyboard isn't 
"keyboard" (assuming of course that button #57 is in fact the space bar on 
anything else besides the US keyboard but I can't tell not having any non 
US keyboards), a new alternate <vm> switch that doesn't require two 
vertical dimensions as in <vm 1024,768,16,0>), and an <o> keyword alternate 
that can now contain a counter reference.

Hi Heejong,
I have no problem using DMDX to present Chinese. Please try what I did in my programs.
(1) Check your computer using TimeDX to find out the symbols used in your computer to represent the "keyboard" and the keys on the keyboard.
(2) In the control line of the DMDX program, key in the word "keyboard" (in <id "keyboard">) in "Korean".
(3) In the program lines, "mapping response" (mr) should be added whenever keyboard responses are needed. See the following example.

0 <mr +Space> "Press Space........

Good luck with your experiment.

Chih-Wei

I do care about the international keyboard.
I am running windows 98 and I haven't successed to present any text in
Korean. I make them all in image files. It was really pain. In the
keyboard control, I don't see the option for Korean keyboard. I know
Window XP has it. Are there any ways to display non romanized
character in DMDX?

Thank you so much.

   Hopefully this kind of thing won't be necessary anymore unless people 
actually want to use keys other than the standard space bar / shift key 
group.  If fact, all <id> keywords and <mr> etc keywords should be removed 
(assuming today's DMDX has been installed of course) and then international 
keyboards should be fine.  Of course if people actually reported the number 
that the space bar and shift keys report with the latest versions of TimeDX 
as per my earlier posting like I asked I'd know if it was going to work...

Hi,

In an experiment I am about to run I would like to have the subject tell 
me whether two wav files are identical or not. Now, when these files are 
playing until the subject has given me his answer, I want to display a 
text telling him what button is correct and which button is incorrect. I 
know how to display the text for the duration of the two wav files, but 
not how to display the instruction text until he has reacted.

Any suggestions?

Hi,

I just tested the new dmdx version on a machin with a german keyboard:

#42 is indeed the left shift key (in German <Umschalttaste Links>)
#54 is indeed the right shift key (in German <Umschalttaste Rechts>)
#57 is indeed the spacebar (in German <Leertaste>)

I could send a screenshot of the test (not to the list I guess), if 
necessary?

best,

Dear John Curtin, j.c.f., ken and other experts,

Thanks for the suggestion. Please could you verify if 0 is not possible as a
line number? It would appear to be an interaction between using randomisation
and using the 0 as a line. Remove the randomisation using 0 as the line number
does not present a problem. It may be that the randomisation routines cannot use
0 as a tag to reorganise the order of trials. Replace 0 with 20 and the thing
seems to run smoothly. I hope it was that I was not just chance when I tested
the routine. This is the program rehashed slighlty but it seems to work:

<ep> s162 f146 <azk> <cr> <ntl> <fd  1> <t 500000> <d 43> <vm 640, 480,480, 16,
0> <id PIO12> <mpr +BUTTON1> <mnr +BUTTON2>
$<clfb> <dbc 0> <dwc 225225225> </ep>

   Much thanks, no screen shot is necessary, this is indeed the information 
I was looking for.  The international keyboard code will certainly work in

Hi,

We are trying to send triggers to neuroscan, we have run the program 
below but no triggers seem to arrive (although the program runs 
flawlessly). We have run another program, not using dmdx but (dos-based) 
erts instead, and then triggers do arrive.

Has anybody had similar experiences?

best,

ruben

Have you set the hold value correctly (to 255.  Default is 0 I believe) in
the Neuroscan set-up file?  Do you get any triggers?  You can use the
Neuroscan test hardware trigger port option to view the input to the trigger
port.

Hi,

We are trying to send triggers to neuroscan, we have run the program
below but no triggers seem to arrive (although the program runs
flawlessly). We have run another program, not using dmdx but (dos-based)
erts instead, and then triggers do arrive.

Has anybody had similar experiences?

best,

ruben

On a french keyboard:

#42 is indeed the left shift key 
#54 is indeed the right shift key
#57 is indeed the spacebar

Hi,

I was wondering if anyone is familiar with the error message "Cannot use 
rawjoystick device under NT/2k/XP".  I noticed in the help pages that it 
states "Rawjoystick is not available under NT & later (2k & XP)", but I am 
uncertain what this means.  Any help is muchly appreciated.

Thanks, 
Stephanie

   It means what it says, you can't use that device under the OS you're 
using (direct I/O is now illegal).  You'll have to use the DirectX Joystick 
device instead.

The system is a intel pentium 4. It is interesting that  when I run DMDX =
, use browse to load my program (BMP Files), select ,and then run the =
(Write to output file=20
failed  Disk Full) occurs. However  it I exit the DMDX and then open it =
up again, my programe runs OK with out fault. It seems that selecting my =
program and running it does not work . I need to exsit DMDX reload it =
and use run immediately . Hope this is clear

I have done this . The laptop is a Toshiba TE 2000 which should be more =
than adequate to handle graphics  files .   I have reinstalled Directx =
and tested it. Also the display settings seem OK .   As soon as I select =
the DMDX program or even Time DX, I find this (DDERR pixel =
incompatability message) appears.  =20

   If you have NTFS for a file system (under windows 2000 or XP) then 
perhaps you've got the privileges set weirdly.  What version of DMDX are we 
talking about?  There is a slight difference between running DMDX without 
browsing to a new file, the current working directory probably moves so 
temporary files might get written to different locations.  Check the 
security settings on both the directory that contains DMDX.EXE and the 
directory that contains your item files.

   So it's busted.  You could hunt up reference drivers from Trident or 
whatever the company is that makes the Trident chips.  Unless you want to 
try using other video modes there's nothing else I can suggest other than 
using another computer.

Hello all

I have been trying to program a picture naming experiment with the
following characteristics:

I want a fixation point, the picture, the picture disappears when the
subject responds (recordvocal and digitalvox inputs) and then a question
mark blocks the experiment until the space bar is pressed.

That's easy, what is difficult is to have a permanent white square, the
size of the pictures, at the screen location where the pictures appear.
In other words, throughout the experiment there is a medium sized white
screen on the center on the screen, with black around it and the stimuli
appear on that square.

This is difficult to program because making disappear the picture when
the subject response is detected (which is a must) does not disappear
the content but simply cleans the screen. This means that the screen
goes back to its background color: in principle black.

Black background color is disareable because white backgrounds tend to
give headaches, because they are very luminous.

A consequence of all this is that the program makes the white square
appear and disappear (it is tied to the stimuli presentation)


I have found one way to go around that, the following program does it,
although ONLY on my laptop. The trick is to use a very low resolution
video mode (which in the laptop results in DMDX using only a fraction of
the screen) and a white background color. The screen fraction then IS
the small white square I am after. The problem is that the trick doesn't
work on regular screens (i.e., desktop PC's). There , choosing a very
low resolution video mode results in DMDX using the whole screen..; at a
low resolution.

I wonder if anyone out there has addressed such a specific problem, but
I'll be happy to read about "presenting stimuli that remain visible
throughout an experiment"

Cheers

Xavier

   You want to use the comma frame separator that merges two displays as if 
they were one, all displays should be merged with the white 
square.  Feedback also has a an only clear behind it option:

I USE CAPS FOR READABILITY

YES BUT EVEN IF THE DISPLAYS ARE MERGED WITH THE WHITE SQUARE, WHEN THE
SUBJECT'S RESPONSE IS GIVEN, THE DISPLAY IS CLEARED (SINCE I AM USING
THE CLEARFEEDBACK KEYWORD: THIS IS BECAUSE I WANT THE DISAPPEARENCE OF
THE PICTURE, NOT OF THE SQUARE, TO BE TIED TO THE SUBJECT'S RESPONSE);

IF I SPECIFY 'ONLY CLEAR BEHIND', WELL THAT STILL CLEARS PART OF THE
SQUARE. I HAVE FOUND NO WAY OF CLEARING THE PICTURE BMP WHILE LEAVING ON
A BLANCK WHITE SQUARE BMP. 

I SUPPOSE ONE WAY TO DO THIS IS BY SPECIFYING THAT THE FEEDBACK IS NOT
TEXT, BUT THE WHITE BLANCK SQUARE(A BMP FILE) SO THAT IT SHOWS UP RIGHT
AFTER THE RESPONSE, IS THAT POSSIBLE?


ANOTHER WAY I HAVE FOUND IS TO USE THE FOLLOWING SCRIPT, WHICH PLAYS
WITH VARIANTS OF FEEDBACK TO ENSURE A CONTINUITY OF DISPLAY ON THE
SCREEN (PRESS SPACEBAR TO GO FROM ONE TRIAL TO ANOTHER, VERBAL RESPONSE
TO THE PICTURE STIMULI)

<bmp> "fixation.bmp" / *<BMP> "Fill-A-Comb.BMP";


THIS SCRIPT HAS TWO PROBLEMS, HOWEVER:
1/THE DIGITAL VOX AND KEYBOARD INPUTS HAVE SOME WEIRD INTERACTION SUCH
THAT AS SOON AS YOU USE DIGITAL VOX, IT TRIGGERS ALL THE FOLLOWING ITEMS
AT RANDOM
2/ THE SCREEN CLEARING FROM THE FEEDBACK SEEMS TO BE SLOW AND NOT
HAPPENING UPON SUBJECT'S RESPONSE. ANY IDEA OF WHY THIS SHOULD BE SO...?

AGAIN THANKS A LOT FOR YOUR HELP

   Slight fix to the <RevertOuput> keyword, it was only setting up the 
initial output state with the Keithley output drivers and all variants of 
the output devices set the output to 0xffffffff at the end of a job 
regardless of <ro>.  Now <ro> determines the final state of the output 
lines as well as the initial state (as long as it's used before <id 
outputdevice>).  This has become a concern because the new WDM output 
device drivers and their PCI card devices don't leave lines floating high 
like the old ISA PIO12 devices did.  For instance the PCI Computer Boards 
card seems to like leaving the lines low, directly opposite of old 
behavior.  The Keithley stuff lets you specify the initial state, but 
that's from the time window's drivers are initialized, who knows what it's 
state is before then.

I have gotten this message with the previous version of Dmdx and the 
new version recently released.  The computer is a Pent II, Windows 98, 
64 RAM, ATI 3D PRO.  I have a feeling that somthing is wrong with the 
harddrive, but this only appears to be affecting Dmdx as all other 
programs (Word, Excell, Explorer, etc..) work fine and have no trouble 
accessing files in the harddrive.  Any suggestions on how to fix this 
would help.  Thanks.

   Well I found out what's up with the archive's search function, something 
has blasted holes through the whole raw archive so it's no longer 
syntactically correct.  Guess I'll be checking the backups to see if they 
go back far enough and see if I can patch an old and new together somehow.

   See if you can find some new display drivers.  Try the new shortcut 
"DMDX for really bad video cards".

   Hmm, our lovely site licensed SSH client is the culprit, thank goodness 
I've got other ways of transferring files to the server.  I've patched 
together stuff from the backup made on 10/14/02 and added the posts since 
then that weren't corrupted.  Next I guess I get to play twenty questions 
with the SSH programmers...

Dear DMDX users,

we are having mysterious problems with a couple of new machines that our 
lab just received. They are P4 1.8GHz Pentiums with onboard SiS650 video 
and onboard Avance AC97 Audio, running Win98. I installed DMDX 3.0, and 
now have the problem that DMDX is crashing at seemingly random intervals 
during experimental runs. Specifically, I have an experiment that shows 
bmp's on the screen, and uses <id recordvocal> to digitize the 
participant's response. Either, DMDX quits without any feedback, and the 
system returns to the Windows desktop, or I receive the following error 
message:

"Capture lock failed
DSERR_INVALIDPARAM (80070057)
An invalid parameter was passed to the returning function"

Upon clicking "OK", DMDX quits.

Could anyone point me towards possible sources of this error? The above 
error message doesn't even provide any hints (to me) regarding where the 
problem occurs. Incidentally, I have already tried out the following two 
things:

-ctrl-alt-delete all processes, one-by-one, that might cause a 
problem,eventually leaving only "Explorer" and "Systray" running. No 
difference - still random crashes.

- installed a Creative Sound Blaster PCI 128 sound card to replace the 
onboard sound. Same outcome.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Markus Damian

Hi Markus,

The typical suggestion is to try installing new video drivers.

Although these are new machines, the drivers supplied by manufacturers are 
often not very up-to-date. We've had problems with the default drivers 
installed on recent Dell machines that were fixed by downloading an update.

Best wishes,

Matt

now have the problem that DMDX is crashing at seemingly random intervals
during experimental runs. Specifically, I have an experiment that shows
bmp's on the screen, and uses &lt;id recordvocal&gt; to digitize the
participant's response. Either, DMDX quits without any feedback, and the
system returns to the Windows desktop, or I receive the following error
message:<br><br>
&quot;Capture lock failed<br>
DSERR_INVALIDPARAM (80070057)<br>
An invalid parameter was passed to the returning function&quot;<br><br>
Upon clicking &quot;OK&quot;, DMDX quits.<br><br>
Could anyone point me towards possible sources of this error? The above
error message doesn't even provide any hints (to me) regarding where the
problem occurs. Incidentally, I have already tried out the following two
things:<br><br>
-ctrl-alt-delete all processes, one-by-one, that might cause a
problem,eventually leaving only &quot;Explorer&quot; and
&quot;Systray&quot; running. No difference - still random
crashes.<br><br>
- installed a Creative Sound Blaster PCI 128 sound card to replace the
onboard sound. Same outcome.<br><br>
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br><br>

   Not in this instance, it's the audio drivers that need replacement.  I 
assume this is under windows XP?  Audio drivers are especially suspect 
under 2k/XP.  I have just seen exactly the same situation on a number of 
machines here, one with exactly the same audio chipset, the AC'97.  Once I 
found good drivers all DMDX problems went away.  Creative drivers are 
terrible too, visit their website and get the latest drivers.

   Of course there are two machines that I can't fix, one has a sound card 
that I just plain gave up on ever getting working a long time ago so it 
doesn't really surprise me that I can't get drivers that work for it, the 
other is a recent Compaq laptop and unfortunately their latest drivers 
don't fix the thing.  We found that using <id DigitalVOX> without 
RecordVocal solved a lot of problems but the machine will still 
periodically get locked up for ~300 ticks but at least it continues on 
afterwards.  I have suggested that the user try different values of the T 
parameter that determines the buffer length used by the capture routines, I 
have found that buffer length often changes the way badly behaving drivers 
perform.

I am currently in contact with Dell about getting the appropriate

for really bad video cards".  I have looked in the site, where can I 
find this shortcut?

See if you can find some new display drivers. Try the new shortcut 
"DMDX for really bad video cards".

   It's only available on versions later than 3.0.0.03. It's on your 
machine, click the Start button and then navigate to Programs / DMDX.

           You want to use the comma frame separator that 
        merges two displays as if 
        they were one, all displays should be merged with the white 
        square.  Feedback also has a an only clear behind it option:

orkeyword.htm

-------------------

Yes but even if the displays are merged with the white square, when the
subject's response is given, the display is cleared (since i am using
the clearfeedback keyword: this is because i want the disappearence of
the picture, not of the square, to be tied to the subject's response);

If i specify 'only clear behind', well that still clears part of the
square (a small text zone in fact).

I suppose one way to do what I want would be by specifying that the
feedback is not text, but the white blanck square(a bmp file) so that it
shows up right after the response, is that possible?

Another way i have found is to use the following script, which plays
with variants of feedback to ensure a continuity of display on the
screen (press spacebar to go from one trial to another, verbal response
to the picture stimuli)

<ExtendedParameters>
<AzkiiResponses>
<ContinuousRun>
<InputDevice DigitalVOX>
<InputDevice "keyboard">
<MapPositiveResponse +DigitalVOX>
<MapNegativeResponse +space>
<Timeout 2500>
<BackgroundColor 000000000>
<DefaultWritingColor 255255255>
<VideoMode 640,400,8,0>
<EndOfParameters>

-001 <NoFeedback> / <ms% 500> <bmp> "vide.bmp" /*<bmp>"question.bmp";
+002 <ClearFeedback> / <ms% 500> <bmp>"vide.bmp" / <ms% 700> <bmp> 
+"fixation.bmp" / *<BMP> "Fill-A-Bell.BMP";
-003 <NoFeedback> / <ms% 500> <bmp> "vide.bmp"/ *<bmp>"question.bmp";
+004 <ClearFeedback> / <ms% 50> / <ms% 500> <bmp>"vide.bmp" / <ms% 700> 
+<bmp> "fixation.bmp" / *<BMP> "Fill-A-Barrel.BMP";

+<bmp> "fixation.bmp" / *<BMP> "Fill-A-Comb.BMP";


This script has two problems, however:
1/The digital vox and keyboard inputs have some weird interaction such
that as soon as you use digital vox, it triggers all the following items
at random

2/The screen clearing from the feedback seems to be slow and not
happening right after the subject's response but after a short although
visisble delay. Any idea of why this should be so...?

Again thanks a lot for your help


Xavier

   Good point, clearfeedback won't work for you.

   Yes.  You'll have to write a custom feedback routine like the one in the 
branching docs:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhbranchkeyword.htm

   You'll just want an item that displays your white square and returns.

   You may well have exposed a hole in the code, usually no extra mappings 
are made with the DigitalVOX as it binds +DigitalVOX automatically.  My 
guess is that it's the space bar being used a negative response that's 
blowing things up, the Digital VOX thread expects to be the one terminating 
the item, I didn't consider the situation of a negative response coming in 
before the VOX triggers.  I'll see if I can take this into account as I'm 
rebuilding all that code to have the DigitalVOX terminate RecordVocal.

   There's a feedback delay in there but if you build a custom feedback 
routine as outlined above you'll have control of that delay.

           Yes.  You'll have to write a custom feedback 
        routine like the one in the 
        branching docs:
        
        http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxh
        branchkeyword.htm
        
           You'll just want an item that displays your white 
        square and returns.

I have had a curious recurring problem with DMDXs 3.0 and earlier on different computers -- some <wav> instructions sometimes 'play' twice.  

For example (see below), line 1000 can repeat itself before moving to the next line.  Am I overlooking something obvious like setting the Set Visual Probe parameter?

I once had a problem with a pop-up message window from Kiethley whenever I started DMDX.  The problem went away when I uninstalled the Kiethley software.  DMDX doesn't care and everything runs perfectly.

But today I noticed that Windows (98) device manager reports the PIO-12 as a 'broken device' (or whatever Bill Gates called it).  Again, DMDX doesn't care and everything runs perfectly.

   Looks like too little of a fragment for me to determine much.  Off hand 
without seeing your item file my guess is you've uncovered some new and 
extremely rare error in DMDX, I've never heard of it playing a wave file 
twice.  I'd have to see the item file.

Jonathan,

I have just upgraded OS to Win2K and am running a project using Recordvocal
and DigitalVox.  I am getting the "capture lock failed" error that was
reported by someone else recently.  I am using a creative sound blaster 5.1
platinum card.  As recommended, I updated the drivers to the latest
available at the creative website.  Problem still exists.  Portion of code
below.  Any further suggestions?

Subject: [DMDX] RecordVocal



   Not that expect anyone to actually provide me with info but I'll ask
anyway.  Has anyone been using RecordVocal under Windows 2000 or XP
yet?  We've got some anomalous behavior from a machine down stairs that I
would normally attribute to drivers but a laptop also throws error which
makes me suspicious.  Basically something interrupts DMDX for hundreds of
ticks and causes RecordVocal to toss and error about invalid parameters to
the lock function.  Updating drivers on the machines which would be my
normal response might be impossible because the drivers might not exist and
rather than go to all the hassle of installing a known good audio device
I'd like to know that someone has in fact got DirectSoundCatupre stuff
(RecordVocal and DigitalVOX) functioning under 2k/XP.

   I'd suggest not using RecordVocal under XP or 2K until I complete it's 
overhaul, just use DigitalVOX and forgo saving the vocalizations.  It uses 
a method of operation that appears to have been overlooked by driver 
writers (that method being to just gather a single buffer of audio data), 
once overhauled that code will be removed -- not so much because I was 
having trouble with drivers under XP but because it had to go to allow 
variable length RecordVocal recordings.

   I'm able to get existing RecordVocal code to function on XP machines but 
finding the driver that doesn't fail is pretty tough and I imagine the 
situation is twice as bleak under w2k.  Sometimes I have to use the latest, 
sometimes the earliest (as was the case with the Creative Labs AudioPCI 
card in a Dell machine).

Jonathan,

I posted the original message on the capture lock failure. Just wanted 
to point out that I am using Win98, not XP or 2000. Following your 
suggestions, I have looked for updated drivers to the AC97 audio onboard 
chip, but to no avail. Same goes for the SoundBlaster PCI 128 card that 
I tried to replace the onboard audio with - the driver appears to be the 
latest one. With both sound devices, DMDX still occasionally either 
crashes without any error message, or returns the capture lock failure.

   Hmm, you might want to try the latest 4in1 VIA update, if you've got a 
VIA chipset in your machine it could be the culprit.

   You might also want to upgrade to winME, I notice my test bed has an 
AC97 in it and I don't recall ever updating it's drivers (beyond maybe the 
4in1).

   Given the increasing RecordVocal problems on an number of machines I've 
decided to release the overhauled DirectSoundCapture code.  The new code 
can produce variable length recordings if a parameter to RecordVocal is 
provided that tells it how many milliseconds beyond the trigger to record 
otherwise it runs in legacy mode as it always did.  The new code can also 
have recording aborted for a trial with abort key specified by <aikn>.  It 
also survives having something else generate a response but doesn't record 
beyond the response.

   Looks like there's a hole in the new RecordVocal code that only shows up 
under XP that slipped through my early testing.  First trial will be 
recorded correctly but subsequent trials are only a few milliseconds long, 
I'm looking at it.

   Well the parameter that I thought no one would have to change looks like 
it's going to have get set for all XP installations, at least until I 
release the next version with a different default or figure out how to deal 
with the XP signalling being so exceptionally lagged.  The parameter is the 
second RecordVocal parameter that controls how much overrun in the 
recording buffer  DMDX can handle, the default is currently 50 
milliseconds, on two XP boxes here it has to be set at 500 or so otherwise 
the buffer overruns and DMDX only saves the overrun.  It's pretty odd 
because the initiation of the buffer is certainly not similarly lagged, 
maybe it's just that it takes eons to turn off DirectSoundCapture buffers 
under XP.

   I should point out this is only a problem when the new RecordVocal code 
is used under XP in legacy mode where it just records for the full timeout 
value each trial -- the fix is <id recordvocal 0,500>.  Use of the new 
variable length recording will only be affected if there is no vocalization 
and the buffer times out, for safety <id recordvocal 100,500> could be used 
if recording 100ms after the trigger is desired.  I'll add code next week 
that detects buffer overruns and flags errors in the output and diagnostics 
-- pretty messy code which is why it didn't go in before this but clearly 
it's going to be needed.

   Thinking about it it occurs to me that XP taking so much time to stop 
the capturing may explain the wide spread instability that the old code 
caused, it used a mode of operation where the sampling had to stop so when 
it couldn't stop it blew holes in things.

   Well there's definitely some bad mojo under XP with the DigitalVOX 
device in the 3.0.0.09 release, I should really have waited longer before 
releasing that.  Looks like 9X/ME is fine but while things no longer break 
the machine under XP I'm seeing _wild_ variations in my automatic testing 
itemfile where the sound card's output is routed to the line input and a 
wave file is played with a beep a constant time after the clockon.  Like 
300ms of variability.  If I turn RecordVocal on I can see extra data at the 
start so it's not DMDX doing it, it's coming from the capture device.  My 
guess is the drivers don't like being turned on and off and either I have 
to figure out some way to coax the things into functioning properly like 
they do under 9X/ME or I have to figure out how to have the capture running 
indefinitely which makes a writing RecordVocal data out and the end of the 
trial problematic.

Is the problem that you are observing with XP likely to exist for Win2000 as well?  I ask b/c I just collected some data using the DigitalVOX and RecordVocal with the latest version of DMDX and the RTs were all over the place.

   More than likely, there's not much difference between the two other than 
2k's drivers are generally worse than XP's.

Hi,

I have downloaded dmdx 2905 for use on a win95 OS.  Whenever I start 
timedx i get the message that the dll file dinput.dll is missing. I was 
wondering if this is maybe due to the fact that dmdx2905 isn't the 
version I should use with win 95?

any suggestions?

Kathy,

I am glad you are considering taking my PSY 288 course. The textbook we are
using is D. Reisberg (2000) "Cognition: Exploring the Science of Mind". The
format of the course is a weekly 20-question multiple-choice test and a
cumulative 50-question open-book final exam.

I must warn though that it is not an easy course; the material is difficult
and the work has to be done on a regular basis otherwise one can fall
hopelessly behind.

Sincerely,
Irina Sekerina, Ph.D.
Assistant Professor of Psychology

   Just to keep people abreast of what's happening I've completed the 
second much more major overhaul of DirectSoundCapture code and while we now 
have properly functioning RecordVocal and DigitalVOX devices under XP I've 
exposed a gaping hole in the winME AC97 drivers...grr.  So I guess I'll 
completely scrap any attempt to stop the buffers and just leave them 
running freely and stick a whole bunch of new code in to stop the 
RecordVocal data from getting overwritten.

Hi,

I have installed dmdx on several machines here, except for one they all 
work fine. The one that has a problem runs all tests fine and then when 
i do a syntax check  over features.rtf it runs all lines of the file and 
then says:  write to output file failed  disk full.

checked the disk: it isn't full (in fact it has almost 4 GB left). I 
have all rights to read and write in folder in which features.rtf is 
stored.

The machine isn't exactly brand new, but I have installed win98 just the 
other day. To do this I took off winnt and reformated the harddisk. 
Could it still be that the disk isn't integral?

best,

hi

check the read only feature in the informations attached to your 
file (right click on the icon): to the file itself, not just the 
folder. if the file is read only (i have noticed that files sometimes 
become read only at random on windows) they don't run in dmdx and 
you get the disk full message


meybe it s something else

cheers

   You could just run the disk checker on it and be sure.  If it's ok 
something has to be RO somewhere in there though.

Hi Guys
I have had the same problem and have (unsatisfactorally " got around it" )
by loading the prog, running it, terminating it, exit, restarting dmdx, and
.put in subject no and start
(do not reload the file as it is already there/via browse etc).  If you
reload your file the problem persists

This seems to run OK (results)
However one has to be prepared to endure the rigmoroll.

   If people with this problem would check what job1.zil has in it and 
where it is this might help me deduce what is failing on these machines.

   After threefold reconstruction I think I finally have code in version 
3.0.0.11 of DMDX for the RecordVocal and DigitalVOX devices that works (a) 
with all manner of poor sound card drivers because it never tries to turn 
the capture buffers off or do anything even remotely fancy with them (b) 
works under both winME and XP (c) works with variable length recordings and 
(d) gets around a dozen other problems I'm not even going to 
mention.  Messy messy messy stuff but RTs with my automatic digital vox 
tester script are all plus or minus a millisecond or so on my 
machines.  The XP box has horrible latency (playing + recording) of 38ms 
but better drivers may reduce that.  The winME box with it's AC97 has 1.5ms 
of latency for comparison.

   Well that didn't take too long to find a mistake.  For now if you intend 
to use both RecordVocal and DigitalVOX the DigitalVOX definition should 
precede the RecordVocal one like so:

<ep> N5 <azk> <cr> <fd 43> <d 0> <t 5000> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 0>
  <id DigitalVox>  <id recordvocal 100>
   <id keyboard> <dbc 255255255> <dwc 0> </ep>

   If DigitalVOX comes second it looks like it never sees any signal so it 
never generates a trigger -- RecordVocal does however dutifully record 
until the timeout occurs.

   Also looks like RecordVocal won't run in legacy mode with a DigitalVOX, 
it will always stop recording some time after the trigger.  Not major 
problems so I won't be addressing them till next week.  Like I said, messy.

Hi,

 I am having problems running the program I attach below. The problem is
that RTs
taken from the michrophone are not register for one trial. That is, the
program
works perfectly, but in one single trial out of the 33, the computer
does not
register the answer of the subject and as a consequence a non-response
is
recorded. To make things worse, the missing trial is completely at
random. Any
suggestions?

   Works fine on my test bed under 3.0.0.11.  If you are using an older 
version of DMDX I did see at least one machine's driver failure take a form 
similar to the one you describe.

   Yes, it takes a pretty complex item file and I guess I should add a 
chapter to the help on it but I haven't yet.  This technique also works 
with scrambling.  Basically you create two item files, the first is the 
seed that starts a given subject off and doesn't do anything more than 
initialize a counter for each item to zero then saves them with 
<SaveCounters> and chains to the second item file with <Chain>.  This 
second file can also be run again and again till all items have been 
presented.  Each item in the second file only executes if it's unique 
counter is zero (ie it has a branch before it that skips to the next item 
if the respective counter is non-zero), when it does execute it increments 
that counter.  When the item file finishes it saves the counters so it can 
be run again.  You'll have to toss periodic probes into the file to see if 
the experimenter wants to stop, you could use <MultiWayBranch> for 
responses and if an abort key is pressed the item branches to the end to 
save the counters and exit, other branches would be to record a positive 
and negative response and so forth -- you could use <MultiWayCall> to 
simplify that.  Fairly complex.

   Yep, 3.0.0.11 puts much less strain on sound capture drivers but simply 
turning them on and leaving them on all the time.

   Of course, the first thing the second item file does is to use 
<RestoreCounters>...

Hi,
Can somebody please help me on this?:
I resently downloaded DMDX (I'm new with it) version 2.9.06.
It runs fine, but at the end the quit command restarts the PC from scrach.
This happends both with my own scripts and those from examples pick from the 
net.
I use Windows 2002 XP ver 5.01.2600 with Pentim III 500 and RAM 256.
Thanks
Ricardo

   Actually that's not likely to fix what you're experiencing, more than 
likely you have shoddy video card drivers (I'll bet you have an ATI video 
card in fact) and need to find some new ones.  Do a search of the archives 
for "drivers", tons of things could be the cause of your problems:

Thanks for your fast answer.
I cheked the graphic card, it is
NVIDIA TNT2/AGP/SSE ver 1.3.1
Could this be causing the crash?
I also have DirectX 7

   Yep.  You can either update DMDX and use the shortcut for GeForce video 
cards or muck with shortcut to DMDX and add "-buffers 4" to the command 
line. The 3.0.8.7 drivers from Windows Update look like pretty good drivers 
but you'll still need the special shortcut.  I'm told this will be fixed 
when DX9 gets released but I'm not holding my breath as NVIDIA have been 
resistant to say the least towards fixing this particular problem as DMDX 
is the only program in the world that uses the broken features.

>I also have DirectX 7

   Not under windows XP you don't, that's DirectX 8 at the minimum.  If you 
really do have DX7 maybe there's something broken with your windows install.

DMDX 3.0.05 running under Swedish Windows 98 and with a Swedish keyboard will not respond to input when using 'line 0' item files.  e.g.,

0 "press key to continue" ;
  
DMDX just sits there and will not respond to any keypress.  Strange because the same script runs fine in other machines (English Win 98 and Swedish keyboard). The only difference is that in the Swedish language OS, I have to rename the input device from 'keyboard' to: <id tangentbord> or DMDX won't run.

I just have to upgrade DMDX and leave out the <id> parameter, right?

Thanks,

   Escape should abort it though.

   Yes, I usually just stick a ! at the start of the keyword (<!id 
keyboard> for instance) to make it into a comment.  And any mapping 
keywords like <mr>.  If you want to change mappings and make an item file 
that is language independent you'll have to use <id #keyboard> and map keys 
with things like <mr +#23>, TimeDX will tell you the numbers.

Forgive my ignorance. Does anyone successfully use DMDX with sound 
input (through the microphone jack) with a C-Media CMI8738/C3DX PCI 
Audio Device?

   Yeah, that's one the few good ones.  Hit windows update and use the 
latest drivers there if it's not working.

   Ok, after days of debuggering I finally located what was blowing up 
DigitalVOX definitions after RecordVocal ones.  So 3.0.0.12 has that issue 
resolved along with legacy RecordVocal now records for something close to 
the timeout, RecordVocal still only records for approximate durations and 
damned if I can get it to do otherwise so I suspect we live with it -- I've 
busted things several times trying to rectify this and I don't think the 
issue is worth it personally.

Hi,
I would appreciate any help on the following problem I encountered.

I am preparing an experiment in which participants (kids) hear a word and
have to repeat it. Each response is saved in a file using Recordvocal. This
part is working perfectly. However, I am having difficulties with the two
following things:

First, I would like to save one of two keys corresponding to whether the
response was incorrect or not. I could not figure out a way of saving BOTH
this information and the vocal responses.

Second, I would like to repeat the same item several times subsequently
untill the participant produce a vocal response. For instance, the subjects
hear a word, and can hear it again and again untill he feels confident and
produce a response. I used Branching N in which N refers to the same item.
But I have a branching error message telling me that the item is not found.
I've pasted behind a sample of the script I am using.

Thanks for your help,
-Sid

   It's called Zillion response mode, I'll be writing an overview of DMDX 
input modes in the near future, till then follow the links from this page:

   You need to use negative numbers, a branch to a positive item goes 
forwards, negative goes backwards.

   Thinking some more on this I suspect you don't in fact want to use 
<zillion> responses but instead want item pairs (note the new G2 parameter) 
and lots of mapping and unmapping of responses.  For example:

G2  <S 8> <azk> <ExtendedParameters> <id DigitalVox> <id RecordVocal>
<id "keyboard"> <NoFeedback 0><ClearFeedback> < MapRequest +Space> <
MapPositiveResponse +1>  < MapNegativeResponse +0> <NoTimeLimit>
<AbortItemKeyName +q> <EndOfParameters>
$
0 "Press SPACEBAR to start";
250 <ms% 500> /;
$
+1  <wav 2> "pies"/ * <umpr> <mpr +digitalvox>;
+10 * <umpr> <mpr +1> <biw -1>;

+2  <wav 2> "shoes"/ *  <umpr> <mpr +digitalvox>;
+20 * <umpr> <mpr +1> <biw -2>;

I am getting the exact same error message that Kwangoh describes 
below when I attempt the Sound Test in TimeDX. I have now downloaded 
and installed the latest driver for my C-Media CMI8738/C3DX PCI Audio 
Device. I also upgraded to DMDX 3.0.0.12, just for the heck of it. 
Then I once again turned off all of the other running tasks. (The 
exception was Explorer. When I would try to turn it off, it would 
threaten to shut down the computer.) The error message continues when 
I attempt to do the Sound Test. Are Kwangoh and I unique. (My goal 
for now is a simple naming experiment.)

   The TimeDX Sound Recording test hasn't changed, it still uses 
non-looping buffers and is proof positive that whatever drivers exist for 
the C-Media under win98 are crap.  The odd thing is that the C-Media 
drivers are totally fine under winXP.  Well, I wouldn't worry about it, if 
you like you can use the TimeDX Sound Latency test as that uses the looping 
buffers but in order for the test to work you'll have to connect the sound 
output to the input.  Otherwise just see if DMDX is recording vocalizations 
properly.

I am trying to obtain magnitude estimates on the numberpad using DMDX3. I
am able to collect number responses if they are typed on the main part of
the keyboard, but not when typed on the numpad. It is my understanding
that in this newest version of DMDX, the numpad is automatically mapped
once <id keyboard> is used. I also tried adding in a <zek>, but I still
couldn't get the input from the numpad to register. Any help would be
greatly appreciated. Thanks, Angelina

We recently received an identical error message when trying to set up 
DMDX2.9.05 on a brand new Toshiba Tecra 9100 laptop.  The video card was an S3 
SuperSavage IXC1179 with the original drivers provided by Toshiba.  

However, we persisted and tried a few different resolutions at different colour 
settings, and we had some success.  The results are reproduced below 
(IPF=Invalid Pixel Format error message):

1024x768x8 = Selected mode in TimeDX but would not time the mode, producing the 
IPF.  However, DMDX would run if automatic values were used.
1024x768x16 = Would not select mode in Time DX, producing the IPF.
1024x768x32 = Fine. 

800x600x8 = Fine, but with high certain errors when timing the video mode.
800x600x16 = Would not select mode in Time DX, producing the IPF.
800x600x32 = Would not select mode in Time DX, producing the IPF.

640x480x8 = Fine 
640x480x16 = Fine, with very low certain errors when timing the video mode.
640x480x32 = Would not select mode in Time DX, producing the IPF.

The reason we obtained this pattern of results is unclear (well, to us, 
anyway!).  Nevertheless, we thought it was worth sharing with the list for the 
benefit of other users. The upshot being that Jonathan's suggestion was a very 
good one - if you get the IPF, it is indeed worth trying a few different video 
modes before making the move to another machine.

Anna Woollams & Craig Richardson.

   The <zek> documentation states that it only works with keys whose names 
are a single character and the numeric pad keys have multiple character 
names.  The main keyboard A to Z and 0 to 9 keys have single character names.

Hi anna and j
Just some additional info.....
I have had these probs on TE2000 laptops.
Out of three of these L/Ps, one worked ..the difference appears to be that
the drivers, instead of ---
 trident video accelerator cyberblade XP Ai1 X  V5.9030-008A.221CDNP

WAS ---- trident video accelerator cyberblade XP Ai1 X  V5.9030-008X.22.
I think this is an earlier version
This is the only difference I could find

happy hunting

The solution to this problem turned out to be simple. When I turn off 
"MULTI-SPK" in the sound control panel  (or whatever you call it), 
the problem goes away. When I get back to DMDX a week and a half from 
now, I'll probably be back here. So far, when I try to use the 
microphone as an input device (DigitalVOX only), the computer 
profoundly crashes, reminiscent of the problem caused before by the 
video card.

Sorry for the delay in replying to this - I've been inundated with
emails lately... I don't personally run DMDX under Win2K, but I do use
DMDX on a Latitude running a clean install of Win98SE. The Latitude
seems to give a few *weird* errors sometimes (clusters of certain errors
that Matt Davis and I weren't easily able to eliminate). The other thing
to watch is the millisecond timer - the first Latitude I used was giving
a mean rather higher than it should have been...

More generally I wouldn't recommend buying the Latitude. In the two
years that I've had it, I've had to call the engineer out several times
and have got through two motherboards, four keyboards, several touch
pads and still have strange problems with the on-board soundcard.

Hope that helps,
Stuart.

   Yeah, that's just the thing with busted drivers, changing the smallest

I'm a new user of DMDX and I'm using it to design a visual search task.  In 
order to reduce the number of bitmaps I need I would like to use small 
separate bitmaps for each item appearing in a display (so that I can reuse 
them throughout the experiment), rather than creating a new large bitmap 
showing the whole display for each new trial.

Could anyone let me know whether each bitmap will be added separately to 
the screen or whether they're all going to be combined into one frame in 
the graphics card and displayed in one go.  Also will this affect the 
timing? We have reduced the number of back buffers to 7 with the -buffers 
command line option, because of problems with the video driver, I don't 
know if this will create a problem when presenting multiple bitmaps. I have 
included an example of the code for two types of possible trial below if 
this helps.



+1 <bmp 0.48, 0.48> <ms% 500> "fixpoint"/ <ms% 2000>  "premaskdisplay1"/ * 
"experimentaldisplay1";

Instead of using the code above I would prefer to use the code below, would 
the timing in the below example be the same as in the above example?

+1 <bmp 0.48, 0.48> <ms% 500> "fixpoint"/ <bmp 0.48, 0.48> <ms% 2000> 
"fixpoint", <bmp 0.41, 0.30> <ms% 2000> "item1", <bmp 0.55, 0.30> <ms%

   Yes, I've actually written programs to write such item files as they can 
be huge and balancing them a dramatic amount of work.  But whether you 
would be able to use them remains doubtful, the rules to balance them 
change with every new experiment that gets done.

   Yes.  The comma frame option is equivalent to "%0 / !".

>   Also will this affect the timing?

    No, frames with zero duration don't add anything to the time of the 
next frame, they only draw into the buffer used to make a frame.  But the 
composite frame's duration must go in the last frame of the composition.

Thanks for your help Jonathan. Here is a sample of the new script I use. The
problem I describe below happens for this sample as well as the the example
you
gave.

<G 2> <S 8> <azk> <ExtendedParameters> <id DigitalVox> <id RecordVocal>
<id "keyboard"> <ClearFeedback> < MapPositiveResponse +1>  <
MapNegativeResponse +0> <NoTimeLimit> <abortItemKeyName +q>
<EndOfParameters>
$
0 "Press SPACEBAR to start";
250 <ms% 500> /;
$
+1  <wav 2> "pies"/   * <umpr> <mpr +digitalvox> c;
+10 *  "0/1" <umpr> <mpr +1> <biw -1>;

The only real trouble now is that the NoTimeLimit function is not working
any
more (every RecordVocal is interupted at 4 seconds, the standard timeout).
Then, the AbortItemKeyName function works and interupts recording but only
it
the key is pressed before 4 seconds. There is apparently something
preventing
the NoTimeLimit but I could not figure out what it is?

Finally, is it possbile to set up things such that the abortItemKeyName
correspond to the positive or negative request. For instance, in the
previous
samples, the key "q" is pressed to interupt recording, and then pressing
key "1" or "0" indicates whether the response (pronunciation) was correct or
not. If it was not correct, the items is played again.
Now, is it possible to have the 1 or 0 key press corresponding both to the
abortItemKeyName and to the correct or incorrect response.


I am using the most recent version (3.0.0012).

Thanks very much for your help,
-Sid

   Never thought about <ntl> w.r.t. to RecordVocal, guess I'll have to 
update the docs.  <ntl> does not and cannot affect RecordVocal, it can't 
affect it as there has to be a fixed length buffer created that is as large 
as RecordVocal's data can be.  Use a large timeout instead.

   The normal timeout is 4 seconds and that's what you're seeing, you'll 
need to set the T parameter.

   Probably not, once abort item kicks in it starts aborting things left 
right and center.  Try it, see what happens.

Hi,

Has anyone used the new Computerboards PIO card for laptops yet?

The card has recently been changed, it use to be

	PCM - CARD  D24 / CTR 3

but is now called

	PC - CARD  D24 / CTR 3

A small change in name, but the connector has also changed, forcing us to 
buy quite expensive new cables to connect our button boxes.

The question is if someone has experience with these new cards, preferably 
in Windows 2000.


Thanks,

Maarten van Casteren

   I've setup a laptop for someone that uses that card and it works nicely 
although it was under winME.

   Yes, the connectors are expensive but there's no way you could have a 
DB37 attached to a PCMCIA card anyway.  You could just buy the connectors 
yourself but good luck wiring them up, looked like it required a special 
multi hundred dollar tool to me.  I don't think the connector has changed 
from it's incarnation as the PCM-CARD-D24/CTR3, the name change is I 
suspect due to the term PC-CARD supplanting PCMCIA, an acronym that only 
techs could remember.    I don't see why their drivers would be suspect 
though, they're rock solid under 2k/XP for the other cards.

   Yep, you can use all of the above either together or individually -- be 
forewarned that mice tend to add together and behave as one device if there 
are more than one of them plugged into the same machine at the same time 
(might not under 2k/XP, I can check at work tomorrow).  The SD can only be 
determined on an empirical basis, ie by measuring it on the machine it's 
going to get used on and that requires test equipment that can press the 
buttons on the devices at an accurate rate.  If however you lack the 
technical expertise to do so you are welcome to send me one of any of the 
devices in question and I can benchmark them on one of my machines which 
will give you a pretty good idea of how the device will perform on your 
machine -- however I get to keep the devices sent to me ;)

   The multiple USB mice are still added together and appear as one device 
in TimeDX on my winXP machine.  Oddly enough the winME box sees the PS/2 
device separately from the USB one but the USB button presses appear on 
both devices so it's no particular use.  Both machines are using Logitech 
drivers so perhaps there would be different behavior with raw drivers -- 
but I'm not betting on it, my understanding is that mice are always added 
together into one device.

   DMDX 3.0.0.13 and TimeDX 3.0.6 have a minor fix that should iron out 
display errors that were occurring early on on some machines.  They now 
flush the registry after firing up DirectX as DirectX is prone to writing 
things to the registry that eventually get flushed to disk at some later 
date, sometimes as early items are being displayed.

   More significantly the help finally has an index and is now searchable 
along with having a favorites tab.  It's got an overviews section designed 
to provide help on aspects of DMDX that aren't really elaborated in one 
place anywhere else which will probably get expanded over time as topics 
occur to me.  These new features, especially the searchability should make 
the help file a much easier thing to get information out of.  The one cost 
of all this .CHM help conversion has been the loss of the ability to read 
the help from the beginning to the end but I don't think very many people 
ever did that so it's no big loss.

   All of which pretty much completes the work I had intended to do for 
version 3 so if you were holding off upgrading till things settled down 
things will be settling down now.  Knocks on wood.

Is the manuscript on the timing accuracy of DMDX that is provided on the

Hello,

I'm trying to use DMDX to play a video clip and record a reaction time to a
beep in the soundtrack of the clip, but I have two problems.  First, I
generally only get about 140 of my 150 frames played, with several frames
dropped near the beginning of the clip.  I've got a 2.8Ghz machine from
Dell with 528MB RAM and a Nvidia graphics card, but does anyone have any
extra tips for improving video performance?  

Second, and much more important, I'm getting out silly values for my
reaction times.  When I play the clip "ball_2112.avi", where I know that
the beep comes exactly 2112 ms into the clip, I get out a reaction time of
2063 (and similar values on every other trial), but I can't be psychic!, so
something is going very wrong with timing.  I've tried changing the point
in the file where the clock starts from <dv* 1> to <dv* 60> (and other
values) with no effect.  Here are a couple of lines from my input and
output files:

ball.rtf file
f70 s100 <vm 800,600,600,32,75> <!safemode 1> <NoFeedback> <delay 10> <azk>
<id keyboard>
+6  "get ready"/  <dv -1,.1> "ball_2112" <dv* 1> / c;

ball.azk file
!  Played 141 frames of 150 in ball_2112.avi
     6   2063.44

Finally, every time I end an experiment, DMDX shows me lots of useful info
abut how long it took to load each trial etc in the command window, but I
can't cut & paste or save it anywhere for future reference - is that possible?

Thank you very much for your help,

Antonia.

   The delay is probably from your file system, you could try other digital 
video file formats but the underlying media is likely to be at fault.  You 
can check if you've already got a 7200RPM IDE disk, if so your only faster 
option is a SCSI disk.  But SCSI will require a controller as well as a new 
disk all of which will cost you around three times what a IDE disk will 
cost you.  OTOH you could put a few blank frames at the start of the 
digital video...

   You could try creating a RAM disk and playing the video from that just 
to determine if it's the disk or the codec but I don't even know if it's 
possible to create a RAM disk under windows, it's an old DOS thing.

   Perhaps frame 1 doesn't get played until those 9 or ten frames have been 
dropped or those frames now represent some kind of latency in the codec 
(which define the meaning of black box).  At 30Hz that's 1/3 of a second 
which is well within human RT latency.

   That's a pretty cool test, kudos to Matt.  But it needs to have <nfb> in 
the parameter line to suppress the feedback as it is the displaying of the 
feedback that is upsetting your timing.

OK, so I haven't got a SCSI drive (just the fastest IDE) and both my movies
and the sample mpg drop frames under the video test in TimerDX too, so I
guess my system just isn't fast enough.  Is there any chance that a future
version of DMDX will have the capacity to preload a movie, then specify
when to start playing it? 

So, I'm now using the alternative method of displaying lots of bitmaps in
sequence and superimposing a beep where I like, which works fine (at least
it looks OK).  I was hoping to test the overall timing of each squence by
starting the clock before my set of 150 bitmaps and reading the clock at
the end, just to assess how reliable the whole thing is.  But I can't find
a 'read clock' function - is there one?

One more query about videos, cos I'm sure I will be using them again in the
future - how does the dvclock decide how many frames have elapsed?  The
'psychic' reaction time problem I described before wasn't fixed by starting
the clock well after the dropped frames, so it is not just a weird problem
with the video starting up.  My guess is that the dv clock is only counting
the frames which have been presented, which means it is starting at the
wrong point when frames are dropped - is that right?  That means that
putting a few blank frames at the start of my clip would make it look nice,
but without a lot of extra calculation of how many were dropped each time a
clip is played, I don't think I can get an accurate reaction time to the
events in the clip.

Thanks very much for your help,

Antonia.

   No, not unless Microsoft add that feature to their stuff.  If I were you 
I'd try a number of different codecs, .AVI, .MPG, and so on.  They will all 
perform very differently.  Also, why can't you add a number of filler 
frames to the start of the digital video?

   If there aren't any timing errors reported in the .AZK or diagnostic 
files there are no errors.  If you don't trust that there's no reason to 
trust anything else the program might report so building some external test 
equipment is the only option.  But of course, then you've got to trust the 
test equipment...

>One more query about videos, cos I'm sure I will be using them again in the

   Before the digital video is played the time in the sequence that the 
clockon frame would be played is calculated by asking the codec for the 
duration of a frame.  As the frames are playing each frame is queried for 
the timestamp of that frame, if it's at or beyond the clockon time the 
clock is turned on.  So we're at the mercy of the codec, if it's got built 
lag and so forth there's not a lot we can do except fudge it -- in your 
case by adding a number of frames at the start of the video.  I never built 
any latency calculations into the DV stuff like the sound stuff has in it.

   No, it's likely to be latency in the codec, if it's a high compression 
codec then it probably needs a number of frames before it can deliver 
anything.  It's all smoke and mirrors.

   That's my recommendation with respect to digital video full stop, forget 
about accurate or reliable timing, it's all best guess stuff.  OTOH, I'd be 
surprised if there was much variability between one clip starting and 
another, esp. with a 2.8GHz P4.  Try an .AVI file format, there's no 
compression so while a lot more data has to be read and moved there's less 
likely to be weird shenanigans played by the codec.

   Not that I'm condoning the HTML postings to the list that have been 
becoming more and more frequent lately but it's pretty irritating not 
having the list serv threader display them correctly so I changed it to 
handle them.  Well some of them anyway, I notice Derek Eder's HTML is still 
pretty much gibberish but those are multi part postings so the plain text 
that occurs first is readable.  Hopefully I didn't bust anything else while 
doing this.

This is probably a very silly question, but I'm trying to remap the
positive and negative response keys to the up and down arrows on my
keyboard, which TimeDX tells me are #200 and #208.  So the first line of my
script is:

f3 s72 <vm 800,600,600,16,75> <NoFeedback> <azk> <id "keyboard"> <mpr
+#200> <mnr +#208>

But when I syntax check that I get the error

Button name <+#200> not found on input devices

So what am I doing wrong?  Other key re-mappings, like <mpr +h> work fine.

Thanks for your help,

Antonia.

   You need to use the #keyboard device (<id "#keyboard">) if you are going 
to use button numbers.  But then +h won't work, I guess you could load both 
devices (never tried it) however the usual solution is to use the regular 
keyboard device with <id "keyboard"> and to use the arrow key names with 
<mpr "+up arrow"> and so on.

I seem to remember that there's a way to suppress the decimal points in

I think you want the feedback precision keyword, with which you can
specify the number of decimal places to be used for feedback:

<fbp 0>

Hope that helps!

Jonathan,

I am continuing to have problems with recordvocal device running this code:

<ep> d30 f1 <cr><id pio12><t 1500><id digitalVOX><id RecordVocal><id
keyboard><dbc 0><dfs 36><vm 800,600,600,16,0><nfb><ro 5, 255><eop>

+5  * "GREEN" <msfd 500>/ <msfd 1500>/;
0 <ln -2> "Experiment Complete!", <ln 2> "Thank you for your
participation.";

The wav files generated with this code are approximately 600ms long rather
than the 1500 ms indicated in the timeout.  I have read through the recent
posts on this.  I know you suggested that the length would not exactly match
the timeout but this seems a big departure?  I am running v3.0.0.13
(downloaded today). OS is win2k.

If the problem is with the use of recordvocal in legacy mode, it may be
possible to change.  However, I would need to have DMDX continue to record
for a relatively long time after trigger to be certain to get the full
vocalization.  Maybe something like <id recordvocal 500,50>  If I did this,
will DMDX wait until the recording is complete before proceeding to the next
trial or will it still only wait the 1500 ms time out (the latter is what I
would want)?  In other words, if for example a subject triggered the
digitalvox at 1200ms would the DMDX wait until 1700 (1200 + 500) until going
to the next item?

   That's a bigger departure than I saw but then I don't have your hardware 
nor did I ever find out why I couldn't get it record for exactly the right 
length of time so it doesn't really surprise me that the variation can be 
larger than I observed.  You might try altering the second parameter to 
RecordVocal (leaving the first zero) and see if that clears things up, long 
values <id RecordVocal 0,1500> and short <id RecordVocal 0,50> and in 
between values as well should be tried.

   It will wait till the recording is complete.  Well, it did for me anyway 
;)  This is in fact the thing that is causing all the problems for numerous 
technical reasons, making DMDX hang around waiting for something that now 
never stops but instead needs to be ignored beyond a certain time period 
and then flushed to disk is a right pain.  Beforehand the buffer either 
shut itself down (legacy RecordVocal mode) or it was outright ignored when 
only the DigitalVox was used.  Now there are something like twenty 
different conditions that can mark the end of the item and tweaking it is 
no fun.

   Give or take some fraction of 100ms on my hardware, yes.  YMMV and I 
might have start mucking with RecordVocal all over again.



   I sure hope so.

A quick follow-up on the problem with Recordvocal..

Changing from <id recordvocal> to <id recordvocal 0,1500> fixes the problem
with recording length to within tolerance (i.e., approx 1.47 s with a
timeout of 1500ms)  FYI the duration is variable ranging from about 1.46 to
1.49 across four test runs.  Interestingly, it seems to be consistent at
1.49 if no response is detected for an item.

Does changing the overrun buffer from the default to 1500 have any other
effects on the script that I need to be aware of (in particular, any impact
on item timing?)

Thanks J

   That variation is consistent with my results.  I notice you have the 
DigitalVox definition before the RecordVocal definition, you might try 
reversing them and removing the RecordVocal parameters just to see if the 
problem goes away.

   No, it simply chews up a bunch of system memory, something like 3 * 1.5 
* 22050 * 2 bytes which is 200K, no big deal these days.

Dear all,

I am conducting an experiment in which participants are required to read aloud 
some Cantonese characters.  Even though I have downloaded the respective fonts 
in the computer, the Cantonese characters cannot be displayed on running DMDX.
 Curiously, they can be displayed in the syntax with wordpad.  What could 
possibly be the reasons for such a case? How could it be solved?

Moreover, are there any limits in the number of stimulus items to be 
displayed?

Regards,
Mabel Wan

Are you running in full Chinese Windows, Chinese Enabled Windows (if this 
exists) or English Windows?  We have found that with Arabic, DMDX works 
best with Arabic Enabled Windows.  With English Windows the characters are 
not displayed correctly, with Arabic Windows, there are lots of 
font/character defaults that mess up DMDX.  I suggest you have a scan 
through the old messages and find people who are doing experiments in 
Chinese and ask them what they do.  I will ask someone here who does work 
on Chinese.  Also it may make a difference whether you are using the 
Simplified Chinese character set.
