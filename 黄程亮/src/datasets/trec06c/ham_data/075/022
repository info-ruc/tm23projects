Yes, that does the trick, thanks a lot! You may want to 
change the help file on the scramble keyword because it 
is kind of suggestive that it defaults to block size 1, it 
was only on second reading that I realised that the default 
was for the group size parameter rather than the block 
size...

'N defines the scramble block size, the number of groups 
that the scramble routines will move as a unit.  If no 
grouping parameter is present the group size is 1 item'

Anyway, thanks again for your help on this.
