The following is a reply to CCPR report from ggilfoyl@richmond.edu


 hi,
 
    we just got more information on the problem with file transfers to
 richmond via bbftp. i do not think the problem relates to bbftp because
 when logged in via ssh to jlabs1.jlab.org.  when running a traceroute
 and ping continuously i found that after 30 seconds or so the session
 just got cut off for 15-20 seconds and then it came back up again (that
 is why the bbftp and ssh sessions were not working).  
 
 traceroute was able to reach  [192.157.69.12] 
 but was unable to reach	      [134.55.208.45]
 
 these are es.net servers and appear to intermittenly fail between these
 two points.
 if the file is small enough then it can squeeze through the time window
 when the connection is alive.
 
 thanks-in-advance for your help,
 
 jerry gilfoyle
