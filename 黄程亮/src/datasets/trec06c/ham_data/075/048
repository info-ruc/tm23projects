   Should be possible, I think it's an error in the syntax check code, it 
doesn't clear those pending operations unless they actually execute (and in 
a syntax check they don't), 2.3.04 will have that fixed.  BTW, you're 
missing a semi colon in item 1004.   Also f.5 in the parameter line is 
invalid (it'll be interpreted as F0), you can't use seconds to F, only 
counts of frames.  And much to my surprise I find you can't have + 2002 
(space between the CR indicator and the item number), it's got to be +2002, 
might fix that in 2.3.04 too.
