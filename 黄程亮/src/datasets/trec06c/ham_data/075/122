I installed it on psc1 over the weekend.  This is the transfer rate I got
today at 6:30is pm



521593200 bytes got in 441 secs (1.15e+03 Kbytes/sec or 9.01 Mbits/s)

The # of bytes is ~ 73 Megs.


This is ~2.5 times faster than the avg SCP1 btwn machines ON CAMPUS
This is ~10 times faster than SCP2 ON CAMPUS
This is ~10 times slower than FTP ON CAMPUS

Taking into acct that it is faster than SCP1 btwn our own campus tells me
that this is a good way to go.  9 Mbits is a good transfer rate.  I will
start transferring a 2 GIG file and see how that goes, but the speeds look
very to good me.  The only downside was that I was not able to write to the
/work disk, but I am sure I am not supposed to be able to do that (I only
installed the client on psc1, not the server).  If you want the previous
email with the speeds for ON CAMPUS transfers, I sent it 12/9/00.  Hope this
helps.
