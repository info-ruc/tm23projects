I shut it down and rebooted at least twice when I was changing cables so it
looks like I will call RAIDZONE cuz from psc? to psc? I always got at least
9Mbits so it is not the switch.  Do you remember the speeds you got before
when copying stuff from psc1 to pscr1 or did you always copy straight from
jlab to pscr1?
