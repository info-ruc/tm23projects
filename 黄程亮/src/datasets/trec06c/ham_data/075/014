Hello,

I'm currently trying to set up an experiment in which 
subjects are asked to perform a categorisation on visual 
displays. I would like to have the subjects perform this 
categorisation until they reach some criterium performance 
(e.g. 80%). The test script that I've written (see below) 
is intended to use both scrambling and branching and is set 
up analogous to the example available from the user list 
(December 1999) with fixed destination items.

-----------Scramble and Branching Script--------------

When I try to run this script I get the following error 
message:

<$100> Missing Item Number

Does anyone have an idea why this happens?

Cheers, Arie
