Finally gave up on the Montego A3DXtream (if anyone wants it, I'll sell it 
cheap)...  The popping was unacceptable, and turning off the hardware 
acceleration resulted in huge increases in latency and variability (latency 
of > 16 msec, and variability of close to 2 msec).  Furthermore, since 
Aureal just went bankrupt and Creative Labs bought their assets, driver 
updates won't happen anytime soon.  So, I consulted with one of my students 
who is an avid gamer in order to get an idea of what his favorite sound 
card might be.  He recommended one of the new Soundblaster Live Platinum 
cards.  His recommendation was a good one.

The loop-back test did not work.  However, using the CIO/DIO 24 to trigger 
Neuroscan and measuring the latency from the trigger to the sound onset I 
could not believe my eyes.  We measured approx 5 msec latency to sound 
onset, with no measurable variability.  None!  The waveforms from trial to 
trial were virtually identical.  And, this card is cleaner and quieter than 
even my Event Electronics Darla card (specifically designed for multitrack 
digital music recording) in my home PC!!!  In short, the auditory stimuli 
are crystal clear, and I have yet to find evidence for noise or delays.

The best part is that CompUSA has these cards on sale for $99.00!!  An 
inexpensive solution that saves a lot of headaches!!

cheers,

John
