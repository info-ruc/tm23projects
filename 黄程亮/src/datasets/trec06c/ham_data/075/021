   Usually for a specific modification made to DMDX for a non UofA person I 
would ask for a donation to the UofA Psychology Hardware Fund, however the 
current device I want is a digital camera that has a zoom on it so I can 
take closeups of things and retail on a device like the Epson 3000Z is over 
$700US and unless things are amazingly cheap in Taiwan I feel that is a 
little steep for this particular modification.  So, unless you have a 
second hard digital camera that has a zoom on it lying around the place 
that you wouldn't mind giving to me you get this one for nada.

   The keyword you want is a new wrinkle on the <set> keyword in the latest 
version of DMDX, 2.3.03, specifically <set N,LastRT>.  This will allow you 
to store the last RT gathered in a counter and then do a test on that 
counters value.  For a really neat item file you can stuff the test in a 
subroutine, something like the following, assuming 4000ms is your warning 
level and 8000ms the cut off:

F30 T8000
0 "instructions" <bu 1000>;
100 d0 ! %0 <set 1,LastRT> <bicLE 1,3999,110>;
0 "You are taking too long";
110 d0 ! %0 <ret>;
1000 * "target 1" / <call -100>;
1001 * "target 2" / <call -100>;
0 "Done"L;
