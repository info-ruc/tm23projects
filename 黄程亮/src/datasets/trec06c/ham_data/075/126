Same file, 8:30 pm or so.



I assume that the 1 GB file is good enough as a benchmark, but if you want
to
test it out with a 2 GB file, tell me where I can find one in /work or
/cache,
because I couldn't.  I will write up some steps needed to transfer the
files.
It works like a normal ftp, but you must write out all the commands into a
file before connecting (it is not interactive, it just reads the commands
from
this file).
