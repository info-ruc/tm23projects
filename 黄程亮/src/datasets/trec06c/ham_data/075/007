I feel really silly because I should have noticed this.  The freezing was 
due to a shared I/O address that was not apparent unless I specifically 
looked through the I/O addresses (i.e. no devices were reported as being in 
conflict).  Moving the CIO/DIO 24's base address seems to have solved this.

BTW Jonathan:  Thanks for the offer re: test-running our item files.  This 
does not appear to be necessary at present.

best regards,

John
