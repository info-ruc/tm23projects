Dr Vineyard, you are the one with the most experience with the NAS.  Is there 
any reason you can think of that explains why you cannot write to it faster 
than say...100kb/s?  I tried ftp and nfs from psc1 and psc5 and psc12 and got 
no more than 95 kb/s.  I switched cables, no.  I switched cables and hooked it 
up to where psc12 is hooked up on the catalyst switch to see if maybe jack #13 
was not working and that was not it either.  I even set up a monitor, 
keyboard, etc and copied a file from 
/home/common/e1b to /home/common and that did not work any better.  
I then tried reading files from the NAS and copying them over to psc1 and that 
worked fine, I got good speeds.  It seems as if the NAS is not willing to 
write to the disk at all, and that I have no idea why.  Do you have any ideas 
or suggestions?
