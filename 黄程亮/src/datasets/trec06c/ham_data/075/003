Hi, I bet answers can be found in the DMDX manual for the following questions. But, since I have not found them and I need them kind
of urgently, I am taking a shortcut, i.e., getting answers from people who are more familiar with DMDX.

The first question is: Can DMDX take IF...THEN command to control the kind of operations to be performed? I want to sound a warning
signal for the subject if his/her reaction time exceeds a preset deadline. I want to do this but still obtain the actual reaction
time.  Can someone tell me how this can be done?

The second question is: Is there a way, and how, to output the experimenter specified information to a file whose data structure can
be matched with that of the data file that DMDX creates? In conjunction with the RT data, I want to be able to store all the codes
that define the experimental condition of a trial, together with the stimuli that are shown on that trial.

Thanks in advance to all who offer answers to these questions.
