==============================================================================

The vibrating eyes of jumping spiders have inspired a new breed of vision
sensors that could give the next generation of Mars rovers sharper eyesight,
say researchers in California. As a result, the roving robots will need less
computing power, so they'll be much lighter and will use less electricity.

Today's robot-vision systems sense images focused onto an array of picture
elements on a microchip. Each picture element, or pixel, is generated by a
photoreceptor that converts light intensity into an electrical signal. The
sensors generate huge quantities of data many times per second-so they need
complex computer circuitry to process the information. But this adds weight.

To cut down on the processing power required, Oliver Landolt, Ania Mitros and
their colleagues at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena are
turning to nature for help. Biologists have long known that the tropical
jumping spider vibrates its thin, long retina back and forth to see more
clearly than would otherwise be possible.

Landolt and his colleagues wondered whether vibrating an electronic image
sensor could also create sharper images. So they built an array comprising 32
rows of 32 pixels each on a silicon image-sensor chip and clamped a metal
frame onto it. Next, they mounted a lens inside the frame, attached by four
springs. The lens focuses an image onto the chip. When the unit is shaken, the
lens starts vibrating at the springs' resonant frequency-about 300
hertz-moving the image over the pixels.

The distance from the lens to the surface of the chip never changes, so the
image is always in focus. The net effect is as if each pixel is moving
elliptically, sampling a larger area of the image than if it were stationary.
Each pixel generates a train of digital pulses from which a signal processor
extracts features of the image-using knowledge of the position of the springs.

To see why moving pixels are better than stationary ones, consider the line
that signals a transition from light to darkness. Immobile pixels can only
tell that the transition is somewhere in between them. But if the pixels are
moving, they cover the region between them, and will detect precisely where
the change in light intensity occurs.

Although smaller than a matchbox, the vibrating sensor's images are almost as
sharp as those of an immobile sensor with 256 by 256 pixels, says Landolt.
"This is a good start to doing interesting things with a robot, such as
finding where a door is, or identifying the orientation of edges between light
and darkness."

Christopher Assad, who works on biologically inspired planetary robots at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, agrees. "This would be great,"
he says. "The really elegant part that I like is that if you mount this on a
small rover, the rover's going to have vibrations just from its movements and
you can use that wasted energy to power the sensor's movements. It's a very
elegant way to win big on power and allow you to do smart imaging."
