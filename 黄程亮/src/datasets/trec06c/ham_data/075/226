Sir,
  
Subj: Financial support for education and rural
development of tribal community.
        
Greeting from Vanavasi Ashram!
Vanavasi Ashram trust is running a residential tribal
school at Periya, Wayanad, Kerala, India for the last
four years. We started the school in May 1997 with 47
tribal children and now there are 207 of them
studying.
                     The chairman of the trust is a
retired university Professor and the trustees include
three tribal Chieftains, one medical practioner, one
lady teacher and a retired school teacher(the
Secretary).
              Temporary buildings are constructed for
school hostels using locally available materials with
the financial support of well wishers. The local
tribal community is also participating in the
construction of buildings and agricultural activities
whenever needed.
               We are following the 'gurukula' system
of education where teachers and students stay together
as in a family. Agriculture, stitching and tailoring,
carpentry work, basket making, book binding, yoga and
music etc are also part of the school syllabus. Paddy,
pulses, bananas and vegetables are grown by students
and teachers in the land of the trust. 
 Significant change has come in the attitude of the
tribal community towards education and health care.
Our senior students participate in rural development
activities of the area.
             This place is surrounded by Reserve
Forest on all four sides. Ninety five percentage of
the population belongs to tribal community namely,
Kuruchiyas, Paniyas, Kurumas, Kattunaikas and Adiyars.
During raining season, the village is isolated as
there is no proper road facility. Drinking water which
we get from the forest through country pipes often get
disrupted by wild animals. But in summer we experience
scarcity of water. 
   In the above circumstances we need financial
support for the following :
