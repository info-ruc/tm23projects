I saw you loggend in tty1 and tried calling but no one answered.  I do not
know if you are transferring files to the raid right now, but I copied the
exact same file that you did today again to psc1 and it took 1.5 mins for
the 100 MB or so.  I then did a cp to move it from /home to
/net/pscr1/BLAHBLAH and in 50 mins it had barely copied 15 MB.  That is not
good, at all.  I also must ssh to some other machine first, then ssh to
psc1, so it is not the ssh ( the bbftp goes from psc1 to bbftp.jlab.org
without going through your ssh connection to gpg1).  I think it is slow from
psc1 to pscr1, but I have no idea why. I will look into it tonight.  I spoke
to Adnan yesterday.  I will start training him this week, maybe even today.
He can borrow the books up there right?  Also, I will give him an acct on
physxcd.  Do you want him to have an acct on psc1 and/or root on physxcd
right now or wait a little while or is it my call?  I went there Wed but
none of you were there, but I will try to find you sometime this week again.
I will email you on any discoveries on the pscr1 thing.  For now, if you can
fit the data files in psc1 you might just want to copy the file(s) there???
