 ESnet,
 
 We have intermittent connectivity problems between Jefferson Lab 
 (jlabs1.jlab.org) and the University of Richmond (psc1.richmond.edu):
 
 ----psc1.richmond.edu PING Statistics----
 105 packets transmitted, 42 packets received, 60% packet loss
 round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max = 79/82/89
 ----psc1.richmond.edu PING Statistics----
 14 packets transmitted, 11 packets received, 21% packet loss
 round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max = 80/82/89
 
 Could you take a look?
 
 Thank you,
 Sandy Philpott
