Hi Deneyse and Chris,

An engineer and space enthusiast, Patrick McGrath, stopped by the office 
while he was in the Frear Building on other business.  (His keychain holds 
an "Embrace Space" tag.)  He asked me to pass on the information about the 
bulletin boards to you.

Best wishes,
Geraldine

>Dear Ms. Russel,

>I was very pleased to meet and speak with you about the Spage Grant 
>Consortium this morning.  As promised, the following are Web addresses of 
>two bulletin board services dedicated (more or less) to Space Science.
>
>The first is operated (and allegedly moderated) by MSNBC:
>
>http://bbs.msnbc.com/bbs/msnbc-space/index.asp
>
>As I haphazardly explained in your office, there are as many fringe cases 
>of one sort or another as there are serious space enthusiasts and 
>professionals.  On the other hand, even the strangest posts sometimes make 
>for fun reading!
>
>The second was established by a few of the regulars fromthe MSNBC bulletin 
>board who wanted a refuge from the "Cydonuts", UFO-nuts and others of that 
>ilk.  It is privately moderated and (usually) stays on topic - many of its 
>regular contributors are professionals in the aerospace industry - a 
>couple of them work for NASA.

>Rather than sending a blind email to people I who haven;t met me, I will 
>ask you to linkdly pass on the above URLs to the Churchill's, who are 
>teaching STS 4971 this spring.  They and their students may find both BBSs 
>an interesting public forum in which to share ideas and gain insight.  Of 
>recent special interest on both BBSs: a lengthy discussion, much of it 
>cogent, on the Fermi Paradox, the Drake Equation, and the motivation 
>behind various possible human reactions to a discovery of ETI, should one 
>be made.
>
>Enjoy!
