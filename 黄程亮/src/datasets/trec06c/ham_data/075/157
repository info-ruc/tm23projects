Hi Francisco,

Last summer, before we got the RAID, I got typical speeds of 700 kBytes/s when
copying from jlab to psc1. The best I ever got to pscr1 was ~100 kBytes/s, but
I always assumed that pscr1 was not
the problem. I think you should call raidzone and see what they have to say
about the problem. Like I said before, because of the problem with the web
interface, the way we have pacr1 set up may not be optimum.

Mike
