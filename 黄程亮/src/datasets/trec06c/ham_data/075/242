I have some general suggestions for the draft, as well as a few more
specific comments. I'm not sure if some of these suggestions are
appropriate; it depends on the nature of the article.  I'm assuming that
it is meant to be an overview of future plans/possibilities to address a
set of questions in nuclear physics, and so we will want to covers these
topics broadly (beyond just the particular experiments that we discuss in
detail).

As far as contributions to the paper, I will work with Donal and Werner on
the experimental aspects of x>1, so my contribution will depend on what
work still needs to be done.  In addition, I'm looking into measurements
of nuclear structure functions at Fermilab with high intensity neutrino
beams (for the bright booster study group).  It may be that there would
be complimentary information to be gained from such experiments, which
might be worth mentioning.


General questions/comments:

1. The experiments described have very different levels of experimental
detail included.  I'm assuming that the goal is to have a reasonably
detailed descriptions of the experiments (enough to be convincing from a
feasibility point of view).  Including this with each experiment (as is
done with the vector meson production) would make it difficult to discuss
the experiments as a coherent group of related or complimentary
measurements.  Do we want to break the paper up into a physics overview
for the experiments (to make the overall physics discussion more
coherent), followed by a section with experimental details?  Or is the
idea to focus on just the physics program and just make the minimal
necessary references to the details of the proposed measurements?

2. Since the article presents a general overview of what can be done in
the future, it would probably be worth including at least a brief mention
of what can be done currently (e.g. 6 GeV JLab or elsewhere), as well as
some of the more mundane advantages at higher energies. I can think of two
examples right away (since I'm involved with them).  First is the approved
6 GeV x>1 run which will start do look at some of the things mentioned in
the x>1 section (although largely in the quasielastic region) and which
will look at A/D ratios at 1<x<2 as well as A/3He ratios for 2<x<3 (with
limited Q^2 coverage).  Second is the measurement of the EMC effect, where
there will be new measurements for light nuclei (A=3,4) as well as
increased coverage in x at 11 GeV.  For both x>1 and the EMC effect, these
are not new ideas, but they are a piece of the information we will gain at
JLab at 6 or 11 GeV.  It isn't as new or as interesting as what we can get
from the tagged structure function measurements, but we can at least
mention that these measurements will give us some improved data, and then
go on to the things that will give us something new and different (tagged
measurements, x>1 in the inelastic region...).  I think that it would help
to make the article a better overview of the problems we hope to address
if we include mention of these other measurements, though we don't need
to discuss them in any detail.


A few more specific comments:

CLAS experiments:
Most of the experiments require 11 GeV JLab and current detectors or proposed
upgrades.  One or two things (e.g. tagging the low momentum protons in CLAS)
involve a new detector.  We probably don't need to get into the details of
these detectors (if we don't want to), but it would be good to make some
comment/reference to what would be needed, and what part they would play
in an expanded or modified measurement.

X>1: There are additional data points for figure 4 from 89-008.  They are
on my web page, but I'll actually generate points at x=1 and 1.5, so that
they can be included in the figure.

Color Transparency: Fig 11 can be updated with final JLab 99 results.
Also, since the points stayed about the same but with much smaller errors,
we may want different models (i.e. maybe replace the top one, which appears to
be ruled out).  Finally, for my information, what are the light and dark points
on figures 12/13, and what are the two cross section ratios being plotted?
