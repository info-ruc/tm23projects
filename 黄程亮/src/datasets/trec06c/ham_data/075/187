Message Subject: bbftp problems

Message Body:
Hi,
 
    I have been trying to transfer files from JLab to the University
 of Richmond during the last couple of days and failing. The
 problem is the following.
 
 1. I am using bbftp to transfer files from the CLAS work disk at
 /work/clas/disk3/gilfoyle to Richmond.
 
 2. I can transfer small files without difficulty.
 
 3. When i try to transfer large DST files (actually only about
 78 MBytes per file) the connection times out and I get stuff like
 the following.
 
 psc1:data> bbftp -u gilfoyle -i bbftpctrl bbftp.jlab.org
 Password (max length = 8192):

 The bbftp control file I was using is below.
 
 psc1:data> more bbftpctrl
 cd /work/clas/disk3/gilfoyle/
 get run17469.a00prod19.rzn
 get run17469.a01prod19.rzn
 get run17469.a02prod19.rzn
 get run17469.a03prod19.rzn

 get run17469.a05prod19.rzn
 get run17469.a06prod19.rzn
 get run17469.a07prod19.rzn
 get run17469.a08prod19.rzn
 get run17469.a10prod19.rzn
 
 
 4. This occurs even when I try data transfers late at night (around
 11:30 pm)
 
 5. I tried registering this problem with CCPR and I get a message
 'Unable to locate the server mis.jlab.org'.
 
 Thanks-in-advance for your help.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Jerry Gilfoyle
