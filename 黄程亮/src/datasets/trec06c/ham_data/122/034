It is probably a truism in biology to state that structures determine
functions over the ontogenetic time scale (seconds to years) and functions
select structures over the phylogenetic time scale (centuries to billions
of years):

How functions select structures seems well understood in terms of the
Darwinian notion of the environment-initiated selection of the fittest
reproducing systems.   The purpose of this post is to discuss possible
mechanisms underlying the causal relation between structure and function
on the most basic level possible, namely, at the molecular and cellular
levels.  At this level, the problem of coupling structure and function is
known as genotype-phenotype coupling: i.e., the question as to how genes
control cell functions or the behaviors of the cell. During the past
century, we have learned a lot about how genes control cell functions,
which can be summarized as shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2.  Molecular mechanisms  underlying genotype-phenotype coupling.

The overall process of the genotype-phenotype coupling can be divided into
four distinct subprocesses as shown above.  Of these the first three are
well-known: 1 =  transcription, 2 = translation , and 3 = catalysis. 
However, the fourth process is not yet well established, because it has
not yet been well investigated experimentally due to the difficulty
inherent in studying OPCP, dynamic structures maintained by continuous
dissipation of free energy.  That OPCPs do occur inside the living cell,
however, is beyond doubt. One of the first clear demonstration of this was
provided by D. W. Sawyer et al  in 1985 [1] who was able to visualize the
calcium ion gradient formed within moving human white blood cells known as
neutrophils, using a dye molecule whose fluorescence efficiency increases
upon binding calcium ions.  Their measurements clearly revealed that the
direction of movement (better known as chemotaxis) of neutorophils  is
determined by the orientation of the calcium ion gradient inside the cell
(i.e., the structure of OPCPs). Unlike the intracellular calcium ion
gradients driving neutrophil migration, which are chemical concentration
gradients in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space (requiring x, y and z
coordinates for specification),  the intracellular  mRNA levels recently
measured by Perez-Ortin and his group in Valencia, Spain [2] provides an
example of a chemical concentration gradient in the time dimension.  That
is,  the intracellular concentrations of mRNA molecules can change with
respect to time – rising of falling within minutes to hours, depending on
the nucleotide sequences of  mRNA molecules involved.  What is most
significant is that these temporal gradients of mRNA molecules are
associated with activation or inhibition of those cell functions catalyzed
by the proteins encoded in the mRNA molecules, thereby linking OPCPs to
cell functions.

So we have here two examples--one involving spatial gradients of chemical
concentrations and the other temporal gradients--that clearly demonstrate
the causal connection (in the form of a 1-to-1 correlation) between OPCPs
and cell functions.  This  provides the possible mechanism for
effectuating the fourth subprocess shown in Figure 2.

It is important to point out that OPCPs in Figure 2 (as exemplified by the
spatial gradients of calcium ions [1] and the temporal gradients of mRNA
[2]) cannot exist without continuous dissipation of free energy, just as
the flame of a candle cannot be maintained without continuous combustion
of hydrocarbons at the wick. Such dynamic structures,  which disappear
upon removing free energy input, were named “dissipative structures” by I.
Prigogine (1917-2003) [3-5]   As is well known, he was awarded the 1977
Nobel Prize in Chemistry or Physiology for his pioneering work on
establishing the concept of dissipative structures in nonequilibrium
thermodynamics [5].  He believed that the living cell was a dissipative
structure [6], which is by now another truism in biology.

We can now replace the operationally defined term OPCPs in Figure 2 with
the thermodynamics-based concept of the so-called ‘intracellular
dissipative structures’ (IDSs)’ [7,8] as shown in Figure 3.

Processes 1 and 2 in Figure 3 are clearly catalyzed by enzymes and Process
3 is also mediated by enzymes.  Process 4 may be viewed as an “Identity
Process”, in analogy to the “identity operator’ in algebra, in the sense
that IDSs are correlated to cell functions in a 1-to-1 manner.  That is,
IDSs ARE cell functions. Since all enzymes and effector proteins are
postulated to be driven by internal mechanical stresses localized in
sequence-specific sites called conformons [9], it can be suggested that
Processes 1 through 4 (and also Processes 5 through 7) are all driven by
conformons generated within enzymes catalyzing them.  The molecular model
of the living cell based on the concepts of conformons and dissipative
structures are named the Bhopalator in 1985 [7,8].

Figure 3.  A molecular model of the genotype-phenotype coupling based on
the concepts of dissipative structures and conformons.  This is an
alternative representation of the molecular model of the living cell known
as the Bhopalator [7,8].

In conclusion, it may be stated that the Bhopalator model of the living
cell formulated two decades ago may provide molecularly realistic
mechanisms for effectuating the genotype-phenotype coupling, the holy
grail of modern cell biology.  If this theoretical analysis proves to be
valid upon further investigation, the Bhopalator may provide a useful
molecular theoretical framework for ushering in a new era of functional
genomics on the molecular level.

With all the best.
