Hello,

I am having problems when I try to set up timedx, I receive the message:

"Directx reports no support for Page Flipping
The video card in this machine is not adequate for DMDX'x
purposes"

I have a Nvidia geforce4 MX 4000 video card and a pentium 4 PC. I
would be very thankful for any kind of help on this.
I thank you very much in advance,
Maria Luiza
