GRID
Physiology of the Grid

the authors define an Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) that supports
the creation, management and invocation of stateful, transient services as
named entries with dynamic lifetimes.

Merits of this service-oriented model are as follows:
All components of the environment are virtualized. Virtualization brings
to the table a large number of advantages such as composition of services
regardless of implementation, management of resources across heterogeneous
platforms with local or remote transparency  and the ability to map common
service semantic behavior seamlessly onto native platform facilities.

It evolves the Globus toolkit using a number of components such as
"gatekeeper", Meta Directory Service, and Grid Security Infrastructure.

the underlying Web Services framework supports in dynamic discovery of
services and nescessiates mechanisms for registering and discovering
interface definitions and endpoint implementation descriptions.


different Virtual Organization (VO) structures:
Simple Hosting Environment : consists of a single administrative domain
and supporting native facilities for service management

Virtual Hosting Environment : VOs dealing with multiple heterogeneous
environments require another higher layer to delegate requests to the
lower level

Collective Operations : Virtual Hosting Environments which provides VO
participants with more sophisticated or collective end-to-end services.

each Grid Service Request results in creation of a grid service instance
with some initial lifetime. the user application is required to generate
"keepalive" requests to the Grid Service that it has created. the lifetime
of a request can be extended by a client though granting such a request is
not mandatory.

the network protocol must provide reliable transport, authentication and
delegation, ubiquity and the GSR format into consideration.

Higher level services must include distributed data management services,
workflow services, auditing services, instrumentation and monitoring
services and security mapping services.



P2P and Grid Computing

both the systems deal with resource sharing in virtual communities.

Comparisons:

Grids generally deal with more sophisticated/complex services and
application while P2P evolved initially around file sharing applications.

there exists a certain amount of trust and co-operation amongst Grid
participants while P2P users have little incentive to act cooperatively.

Resource availability tends to be higher and more uniform in the Grid System.

Although the number of participating entries in P2P is much higher, the
amount of data transferred is much more in Grid based systems (maybe due
to better resources)


the authors suggest combining the elements of Grid and P2P computing for
better computing in the future.
