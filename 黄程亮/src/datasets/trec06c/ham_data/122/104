LA/7753 Recommendations of the investigative commission 

The investigative commission on Israel/Palestine was established by resolution of the special council meeting held in May 2005, and asked to report to council in 2006. The policy on international greylisting and boycotts unanimously agreed by the commission for recommendation to council is set out in this circular. This paper relates to the AUT council meeting on 10-12 May 2006; LA secretaries are asked to forward this link to council members. A hard copy of this paper will also be included in the direct mailing to delegates registered to attend the meeting. (4 pages)

AUT Council, 10-12 May 2006 

  

Registration 

Information on arrangements and registration for the 2006 AUT council meeting were set out in LA/7745, issued last month and LA secretaries/administrators were asked to coordinate their delegations and register delegates and observers by Tuesday 18 April. A number of LAs have not yet registered delegates and you are reminded to do so as soon as possible. An online registration form is available at https://asp.artegis.com, (Login: AUT2006/Password: LASEC2006) (both case-sensitive). When registering delegates online, LAs are asked to complete the confirmation code section at the bottom of the form with the code LACOCONF06 to ensure that we know that delegates have been nominated to attend by their LA. 

  

Alternatively, a hard copy registration form can be downloaded from the AUT website at http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/p/7/council06_regform.pdf or is available from Sonia Vitarana (sonia.vitarana@aut.org.uk) at AUT HQ. 

  

Hotel bookings 

The Scarborough Accommodation Bureau has also notified me that hotel bookings also remain low. An online booking form and hotel information on hotels offering preferential rates if booked via the accommodation bureau are available at https://www.conferencebookings.co.uk/delegate?EventRef=SCBAUT2006. You are advised to book as soon as possible to ensure that your hotel choice is available. 

  

  

Links to new circulars are sent to LA secretaries and administrators. If the address to which this email has been sent is not correct, or for any other changes in the details of local association officers and contacts please email mailto: hq@aut.org.uk
