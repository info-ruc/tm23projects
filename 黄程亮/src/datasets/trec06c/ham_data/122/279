I agree.  And the processes underlying the evolution of biology on this
planet are more akin to Wolfram's recursively applied simple
rules/programs than the physics-inspired engineering programs that sent
humans to the moon.

I too admit of a top-down component (e.g., a Vietnamese monk burning
hiself to death in a political protest in the late 1960's) but I think
such an phenomenon is confined to specail, rare systems (such as
disciplined Buddhist monks) and not universally occurecnes. In contrast,
the bottom-up processes that I was discussing are all universal. 
Generalizing, then, I wonder if we can assert the following:

    "Bottom-up is universal but top-down is local/specific."           (1)

>Further, to be consistent, I assert that chemistry
>harnesses physical posibilities in ITS interests.

I disagree.  Raw chemistry, without being associated with specific
material structures, cannot harness nor constrain physics.  Rather it is
the other way round: Chemistry is a subbranch of physics in that it
implements only a subset of the laws of physics.

This may be because the "locality" or "specificity" increases as one goes
up in the hierarchy, thus agreeing with the dictum stated in (1) above.

I am not a reductionist.  I am a 'complimentarian' who belives in the
complementarity between reductionism and holism.  That is, I believe that
both reductionism and holism are necessary for a complete understanding of
reality and life. W. Elsasser, toward the end of his book, "Reflections on
a Theory of Organisms: Holism in Biology" (the Johns Hopkins University
Press, Baltimore, available from Amazon for about $18) expressed a similar
idea, although he did not use the term "complimentarian".

With all the best.
