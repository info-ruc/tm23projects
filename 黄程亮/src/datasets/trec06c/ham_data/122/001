TD has received the long awaited increased Internet circuit from Sprint.
We will be performing an emergency maintenance today at 12:00 noon to
migrate to the circuit. During this time, users will experience a brief
drop in Internet connectivity.

We greatly appreciate the University community’s cooperation and
patience over these last few months.
