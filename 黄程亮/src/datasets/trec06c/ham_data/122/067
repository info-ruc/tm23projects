I can see that, sinc eyou need x, y, z and t coordinates to specify each
of the 'hierarchons' constituting a scale hierarchy.

No.  I was not thinking that, although one could, which woul dmake the
hierarchy more complex.

Generally speaking, we can allow any node of a basic tree hierarchy (e.g.,
the hierarchy 1-4-7 above) to be a hierarchy, thus leading to a recursive
definition of the hierarchy: A hierarchies of hierarchies of hierarchies 
. . . .

>As well, are you

Again, I was not thinking such a possibility originally, but I think we
can accommodate this idea as well, within the framework of the basic tree
hierachy shown above.  For example, we can specify that certain of the
edges will have a defined lifetime: Edge 1-2 may dissolve after say time
t.  For the same token, new edges may be allowed to form at a certain
time, t', say, between nodes 3 and 4, making them tetravalent after t'. 
In this manner, we can use a tree hierarchy to represent temporal logic as
well.

I understand what you are trying to say here, but I am not sure if I can
agree with your notion of "biology harnessing chemsitry".  I don't think
biology harness chemistry at all.  Biology only obeys chemistry, i.e.,
chemistry seems to have a mind of its own, behaving in the same way
regardless of whether it is inside the cell or out in the depth of an
ocean.  So, in this sense, we can just as confidently say that chemistry
harnesses biology.  I agree that chemistry is a necessary condition for
biology but not sufficient.  But if we take into account both chemistry
AND the physics of the environment under which organisms have evolved,
then I think we have a sufficient condition for biology: Biology is the
natural consequence of chemistry (responsible for giving rise to all
possible configuraions of chemicals) and environment (which selects,
obeying the laws of physics, certain of the possible chemical
configruations because of their ability to self-reproduce under a given
environment).

I do not bilieve that biology imposes order on chemistry.  Rather biology
results inevitably from the vast variety of material configurations
afforded by chemistry and the selecting power of the environment.  In
other words, biology can be viewed as a coincidence dtector (of
conicidence detectors):

                           ______________
          Chemistry --- > |  Organisms   |
                          |      as      |
                          | Coincidence  | ----- > Biology
          Physics ----->  |  Detectors   |
                          |______________|


  Figure A.  Biology as the inevitable consequence of the coincidence
             between the right Chemsitry and the right Physics of the
             Environment. In other words, organisms can be viewed as
             coincidence detectors of the right Chemistry and the right
             Physics of the environment.
