PROJECT FAQ

     1) Command to turnin your project files

     turnin --submit madhavi project <file>

     2) The cache simulator should implement "write back" policy. So, the
     data
     in the cache is written back into the memory only when the block is
     replaced. You need not flush the cache after the entire trace has been
     processed.
     So, it is valid to have new data in the cache and old data in the
     memory.

     3) The memory is byte-addressable. But, the trace files will have
     addresses that are word aligned. Also, the memory initialization is
     done
     for 4 bytes at a time.

     You can view the memory as a array of 1 megawords. Each entry is 32
     bits(4
     bytes= 1 word).

     Entry 0 - address 0 - initialized to 0
     Entry 1 - address 4 - initialized to 4
     Entry 2 - address 8 - initialized to 8
     Entry 3 - address c - initialized to c
     Entry 4 - address 10 - initialized to 10
     ..
     ..

     You need to initialize all the words (1 megawords) in the memory. But,
     you
     will print out only words from 1000 to 11fc.
     NOTE: The range given in handout #2 was incorrect. I have corrected it
     now.

Cheers,

Madhavi
