Dear Friend,

 

RE: COLLECTION OF FUND (US$15,900,000.00) UNDER SPECIAL 

ARRANGEMENT.


Pardon me if I have offended you by contacting you for such a big transaction through an ordinary letter which makes it suspicious considering the type of fraud proposals moving around the world today. However, I was advised to explain this transaction to you on a face to face meeting. I could not do this because of the situation in the world today not being sure of your reaction.


I am Bobby Miguel Kim, a Consultant and Broker from Kingston Jamaica. I was hired by a Japanese Businessman to broke an investment deal between him and  an oil company in Venezuela. This deal was executed in January, 1997 and matured for termination in January 2001. On maturity, the Japanese Businessman and the oil firm decided to terminate the investment in cash to avoid payment of investment tax which amounted to several tens of millions of US Dollars to the American Internal Revenue Service (IRS). A special arrangement was made between a top Japanese banker working with Japanese bank in New York, the Oil company and the businessman to terminate the investment in cash payment under a fictitious name, with an arrangement to change it later with a power of attorney which they prepared and handed over to the banker.

 

I was directly involved, well paid and mandated to organized and carry 

out the deal. All the cash was withdrawn in August 2001 and transported 

to Europe by direct bank vault delivery to a private diplomatic storage 

in Europe for safekeeping pending the collection.

The real content of the boxes was not declared to the storage as it was delivered as personal family treasure and diamonds.The codes for the storage, secret codes for the opening of the boxes and its keys were all handed over to me.


Mr. Takashi the New York businessman was planning to go to Europe by 

mid November 2001 with me for the collection when the unexpected happened in Sept 9/11 attacks on the twin tower which claimed his life and that of the top banker. This left me devastated and confused as I have not yet handed over the deposit details to the owner and the power of attorney prepared for the change which was signed was still with the banker in his office which was lost.

It was agreed with the storage that the consignment would be collected 

on or before 12 months from the date of delivery. Since last December, 

the diplomatic storage manager has been calling me to bring or tell the 

owner to come over for collection. Since then,


I have been finding any reliable person  to collect these consignments under special and well negotiated arrangement until I came across your details.Be rest assured that this transaction has been well organised, 100% safe, legal, risk free and should be kept very confidential.signify your interest by contacting me via my private Email:isaacgrillo_1@yahoo.co.uk


Kind Regards,

Bobby Miguel Kim.
