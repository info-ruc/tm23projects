CS352-ers,

I have a couple of comments about the project, which I also announced 
today in class.

1) The due date has been extended to May 4, 2006 (in class).

2) We have posted a third project handout at the location below.  This 
document outlines the
experiments you need to perform as well as the project deliverables 
(both electronic and hardcopy)
