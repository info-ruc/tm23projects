VLBI project BB223, at 2270 MHz, with the VLBA,
Arecibo, and the GBT, was completed.
Everything seemed to be working ok.
All scans were recorded.

Phase cals were about 5%; Tsys about 25K.
The weather was mostly clear.

The last few scans, from 0644 to 0700 UT,
appear to be marked as "offsource" in the
log data, but the GBT was really
onsource for those scans.

Tapes VLBA0833 and DSCP0040 were shipped to Socorro yesterday.
