	The first paper, "On Death, Taxes, and the Convergence of
Peer-to-Peer and Grid Computing," compares and contrasts peer-to-peer
technology and grid computing. The authors point out differences in
the two technologies in their incentive, resources, application,
scale, and services that they provided. The target communities are
different in the two technologies. In Grid, it is targeted toward
scientific computing and business use whereas in P2P it is targeted to
diverse and anonymous individual. Therefore, in Grid resource is
usually well managed, powerful and available most of the time, and
they don't have as much scalability and resilience to failure as P2P.
In Grid, the services that they provide are usually persistent and
multipurpose whereas in P2P it provides very specific simple services
such as file-sharing. Although they are different in many aspects,
they both try to solve similar problem which is the sharing of
resource within virtual communities. Finally, it concludes that that
the two communities are approaching each other over time.
	The second paper, "The Physiology of the Grid," present an Open Grid
Services Architecture that integrate services across distributed,
heterogeneous, and dynamic resources from "virtual organization". This
paper focuses on three aspects of how a Grid functions, can be
implemented and applied. First, it views Grid as an extensible set of
Grid services that can be aggregated to achieve the need of various
"Virtual Organization." Second, it uses Globus Toolkit to define WSDL
interfaces for a Grid services, such as lifetime management,
notification, policy management, credential management and
virtualization. Finally, they focus on using Grid in commercial
setting instead of scientific computing, in which it needs to support
integration with existing resources and applications.
