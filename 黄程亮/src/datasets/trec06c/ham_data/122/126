    The Physiology of the Grid
    Ian Foster, Carl Kesselman, Jeffrey M. Nick, Steven Tuecke
    Similar to the Death and Taxes paper, rather than exploring the
differences and similarities between peer to peer and grid systems, this
paper focuses on the technical specifications of grid systems and
applications. It presents the Globus toolkit and web services, along with a
bevy of buzzwords, which are real and implemented technologies that work
together to permit interoperability of disparate services. The ultimate
point of this work is to permit virtual organizations to cohere; in other
words, to allow individual entities to negotiate efficiently how to
communicate with each other. The Grid service is represented as a sort of
server that operates in many ways as a kernel, providing service handles to
client processes via invocations to default portions of the Grid service
that are themselves handles.

    On Death, Taxes, and the Convergence of Peer-to-Peer and Grid Computing
    Ian Foster, Adriana Iamnitchi
    Grid computing is a different approach to resource sharing across
networks, with different foci and assumptions that determine their target
audiences. The differrence between this and P2P is the degree of
centralization and location of control, in that peer to peer systems tend t=
o
be allergic to centralization, where Grid Computing tries to use its
resources as efficiently as possible, while accepting centralized control.
Grid applications focus on large organizations supplying resources and make=
s
more assumptions about security, trust, and up-time. Grid computing also is
concerned with providing standardized interfaces to allow generalized
resource sharing, where Peer to Peer systems focus on vertically integrated
solutions to specific resource sharing issues.

    Breaking standard form, this final paragraph comments on both papers.
They are somewhat content free, providing descriptions of real systems that
are separate architectures in and of themselves, but which do not
necessarily add up to the suggested technology. Grid permits the sharing of
resources, but there is so much noise and so much tinsel that it is hard to
see exactly where this occurs; the heavy lifting seems to be done by other,
less exalted technologies.
