   Then you sure don't want <d 0> in your parameter line as that's just as 
fast as DMDX can go plus 2 ticks.  It might work out to be 2 ticks if your 
machine is fast enough but there's no guaranteed timing with a delay of zero.

   Not really, you're not asking for rigid timing so DMDX is at liberty to 
do as it pleases.

   You will have to have another frame after the feedback, usually this 
will be a blank frame to erase the feedback.

999 d2 "Time Out" <% 30> / <return>;

   Note this will add another tick and above the time of the feedback.
