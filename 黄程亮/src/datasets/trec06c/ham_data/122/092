The Physiology of the Grid
On Death, Taxes, and the Convergence of Peer-to-Peer and Grid Computing

The Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) is designed to provide a method to pool resources and create "virtual organizations" out of heterogeneous platforms.  The OGSA model is closely modeled on, and in some ways an extension or evolution of, web services and current uses of the Globus toolkit.  OGSA proposes conventions by which services can be described, advertised, and interoperate.  The service oriented model is slightly different previous work that tended to focus on physical resources.  The example provided in the paper bases service descriptions on WSDL (although it is mentioned that other approaches may also be feasible.)  The system allows for different platforms and languages to be used to create the actual services.  A number of standard interfaces are defined that may be provided by a grid service.  There are provisions to create temporary services and to destroy them.  Much as with web services, a client will contact a service provider and obtain information about the services that it provides.  Then, the client can authenticate if necessary and create an instance of the service that it requires.  The service provider will perform functions that are invoked and respond to the client when necessary.  Grid service instances are given a unique Grid service handle (GSH) and this has an associated Grid service reference.  While the GSH is constant, the GSR is dynamic and can be changed to reflect upgrades or changes to the service.  As with selecting the platform and language to run a service on, OGSA also allows for different network protocols to be used depending on the requirements of the application.

P2P and Grid network computing are shown to have many similar properties, but with slightly different focuses.  Both P2P networks and Grid computing seek to organize resources across virtual organizations, but P2P network development has focused on failure while Grid development has focused on infrastructural issues.  The paper argues that these properties are complementary, and thus there will be an inevitable convergence of the technologies.  The authors argue that up to now, the divergence in development has been spurred by different user communities and uses for Grid and P2P networks.  Grid computing has largely focused on the scientific community and pooling the resources of relatively well connected, powerful machines for computational purposes.  P2P networks have focused on average Internet users and applications such as file sharing, but connecting weaker, less reliably-linked machines.  Nonetheless, as these services continue to develop and provide new functionality, their development goals are beginning to converge.

OGSA provides a fairly high-level specification of a network and an extremely ambitious goal for it.  The biggest problem with OGSA might be that the developers seem to be "over-planning" and in some ways counting their chickens before they hatch.  It is not clear if it is really possible to develop a system with the goal of perhaps becoming as popular as the world wide web has become.  Furthermore, while they propose some applications for using OGSA, there is no presentation of a real "killer application."  The paper on the convergence of P2P and Grid computing offers an interesting observation, but perhaps could benefit for more specific examples of adapting features offered by P2P networks to Grids or vice-versa.  The paper stops at a very high level discussing the topic at a fairly general level.
