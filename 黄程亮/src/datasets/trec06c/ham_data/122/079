<OGSA>
* The Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) describes an architecture for a service-oriented grid computing environment. OGSA, based on several other web service technologies, aims to be largely agnostic in relation to the transport-level handling of data.
* Basically, OGSA is a distributed interaction and computing architecture based around services, assuring interoperability on heterogeneous systems so that different types of resources can communicate and share information.
* OGSA extends the earlier article "The Anatomy of Grid" that defines Grid technologies as supporting the resource sharing in distributed virtual organizations (VOs) in three respects.
(i) It focuses on the nature of services that respond to protocol messages. Here Grid is regarded as an extensible set of Grid services, services that conform to a set of conventions and support lifetime management, discovery of characteristics and so on.
(ii) It shows how Grid technologies can be aligned with web services technologies. The Web Service Description Language (WSDL) is used here to achieve self-describing services and interoperable protocols.
(iii) It discusses the commercial applications rather than scientific applications of this architecture.
* It is worth noting that all components in the Grid environment are virtualized. Virtualization of this model enables mapping common service semantic behavior seamlessly onto native platform facilities.

<Peer-to-Peer and Grid Computing>
* This paper compares and contrasts peer-to-peer and grid computing. It arrives at four conclusions.
(i) Peer-to-peer and grid computing both are concerned with the pooling and coordinated use of distributed resources within virtual communities.
(ii) Peer-to-peer and grid computing both are constructed as overlay structures that operate independently of institutional relationships.
(iii) Peer-to-peer computing addresses failure but not yet the infrastructure where as grid computing addresses infrastructure but not yet the failure.
(iv) Because of their commonalities and complementary strengths and weaknesses mentioned above, they are likely to grow close over time.
