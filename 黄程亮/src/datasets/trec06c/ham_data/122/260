The CCOF system is designed to support the wide variety of
applications which wish to take advantage of the spare cycles
available on many computers.  The authors have divided these
applications into several different types, which require different
scheduling algorithms.  First, there are infinite workload
applications, where there is a huge pile of data to be processed, and
no set deadline for completion.  Second, there are similar projects
which wish to analyze large quantities of data, but have deadlines the
data must be analyzed by.  Third are tree-based search applications,
which assign different sections of the problem to different slave
nodes, which must communicate with each other to share new
discoveries.  Finally, there are point-of-presence applications, where
not many CPU cycles are used, but the slave nodes should be scattered
across the network.

Schedulers for two of these types of projects are presented.  For
infinite workload applications, a wave scheduling protocol puts the
nodes into a CAN-based DHT, where one of the dimensions is timezone,
and then work is sent to those computers for which is it currently
nighttime.  For point-of-presence applications, a couple of possible
schemes to elect leaders which will cover the network from the pool of
slave nodes.

Seti@Home is a system designed to distribute the cost of analyzing
radio signals across a large number of computers with unused cycles.
The amount of data which needs to be sent is small in comparison to
the amount of analysis which is needed, making the bandwidth costs
reasonable.
