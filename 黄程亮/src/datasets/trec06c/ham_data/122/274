What is so surprising about this?  To me this is no more surprising than
the pine trees painted on walls of a temple (by some well-known Buddhist
monk painter in Korea centuries ago) so realistically that they fooled
birds (if not humans)to their death.  The mechanisms of producing painted
trees and real trees are vastly different, as are the mechanisms by which
Wolfram produced turbulence on the computer screen and real turbulence is
generated in flowing rivers.

After your comments, I went back and examined the 5 rules (on p. 378 of
Wolframs book, A New Kind of Science, 2002) more carefully and came away
with the impression that these rules qualtitatively refelcted the laws of
the conservation of momentum. In other words, these rules seem to capture
some (but not all) aspects of the real laws of physics and are not totally
arbitrary. Similar remaks can be made about the simpe rules or programs 
that reproduced the shapes of shells so realistically on p. 416 of the
above book.

Perhaps all we need to do is to accept the hypothesis that, just as there
are models that are sensitively dependent on initial conditions, so there
may be models that are relatively insensitive to initial conditions.  That
is, just as we have "sensitive dependence on initial conditions (SDIC)" in
deterministic chaos, we may have "insensitive dependence on initial
conditions (IDIC)" as well.

I think Wolfram might have discovered the phenomenon of what we may refer
to as "insensitive dependence on initial conditions" in his NKS.  In fact
he did discuss several examples of IDIC, although he did not call them as
such.

It is not exactly engineering, because most of the time Wolfram does not
know in advance what he would get with a set of simple rules recursively
applied n times, where n can be up to millions.  This contrast with
engineers who know exactly what they would get if their programs/blue
prints are implemented even JUST ONCE in real world.

With all the best.
