Dear Stephen,

Sorry for my  late reply.
You may be interested in looking up the following papers:

1.  C. W. McClare (1974).  Resonance in Bioenergetics. Ann. N. Y. Acad.
Sci. 227:74-97.

2.  Li, K. H., and Popp, P. A. (1990).  Dynamics of DNA Excited States. 
In: Molecular and Biological Physics of Living Systems (Mishra, R. K.),
Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht.  Pp. 3-52.

Good luck.

Sung
