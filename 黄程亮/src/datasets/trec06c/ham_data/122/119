Yeah, that sounds like maybe your adapter driver isn't reporting capabilities correctly. You might want to check the driver version on your machine and compare it to your friend's version if you're curious, but in any case, download the latest driver, especially if you have an NVidia card. I've had various problems with the MS NVidia card drivers which went away as soon as I installed the latest from NVidia.

Also make sure you have an updated version of DirectX. 9.0c is the latest I believe.

Cheers,

Mark

   Not that I've heard about.  The times I've run into this it's either 
been the hardware acceleration slider or the video card wasn't actually 
capable of page flipping -- your card is certainly supposed to be capable 
of page flipping as are all cards made in the last decade.  It's possible 
your card is damaged however it's more likely that the drivers are borked 
and removing the card in the device manager and letting XP detect it again 
on reboot will fix things.
