Of course if you copy someone else's selection and arrangement
uncopyrightable facts you're in trouble. ; -)

Keeping in mind that I am responding only to this very specific and
narrow request and no attorney-client relationship is created by my
response, here it is:



Factual bibliographic and indexing sorts of information are not
protected by copyright.  Under copyright law you do not need permission
to publish (online or anywhere else) a listing of composers, songs,
performers, or other such basic, factual information.



So publish away!

I'm thinking over publishing song titles and artist names on a web site,
on which there also will be commercial advertisements.



It will be like this:



"Songs about love:

I love you - Frank Lovetra

I love you too - Jennifer Lovezz

"



Do I need to get permission for publishing such information? Please note
that the site will be a commercial one, and there will appear
advertisements on the pages with these lists. Also note that lyrics or
the music itself will not be published. Just the titles of the songs and
artists that sing / play / composed them.



Thank you for any replies in advance.
