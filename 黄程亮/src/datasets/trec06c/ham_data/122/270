	The paper, "Cluster Computing on the Fly," presents architecture CCOF
to use up the idle compute cycles in the internet. The authors first
identify the four major classes of cycle-sharing applications, which
include infinite workpile applications, workpile applications with
deadlines, tree-based search application, and point-of-presence
applications. CCOF support two classes of applications, workpile
applications with deadlines and point of presence applications. The
authors observe that the night time idle cycles are more likely to not
be interrupted from users reclaiming their machines. Therefore, CCOF's
Wave Scheduler uses a CAN-based DHT to assign nodes into different
time-zone, and it assigns work to nodes in one of the night-time zone.
The application can also store the results in the DHT when it is not
online. Second, it verifies correctness of results by using two
methods for quizzing hosts. It packets the quizzes into similar packet
as the application code, and sends it from time to time. Or it
includes short quizzes into the application code. The result of the
quizzes can be used to compute trust of a host. Finally, it suggests a
way to schedule nodes for Point-of-Presence applications by using CAN
and Lee distances to elect leaders.
