Hi All,

a student in our department wants to run a reaction time experiment in which
people respond to audio stimuli. When are reaction times recorded in such
cases---from the onset of the audio file or after the file has played? The
audio stimuli she wants to use are single words.



Thanks,


Carrie Ankerstein
