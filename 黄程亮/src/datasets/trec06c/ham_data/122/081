Hello,
I thank you very much for your help. Unfortunately, I have tried to
change hardware acceleration and it didn't work, I keep receiving the
same message:
"Directx reports no support for Page FlippingThe video card in this
machine is not adequate for DMDX'x purposes".
One friend of mine has the same videocard on another computer and
dmdx's runs nicely.
Did anybody have a problem like this?
Thank you again,
Maria Luiza
