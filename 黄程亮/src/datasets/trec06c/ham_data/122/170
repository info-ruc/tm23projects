Email: Smitishvilla@yahoo.com         
               My name is Sherriff Smith and I am an artist.I saw your advert on the web for indicating that you needed part time or full time employment. I live in United Kingdom, with my two kids, four cats, one dog and the love of my life. It is definitely a full house. I have been doing artwork since I was a small child. That gives me about 23 years of experience. I majored in art in high school and took a few college art courses. Most of my work is done in either pencil or airbrush mixed with color pencils. I have recently added designing and creating artwork on the computer. I have been selling my art works for the last 3 years and have had a lot of my works featured on trading cards, prints and in magazines.
 
               I have sold in galleries and to private collectors from all over the world and i get paid without hassles. I am always facing serious difficulties when it comes to selling my art works to Americans,owing to the fact that they mostly offer to pay with a US POSTAL MONEY ORDER, which is difficult for me to cash here in The United Kingdom. And also the cost of coming to the state and getting payments is very expensive,though i am currently working on setting up a branch in the States.
 
               In view of the above i am in urgent need of a representative in the united states who will be handling the payment aspect,by recieving my payments on my behalf from my American clients .It is as a result of the above that we came up with the idea of looking for a responsible and competent person(s) who will be of assistance to me in this area,whom i can entrust my payments upon and who will cash them immediately he/she recieves them and forward the Monies to me here in the U.K via Moneygram Or Western Union International Money Transfer.
          What i need from you is just to recieve the payments and take them to your local bank or check cashing facility and cash them immediately and deduct your own commission. I are prepared to offer a commission of 10% to you persons on any payments recieved and cashed,and i shall increase the commission from time to time based on your competence and efficiency.
         This does not stop you from doing your normal job,it's just for you to take deliveries of payments and cash them and transfer the money to me  here in the U.K via Moneygram Or Western Union International Money Transfer. May i not fail to inform you that you have to assure me  that any payments  you recieve will be instantly cashed and transfered immediately,as i are just starting this set up and i would not like a situation where people will make away ou squander my hard earned money,so please asure me that all will be well in this business arrangement. 
   What the job entails is for you to:
(A) Receive Payments on our Behalf from out American Debtors;such 
payments shall come in the form of Official Checks,Cashiers Checks ,Postal Money 
Orders and Bank drafts,all of which shall be issued in the USA.
(B) Cash such payments
(C) Transfer the monies via Moneygram Or Western Union International 
Money Transfer.
         It wouldn't cost you any amount, You are to receive payments which will be sent to you by fedex or usps courier service from my debtors, which would come in form of a United States Postal Money Order then you are to cash it deduct your own 10% commission and send the balance to me via western union money transfer or money gram money transfer, all transfer fees should be deducted from the money.

       Once I get these details I will forward them from time to time to my clients who will then issue out the payments in your favour and send it to you for cashing.
       This is a completely legal thing in as much as you prove your honesty by acting to instructions,people have made away with my monies in the past and i am trying to be carfeful this time around. You can cash the check wherever you choose,i know they charge commission at the cashing facilities,it's okay if you go cash them there.
