Cluster Computing on the Fly:  P2P Scheduling of Idle Cycles in the Internet
Cluster Computing on the Fly (CCOF) is a system that is designed to take advantage of idle CPU cycles of heterogeneous network members,  The system provides a "quizzing" mechanism to determine trust levels of member nodes.  CCOF also deals with scheduling at the local host level as well as coordinated scheduling across the network.  Some incentives for fairness are considered, but the CCOF model assumes that members are generally "donating" cycles and thus do not necessarily care about cycle-cycle fairness.  

The proposed CCOF implementation is designed to run over CAN.  The CAN network is partitioned into 24 sectors, one for each hour in the day.  When nodes are ready to join the network, perhaps at night when the machine may generally be idle, it will select a node label in the zone corresponding to the current hour.  An application will choose a subset of nodes to farm its workload out to.  When a host leaves the overlay, there is a mechanism to transfer its state to a node that is available in the next zone.  Results can be held in a CAN file system in the event that the application requesting results is offline at the time that work is completed and forwarded at a later time.  

One flaw seen in CCOF is that the authors have not yet dealt with issues relating to DoS attacks and the possibility of malicious users simply scheduling many meaningless tasks to reduce the efficiency of the system.  They offload the difficulty of excluding untrusted nodes to the overlay network, but this has not always been dealt with effectively at that level.
