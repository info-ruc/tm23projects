* This paper presents a P2P scheduling system that aims to utilize the available idle compute cycles throughout the Internet. It encompasses all activities, such as overlay construction, resource discovery, local scheduling, application-level scheduling as well as trust and fairness among peers, which are involved in the management of idle cycles.
* OOCF differs from SETI@home in its 'automatic' scheduling of four classes of cycle-sharing systems: infinite workpile, deadline-driven workpile, tree-based search and point of presence, in an open environment.
