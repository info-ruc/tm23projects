   No, the first <fd 13> and the <fd 106> won't count for anything as the 
comma frame delimiter will set that frames duration to 0 when it merges it 
with the next one.  Frame durations of comma delimited sets of frames must 
be in the last frame.

   There is no one tick delay between frames.

   The comma frame delimiter is exactly equivalent to <fd 0> / 
<NoErase>.  So your <fd 13> "+" , <fd 13> "O" is in actual fact <fd 13> "+" 
<fd 0> / <NoErase> <fd 13> "O" and the last switch is the one that DMDX uses.
