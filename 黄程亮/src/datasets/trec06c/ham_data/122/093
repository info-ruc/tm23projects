Grid Computing and Peer to Peer Systems 
Grid Computing and Peer to Peer Systems are two different approaches to highly similar objectives i.e. the pooling and sharing of large sets of distributed resources but differ in their requirements since they focus on two different sets of users. Also Grid computing is primarily focused on distributed computing while Peer to Peer systems currently are restricted to mostly file sharing with focus on anonymities and dealing with failures in the network. Thus a merger of these two areas could deliver better distributed applications that could expand its horizons beyond those of current grid computing resources. In the physiology of the Grid the , the authors discusses the Open Grid Service Architecture that serves as the standard for Grid computing and how Grid computing streamlines the process by using standards and extends the system beyond languages and operating systems by using a web service based architecture. On the other hand peer to peer systems do not currently have any standards developed and hence most applications have their own way of splitting and hashing files and their own network topologies. Thus any user of a peer to peer system if he wants to use two different peer to peer applications need to run both of them simultaneously and cannot share files from one system to another. This limitation in peer to peer system stems from the emerging technology scenario that exists for peer to peer systems as each new implementation of a peer to peer system hold usually little resemblance to a previous system in terms of operation and overlay connections other than supporting the basic functionalities of node join and churn. Grid Computing on the other hand is a commercial solution to enhancing resources for distributed computing. Also since Grid computing uses SOAP which is an XML based protocol over HTTP that provides a means for messaging between a service provider and a service requestor. Thus Grid computing has a more service oriented architecture implemented on a smaller scale where some indexing of ser
 have a centralized system of indexing service providers whereas peer to peer systems are a totally decentralized system which are scalable across millions of nodes but suffer more from churn related issues.
