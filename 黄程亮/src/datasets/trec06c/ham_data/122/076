Grid is a different response to issues similar to some that P2P
applications have been developed to deal with: sharing and allocating
resources over widely distributed networks. The main point of the OGSA
paper is an outline of the distributed services architecture. Hosts
implement service factories that create transient service instances upon
request. To tolerate failures that could potentially cause orphaning of
service requests, OGSA uses a soft-state approach where every instance has
a pre-negotiated lifetime, and extending the lifetime requires explicit
requests from clients. To advertise and discover services, OGSA requires a
centralized registry service.

Grid and P2P both seek to optimize the same general idea: the distribution
of resources. The only difference is the perceived usage of the two
systems. While Grid tends to be used in more scientific settings where
such things as incentives are not a concern and the number of distinct
independent entities in the network is small, P2P is often associated with
file-sharing services where leechers who do not share their bandwidth are
common and the network has completely different characteristics. However,
that is just a difference in assumptions. One could easily take, for
instance, the file storage distribution system of Samsara and apply it
over a network that Grid is running on. Or one could apply a resource
exchange application such as SHARP.
