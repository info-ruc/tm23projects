Grades for Mid-term#2, homework6 and homework7 is available online via
eGradebook. Also, make a note of the number of late days you have used. If
you have already used 3, you do not have any for the project deadline.

Project
~~~~~~~

The sample trace files for the project is available via the following link:

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~skeckler/cs352/project/

The simple and experiment trace files will be available soon.

We strongly encourage the students to use the trace files from this path
so that we do not have multiple copies of the huge trace files in
every student's space.

Problem5 in homework#7 is a good start for the project. The code in the solution set  was just a pseudo
code to give you an idea of about the implementation. Go through the
specification document and list the functionalities of the cache
simulator. As Prof.Keckler suggested, spend quality time with the design
so that coding becomes obvious.

Ping Prof.Keckler/me if you have any questions about the project.

Cheers,

Madhavi
