The Open Grid Services Architecture (OGSA) if presented in what seems less 
like a technical paper and more like a call to arms.  There are resources 
being wasted and interoperability between platforms is practically 
non-existant.  Grid responds by setting up a protocol that will allow 
Virtual Organizations (VO) to share resources with each other (these 
resources could be memory, processor, whatever).  The authors assure quality 
of service and robustness while trying to build upon currently accepted 
standards.  By allowing all resources to be seen as services, the authors 
set up Grid to allow for the management of distinct global resources.

Death and taxes draw a parallel between grids and p2p.  They claim that 
grids have been focused mainly on infrastructure.  Grids, in general, are 
used on networks where the structure of the network is known or can be 
administered.  Furthermore, the systems are generally up for long periods 
and do not go down unannounced (unless an error occurs).  P2P systems, on 
the other hand, have been focused on failure.  With a high churn rate, P2P 
systems focus mainly on making sure the system does not go haywire when a 
quarter of the population randomly disappears.  The authors claim that these 
two systems should and will eventually converge.  Grid computing will gain 
something by churn resistance and P2P system will gain by having a solid 
infrastructure.
