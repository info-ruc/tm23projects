Forum: The Successful Repository, Brisbane, June 29, 2006.

APSR, in collaboration with the Queensland University Libraries Office of 
Cooperation (QULOC) and the RUBRIC Project, is pleased to announce "The 
Successful Repository", a forum on issues of repository management to be 
held in Brisbane on 29 June.

Many Australian universities have now recognised the need for a repository 
and have taken steps to put one into place.  "The Successful Repository" is 
designed for repository managers, administrators and funders who are 
seeking to ensure that they get the best value from their repository.  The 
topics to be covered will include costing the repository, measuring 
repository value and adapting the repository to serve the institutional 
mission.

Speakers will include Susan Gibbons, Assistant Dean, Public Services & 
Collection Development, University of Rochester, and John Houghton, 
Professorial Fellow in Strategic Economic Studies at Victoria University of 
Technology.

The Successful Repository will be held at Customs House, 399 Queen Street, 
Brisbane on 29 June.  The cost of attendance is $75.  Further details, and 
a registration form, can be found at 
<http://www.apsr.edu.au/successful/successful.htm>http://www.apsr.edu.au/successful/successful.htm 
.

Susan Gibbons will also be presenting a public lecture on the morning of 
Friday, June 30, to be entitled "Redefining Academic Librarianship for the 
Net Generation".  This will be held at the University of Queensland and 
further details will be made available as they come to hand.
