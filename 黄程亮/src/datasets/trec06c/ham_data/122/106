Overview

   Oracle products and components are affected by multiple
   vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote
   execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of
   service.


I. Description

   Oracle has released Critical Patch Update - April 2006. This update
   addresses more than thirty vulnerabilities in different Oracle
   products and components.

   The Critical Patch Update provides information about affected
   components, access and authorization required, and the impact of the
   vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   MetaLink customers should refer to MetaLink Note 293956.1 (login
   required) for more information on terms used in the Critical Patch
   Update.

   According to Oracle, none of the vulnerabilities corrected in the
   Oracle Critical Patch Update affect Oracle Database Client-only
   installations.

   The PL/SQL Gateway vulnerability identified as PLSQL01 in the Oracle
   Critical Patch Update corresponds to US-CERT Vulnerability Note
   VU#169164, which includes further details including workarounds.

   In most cases, Oracle does not associate Vuln# identifiers (e.g.,
   DB01) with other available information. As more details about
   vulnerabilities and remediation strategies becomes available, we will
   update the individual vulnerability notes.


II. Impact

   The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product,
   component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences
   include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information
   disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components may be
   available to unauthenticated, remote attackers. An attacker who
   compromises an Oracle database may be able to gain access to sensitive
   information.


III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle
   Critical Patch Update - April 2006. Note that this Critical Patch
   Update only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for
   previously known issues are not listed.

   As noted in the update, some patches are cumulative, others are not:

     The Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise
     Manager Grid Control, Oracle Collaboration Suite, JD Edwards
     EnterpriseOne and OneWorld Tools, and PeopleSoft Enterprise Portal
     Applications patches in the Updates are cumulative; each successive
     Critical Patch Update contains the fixes from the previous Critical
     Patch Updates.
     Oracle E-Business Suite and Applications patches are not
     cumulative, so E-Business Suite and Applications customers should
     refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to identify previous fixes
     they wish to apply. 

   Patches for some platforms and components were not available when the
   Critical Patch Update was published on April 18, 2006. Please see
   MetaLink Note 360465.1 (login required) for more information.

   Known issues with Oracle patches are documented in the
   pre-installation notes and patch readme files. Please consult these
   documents specific to your system before applying patches.
