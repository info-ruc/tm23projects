Implementing Declarative Overlays
Macedon:  Methodology for Automatically Creating, Evaluating, and Designing
Overlay Networks

P2 is a system that is designed to simplify the process of writing overlay
networks using a logic language and dataflow framework.  Coding for P2 is
done with Overlog, a Prolog-like language that is suited for specifying and
implementing rules associated with overlay network behavior.  Two examples
of real world overlay networks, Narada and Chord, are illustrated using the
P2 framework.  Both systems were shown to be written using significantly
less code than a direct implementation, or in some cases, even other
declarative overlay systems.  There a number of similarities between the P2
approach and the evolution of database systems and querying languages.
Analysis of performance is provided, and shown to be "acceptible", but it i=
s
clearly stated that performance is not one of the goals of P2 at this
stage.  It is also noted that although Overlog facilitates writing overlay
rules, it has many drawbacks as a language, particularly when compared to
popular, familiar, object oriented languages.

MACEDON is an earlier, but in many ways similar system, to P2.  MACEDON als=
o
seeks to provide a framework to reduce the amount of code that must be
written to create an overlay network.  MACEDON is shown to be particularly
geared to distributed hash tables and certain kinds of high-level multicast
networks.  MACEDON models overlay networks based on a finite state machine.
A implementation of Overcast is used throughout the paper to describe a
variety of MACEDON's features, but the evaluation compares a number of
different systems that were implemented with MACEDON, including NICE, Chord=
,
and Pastry.  MACEDON's programming syntax appears to be similar to that of
languages like C++ and Java.  As with P2, the focus of evaluation appears t=
o
be the number of lines of code required to implement a given overlay, with
less of a focus on actual performance.

Many of the notable drawbacks of P2 and Overlog are recognized in the paper
itself.  It is difficult to evaluate the ongoing work on P2, such as making
the language more readable, from the information provided in the paper.
However, given their reasons for using a Prolog-style language, and
comparisons made between Datalog and SQL in the paper, it seems unlikely
that Overlog will be changed in a drastic way.  MACEDON appears to currentl=
y
be tailored around existing overlay models, and this may provide some
problems when trying to implement something novel using MACEDON.  One
interesting point in the paper was that the authors noticed that there was
an issue with their implementation of NICE, and stated a proposed solution
that is said to be "straightforward" but did not implement it and attempt t=
o
get more accurate data.  This seems to raise some questions about how
"straightforward" or easy it is to make the change that was proposed.
