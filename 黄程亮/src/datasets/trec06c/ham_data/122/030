STOPPING THE WAR BEFORE IT STARTS:
WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW TO RESIST 

A WAR AGAINST IRAN
  A community teach-in 
with Ervand Abrahamian, Kaveh Ehsani, and Timothy Mitchell

moderated by Leili Kashani
presented by Action Wednesdays Against War **
  Wednesday, April 26 at 7:30pm (doors open early)
Judson Memorial Church (directions below)*
  
"We may face no greater challenge from a single country than from Iran. ... If necessary, under long-standing principles of self defense, we do not rule out the use of force before attacks occur." 
United States National Security Strategy 2006. http://www.whitehouse.gov/nsc/nss/2006/nss2006.pdf
  
 
  "Weapons of mass destruction"
"Islamic terrorists"
People in need of "liberation" and "democracy"
Open calls for "regime change"

DEJA VU?
   
  Three years into the war on Iraq the same rumors and stereotypes are being deployed, only this time, with multilateral support – and against Iranians. 

The United States of America, which remains the only country to have ever used an atomic weapon against a civilian population and today has 890 permanent military bases in 130 countries, continues to talk about imminent threats to its security. 
   
  How is this like and unlike the lead-up to attacking Iraq?
Is this about Iran's alleged pursuit of nuclear weapons? 
Or regime change? Is this about oil? 
Does international law have a role to play?
Why aren't we mobilizing against deeper sanctions and a war on Iran?
How can we do things differently this time?

Join Action Wednesdays Against War for this important conversation, designed to provide critical information about the crisis and opportunities for solidarity with progressive political movements in Iran and with anti-war forces throughout the world.
