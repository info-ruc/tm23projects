Wheaton's Laplante Earns National Co-Hitter-of-the-Week Honors


NORTON, MA- Wheaton College baseball standout Adam Laplante (Harwich, 
MA/Harwich) has been named co-hitter of the week by the National Collegiate 
Baseball Writers Association (NCBWA) for the week ending on Sunday, April 
16. Laplante, who is the first Lyon to ever draw the national honor, shares 
the award with Guilford College (N.C.) senior Rob Bittner.

This was Laplante's third individual honor of the week, as the junior 
catcher also earned Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) and New 
England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Player-of-the-Week 
accolades.

Laplante entered last week batting .288 with one home run and six RBI on 
the season before catching fire and leading the Lyons to a 5-0 showing. The 
right-handed batter hit .600 (12-for-20) with a 1.500 slugging percentage 
and .609 on-base percentage while driving in 14 runs and scoring nine more. 
Laplante also slugged four home runs, two triples and a pair of doubles, as 
he belted his four long balls over the course of five days after homering 
twice in his first 56 collegiate games.

During a 5-0 win at the United States Coast Guard Academy on April 11, 
Laplante was 3-for-4 with three runs before going 4-for-5 with five RBI and 
three runs in a 13-7 win the next day against visiting Bridgewater State 
College. Laplante fell a double shy of the cycle while slugging his first 
career grand slam to key a seven-run fourth inning during a comeback victory.

After driving in a run and scoring once during an 8-7 win versus Worcester 
State College on April 13, Laplante continued his hot hitting in a 
doubleheader sweep at Clark University on Saturday. He drove in three runs 
during an 8-5 victory in game one, smacking a two-out, two-run triple in 
the fifth before hitting a sacrifice fly in the seventh. During the second 
contest, Laplante went 3-for-5 with four RBI and two runs while smacking 
two doubles and a home run.

Thanks in part to Laplante, the Lyons are ranked first in New England and 
seventh nationally in this week's American Baseball Coaches Association 
(ABCA) polls and, following a 6-3 win against Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology (MIT) on Tuesday, have won a program-record 15 consecutive 
games. Wheaton, which clinched its eighth NEWMAC regular season title in 
the conference's eight-year history, completes its league slate by hosting 
the United States Coast Guard Academy on Thursday at 3:30 p.m.
