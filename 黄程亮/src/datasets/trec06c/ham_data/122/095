   Not that I've heard about.  The times I've run into this it's either 
been the hardware acceleration slider or the video card wasn't actually 
capable of page flipping -- your card is certainly supposed to be capable 
of page flipping as are all cards made in the last decade.  It's possible 
your card is damaged however it's more likely that the drivers are borked 
and removing the card in the device manager and letting XP detect it again 
on reboot will fix things.
