    Great question, Jamie.  And the answer, if translated properly,
says the NKS has little to do with *reality*.
    However, thinking and rethinking the S. Wolfram' findings
(and asking him  at other Complexity Conference *my* question),
i came to the conclusion that still there is smth exciting in his
findings. And this is *not* about "similarities" (of his CA models)
with reality.  This is what looks to me as the very first step to the 
coming  "new kind of computing" (NKC) or better the "new kind of problem 
solving".
   That is, the "new kind of non-computational, organic problem solving".
What i mean is the switching from traditional slow, offline 
"wet-neural-tissue-and-paper" modeling substrate to the new, online 
high-performance "electrons-in-silicon" modeling substrate.  Now the 
model becomes an easy-to-test-and-update model vs. old, 
symbols-on-papers, impossible-to-test-and-update model.  Of course, with 
computers available, the old symbolic models can be converted - via 
algorithm and program design-development-testing cycle - into a "shadow" 
of direct in-silico model.  However, this indirect fixing is a 
*temporal* measure, with direct data-driven on-the-fly in-silico 
model-building and problerm solving already making its first steps. 

    Such an *organic* problem-solving does not require complicated (and 
not really available) equations for real-world applications, and is 
actually a problem-solving technique utilized in nature, in the living 
dynamic world.  [i learned all that first from my dog and then from my 
grandson].  Data/inputs, online model-building and "automagic" 
decision-making - no equations, no algorithms, no programs - but lots of 
online testing and updating by the great in-live trial-and-errors.

i agree if you mean here that S.Wolfram' algorithms mimic somehow the
physical reality.  Yes, the NKS seems to me makes implicitly a point 
that the computer dynamics (expressed, say, in the CA language) may be a 
*primary* modeling resource;  however, it is not yet a problem-solving
mechanism

    Does all that make any sense?
Optimistical-ly y'rs,
val

PS:
Of course, silicon chip (as we know it) is far away from the
organically-designed silicon (handling the context and associations
within a persistent framework).  That's where/how your "maps and 
territories are recombined"
    So, to me, the point is bridging a gap between dynamic/animated 
reality and  passive, dead, symbolic, highly abstract  format of 
traditional (analytical) models.  I see computer (animated) models as 
*primary* way of *undestanding via modeling*.  Live models vs. 
symbol-based, need-to-be-made-live models.  Live, online integrated with 
data models vs. dead, offline, detached from data models.  Live and 
ready-to-be-tested models vs. symbol-based need-to-be-made-testable ones.
    The NKS (remote) similarity with crystal growth is just one of the 
many features of dynamic modeling matter.  THis is not problem-solving 
yet, but the first step in right direction - to me.  One of the critical
missing links in S. Wolfram findings is the constraints/control
from the Env; the other one is a persistent content-based storage, a 
foundation for learning and updating.
