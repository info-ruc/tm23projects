Yes.  They do resemble molecular collisions underlying actual turbulence. 
Wolfram probably constructed the rules inspired by his intimate knowledge
about the physics of molecular collions.

I am not sure.  We are still dealing with molecular collisions uderlying
turbulence.   That is, the object of observation remans the same, but it
appears to the human eye differently depending on how closesely the
observer chooses to look at it. It reminds me of the situation in
probabiulity theory where one can only predict the average values of many
trials and not individual values of specific trials. Does your scale
hierarchy includes the observer?

According to Peirce (as I understand him), the actual is Secondness and
all models belong to Thirdness.  Hence, it would be natural that models
cannot reproduce acutals in every details.

Lao-tze also said something similar:

    Doh Gah Doh
    Bih Sahng Doh.

(The Chinese characters read in Korean pronouciation.  They will sound
differently if read in Chinese or Japanese.)

Once the truth is named, it is no longer the everlasting truth.
