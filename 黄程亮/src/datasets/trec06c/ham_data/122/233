Again, it is beyond discussion that TV4 had regularly from its very =

that the directors in this case were of course aware of this when they =

To focus on what should have been the core issue in this case, how and =
under what circumstances moral rights might be waived, a vital issue in =

particularly not the Appeal Court. The outcome of the judgements so far =
just leaves us with a blurred picture. Authors, filmproducers and TV =
channels deserve more.

I don't think this is correct. Channel 4 started broadcasting in 1990 =
but it was not until 1999 they began interrupting films and serials with =
what was to be coined "fake programs", short hints on books worth =
reading, info about coming programs, news items etc - all of that with =
ads attached. And this stirred up rather massive protests among viewers.

At first this strategy was considered a violation of the agreement with =
the Government, and Channel 4 had to pay around 6 million SEK in fines =
for this offence. However, the Government proposed a change in the =
legislation in 2001 so this method to insert commercials in the middle =
of programs was to become legal. Critics say that the Government yielded =
to Channel 4's threat to move abroad with their broadcasting (that is =
outside of Swedish jurisdiction) and thus they could continue cashing in =
several hundred million SEK each year for the broadcasting license from =
Channel 4.

Jan, weren't you, BTW, advisor to Channel 4 during this process?
