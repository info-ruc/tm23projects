	-----Original Message-----
	From:  Robert Larsen
	
	
	I visited both oxbows along the Pecos River just south
	of Highway 380, the large oxbow west of the Pecos on
	the refuge farm, and the one east of the river off the
	Bitter Lake refuge, Chaves County, New Mexico,

Howdy folks,
 
Robert's mention of Bitter Lakes reminds me. A couple of weeks ago, I
met two Mexican naturalists from Nuevo Leon (Carlos Velasco and his wife
Liliana). They expressed some interest in getting into odonate study,
and mentioned a large wetland complex fed by a system of sulfur-rich hot
springs. If anyone is familiar with or interested in those wetlands
specifically, or odonata of sulfur-rich hot springs in general, or is
looking for a contact in Nuevo Leon (I think he said they lived near
Monterrery) who knows the local biodiversity and natural history, let me
know, I'll get you in touch. Very friendly folks; Carlos currently
specializes in cacti, Liliana in pollinating insects.
 
I've been away from the office for about two and a half weeks in
conjunction with the birth of my son. He and his mom are both doing well
and have mostly recovered, so I am back at Bentsen again. If anyone came
by for the weekly dragonfly walk while I was gone, I hope my fellow
naturalists entertained you well. Looking forward to tomorrow's walk, to
see how much the season progressed while I was otherwise occupied.
 
One tantalizing glimpse today of a perched dragon that looked like a
Gray-waisted Skimmer (Cannaphila insularis), but was leading the
butterfly walk at the time, and had no camera handy, so am not 100%
certain. Female Argia sp. are dancing all over the butterfly garden,
lots of assorted gliders and saddlebags flying over the park road, and
at least two Great Pondhawks (Erythemis vesiculosa) today, along with
several Band-winged Dragonlets (Erythrodiplax umbrata) and Roseate
Skimmers (Orthemis ferruginea), just scattered through the forest and
gardens.
 
I did return to find a message from Bob Behrstock, dated Wednesday. He
was apparently in town leading some sort of nature/birding tour. He said
they saw dozens of Striped Saddlebags (Tramea calverti) and several
Pin-tailed Pondhawks (Erythemis plebeja) at Santa Ana NWR.
 
Cheers,
 
Josh

Howdy folks,

A family health issue caused me to miss work Sunday, including the
weekly dragonfly walk. I spent a little time outdoors today and briefly
scouted around for odonates. Two FOY species for the park: Black Setwing
(Dythemis nigrescens), which I'm pretty sure someone else reported
earlier; and a female Smoky Rubyspot (Haeterina titia) on the irrigation
canal. Abundance and diversity seem to be up significantly over three
weeks ago, when I last paid close attention. I noted at least 17 species
in what had to have been less than half an hour, mostly while taking
down and re-hanging hummingbird feeders. Still have not seen any species
of Gomphid yet this year though... And have yet to see a Black
Saddlebags in 2006, though Reds are common, and apparently so are
Striped in some places.

BTW, the most recent issue of the TPWD magazine, with the hummingbird on
the cover, has a stunning photo of a Checkered Setwing (Dythemis fugax)
on the inside front cover, I think by Larry Ditto.

Smoky Rubyspot (H. titia) 1 female on irrigation canal
Blue-fronted Dancer (Argia apicalis) 1 male on canal
Blue-ringed Dancer (A. sedula) several males on canal
Dusky Dancer (A. translata) one male on canal
Powdered Dancer (A. moesta) one male on the pond in the butterfly garden
Familiar Bluet (Enallagma civile) a few males on the pond
Rambur's Forktail (Ischnura ramburii) a tandem pair on the pond
Black Setwing (D. nigrescens) a male on the pond
Eastern Pondhawk (Erythemis simplicicollis) a few males on the pond
Great Pondhawk (E. vesiculosa) a male on the pond
Band-winged Dragonlet (Erythrodiplax umbrata) a male on the pond
Spot-tailed Dasher (Micrathyria aequalis) 2 males on the pond
Roseate Skimmer (Orthemis ferruginea) 2+ males, 1-2 ovipositing females
on the pond
Blue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) 1-2 males on the pond
Wandering Glider (Pantala flavescens) a LOT; some near the pond, most
along the roadside
Spot-winged Glider (P. hymenea) one hovering low over the pond, probably
others roadside
Red Saddlebags (Tramea onusta) a couple on the pond, more roadside

Cheers,

Josh

I was pleased to see several Desert Firetails (Telebasis salva) -- mating
pairs and patrolling males-around my small backyard pond today.  These may
have just emerged from last year's breeders here.  For some of last year's
photos, see <a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.duhons.net/Telebasis_salva.htm">http://www.duhons.net/Telebasis_salva.htm</a> .

 

The only other yard ode that I saw today was a Black Saddlebags.

Howdy folks,

Two long-awaited seasonal firsts today. I know lots of other people have
been seeing clubtails for weeks, including Dave Hanson here in the LRGV,
but it took me here at Bentsen-RGV State Park until yesterday to see
one, and until today to identify one. Yesterday's looked to be some sort
of forcepstail (Aphylla sp.), but just as I spotted it, a cloud passed
over, the wind gusted much higher, and the dragon flew around the canal
a few times and away. Today, during the butterfly walk, I flushed a
clubtail up into a small tree, where it perched long enough for me to
recognize it as Russet-tipped (Stylurus plagiatus).

Also during the butterfly walk, I crossed the irrigation canal, and
checked from the bridge for Caribbean Yellowface. No luck there, but
even better: I spotted a long, thin, dark damsel with a brilliant orange
thorax. Amelia's Threadtail (Neoneura amelia)! I had seen this one once
before, at Anzalduas just after one of the Dragonfly Days festivals, but
never again until now. Funny thing was, Terry Fuller came through the
park earlier today, and asked if I'd been to Anzalduas to look for
threadtails, prophetic...

Cheers,

Josh

I was out in my yard this afternoon and saw my first bright-red male Neon
Skimmer of the year.  Later on, I discover its exuvia on a plant next to my
backyard pond.  A photo of this shell is at the bottom of this web page:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.duhons.net/Libellula_croceipennis.htm">http://www.duhons.net/Libellula_croceipennis.htm</a> .  This was my first time
to find one of these, and I thought it was interesting-especially given the
fact that I helped &quot;raise&quot; this one in my own backyard!

 

Also seen here today were mating Desert Firetails and several Black
Saddlebags.

Thanks to Dennis Paulson, I have corrected the ID on the exuvia I found in
my backyard yesterday.  It is a COMMON GREEN DARNER, not a Neon Skimmer (as
I previously thought).  The photo has been moved to the bottom of this page:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.duhons.net/Anax_junius.htm">http://www.duhons.net/Anax_junius.htm</a> .  

 

In my yard today I have seen a lovely Neon Skimmer that lingered around for
several hours, plus an early-morning Common Green Darner and several Desert
Firetails.

Sorry for the late posting, but I have just returned home to a computer. On Sunday 30 April, while playing at Lost Maples, I flushed a Banded Pennant Celithemis fasciata. When I lived in TX, I usually encountered this species in late May or June, so thought it was early. So, I went after it with my camera but came up with nothing. It appeared to be a fairly recent emergent as it flew into grass, where I lost it twice; it was not perching in the open. It last flew into some short trees where I lost it, on the north side of the pond (where they are typically found) in late spring.
On the Odonata Central site, 7 May is the earliest record. Since I had only a sighting, perhaps one of the locals can move the early date up a couple of days.
Other ode activity was decent, but nothing other than the usual suspects in modest numbers. Beautiful spot, as always and a great way to spend a day.

Howdy folks,

Bar-sided Darner (Gynacantha mexicana) is sort of the Clay-colored Robin
of the odonates: once an exclamation-point rarity, now - whether due to
our greater awareness or the species' change in distribution - a regular
LRGV occurrence. As recently as 1998, had never been recorded in the US.
First photo, 1999; first specimen, 2000. Nearly all of the records have
been from Santa Ana NWR, though I know of at least two specimens and one
photo from the Valley Nature Center, and three specimens from a hospital
in Harlingen (the same hospital where my son was just born last month,
wierdly enough). Given the small number of people looking at
dragonflies, and Gynacantha's crepuscular habits, it has been widely
speculated that the species is more common and widespread in the LRGV
than was previously thought.

With all this presumed abundance, and especially after Dennis Paulson
and John Abbott came down here last fall and found dozens of G. mexicana
emerging from wetlands at Santa Ana, I've been expecting since my
arrival to find the species here at Bentsen-RGV State Park. And... I've
been frustrated. A few brief sightings of large dragons foraging around
dusk, but I have been unable to find *any* darner species here at
Bentsen other than Anax junius, the Common Green Darner.

Until today! I was walking from my office for a totally unrelated reason
and spotted a large dragon roosting in the ample shade of the World
Birding Center's unorthodox roof. In binoculars, sure enough, Gynacantha
mexicana! Not a new county record, but a first for the park, so far as I
know. I ran back to my office for the camera and snapped a few photos
just in case.

Little else new to report here. Four-spotted Pennant (Brachymesia
furcata) first showed up last weekend and seems to be getting more
common, along with other typical LRGV pond species: Roseate Skimmer,
Red-tailed Pennant, Black Setwing, Spot-tailed Dasher, Eastern and Great
Pondhawk. I've checked several times for another Caribbean Yellowface or
Amelia's Threadtail on the canal without success (have not made it to
the Rio Grande since mid- or late March). Still have not seen my first
Black Saddlebags of the year, though I did see someone else report one
north of here, and Red Saddlebags is common, as is something that is
either Striped Saddlebags or Hyacinth Glider (or both). I'm guessing
Striped Saddlebags, as we have virtually no Water Hyacinth in or near
the park...

Cheers,

Josh

On Friday (5/5) and Saturday (5/6) I led morning butterfly/dragonfly walks
at the Lewisville Lake Environmental Learning Area [LLELA] in Lewisville.
The weather was cool and overcast the entire time after overnight heavy
rains each of the previous nights.  Despite these poor viewing conditions,
we were able to find the following 10 species on one or both days:

 

American Rubyspot

Great Spreadwing (FOS)

Southern Spreadwing

Familiar Bluet

Jade Clubtail (FOS)

Eastern Pondhawk

Band-winged Dragonlet

Neon Skimmer

Common Whitetail

Variegated Meadowhawk

 

Photos of the Southern Spreadwing, Jade Clubtail, and Band-winged Dragonlet
(female) have been added to my odonate web page:

Howdy folks,

Saturday is supposed to be the day I survey butterflies, and Sunday
dragonflies. At least until we switch to the summertime schedule, when
they'll be Monday and Friday.

Anway, I was putting out butterfly bait. It was one week ago, while
doing this, that I spotted the Amelia's Threadtail (Neoneura amelia) on
the irrigation canal. So, as I was doing the same task this week, I
scanned the canal again. Only inches from where the Amelia's was last
week, I spotted a Coral-fronted Threadtail (N. aaroni)!

This species is rare enough that it's not yet on the Hidalgo County
checklist at Odonata Central. I believe the first county record was just
under one year ago at Anzalduas County Park, photographed by Dennis
Paulson. Otherwise it's only been seen upriver at San Ygnacio (above
Falcon Dam), and in the Hill Country. So I dropped butterflies from my
brain and ran back to the office for the camera.

On my way back to the bridge, I spotted my third Caribbean Yellowface
(Neoerythromma cultellatum) of the year.

When I got back, I found... another Amelia's?! This threw me. Had I
misidentified the first damsel? I scanned the area, but the only other
damsel around was a Neotropical Bluet (Enallagma novahispaniae). I
photographed these two, a little confused.

Then it occurred to me to turn around and check upstream of the bridge.
Another Yellowface was there, and assorted bluets and dancers. And then,
another threadtail! Looked like aaroni, but the light was much worse,
and the damsel uncooperative, so I could not quite convince myself, much
less get a decent photo.

I returned to the downstream end. Wandered off the bridge to the canal
bank to get some photos of the Amelia's from more of a lateral view.
Then the Coral-fronted reappeared! I finally managed to get a few
photos, confirming that I really did have both species of Neoneura, and
did not just imagine one or both.

After that I spotted another damsel which still somewhat mystifies me.
It was perched, and stayed there for a while, allowing both Dave Hanson
(who showed up later with Mary Gustafson) and myself to get some decent
photos. It may just have been an Orange Bluet (Enallagma signatum), the
pattern matched that species. However, most of the body coloration was
distinctly yellow, not orange! The only noticeable orange on the critter
was on its face and eyes, and a bit in the terminal spot (abdominal
segment 9, I think). I tried to make it into the third threadtail, the
Orange-striped, but that's no more yellow than the Bluet and lacks the
terminal spot. I tried Vesper or Golden Bluet, but their spots should be
blue, not yellow.

Anyone have any ideas what this last critter was? Does the female E.
signatum have a male-like form that might be yellower but still have the
male's tail-spot? Or might the male be yellow rather than orange when
newly emerged? Are there any Mexican species that might resemble a
yellow E. signatum? Or is the sleep deprivation of the new father,
combined with the south Texas heat, just turning my brain into jello?

Oh, well. Dave says that Greg Lasley and John Abbott will be here
tomorrow. Hopefully this yellow damsel will be too... Photos of all of
the above will appear on BugGuide once I get the photos uploaded to the
computer, hopefully within the next week or two.

Cheers,

Josh

Howdy folks,

Did not get in until 1 PM today. Checked immediately and found both
threadtail species still present. Then spotted a funny-looking female
damsel, which before too long formed a tandem with one of the male
Amelia's Threadtails and started ovipositing! Called Dave Hanson; by the
time he arrived the Coral-fronted Threadtail (Neoneura aaroni) was gone,
much scanning and searching failed to relocate it.

My late arrival forced me to miss connecting with John Abbott and Greg
Lasley, who apparently spent the morning at NABA looking at clubtails.
Those they got in-hand turned out to be Sulphur-tipped (Gomphus
militaris). I have not seen a clubtail of any species here since my
previously reported Stylurus; for that matter, it occurs to me now, I
have not seen a darner of any species in weeks, with the exception of my
Bar-sided a few days ago. And I do not think I have seen any spreadwings
here since early January. Also have yet to see my first Thornbush Dasher
(Micrathyria hagenii) of the year. Our garden pond has been dry for
several days, possibly for cattail control, might be keeping a few
species scarce.

Dave also related sightings of Marl Pennant (Macrodiplax balteata) and
Seaside Dragonlet (Erythrodiplax berenice) from NABA.

A rundown of recent odonate sightings here:

American Rubyspot (Haeterina americana) one on the canal; I thought it
was H. titia based on its dull body 			color, but Dave
noted that the wings were those of H. americana
Amelia's Threadtail (Neoneura amelia) two males, one female on the canal
today; one male yesterday
Coral-fronted Threadtail (N. aaroni) one male on the canal yesterday and
today
Blue-fronted Dancer (Argia apicalis) fairly common
Blue-ringed Dancer (A. sedula) maybe the most abundant damsel right now
Dusky Dancer (A. translata) a couple of males on the canal
Double-striped Bluet (Enallagma basidens) a couple of males, one tandem
pair on the canal today
Familiar Bluet (E. civile) one tandem pair today, a few males yesterday,
on the canal
Neotropical Bluet (E. novahispaniae) a few males on the canal today
Orange Bluet (E. signatum) one suspiciously yellow-looking individual
yesterday, probably this species
Rambur's Forktail (Ischnura posita) one blue male on the canal today
Caribbean Yellowface (Neoerythromma cultellatum) two males on the canal
yesterday
Bar-sided Darner (Gynacantha mexicana) one roosting on the building
Friday
Prince Baskettail (Ephitheca princeps) one patrolling on the resaca
Friday
Red-tailed Pennant (Brachymesia furcata) becoming common on the resaca
and near the hawk tower
Four-spotted Pennant (B. gravida) a few on the resaca and canal Friday
and yesterday
Black Setwing (Dythemis nigrescens) might be the most common dragon now
other than gliders and saddlebags
Eastern Pondhawk (Erythemis simplicicollis) a few female/imm. types
scattered around
Great Pondhawk (E. vesiculosa) becoming easier to find along roadsides
and trails
Band-winged Dragonlet (Erythrodiplax umbrata) fairly common along
trails, roadsides, and in the garden
Spot-tailed Dasher (Micrathyria aequalis) becoming regular on the resaca
Roseate Skimmer (Orthemis ferruginea) present but less common than
expected, mostly garden and roadside
Blue Dasher (Pachydiplax balteata) one male today, others around, also
less common than expected
Wandering Glider (Pantala flavescens) probably most abundant dragon
Spot-winged Glider (P. hymenea) not common but can usually pick one out
of the many flavescens
Eastern Amberwing (Perithemis tenera) one male on the canal today, a few
on the resaca Friday
Striped Saddlebags (Tramea calverti) am seeing many of what I think is
this species near the hawk tower
Red Saddlebags (T. onusta) less common than earlier in the spring; still
have yet to see a Black!

So, getting 20-plus species on a day in the park is easy, do not think I
can crack 30 yet without disproportionate effort...

Cheers,

Josh

Howdy folks,

Spent this morning and early afternoon at the Valley Nature Center in
Weslaco, where they were having their family dragonfly day. Saw only
five odonate species, but they were good ones! In order of increasing
rarity:

Band-winged Dragonlet (Erythrodiplax umbrata) one immature in the brush
Great Pondhawk (Erythemis vesiculosa) one patrolling a sunny, open
garden patch
Desert Firetail (Telebasis salva) a LOT, several mating and ovipositing,
mostly in the 	vicinity of the seep/spring/pond thing
Slough Amberwing (Perithemis domitia) two males, one teneral, same
location as the Telebasis
	a third male in the muddy resaca near the cactus garden
Carmine Skimmer (Orthemis discolor) a lifer for me! Several males on the
concrete resaca, at 	least two males and one ovipositing female on
the muddy resaca

Cheers,

Josh

Howdy folks,

Briefly saw a Bar-sided Darner (Gynacantha mexicana) again today,
perched in a shady nook on the outside of one of the World Birding
Center buildings at Bentsen-Rio Grande Valley State Park. It disappeared
before I could return with a camera. I guess someday this will seem like
an everyday occurrence, but as for now, I think I've seen no more than
3-4 of these critters alive.

Also photographed an orange female Citrine Forktail (Ischnura hastata)
in the butterfly garden this afternoon. Believe it or not, this is the
first time I've seen the species in the park! Looooong overdue...

Photographed one other ode, a very dull little skimmer. Not yet certain
of species. Probably a female Band-winged Dragonlet, but I might e-mail
the photos to a few people to be sure, once I get them uploaded.

Cheers,

Josh

Can you help ID this dragonfly?

The Cub Scouts netted a dragonfly this morning up on the headlands about a 
half mile from
the Rio Grande.

I've scoured every image in Dunkle's book and can't identify this guy.

He is 1.8 to 1.9&quot; long and was a uniform grayish lavender between the black 
markings.

It's eyes are metalic violet as described in the Black setwing, but I don't 
find
the rest of the wings and body descrition a good match.

Hi Carol,
 
You had the right genus, wrong species. I think what you've got there is
a Checkered Setwing (Dythemis fugax). It's always been one of my
favorites:
<a  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.duke.edu/~jsr6/Dythfug.jpg">http://www.duke.edu/~jsr6/Dythfug.jpg</a>
Have seen that species only twice: the above photo from Santa Ana NWR,
and one specimen I collected from the East Lake tract of LRGV NWR (yes,
I had a permit) and sent up to John Abbott. Do not have it for my
Bentsen list yet. Much less common than the other two US setwings, at
least here in the Valley.
 
A crew of 10 middle schoolers showed up today at Bentsen-Rio Grande
Valley State Park. They camped here last night, with a teacher and two
parents. They came out for the butterfly walk, but were equally
interested in other insects, so we looked at odonates too. Actually, our
most exciting find was probably that our pond is full of what seem to be
Dytiscids, giant predaceous diving beetles, one adult and several
larvae. Did not bother to check the canal closely due to brutal sun and
stiff breeze, not really conducive to threadtails or other species
there. A tally:
 
Double-striped Bluet (Enallagma basidens) two males in the little pond
north of the gift shop, finally refilled after a long
                    dry spell
Familiar Bluet (E. civile) manymales in both ponds, a couple of tandem
pairs ovipositing
Rambur's Forktail (Ischnura ramburii) one orange female, one olive-green
female
Blue-fronted Dancer (Argia apicalis) a few males and females scattered
through the butterfly garden
Blue-ringed Dancer (A. sedula) same, including one tandem pair not
particularly close to water
Prince Baskettail (Epitheca princeps) one male? patrolling near
Kingfisher Overlook, seen during a morning walk
Red-tailed Pennant (Brachymesia furcata) also seen earlier in the day.
Four-spotted Pennant (B. gravida) one fly-by at the little pond
Black Setwing (Dythemis nigrescens) one female near but not at the
little pond
Eastern Pondhawk (Erythemis simplicicollis) several female/imm. seen in
various locations, not at water
Great Pondhawk (E. vesiculosa) one of the most common species today,
seen both at and away from water
Band-winged Dragonlet (Erythrodiplax umbrata) one male at the pond, a
few female/imm. around the garden
Spot-tailed Dasher (Micrathyria aequalis) males on both ponds
Blue Dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) many female/imm. away from water;
another species becoming more common
Roseate Skimmer (Orthemis ferruginea) males on both garden ponds, a
female mating and ovipositing on the little one
Carmine Skimmer (O. discolor) several males and one female at water
features in the park, but none in the garden
Wandering Glider (Pantala flavescens) a male on the garden pond, others
away from water
Red Saddlebags (Tramea onusta) a few away from water
 
18 species total. Still have yet to see several usually common taxa yet
this year: Black Saddlebags, Thornbush Dasher, any species of spreadwing
damselfly. Have seen the same number of species in the genus Neoneura as
I have in the family Aeshnidae (2 each)! But I still think I could top
40 species with a few hours' focused search around Hidalgo County: here,
Anzalduas, NABA, Santa Ana, VNC, maybe Estero Llano Grande and Edinburg,
perhaps Martin Reid's little discovery in McAllen; if I wanted to get
really crazy I could add La Sal del Rey. And hey, just a few more weeks
until the start of Leptobasis season down here...
 
Tom Langscheid, are you still out there? Still planning to do a
dragonfly count on or around July 4?
 
Josh
