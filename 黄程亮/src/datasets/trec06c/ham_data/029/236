Hi friends!

I need some help from you, it's being very difficult to obtain the parts to
make my Handy Board here in Brazil. I'm buying one from Hong Kong, but I'd
like to buy some extra 68hc11s and lcds, between other things.

I have relatives in the USA, but they couldn't find the part listing I sent
them, only in high quantities. I'd like to know from you some good suppliers
for 68hc11 and the other integrated circuits in general. If there is some in
Florida, that will be excellent. If someone could send me a list of
suppliers, I'd be very glad.

Another very interesting topic I've seen in this list is the rf link
modules. If someone have the rf link module schematic I offer myself to make
an interface pcb for using with the handy board.

Thank you very much!

See you,
Cesar
