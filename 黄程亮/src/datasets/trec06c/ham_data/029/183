Hi,

Now that the topic of RF commucation seems to arise again, I have a question
too. After looking at the RF modules of radiometrix and linx I concluded
that:
1. They are too expensive
2. They are probably not available here in the netherlands

Since I'm a student in electrical enginering I figured that I should be able
to build some RF module myself. But until now I did not find any hint/links
on the internet how to do something like that. Is there nobody out there who
designed a cheap working RF module for data communication up to about 10
kbps??

I just want a cheap RF link between my PC and HB.....

Hope somebody has any hints/links...

Thanx in advance,

Bastiaan Jansen
