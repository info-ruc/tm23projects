I have not been following the RF questions thread closely on the list,
so I don't know what has been mentioned.  I have had success using the
Radiometrix transceiver modules to establish two-way communication at
9600 baud between my HP 48 graphing calculator and the Handy Board.  The
HP wants an RS 232 signal and the RF modules want TTL.  So I have used
an rmax 232 to do the conversion.  Also, I have used a PIC micro
controller between the calculator and the RF module to change the modes
of the transceiver based upon control signals sent by the calculator.
The result is, I can drive my robot from my calculator (RF) and then
press a button on the calculator and return an analog value from the
Handy Board and display it on the HP calculator screen in real time. In
addition, I use the calculator to display data (distance vs. time)
collected form the Handy Board in graphical format.

Let me know if you want additional info.

Fred
