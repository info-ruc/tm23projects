Bastiaan:
     I wanted to suggest that you investigate the Ham Radio community.  Some
search words to help get you started include PACKET and ARRL.  The first is
one of the digital communications protocalls used in Ham Radio, and the second
is an organization of Radio Amateurs in the U.S. (American Radio Relay
League).  You could also visit your local library to look for a book call "The
ARRL 19xx HANDBOOK" (where xx is the year of your choice).

hope this helps,
Pherd
