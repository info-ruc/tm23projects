I haven't used the transducer multiplexor myself; I decided to just hook
up a second sonar module to the HB in the same manner as the first is
hooked up.  It looks like using the multiplexor ought to be fairly
simple, though.

First off, in the drawing you have the 9 pins on the sonar module board
backwards.  Pin 1 is at the edge of the board and pin 9 is toward the
middle of the board.

It looks like the multiplexor uses pins PD2 and PD3 of the SPI port,
each to switch on one of the tranducers (although it seems like a
circuit could be designed to use just *one* digital output to toggle
between the two!)

To enable PD2 through PD5 as digital outputs, do a bit_set( 0x1009, 0x3C
) toward the top of your program.  Note that this is a little different
from the bit_set( 0x1009, 0x30 ) that's used in the original sonar.c,
since that only required PD4 & PD5.

The PD2 through PD5 pins are mapped to the middle four bits of byte
0x1008.  Here's how to activate them:

               SONAR
SPI PIN        FUNCTION        SEND HIGH (TURN ON)
----------     -----------     -----------------------
PD2 (MISO)     transducer1     bit_set( 0x1008, 0x04 )
PD3 (MOSI)     transducer2     bit_set( 0x1008, 0x08 )
PD4 (SCK)      binh            bit_set( 0x1008, 0x10 )
PD5 (SS)       init            bit_set( 0x1008, 0x20 )

To send a pin low (turn it off) simply do a bit_clear with the
appropriate arguments in place of the bit_set.

First, switch the first transducer on by sending PD2 (MISO) high.  Then
ping the sonar by sending PD5 high and wait for the echo as usual (see
the sonar.c code on the HB web site).

To switch to the other transducer, switch the first transducer off by
sending PD2 low and then immediately switch the other transducer on by
sending PD3 high.  Ping as before.  Make sure you don't initiate the
ping without first switching one of the two transducers on!

I hope my explanation isn't too confusing and that I didn't make any
mistakes.  Good luck!

Wendy Parson,           The real problem is not whether machines think,
Will Bain,                                          but whether men do.
