I am using a rug warior pro whose brain is very similar to the Handyboard
and would like to know if these VHF radio Data Modules could be set up
between the computer serial port and the Rug Warrior brain to provide a
radio link instead of the 4 wire telephone line.
                                Thank You
                                                     John Edwards
