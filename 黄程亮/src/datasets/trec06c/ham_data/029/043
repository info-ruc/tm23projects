Hi all,

The motor(x,y) function in the lib_hb.c file works as expected (the motor
speed does vary depending on value given and the correct motor goes on),
but when I actually have a motor in the header both LEDs go on! (and I get
corresponding rotation in both directions). The activity (Led lighting and
rotation)is primarily in the direction I want, but also the other
direction. Any suggestions for a work around? Also it is evident at lower
speeds (less than 50) only.
