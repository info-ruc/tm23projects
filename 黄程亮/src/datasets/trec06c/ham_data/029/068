That will only allow one half of the conversation.  I suppose you could run
with two kits, one receive, one transmit, both tuned to different
frequencies.  

Another suggestion might be one of the cordless, battery operated intercom
system units.  Most of the units today that are wireless seem to require AC,
but I know in the past there were units that ran off a 9v battery.

>Radio Shack have a small FM Transmitter kit . I think it was about $10.
