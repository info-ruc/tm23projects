First, to enable the four SPI pins D2 through D5 as digital outputs,
make sure you do a bit_set( 0x1009, 0x3C ).  (In the sonar.c program,
for example, bit_set( 0x1009, 0x30 ) seems to only enable two of the
pins--not all four).  I think poke would work OK here, too, even though
it actually clears bits in addition to setting bits.

The middle 4 bits of byte 0x1008 map to ports D2 through D5.  To send
the pins high, do the following:
                                          Bit mask
Port           Send high                  7654 3210
---------      -----------------------    ---- ----
D2 (MISO)      bit_set( 0x1008, 0x04 )    0000 0100
D3 (MOSI)      bit_set( 0x1008, 0x08 )    0000 1000
D4 (SCK)       bit_set( 0x1008, 0x10 )    0001 0000
D5 (SS)        bit_set( 0x1008, 0x20 )    0010 0000

Of course, to send 'em low again, just do the corresponding bit_clear. 
You can set or clear multiple bits in one statement; you just need to
figure out what the bit mask equates to in hexadecimal.  You could even
set *and* clear bits simultaneously by using poke (instead of bit_set or
bit_clear) with the appropriate mask.  Good luck!
