I'd like to thank everybody who sent me all this valuable information about
suppliers and rf link. I think now I can make my handyboard with less then
US$ 60.00 without the batteries and motor drivers (I want to use it in data
acquisition). As I have to pay a lot of dutties it will get around US$
120.00.


Thank you a lot for it!

See you,
Cesar
