Shiva,

When the Windows hddl.exe complains that it cannot open the port, it 
is usually due to another Windows programming using / holding that 
serial port.

Try all the comm ports to see if hbdl.exe allows it to open one of 
them, then attach the handyboard to that comm port.

If none of the comm ports are available to open, then check all the 
windows programs that load, and deactivate (or not load) those that 
us the comm port.
For example; Internet dialers, Fax software, etc.
