	That's a funny question.  I just finished a class on this exact topic.  =
The
basic determining factors when deciding whether to use a stepper motor or=
 a
DC brush/less servo motor is speed and open/closed loop control.  Stepper
motors are limited to about 3000 RPM.  You should also determine whether =
to
use open or closed-loop control.  Closed loop control should be used when
the accuracy required is submicron (or ~0.00004 in), or when the cost of
position loss is higher than the cost of implementing a closed loop syste=
m.
DC servo motors should be used when there is a need for closed-loop contr=
ol.
If you decide to use a  closed-loop DC servo system, there are many
vendor-supplied cards that are a much preferred route rather that trying =
to
design a closed loop system.  Hope this helps!
