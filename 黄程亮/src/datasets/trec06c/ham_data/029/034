Hi to all, I would like to know what difference there are if I connect the
6 diodes between the Handy Board & the Polaroid Sonar Card. Can I connect
the cards without diodes?
I tested the voltage at the Catode at the end of the 6th diode and my
Voltmeter showed 4.5 volts.

Should we use the 3 amp diodes?
Could somebody advise?...

Thanks in advance for your information. :-)
