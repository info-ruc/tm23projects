Hi everybody
I seek someone who can help me.
I use handy board and xc40 board(it mounts xc4010 FPGA chip).
And I have to make two board communicate each other.
But there is  a problem that I don't know the method.
In handy board's F&Q page, It says that SPI ports can be used as
digital outputs.
Does it mean that just put a wire into SPI port?           
To use SPi as digital outputs which method must I use?
If there is someone who experienced similar case,pleas help me!
Let me kmow the method.
