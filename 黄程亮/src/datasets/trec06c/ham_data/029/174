Last night we discovered that we had left our Handyboard on ZAP when we thought 
we had left it to trickle.  It was left at this condition for about 6 hours.  
This morning the motors are running very sluggish.  Are our Handyboard or its 
batteries salvagable?
Any comment on how we should proceed will help.

Also the Handyboard was not fully discharged when we left it.

Thank you
Chris Lott and Jason Moore
