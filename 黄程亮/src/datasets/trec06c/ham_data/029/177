To properly comunicate with any PC you need to convert your TTL TX and TTL
RX signals coming from the Handy Board to RS232 voltage levels. The charging
board contains this interface IC called the "MAX232"

The power wire is required unless you are willing to power the Serial
interface board from a separate wall adapter and you definetly require the
ground wire because this is the common ground return for both the TX and RX
lines.

You need power to supply the MAX232 IC!

As for your second question I assume that most of these RF links require
only TTL level TX and RX signal and a common ground to work so there is no
need to use the charging board at all.

I hope this helps.
