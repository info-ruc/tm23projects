That's a hard one because you have to have sufficient gain from the
robot microphone to hear someone 2 to 8 foot from the microphone. 

Usually communication equipment limits their microphone gain on purpose
to exclude background noise.  You have to talk directly into the
microphone in most cases.  

When you find a solution, please post it on the handy board mail list
will you?
