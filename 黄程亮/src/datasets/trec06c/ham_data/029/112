Another possible neat solution would be to use a pair of VHF radio Data
modules at each end. These normally send digital data, but if you pulse width
modulate / demodulate at each end then audio could be sent.
 There is a company that advertises in Circuit Cellar Ink magazine , ABACOM
Technologies, Fax (416) 242 2697 - Voice # (416) 242 3120, No web site listed.
   In the latest Circuit Cellar Ink, they have TX & RX data modules for about
$25.
