The wireless data link from Linx Technologies has a built- in RS232 interface,
and a prototyping area to add your application. The board gives you the option
to route the tx and rx signals from this prototyping area or the RS232
interface by setting a few jumpers.
Since I kept getting "Board sync error" messages using the built- in RS232, I
decided to try to use the handyboard's interface, and route the tx and rx via
the prototyping area.
I'm still trying to get the thing to work.
The only problem I can see is that the transmitter and receiver on the board
uses 0 to 3V logic levels. I am using a 2N4401 transistor on the receiver's
output ( Base= 0 to 3V Data in, Emitter = Gnd, Collector = 5V to 4.7K Resistor
to 0- 5V Data out). Additionally, I have the data output of the transistor
going through an inverter, since the transistor reverses the logic. For the
transmitter, I have a 13K resistor in series with the tx line. ( This was
suggested for data rates below 9600 baud).
I am open to any suggestions.
Dave
