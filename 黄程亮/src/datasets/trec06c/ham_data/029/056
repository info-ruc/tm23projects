Hi,

We are trying to transmit our voices to our remote robot to create the
impression that the robot is talking=2E
In addition, we want to be able to hear what the robot hears=2E

Does anyone know any products that we can attach to our robot that will
enable something like this?

Thanks for any input=2E  :)
