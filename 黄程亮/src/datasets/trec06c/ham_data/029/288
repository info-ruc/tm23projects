I just wanted to voice a warning of sorts.  I ordered the 2 X 16 LCD from 
them and the pinout is slightly different.  Instead of a single line of 
14 pins:

  x x x x x x x x x x x x x x

They come with a dual inline 2x7 pin configuration:

  x x x x x x x 
  x x x x x x x 

I believe they're compatible otherwise.  But you will have to make a 
rather nasty cable to connect the LCD to the Handyboard.

Perhaps someone could make a board with tracings and pin headers (male) 
that would connect the two - a sort of sandwich of sorts.  The 2x7 pin 
out seems to be fairly common these days.  Perhaps even the new 
"expansion board" that Fred and company are working on could contain an 
alternate pinout for 2x7 LCDs.
