Unfortunately, I have not had any luck. This brings me back to the first
point- is it possible to use the serial interface board by just providing
the
tx and rx lines?

<<snip>>

In short, no.  The serial interface board takes power from the HB to drive
it's end of the serial link to the computer.  If you want to convert the
link between the interface board and the HB to wireless, you should be able
to power the interface board with a 9V battery which you could stuff into
the (conveniently large) plastic base.  However you do it, the serial board
needs power, and if the Tx/Rx connection to the HB is wired, you need a
ground (common) wire too, even if the serial board is independently powered.
