I have a handboard for sale, with display, only one L293D chip installed.
Has passed all the checks in the assembly manual, as I understand them.
$175.00

Also have a rug warrior board for sale, it is missing the L293D chip (it got
put in the handy board) and the sensors that attach to the board.  This
project is about 3 or 4 years old and I don't remmber the status of the
board,  I don't think I ever got around to downloading to the board.  $50.00
