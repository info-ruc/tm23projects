Nice people, good service (they sent me spec sheets once without me
ordering!)

HC11's for about $6.95 or so, and they have almost every part you'll need
for a HB, miniboard or Rug Warrior board. (MAX233 chips, 32k RAM,
crystals, latches, etc.) Several monts ago, I prices out
a basic Rug Warrior 'brain' there for about $35 (not including motor
drivers, PCB etc.)
