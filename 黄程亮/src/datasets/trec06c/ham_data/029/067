I would only caution you that there are two types of microphones for the 
Mac -- regular mics and "PlainTalk" microphones.  I suspect you are 
talking about a PlainTalk mic.  The obvious distinguishing difference is 
the "longer than normal" male plug connector on the PlainTalk mic.  It's 
not left/right stereo but rather the long connector is for supplying 
power to the mic.  I can never remember all the various types of mics -- 
some are passive, some active -- electret, condenser, etc.  In any event, 
I believe the mic requires power and so is probably "active" and if 
memory serves me a condenser mic.  But someone else can clarify that.  I 
don't know the technical specs.
