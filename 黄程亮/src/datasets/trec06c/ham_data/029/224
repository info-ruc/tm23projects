Each motor may have slightly different characteristics even though they may
be the same brand and model. This is what you are probably seeing. The ultimate
solution is to use a feedback mechanism, like a shaft encoder, on the motors
and use software and/or hardware to maintain the correct speed. A cheaper alternative
is to experiment with different value pairs for the speed setting and manually
adjust them to make the robot track straight, then use the information to create
a change to your motor driver routines to compensate for the differences. This
complicates your software but is the esiest way to fix the problem. A pure software
fix will not be able to completely compensate for the differences in the motors,
too many variables to deal with, but is may be enough for your needs.
