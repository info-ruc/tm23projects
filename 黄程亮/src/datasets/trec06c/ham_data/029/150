Hi,

I'm using start_process() to run a set of processes. My questions() are:

1. does start_process() re-initailize all the called process's (local)
variables every time it calls the process?

2. If the process does not complete before its alloted time, does it
continue from where it ended (from the previous call), or start at the
beginning again?

I ask these questions because I have code that runs normally for the first
few seconds, then suddenly goes through the processes much faster.

Thanks,
Shiva Sinha
