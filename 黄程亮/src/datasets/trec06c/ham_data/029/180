<<we had left it to trickle.  It was left at this condition for about 6
hours.

You probably should remove the battery pack, put it in a baggie, and take it
to Radio Shack. Buy a replacement from their selection of packs for toy R/C
vehicles.  Insist that they keep your old pack.  They won't give you
anything for it, but they are supposed to provide free proper disposal of
toasted NiCads.  If there is any gunk on the bottom of the HB or inside the
case, wipe it off with a disposable rag and finish the cleanup with another
rag dampened with baking soda and water.  Wash your hands.
