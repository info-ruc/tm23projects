Hello this is mike, I am writing regarding the handy board.  What happened
was while working on the handy board, our motor control (the H-bridge)
heat
sink touch the metal chassis of our robot.  This lead to one of the
components on our H-bridge to start smoking, my lab partner disconnect all
external power to the handy board, and the H-bridge.  The communication
cable from the computer to the handy board was also disconnected.  The
handy board was then turned off, and later it was turned on.  When the
handy board is turned on the LCD display will not turn on.  The green and
red LED stay on.  We checked the batteries of the handy board and it was
at 10 Volts.  We started to trouble shoot the handy board last night and
we are not the best electronic technicians.  If any one has ever had this
problem please email me back, thank you.
