Hi, 

My Hb displays MEMMORY FAULT whenever I turn it on. SO I figured runneing
the hbdl.exe would help aleviate this situation. When I run it however, it
says it cannot open the port! Anyone know why? I have made certain that
the serail port is running as slow as possible.

Thanks for any help,
Shiva
