Jonathan,
	I would probably go with a futaba servo.  I dunno how much torque 
you need, but for a small(up to .30 cubic inch displacement, maybe even 
.60) engine, the s148 does the job quite nicely.  Tower hobbies sells 
them for $14, and they can be controlled by the standard servo routines 
that come in the miniboard library...
