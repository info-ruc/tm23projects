Justin,
            Thanks for your reply.  I assume you had one process doing the
PID in a tight loop, and then had other concurrent processes doing other
tasks.  Was there ever a problem with the PID process not getting scheduled
within the 1Khz system interrupt timeframe?

I was thinking of setting up an external interrupt faster than 1Khz, and was
concerned that depeding on the IC process scheduler may limit any gains of a
faster interrupt.

Aaron
