F.Y.I.

B.G. Micro no longer is selling the Text to speech IC "CTS256A-AL2"
they only have the SPO256 IC in stock.

This was confirmed by B.G. Micro on 12/07/98.

According to a few people they still sold them as pairs as of 08/98

If anybody else is looking to get the SPO256 spech IC I suggest to get them
while you can!

P.S. If anybody has any extra CTS256A-AL2 text to speech IC's I'm
interested!

Thanks
