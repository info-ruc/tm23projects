hi,
The following command will cause the DC motor to rotote one after other
according to the std lib and the command. hence, the robot will gradually
slanted. It cannot travelled in a straight. 

motor (2, 100);
motor (3,100);

My question : how to  write in such a way to modify the library files so as
to cause both wheels of the motor to rotate simultaneously so that the
robot can travel in a straight line.

rgds,
phillip
