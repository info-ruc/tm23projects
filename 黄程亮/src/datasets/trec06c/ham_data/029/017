Hi,

I got my Handyboard up and going and was trying the following code for
driving my motors. (Figure I would try known code before forking out on my
own). The code I got from the 'Inspiration to implemntation' book. Anyways
it does not seem to drive the motors (no LEDs lighting), and I was
wondering if any one knows of any problems with the code. I've looked it
over and it seems pretty reasonable.

Thanks in advance,
Shiva Sinha

int write_port (int port, int value, int mask)
{ poke(port,(value & mask) | (peek(port) & ~mask)); }

void motor_cmd(int l_ena, int l_dir, int r_ena, int r_dir)  {
write_port(port_a, (l_ena & m_mask_l) | (r_ena & m_mask_r), m_mask); 
   write_port(port_d, (l_dir & m_mask_l) | (r_dir & m_mask_r), m_mask);  }

void move(int operation)  { 
      if (operation == STOP)
	 motor_cmd(off_,0,off_,0); 
      else if (operation == FORWARD)
         motor_cmd(on,fwd,on,fwd); 
      else if (operation == BACKWARD)
	 motor_cmd(on,bkw,on,bkw); 
      else if (operation == LEFT_TURN)
	 motor_cmd(on,bkw,on,fwd); 
      else if (operation == RIGHT_TURN)
	 motor_cmd(on,fwd,on,bkw); 
}
