I've heard the difference is that the buttons, the knob and the sensor
ports won't work as expected.  Try moving pcode_hb.s19 to the directory
that contains the dl executable, or to the present working directory, or
to the directory specified in the error message.  Dl will probably find
it in one of those three locations.  I imagine that will probably fix
most all of your problems.

There are some archives available through the HB web site.  I don't know
whether they're current.

I haven't heard of such things yet.  By all means, create a web
interface for the HB!  I'll then hook up a web cam and let others
manipulate my robot online.  Thanks and good luck!
