The Polaroid Sonar board requires a supply voltage less than 7 volts. 
The battery of the handy board is around 12, so you'll probably shorten
the life of your sonar board considerably if you connect it straight in
(i.e. burn it up :.)).  The diodes are just a cheap way to reduce the
supply voltage to a safe voltage.  Any 6 volt source will due so long as
you maintain a common ground with the handyboard battery supply.  The
4.5 volts you measured is a little strange though, with the 6 diodes
specified you should be reading about 6 volts.
