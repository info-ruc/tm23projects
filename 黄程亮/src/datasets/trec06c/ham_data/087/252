Attention: 

BUSINESS PROPOSAL: STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr.Alebiri Ebimobo, Chief Accountant to the Contract Award and
Monitoring Committee (C.A.M.C) in the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporat=
ion(NNPC).
Sometimes in 1990, my committee awarded a contract to a Conglomerate ofFo=
reign
companies attached to NNPC. The contract was over-invoiced to thetune of
US$25.5 million (Twenty-five million, five Hundred Thousand United States=

Dollars only).

This was done deliberately; the over-invoicing was a deal by members of
my committee to benefit from the project. We now desire to transfer this
money, which is presently in a suspense account
of NNPC with the Central Bank of Nigeria into an overseas account, which
we expected you to provide.

BENEFIT: For providing the account where we shall remit the money, you wi=
ll
be entitled to 30% of the money. 60% will be for my partners, and me whil=
e
10% has been mapped out from the total sum to
cover any expenses that might be incurred by us during the course of this=

transaction, both local and international expenses. I would require the
following information from you:

(1) Your private Tel/Fax numbers.
It does not matter whether or not your company does project of this natur=
e
described here, the assumption is that you WON a MAJOR CONTRACT and subco=
ntracted
it out to other companies more often than
not, big trading companies or firms of related fields win major contracts=

and subcontracts to more specialized firms for execution of such contract=
s.
We have strong connections at the Central Bank of
Nigeria and the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no doubt that all=

this money will be released and transferred if we get the necessary forei=
gn
Partner (s) to assist us in the deal. Therefore,
when the business is successfully concluded, we shall through our same co=
nnections
withdraw all documents used from all the concerned government ministries
for 100% security.
If this proposal is of interest to you, then contact me on the above numb=
ers.

I wait in anticipation of your cooperation. Please all future response to=

ebimobo10@katamail.com

Yours faithfully,

Dr. Alebiri Ebimobo
