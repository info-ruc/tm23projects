Thanks for that info Jonathan

As it looks like the 64Mb fireGL video card is going to be a problem can 
you let me know which of the following video cards, if any, would be 
suitable for running DMDX?

32MB ATI Radeon (TM) VE VGA (single monitor capable)
32MB ATI Radeon (TM) VE VGA (dual monitor capable)
32MB ATI Radeon VE VGA/DVI (dual monitor capable)

Also if you know of a 64MB video card that will work with DMDX the name of 
that card etc would also be useful.
Many Thanks
Karen

   16 bit SoundBlaster should be fine, never tried a FireGL video card but 

given that someone else recently had trouble with a 3D Labs card I'm not 
too optimistic.
