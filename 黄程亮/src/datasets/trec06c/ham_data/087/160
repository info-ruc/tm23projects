   Likely just the video card.

   Yup.  3D Labs is not exactly the largest company in the world.

   I've used them before and while not perfect they were certainly 
usable.  The dual output NVIDIA cards work well.  Had less than spectacular 
results with ATI's stuff but that may have been the older ATI card I had 
and poor XP drivers (ATI don't appear to care about stuff that's already sold).
