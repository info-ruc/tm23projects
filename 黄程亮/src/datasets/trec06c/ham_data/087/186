Hi dear DMDXers,

I've tried this problem for a while but still couldn't figure it out.
Can anybody give me some advices? Thank you very much.

What I want is whenever the subject makes a response after the 
word is presneted, it goes to the next frame ("#####" for a 
constant duratoin)  immediately. Like this:

f60 <cr> <clfb>...
+1 * "response" / "#####"/;
+2 * "response" / "#####"/;
...

But I couldn't find a way to let the word disappear and go to the next frame
when subjects make a response. (I know if the word is at the last frame, I could
just take out the frame delimiter. however, here i just want the word goes 
out but the mask remain the same duration.)

Any suggestion would be very appreciated. 

Thank you,
