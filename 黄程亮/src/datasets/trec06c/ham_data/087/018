<html><div style='background-color:'><DIV>First, a quick thanks to Anna Woollams, Jonathan Forster and Wang GM for their advice on using a shortcut for DMDX when using NVIDIA GeForce cards.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I now have a naming experiment running (using a NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti&nbsp;4200 card with AGP8X), but a message reading "Expected flips and actual flips out of synch" often pops up, around every 5-8 items. Does this seriously corrupt the data or is it negligible? Any advice on fixing this is greatly appreciated. </DIV>
