   Why not?  The duration of the item is determined by the duration of the 
digital video.

   No one's ever tried to do fMRI constant interval stuff with digital 
video before.  If I were doing it I would specify the duration of the <dv> 
frame and not rely on the codec to determine it's duration.


>3. Can I trust in the values that are being given by the clock when I am

   No, that's the time that the codec get's told to start decoding the 
video.  You would need to use the <DV*> keyword but I don't know for a fact 
that it's tied to <rcot>, doesn't look like it is.
