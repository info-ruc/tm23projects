   Yeah, there's something badly awry in there and the most trivial changes 
to an item file can have huge effects.  And the bits that are broken are 
low level routines that I have no control over so something else is 
breaking them and I have _no_ clues as to what that might be.  Which leaves 
me arbitrarily disabling parts of DMDX to see if the side effects go away 
but that's difficult and time consuming to do.  Hopefully something will 
occur to me out of the blue tonight otherwise it'll be another painful 
debugging session tomorrow.

Experience is what you get when you were expecting something else.
