   You have to use the GeForce4 Ti driver if that's what your video card 
is.  No, DX 8.1 isn't DX 9 (although who knows what 8.1+ is).  Guess you'll 
have to send me your item file (or a portion of it big enough to experience 
the error if it's huge) so I can see if I can replicate the problem here.

   Yeah, you install and set up the Instacall Drivers that come with the 
DIO24 and use them in TimeDX.
