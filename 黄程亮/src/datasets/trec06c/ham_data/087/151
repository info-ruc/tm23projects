   After many days of the most painful debugging I've ever had to do (and 
that's saying something after twenty five years of programming) much along 
the lines of searching for a needle in a haystack without knowing what a 
needle is (sure would've made things easier if I'd had the library source) 
I think I've finally figured out what was failing.  My initial kludge in 
3.0.1.2 was in fact the right thing to do and the only real mystery was why 
the protection fault wasn't thrown from the very earliest days of DMDX 3 
when I switched to MS VC 6.  Turns out sscanf() calls strlen() which is 
fine when you're processing a NULL terminated string but when scramble() is 
processing parameters it's not processing a NULL terminated string, it's 
parsing a memory mapped file which isn't NULL terminated.  Should've always 
thrown a fault but it didn't.

   DMDX 3.0.1.3 includes the kludge which has now become a fix and 
additionally allows the hitting of ESC to stop a super long syntax check.
