   I can replicate it so it's not your hardware.  Oddly enough naming task 
negation turns off once through the practice and I don't see any request to 
do so in the item file so I'm guessing the problem is related to the 
current weirdness that I'm trying to track down.  Possibly DMDX needs more 
stack space than is allocated by default and when we switched compilers 
something else needs to be set, who knows but I sure hope I do and quickly too.

Experience is what you get when you were expecting something else.
