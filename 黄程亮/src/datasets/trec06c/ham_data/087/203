   There's a new IMG2BMP.EXE that appears to fix some problems the old one 
had when it generated solid black images.  Didn't really fix anything, just 
compiled it with the new compiler and when it did the same thing as the old 
one I told it to generate 32 bit BMP files instead of 2 bit and things 
started working.
