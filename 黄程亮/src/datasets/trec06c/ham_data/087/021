   How interesting, that's a check I put in DMDX years ago when I was 
writing it and have literally never seen a machine broken enough to produce 
that message.  Didn't even see it as DMDX was being developed and I was 
pretty happy about that personally as it meant an awful lot of very complex 
code was functioning perfectly -- which I found difficult to believe in the 
early stages but believe me I checked that so many ways I just had to 
accept it.  I expect the display would get seriously out of synch if you 
are getting this message, DMDX would expect one frame to be on the screen 
when in fact the previous or next frame is displayed instead.  Have you 
applied NVIDIA reference drivers?  I use the 40.72 drivers on my XP 
machines. I use NVIDIA cards everywhere and have never seen a machine throw 
that message and I've seen machines in some pretty seriously broken 
states.  Is this a DirectX 9 machine?  I haven't done too much testing of 
one yet but what testing I did do showed me that NVIDIA's drivers were 
still poor for DMDX -- they didn't crash the machine anymore but I saw 
white displays when there should have been text displayed which is related 
to what you are describing.

Experience is what you get when you were expecting something else.
