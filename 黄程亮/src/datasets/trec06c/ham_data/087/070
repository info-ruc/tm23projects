Dear DMDxers,

I would like to use DMDX to display films and pictures in an fMRI 
experiment. Responses from the subject are not needed.
Some details:
1. The avi's and bmp's will be presented as separate items.
2. Each bmp and each avi will be displayed for 14 seconds.
3. I would like the scanner to trigger each item.
4. The scanner trigger sends a pulse each 1550 ms.

I would like each new film or bmp to begin 17050 ms after the beginning of 
the previous one. So, the duration of the item + delay parameter has to be 
less than 17050 ms (1550 ms * 11 scanner triggers) and greater than 15500 
ms (1550 ms * 10 scanner triggers).
So 15500 ms < (the delay parameter + film or bmp) < 17050 ms.

I have tried the following rtf file:

<d 180> <zil> <rcot> <id "Keyboard"> <id pio12> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 0> 
<nfb> <t 200> <dbc 0> <dwc 255255255>
0 "Waiting for the scanner.";
+1 <dv -1, -1> *"SP_S2"/;
+2 <fd 1050> <bmp>*"F"/;
+3 <dv -1, -1> *"NS_R7"/;
+4 <dv -1, -1> *"C_S1"/;
+5 <dv -1, -1> *"SN_W2"/;
+6 <dv -1, -1> *"C_V4"/;
+7 <fd 1050> <bmp>*"F"/;
+8 <dv -1, -1> *"SP_U1"/;
0 "The End. Thank you.";

And the zil file that was produced:

*********************************************************************

The time duration of the various items (+ delay parameter) is:

SP_S2              16704.71
<bmp> F           14909.52
NS_R7              16841.19
C_S1                16834.11
SN_W2             16862.32
C_V4                16735.31
<bmp> F           14893.07

Additional information that might be useful:
The DMDX version that I am using is an old version 2.6.04 (can this be a 
problem here?).
I think that the computer is good enough (Genuine Intel, X86, 512 MB RAM, 
the video card is not perfect but it is a NVIDIA Geforce2 GTS/Geforce2 Pro 
Dell M770).
The avi were compressed with the codec Microsoft MPEG-4 Video Codec V3.

My doubts are:

1. For the films - Since the DMDX stops at the end of each item (d 180 + 
film + extra tick = 16413.33 ms), the new clock-on should be activated at 
17050 ms (11 trigger scans after the previous clock-on). Even if there was 
an error of more or less 500 ms on the display of the film, the time 
shouldn't change. And if the display error of the film is superior to 650 
ms, the clock times should change for 17050 +/- 1550 ms, and not any other 
values.

2. Why are the bmp taking 14909 and 14893 ms? Why do they not take always 
17050 ms?  ( d 180 + fd 1050 + extra tick = 16412.33 ms)
Even if the delay of 180 is not "used" and the item takes exactly 14000 ms 
to load and play, the time should be 17050 - 1550 = 15500 ms.

3. Can I trust in the values that are being given by the clock when I am 
displaying films? That the beginning is really the beginning?

Any clues about what might be happening would be really appreciated.

Many thanks

Paula
