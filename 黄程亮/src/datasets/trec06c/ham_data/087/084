Hello.

Has anyone ever programmed the TERNUS effect OR a VISUAL MOTION 
PERCEPTION task via DMDX?  Could you possibly share code with me to 
help out with the development of such a task?

I am a complete (and utter) novice with DMDX ..soon to be user and 
programmer ..seeking HELP.

I would like to create a visual motion perception test (called the 
TERNUS) that involves moving three squares back and forth on a screen 
with variable interstimulus intervals between the presentations.

Below is what needs to be done, can anyone share any code that they 
may have to get me going in the right direction? ..EVEN BETTER ..has 
anyone actually programmed the TERNUS before? ..here is the info. for 
it:

The Ternus display consists of three bright (white) squares on a dark 
(black) bacground.  The three squares are presented for 55 ms (frame 
1) and then represented 'x' ms later ...over one equidistant square 
to the right (frame 2).  There are 20 trials at each ISI (a trial 
consists of eight successive fram 1-2 presentations).  The order of 
ISIs between frame 1 and frame 2 is randomized. ...the number of 
different ISIs that we will use will be around 7 or so.

ANY HELP APPRECIATED.

..probably a pretty basic question, but as a complete newbie it's 
foreign to me now.

THANK YOU.

Laurie
