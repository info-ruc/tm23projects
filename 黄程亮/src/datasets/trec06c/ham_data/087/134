Hi,

I've set up an experiment such that a fixation point will remain on
screen 
while numbers are sequentially presented above the fixation.  The 
continuous fixation is giving me timing problems.

Here's a sample of the script:

<ep> <NumberOfItems 432> <AZKII> <VideoMode 800,600,600,8,0> 
<ContinuousRun> <Delay 0> <Timeout 1500> <fd 36> <id "keyboard"> <id 
"mouse"> <DefaultBackgroundColor 000000000> <DefaultWritingColor
255255255> 
<zil> <ztr> <nfb> <mr "+Right Ctrl"> <mpr +button 0> <mnr +button 1>
<vzk 
"+button 0"> <vzk "-button 1"> <eop>

0 <line -2> "Please respond in the same way", <line -1> "as the practice

run.", <line 0> "The most important thing is to", <line 1> "respond 
correctly (right mouse click)", <line 2> "to the grey coloured
numbers.", 
<line 4> "Press the SPACEBAR to start";

+1 <ms% 161> <Ln 0> “+”/! * <ms% 500> <bmp 0.46,0.30> “b41"/ <ms% 500> 
+<Ln
0> “+”/!;
+1 <ms% 161> <Ln 0> “+”/! * <ms% 500> <bmp 0.46,0.30> “b42"/ <ms% 500> 
+<Ln

+9 <ms% 161> <Ln 0> “+”/! * <ms% 500> <bmp 0.46,0.30> “b43"/ <ms% 500>

<Ln 0> “+”/!;
+1 <ms% 161> <Ln 0> “+”/! * <ms% 500> <bmp 0.46,0.30> “b56"/ <ms% 500> 
+<Ln
0> “+”/!;
+1 <ms% 161> <Ln 0> “+”/! * <ms% 500> <bmp 0.475,0.35> “b27"/ <ms% 500> 
+<Ln
0> “+”/!;
+1 <ms% 161> <Ln 0> “+”/! * <ms% 500> <bmp 0.465,0.32> “b38"/ <ms% 500> 
+<Ln
0> “+”/!;
+1 <ms% 161> <Ln 0> “+”/! * <ms% 500> <bmp 0.475,0.365> “b19"/ <ms% 500>
<Ln 0> “+”/!;

The output gives me display errors as follows:  !  Display error at msec

25682, tick 1846 in item 1, frame "+" !  moved into video memory 1 tick 
late!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)

These errors do not occur for every line but quite frequently across the

task.  Any ideas on how to remedy this?

Many thanks, Paul.
