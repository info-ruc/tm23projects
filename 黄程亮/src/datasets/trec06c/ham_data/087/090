   Just a note to the lurkers on the list, I'm not answering complete 
newbie questions so someone else will have to get things like Laurie's 
Ternus Efect question.  I'm happy to answer technical questions that no one 
but me could answer but straight forward stuff is the responsibility of 
list members.
