Hello everyone,

I would appreciate help on a problem that I have in setting up an 
experiment in DMDX. I have two pieces of code that work separately, but 
I can't seem to be able to combine them for my purposes.

I would like to run an experiment that requires touch-typed responses, 
with separate latencies for each keystroke. No problem - <zil> does 
exactly what I want. The following script records, for one second per 
stimulus, anything that was typed:


n3<zil><t 1000><nfb><cr>
=1 * "dog";
=2 * "cat";
=3 * "mouse";


Now I would like to add a response deadline that displays a message 
after the trial if the FIRST key stroke was later than a certain time 
interval. I have implemented response deadlines before, but only with 
"normal" (i.e., two-alternative) responses. For instance, the following 
script (which I believe was posted in similar form to this list some 
time ago) requires one of the two shift keys as a response, and if the 
key press did not occur within 500 ms after stimulus onset, the message 
"Too slow!" is displayed after the trial. The sole purpose of the "0 <bu 
70>" line is to skip the "60" and "69" lines when the file is read by DMDX.


n3<nfb><cr>
0 <bu 70>;
60 <set 1, LastRT><bicLE 1, 500, 69>;
0 <ms% 500> "Too slow!" / c;
69 <ret>;
70 ;
=1 * "dog" /  ! <call -60>;
=2 * "cat" / ! <call -60>;
=3 * "mouse" / ! <call -60>;


So here is my question: is there a way to access the FIRST rt (out of 
many) that is recorded with the <zil> option, and make a response 
deadline dependent on it?

Many thanks,


Markus
