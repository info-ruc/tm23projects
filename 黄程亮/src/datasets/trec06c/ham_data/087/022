This is an example of a current item, plus the header.

Header:
<n 128> <s 1> <d 0>  <id keyboard>, <cr> <mnr "+f"> <mpr "+j"> <vg 1>
<clfb>

Item file:
+147 <t 8000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> c* "Last Tuesday at 6 pm";
+147 c* "Leigh waited for Ted";
+147 c* "while";
+147 <fd 13> " " / c* "eating dinner.";
+147 <umpr> <mpr "+j"> *"Leigh was eating dinner?";
+147 <t 600000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> c* "*NEXT*";

Is there any way to rewrite this so that DMDX still displays it
line-by-line, but does not time every single line. I do not not want the
reaction times for every line to appear in the .azk file.

When I simply remove "*", "c", or "c *" from the lines I don't want timed,
however, I am always given an error message which states that there is a
missing clock on the item.

Could someone please tell me how to rewrite this item so that it only
times the desired lines, for example,

+147 <t 8000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space">  "Last Tuesday at 6 pm";
don't time
+147 "Leigh waited for Ted";
don't time
+147 "while";
don't time
+147 <fd 13> " " / c* "eating dinner.";
TIME
+147 <umpr> <mpr "+j"> *"Leigh was eating dinner?";
TIME
+147 <t 600000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> c* "*NEXT*";
don't time

Thank-you very much.
