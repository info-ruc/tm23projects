Hi Paul,

The trick is to use the "do not erase" character (!) at the end of each 
item. In the following fragment, each word is followed by a fixation cross 
which stays on the screen throughout the delay between trials and is 
replaced by the next word:

+1 * "HERMIT" / "+" <% 120> /!;
+2 * "BENCH" / "+" <% 120> /!;
+3 * "BRANCH" / "+" <% 120> /!;
+4 * "BLEACH" / "+" <% 120> /!;
etc.

Cheers,

Matt
