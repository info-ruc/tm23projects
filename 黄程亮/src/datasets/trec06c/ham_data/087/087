DMDXers,

We are about to buy several notebooks which will be used for running 
DMDX.  We have experienced difficulties in the past with Toshiba Satellite 
notebooks running Windows 2000.

Can anyone recommend a reasonably-priced current brand and model that has 
been tested and found to work well?

Also, can anyone give me an opinion on the suitability of the notebook's 
TFT display screen for applications such as masked priming and video.  For 
example, are there still issues about decay rate, etc which make using an 
external monitor preferable?

Thanks,
Colin
