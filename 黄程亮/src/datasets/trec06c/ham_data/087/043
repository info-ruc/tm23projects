<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;I now have a naming experiment running (using a NVIDIA GeForce4 Ti 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;4200 card with AGP8X), but a message reading "Expected flips and 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;actual flips out of synch" often pops up, around every 5-8 items. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;Does this seriously corrupt the data or is it negligible? Any 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;advice on fixing this is greatly appreciated. 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;fact the previous or next frame is displayed instead. Have you 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;applied NVIDIA reference drivers? I use the 40.72 drivers on my XP 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;machines. I use NVIDIA cards everywhere and have never seen a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;machine throw that message and I've seen machines in some pretty 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;seriously broken states. Is this a DirectX 9 machine? I haven't 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;done too much testing of one yet but what testing I did do showed me 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;that NVIDIA's drivers were still poor for DMDX -- they didn't crash 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the machine anymore but I saw white displays when there should have 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;been text displayed which is related to what you are describing.

<DIV>After receiving your email, I&nbsp;installed the 40.72 driver, but same problem - 'Flips out of synch'. I've even tried&nbsp;minimising the buffered display to 1, but same problem.&nbsp;The computer lists&nbsp;DirectX&nbsp;8.1+, so I'm not sure if that's already DirectX 9.&nbsp;Is it better to just&nbsp;not use a&nbsp;GeForce4 Ti driver?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>On another issue, I have a PCI-DIO24 installed. It lists two I/O Ranges D800-D87F and D400-D403. After reading the archived messages, I entered D800 as the PIO Address when I did the PIO Test in TimeDX. But when I press start, TimeDX just shuts&nbsp;down, saying it has encountered a problem and needs to close. I've tried entering the whole I/O range as well, but same result. Is there&nbsp;a solution to this? </DIV>
