I have a Dell Inspiron 4150 (only a few months old but already obsolete
-- I think the equivalent would be the Inspiron 5100) with Windows XP
and I get robust masked repetition priming effects with it (45 ms effect
with 50 ms primes).  I can't speak to whether a CRT monitor is still
preferable or not, though.
