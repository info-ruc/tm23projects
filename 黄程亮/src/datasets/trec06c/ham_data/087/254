I am creating a lesson planning tool to be used by public school
teachers in Texas.  The lesson planner enables the integration of TEKS
requirements into lesson plans.

I would like permission to reproduce the content of TEKS requirements
within my program.  The official source for TEKS requirements will be
clearly stated.  It will also be clearly stated that the lesson planner
is not an official source for TEKS information.

Thank you for your help,
Andrew Hintz
