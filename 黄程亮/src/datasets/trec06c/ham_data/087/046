Hi,

Have a quick question regarding the presentation of fixation points in DMDX.

I like to run an experiment whereby a small fixation, presented centrally, 
would remain on screen for the duration of the experiment (so, in effect it 
would be the default background). Do know how I might do this? So far I've 
only managed to present fixations that appear on every trial so I get a 
periodic flicker as a new fixation is presented each time.

Many thanks,

Paul.
