Thank-you, that did work, but it's created a new problem. The item files now
look as follow:
 
 
 <n 128> <s 1> <d 0>  <id keyboard>, <cr> <mnr "+f"> <mpr "+j"> <vg 1> <clfb>
 
 
 1 <umpr> <umr> <mpr “+Space”> *“One day at the mall”;
 1 “Michael was stopped by Jack”;
 1 “while”;
 +1 <fd 13> " " / *“leaving the store.”;
 +1 <umpr> <mpr “+j”> *“Michael was leaving the store?”;
 1 <t 600000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> "*NEXT*";
 
 9 <umpr> <umr> <mpr “+Space”> “One day outside the movie theatre”;
 9 “Jacob was harassed by Brian”;
 9 “while”;
 +9 <fd 13> " " / c *“he stood in line.”;
 +9 <umpr> <mpr “+j”> *“Jacob stood in line?”;
 9 <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> "*NEXT*";
 
 However, with <cr> in the header file, it does not wait for the subject to 
 respond before moving to the next item. We want this requirement to remain in
 
 place. When I removed the <cr>, however, it froze on the first line. I am 
 unsure why it does not understand that pressing the spacebar should be 
 interpreted as a request to continue. In other words, what can I do to make
 it 
 read line by line rather than freezing, but still requiring the subject's 
 response to move on.
 
 Thank-you.
