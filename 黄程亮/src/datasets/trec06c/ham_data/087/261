I tried to run a sample control file with the latest version of DMDX.
Somehow, it does not take any keyboard response (left/right shift keys and
spacebar). "No response" sign appears regardless of my keyboard input.

OS is Korean version of ME. I use Korean keyboard. I change the keyboard
name that matches with input device in TimeDX. In input test, left shift
is #42, right shift is #54, and the spacebar is #57.

I welcome any kind of advice ASAP. Thanks.
