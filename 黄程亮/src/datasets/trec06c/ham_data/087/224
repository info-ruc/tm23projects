   Yes, of course, you want <wc> because the color of that frame has 
already been copied from the default color.  I guess I could remove that 
little gotcha except that then if someone had actually used <wc> and <dwc> 
together the <dwc> would override the <wc> if it was different.  Guess I 
could check for that also, make <dwc> change the color of the frame it is 
in if hasn't already been changed from the previous default writing 
color...  And then of course someone will have an item file that actually 
relies on <dwc> not affecting the current frame and there's also the 
scenario that I can't imagine because it's so bizarre but works nonetheless 
that I know someone will have -- so the legacy stupidity stays put.
