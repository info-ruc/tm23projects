Private contact (RE: TRANSFER  (US$20.5M)



Sir,



This letter might come as a surprise to you especially since we have never met or discuss before. Basically, the message might sound strange but it is factual in reality if only you care to know.



The truth is that I should have notified you first through a more confidential means, (even if it's at least to respect your integrity) please accept my humble apologies if i had caught you unawares, i


frankly do not mean any harm in passing my message. We are members of the Special Committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources. This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the approval of contract in order of priorities as regards capital projects of the federal excutive government of Nigeria with our positions we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of Twenty million five hundred thousand dollars (us$20.5M) the amount was accumulated from the over invoice.



Hence, together with some of the top officials of the  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and the Federal Ministry of Finance. We plan to transfer this amount of money Twenty  million five hundred thousand dollars (us$20.5M) into an overseas account by awarding a non existing contract from my ministry (NNPC). To this effect i decided to contact you and ask for your assistance.  What we need from you sir, is to provide a very vital account in which the funds will be transferred. 

My colleagues and I have agreed to compensate the owner of the account used for this transaction with 25% of the total amount remitted. We shall keep 73% and remaining 2% reserved for taxes and other miscellaneous expenses.  Finally, the confidence and trust reposed on you cannot be over emphasised. Therefore, you are to keep this deal to yourself confidentially. Calibre of personnels involved are men in government.So cannot effort to loose our respective reputation to our dear country if jeopardise by you.



Contact me urgently with private detial infomations for our easier communication.




YOURS FAITHFULLY,

MR USMAN BELLO,

CHAIRMAN CONTACT AWARD & MONITORING COMMITTEE



- Bello Usman
