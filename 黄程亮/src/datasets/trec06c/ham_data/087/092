Hello everyone

I have been trying to install the latest version on DMDX today on a
windows 98 machine. The installation seems to run ok, but whenever I try
to open TimeDX or DmDX I get the following windows messagec:\Windows\Application
data\microsoft\installer\{c7d19bdf-b1b2-4f0c-899b-6cfb78c48141}\_66a8199.exe
is not a valid Win32 application.
I have searched the list but it seems I am the first one to get this

Alternatively I have tried to use a previous version of DmDX which runs
into keyboard detection problems that are not solverd by the strategies
mentionned in previous messages (e.g. declaring "keyboard" as "clavier")
Your help is appreciated !

bye

xavier
