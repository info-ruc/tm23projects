Dear jonathan
Thank you very much. I have found the error in my script.  I did not notice that the keyword "dwc" means the color of the next frame other than corrent frame.

No, the feedback is "Correct 381" when it should be.

Use the Input Test in TimeDX, select the keyboard and click Test and all 
the key names will fill the list box. Press J and the J key entry should 
be displayed.

You may be running into some kind of weirdness on account of the 
keyboard you have, perhaps you should consider the #keyboard device that 
was added to clear up input weird international keyboard issues (see Input 
help in DMDX). Then you can use +#36 instead of +J and +#33 instead of +F 
in the mapping keywords. You will have to be using a fairly recent version 
of DMDX though.
