   Hmm, could be DirectX 9 but seeing as you probably can't get rid of it 
you'll have to try some newer video drivers.  If you're using the most 
recent ones then you can try some different color depths, either 8 bit (not 
recommended but you may have no choice) or 24 or 32 bit.  If you have 
another video card perhaps you can try that.  OTOH perhaps this is another 
manifestation of whatever instability it is that VC 6 has introduced into 
DMDX and if nothing else alters the behavior you'll have to wait till I can 
figure out what's wrong -- I suspect I have located the basic region of the 
failure, it appears to be the RTF parser.
