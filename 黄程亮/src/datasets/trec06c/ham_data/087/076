   Looks like whatever's busted has been busted since version 3 of DMDX was 
done last year when I moved to MS Visual C for a compiler.  Pretty 
impressive for something this major to remain undetected for so 
long.  Current advice is for people to stick to 2.9.05 if they aren't using 
new features.  Otherwise avoid the use of classic switches and parameters, 
use the keyword variants instead as most of the symptoms appear to be 
triggered parsing things like D20 and M2011 whereas <d 20> and <mdsp 2011> 
appear to have a higher chance of avoiding the broken stuff.
