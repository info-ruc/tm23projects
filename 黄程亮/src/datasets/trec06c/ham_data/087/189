Alternatively, you can try setting "#####" as a feedback message and set 
its duration with the FeedbackDuration keyword. The feedback message 
will be displayed immediately after the display of the last frame, as in 
the example below.

<ExtendedParameters>
<FrameDuration 60>
<ClearFeedback>
<FeedbackDuration 60>
<FeedbackLine 0>
<ContinuousRun>
<EndOfParameters>
=1 * <cfb "#####"> "response";
=2 * <cfb "#####"> "response";
