I have been trying to get a Windows 95 machine up and running with DMDX.
 Do you know where I can get a Kernel32.dll file so that I can get DMDX.exe
to work?  Also, the version of Direct X that I have is 8.0. I have searched
the archives with no success to find an answer to this question.  The internet
has provided much commentary with no instructions on how to proceed.

The error is      Kernel32.dll:SetThreadExecutionState

I hope that this provides enough information to make suggestions.   I look
forward to the response.
