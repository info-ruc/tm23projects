Hello jonathan,

    I'm doing a audial experiment and I want to give subjects the wrong feedback,
but my subjects are special--my subjects are all blind. Of course I can't give the
visual feedback, and I'm afraid of the interfering that different audio stimuli
may cause If I give the audial feedback. 
    So I decide to give such feedback: When the blind subject do a wrong response,
the program will stop there with a wrong character in the middle of screen. And
then my blind subjects find they are wrong, they can press the spacebar to
continue. But the problem is that I don't know how to make the program stop when
it is in the feedback progress.
    Please help me!
