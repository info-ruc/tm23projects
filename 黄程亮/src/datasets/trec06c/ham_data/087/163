   Having figured out the sscanf() issue I can get back to handling some of 
the problems that have occurred over the last few weeks and prime amongst 
them was a set of chained item files that weren't saving the data at the 
end of the earlier item files as they chained to the later ones.  Turns out 
the problem stems from using <sd> in the last item with the chain keyword, 
the code winds up having to terminate the job as if it was a syntax check 
as the normal job termination stuff is handled from the display queue -- 
but a skip display item builds nothing on the display queue.  I'm impressed 
it worked as well as it did.  Documentation has been updated.
