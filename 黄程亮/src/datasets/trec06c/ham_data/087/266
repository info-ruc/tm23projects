I am in the process of trying to upgrade the computers in my lab and was 
thinking of ordering the following machines.

Dell precision 350SMT 2.66GHz processor, with a 64MEG fireGL e1 VGA/DVI 
(dual monitor capable) video card, and a 16 bit sound blaster compatible 
sound card which evidently comes as part of the motherboard.
Can anyone please advise me as to the suitability of these machines for 
running DMDX and any problems that may occur in trying to use DMDX on this 
type of machine?
Thanks
Karen
