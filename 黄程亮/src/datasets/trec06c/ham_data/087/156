Hello Again ....

I am beseged by DDERR Invalid Pixel Format errors (88760091) in a
computer I am just setting up with DMDX (last weeks version).

SYSTEM:
*  Dell Optiplex GXa computer (266 Mhz PII) with latest BIOS
*  Appian Graphics Jeronimo P2 dualhead graphics card (3d Labs Permedia
     2 chipset) with latest drivers
*  Windows XP
*  Directx 9.0

Previous posts on this subject have suggested (1) lowering the number of
screen color display bits and (2) finding some video modes that will
work under DMDX.  I have failed to achieve results with either / both.
TimeDx 'crashes' with the Invalid Pixel Format Errors when I try and
test the video mode.


QUESTIONS:

1.  Is this a pure video card issue or does it involve the computer as 
well?

2.  There is no mention of the 3D Labs Permedia chipset in the DMDX
documentation of listserv archives.  Have I just discovered a new
incompatibility?

3.  I need to use a dualhead PCI card in this computer because the Dell
has an onboard AGP graphics chip that shuts down if another video card
is detected (unlike my Intel board).  The Dell does not like 2 PCI video
cards either!

If I buy a Matrox G400 (listed in the docs as compatible) ... do I have
a reasonable certainty of avoiding this problem?  I have a Matrox G550
that runs TimeDx beautifully on a different computer (see question 1).

Thanks,

Derek




// Bill Gates's explanation:

Message:
The pixel format is invalid.

Explanation:
A valid pixel format identifies a pixel configuration supported on a
drawing surface. DescribePixelFormat describes all the pixel formats
supported on a given drawing surface. SetPixelFormat changes the pixel
format of a window or drawing surface. The pixel format of a window or
drawing surface can be modified only once. Once it is set, it cannot be
changed to a different pixel format.

User Action:
If you can, verify that the pixel format is supported by the drawing
surface. If the pixel format was changed on another occasion, it cannot
be changed again. Contact the supplier of the running distributed
application.
