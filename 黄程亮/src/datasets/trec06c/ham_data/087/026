Thank-you, that did work, but it's created a new problem. The item files now 
look as follow:


<n 128> <s 1> <d 0>  <id keyboard>, <cr> <mnr "+f"> <mpr "+j"> <vg 1> <clfb> 

1 <umpr> <umr> <mpr “+Space”> *“One day at the mall”;
1 “Michael was stopped by Jack”;
1 “while”;
+1 <fd 13> " " / *“leaving the store.”;
+1 <umpr> <mpr “+j”> *“Michael was leaving the store?”;
1 <t 600000> <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> "*NEXT*";

9 <umpr> <umr> <mpr “+Space”> “One day outside the movie theatre”;
9 “Jacob was harassed by Brian”;
9 “while”;
+9 <fd 13> " " / c *“he stood in line.”;
+9 <umpr> <mpr “+j”> *“Jacob stood in line?”;
9 <umpr> <umr> <mpr "+Space"> "*NEXT*";

However, with <cr> in the header file, it does not wait for the subject to 
respond before moving to the next item. We want this requirement to remain in 
place. When I removed the <cr>, however, it froze on the first line. I am 
unsure why it does not understand that pressing the spacebar should be 
interpreted as a request to continue. In other words, what can I do to make it 
read line by line rather than freezing, but still requiring the subject's 
response to move on.

Thank-you.
