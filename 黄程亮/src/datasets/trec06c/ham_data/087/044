   Yeah, you're stuck with that, there's no way to dump the display queue.

   "house" is being displayed during the inter item interval as DMDX 
loops.  You want to set  the <delay> parameter real low if your machine can 
do it and change your item to the following and take whatever you set 
<delay> to plus one off the initial value of counter 2.  You have to add 
one because the new last frame takes a tick to move onto the display:

+1 <%ctr 2> * "########" / <%ctr 3>  * " house " <dec 1> <inc 2> <dec 3> 
<bicGT 1,0,-1> / "########";

   You'll never be able to have a %1 "########" as is but you could always 
hard code the last few iterations in the following item.  To handle the 
looping you could use <BranchIfNoResponse> to continue the loop and a 
<bicGT> to break out but of course you can't have two branches in the same 
item and you can't have counter branches in a <mwb> so you'll have to have 
something like this (assuming <delay 2>):

~1000 <set 1,29> <set 2, 26> <set 3,1>;
~1001 <bicLT 1,4,1005>;
+1002 <%ctr 2> * "########" / <%ctr 3>  * " house " <dec 1> <inc 2> <dec 3> 
<binr -1001> / "########";
~1003 <binr 1005> <! can't have BranchIfNotNoResponse...>;
~1004 <bu 2000>;
+1005 %3  "########" / * %27 " house " / %2  "########" /  %28 " house " / 
%1  "########" /  %29 " house " / ;

   Not sure if my counter limits are exactly right but you should be 
getting the idea.  You'll probably want to <emit> some counters too.
