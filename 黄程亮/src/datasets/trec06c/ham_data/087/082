   Ah, good point.

   Probably because that's the time between pulses from the scanner.  The 
only thing DMDX could be doing is taking too long to display the item and 
thus missing a pulse and it's not doing that.  The only way it could be 
going too fast is if there is an early trigger.  It's certainly not getting 
continuous triggers because we'd see them in the zil file and all we see 
there are the occasional -Bit0 as the trigger is released.

   Unless this has been done before I would try a simple item file along 
the lines of:

<d 180> <zil> <rcot> <id "Keyboard"> <id pio12> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 0>
<nfb> <t 200> <dbc 0> <dwc 255255255>
0 "Waiting for the scanner.";
+1 * "1"/;
+2 * "2"/;
+3 * "3"/;
+4 * "4"/;
+5 * "5"/;

   That way you can make sure the scanner is doing what you're thinking.  I 
guess it's possible that your interface card is whacky, if you're using one 
of the Keithly things running in some kind of emulation mode the sky's the 
limit in my past experience with them.  It's possible that using <rcot> and 
thus using a * with digital video is the cause of your problems.

   It'd be the first we've heard about it and given <rcot>'s constant use 
over in the scanner here and abroad I'd be impressed if the error was in DMDX.

Experience is what you get when you were expecting something else.
