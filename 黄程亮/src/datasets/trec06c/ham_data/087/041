Hi.  I have been playing around with DMDX to try and come up with a good 
way of doing progressive demasking.  I failed and was wondering if anyone 
had any ideas.  Here's the problem (refresh rate = 10ms for all examples 
below).  If you do it in a single frame, as below, it works well in terms 
of visibility of the item...

+1 %29  "########" /  %1 * " house " / %28  "########" /  %2 " house " / 
%27  "########" /  %3 " house " / %26  "########" /  %4 " house " / 
%25  "########" /  %5 " house " / %24  "########" /  %6 " house " / 
%23  "########" /  %7 " house " / %22  "########" /  %8 " house " / 
%21  "########" /  %9 " house " / %20  "########" /  %10 " house " / 
%19  "########" /  %11 " house " / %18  "########" /  %12 " house " / 
%17  "########" /  %13 " house " / %16  "########" /  %14 " house " / 
%15  "########" /  %15 " house " / %14  "########" /  %16 " house " / 
%13  "########" /  %17 " house " / %12  "########" /  %18 " house " / 
%11  "########" /  %19 " house " / %10  "########" /  %20 " house " / 
%9  "########" /  %21 " house " / %8  "########" /  %22 " house " / 
%7  "########" /  %23 " house " / %6  "########" /  %24 " house " / 
%5  "########" /  %25 " house " / %4  "########" /  %26 " house " / 
%3  "########" /  %27 " house " / %2  "########" /  %28 " house " / 
%1  "########" /  %29 " house " / ;

...however, DMDX has to wait until the frame is finished before it moves on 
to the next item, which means each frame is 29*300ms=8.7 seconds long, so 
the experiment will take forever if there are, as planned, 600 items (at 
least 1.5 hours).  The other option is to use counters to loop and also to 
increment and decrement the item and the mask as done below (although I 
still need to sort out how to do the multiway branching such that when the 
subject responds it quits the loop and goes on to the next item)...

1000 <set 1,29> <set 2, 29> <set 3,1>  ;

+1 <%ctr 2> * "########" / <%ctr 3>  * " house " <dec 1> <inc 2> <dec 3> 
<bicGT 1,0,-1>;

...However, with this method of looping a single item, the word is much 
more visible.

Any ideas?  Thank you!

- Mike

P.S.  The choice of 300 milliseconds for each mask and target pair is based 
on the Grainger and Jacobs (1996) progressive demasking work.
