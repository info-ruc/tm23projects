"Too much Free Software? And you thought people were complaining about a
lack of applications which makes them stick with Microsoft Windows. Well,
they're right. On Linux, there's no decent movie player and no working
sound recorder (like the one in Windows 95) shipped as the default by
GNOME, but hey, there are more than 385 text editors! Choice is good, but
it's frustrating when none of the alternatives works properly."
