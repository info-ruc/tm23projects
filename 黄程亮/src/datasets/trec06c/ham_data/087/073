Hi.  Thanks for the help with the script.  It works great.  I am going to 
stick an annotated version of this on my web pages.  However, I am not 
wholly certain of what item 1003 is doing and I don't want to end up 
writing gibberish about it.  When there is a response is made before the 
loop over 1002 has run its' course, then DMDX moves onto the next 
item....and this is where I get stuck.  Why can't I just have item 1004 
alone?  Why do I need 1003 as well?  Sorry to be thick about this.

Thanks - Mike
