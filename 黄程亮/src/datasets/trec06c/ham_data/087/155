In the following program the number '5' should be presented for 36 ticks 
(approx 500 ms for my PC) and the timeout is 1500.

There are 8 trials therefore the total running time should be 12 
seconds.  When I run the program in lasts for approx 18 secs. I'm using 
DMDX version 3.0.1.2 and TimeDX version 3.0.6.0.  The video mode I selected 
was 800x600 (0hz) 8 bit (256 color) palatte.  I also carried out the 
time-video advanced tests.

Any ideas as to why this timing delay is occuring?

Many thanks, Paul.
