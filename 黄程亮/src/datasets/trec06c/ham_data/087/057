<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;On another issue, I have a PCI-DIO24 installed. It lists two I/O </P></DIV>
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;Ranges D800-D87F and D400-D403. After reading the archived 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;messages, I entered D800 as the PIO Address when I did the PIO Test 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;in TimeDX. But when I press start, TimeDX just shuts down, saying 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;it has encountered a problem and needs to close. I've tried 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;entering the whole I/O range as well, but same result. Is there a 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt;solution to this? 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; 
<DIV></DIV>&gt; Yeah, you install and set up the Instacall Drivers that come with 
<DIV></DIV>&gt;the DIO24 and use them in TimeDX.

<DIV>Sorry! On an email previous to this, I said I 'think' the InstaCal Drivers are installed. I realised that they're not, and have now been able to run the PIO Test under TimeDX. Sorry for any inconvenience. </DIV>
