Dear Jonathan,

Thank you for your answer. Sorry to bother you again...


>>1. For the films - Since the DMDX stops at the end of each item (d 180 + 
>>film + extra tick = 16413.33 ms), the new clock-on should be activated at 
>>17050 ms (11 trigger scans after the previous clock-on). Even if there

Because the command line of rtf file *does not* have the <cr> option activated:
"<d 180> <zil> <rcot> <id "Keyboard"> <id pio12> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 0> 
<nfb> <t 200> <dbc 0> <dwc 255255255>"
So each time a film finishes the DMDX should stop there, waiting for the 
next scanner trigger (or keyboard input).

Even with an error of +/- 500 ms in the display of the film (what is a lot 
already,  film duration is 14000 ms) the next item can only be activated by 
the next scanner trigger (which happens at 17050 ms).

Any Item:  Delay  +         film         + waiting next trigger
Time:     2400 ms + 14000ms (+/- 500 ms) + waiting next trigger

With an error of -500 ms in the display of the film.

Time: 15900 ms (the DmDX stops here, waiting for the next scanner trigger 
at 17050 ms,  the previous one was at 15550 ms)

With an error of +500 ms in the display of the film.

Time: 16900 ms (and again the DmDX stops here, waiting for the next scanner 
trigger at 17050 ms)

Why is DMDX giving me a time of 16800(+/-)100 ms?



>>2. Why are the bmp taking 14909 and 14893 ms? Why do they not take always 
>>17050 ms?  ( d 180 + fd 1050 + extra tick = 16412.33 ms)
>>Even if the delay of 180 is not "used" and the item takes exactly 14000 
>>ms to load and play, the time should be 17050 - 1550 = 15500 ms.

Thank you for your suggestion regarding the films, but question 2 refers to 
the time problem that is happening with the pictures. Any idea about what 
might be happening here? The code line was

"+2 <fd 1050> <bmp>*"F"/;"

1050 * 13.33 = 13997 ms
d 180        = 2400 ms
sum          = 16397 ms

The DMDX should stop after displaying it, and again the next item should be 
trigger after 11 scanner triggers (17050 ms).

Why is DMDX giving me a time of roughly 14900 ms?


****
Could all these problems be due to a bug in the DMDX version 2.6.04? (The 
machine that I am using has only this version installed, and I am not 
allowed to update it).

Thank you again for your attention and patience.

Paula
