Can anyone help me?  I'm looking for a UK supplier for the Handyboard, 
either as a kit or complete.
I would also like some advice about how I could integrate the Handyboard 
into a A-Level physic department. I'm interesting in introducing robotics 
or/and control, to 17 year old students as an extra curricular activity.

Any ideas appreciated

James Pritchard
