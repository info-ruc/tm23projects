Can anyone tell me more of these couriers or messengers? Where is the oldest
type of courier or messenger from and what were there names?  I found this
little bit of info:

In the days before computers ....
  .... before telephones, radio and TV.
The communication needs of the Inca empire were served by a network of relay
runners, known as "chasquis".
Trained from childhood for speed and endurance, chasquis would relay the
messages of the empire for hundreds of miles. The system was so swift and
efficient that fresh fish from the pacific could be served three hundred
miles away in the high Andes.
Found at www.chasquis.com

Isn't this the reason we travel by bicycle for such long distances? Are we
not trained to carry the information and products that others can use. One
day we will be connected from one city to the other.  The new bicycle
messenger! We will connect!
Thanks
