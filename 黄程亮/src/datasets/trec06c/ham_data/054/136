  Look at the device name in TimeDX, I'll bet it's not "Keyboard".  You
need "id chineseforkeyboard".  Same thing goes for other language versions
of win32.

  Hmmm, sounds like some new and wonderful RTF thing that I don't know
about.  Send me (not the list) the file as an attachment along with the
font it uses and I'll see what I can do.  Include a description of what the
display should look like.
