Want to keep in touch with old friends from school?
The Gradfinder website is the perfect place to do just that.

On Gradfinder you can search for friends, add your
current contact info, a current photo, and details
about what you are up to these days. You can update
your info at any time after that. All changes happen
immediately. There are also message boards you can use
to help organize reunions. You can use our photo album
wizard to create online albums to share with friends
and family.

There are currently over 100,000 schools listed from
grade 1 to university from 60 countries around the world.

This service is free so check it out!
