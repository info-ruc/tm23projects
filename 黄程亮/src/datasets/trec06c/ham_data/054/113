I highly recommend TextPad (www.textpad.com).  I use it for writing all my C, Java and HTML code.  It allows you complete control over formatting (auto-indent, tabs to spaces, etc.) and a multitude of useful tools, including parenthesis matching, regular expression search & replace, compiler & command output capture, and syntax coloring.  You can download the evaluation version for free.  It's one of the best works of software I've ever used.  (BTW, I am in no way affiliated with TextPad -- just a loyal customer)
