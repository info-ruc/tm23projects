I NEED TO KNOW THE EXACT STEPS TO CONNECT A NEW MOTOR POWER SUPPLY TO
THE HANDYBOARD WHILE IS HAS THE EXTENSION BOARD CONNECTED TO IT.

IT'S TO MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE EXTENSION BOARD SHARES THE SAME SLOT
AS THE NEW MOTOR POWER SUPPLY, IS THE ANY DOCUMENTATION UNDER THE
HANDYBOARD HOMEPAGE THAT WITH DESCRIBE HOW TO DO THIS

THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO FRED MARTIN, SINCE THE EXTENSION
BOARD AND NEW MOTOR POWER SUPPLY ARE COMMON ADJUSTMENTS WE ALL ARE FACED
WITH. MAYBE SOME OFFICIAL DUCUMENTATION SHOULD BE PRINTED UP

THANKS A LOT

BEST REGARDS,

PAUL DACOSTA,
