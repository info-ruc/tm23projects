Hi everybody

I have an application where I need to read 4 encoders,
I am looking for an accurate encoder reading IO board
which can be connected to an IBM PC. I am also looking
for the rotary encoders for that.

Please if you can help me find the IO board and the
encoders which are compatible to board I will very
appreciate it.

Mechlih
PS: please reply to my email, I am not in the
handyboard list.
