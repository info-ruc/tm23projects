Subject: Compiler Errors keep my board from loading

Help!!  I don't know how to fix compiler errors!  Specifically, I received the
following error:

"Compiler error!  47 extra bytes left on board stack.  "


and I don't know how to fix it.

I do know that I cannot load programs on my board until I fix the error.  I
posted this message before, but no one responded.

Do I have to re-downlaod the software, or is there another way?

Thank you,

Shana Negin
