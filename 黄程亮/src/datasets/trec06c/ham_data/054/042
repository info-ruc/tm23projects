What about this idea? Cut the motor trace as per on Fred's website....than
desolder the motor power header (the one that plug into the Handy board) on
the expansion board and flip the header upward and resolder it to the
expansion board. Then reuse this header by jumping the 9.6V from the Handy
Board and plug it into this header, this way, you still get the proper
voltage for the servo output on the expansion board. For the new motor
supply, just plug it into the Handy Board's orignal motor power header and
there ya go. Works great for me and my board still look as good as ever!
