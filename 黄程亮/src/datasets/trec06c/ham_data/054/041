That is the same thing, except much easier.  Plus we save donut money.  However,
we'd have to look at the effect of 7 volts reverse bias on the motor LED's.
Plus, we'd have to make real sure not to short the bent pin 8 to the socket
underneath it.  That would put 12 vlots on our 5 volt line with interesting
results.
