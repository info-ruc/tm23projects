I saw a contributed design a while back (on the HB web site, I think) of a multiplexer for running multiple Polaroid transducers off of one Polaroid ranging module.  It involved the use of a few transistors and such.  The idea was to use extra digital outputs to alternate between the two transducers.  Other than that, the hookup between the HB and the ranging module was the same as shown on the HB web site for a single unit.  It looked like the best solution, and I intend to build it just as soon as I can.  Best of luck!
