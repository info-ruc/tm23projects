Jonathan, thanks for the reply.  What I had (see below) was a typo --
it should have been <1024 768 768 16 0>, with which I get the error
mentioned below.  If I try to run an item file with <vm 800, 600, 600,
8, 0>  (or any other vm) then I do get an error message saying "video
mode not in the registry."  With my vm set at <1024 768 768 16 0>,
though (both in the item file and in the registry), all I get is the
error below.

Please don't tell me this is the video card!  It's brand new and based
on the nVIDIA RIVA TNT2  chipset (AGP, 32 megs)
