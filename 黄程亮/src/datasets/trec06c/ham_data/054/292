Hi Paul,

I think it would take out the chip, but I am currently doing this by
installing a oversize heatsink & fan to the controller chip and pulsing the
motor instead of constant current.  Exceeding the max current capacity but,
limiting duration and increasing heat dissipation works.  Sometimes. :o)
