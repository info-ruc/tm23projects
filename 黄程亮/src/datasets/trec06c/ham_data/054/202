  You're missing a number there, the bit depth of the display as in <1024
768 768 8 0> for an 8bpp display, it's probably trying to create a 32bpp
dispaly which probably needs more mempory than your display card has.  I'm
surprised DMDX didn't complain about trying to use a video mode not in the
registry.
