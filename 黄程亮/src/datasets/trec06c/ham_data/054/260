Subject: reading sensor input?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I've got a strange problem that probably has an easy solution, but I've
been trying to hard to figure it out and am afraid that now I'm missing
the obvious.

I brushed the dust off my Handy Board to build a robot for my middles
school robotics program. Batteries take and hold a charge, downloads are
ok, motors seem fine with PWM or without, but I can't seem to read
inputs.

Symptoms:

I connected photoresistors (Ratshack type) to analog inputs 0-4 (as per
the manual) and tried to read them photovore fashion, only when the bot
was turned on, nothing changed. Checked the program, it was fine. Then I
disconnected the sensors, rebooted and tried to read the ports, all read
255, digital read 0. So I reconnected the sensors and covered them, all
read 255, covered or not. so I tried to read the frob_knob() and it came
back 255, regardless of its position, it's 255.

Then (wierd part), after the borad was off for a while, I turned in on
with a photoresistor attached to digital(8), just to see if I could make
it go high. Of course, it stayed low, but I checked analog(1) and it
read 0! quick, hookup the photoresistor and read it in full light, 255!
Cover it, read it...255. What? Then, after that, all analog inputs read
255, and frob_knob still stays at 255.

Problem?

I'm worried that I screwed up the photoresistor hookup. Note the ASCII
art representation of the input layout below:


HC11 chip

|---|---|	INPUTS
|   |   |	<-- top row
|---|---|
    		<-- space
|---|---|
|   |   |	<-- middle row
|---|---|
|   |   |	<-- bottom row
|---|---|

Front of Board

Pretend that this is analogs 0 and 1. This position would put the IR
input directly to the right, and the rest off the page. My original
scheme had one leg of the light sensor in the bottom row (gnd?) and one
in the top row (input?). I tried it this way to back sure it didn't work
and was confirmed. then I attached a +5v (from board) to the middle row
and tried it. nothing happened. This *is* the correct scheme, is it not?

Jonathan... praying I didn't fry that by shorting the middle row.
