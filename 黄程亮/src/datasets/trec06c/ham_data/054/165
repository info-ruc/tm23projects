I learned that somebody has successfully connected GARMIN GPS to HB.  If =
I am not wrong , this GPS is not be able to receive any signal in =
building.  If this the case, GPS is only good for outdoor robotics.  =
Another thing is about the accuracy of the GPS, it is about 1 to 15 feet =
which I think is not good for detail mapping.

Please comment.

Regards,
William
