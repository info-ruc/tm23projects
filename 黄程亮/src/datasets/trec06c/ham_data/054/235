One kiss nah done lips. <BR><BR>If yuh finger get sore, nah tek am and throw way.Haste makes waste  Fate leads the willing but drives the stubborn In the coldest flint there is hot fire Never judge a book by its cover. Unkissed, unkindA hedge between keeps friendship green. There is a skeleton in every cupboard  God gives every bird its food, but does not always drop it into the nest  Laugh and the world laughs with you, cry and you cry alone 
A soft answer turneth away wrath.Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow Be a good sport - wherever you go  <BR>If you want a place in the sun, you must leave the shade of the family tree When man mek heself sugar he mattie ah suck am. Yuh can't suck cane and blow whistle.If you're too open-minded, your brains will fall out. . If Wishes Were Horses, Beggars Would Ride Opportunity seldom knocks twice. When in Rome, do as the Romans do Every man has his price<BR>All sunshine makes a desert  
Cold hands, warm heart  My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother.
