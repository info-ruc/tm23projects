Tried what you said Joshua, I went through all the analog ports and manually 
fed them with a TTL signal from a function generator at a relatively low 
frequency of 5Hz and wrote this little test code to test it. In this example, 
the sencdr3.icb has been loaded with a global variable named encoder3_counts. 
This variable kept the running count of the encoder's ticks so I really dont 
have to do anything else but to read it. 

void encoder_test()
    {
        while(1)
                {
                        printf("Count: %d\n", encoder3_counts);
                }
    }

void main()
{
start_process(encoder_test());
}

The optical encoder is connected to analog port 3 with a 330 ohms current 
limiting resistor for the Emmiter and the sensor si pull up by the Handy 
Board's internal 47K. An oscilloscope is connected to the sensor side of the 
encoder (QRB1114) . I ran the code and got the pulse but I have no result on 
the LCD beside a 1 which seems to "stuck" there and wont change. Does anybody 
else have this problem with using this driver? Thanks.

Best regard,
Rob
