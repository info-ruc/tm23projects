  No, 32 megs is more than enough for any video mode.  I have a TNT2 in the
development machine which I can test when I get to work, but I doubt that
it will fail.  When do you get the error message?  Immediately as the item
file runs or only at a specific item?  If it's only at a specific item you
might check the positioning of elements in the item and make sure that they
don't extend beyond the edges of the screen as this can often cause the
kind of error you are experiencing.
