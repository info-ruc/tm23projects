Hi
	When I try to start a process , the code downloads fine , it runs on the 
board with no errors but it only excutes the first proceess once  and none 
of the others.

void main()
{
	start_process(fwrd());
	start_process(checkir());
	start_process(checkbumpers());
}

fwrd is just fd(1) fd(2) check IR  is one checking    digital(4) an turning 
the bot 80 degrees amd check bumpers checks a bumper array and moves the bot 
with the same function as checkir

any suggestions?

PS
	I know the code works because ive used in :

void main()
{
	fwrd();
	checkir();
	checkbumpers();
}
	I would use the above code but it taxes the processor to much for me to run 
anything else ie: low level vision , maze algotrithm

thanx
