Hi!,

I just asked this question but did not get any help.  I need help
interfacing two Polaroid 6500's to one HB w/ Expansion Board.  This is a
project for school and needs to be finished soon that's why I need
help.  I would really appreciate any help people could give me on this
subject.

Thanks,
-p
