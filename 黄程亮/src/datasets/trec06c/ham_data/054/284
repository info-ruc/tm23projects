Rob,

I use these same encoders just as you do, and they work fine.  However, the
spacing of the encoders from thier targets is important for proper function.
1.5 to 2 mm works well for me.

In addition, I have had to play with the encoder high threshold to make things
work.  I set mine at 125, and never miss a count.

Good Luck,

Gary Livick
