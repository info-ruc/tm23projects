DETAILED DESCRIPTIONS OF TUTORIALS:

T2 (Models in IR): MODELS IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL, INCLUDING CROSS LANGUAGE
                  RETRIEVAL by Fredric C. Gey, University of California

   COURSE DESCRIPTION:
   Information retrieval algorithms have emerged as the key to effective search
   of large collections of unstructured text such as found on the Internet.
   Vector space algorithms are used by Lycos and AltaVista, while Inktome uses
   a probabilistic document retrieval algorithms.

   The three major theoretical models in information retrieval are Boolean/logic,
   vector space, and probabilistic. This tutorial will explain the unique
   characteristics and problems of each model and how each model has evolved
   along different lines. Modern variants of the basic models are explained.

   A major application area of IR is in cross-language retrieval, which combines
   linguistic techniques with traditional mono-lingual retrieval techniques. This
   is a burgeoning research area and deserves special devoted attention to the
   techniques of machine translation, bilingual dictionaries, and corpora-based
   learning. I will also discuss the special challenges of Asian language
   retrieval (Japanese, Chinese, Indian subcontinent languages).

   The attendees of this tutorial will obtain a basic understanding of the major
   theoretical models upon which modern text retrieval software is based. The
   tutorial should provide each participant with a starting point for further
   elf-education.

   Materials: 110 Course overheads provided
     
   WHO SHOULD ATTEND:  This course is designed to provide a fast-paced
   yet rigorous introduction to  the basic models of Information Retrieval
   for academic and industrial research and development computer scientists
   whose background lies outside the Information Retrieval area.

T3 (Info System): Spatio-Temporal Information Systems: A Conceptual
                  Perspective by Christine PARENT, Stefano SPACCAPIETRA,
                                 and Esteban ZIMANYI

   COURSE DESCRIPTION:
   Despite the well-established benefits of conceptual modeling for application
   design, current spatio-temporal models do not cope satisfactorily with
   designers' requirements. In this tutorial we first identify the goals of a
   spatio-temporal conceptual model and then we describe the MADS model along
   the structural, spatial, and temporal dimensions. As the modeling concepts
   are orthogonal, the proposed model achieves both simplicity (as concepts
   are independent from each other) and expressive power (as concepts may be
   freely associated). The model has been implemented and can be translated to
   operational models of existing products. The tutorial briefly describes the
   architecture we defined for providing users with a set of conceptual
   interfaces for defining and accessing spatio-temporal information systems.

   Finally, the tutorial reports on results of an experimentation which allowed
   us to assess the qualities of the model.

   KEYWORDS: information systems, conceptual modeling, data models, spatial
   databases, temporal databases, database design, GIS, geographic information
   systems, CASE tools, practical experiments.

   OUTLINE OF THE TUTORIAL:

   1 Introduction
   1.1 State of the Art
   Review of different spatial and temporal database models showing that they
   do not answer satisfactorily to users' requirement.
   1.2 The MADS Conceptual Model
   General objectives pursued in the development of the MADS (Modeling of
   application Data with Spatio-temporal features) model.
   2 Modeling Classical Data
   Structural features of the MADS model: object types, relationship types,
   attributes, generalization links, aggregation links, and associated
   integrity constraints.
   3 Modeling Spatial Characteristics
   3.1 Description of Spatiality
   Description of the spatial abstract types supported by the MADS model.
   Generalization hierarchy of these abstract types.
   3.2 Spatial Attributes and Object Types
   Associating spatiality to information as well as the corresponding
   constraints.
   3.3 Interior and Envelope of Spatial Objects
   Definition of the concepts of envelope, interior, and topological
   relationships for general composite objects.
   3.4 Spatial Relationship Types
   Explicitly describing spatial relationships in conceptual schemas.
   Two categories of spatial relationships: topological relationships and
   spatial aggregation.
   3.5 Space-varying Attributes
   Describing continuous fields using a first-class concept: reconciliating
   the discrete (vector) view and the continuous (raster) view.
   3.6 Generalization and Spatiality
   Semantics of generalization when it relates spatial and non-spatial object
   types. Inheritance mechanisms when the spatiality of the supertype is
   referred in the subtype: redefinition and refinement.
   4 Modeling Temporal Characteristics
   4.1 Temporal Attributes
   Assigning temporality to attributes, both simple and complex: semantics
   and associated integrity constraints.
   4.2 Temporal Object Types
   Assigning temporality to objects: life cycle of objets. Temporal objects
   having temporal attributes.
   4.3 Generalization and Temporality
   Semantics of generalization when it relates temporal and non-temporal
   object types. Inheritance mechanisms when the temporality of the supertype
   is referred in the subtype: redefinition and refinement.
   4.4 Temporal Relationship Types

   relationships relating non-temporal/temporal objects.
   4.5 Modeling Temporal Dynamics
   Describing inter-object dynamics where time plays an essential role.

   of water resources of the Vaud county in Switzerland.
   6 Conclusions and Perspectives

T4 (Data Mining/Large DB): Recent Advances in Data Mining Algorithms on Large
                       Databases by Rajeev Rastogi and Kyuseok Shim, Bell Lab
   Level : Intermediate.
   Intended Audience : Professionals who would like to get introduced to/know
   about the state of the art data mining techniques and products for large
   databases.

   COURSE DESCRIPTION:
   A large number of corporations have invested heavily in information
   technology to manage their businesses more effectively, and vast amounts
   of critical business data have been stored in database systems. The volume
   of this data is expected to grow considerably in the near future. Yet many
   organizations have been unable to collect valuable insights from the data
   to guide their marketing strategy, investment and management policies.  One
   of the reasons for this is that most information is stored implicitly in
   the large amounts of data. Fortunately, new and sophisticated techniques
   being developed in the area of data mining can help companies leverage their
   data more effectively and extract insightful information from their data.

   This tutorial describes the fundamental algorithms for data mining, many
   of  which have been proposed in recent years. These techniques include
   association rules, correlation, causal relationship, clustering, outlier
   detection, similar time sequences, similar images, sequential patterns and
   classification. In addition, since we will cover technical material in some
   degree of depth, the audience will get a good exposure to the results in the
   area, and also future research directions.

   Tutorial Outline: The following topics will be discussed during the
   tutorial.

   1. Introduction :
   Brief overview and discussion on data mining techniques developed for large
   databases.
   2. Association Rules and Sequential Patterns:
   Presents association rules, optimized association rules, sequential
   patterns,
   correlations, and causal relationships. Also covers the idea of pushing
   constraints on these algorithms.
   3. Bayesian Network
   Introduce the concept of Bayesian networks and their role in mining causal
   relationships.
   4. Classification :
   Describes the state of the art classifiers for large databases. These
