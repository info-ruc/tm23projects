Thats great Gary,
        This was the same conclusion that I'd come to myself, however I've
now run into another problem with the otherwise brilliant 'D12 sensor. I'm
currently using the Digitalker speech system from Jameco, and when the 'D12
is plugged in (I.e transmitting) it causes a lot of noise on the speaker,
and on any other speaker in the vicinity for that matter. Is there anything
to be done, shielding the 'D12 somehow? Any ideas? Thanks,
        Matt
