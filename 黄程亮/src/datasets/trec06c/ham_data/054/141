I'm still fiddling around trying to get the VOX recording system to work. I
have installed DirectX 7, and DMDX 1.1.12. When I press the VOX button on
the DMDX main console, with no tasks running in the background, I get the
following message:

DirectSoundCaptureCreate failed
DSERR_ALLOCATED (8878000a)
The call failed because resources (such as a priority level) were already
being used by another caller.

Can anybody interpret this for me? Even better, has anyone had this problem
themselves, and does anyone know how to fix it?
