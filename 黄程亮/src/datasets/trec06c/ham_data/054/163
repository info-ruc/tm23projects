If you haven't already done so, pick up a copy of the motorola chip guides
(not sure which version of chip is used in the Handyboard 'A9 version? or
E2?  Either way, these "Pink books" are absolutely essential to learning
the addressing of the 68HC11.  Try motorola's website for more info.  I
don't have the URL handy, sorry.
 
I'm sure there is probably a Handyboard users manual somewhere too that
will give you more details on what controls what.  Check out the
Handyboard site for more details.
 
Good luck,
