From what I could figure out from the literature on the HB, the motor
controller circuit is controlled by Port B on the 6811.  With a little
tinkerin last nite I was trying to set/reset some of the pins poking values
into $1004 (Got this from "An Introduction to the 6811" by Fred.  I assumed
that the miniboard used the same port for motor control that the HB does). 
It didn't seem to work.  No changes at the l293 inputs.  So......  I got to
wonderin.....  Are the PWM routines overriding my changes.  If so, is there
a way to disable the PWM so that I could use those outputs.  

For what I'm trying to do, I don't use the motor controllers and I don't
want to give up any of the other input capability.

Thanks
