Hi Paul,

I don't know how the handyboard is protected against overload but one
thing is for sure : if you overload the driver chip ... this one will
fry up.In worst case you'll fry the board as well.

If a driver chip's maximum current is 1 Amp. then don't go over this limit!
Also, if possible,place a heathsink on the driver chip surface, this will
keep the chip 'cooler' and protect it better against thermal breakdown.

Uncooled is the output current much lower than cooled.
For more details (if possible) check the data sheets from the driver chip.
