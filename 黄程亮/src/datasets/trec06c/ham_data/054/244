Hi all!

As I plan to build a Handy Bord, and as I am a bit far away from USA, I just
would like to know if there is anyone living in France (and maybe in/near
Paris?)...

Electronic components aren't really cheap here, so if I could share tips about
Robotic and electronic, that would be really nice!
