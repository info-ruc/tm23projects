Subject: Compile Error: extra bytes in stack.

I got this error: 

	Compiler error!  47 extra bytes left on board stack  

and I  read in the technical manuel that all compiler errors
must be fixed before I can download a file to the 
board. How do I fix this error? 

I have consulted previous postings on this topic, but no one ever seems to
explain how to fix the compile error.  Am I missing something obvious? 

Thanks.
