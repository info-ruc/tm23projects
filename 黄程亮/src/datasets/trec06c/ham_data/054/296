It won't necessarily fry the chip.

L293s (and the TI equivalent) have a thermal protection mode.  If the chip gets
too hot, it will turn itself off.  Most of the time, this protects the chip
against over-current.

However, it is still possible to fry the chip with a current spike that will do
it in before the overheat protection can kick in.
