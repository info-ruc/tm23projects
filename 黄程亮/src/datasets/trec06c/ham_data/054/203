     Adam:
     
     The pink book part number from Motorola is: M68HC11RM/AD this is 
     the general reference manual for the whole family of 
     microcontrollers, there is also a technical data manual with P/N: 
     MC68HC11A8/D this one just covers the A series processors.

Hi,
I've seen this referenced, and grabbed the link that someone provided the 
other day. I've had a look at all the different manuals listed, but I can' 
work out which is the right one to grab. My handyboard has the 68HC11A1FN 
part number.
     
Can anyone help?
thanks
Adam
