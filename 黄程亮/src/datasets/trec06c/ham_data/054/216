  1024x768x16 on my TNT2 works so I dunno what the surface too big error is
relating to unless it's some syntactically correct frame that has some
semantic error in it, usually a bitmap but it could be text that is
positioned such that it overlaps the edge of the screen.  If it's not that
you might want to go to the NVIDIA web site (www.nvidia.com) and grab their
reference drivers, I'm was using the 2.08 Detonator drivers and they work,
3.53 was just released last night and I'd install them and try it except
that every man and his dog that owns a TNT is downloading them right now --
in any event I'd be _way_ surprised if they failed, I never use anyhting
except NVIDIA reference drivers.
