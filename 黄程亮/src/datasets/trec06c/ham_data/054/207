Hi,

I am having great difficulty trying to get my shaft encoder to work using  
both sencdr3.icb or fencdr3.icb driver. I am using the QRB1114 optical sensor 
connected to analog port 3 with a current limiting resistor of 330 ohms for 
the emmiter and the default 47k pull-up resistor from the Handy board. I've 
even tried using a smaller valued limiting resistor of 220 ohms and its still 
didn't work ! I' ve loaded the sencdr3.icb into the handy board and  wrote 
this little simple test code to see if my encoder work and so far I have no 
result, all I got was a 1. I'd appreciated if some one can help me out on 
this one, Thanks in advance.

int encoder_test() 
           {      
            while(1)
                    {
                        int count;
                            count = encoder3_counts;
                        printf("Count: %d," count);
                    }
            return count;
           }

void main()
    {
        while(1)
            {
                encoder_test();
            }
     }
