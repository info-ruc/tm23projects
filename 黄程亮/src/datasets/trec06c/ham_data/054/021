HiHi,
    I am a final year student in HongKong, I'm now trying to build a 6-legged
robot, with 2 servos per leg. I would like to use the Handyboard interfacing
with 2 Mini SSC-II servo controller, but since I am a new player in robotics,
I do not know how to do this. In addition, my programming skill is not good
enough, can anyone give me a piece of advise, and the codes if possible.

Thanks for help.
                                Frankie Lai
