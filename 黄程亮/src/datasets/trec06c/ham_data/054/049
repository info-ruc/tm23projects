My suggestion is to double check that you double check the simple things
withing the code (your code should be executing an infinite loop)

while(1)
 {
  code ....
 }

If the code is more complex and involves external assembly modules, check that
they aren't damaging the multitasker (writing to unknown memory adresses etc.)
Then check that the start process is allocating enough space on the stack and
time cycles. If it still fails try to reload your pcode and library files, and
make sure that no problems are occuring because of data corruption.

  good luck!
