Subject: Interfacing 2 Ultrasonic Modules onto one HB?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I am trying to interface two Polaroid 6500 ultrasonic ranging modules
onto one HB to simplify my project.  I know this has been done and it is
probably very easy but I am not an electrical engineering expert and
cannot figure it out.  I have two polaroid 6500's, one HB, and an
expansion board coming.  With these supplies how would I be able to do
this?

I appreciate and help in this matter.
