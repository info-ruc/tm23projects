Great solution Gary!  How about just pulling the L293D/SN754410 from
the U11 socket, bending pin-8 out and soldering the REALLY BIG battery
positive lead to it, then soldering the negative lead to pin-1 without
bending it out, and then reinstalling the chip.  It doesn't save much
money since there wasn't much money involved, but it does save quite
a bit of time.  Biggest benefit is that if you use the HB on more
than one project, all that needs to be done to switch back and forth
is to have an extra chip on hand ... swap the modified chip for the
unmodified one.

Your method provides and very easy way to change the driver chip to
a much higher power chip such as the 298L.
