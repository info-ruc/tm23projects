Hi All,

Penn State Abington will host the second annual Robo-TrailBlazers
autonomous robot contest on Sat Dec 4, 1999 at 3pm.  The contest is open to
all students (and even a few non-student types) as participants.  (The
contest is HandyBoard and LegoMindstorms friendly.)  The contest is open to
the public as spectators. It's free! 

Penn State Abington is located near Philadelphia, PA USA

Robots can interact with an electric train, cross railroad tracks, pick up
cans, etc.  Robot teams are encouraged.

Of course you have enough time to build a robot!
