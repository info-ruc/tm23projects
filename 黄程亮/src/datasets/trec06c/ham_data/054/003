  Later today I'll probably be releasing DMDX 1.1.12.  It contains an
interesting fix for another MS Word weirdness where someone had
accidentally turned on the page numbering.  What this produced was a error
message from DMDX complaining that there was an item number missing and the
item it displayed was the parameter line, whereas in Word of course the
first line was in fact the parameter line, hmmm.  I've managed to make DMDX
1.1.12 ignore that particular stuff from Word, however FYI, if you have
trouble with DMDX like this again where it's complaining about something
that makes no sense whatsoever you can look at two files that DMDX
produces, rtfparsed.itm and scrambled.itm.  These are the text (not RTF)
files produced as DMDX gets around to running your item and syntax errors
reported by DMDX are actually in these files (unless it's an RTF control
word DMDX doesn't know, then it's in the actual RTF item file).  So when I
looked at rtfparsed.itm I could see that instead of the file beginning with
the parameter line it started with PAGE  9 and a couple of blank lines and
then parameter line, so the parameter line was being interpreted as an item
and of course it didn't have an item number.

  The reason I won't release it till later today is that I am filling out
the section at the end of the input section in the DMDX help file detailing
our results w.r.t. Moyers' article.
