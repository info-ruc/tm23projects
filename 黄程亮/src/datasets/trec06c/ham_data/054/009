Hi,


That error message is actually to do with a fault in the Borland 
Delphi code for serial transfer, NOT a fault with the HandyBoard!

(I use the same Delphi code in my HandyBoard terminal program as the
program HBDL).
It appears to manily occur on faster machines.

I only have P1 computers to work with, so am not able to reproduce 
the problem.

When I get time, and access to a faster machine, I will look into the 
problem.
(At least for the HandyBoard.exe program).
