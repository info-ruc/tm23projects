Howdy gang,

Once again, I've started to rebuff starting my Messenger service again
here in Eugene. Tired with all the sleazy gripes of working for someone
else. This time, I'm determined to get this off the ground. So, what I
need from the list, if what type of fees that everyone is charging for
service.

Thanks,

Jeff
