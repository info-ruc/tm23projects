Handyboard Community,

Has anyone written code for the GP2D02 sensor without the expansion board. I have a group of High school kids that have KISS institute robot kits. This kit comes with a handyboard and LEGO's but no expansion board. Being on a limited budget we can't upgrade these systems this year.

Any help on this would be appreciated.

Greg
