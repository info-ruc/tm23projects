Dear Colleagues,



'Talk peace, prepare for war':

Thanks for all your entries to our competition in last week's email
asking you to identify the HR departments plotting to take as much cash
off you as possible (if you need a reminder of this 'who said what to
whom' email: justine.stephens@aut.org.uk ). Sadly it would appear that
HR departments across the UK are capable of making life as difficult as
possible for you, as many of you came back to us convinced it was your
institution. No one has got it right yet so we're giving you another
week! Send your answers to matt.waddup@aut.org.uk or
Justine.stephens@aut.org.uk



Win the argument, win the ballot:

The link below will take you to a document of bullet points to help
committee members, activists and department reps in making the arguments
to colleagues for voting and for voting yes in this crucial ballot.



Following feedback from members, we have tried to make the document as
simple as we can have assumed as little as possible, recognising that we
need to bring many members up to speed on this dispute as quickly as
possible.



The document makes the case for our pay campaign based on the historic
decline in salaries, shows how VCs have lied to us, gives a brief
history of this dispute and urges the importance of voting and voting
yes. http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/1/c/paycampaigninbrief.pdf



Correcting the employers' wrongs:

It was great to see a couple of letters in the THES this week taking the
employers to task. If you see something in the THES that you think needs
addressing you can always email a letter for publication to
letterspage@thes.co.uk. Keep it short and succinct (200 words maximum),
make sure you mark it as a letter for publication and enclose full
contact details. You can read the letters, more details of the UUK and
UCEA fall out over who promised Alan Johnson what, and a round up of
what's been happening in the press in this week's media digest at:
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=1510



Ticking the boxes:

There are now only two weeks to go before the ballot closes and we have
that long to build the kind of turnout and a majority for action that
will shake the employers from their complacency. PLEASE email your
colleagues to ensure that they vote and urge them to vote YES to action
and YES to action short of a strike.



Remember this? A survey conducted by the Employment Relations Research
Centre at the University of Copenhagen, showed that 30% of people who do
not vote in ballots fail to do so because they forget. Every voter who
fails to cast their vote detracts from the legitimacy of our ballot and
represents, in effect, a vote for the employer. Don't forget to use your
vote and remind your colleagues!



In brief:

*	Sincere apologies to the hundreds of you who have joined in last
two weeks, demand is heavy but we are working as fast as we can to get
ballot papers out to you all. If you have been a member for a while and
have not received your ballot paper or have lost it, please contact:
membership@aut.org.uk *	Reports from general meetings around the country have been
flooding in - the mood is good! Keep them coming! *	We have received a large number of complaints from members about
VCs sending out emails and letters to all staff trying to tell them how
to vote - and there were we thinking it was a secret ballot! If,
following communication from your VC, you have become concerned about
industrial action, please see advice here:
