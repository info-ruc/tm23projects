I could be wrong, but here is my theory on the ink.
   
  I was reminded of something I saw on PBS about a black man collecting racist paraphernalia and memorabilia for a museum, to show the history of racism. On item was an ad ad for ink, with a young black child nursing from it; I won't quote the offensive ad, but I found a picture of it online (http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/collect/milk.jpg) (I found it on the man I saw on PBS's website (ignore the grammar of that sentence) which can be found here:http://www.ferris.edu/jimcrow/collect/) 
   
  Which all the symbolism of milk, infants, nursing, and motherhood, along with blackness and skin color, this image become especially interesting.
   
  Perhaps in the context of Beloved, the  ink is representative of how Sethe's race is looked on a disgusting and a grounds to treat her as an animal for the whites, like schoolteacher, until she is able to reproduce that blackness into something useful--i.e., ink, or her slave children which she "breeds" as a piece of livestock.
   
  Or maybe I'm just over-thinking it. Anyway, the Jim Crow museum thing seems relevant, and I was proud of myself for making the connection...*humor intended there*

As I read the first part of Beloved, there was one thing 
that many people said was significant, but I still don't 
understand it—what is the significance of ink? When Sethe 
is obsessed that the schoolteacher used the ink that she 
made, is he talking about her milk or actual ink that the 
slaves had to make? I realize that many people may think 
this is stupid, but I don't get it. I can understand 
Sethe's horror at having her milk stolen, but what is so 
important about the ink? Also, as I was reading, I 
wondered if Halle was ever going to show up again in the 
present, instead of simply in all the memories Sethe and 
Paul D. have. One other thing I was wondering, was why 
did Paul D. show up just to leave again? Was it to simply 
move the plot along so we could find out about when Sethe 
tried to kill her children in all the flashbacks, but that 
could have been accomplished in a different way, so why is 
Paul D. there?
