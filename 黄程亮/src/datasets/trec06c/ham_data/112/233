Hello,

My name is AMOS JACK a British citizen the acting Treasury Director / Vault
Keeper of the Central Bank of Iraq.

As every one knows, Iraq is on the verge of a civil war,and after the pain and
the suffering of the last two wars,I want to leave before the war starts In
order to guarantee a better life for myself and my family, I have decided to
move millions of Dollars to safety abroad, for my private
investment.

As the Treasury Director and Vault Keeper, I am in charge of over US$90 million
cash stored in our vaults which have very little or no documentation. These
monies were usually brought in cash and stored in safe deposit boxes owned by
top members of former President Saddam Husseins Government.

These deposits were not put in regular accounts because they were money used to
purchase weapons and to fund the lavish lifestyles of President Saddam Hussein
and his henchmen.

Expectedly, some of the owners of these Safe deposit boxes in the Iraq Central
Bank are dead; Some simply abandoned the boxes for fear of prosecution by the
new Government of Iraq led by government of American and Britian I have devised
a way to move some of the money out to a willing helper that is 100% risk free.

Can you act as a RECEIVER? If you are willing to be my Partner, please reply
immediately, and I will give you details of how the money will be moved abroad
to safety,WITHOUT USING BANK ACCOUNTS! This is because wire transfers can be
traced! In order to eliminate all traces, the money must be physically
transported to your designated address.

In my next mail, I will tell you how we can do this without any risk! If you
agree to be my Partner, you will keep 25%of any amount that I am able to move
out.

For security reasons, please contact me only via email, for now at least.

Regards,

AMOS JACK,
