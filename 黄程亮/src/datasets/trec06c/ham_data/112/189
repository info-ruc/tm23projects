Taylor,

 I just had this discussion with Mrs. Hammond.  There
could be several reasons Beloved forces herself upon
Paul D.  The foremost one is that it is a way for her
to try to distance him from Sethe.  She is a child who
is willing to go to any ends in order to preserve her
mother for herself.  As we saw, she kept moving him
farther away from his original bedroom and eventually
out into the cold house where the sexual relations
take place. 

He feels so much shame over his actions with Beloved
that his "tin" became a "red heart" b/c he felt an
emotion--shame--for the first time in a long time. 
That is why  he feels compelled to see Sethe and
confess to her but instead he asks for a baby.  He
eventually puts  his shame on her b/c he can't handle
his emotions nor the shame he feels about Sethe's
desperate act; instead of handling it, he calls her an
animal.  

That's just one of a couple theories.  you'll have to
ask Mrs. Hammond about the one involving a siren-type
creature that is found in folklore.
