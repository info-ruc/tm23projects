OECD's Centre for Educational Research and Innovation is carrying out a 
study on Open Educational Resources (OER) in higher education. As one part 
of that study we are launching a web based survey for individual teachers, 
instructors and researchers using or producing OER.

We would like to invite anyone working in a higher educational institution 
that uses or produces open learning content, such as courses, courseware, 
content modules, learning objects, collections and journals, or open 
software tools to develop, use, re-use and deliver learning content, to 
take our survey. It will not take more than 10-15 minutes to complete.

This is the link to the survey: 
<http://www2.oecd.org/survey/Surveys/TakeSurvey.aspx?surveyid=1075>http://www2.oecd.org/survey/Surveys/TakeSurvey.aspx?surveyid=1075

Anybody completing the questionnaire will receive a free electronic copy of 
the final report.
