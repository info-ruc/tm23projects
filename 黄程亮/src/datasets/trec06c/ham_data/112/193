  I never really thought of it that way, but that seems to be a logical reason for Sethe keeping Beloved around.  At the funeral no one would eat Sethe’s food and Sethe forbid Denver from eating anyone else’s food, and Sethe said that she used to be too prideful to ask for a ride home from work and would refuse rides from anyone that offered.  This makes it seem as if Sethe dislikes the rest of the community and therefore it seems odd that she would let someone she didn’t know stay for so long.  Sethe does seem to have trouble talking about the past to Denver though, which frustrates Denver even more, and Beloved seems to have a way of connecting the two, of getting Sethe to answer the questions with Denver listening to the stories.  Sethe seems very hesitant to move on, but since Beloved has come and Sethe knows (thinks?) that she is her child it brings her comfort knowing that her child has returned to her without malicious intentions, and knowing she feels as if she can move on
 and forget the past.  She can “forget it all now,” knowing that if Beloved was mad at her, “you ain’t now because you came back here to me” (184).  If Beloved is the murdered child and Sethe could have subconsciously noticed when Beloved arrived (when it seemed like her water broke again, etc.) then it would make sense as to why Sethe let Beloved stay when she seemed to dislike the rest of the community as she did.
