Seismology at Assistant Professor level.  We seek a candidate who =20
uses seismological data to investigate the physics of earthquake =20
processes.  The successful candidate will be expected to develop a =20
research program complimentary to our strengths in theoretical/=20
numerical modeling of earthquakes and earthquake processes, =20
experimental and theoretical investigations of rheological properties =20=

as they pertain to shallow and deep earthquakes, and electromagnetic =20
field research on faults and crustal structure.  Our current faculty =20
in these areas is James Dieterich, Harry Green, David Oglesby, =20
Stephen Park, and Guanshui Xu.  We are a core member in the Southern =20
California Earthquake Center and active in the Institute of =20
