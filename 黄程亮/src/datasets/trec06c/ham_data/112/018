ATTENTION. 100%.RISK FREE
          (RE: TRANSFER OF US$168.559 MILLION 
TO YOUR ACCOUNT.)
My name is MR MODISE MOATHLODI. I work as AUDITOR 
GENERAL IN  First National Bank South Africa.
on my routine  inspection 
I discovered  a  dormant  domiciliary  account 
with  a  Balance of 
(One hundred and sixty eight million five hundred and fifty nine 
thousand U.S dollars only}. 
The owner of the fund was a foreigner, a 
program leader  who was believed to acquire the fund through his secret
Crude Oil deal with the Former IRAQI government.
 
 It is only a 
foreigner who can claim this money with legal claims to the account 
holder which I will provide
to you if you are interested.
At the 
conclussion of this transaction, your share will be 15% of the total 
transfer sum, 80% for me and my 
partner while 5% will be set aside for 
any expenses both parties might incure during the process of the 
transfer.
 The fund will be transferred to your account in two parts. I 
will first transfer USD 38 Million to your account
as a test transfer. 
I will fly over to meet you after the successful transfer for sharing 
according to the agreed percentages. 
Let me know if you can handle 
it. 
Best Regards, 
MR MODISE MOATHLODI.
