This article gives a good description of how on chip wires can actually 
force transistor spacing to increase (and hence density to decrease) at 
smaller etch sizes.  The article also gives some nice info on the issues 
of adding layers to a chip and explores one solution to this problem - 
3d chip stacking with transistor clustering around the vias...

And if you enjoy seeing progress in 3d fabrication technology, 
Semiconductor weekly recently devoted an entire issue to the topic:
