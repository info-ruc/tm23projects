   Yeah, very similar to a situation I saw here a year or two ago on one 
machine that was tied to BMP files as well.  It's possible I ditched the 
video card in the machine that had the problems, alas I can't recall.  I 
seem to recall being disappointed as it was a video card I had particular 
trust in (a TNT2 if I recall correctly).  You might try 24 bit video modes 
as they tend to be in use more than any others and are thus likely to be 
more stable.  Other things to try are to change the way the bitmaps are 
made (can't recall if that was the solution here, might have been).  Try 
different color depths in the bitmaps, even if you have to go to 8 bit 
bitmaps it doesn't matter as the bitmap is up-sampled to whatever the 
display is.  I'll as the person that was doing the work if they recall what 
the problem was or what my solution was.
