Subject: [CS395T] I updated the presentation
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I updated the presentation to include the derivation of power increasing 
at the cube of frequency.  But I just wanted to emphasize that this rule 
only holds while you can keep reducing voltage to the minimum needed to 
support each given frequency.  Once you can nolonger drop voltage 
further, power only falls linearly with further frequency drops.

Also, I misjudged the size of H&P chapter 6.  It is only 150 pages, and 
only 132 of those pages are reading sections. So in reality it's quite a 
light read after all.
