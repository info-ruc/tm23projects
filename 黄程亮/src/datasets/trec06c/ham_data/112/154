Hi Jonathan et al,
         I promise to stop hassling really soon - at least for a while :-)

Just wanted to update that I have tried other video modes <VM 
1024,768,16,0> being my first choice but it does not stop the 
lockups.  I have found that removing the BMPs from the display, or at 
least placing multiple items of text between them appears to avoid 
the lockups.  It looks like repeated BMP displays may play a part in 
the lockups.  I have hacked the file so that one BMP is followed by 4 
or 5 text only items and it works fine (6 trials, 0 lockups).

I dont know if this is any points to some other issue or you can 
suggest anything else but until I try a full length version of the 
experiment it looks like I have a way to avoid the lockup.

Thanks for the help and if you have any other suggestions please make them

regards
Peter
