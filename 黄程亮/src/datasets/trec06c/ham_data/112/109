   Pretty sure "Really Bad" is -buffers 2.

   Hmm, sounds similar to another issue we saw here for a while but I'm not 
recalling what the final solution to that one was.  I'm thinking it was SP2 
problem or was a problem resolved by installing SP2.  OTOH, sometimes a 
video driver is just flat out going to have errors in it and DMDX relies on 
a feature of DirectX that almost no one else uses let alone uses in a 
fashion like DMDX does so until I got MS to make the way DMDX uses video 
drivers part of their WHQL testing a LOT of drivers failed.

   You could try it without any graphics, the problem I'm vaguely recalling 
had to do with bitmaps and screen resolutions.  Ohh, there it is, 
<VideoMode 1024,768,8,0>, you're using a 8 bit color depth.  Absolutely 
don't use 256 color mode, it's busted even in working video drivers.
