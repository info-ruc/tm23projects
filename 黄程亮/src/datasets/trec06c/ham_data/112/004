Overview

   Various Oracle products and components are affected by multiple
   vulnerabilities. The impacts of these vulnerabilities include remote
   execution of arbitrary code, information disclosure, and denial of
   service.


I. Description

   Oracle has released Critical Patch Update - January 2006. This update
   addresses more than eighty vulnerabilities in different Oracle
   products and components.

   The Critical Patch Update provides information about affected
   components, access and authorization required, and the impact of the
   vulnerabilities on data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
   For more information on terms used in the Critical Patch Update,
   Metalink customers should refer to MetaLink Note 293956.1.

   According to Oracle, three of the vulnerabilities corrected un the
   Oracle Critical Patch Update for January 2006 affect Oracle Database
   Client-only installations.

   US-CERT recommends that sites running Oracle review the Critical Patch
   Update, apply patches, and take other mitigating action as
   appropriate. US-CERT is tracking all of these issues under VU#545804.
   As further information becomes available, we will publish individual
   Vulnerability Notes.


II. Impact

   The impact of these vulnerabilities varies depending on the product,
   component, and configuration of the system. Potential consequences
   include the execution of arbitrary code or commands, information
   disclosure, and denial of service. Vulnerable components are likely to
   be available to attackers via remote networks and with limited or no
   prior authorization. An attacker who compromises an Oracle database
   may be able to gain access to sensitive information.


III. Solution

Apply a patch

   Apply the appropriate patches or upgrade as specified in the Oracle
   Critical Patch Update - January 2006. Note that this Critical Patch
   Update only lists newly corrected issues. Updates to patches for
   previously known issues are not listed.

   As noted in the update, some patches are cumulative, others are not:

     The Oracle Database, Oracle Application Server, Oracle Enterprise
     Manager Grid Control, Oracle Collaboration Suite, JD Edwards
     EnterpriseOne and OneWorld Tools, and PeopleSoft Enterprise Portal
     Applications patches in the Updates are cumulative; each successive
     Critical Patch Update contains the fixes from the previous Critical
     Patch Updates.
     Oracle E-Business Suite and Applications patches are not
     cumulative, so E-Business Suite and Applications customers should
     refer to previous Critical Patch Updates to identify previous fixes
     they wish to apply.
