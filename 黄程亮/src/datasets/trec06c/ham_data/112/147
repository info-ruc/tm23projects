   It would have to be recording responses continuously or you will have to 
break the audio into sections.  You could put markers in the file and tell 
DMDX to play between the markers but that's as much work as breaking it 
into sections.

   The square brackets are probably breaking things in your <ztr [200]>, 
<ztr 200> is what you want.  Not that you'll be able to gather 200 
character strings as they won't fit on the screen.  If you suppress 
feedback with <nfb> it will work.
