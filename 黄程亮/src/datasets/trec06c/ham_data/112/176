   Depends on the size of the effect you will be trying to measure.  If 
it's only a 5 millisecond effect then imposing an additional variability of 
over a millisecond to the RTs isn't going to be so great.  If on the other 
hand you're looking for a 50 millisecond effect then the larger SD isn't 
going to be any problem.  Not that you couldn't measure the 5 ms effect 
with the larger SD, you'll just need more trials...
