LOCKSS Launches Community Initiative to Preserve Scholarly Content

Boston Mass, January 23, 2006 =96 A group of=20
publishers, librarians, and learned societies=20
have launched an initiative employing the LOCKSS=20
(Lots of Copies Keep Stuff Safe) technology to=20
support a =93large dark archive=94 that serves as a=20
failsafe=20
<http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/D/dark_archive.html%23##>repository=20
for published scholarly content.

The initiative, Controlled LOCKSS (CLOCKSS), aims=20
to provide assurance to the research community=20
that a disaster, which would prevent the delivery=20
of content, will not obstruct access to journal content.

CLOCKSS content or the =93orphaned content=94 would=20
only become available after a =93trigger=94 event,=20
such as the material was no longer available from=20
the publisher. In these situations, a joint=20
advisory board, representing societies,=20
publishers and libraries, will begin the process=20
to determine if the content is orphaned and=20
whether it should be made publicly available. The=20
board ensures that content is controlled but that=20
no one person or sector has authority over=20
orphaned digital materials in the system.

=93Our community needs to ensure that when content=20
becomes orphaned there is a process through which=20
it becomes publicly accessible,=94 said Vicky=20
Reich, Director LOCKSS Program, Stanford=20
University Libraries. =93The CLOCKSS project offers=20
an alternative solution to archiving and its=20
strength lies in the fact that it has been=20
founded by publishers and librarians and will remain collectively managed.=
=94

CLOCKSS provides additional functionality to the=20
LOCKSS system, which is widely known in the=20
scholarly communications world as a technology=20
for ensuring the integrity of digital content,=20
and is used as part of preservation strategies=20
for electronic journals to which libraries=20
subscribe. CLOCKSS also differs from LOCKSS in=20
that participating libraries will archive both=20
subscribed and non-subscribed journals, with the=20
ultimate goal of archiving all of the journals of participating publishers

=93As more scholars rely upon access to electronic=20
journals, it has become critical to explore ways=20
to ensure long-term availability of journal=20
content,=94 says Karen Wittenborg, University=20
Librarian, University of Virginia. =93This=20
collaborative initiative addresses the=20
uncertainty that librarians have confronted in=20
the digital environment and shows promise of=20
offering a real solution for long-term preservation.=94

The initial two-year pilot will include at least=20
five research libraries, and several commercial=20
and society publishers. During this time,=20
publishers and libraries will continue to work=20
closely to collect and analyze data and develop a=20
proposal for a full-scale archiving model. As=20
part of a longer-term strategy to permanently=20
preserve published work, CLOCKSS will report the=20
findings to the wider community and begin the=20
dialogue about a global infrastructure to ensure=20
preservation of all past, present, and future scholarly content.
