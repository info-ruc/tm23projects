I have never actually realized the power of jealousy until reading part  of Beloved. But it in reality its quite obvious.  Jealousy leads  to pride which leads to selfish action and that ultimately breaks a  community.  That community was all that these freed slaves could  count on.  Sadly, they had nothing but themselves and their unity,  and these people who relied upon each other, who had shared the same  unbearable pain, who had tremendous respect for the healing power of  Baby Suggs, they were even able to allow jealousy to cut those strong  chains.  This community, like Paul D’s chains, was the only thing  that they were given the best of as a result of their oppression.   The way she displays the strength of jealously really made an  impression on me with the contrast of the deep bonds of the  community.   I obviously was aware of the strength of jealous  emotion, but Toni Morrison further opened up my eyes to this ugly  aspect of human nature.
