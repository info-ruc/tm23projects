Dear Romanian Club,

My name is Joe, and I am representing an event called the Veritas Forum.  W=
e
will be hosting a benefit concert on February 9th, 2006 to cap a week in
which we have created a forum to discuss issues relating to global
suffering.  From Monday February 6th to Wednesday February 8th, we have
invited several established professionals, both in industry and academia, t=
o
discuss issues such as the question of poverty and human rights around the
world.  This year our speakers include Professor Philip Kitcher, Jeffery
Sachs and New York Times columnist Nicolas Kristof, among other prominent
individuals.

We are writing this email to ask for your monetary support for our
culminating event, which will feature an indie band, *The Cinematic
Underground*.  The support raised through this event will go to aid a
village in Northern Uganda.  We have formed a partnership with World Vision=
,
and have assumed financial responsibility for supporting this village.  If
you are unfamiliar with the situation in Northern Uganda, please visit
www.invisiblechildren.com.  We have also partnered with these filmmakers to
publicize the current crisis for the children in Northern Uganda.

Please consider a financial donation to this cause.  If you have any
questions about the event, or the specifics of a donation, please feel free
to contact me at jkh2107@columbia.edu.  If you would like to know more abou=
t
The Veritas Forum, please go to www.columbia.edu/veritas. The website is
still under construction, but will be updated on a regular basis.  We hope
to hear from you shortly.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
Joseph Ho
