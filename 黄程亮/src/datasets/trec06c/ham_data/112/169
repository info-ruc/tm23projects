No,
I'm sorry - I removed everything with diagnostics and testmode from the rtf-File..and 
the checkbox in DMDX-Dialogue - the problem was still there...

Now, I got reaction times in the result file and all seems fine...

========

I'm sorry I did not protocol every step I made but here is what I did so far:

I switched to another experiment "picture" in the dmdx-tutorial.zip

I tried to use {umb | umpr | umnr}
tried to experiment with <id #Tastatur> <mpr +#3> ... => wrong syntax:
Syntax check gave me: "button name <+#3> not found on input devices"

Then I came to: <id #keyboard> 
and I switched to <zil> instead of <azk> and suddenly I realized there appear the times 
when I pushed a button and i wondered...

switched back to <azk> and : it worked

It seems to me that the point is: for non-english keyboards ("Tastatur" instead of 
"keyboard") one has to have the <id #keyboard> setting ...(NOT <#Tastatur!> which I 
used first)

I can't say whether it was crucial to use some unmapping once but this is working now 
for me:

<azk> <cr> <fd 17> <d 169> <t 2500> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 60> <id #mouse> <id 
#keyboard> <nfb> <dbc 255255255> <dwc 0>
....


Thanks for all....

I'm looking forward to explore DMDX more deeply now :)

Kind regards,

Axel
