Hi all

Please make sure to vote in the ballot using the ballot forms you should all have received last week.  The employers promised they would spend a third of the income from extra top-up fees on extra salaries (I heard it on the news at the time!), and now they are denying that they made that promise.

See below for more details
cheers

Dear colleague,



Employers spin themselves into a hole as Johnson confirms "at least one
third" commitment...

In an article for the Times Higher this week Geoffrey Copland the chair of
employers' body UCEA denied that universities had ever told former HE
minister Alan Johnson that "at least one-third" of the new money would be
spent on your pay.



In a briefing for press and university staff members last week, UCEA went
further and said: "no such commitment has ever been given to Government by
universities -- collectively or individually."



Yet on the very same day that Dr Copland's article was published Alan
Johnson, the minister who had reported the universities' pay commitment to
parliament, addressed a meeting at University College London.  When asked
about the commitment, Mr. Johnson confirmed that it was no less than
Universities UK themselves who had told him that was what universities said
they would do.



The transcript of the meeting (which AUT has on tape) reads:



London Student reporter: "When you said vice-chancellors [had told you they
would spend at least a third on pay] was that based on a conversation with
a few vice-chancellors or was it based on a conversation with
vice-chancellors representing universities across the sector, all
universities?"



Alan Johnson:  "It was based on Universities UK."



If there is one thing worse than spinning, it is being caught spinning,
especially when you are accusing the unions of bad faith.  One AUT member
present at the meeting speculated whether there was some confusion during
that infamous meeting and when Alan Johnson asked UUK the question; one of
the great and good misheard and thought he had asked how much would be
spent on VC pay.



Stop spinning, start negotiating AUT tells employers

Now that their central argument against meeting the unions' claim has been
exposed as a sham AUT hopes the employers will come back to the bargaining
table with a decent offer.



Not a good day for the employers and it gets worse...

Many members have contacted us about the advert placed in the Time Higher
Education Supplement (THES) yesterday.  Yes, the employers did indeed spend
money that they could have spent on you on a full page ad that stressed
their willingness to resolve the dispute.  Yes they did call for "dialogue
not dispute" and yes they did list all the wonderful things they are doing
for you already.  Why are the unions being so unreasonable was the
sub-text.



Employers talk "peace", but privately plan hard line on "peculiar" staff

There is one slight problem with this very uncharacteristic UCEA charm
offensive.  A colleague received in a brown envelope this week a copy of a
private email exchange between a Head of Human Resources at a leading
English University and his counterpart at a university of similar stature
in Scotland. The subject: our pay dispute.



The correspondence starts with the English person describing you and
colleagues as working in a "peculiar industry" and goes on to say that the
current dispute is "unreal" even by the usual "academic standards".  Nice
to know what your employers secretly think of you isn't it - especially
that the term "academic" is a form of insult rather than a complement.



However it gets worse.  What we need to do, he says, is tell staff that
everyone who refuses to mark scripts and set exams in this dispute "would
be taken off the payroll until they agreed to work normally". The
implication is that this hard line tactic would then frighten you and your
colleagues into voting no.



What a good idea, his colleague from Scotland replies.  "I welcome the
initiative for the employers' side to take a strong line in this dispute."



Interesting that in the very week that these two are plotting to frighten
staff out of standing up for their rights, their respective vice
chancellors were sending out the standard UCEA message of peace, love and
understanding to all staff. Dialogue, not dispute indeed....



So who said what to whom?

This is a good point at which to launch our first members' competition of
this dispute.  Do the attitudes expressed in the email sound like those of
your Head of HR?  Email us if you think these master tacticians could be
based at your institution? AUT is offering a mystery prize to the first
person who correctly guesses one of these two institutions who are the
advisors behind UCEA's "talk peace, prepare for war" strategy.  And just so
members in Wales and Northern Ireland are left out, we will provide a
similar prize for the best piece of management dissembling about your pay
we receive.



The identity of these two will be announced next week when we publish the
full exchange to the press and winners will be announced in next Friday's
email.



What do you want?  Some of what you've got would be nice!

Seriously, what this does show is that the employers are on the defensive.
This follows AUT's revelation that while refusing to make you an offer on
pay, the eleven vice chancellors on the UCEA Board had received average pay
increases of 32% over the last three years!  The employers keep asking what
it is the unions want.  Well, we want some of what you have awarded
yourselves is the answer.



Before we leave this subject will have to tell you what the employers told
the press about this story.  A UCEA spokesman said of these VCs that "their
remuneration packages reflect what it takes to attract, retain and reward
individuals of sufficient calibre." AUT couldn't agree more.  Read what The
Guardian said about this at
http://education.guardian.co.uk/higher/news/story/0,9830,1689436,00.html.



If UCEA want dialogue, let's do it today!

AUT DOES want dialogue.  We are prepared to negotiate today, but we are not
prepared to remove your right to vote against the employers while they
"consult" with institutions.  We want a negotiated solution but we will
negotiate from a position of strength not weakness.



Stand up and be counted

Not a bad day's work for the employers:


  * Caught out by the minister on the one-third commitment.
  * Found out by AUT for planning a secret "hard line" while pretending to
want "dialogue"    * In print showing contempt for "academic standards"
  * Shown up as believing that VCs need decent pay to be retained but not
prepared to pay you a penny more



Can things get any worse for them?  Yes.



Many members tell us that things like this make them angry at the way they
are treated, not just about pay but about workloads, increased bureaucracy
and a lack of promotion prospects.  Now is the time to register that
protest, to put that anger to some purpose.  Your union is battling on your
behalf to make the employers keep their promises.



Do not be a passive observer while others defend your pay and conditions.
If you haven't voted yet support your union and do so now, and when you do
- VOTE YES to send your employers a message that even they can understand.



Please pass this email onto any colleagues who are not yet in AUT.  They
still have time to join the union and vote.  They can go to
http://www.aut.org.uk/index.cfm?articleid=10 and we will email them a form
by return.



all/best
