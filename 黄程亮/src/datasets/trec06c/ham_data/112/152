Hi, everyone.

From what I read in the help file, it seems that DMDX has predefined
mappings for keyboard, mouse and other devices.

I might be quite wrong here, but could it be that these only apply to
devices which are named "Keyboard" and "Mouse" ?

If that were the case, since you have a device named "Maus", you would
need to map request, positive, and negative responses in the .rtf file,
using the <mr>, <mpr>, and <mnr> commands.

Thanks,

João
