Dear Student Group Leader,

Over the past two years, the Student Coalition on Expansion and
Gentrification has worked to ensure that community perspectives on
Columbia's expansion into West Harlem are heard on campus. Because
Columbia's planning process is moving so quickly, this semester a
critically important one -- and your organization's involvement is
key.

We hope you will consider being part of the Coalition by sending a
liaison to our Representative Board.

The Rep Board meets once a month -- the first meeting of the semester
will be Sunday, February 5 at 7:00pm in Kent 424. At the meetings, Rep
Board members will get updated on Columbia's expansion, community
response and what students are doing. We also hope that SCEG can work
with your group to co-sponsor at least one activity directly related
to both the mission of your group and to the expansion.

Please let us know by by the end of this week, 1) whether your group
might be interested in participating in the coalition and assigning a
liaison to the Rep Board and 2) whether you would like a member of
SCEG to come to one of your group's meetings to talk more about what's
up with expansion and what involvement in the Coalition would entail.

Thanks very much, and we look forward to working with you.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
And now!
     I must choose
                          between
     the paradox of
victory of the spirit,
despite physical hunger,
                or
     to exist in the grasp
of American social neurosis,
sterilization of the soul
      and a full stomach.
