The aims and objectives of the study are:
    * To scope the requirements of e-research=20
within the area of resource discovery with=20
reference to =91portal=92 type services and tools.
    * To identify gaps and duplication within the=20
current provision (with reference to JISC portal=20
and other relevant activity) therefore to=20
identify potential areas for new work and=20
possibly synergies that could offer a more=20
holistic approach than currently available.
    * To highlight issues and challenges that=20
will need addressed in terms of serving=20
e-Research requirements and in terms of enhancing=20
portal activity for the IE more generally.
    * To make recommendations for portal related=20
activity that could be taken forward by JISC.

The deadline for receipt of tenders is 1300 hours=20
on Friday 3rd March 2006. Funding of up to=20
