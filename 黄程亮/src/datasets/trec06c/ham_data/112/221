Hello,

Due to some technical issues, we need you to submit your RER I again on the blackboard if you had submitted it already. Please go to RER assignment, and submit the same one that you submitted (if you did already) at "RER I". The deadline for it is midnight, Jan 30. Thanks! 

201 RER graders
