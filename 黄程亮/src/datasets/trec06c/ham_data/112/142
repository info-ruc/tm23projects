I want to use DMDX to present some speech and record a typed response 
(participants type the sentence they hear). I have two questions regarding 
this.

First, is it possible for DMDX to play a sound file and record responses at 
a number of points throughout the file? I have 35 sentences playing in 
continuous noise and ideally, I would like the participants to type in what 
they hear after each sentence without having to split the file into smaller 
files. Would the sound file need to be marked to tell DMDX when to record a 
response?

Secondly, I can't seem to get DMDX to record a typed response. My script 
which plays 4 wav files is below. It runs fine but the output file is 
always blank.

I would appreciate any advice on these two questions!

Thanks,
Rachel
