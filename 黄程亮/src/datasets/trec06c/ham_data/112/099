Its a brand new machine, only arrived just before Xmas and I have 
already downloaded the latest drivers from Dell.

Have tried the "Really bad cards" - did not seem to help but I tried 
"DMDX -buffers 2" and it looked better (actually worked all the way 
on the first attempt but locked up on the second).  A few attempts 
using "-buffers 2" gives me a lockup rate of about 50% of trials 
compared to close to 100% before.

The Dell Optiplex GX520 uses Intel 945G Express Chipset on the M/B.
