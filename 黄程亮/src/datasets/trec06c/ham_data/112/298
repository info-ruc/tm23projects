So, at 3:00 this morning, after being way, way behind on my reading, I finally finished Beloved. And, I am proud to say, I never Sparknoted a single thing. 8-) I kept hoping Toni would answer some of the questions she raised, but she didn't. I'm still confused as to what Beloved was--a ghost? Something else? Why exactly did she run? What were the women singing/chanting? And, why naked? I'm not just saying that out of some immature giggling, I'm honestly interested. Considering she showed up in brand new shoes and a brand new dress, and Sethe made a big deal out of making the three women new clothes in "carnival colors," the fact that she ran off naked seemed odd. Was is part of the whole rebirth idea? Also, is this why Beloved was described as "pregnant" and Sethe as "a little girl"? Is this like Paul D coming back in the reverse path of how he had left? Like the shift from past to present tenses? Come to think of it, there are many parts of the end that were somehow completions in a
 cycle, rotation and reversals in some way. I did kind of like that Sethe tried to reverse what had happened when schoolteacher had come the first time, by this time attacking before he could enter her yard (even though it wasn't schoolteacher, but Mr. Bodwin, there was something cyclic about the act that i liked. I also liked the fact that the first door Denver knocked on for help was Lady Jones, for the same reason--I like it when things end where there started...)
   
  Also, I'm still not sure a) Why Paul D came to 124; b) why he left; or c) why he came back.
   
  I wish I enjoyed this book more than I did. I really respect Toni Morrison as a person and as a writer, and I think she really had a message in this book. I hate that this message was largely lost on me in the confusions and twists of the book. Anyone agree?
