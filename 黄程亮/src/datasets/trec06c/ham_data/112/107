I am trying DMDX for the first time, and am looking for helpful
resources.  Would anyone with scripts for visual search or attentional
cueing share their code?  Or is there a common depository where people
share such files (such as http://nbs.neuro-bs.com/jones which mostly
has Presentation-coded files)?  I would be happy to share anything I
produce with this system as well.

Thanks!
