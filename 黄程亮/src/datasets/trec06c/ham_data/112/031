Here are some thought questions regarding this paper. You do not have to 
write up the answers, and they will not be graded. However, if you are 
auditing this class then you cannot come to Monday's class unless you 
read them all. Warning: Bill may veto any or all of these questions if 
found inappropriate.

-> Has power consumption been an issue for computer architecture in the 
past? If so, how did it compare with today’s power issues and how was it 
solved?

-> How does the power consumption of a CPU in a laptop compare to the 
total energy needed to run the laptop? Why would CPU power usage matter?

-> Does running two identical processors require twice the power of 
running one processor at the same frequency? .

-> What design aspects of a given *microarchitectural* feature in 
current processors contribute most to high power requirements? How is 
this changing over time? (Think of structures inside the core.)

Extra Credit:

-> What role could software play in power reduction that would be 
independent of any system hardware or specific API? How significant 
might this be in solving the power issue?

-> In real-world, physical terms (not an abstract analogy), what exactly 
is "voltage"?
