In response to Angelae's 2nd response and my first one as well...
  
  Though it seems that Sethe is trying to shut out the rest of the  community, she does not take such an unwelcome tone when Beloved first  appears, and this was before she realized who she actually was.   So my take on this is that she knew subconsciously, somehow, who  Beloved was because Beloved has this sort of suconcious power over  people.  She gives the impression of innocence, curiosity, and  ability to love and neediness.  When Sethe realizes that Beloved  is who she is, she is relieved almost because it shows her ability as a  mother has not gone completely stale.  One would think that their  family is tied together once again when Sethe comes to the realization  of who Beloved actually is.   One may assume that she can take her  past and "forget it all now" just has Angelae has written, but I think  we are all still wondering how Sethe is going to handle and resolve Denver's  resistancy to trust Sethe and feel secure in their connection with all  three of each other.  I
 want to know what is going to be the event  that brings Denvers back into that connection of trust and love so that  there is not a kink in that three-person chain.  Now, instead of  Beloved being the one that needs to be rescued and resurrected, it's  Denver.  Also, I'd like to know where Paul D will stand on this  connection and whethere he is going to occupy a fourth spot on that  chain.
  
  Kara Swami.
