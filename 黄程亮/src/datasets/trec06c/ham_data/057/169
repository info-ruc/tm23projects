  Depends which device you used, the RawJoystick device imposes minimal
overhead, the regular Joystick device poses a significant overhead however.

"Yacc" owes much to a most stimulating collection of users, who have
goaded me beyond my inclination, and frequently beyond my ability in
their endless search for "one more feature".  Their irritating
unwillingness to learn how to do things my way has usually led to my
doing things their way; most of the time, they have been right.
