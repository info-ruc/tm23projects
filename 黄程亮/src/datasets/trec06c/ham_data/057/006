Mark,

The answer to both is YES.  Remove the four screws from the corners of
the HB and remove the board and batteries from the plastic box.  Cut 
the battery wires and add a polarized two wire connector.  Then you are
able to substitute any desired alternate battery source (with lead 
length as required for your installation).  You can even use a LEGO 9V
battery box.  Get out your LEGOs and the bare HB.  Use a flat plate
and your choice of blocks and try different configurations ... use
an epoxy (such as JB Weld) to make your custom enclosure permanent.

Good luck and have fun,
 - Nick -
