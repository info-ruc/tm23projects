Subject: Where is dl for unix?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi,

I need to get the dl program to load the bootstrap code on my
handyboard. I seem to remember that it used to live on the handyboard
site with the contribution code, but I've pretty much had a look
everywhere and could not find it.

Anyone knows where can I find it?

Thanks a million.

- martin
