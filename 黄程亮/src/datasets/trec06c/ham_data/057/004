unstalled that software later.
I will try disabling and then enabling the com port.
Thanks

Kalyan,

During the two weeks that you didn't use your HB did you install any
software that uses _any_ serial port?  When I installed Windows CE
Services it interfered with serial I/O.  To talk to other serial
devices on com1 it's necessary to disable and then enable the com
port.
