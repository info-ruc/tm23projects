Michael:

    You will not get your program to outrun light.  The rf signal is moving=20
at 300,000,000 m/s.  If you divide the space between your antennas by=20
300,000,000 you will get the time difference for the rf arrival time.  I=20
believe you will find that time to be much smaller than a single machine=20
cycle.  You might be able to use this trick with a sound wave and assembler=20
programming, but not rf.
    If you want to find a radio source, I recommend "Transmitter Hunting"=20
published by the ARRL.  They might have it in your local library; they are=20
most likely to have The ARRL Handbook which will have a section on=20
directional antennas.  You could probably build a "Loop with sense" type=20
antenna that you would mount on a turning servo.  You sample the signal=20
strength at different directions and pick the strongest (weakest depending o=
n=20
the antenna).  Finding the "Null" direction usually gives a sharper position=
=20
than finding the "Peak."

Good Luck,
Pherd
