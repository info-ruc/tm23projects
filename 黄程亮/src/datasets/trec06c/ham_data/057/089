Yes it does.  Look in the Handy_Board_1.2.icd file that came on your 3.x
disc.  That file specifies the .s19 pcode file to load and any other
files to be loaded at startup of IC 3.x.  You can either change those to
some special name you have created for your smooth PWM pcode and library
files that you got off the Handy Board site, or you can just move the
old files to some other place on your HD and replace them in the IC file
with the ones off the site.

Please keep in mind that there *may* be some variation between the way
the old and new libraries work.  I haven't found any problems like this
on the Handy Board, but I know when you use the Rug Warrior libraries
that come with version 3.2 of the IC package, the motor functions use
floating point variables for the velocity input, eg: motor (0,50.);
instead of the int variable in the latest version of the freeware.  A
comparison between the two libraries is probably in order if you have
some difficulty with programs that used to run, but don't with the
smooth PWM library.
