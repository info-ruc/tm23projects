A gamepad sounds like the best option (duh.... sometimes I miss the really
obvious).  This is especially the case since I'll be using the PIO12 to
trigger my Neuroscan system.

I love this... I'm saving a LOT of money (read over a grand in software and
hardware costs), AND I am getting the best stimulus presentation
capabilities possible.  This is great!!!  You've really outdone yourself
this time, Jonathan.

One more question:  Will the clock speed of the computer matter much?  Does
a Pentium III 600 have a lower error rate than a Pentium Classic 100,
assuming that the video card remains constant?  It seems like it might...
I'll be making some decisions about equipment allocation, so this info will
be most helpful.

cheers,

JK
