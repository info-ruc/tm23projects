Hi,
Someone posted a note in early Oct indicating timing inaccuracies in DMDX.
Jonathan replied and indicated that DMDX's timing is very accurate, and I
have no doubt that it is. Do you know if this person found the cause of his
timing problem?

Since then, I have discovered a similar problem with timing in my lab. I
have a 750-second file that presents large bmp files and collects no
responses. When I time it with a stopwatch, it is inaccurate by + or - 3
sec. DMDX reports no errors in the diagnotics file. I noticed the problem
in Win98 and then tried Win95 and the problem remained. I'd appreciate your
suggestions as to how I might fix this problem.
Eddie
