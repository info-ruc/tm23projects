     Dear ?:
     
     First off, your program contains an infinite loop; statement 
     return(0); will never be reached. Also you told it that main does 
     not return a value, yet you used e return in the end. This will 
     generate a compiler error for sure.
     
     I belief the IC parser expects main to be defined as follows:
     
     int main()
     
     {
     
     /* code here */
     }
     
     
     
     Second: You only need to execute the initialization statement 
     init_expbd_servos(1); ones.
     
     Third: Your statements need to be terminated with a ; in order for 
     the parser to recognize them as two individual statements.
     
     Fourth: I am not sure if setting the variable servo0 to 1000 is the 
     correct way of controlling servo #0. But it might be.
     
     Rewrite your program as follows:
     
     int main()
     {
        init_expbd_servos(1);
        servo0 = 1000;
        return(0);
     }

Can anyone please write me a brief servo motor program 
that will control two servos from the expansion board?
     
This the one I had to control one, but did not work:
     
void main(void)
{
    while(1)
        {
                init_expbd_servos(1) 
                 servo0 = 1000
        }
     
     return(0);
}
