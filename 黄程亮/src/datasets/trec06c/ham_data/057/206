Oops.  I realize I didn't provide much info in my previous post so I'll t=
ry
more explicit.

I've built the entire charger/serial interface unit and was following the
final debug steps but was stopped at the last step of 3.2.2 in the assemb=
ly
manual.

The manual says:

Finally, the MAX232=92s ability to transmit data to the host computer is
tested. Again
using pin 7 of J9 as a ground reference, measure the voltage at pin 3 of =
J9.
This is
the MAX232=92s serial output. It should read between _9 and _10 volts. No=
w
temporarily
jumper the _10 volt supply (pin 6 of the MAX232) to pin 10 of the MAX232,
which is
the input side of this output stage. Again measure the voltage at pin 3 o=
f
J9=97it should
now read between + 9 and+ 10 volts.

Well, this is where I'm off.  I read ~3.5 volts.

I'm using the MAX232ACPE part.

Might there be a defect?  I've checked my soldering and things look okay.

Also, when I attempt to download the pcode_hb.s19 I'm not getting anythin=
g
to communicate.  The green TX led on the serial board is not lighting at =
all
when I mess around with the wiring.  I'm using a standard db25 M to F
rs-232C cable.  I've wired up a DB9 to DB25 cable to see if it was my ser=
ial
port but when I attach it, the green light goes on and doesn't go off.  D=
ata
still doesn't appear to be coming through the serial board.

I'm at a loss as to what might be wrong.

Thanks again!
