Hi ... It sounds as though you are obtaing the power for your servo
from the HandyBoard's motor output pins ... and if so, this is the
source of your problem.  The HB does NOT control motor speed by
varying the DC level ... it uses PWM to reduce the average DC level
sent to the motors ... and your servo requires a +5V DC source for
its power.  As a general rule the servo should NOT get its +5v from
the same source that powers your microcontroller because the high
load imposed by the servo under mechanical load may cause your power
source to sag and possible cause a reset. Try using 3 AA or C cells
to power your servo, but be certain that the negative end of your
batteries is connected to the HandyBoard's ground ... otherwise your
servo will still be erratic.  If you are using the HB's expansion
board, then it supplies the required +5V directly to the servos
by using the large diodes to drop the voltage to a value that is
okay for the servos (they like from 4.8 to 6.0V for their power).

Good luck,
 - Nick -
