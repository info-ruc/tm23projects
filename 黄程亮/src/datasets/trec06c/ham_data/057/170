My understanding of "RawJoystick" is that you're constrained to a few
button assignments:  The game pad has many (I believe eight in all... I
believe that it's a Gravis, if memory serves me correctly).  Unfortunately,
the layout and default button assignments make it ergonomically
impractical... The use of the drivers that came with the joystick makes
this less of a consideration.

I'll try it with the monster PIII 550 when it comes and let you know how I
fair.  If the number of missed ticks remains unacceptable, I'll wire the
game pad into junction box for the PIO12.

The good news, is that there are many, many options here... and none of
them expensive or technically prohibitive.  Those Friday evening Doom and
Quake sessions paid off in ways that I could never have imagined!

cheers,

John
