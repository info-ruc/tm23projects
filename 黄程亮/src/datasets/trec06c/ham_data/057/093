Hi,

      I got one alphanumeric plasma display 40 char X
8 lines made by  industrial electronics engineers from
a surplus store for $7.50. But i didn't have any
litarature about this product. I tried to search for
their web site but no luck. If any one have any
information please let me know.  I want to run this
display with HB.

Thank you
Robo
