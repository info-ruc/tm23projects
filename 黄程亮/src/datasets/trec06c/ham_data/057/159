Healthcare Committee
====================

- In October, the Healthcare Committee completed the National Assoc. of
  Graduate - Professional Student's (NAGPS) health insurance survey,
  filling in information about BU's student insurance plan and campus
  health services.  The Healthcare Committee contributed to this
survey's
  creation earlier in the year.

- NAGPS has collected some basic statistics from the 24 institutions
  that have answered the survey so far (more statistics will come from
  the NAGPS in the future).  Some interesting statistics are
(percentages
  and fractions are out of the number of institutions that responded to
  a particular question, list as N below):

  - BU's premium of $576 is lower than the average of $644.25 (N=24).
    BU's premium for spouses is also lower than average (N=19).  (This
    does not take into account how our "coverage" compares to the other
    plans.)

  - 1/3 of institutions subsidize at least part of the premium for some
    subset of graduate students (N=18).

  - 1/4 of institutions don't require grads to purchase insurance, i.e.,

    neither the state nor the institution mandates this (N=24).

  - 61% of institutions have fees for using student health services,
    including BU, whose fee is comparatively low (N=23).

  - 43% have domestic partner coverage available (N=21).

- Healthcare Committee members have been assigned to update Healthcare
  Pages (http://gso.bu.edu/healthcare) write-ups of:

  - MassHealth
  - Healthnet

FAR Committee
=================

- How to improve the experience of Teaching Fellows at BU
The planned expansion of orientation programs (sponsored by the GRS) for
new Teaching Fellows was discussed.  Also, the possibility of using the
class that TF's take (#699) to help them be better teachers was brought
up.  At the departmental level, we should encourage the use of this
class as something more than another course TF's sign up for each
semester.

Liaison Committee
=================

The following information comes from a meeting with Andrea White
(assistant to Assoc. Dean Whitaker) on November 17, 1999:

- GRS is still planning a mandatory end-of-summer orientation for all
  new students arriving as Teaching Fellows next Fall.  Int'l TFs
  will arrive first (tentatively, August 22) and go through the same
  kinds of language evaluation given at last year's orientation.
  Domestic TFs will arrive later (date not yet determined) when joint
  International/Domestic TF training (like "practice teaching") and
  events will begin.  The program will run until the tentative date of
  August 31.  GRS is currently looking for accommodations for the
  expected number of students.

- Andrea suggested we take advantage of each dept's "graduate student
  orientation" as another means to introduce students to the GSO.  This
  may be possible as we acquire dept reps for each dept/program.

- Andrea still has not done a survey of grad stipends at other local
  schools (she has said that if she does one, she'd ask the dean
  whether she could share those statistics with the GSO).

- Andrea stated that information on "what other schools have" can
  be useful in arguing for certain resources with the administration.

  In the context of acquiring a reasonable grad student/GSO lounge, our
  liaison acquired some information about what "space" grads/grad orgs
  at other local schools have this past summer--we should use this
  information when the lounge issue is revisited.

- GRS will allow us to place a flyer in mailings to new Spring grads
  and/or the packets they receive when they arrive.  We will prepare
  something with information about the resources available at our web
  site for that purpose.

Library Privileges
------------------

As of the meeting, Assoc. Dean Whitaker had not responded to an e-mail
sent on November 12th inquiring about the state of his efforts to
discuss
library privilege improvements for grads with the library
administration.
Andrea White could not provide any information on that state.

To this end, what to do as a next step was discussed during this
general GSO meeting.  The consensus at the meeting was for the liaison
to send one more request (as a paper letter) expressing students'
concerns
about how that process is proceeding and then to give Whitaker the rest
of the semester before taking additional action.

Publicity Committee
===================

The system administrator for our GSO server (gso.bu.edu), Dave Morgan
<dmorgan@math.bu.edu>, asked whether any students knew of a machine the
GSO could use to replace its server.  Recently, the machine the GSO
uses, a machine lent to the GSO from Math, was down because that dept
used it to temporarily replace an ailing Math machine.  To avoid
problems
like this in the future, the GSO is looking for a machine that can be
dedicated solely to act as our server.  Such a machine could be an old
486, Sun Workstation, etc. that either a dept or individual is willing
to donate.


December
========

We will elect officers at the December meeting.
