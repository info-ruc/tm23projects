Another note regarding this:  The dl that I'm using is an a.out version
rather than an elf executable, and I quite often need to use it on a Red
Hat 6.x version of Linux.  Red Hat 6.0 and later doesn't have a.out support
running automatically, so as root you need to load
"/lib/modules/<kernel version>/fs/binfmt_aout.o"

"insmod binfmt_aout.o" is the command I think.  I don't remember whether
you need the ".o" or not, but use "insmod binfmt_aout" if not.

For those that are curious:  a.out is the old executable format used
for Linux, and elf is the newer format.  The command above just adds
in a kernel module to the running kernel to enable it to recognize and
use a.out executables.  It will have no ill effects.

The other fix for this problem is to recompile dl from sources, but I
haven't gotten around to doing this yet.  Once I do that it'll be an
elf executable.
