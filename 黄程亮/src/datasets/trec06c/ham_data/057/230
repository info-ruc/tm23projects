Hi,

can somebody help me with my problem, please?

1. the 'servo_a7.icb' and 'servo_a7.asm' files have been downloaded from the
Handyboard page and they are free of Ctrl M's or Ctrl J's. however, when i try
loading the 'servo_a7.icb' file, i get

Fatal Internal Error: Illegal Line in .s19 file.

what's the problem and what's the remedy?

2. could you give me a simple example of how the "int servo_a7_pulse" and "int
servo_a7_init(int enable)" can be used to control the servo. i don't understand
how or where they fit in.

please reply soon. thanx
