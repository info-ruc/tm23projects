Mike,

Don't think it's going to work.  186,000 miles per second is almost
1,000,000,000 feet per second ... so if your receiver antennas are
12 inches apart the time difference of the received pulse will be
0.001 microseconds maximum ... way too short to measure with your
HandyBoard.  You might give ultrasonics a try.

Good luck and have fun,
 - Nick -
