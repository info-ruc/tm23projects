Hi,

I'm again trying to connect the LM35 from National, there was some posts =
in
the list, but none of that solve my problem. As an introduction let me sa=
y
that the sensor provides an output of 10 mV/ =B0 C at 10 mA, the conversi=
on
when reading it trough the analog port will be 20 =B0C =3D 10 , (5 V / 25=
5
Levels ~ 20 mV / Level). So it seems all ok to directly connect the LM35 =
to
an analog port of the HB, more exactly to one port of de Exp-Board (witho=
ut
Pull-Up resistor to avoid problems), well I do that but the reading of th=
e
port gives a fix value of aprox. 170 (340 =B0C, well the clime is not so =
hot
here).
I have checked in the list archive and found no answer to this problem, t=
he
worst of this case is that I don't find nothing to explain this.

 For all this I hope someone of You have an idea to share about this
problem.

Thank You,

Jos=E9 Luis
