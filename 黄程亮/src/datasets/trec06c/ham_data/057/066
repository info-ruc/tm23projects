I've been using DMDX for over a year now and am really pleased with how it
works. Compared to any other system that I've used for running experiments
DMDX wins hands down in terms of ease of use, flexibility and reliability.

However, from experience of teaching beginners to use DMDX, the one part 
of DMDX that is in need of improvement is the documentation. Although
introductory tutorials are extremely valuable, sooner or later, most of us
have to go beyond a standard 'recipe' and figure out what the keywords mean
so that we can set up an
unusual experiment.

Unfortunately, in this respect, some of the help pages are lacking in the
sort of detail that would be useful on a day to day basis.  What would help
would be some informal method so that users can contribute to the
documentation. This would help extend the help pages provided with the
software and allow users to communicate their expertise to beginners more
easily.  In particular seeing a short piece of script with a switch or
keyword used in context would be extremely useful and would help users to
understand how to solve problems that come up time and time again.

What I propose is that a www site be set-up that includes an html version
of the current help pages. These www pages could include a section at the
bottom of each page with a simple form for users to submit their own
additions to the documentation. That way, when the time comes to update the
documentation, there would be (hopefully) be some suggestions from users
about things they found confusing about each of the help pages - and some
suggestions for improvements based on frequently asked questions. This
could also help provide suggestions for ways in which the documentation and
software be improved subsequently. 

I hope that people are keen to contribute to this project and that Ken and
Jonathan would be able to help out, either by hosting the project at U.
Arizona, or if this is problematic, by providing html versions of the
documentation so that we could set up this web site here in Cambridge.

Comments and suggestions would be welcomed.

Matt
