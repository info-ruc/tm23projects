Hello -
I'm having some trouble figuring out how to wire Precision Navigation's
Vector 2X Compass for use with the Handy Board.
I've checked out the files in ".../software/contrib/tomb/" on the Handy
Board site, but I'm sort of at a loss.
Due to the fact that I'm brand new at electronics I'm a bit hesitant to
try to wire anything without more explicit instructions....
More specifically, if someone could explain the symbols in the schematic
at ".../software/contrib/tomb/compass.gif", such as what's going on at the
'EOC' pin, and what the triangles mean at 'X-Flip' and 'M/S'.
More importantly, if anyone has a diagram (or can explain explicitly in
English) showing how and where the pins on the compass get wired to the
Handy Board/Expansion Board, that would be extremely helpful!
Thanks in advance!

CHRIS IRELAND
