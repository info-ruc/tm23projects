Yes I too received this virus - I did not open it though.    We had a copy
of it sent to where I work so I knew of it.  I hope that very few of you got
infected.

Regards -
Dave

But, honestly, I can't find his name in my records.  So really, I don't know
who this guy is, let alone try to get an idea of whether or not he's
ticked-off with our group...

This is a small price to pay to share ideas with people like yourselves.  At
