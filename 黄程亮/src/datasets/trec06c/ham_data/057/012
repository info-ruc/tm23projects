Thanks Nick.  Although I guess I was hoping for a more prepackaged
solution... especially with regards to the LEGO plastic enclosure.  Has
anybody ever thought of actually making them as a commercial product?  I
certainly can't be the only person who wants something a little more
like the programmable brick (which is not, afaik, available as a
commercial product at all), and thought that the Mindstorms RCX unit was
too inflexible.
