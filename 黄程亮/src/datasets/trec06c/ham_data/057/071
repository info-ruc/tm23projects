Hi,
my name is nicolas and I'm a french student in an engineering school at LYON.
I make a PCB with the L298N for the handy board. You must remove the L293D 
that you use for the motor 0 and 1. You put a connector in the socket 16 pin 
and this connector help the data going into the L298N. The PCB I build is 
6cm*10cm but I think I can do a smaller one maybe.
I can send you the PCB if you want or explain you how you can use the L298N 
with your handyboard.
If you need more current (4 A contiguous instead of 2 A) you can use one 
L298N for controlling just one motor. You put the 2 H-Bridges in parrallel.
kinds regards,
Nicolas.
