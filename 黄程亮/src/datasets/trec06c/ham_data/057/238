Subject: please delete "Pretty Park.exe"

hi everyone, some bozo sent us spam with a virus on it.  make sure
to delete "Pretty Park.exe".  i'm reporting the spam.  it's a little
confusing 'cause in the copy we received, it doesn't have handyboard@media
as a destination anywhere.

if spam problems on the list ramp up, i'll have to disabled the 
handyboard@media address and require people to go through the LUGNET
gateway, which does provide some spam protection.

fred
