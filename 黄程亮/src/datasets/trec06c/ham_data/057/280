Hi!

I bought my first handyboard in mid October and a Rug Warrior Pro in =
early November. And since I have had this peculiar download problem with =
the IC 3.2, pcode will download without any problems but everytime after =
downloading the lib files, IC will report a sync error. What makes it so =
odd is that I can download everything with the 2.81 version. I'm using a =
Win98 Toshiba Portege 7010 laptop as a host computer.

I have reported this to the IC Technical Support and they have replied =
that it's not the problem with the IC 3.2 rather with the laptop and I =
should use some other computer.

I tested the IC 3.2 in high speed NT workstation and it really worked =
there. No sync errors. (But I can't use this computer for my hobbies, =
and for mobile robots laptop is anyway the only proper host =
environment).

OK. I agree there are some differences between the Toshiba and NT =
workstation serial ports (although all the settable parameters had the =
same values). But my point is that how can then the IC 2.81 operate in =
the Toshiba laptop without any sync errors? Also, I haven't had any =
problems using for example external modem, Psion and Palm sync programs =
trough the same serial port. And finally, I received few days ago the =
BasicX-24 development kit and it works also very smoothly, no serial =
problems whatsoever (and it's fast).

So it seems that all other programs but IC can tolerate the minor =
differences with serial communication in different computers.

But what I'm really complaining is that there has been now 10 days since =
I send my last message to the Technical Support, and described the =
latest situation, but they haven't replied anything sofar. If the IC 3.2 =
were a freeware, the situation would be understandable but I have paid =
for the IC 3.2 and they ought to have better response times. I feel that =
the price for IC 3.2 is way too high, for that amount of money you =
should get a better quality program.
