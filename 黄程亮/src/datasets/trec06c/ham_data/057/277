Since the output ports for the motors of the handyboard supplies
11V, i connected a 5V regulator to power my servo. i have a capacitor between
the driver's + and - terminals. I looked at the control signal on the
oscilloscope. The duration of the pulse is correct, the period of the signal is
a about 20ms. the servo just buzzes.

        one thing i noticed: whenever the ground lead of the oscilloscope
is connected to the negative terminal of the motor driver port, the servo
spins only in one direction regardless of the duration of the control
signal's pulse. i measured the voltage of the negative terminal with
respect to ground, it is 1.03V.

        do i have a grounding problem in addition to the servo problem?

here's the code i used: basically the i keep sending a 0.2ms pulse till the
stop button is pressed. then a 2.4ms pulse till the button is pressed. then the
servo is turned off.

void main()
{
  fd(1);
  servo_a7_init(1);  /* activates PortA bit7 that gives the control signal */

  while (stop_button()==0)
  {servo_a7_pulse = 400;  /* a pulse with duration 0.2ms */
   sleep(0.0198);
  }

  while (stop_button()==0)
  {servo_a7_pulse=4840;    /* a pulse with duration 2.4ms */
   sleep(0.0176);
   }

   ao();
   servo_a7_init(0);                 /* disables port A bit7 */

}
