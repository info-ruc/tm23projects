Hi -

If you got it from a chineese named person it may not have been 'spam'.  We
got it at work and it wiped out one of our guy's computer completely.  I got
it from a somewhat familiar sounding name (chineese) but erased it last
night because I knew what it was.  Did not even want it in the deleted
folder (sorta wish I had kept it for tracking purposes now).   Please do not
run it - it is very nasty and is spread through the e-mail.

Regards -
Dave
