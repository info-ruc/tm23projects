         Two question i have:

1. On the Handyboard webpage, there're the files for the IR Remote Control
software. it's a little long and complicated. i'm purely interested in
activating the output ports and modulating it to transmit the 40khz signal and
detecting the received signal for proximity sensing. do you know where i can
obtain that library file?

also, can i plug the IR LED directly into the ports or do i need
some current limiting resistor of some value?

2. does anybody know of a reasonably priced, pinpoint, reflective IR LED/sensor
pair with short On-Off time and does not need to be very close to the surface?
