  No analog inputs, no demand for it here.  If someone wants to reimburse
me for doing it that'll be about the only way it'll happen unless someone
decides they've got to have it here.  It couldn't be polled at 1000Hz
anyway, polling the axes takes longer than a millisecond (unless you've got
one of them new fangled USB digital joysticks I guess), 100Hz maybe.
