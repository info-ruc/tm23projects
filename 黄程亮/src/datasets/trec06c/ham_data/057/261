kjleeUh, before anyone starts a witch-hunt, I'd suggest you examine the
headers a little more closely.  The message didn't come from this guy.  Even
if they did, I still wouldn't send him emails or bother him in any way -
it's too easy to fake headers, spoof posting-servers, or use unsecure relay
hosts.

The list was hit probably by some script-kiddie.  Anyone who runs EXE files
from people they don't know - and when they aren't expecting a file to be
sent - almost deserves the pain of de-virusing.  A little common sense,
coupled with a resident virus scanner (McAfee, Norton), is enough to protect
yourself.  Remember to update your DAT files regularly.
