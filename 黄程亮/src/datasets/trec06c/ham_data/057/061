Hi,

I=92m trying to get a robot to turn a face the owner
using rf.  I have one transmitter (that the owner will
wear) and three receivers (set up in a triangle).  We
want to use the transmitter as a beacon.  Then
whichever receiver gets the signal first, that=92s where
the owner is and where we want to turn to.  We can
transmit to the receivers, but we can=92t see which
receiver is getting the signal first.  I am trying to
look at the falling edge of one pulse.  In my program
any receiver with a high signal will set its time
variable to i (counter).  And the last time its high
corresponds to the falling edge.  The problem seems to
be the time of the loop is too slow and with in one
loop all the signals change (at the same time).  What
I would like to do is speed up the loop, if that is
possible. Can anyone help, is my thinking wrong?=20
Here, is my code:

float i, ta, tb, tc;
void main(void)
{
	ta=3D0.;
	tb=3D0.;
	tc=3D0.;
	i=3D0.;
	while (i<200.)			=09
	{
		if (digital(11)=3D=3D1)
			tb=3Di;
		if (digital(12)=3D=3D1)
			ta=3Di;
		if (digital(13)=3D=3D1)
			tc=3Di;
		i++;
	}
		printf("A%d B%d \rC%d\n",ta,tb,tc);
}


Mike
