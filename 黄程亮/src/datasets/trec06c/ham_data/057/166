Jonathan,

I bought a $20.00 game pad that works like a champ.  I was trying it out on
a P100 with 40 MB RAM and two video cards.. I am waiting for a PIII 550 MHZ
with 256 MB RAM, 20 GB HDD, and Matrox 32 MB 2X AGP video with dual monitor
support as my stimulus machine.

The P100 had only a couple of errors during the text mode of FEATURES.RTF
(modified to accept input from my game pad).  The graphics portion gave the
program a tic disorder, no doubt because the program had to keep polling
the game port.   

We'll be finding another use for that P100 box.

JK
