Hi,
I tried to download the pcode under Windows 2000 , but I got the same error.
So the problem is not with the COM port, must be something else.
When I switch the handyboard on I see squares on the first line of the LCD.

Thanks
Kalyan

Kalyan,

It looks to me like you've found your problem ... but unistalling the
software that uses the com port may NOT fix the problem.  You may need
an expert to dig into the registry to find the problem.  Once I have
the Windows CE Server installed, the problem remains until I reformat
the hard drive ... unistalling doesn't release its hook on the com port.

Good luck,
 - Nick -
