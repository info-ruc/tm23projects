  You can use the PIO12 and a button box wired into it at the same time.
You do of course need a PIO12 connector that busses signals to the
neuroscan and also accepts inputs.

  As a rule the faster the better :)  Depends on what you are trying to do
though, I have 300MHz K6 systems that never miss a beat under normal
circumstances, start pushing a bit of digital video around however and you
can see their weakness.  There are other machines that must have some kind
of configuration or driver issue that report display timing errors with
regularity, if a faster processor was put in them (keeping everything else
the same) I imagine the error rate would go down dramatically.

(8) Pedestrians are

	(a) irrelevant.
	(b) communists.
	(c) a nuisance.
	(d) difficult to clean off the front grille.

The correct answer is (a).  Pedestrians are not in cars, so they are
totally irrelevant to driving; you should ignore them completely.
