  No it's not in the DMDX docs.  The DMDX help file is a track record of
the things that are new to DMDX, I haven't tried to document the things
that are the same.  Scramble code is legacy stuff from DM days, I've fixed
the odd bug here and there and removed arbitrary limits in it, very little
of it differs from what it was when Ken wrote it nearly fifteen years ago.
