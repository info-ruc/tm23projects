Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

What is a good meathod to implement navigation on a robot with two
Polaroid sonars and basic two-motor steering?  I was doing research and
they use nueral networks and such, but I am not yet at the stage to
implement something that complex.  Thanks for any help you can give.
