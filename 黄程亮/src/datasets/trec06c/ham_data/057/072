Like Matt I am very grateful for DMDX. As a Research Fellow with a very
small budget, I cannot afford expensive software, or programmers' time.
DMDX makes it possible for me to pursue lines of experimentation that I
probably could not otherwise pursue. I like Matt's suggestion of a
documentation website- I would contribute to it, and would also be happy to
contribute to the task of compiling information from it.
