  Perhaps the easiest thing to do is to buy one of these button boxes,
making sure that it just has buttons and no extraneous signal condtitioning
circuitry, buy a cheap joystick or gamepad and wire the joystick/gamepad's
cable into the button box.  The joystick/gamepad approach requires no pull
up resistors, just match the connections up in the botton box the way the
joystick/gamepad was wired.  That way you don't have to mount switches in a
box, just a little soldering is all that is required.
