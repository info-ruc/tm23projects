Well, I haven't figured out what is wrong but I've worked around my serial
problems.
 
For the record it was mostly a problem of cables.  I was using a DB25 M to
F rs232 cable and that didn't seem to connect correctly.  I was using a
male to male adaptor, I don't know what if any effect that might have had.
 
But I noticed on Kam Leang's site he was using a DB9 to DB25 cable so I
tried one of those and it works perfectly.

The max232 chip still doesn't line up with the 2.3.3 testing tip but if it
works, then that's fine with me! ;)
  
Cheers,
