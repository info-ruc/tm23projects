How have people fared with standard joy sticks and game pads?  Any
recommendations here?

I imagine that a button box is very easy to build, especially if it is
simply passive circuitry (i.e. a button switch to transiently close a
circuit). If need be, I'll just go to Radio Shack and get the parts to make
my own, but I've been hoping to save the time.

cheers,

JK
