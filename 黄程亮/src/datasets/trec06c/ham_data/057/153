Can anyone please write me a brief servo motor program
that will control two servos from the expansion board?

This the one I had to control one, but did not work:

void main(void)
{
    while(1)
        {
                init_expbd_servos(1) 
                 servo0 = 1000
        }
  
     return(0);
}
