Hi,
We had very good luck in last years Trinity College contest with some cheap
IR Photo transistors.  We got some DIGI-KEY QSD422QT-ND photo transistors and
found they gave us very good discrimination even at 4 feet away (which was
the maximum range we cared about).  These units are almost black.  We tried
some of the clear Radio Shack photo transistors but they got spoofed by
variations in room lighting.  We set up an array of 5 of these on top of the
robot looking at different angles and they worked great.

Barry
