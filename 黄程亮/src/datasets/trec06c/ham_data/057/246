Subject: pcode for 20x4 LCD

I picked up the 20x4 LCD at bgmicro, and it works fine. I have pcode for 20x2
successfully running, simply by re-compiling with the LCD_COLS set to 20. Does
anyone have the mods required to support all 4 lines of the display? It looks
to be beyond my programming skills.

thanks,

Wayne
