I think that i can help you.
I do have the data sheets of the 'OPTREX DOT MATRIX LCD MODULE'
It contains 47 pages,but i can filter the most interesting ones out for
you,especially the ones on how to program the full 80 characters + the
definition of your own characters.

contact me at the following address:
ludo.soete@village.uunet.be
if you're interested for the info.

regards,
Ludo
