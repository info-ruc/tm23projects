COMPUTER SCIENCE SEMINAR SERIES

Applications of XML in UM Web Services

Wednesday, February 15th, 3:00pm
Weir Hall, Room 235

Presenter: Dr. Kathy Gates
Assistant Vice Chancellor for Information Technology, University of
Mississippi

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used widely in business settings
to describe and exchange data in a general-purpose way. More and
more
applications in higher education are making use of XML as well.
For
example, the interface that allows University of Mississippi (UM)
students to view and manage financial aid awards is based on an
XML
protocol between a web application server and the back-end financial
aid system. Likewise, the Postsecondary Electronic Standards Council
(see pesc.org) has published an XML-based standard for
exchanging
transcript data between institutions. This presentation will feature
the ways that XML is used in UM Online
Services
(https://secure.olemiss.edu/services) applications and the tools
that
Information Technology staff members have found to be
helpful.
