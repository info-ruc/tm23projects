Call For Extended Abstracts & Papers

Sessions on Internet Computing, Networking and CS/CompE Education

The 2006 World Congress in Computer Science, Computer Engineering,
and Applied Computing (WORLDCOMP'06)
June 26-29, 2006, Las Vegas, NV, USA
 =20

Dear Colleagues:
 =20
You are invited to submit an extended abstract or paper to various =
conferences and sessions
relating to internet computing, networking and CS/CompE Education. The =
world's largest gathering
of researchers in computer science, computer engineering and applied =
computing
will be held June 26-29, 2006 in Las Vegas. The 2006 World Congress in =
Computer Science,
Computer Engineering, and Applied Computing is a major annual research =
event.
It assembles a spectrum of affiliated research conferences into a =
coordinated
research meeting held in a common place at a common time.  You can submit =
extended
abstracts and papers to the following conferences (see the topic lists =
below):

The 2006 International Conference on Frontiers in=20
Education: Computer Science and Computer Engineering (FECS'06)

The 2006 International Conference on Internet Computing (ICOMP'06)

The 2006 International Conference on Wireless Networks (ICWN'06)

The 2006 International Conference on Communications in Computing (CIC'06)

SUBMISSION OF EXTENDED ABSTRACTS AND PAPERS:

Please regard this as general guidelines. Prospective authors are invited  =
to INITIALLY
submit their EXTENDED ABSTRACTS (about 2 to 3 pages - single
space, font size of 10 to 12) and PAPERS directly to V. A. Clincy =
(vclincy@kennesaw.edu).

Again, send your abstracts and papers DIRECTLY TO Vice Chair: V. A. Clincy =
at vclincy@kennesaw.edu=20

If you are interested in serving as a REVIEWER, please send a current vita =
directly
to V. A. Clincy at vclincy@kennesaw.edu=20

The regular deadline for submission is Feb. 20th with a notification-of-acc=
eptance (or denial) by March 20th.
E-mail submissions in MS document or PDF formats are preferable (Fax or =
postal
submissions are also acceptable.) The Vice Chair will forward the papers =
to respective
reviewers.

Extended abstracts and papers will be evaluated and fully refereed for =
originality, significance,
clarity, and soundness.  Each extended abstract or paper will be refereed =
by at least two researchers
in the topical area. The revised, full and final papers will be reviewed =
by one person.

If the extended abstract  is accepted, the full paper must be received by =
April 20, 2006
and must be in camera-ready form. The length of the camera-ready papers =
(if accepted)
will be limited to 7 (IEEE style) double-column pages.  Papers must not =
have been
previously published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere.  =
The first page
of the paper should include: title of the paper, name, affiliation, postal =
address,
e-mail address, telephone number,  Fax number for each author.  The first =
page
should also include the name of the author who will be presenting the =
paper (if accepted)
and a maximum of 5 keywords. Also, the name of the conference that the =
paper is
being submitted to must be mentioned on the first page.
