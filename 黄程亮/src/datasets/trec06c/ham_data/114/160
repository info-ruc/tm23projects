Ha!  I wasn't clear about the first question.  I actually wanted to ask =
whether <t 17> (1 tick) should be the smallest timeout, rather than <t =
0>.  If <t 0> indeed is the smallest, then the world is just wonderful! =
:-)

Thanks!!

    How would you have a number smaller than zero?

    I learned it from the DMDX Timing Notes that "If there is no next =
frame in an item DMDX simply displays that frame and moves on to the =
next item, regardless of any frame duration specification".  In my =
scripts, I didn't put a blank frame at the end of item 100, so there =
shouldn't be a timing difference due to different frame durations.  =
(A)-(C) below are extracted from 3 different scripts.  In (A) & (B), the =
duration of item 100 is 812.44 ms (49 ticks), while that in (C) is =
795.86ms (48 ticks).  Since I didn't use any delay keyword, is the =
one-tick difference simply the result of different ISI? =20


    If you're not using a fixed delay DMDX will take it's own sweet time =
to get the display up on the screen.
