   Right, you're not asking it schedule an item to be displayed in exactly 
40 ticks from the end of the last one.  And if DMDX is sitting around 
waiting for an RT for 2000ms it's certainly not going to be able to get 
around to displaying the next item in 40 ticks.

   Don't use <Delay> unless you need it.  If you do read the timing notes 
carefully:
