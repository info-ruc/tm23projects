            One Hop has similar ring-like structure as Chord. One Hop
maintains a routing table size of all the members to achieve lookup time =
of
one hop. In order to reduce bandwidth in the keep-alive messages, One =
Hop
uses a three-tier hierarchical structure to disseminate membership =
changes.
The circular identification space is divided into slices, and there is a
slice leader in each of them. Slices are partitioned into units with =
unit
leader in the middle of each unit. Slice leader aggregates all the =
membership
changes and periodically sends to other slice leader. Once the slice =
leader
receives the membership changes, it forwards the changes to all the unit
leaders in the slice. Finally unit leader will propagate the changes to =
the
successor and predecessor. The paper analyzes the bandwidth cost of the
system and reasons the systems can scale more than 10^5 nodes. However, =
with
the hierarchical structure, the leaders will have a higher load than =
other
nodes. Also, if the leader is attacked or malicious, a large potion of =
the
nodes will be affected.

            Instead of using hierarchical structure to disseminate =
membership
changes, Kelips uses gossip protocol instead. Kelips divides the
identification space into n^(1/2) affinity groups. A node is mapped to =
an
affinity group, and the node in the affinity group will have knowledge =
about
the location of files in the group. The membership changes is spread =
using
two-level gossiping scheme. Kelips average lookup time is also O(1). =
However,
it takes some times to propagate changes in the affinity group using =
