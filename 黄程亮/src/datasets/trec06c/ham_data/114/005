   Yeah, that's a different thing I suspect.  There the name is simply too 
long for the part to be displayed that's different from other files but the 
file is still actually selected correctly.  Alas I can't just simply tell 
that combo box to be right aligned as it's not a simple dialog box.  Seeing 
as almost every machine that has item files in My Documents winds up with 
this problem it's probably worth my while seeing if I can't make the text 
right aligned...
