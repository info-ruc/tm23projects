Certainly no one has sent a -5V pulse before, are you sure you don't mean 
5V pulse?  If it's a 5V pulse it relatively straight forward once you get 
the card setup and working as outlined in TimeDX's help:

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/timedxhpiotest.htm

The it's a matter of putting <id pio12> in the parameter line of a item 
file and using <o N> anytime you want to put word N on port C of the 
PIO.  If you want to use other ports there are other output devices, 
pio12output16 and 24:

To toggle bit 0 of port C on a 1 second time base the following item file 
would be used:

<id pio12> F60
0 <o 0> / <o 1> / <o 0> / <o 1> / <o 0> / <o 1> / <o 0> / <o 1> ;l

If you really want a -5V signal you'll have find a technician to set you up 
a circuit that takes the +5V pulse and makes it a -5V pulse.
