Hi,

Thanks for your previous e-mail about bernfrac.  I found your talk
today very interesting.  I have a couple of results whereby I can
calculate class numbers of cyclic cubic fields of prime conductor p
for primes p of the form p = (a^2 + 27)/4 and of the form p = (1 +
27*b^2)/4 if I can compute a couple of Bernoulli numbers.  In
particular, in the first case, the class number h is characterized by
the congruence

h \equiv -3/2 B_{r}/r B_{2*r}/(2*r) mod p where r is (p-1)/3

and in the second case,

h \equiv -1/18 B_{r}/r B_{2*r}/(2*r) mod p where r is (p-1)/3.

I have been toying with the idea of making a big table of class
numbers, but I am not very tech savvy and I have a lot to work on as
it is.

Also, I have been wondering if calculating the inverses of numbers mod
p would be any faster than the usual algorithm using the following
algorithm:
if you want the inverse of a mod p, run the Euclidean algorithm with
a*p + 1 and p^2 as your starting values instead of a and p.  The first
remainder you get that is less than p is the inverse of a mod p.  It
saves you the trouble of having to backtrack once you find that the
GCD of a,p is 1, but on the other hand, you have to make a comparison
of the remainder with p at each step.  The number of steps to reach
the inverse in my method can be shown to be the same as the number of
steps to reach the GCD when running the Euclidean algorithm with a and
p.  Of course, the original algorithm is so fast that I don't suppose
it matters.  I just think mine is charming, and a little mysterious.

Best Regards,
Barry
