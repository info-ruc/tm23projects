I've found the source of the problem, namely Microsoft, and their silly
"can't get rid of write-protection even though you right click to remove
projection" feature.  The solution is to copy the rtf file (and associated
experiment files) and put them into a fresh folder.    

Thanks for your help though, Andy.

   That's the first time I've ever heard of a problem like that.  Off the 
top of my head I'd say there would have to be some sort of add on software 
that's mucking up the windows file selection dialog.
