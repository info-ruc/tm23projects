CS352-ers,

A couple of announcements:

1) Alan Lee will be substitute lecturing on Tuesday Feb. 14 (so you 
won't get to see me on Valentine's day....:-(

2) We will not be accepting any late Homework #4 (the one that just 
went out) submissions after Monday Feb. 20, so that we can give you the 
HW #4 solution sets on Tuesday Feb. 21, in preparation for the first 
midterm.

3) After an in-class vote, the weekly review session will be remaining 
on Tuesday's at 4pm.  None of the proposed times were ideal, but this 
was the best of the bunch after all.

4) I will not be holding my regular office hours next week.  Instead I 
will be holding a special office hour on Wednesday, Feb 15 from 3-4pm.

My apologies regarding scheduling, but next week has two important 
events (1) a program committee meeting where I (and others) decide what 
papers are accepted for publication in a conference, and (2) one of the 
major computer architecture conferences is here in Austin next week.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
