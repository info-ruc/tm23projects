Hi,

I've got a problem with the following script.  The test I'm doing has three 
sections in each trial: a word problem, then replaced by a picture 
distractor, and then again the word problem for up to thirty seconds total. 
Subjects can solve the problem at any point, and my problem is that when 
they solve during either of the first two segments, the feedback is not 
immediately cleared -- instead, the trial keeps running and the stimuli 
stay on the screen until the words in the third segment flash very briefly. 
It's as if it only clears feedback upon the last segment.  (I'm using the 
<clfb> command.)

So, does anyone know how to immediately clear feedback even if a response 
is made in the first segment after the timer begins?
