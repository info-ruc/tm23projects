I have three questions regarding onscreen feedback. I am running an 
experiment where participants see the words which they have typed on the 
computer screen.

1. Many of the words that need to be typed have apostrophes in them (eg. 
I'm, you're). Currently my keyboard does not register the apostrophe key. I 
have tried adding it to the input using the <vzk> key but I get an error 
message saying that ' is not recognised on the input device. Is there any 
way to get DMDX to recognise this key?

2. Is it possible to change the onscreen text to lowercase letters instead 
of uppercase?

3. Which setting determines how long DMDX is open to a response? I want 
users to be able to type in a response for the duration of a soundfile. At 
the moment, the feedback disappears from the screen before the sound file 
has finished. My timeout is set to <t 12000>. If I increased this, would 
the response window also increase?

Best,

Rachel
