is a suite of services that libraries use to solicit, track,
understand, and act upon users&#8217; opinions of service quality. These
services are offered to the library community by the Association of
Research Libraries (ARL). The program&#8217;s centerpiece is a rigorously
tested Web-based survey bundled with training that helps libraries
assess and improve library services, change organizational culture, and
market the library.&nbsp; To date the survey has been translated into
numerous languages and has been successfully used in countries such as
Australia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, South Africa, and
Switzerland. These examples show that library assessment is a global
concept that unites libraries across borders.</font></p>
