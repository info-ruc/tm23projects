I'm having a problem with getting text to stay on the screen throughout multiple
trials. The issue: I want to play two sound files consecutively, with a pause in
between. I also want the instructions (including a rating scale) to stay on the
screen throughout these multiple trials.

This works fine if I don't insert a pause frame (/ <ms% 300> /) between the
sound files. When I do insert a pause, the screen is wiped when the pause
begins. Adding <fbocb> doesn't seem to help. There's nothing in the
documentation that I can find that addresses this issue.

I could add silence at the ends of the soundfiles, or create many single
soundfiles with two words and a pause built in, but I'm hoping there's a more
parsimonious solution.
