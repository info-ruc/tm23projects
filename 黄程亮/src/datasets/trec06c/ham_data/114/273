Hi All,

is there any way I can get DMDX to present pictures and sound simultaneously?? I
got it to present one after the other so to speak using:

+1*<wav 2>"test"/ <jpg> "barrel"/;
+2*<wav 2>"test2"/ <jpg> "watermelon"/;	

and 

+1*<jpg> "barrel"/ <wav 2>"test"/;
+2*<jpg> "watermelon"/ <wav 2>"test2"/ ;	



But with the first option, the sound begins before the picture is presented and
in the second option, the picture is present before the sound starts. So how
can I, if possible, get them to come on at the same time and for the picture to
remain on screen during the wav file?


While I'm here, I have another question regarding timing. The sound files are
all different lengths--will this affect the recorded reaction time? How can I
make sure that the lengths of the sound files don't confound my reaction time
recordings?


Thanks very much,


Carrie
