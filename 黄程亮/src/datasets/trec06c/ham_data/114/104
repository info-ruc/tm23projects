Dr. Loui

These are the notes I jotted down from talking with my dad.

As you can see there is definately enough there to make the document you
requested.

I'll refine it and have it for you ASAP.

Kick Return Team
Middle Return
5-4-2

2 – Return Backs:
The kick side returner receives the ball
They should call the ball
If the ball is kicked in the middle
The wall leader will still be one of the 2 inside guys
Someone has to step up (leadership quality?)
One of the backs has to call it (the fastest?)
If the kick is short
Watch for fumbles
Do what they can
Don't join the wall


4 – Wall Men:
Fall back into a wall
Take the first guy that comes and attacks the wall
Don't block him any direction
Follow the ball
Set up about 12-15 yards in front of the catch
When ball caught, leader says “Go” all move strait and pick up first guys in area
The leader is one of the two inside guys
The opposite inside guy of the kick side lines up with guy who catches ball
The guy who catches ball is the kick side 
The opposite return man joins the wall (making 5)
Wall goes forward and picks up first man that runs into them
Not a whole lot of communication – in our simulation they'll talk
Avoid double teams
Middle guy has the most 'freedom'
Blocks are inside->out to create gaps and seams
If the returner run past them
They are done
It's a mistake to try to keep blocking lest they get penalized
They don't block to the whistle
If they don't execute, the return generally fails
If the ball is short
The nearest wall-man picks up the ball
The rest of the wall attempts to set up in front of him
The will try to return it
Wall guys should block whoever comes
(big fumble risks)
Usually extra linemen

5 – Front Line:
First check for an on-side kick, make sure it is kicked
The middle guy drops 15-20 yards (always strait back)
He looks for the middle safety (probably the kicker)
Drop back, stop, go forward, watch back
If the runner gets through the wall
Proceed forward take the first guy he sees
Most likely this will be the safety for the the kick-squad
Usually the kicker
He will ignore everyone accept the the safety man

2 Guards and 2 Tackles
Do approximately the same thing
Make sure the ball is kicked
Drop about 20 yards
Toward the ball side
Inside-out leverage
Block the first guy that gets to them
They will try to block them to the outside
They will stick on that block to the whistle
Usually they're extra running backs or linebackers
If they miss someone, they try to get the next guy
If they miss everyone, try to pick up a block
They will try to get a block anywhere if they miss
Heat-seekers

Strait-Forward Kick-Off

9 7 5 3 1 0 2 4 6 8 A

0 – Kicker
Kicks the ball strait
Drift to the side of the ball
Drift about 10-15 yards direction of the ball
Avoids being blocked
Acts as a safety
Positions himself to be the last man to attempt a tackle

9 & A – End guys
Contain men
They run down the sidelines
They make sure the returner does not get outside of them
They will go to the very edge to either force the returner in or out of bounds
They play Outside-In
They try to run outside of blocks

1, 2, 5 & 6 – Wall busters
1 & 2 Inside
Attempt to blow the wall up from the inside
5 & 6 Outside
Attempt to bust wall from outside-in

They attempt to run through blocks
Don't take them on square (use a stunt, rip)
They do what it takes to get to the wall
Fastest guys
Make an attempt at a tackle if it presents itself
Blowing the wall is first priority
Tackle anyway possible
Wall busters should pursue to the ball carrier

3, 4, 7 & 8 – Coverage guys
Slower then wall busters
3 & 4
They'll track to the ball
They're responsible for the middle third around the “ball-line”
7 & 8
Also track to ball
Responsible for their respective outside third

They continue to the ball until the guy is tackled
If the ball gets buy them, they will attempt pursuit along a good angle

Reverse Kick-Return
2 - Return men:
Stay on their sides
One will catch the ball
They will cross
Either it will be a reverse hand-off or a fake
If the returner is running toward the side-wall side, the hand-off is faked
If the side-wall side is opposite of the direction the returner is running, they will hand-off
The back who does not catch the ball must always run behind the returner to avoid penalty
The back who ends up without the ball fakes the run on the off-side sideline

4 – Wall:
Depending on which way the return is called (left/right)
Opposite inside-guy is in the middle of the field
Opposite outside guy is slightly wide of him
Onside guy space themselves between the middle and the outside
The wall forms about 18 yards in from the middle (8 yards from the sideline)
The onside wall guys set themselves up about 6 yards in from the sideline (the outside guy is about 3 yards further up field)
The wall guys set up on a slant with the most outside ball-side guy being furthest forward
The most outside ball-side guy drops back about 5 yards
The next about 7 yards
They follow the same responsibilities as a normal kick at that point

5 – Front Line:
They form a side wall
The ball-side tackle attempts to knock-out the contain-man on that side
either get him out of bounds
Or pin him inside
He will track with the contain man
The other four guys will make a side wall
They run flat to the ball-side
Get about 8 yards from sideline
Run strait back and form wall
They are about 3 yards apart in the wall
They block whoever comes in area
They ignore defenders until the wall is formed
Can sneak in communication
