hello

I have a script (which I can send on request) for praat 
(www.praat.org)that takes
the files generated by dmdx and recalculates all speech onsets, which
can then be modified by hand. The output is a text file. I have always
found very high correlations between dmdx and praat even if the average
value is different (e.g. DMDX = 0.81 PRAAT + 232.81 ; R2 = 0.64).
