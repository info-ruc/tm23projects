Group 6: Soviet Challenge

General comments:  We already discussed the potential difficulty with PSSC
#1 in the current lab environment.  Make sure you know what you are getting
into with this one.  Also, no explanation is given for the use of the "Force
Feedback Motor & Driver" listed in Table 1.  If this is important, it should
be included in the PSSC.

Suggested re-write of PSSC:
1.	An ability to connect to TetriNET servers via 802.11b and
communicate with them using the TetriNET protocol.
2.	An ability to display game/status information on a graphics LCD.
3.	An ability to control game action using a Directional-Pad
(pushbutton array?).
4.	An ability to download and save (in non-volatile memory) game
configuration (e.g., game appearance and preferences).
5.	An ability to display battery "fuel gauge" (on LCD) and recharge
battery when connected to an "A.C. adapter".
