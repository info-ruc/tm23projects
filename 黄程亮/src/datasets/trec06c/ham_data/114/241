CS352-ers,

I wanted to remind you that midterm #1 is next Thursday, February 23.  
You are responsible for all material we have discussed in class thusfar 
including:

   - P&H chapter 1-5, 6.1-6.3 - including the assigned reading on the CD
   - Lectures and lecture notes
   - Homeworks

You may use the following during the exam:
  - A study sheet consisting of a single 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper with 
whatever you wish to write on it (but no photoreduction).
  - A non-programmable calculator.
  - Pen/pencil/eraser.
  - Your brain.

We will talk more about the exam on Tuesday.  I also expect to use part 
of Tuesday as a review session, so please bring particular questions 
you would like to have answered or discussed in class.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
