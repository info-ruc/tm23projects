ACM LAN Party : Feb 17th, 2006 starting at 5:00pm

The University of Mississippi Chapter of the Association for
Computing Machinery (ACM) will be having a LAN Party on
Friday, February 17th, 2006 at 5:00pm in the Adler Labs on
the second floor of Weir Hall.

The ACM is an excellent opportunity for Computer Science
students and computer enthusiasts to get to know the faculty
and each other.

We will be playing Quake 4, Halo, Half-Life 2,
Counter-Strike Source, Call of Duty 2, Warcraft 3, and
Starcraft. You don't have bring any hardware as the Adler
labs are being provided to the ACM for use for this LAN
Party. Don't forget to bring your headphones though!

ACM will be providing pizza and drinks at this event.
Non-ACM members need to bring $3; however, to join ACM the
membership fee is only $5 for the entire academic year. I
look forward to seeing you at the ACM LAN Party!

Thanking You,

Matthew Kooshad
(Vice President 2005-2006)
