Dear Anisotropy Group,

If you know of any students interested in an anisotropy project for an
MSc degree, please forward this email on to them.

Thanks,

HELP TO DEVELOP A NEW ERUPTION FORECASTING TOOL!!
Development of anisotropy monitoring at Mt. Ruapehu Volcano=20

We are looking for an MSc student to help in a funded project to develop
a new tool for eruption forecasting, at Mt. Ruapehu Volcano, New
Zealand.  The successful applicant will register for MSc by thesis at
Victoria University of Wellington (VUW).  The research will be
supervised by Associate Professor Martha Savage (VUW), Dr. Tony Hurst
and Dr. Steven Sherburn (both at GNS Science).
In two previous MSc projects, we have shown conclusively that seismic
anisotropy changes in direction by almost 90 degrees, over timescales of
at least several years around Mt. Ruapehu volcano.  We have proposed
that such changes are caused by changes in the state of stress around
the volcano, which cause the orientations of systems of microcracks to
change.   The MSc student will develop a quick, simple anisotropy
monitoring methodology, and use the methodology to compare anisotropy
changes since 2002 to other volcano monitoring techniques.

Funding received from the New Zealand Earthquake Commission will provide
the successful applicant with a 15-month stipend, and pay for VUW
enrolment at the domestic rate, which applies to students from New
Zealand, Australia, France, and Germany. Students of other nationalities
must pay additional fees, which are not met by this funding.=20

Interested students, who will ideally have a strong background in
geophysics, physics, or geology, should apply at the earliest
opportunity and by 31 March 2006 at the latest.
