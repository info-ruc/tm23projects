On 23 March 2006 AUT and NATFHE will be hosting an international development conference on the brain drain in African higher education. It will outline the findings of the project and discuss action points for trade unions, NGOs, universities and government.

Speakers include:
* Dr John Rowett, secretary general, Association of Commonwealth Universities
* Monique Fouilhoux, higher education coordinator, Education International
* Dr Alex Nunn, Leeds Metropolitan University and author of the AUT?NATFHE brain drain report
* Nick Sigler, head of international relations, Unison

Panel sessions include: 'Impacts in Africa' and 'Towards policy and action'.

If you wish to register or to receive a copy of the final programme, please e-mail Afshan Khan at NATFHE: akhan@natfhe.org.uk.

I also have two leaflets sent to me by the AUT, if anyone wants one.
