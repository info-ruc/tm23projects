From your scripts, you have the timing starting before the sound plays
in both cases. 
This is something we regularly use, but as you say in order to work out
exact timings you may need more information.
We commonly have a key word in a sentence, and need to know the reaction
time from that keyword to a button press.
The way we do this involves editing the sound file (we use Creative Wave
Studio) in order to find the exact millisecond time from the start to
the key word. Then of course that is subtracted from the DMDX recorded
time. 
If anyone knows an automatic way for DMDX to record times from a
specific point in a wave file, I'd love to know it !
