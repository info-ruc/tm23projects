I have a new email address!You can now email me at: lcs_ghana2@yahoo.co.in

My Good Friend,

Due to your honesty, I am convinced that you would be capable to provide me with a solution. I am Mr.Kofi Anyin of KA Legal Consultancy Services, Accra Ghana. I am writing on behalf of my late client Mrs. Andréa Eich, a British Citizen, a successful businesswoman base in Accra Ghana who died unfortunately with her family (Her Husband and two kids) in an air mishap in July 2000. 

I am contacting you simply to assist in claiming her deposited assets valued at US$30M before it gets confiscated by the Netherlands Bank. The Bank has written me as her consultant and issued a final notice to provide any of her relatives or have the assets channel to the Netherlands National Treasury as unclaimed fund within the next 5 working days. 

Since there was no relatives or next of kin left in our record, I seek your consent to present you as her only surviving relative, so that this funds can be paid to you. Therefore, on receipt of your _expression of interest (EOI),I have agreed that you will inherit 45% of this fund for your help and sincerity,45% for me while 10% for the refunds of processing expenses and to pay tax in your country(if any) upon successful confirmation of this funds in your bank account. Thereafter, all the related legal documents will be destroyed and we part ways. 

My aim is to usher you in legally as her relative (since I have been unsuccessful in locating her relatives) so that the fruit of her labour will not be in vain. All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Please urgently call if you can handle it. 

Best Regards,

Mr. Kofi Anyin
