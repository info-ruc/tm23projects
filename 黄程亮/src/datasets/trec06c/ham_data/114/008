   Yeah.  Apart from that being an extended style meaning that in order to 
do it properly I'd have to make my code handle another completely different 
dialog box template when I kludge it up it looks pretty weird as the drop

currently 90+ days since the last rain fell and that was like a hundredth 
of an inch.
