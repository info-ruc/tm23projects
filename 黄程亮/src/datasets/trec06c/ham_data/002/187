I am trying to get a Solboure series 4 500 sparcstation clone to be my 
cpu server.  The first time I tried to get it to boot plan 9, it refused
to load, saying that the entry point of the kernel conflicted with its
rom.  I attempted to relocate the kernel by changing the -T 0xE0004000
argument in the mk file to -T 0xFFFF0000.  Then, I can get it to start
to tftp its kernel, but then afer it rotates its / a few times, it
stops dead.

My personal theory is that more then just the -T in the link needs to
be changed, but I have no idea where the others are.  Is there a guide
to the kernel somwhere?

Specifics:
file server: a BSDI machine running u9fs.
rarp and tftp server: either a 386, or a nextstation running plan 9.
potential cpu server: a Solbourne series 4 500, with nothing on the SCSI
bus (it usualy runs unix, and I remove the drives "just in case" (it is
properly terminated))  One processor, 32megs of ram.  The console is a
vt200 on serial port A.  There is a framebuffer, but I can't use it.
(no monitor/keyboard)

Thanks in advance!
