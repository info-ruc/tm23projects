Hi,
is it possible to develop a application with .../ape/libg.a and pcc?

The following programm
	#define _LIBG_EXTENSION
	#define _POSIX_SOURCE
	#       include <stdio.h>
	#       include <libg.h>

	void ereshaped(Rectangle r ) { }

	endles(Bitmap * screen)
	{
  	      fprintf(stderr, "~~~~~\n");
 	       while ( ecanread(~0) ) fprintf(stderr, "ecanread\n");
	}

	void main(void)
	{
 	      binit(0,0, "local_label");
 	      einit(Ekeyboard|Emouse);
  	      endles( & screen );
	}
	
terminates in the in .../ape/libg.a(event.c:static void extract())

Is there anybody out there,
who can help?

Thanks for your help.

Hans-Peter
