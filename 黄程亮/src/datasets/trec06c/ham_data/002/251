Re: Electrical effects of dust storms

For those interested in electrical effects associated with dust storms, I
recently stumbled upon a  Masters Thesis entitled, "A Study of Certain
Atmospheric Electrical Phenomena Accompanying Sand Storms" by Charles E.
Houston.  This thesis was submitted to the Graduate School of Texas Tech.
University in 1932--during the infamous "Dustbowl."  Houston made
measurements of potential gradient during numerous sand storms in Lubbock,
Texas.  He states that "Actual measurements have shown that it is not unusual
for a vertical potential gradient of 2000 volts per meter to exist during a
sand storm."

This manuscript can be obtained from Texas Tech. University through
interlibrary loan.
