Sorry.  I guess I was being a bit vague.  I actually forget that plan9 is
available now to academic sites.

The bottom line is that as of March (possible Uniforum announcement), Plan 9
will be available to anyone with $499.95%, regardless of academic or
commercial affiliation.  There is a license involved, in that you, as an
individual, are free to use, modify and enhance the system. However, if you
want to resell it, or make money from it, you must talk to AT&T to
negotiate a special license.

The licensing terms are not completely defined yet, and I got the distinct
impression that that is one of the reasons it isn't available now.

Site versus individual license terms are also TBD.


% "$499.95" is not the price of the software.  All Rob had on his
   viewgraph slide was "<$500".  I assume the next few months will be spent
   hashing out pricing and licensing.
