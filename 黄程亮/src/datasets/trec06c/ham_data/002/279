Dear Wind_Erosion List Member:

I would like to welcome the new members to the list.  This list is only as
active as the list members wish it to be.  Please feel free to ask any
questions or start any discussions that you may find interesting.  Many times
questions are answered directly to the person making the request.  It might
be helpful to send answers to questions directly to the list so other members
might also benefit from your knowledge.  

If you are interested in reading past messages simply get a listing of the
archived files and read them.  To get a list of the archived files send the
following message {index wind_erosion} (without brackets) to
listproc@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu       
After you receive the list of archived files send the command:
{get wind_erosion 9504}        where 9504 is the name of the archived file.

Remember to send a message to the entire list membership you email to:
wind_erosion@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu

Cheers,
Ted Zobeck
