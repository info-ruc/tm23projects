reetings!

I've recently joined the list so, as Ted Zobeck suggested, I'm sending
this intoduction.

My main interest is soil erosion (wind, water) as affected by global
climate change. Up to now, my approach has been to run a site model (EPIC)
for 100 years at each of 100 sites in a region such as the US cornbelt, and
 to use a statistical framework to get regional means. I plan to move more
toward a spatially explicit (GIS) approach, mainly because I'd like to know
where the eroded soil goes, and how fast. This is part of a latger GIS
oriented project at this lab which is starting to focus on the Columbia
River Basin in the northwestern US. This involves steep, forested land as
well as rangelands and agricultural lands.

I'd be particularly interested in hearing from people (modellers,
experimentors) who are researching erosion and climate change; erosion on
steep or forested lands; or spatially explicit/GIS approaches to modelling
erosion.
