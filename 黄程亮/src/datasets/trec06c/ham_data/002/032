The other day, just for fun, I rebooted my file server while I was
still logged on to the terminal and cpu.  Very shortly they noticed
that the connection had timed out, and required rebooting themselves.
In a minimal configuration like this, that's not a big deal, but what
does one do in a larger configuration, with several cpu and file
servers?  NFS has lots of shortcomings, but its one good point is that
recovery is automatic.
