	failed.c:7 syntax in macro expansion: x

I don't understand why you keep beating on this.
The documentation states clearly that the C compilers
do not honor ANSI's standard for preprocessing.
It also says that if you want a real preprocessor,
use cpp, which is provided.

One reason is protest: the ANSI preprocessor
definition is needlessly baroque.  The real reason,
though, is simplification,  not only in the compiler,
but in the programs that result.  I could argue back
that making a variable have the same name as a
macro is bad style.  If you want to test whether the
letter of  the law is met by the preprocessor in the
C compiler, you're going to be disappointed.  If you'd
like a fast compiler that discourages tricky
preprocessing, you'll be happy.

As for us, we're happy.
