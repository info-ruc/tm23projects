re: computer networks and blowing dust

I asked J Stalcup, one of our computer network specialists at Texas Tech
University, about network problems during blowing dust events.  His
response is below.  Does anyone else know about such problems?  If a
connection can be made between blowing dust and networks, that would add
another economic justification for wind erosion research.


We have noticed that on occasion we have lost equipment for reasons that we
couldn't correlate to anything other than a dust storm.  My recollection is
that this occurred more in the past than of late ... but I haven't been
keeping records.   Networks cabled with copper can become very large
antennae should they not be properly grounded.  This makes them susceptable
to interference and damage from radio frequencies and static electricity.
With the advent of fiber optic networks, this problem is diminished.

Dust (and other atmospheric phenomenon) can cause problems for other 'line
of sight' transmission methods, such as, laser and radio links.  These
technologies are sometimes used in data networking to connect locations when
cabling is prohibitive.  Airborne dust can interrupt and/or degrade the
quality of the transmission to the point of being unusable.  As a result,
TTU doesn't not use this form of wireless communication technology for data
networking.
