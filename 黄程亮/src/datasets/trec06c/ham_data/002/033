The other day, just for fun, I rebooted my file server while I was
still logged on to the terminal and cpu.  Very shortly they noticed
that the connection had timed out, and required rebooting themselves.
In a minimal configuration like this, that's not a big deal, but what
does one do in a larger configuration, with several cpu and file
servers?  NFS has lots of shortcomings, but its one good point is that
recovery is automatic.

Brazil allows file systems to be mounted with a recover option
which does exactly what you ask. The recovery is entirely transparent
to the user.
