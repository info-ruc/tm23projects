Hi. I'm new to this list, and I found a few things in the archive
that I'd like to ask about.

Since auth(8) and cron(8) can run on a terminal, is there any way
to make the other daemons (for mail delivery and remote logins)
work on one?  Perhaps by building some sort of hybrid kernel?

The cpu server and terminal kernels are closely related, but what
is the difference between them? More than just the graphics driver I guess.

I only have 2 Magnums to work with, and I was planning to use one as a
terminal, and the other as a file server (with 2 interleaved 200Meg disks).
Would this be recommended, or does anyone have a 'better' idea?

What is Brazil? Is it available? Is it a third release of Plan 9?

Thanks,
