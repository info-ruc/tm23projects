Hello from the snowy northwest

I have just signed on the wind erosion discussion list and would like to 
introduce myself.

I am a research scientists working out of the Dept. of Biological Systems 
Engineering, Washington State University. My duties are directly geared to 
the USDA/ARS and US EPAs ' Columbia Plateau PM10/Wind Erosion Project'. This 
project involves several faculty of WSU, ARS scientists, U of Idaho faculty, 
and various segments of Ag coperative research. Our mission is to measure 
wind erosion and simultaneous PM10 emissions from agricultural fields on the 
Columbia Plateau and to model dust emission and transportation across the 
region. Products will be displayed in GIS format where high emission areas 
will be able to be identified.

My primary responsibilities involve field-scale measurements of wind 
erosion, PM10, and met data. To do this, we currently maintain 3 sites 
across the Plateau that consist of a full met station (5 wind speeds, 3 
temps, radiation, wind direction, etc.), 8 low-vol PM10 samplers (at 4 
heights over 3 towers), 2 high-vol PM10 samplers (Anderson), and 12 poles 
each with 5 dust samplers. All data are collected on a data logger, which 
also controls the equipment when an erosion event is occurring. 

I also am in charge of using our new portable wind tunnel to measure erosion 
and dust emissions. This tunnel (designed & built in Pullman) is used to 
gather erosion/emission data across the entire study area on as many soil 
types and field conditions as possible. Initial field use of the tunnel took 
place last August and results are promising.

The ultimate goal of my research is to develop an emission model for PM10 
that will be fed into the erosion/transport model for dispersion.

I am a geologist specializing in sedimentology and eolian mechanics. I also 
have done alot of work on climatic-eolian interactions on the Hanford Site. 
GIS has shown itself to be a critical component of this type of work. I am 
interested in hearing from anyone doing similar research utilizing GIS and 
climatic-eolian factors.

I am also interested in wind tunnel designs, high resolution data of 
coherent structures, roughness effects on such structures, and grain 
entrainment. Anyone out there?

Larry
