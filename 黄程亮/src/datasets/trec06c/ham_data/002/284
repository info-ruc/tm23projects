Dear collegues,

It is now 3 months ago that I sent my questionnaire about aeolian research 
facilities to more than 300 people (and institutes) all over the world. If 
anyone of you who wants to co-operate did not yet receive a copy, contact me 
right now.
I thusfar received about 40 responses. Not too much, but the great majority 
will yet response I hope. Some of you seem to be very well equipped, and 
others seem to be very poor... But not in scientific knowledge I'm sure.
Thanks to all those who already responded.
