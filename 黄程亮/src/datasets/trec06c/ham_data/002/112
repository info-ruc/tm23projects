Backtracking is something that occurs at runtime.  The article on static
analysis in the last issue of the Icon Analyst deal only with static
analysis -- that appears in programs, not how they are used.

Future issues of the Analyst will address dynamic analysis and show, for
example, how many times expressions are resumed to produce alternative
results.
