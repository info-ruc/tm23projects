Subject: New release of Eu2C, an EuLisp-> Compiler
Cc: kopp@gmdzi.gmd.de

Now we announce the release 94-07 of Eu2C, our EuLisp to C compiler.

What's new in eu2c-94-07
========================
1. New installation procedure relying on unix make.
2. Support of two compilation strategies:
- total compilation of an application including all the runtime modules
- total compilation of an application using a precompiled runtime system,
  eg. eulisp-level-0.
The former produces very efficient code but the compilation is very cpu-
intensive. The code produced by the second variant is a little bit less
efficient since optimization across the interface between application an
runtime system is not possible, but due to the precompiled runtime-system
the compilation process is much faster.
3. Threads are now supported.

Where to get eu2c-94-07?
========================
The sources and installation hints are located at
