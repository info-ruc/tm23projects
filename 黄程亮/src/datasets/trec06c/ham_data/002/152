A version is in alpha testing.  It passes the basic graphics test;
at present, I am looking into portability and interface issues.  It
was developed under Windows NT 3.1, and making those binaries run
comfortably under regular Windows 3.1, or building some 16-bit binaries,
is our necessary next step.
