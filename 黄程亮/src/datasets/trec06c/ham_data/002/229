It is a well-known fact (well known to Rob, anyway  (-: ) that Sun, the
so-called "Open Systems" company, is about as open as my anal orifice when it
comes to details about their hardware.  I mean, the nerve of some people,
trying to run a different O/S on the hardware they bought!  The funny thing
is that the PC, from that most noted of "Open Systems" companies IBM, ended
up becoming the most open platform there is.

(I'm allowed to say this, I worked for Sun for almost 5 years  (-: )

Anyway, you might try pointing your student to the NetBSD/Sun-3 port, since
it contains

/usr/src/sys/arch/sun3/dev/if_le.c
/usr/src/sys/arch/sun3/dev/if_le.h
/usr/src/sys/arch/sun3/dev/if_lereg.h
/usr/src/sys/arch/sun3/dev/if_le_subr.c
/usr/src/sys/arch/sun3/dev/if_le_subr.h

Tell him to go grovelling around on ftp.NetBSD.ORG and eventually he will
stumble across these ...
