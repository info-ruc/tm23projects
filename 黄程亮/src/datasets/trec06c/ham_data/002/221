Hi all,
	Our systems administrators have been working on the mailing
list recently, in order to repair some problems resulting from a
(mis)feature of majordomo.  The effect is this, that the subscription
address for the list is now solely 9fans-request@cse.psu.edu,
plan9-fans-request will no longer be supported.  Mail to plan9-fans@cse
will be aliased to 9fans, for backwards compatability.  Hopefully
nothing has seriously broken in this process, but I am given to
understand that a number of people who previously unsubscribed may find
themselves back on the list.  For this we apologise, and ask that
effected parties resend the unsubscribe message to 9fans-request.

	I asked about the reappearing message from Arizona, but it
remains mysterious, as does the actual content of the talk. :-)

	If there are any other problems please let me know.

-- Scott
