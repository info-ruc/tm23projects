                      SALTATION VIDEO

Dear Colleague,

During the 'Response of Eolian Processes to Global Change' Conference at
Zzyzx, California in March this year, I showed a video compiled from some
of our high-speed cine-films.  The films were taken by a group in the
Department of Engineering of Aberdeen University, Scotland, who are
interested in saltation collisions.  They show sand grains saltating over
a granular bed in a wind tunnel, and focus on their interaction with the
surface rather than looking at the trajectories.  Individual collisions are
seen because (i) the film is run at 3000 frames per second and (ii) the
number of saltating grains is less than found in natural conditions.

At the meeting several people expressed interest in the video as a teaching
aid.  I have therefore added a few graphics to explain modes of transport
and the experimental setup.

If you are interested in purchasing the video, it is available from me,

The cost in the USA and Canada is 40 pounds + 5-60 pounds post and packing
= 46-60 pounds (to be paid in pounds sterling to 'The University of
Aberdeen (Engineering Department)'.

Postage to other countries will be different and there may be tax in Europe
and the UK, but I will be happy to quote you the appropriate rate.

If possible, we would prefer the money upfront, but I know that this may be
difficult.

The video is very much an amateur production, so don't expect a polished
professional product!  It has been produced solely as a teaching aid, so
that students can see the saltation process in action.

I look forward to hearing from you if you are intested in the video.

Yours sincerely

Ann Rice
