Just out of curiosity, would anyone happen to know why programmability
was considered useful for a debugger (acid), but wasn't for an editor
(sam)?  Perhaps if I could impose on the authors to comment on this?
(I'm not trying to start a flame war or anything of the sort, I would
simply like a better understanding of the issues at hand.)  Thank you
very much.
