Hmm, I am currently running plan 9 on a generic 486 dx/33 no name clone 
with 4 megs of ram and 120 megs of hard disk while waiting for our PC's 
to come in.  Using a unix filesever to bootstrap, I now have a stand 
alone plan 9 system.  There are a couple of problems, I keep running out 
or ram (with a 20 meg swap partiontion), swap /dev/swap doesn't seem to 
do much for me.  The system is nice, but thats about it.

For the machine, disable shadow ram, and life will be much easier if you 
have a magnum to set up as a fileserver.  If you don't, you really need a 
unix system which can run u9fs, this makes life infintely easier when 
trying to copy over the files.  Other than that, I'll let Forsyth, Capel 
et al, handle this, they are much more familiar with this than I am.
