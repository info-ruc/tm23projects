Hello,

I have been 'lurking' on the list for a while and thought it was about 
time I introduce myself.

My name is John Tatarko.  I am with the USDA-ARS Wind Erosion Research 
Unit (sometimes known as The Wind Erosion Lab) in Manhattan, Kansas.

The Wind Erosion Research Unit is now participating in the development 
of a Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) which is a process based 
replacement for the Wind Erosion Equation.  As a member of the WEPS 
development team, I am in charge of the MAIN supervisory program of WEPS.  
The function of the MAIN program is to initialize the model, make calls 
to the submodels, and produce general outputs.  Another of my tasks is 
the testing and application of WEPS for croplands.  Last but not least, I 
am also involved in the development of the wind database and generator 
for WEPS.

Other research interests of mine include soil spatial variability, 
rangeland wind erosion, and GIS applications to wind erosion problems.  I 
will be more than happy to discuss any of the above topics with those 
wishing to do so.

I do not have any questions for the group but would like to take this 
opportunity to announce our World Wide Web and FTP sites.  We hope that 
these sites will allow for better information exchange and promote 
interest in wind erosion research.

The Web site contains, among other things, a short description of our 
Unit, staff, and research mission.  The site also contains a fairly 
extensive (and growing) digital photo archive of wind erosion and related 
photographs which can be viewed or downloaded.  There are also links to 
our FTP site and other related Web sites.  This site is under construction 
and hopefully will continue to grow.

The URL for this WWW site is:

         http://zingg.weru.ksu.edu/


The FTP site is envisioned to be our main venue for the distribution of 
the WEPS model after the initial release this summer.  It is also a source 
of some of the above materials for those without Web access.  Currently the 
FTP site contains the entire digital photo archive, lists of Unit 
publications, as well as a few programs such as a pin meter roughness 
program and a aggregate size distribution analysis program.

The FTP address is:

         ftp.weru.ksu.edu

If you have any questions regarding either of these sites please feel free 
to contact me.
