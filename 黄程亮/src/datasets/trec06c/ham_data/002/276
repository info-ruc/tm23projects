The news.announce.newgroups moderator has posted the Request For
Discussion for comp.os.plan9.  I've appended it below.  This is the first
part of the newsgroup creation procedure: the voting guidelines call for a
21-day "discussion" period after the RFD appears, and then a Call For
Votes on the proposal, which is when the voting begins.  The people who
run votes are still backlogged, though there's a good chance the backlog
will be gone in 21 days. 

I'll keep an eye on news.groups and try to answer any questions about, or
objections to, the RFD, and I'll keep the mailing list informed about any
developments. 

If you support the newsgroup proposal, then it would be a good thing to
post to that effect on news.groups! 

		       REQUEST FOR  DISCUSSION

Group name:   comp.os.plan9
Status:       moderated
Distribution: worldwide
Summary:      Discussion of the Plan 9 operating system.
Proposed by:  Jim Davis <jdavis@cs.arizona.edu>

This is a request for discussion (RFD) about creating a new moderated
Usenet newsgroup, comp.os.plan9.

This RFD will be cross-posted to
news.announce.newgroups,news.groups,comp.os.research,comp.os.misc, and
the Plan 9 mailing list <9fans@cse.psu.edu>. Please post any responses
to this message in news.groups; Follow-ups have been set accordingly.

CHARTER

comp.os.plan9 is a moderated newsgroup for discussion of the Plan 9
operating system from Bell Labs.  It's a forum to ask questions and
share information about installing, administering, and using Plan 9
systems.  The newsgroup will be bidirectionally gatewayed with the
Plan 9 mailing list <9fans@cse.psu.edu>

RATIONALE

Plan 9 is a computing system developed at the Computing Science
Research Center of AT&T Bell Laboratories.  First released in 1990,
Plan 9 contains many innovative ideas but is robust enough for
production use.  There is an active Plan 9 mailing list with several
hundred readers.

Past releases of Plan 9 could only be licensed by universities. The
next release will be available to anyone, and run on a wide range of
PCs.  This will make running Plan 9 an option for many Usenet readers.

A Plan 9 newsgroup would let Plan 9 users help each other, and let
anyone interested in current operating system practice learn about
Plan 9.

MODERATION POLICY

Icarus Sparry <ccsis@bath.ac.uk> has volunteered to be moderator; Tim
Goodwin <tim@pipex.net> has volunteered to be backup moderator.  Both
are participants on the Plan 9 mailing list.  Moderation is intended
to keep discussion on charter topics, which we hope will encourage the
Plan 9 developers to participate.
