Hi,
i have problems to comment a include-line in a
C source file.


	C_Test cat include.c
	#include <u.h>
	void main(void) {}

	C_Test kc -c include.c
ok
	
	C_Test cat ooh_include.c
	#include <u.h>                  /* failed       */
	void main(void) {}

	C_Test kc -c ooh_include.c
	ooh_include.c:1 syntax in #include
oops

-hp
