According to the statistics from Merit, there's at least some 9fs
traffic on the internet.  For March:

name	port packets bytes
9pfs    564  41350   4358750

If there's anyone who will admit to doing this, do they care
to discuss the results?  Was performance reasonable, compared
to AFS, say?  Any security worries?
