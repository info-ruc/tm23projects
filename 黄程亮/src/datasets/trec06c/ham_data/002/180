A new version of 9wm is now available.  This fixes most of the
bugs that have been reported.  (The major exception is that
multi-screen displays are still unsupported).  The problem
with popups of Open Look clients not appearing has been resolved.

The new version may be obtained by anonymous ftp from ftp.cs.su.oz.au,
in directory /usr/ftp/dhog/9wm.  Get patch1.Z if you already have
version 1.0, otherwise get 9wm-1.1.shar.Z.

Thanks to all the people who contributed bug reports and fixes.
