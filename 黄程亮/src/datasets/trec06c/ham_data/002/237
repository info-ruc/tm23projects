Hi Ted,

I saw your request about wind erosion in Israel. Apart from Haim Tsoar, who is
also a member of the wind_erosion list and who works in the Negev, you can try
to get further information from Dr. Zvi Offer who is temporarily working at 
the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Belgium) until 30 August 1995. You can 
contact him via my e-mail address.

Best regards,

Dirk Goossens
