Hi, 

I ported a JPEG decoder to plan9. It produces a 
dump pic file, with 3 channels. It works well with B/W screens, 
at least on ELCs. However, I'm having some problems to 
display these files on color screens. They look with a lot
of red and green.

To display them I did:

$ djpeg -pic file.jpg | fb/drop                # which looks awful
$ djpeg -pic file.jpg | fb/dither |  fb/drop   # which looks
											   a little better
$ djpeg -pic file.jpg | fb/quantize |  fb/drop # which looks awful too

It's interesting to note that fb/dither does a better job
that quantize even though the manual says the contrary.

Well, here are some questions:

1) Does plan9 graphics system do something with 24-bit pic files?
2) what does it do?
3) Does fb/gif2pic work in any site, specially plan9.att? It does
   not work in our site. It produces something similar to my pic files.
4) Is there a way to fix the pic files generated by gif2pic?

	Any comment would be appreciated, 

	Thanks

P.D.
If anyone wants this software, in spite of what I say before, 
feel free to mail me.
