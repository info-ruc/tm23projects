He didn't say it was impossible to live without backtracking once you have
seen the light, just difficult. I'm not sure what you mean by "lazy lists"
- I haven't heard that term before, but if I understand what you mean then
isn't using arrays/lists to hold intermediate results then returning to one
of those previous states to continue along another path also backtracking?
That's what I call it, but perhaps I am misusing the term.
