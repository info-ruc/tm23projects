Dear Sir/Madam
My name is Mrs. judy watson. I am a dying woman who has decided to donate =
what I have to you/ church. I am 59 years old and I was diagnosed for cancer =
for about 2 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband, who has =
left me everything he worked for.
I have been touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from my late =
husband to you for the good work of God, rather than allow my relatives to =
use my husband hard earned funds ungodly. Please pray that the good Lord =
forgive me my sins. I have asked God to forgive me and I believe he has =
because He is a merciful God. I will be going in for an operation in less =
than one hour.
I decided to WILL/donate the sum of $2,500,000 (two million five hundred =
thousand dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and also to help the =
motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the widows.
At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls right now due to the fact =
that my relatives are around me and my health status. I have adjusted my WILL =
and my lawyer is aware I have changed my will you and he will arrange the =
transfer of the funds from my account to you.
I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you abundantly, and =
please use the funds well and always extend the good work to others. Contact =
my lawyer (Barrister Donald Baker) with this specified email: =
donald2baker@netscape.net and tell him that I have WILLED ($2,500,000.00) to =
you and I have also notified him that I am WILLING that amount to you for a =
specific and good work. I know I don=92t know you but I have been directed to =
do this. Thanks and God bless.
NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until the =
task is accomplished as I don't want anything that will jeopardize my last =
wish. And Also I will be contacting with you by email as I don't want my =
relation or anybody to know because they are always around me.
Regards,
judy watson (Mrs)
