I think the problem with general use of backtracking is that, while
convenient, it's less efficient than improved algorithms are for any given
task.  (Compare recursive vs. nonrecursive algorithms as another example.)
Nevertheless, when it's needed (no readily available non-backtracking
algorithm available in a timely fashion) backtracking is very useful.
