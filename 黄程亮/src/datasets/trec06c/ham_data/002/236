Hi Ted,
Happy wind erosion monitoring (weather permitting)!

I do not have any direct information concerning wind erosion in Israel, 
but I may be able to put you in touch with someone who can help you.  I 
met Dr. Louis Berkofsky, Prof. Emeritus at The Jacob Blaustein Institute 
for Desert Research, Sede Boker, Israel and he could connect you with the 
right Israeli researchers (I think).  He is a very open and friendly 
person who would probably be glad to assist you.  His e-mail address is:

louis@vms.huji.ac.il

Cheers,
