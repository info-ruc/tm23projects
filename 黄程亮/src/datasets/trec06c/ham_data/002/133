Step 1.  Mount a RAD: recoverable RAM disk in the CD32.  My experience is that
when you cet HighCyl to about 49, you are able to fit a usable Workbench on it
and still use the CD32 to a useful extent.

Step 2.  Copy the LIBS: and C: dirs straight from the Workbench-equipped CD you
booted from.  The Commodore Demo CD is ideal, since it contains Workbench 3.1,
whereas most others use 3.0.
To save space, you could consider deleting some libraries you don't need
anyway, like LIBS/rexx#?.  Also, you can probably do without C/Edit and a
couple of others.

Step 3.  Create the following directories on RAD: : S, Prefs,
Prefs/Env-Archive, Prefs/Env-Archive/sys

Step 4.  Copy the settings you want from ENVARC:sys/ to
RAD:Prefs/Env-Archive/sys/  You can omit this step, but you'll be left with a
very boring, standard Workbench, which is probably off-centre on your screen,
which looks boring in blue and grey and has a whooping big mouse pointer.

Step 5.  Make a small startup-sequence in RAD:S/, like :

C:SetPatch <>NIL:

C:MakeDir <>NIL: RAM:T RAM:Clipboards RAM:ENV RAM:ENV/Sys
C:Copy <>NIL: ENVARC: RAM:ENV ALL NOREQ

C:Assign <>NIL: ENV: RAM:ENV
C:Assign <>NIL: T: RAM:T
C:Assign <>NIL: CLIPS: RAM:Clipboards

C:IPrefs
C:LoadWB
EndCLI <>NIL:


Step 6.  Remove the bootable CD from the drive and reboot the CD32.  It should
now boot from RAD: and leave you with a Workbench and about 1,2 MB RAM free. 
If you insert the AmiNet CD now, it works.


G'bye then,
