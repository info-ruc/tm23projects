 A couple of months ago I asked about backtraking and got about 3 
 answers.. One was neat example of  course scheduling. I can send it to 
 anyone interested (if the original programmer is not around...). 
 I still think that backtracking is not used and explained enough. It is 
 really a great trick! It is a rather important control structure, and, 
 when part of a language enriches the ways in which porblems are solved.
