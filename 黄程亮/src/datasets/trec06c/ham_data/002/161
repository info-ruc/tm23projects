Subject: MS-DOS Icon and Ctrl C

Just a quick thought/query.

Has anyone got a suggestion that would allow me to handle ^C keypresses
directly? I've putting together an interactive program that really could use
the ability to read ^C as input, do some stuff and then quit. Any suggestions
short of modifying the iconx source gratefully received.

Cheers,

Nic
