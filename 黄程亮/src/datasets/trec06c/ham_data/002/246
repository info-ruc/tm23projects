The recent post which discussed some of the economic effects of
blowing dust events was very much on track.  Some of this is
documented in a review article I have written which is currently
in press for the special eolian issue of Geomorphology.

Dust storms have a measurable and significant economic impact.
Dust events imperil travel by and degrade the engines of motor
vehicles (Khorshid and Navwar, 1991) and aircraft; in 1973, an
airliner force-landed during a Harmattan dust haze at Kano,
Nigeria, taking 183 lives (Adedokun et al., 1989), and in 1979, an
attempt by U.S. military helicopters to rescue hostages in  Iran
ended in failure when the low-flying craft broke down in a sand
and dust storm.  Dust storms cause line losses and can seriously
impede transmission of electrical power by high-voltage cables
(Bofah and Owosu, 1986; Vishwakarma and Rai, 1994), and disrupt
telecommunications over microwave links (Al- Rizzo et al., 1993;
Arsenyan, 1994).    Anecdotal field experience by colleagues who
have unsuccessfully attempted to use their cellular phones in a
dust storm also tends to confirm the attenuation of/ interference
with electromagnetic communications by dust storms.  In recent
years, I have conducted research at Owens (Dry) Lake, California,
one of the largest single sources of blowing dust in the Western
Hemisphere.  Some of the measurements taken ny other researchers
during a recent multinational multidisciplinary experiment there
(not yet published formally but expected to be submitted to
Journal of Geophysical Research and/or presented at a special
session at the next AGU meeting) show extremely strong electrical
fields produced within the dust cloud, which would easily account
for some of the reported problems.  The dust plumes from the
desiccated playa cause a significant impact on a U.S. military
facility downwind; the base is shut down a number of  days every
year because of dust affecting visibility and telecommunications
and remote sensing on the base, and for every day the facility is
nonoperational millions of dollars in economic losses for "down
time" are incurred.
