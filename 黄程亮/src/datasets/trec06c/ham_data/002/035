Brazil is the name of the research version on Plan 9 we are currently
working on.

This has nothing to do with the plan 9 kernel. The errstr is produced by
whatever file system you are connected to. However, while the file
system could be modified to do this it does not seem unreasonable
to expect the application programmer to print adequate information
especially with the werrstr library function and %r format.
