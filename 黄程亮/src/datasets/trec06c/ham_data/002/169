Greetings and Happy New Year!
The International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme, Global change & Terrestrial
Ecosystems (IGPB-GCTE) has just released a call for scientists to join their
Soil Erosion Network.  Members of the Network contribute models and/or data
for International sharing.  They have a specific data and model sharing
policy of which members are expected to abide.  A short description of the
Network follows.  Please email Dr. John Ingram for specific forms and more
information at john.ingram@plant-sciences.oxford.ac.uk.
 
Cheers,
Ted

	Applying to join the GCTE Soil Erosion Network

Interested scientists who wish to join the GCTE Soil Erosion Network are
requested to apply to the GCTE Soil Erosion Working Group, through the GCTE
Focus 3 Office (address below).  The Soil Erosion Working Group is currently
chaired by Dr. Christian Valentin, and includes Dr. John Boardman, Dr. Arlin
Nicks, Prof Dr. Jean Peosen and Dr. Edward Skidmore. 


An application consists of two parts:

1.	A description of the work you wish to contribute to the Network.

	This should be submitted as descriptive data (metadata) for a soil erosion
model(s) and/or experimental and/or monitoring programme dataset(s), in the
standard GCTE format.  An example completed form for "models" and blank forms
can be sent as requested.  

2.	The signed application agreeing to abide by the terms as laid out in the
GCTE Data and Model Sharing Policy (will send info upon request). 

If the work is accepted by the GCTE Soil Erosion Working Group as being both
relevant to the Network or of high quality, the Focus 3 Office forwards a
summary of your metadata, together with a brief statement from the Working
Group chairman of its value to the Network, to the GCTE Scientific Steering
Committee for final consideration as a component of the GCTE Soil Erosion
Network.  Upon ratification by the GCTE SSC, your research would then
formally contribute to the GCTE Core Research programme. 


Please send your application to the GCTE Focus 3 Associate Office, at the
address below.
