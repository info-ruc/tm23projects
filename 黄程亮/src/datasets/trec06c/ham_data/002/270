Daniel:  Frank Larney forwarded your email to me since we have
some activity with remote sensing.    Your thoughts on using
remote sensing to detect dust plumes didn't mention the
possibility of radar.  While the radar satellites will not have
hourly coverage (more likely 16 days) there is a possiblity that
they could be useful if the cloud cover and the satellite pass
occurred at the same time.  I believe that there has been work
to actually estimate wind speed using radar.  This can be done
by linking surface roughness of water bodies to wind speed.

Your email points out some of the limitations that remote
sensing has when applied to agriculture, namely resolution,
repeatability and cloud cover.
