What version are you using? ^C functionality seemed to change after
version 8.5. So if you're using V8.10 or V9.0 try going back to V8.5
and see if that does it. If you're 8.5 or earlier, try a later version.
In DOS there is also BREAK ON and BREAK OFF which seem to control the
way ^C is passed to a program. I have a password program that has to
stay at V8.5 because of this.
