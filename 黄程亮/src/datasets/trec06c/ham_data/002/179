[I am talking about libXg but I assume the same applies to plan9 libg]

I can use estart() to register a file descriptor with the libg library,
but I don't see a way to *remove* a file descriptor.

Suppose my program wishes to add fd==4, and then the channel on fd #4
is closed. A subsequent open returns fd==4 again. Will/can the file
descriptor be re-registered?

Does libg handle this case?
