I've been beating my head on this for a while, but without much success.
Has anyone gotten u9fs to compile on an HP700 machine?  The server
responds to the nop, but then errors out (from the log file):

u9fs
kill 14404
>> Tnop
<< Rnop
u9fs: bad convM2S type
unix error: Error 0

Thanks in advance,

ja.
