Dear List Members,
	Hi, my name is Stephanie Gerson.  I am doing a report on 
overgrazing for my science class.  Since you are experts on overgrazing, 
I would really appreciate it if you could write bavk and send me some 
ideas on how to obtain information.  How is overgrazing related to wind 
erosion?  Do you know of any arcticles or books I should review?  Are 
there any addresses I should weite to?Thank you very much!!  Have a nice 
day.

				Sincerely,
				   Stephanie Gerson
