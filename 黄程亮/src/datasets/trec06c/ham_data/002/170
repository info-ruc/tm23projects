HELP!
I am looking for information on how to identify and quantify airborne
particlutes in lake sediment in a semi-arid region. Sedigraph results show a
bimodal distribution, largest mode in presumed runoff-borne clays, and
a very weak mode, during historic droughty periods, in the silt fraction.
The silt fraction is never more than ~5% of the total. How can I test if the
silt mode is aeolian? Please help!
