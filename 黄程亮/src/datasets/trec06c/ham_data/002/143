The Icon newsgroup is on the comp.lang hierarchy, indicating 
to the initiated that is is about a _programming language_.

Not surprisingly, this programming language is called "Icon". Icon
is a magnificent programming language, but representing GIF images 
as Icon source is, although certainly possible in principle, not the 
most obvious use of the language.
