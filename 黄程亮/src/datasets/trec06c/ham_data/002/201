Rob Pike spoke here Monday about Brazil -- you can see an abstract of his
talk if you point your web browser at
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/tics.  The main points that I recall were
dropping streams and replacing it with a simpler queued io system, because
that's faster and the flexibility of pushing streams modules wasn't being
used in practice, and changing the way video display worked so that you
can send images directly to the frame buffer, bypassing the window
manager.  Also Brazil uses the concurrent language Alef.  He's a very good
speaker and you shouldn't miss a chance to hear him.
