*************************************************************************************************

The following message will be broadcast periodically to inform new members of
the commands used in this list.  I apologize to those who may have already
received this notice.

**************************************************************************************************

I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the new subscribers to the
wind erosion discussion list - WIND_EROSION.  This is an unmoderated
discussion session open to anyone with sufficient interest and an e-mail
address.  Please feel free to discuss any aspect of wind erosion science (or
even tangental topics) as you see fit.  Ask that burning question and start a
conversation!  
     I would like to encourage you to introduce yourself when you first
become active in a discussion.  My name is Ted M. Zobeck, PhD.  I am a soil
scientist (wind erosion) with the United States Department of Agriculture,
Agriculutral Research Service.  My interests are wind erosion
prediction/modeling, prediction of temporal and spatial changes in surface
soil properties, and application of wind erosion science to global change
research.  I am located in Lubbock, Texas, an area that experiences
relatively frequent wind erosion events.  
    Now for a little housekeeping.  You may be interested in the command
syntax for a few common listproc commands.  The following commands may be
sent to listproc@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu:
    'set wind_erosion mail ack'  your message is sent back to you after it is
sent to others
    'set wind_erosion mail noack'  message not sent back to you
    'set wind_erosion mail postpone'  messages not sent to you until mode
changed again (ie use when you go on vacation).
    'set wind_erosion mail digest' your message is not sent back to you.  New
messages are not sent to you as they arrive, but accumulated into digests
that are periodically sent to you.
    'recipients wind_erosion' get a listing of all non-concealed people
subscribed.
    'index wind_erosion'  get a listing of archived messages
    'get wind_erosion (archive name)'  get a copy of the archive named.

Two ways to remove yourself from the list:
   'unsubscribe wind_erosion' or 'signoff wind_erosion'

Remember, these commands only work on listproc@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu.  General
discussion that will be sent to all members of the list should be sent to
wind_erosion@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu.   Any questions, comments, or problems can
be addressed to the list manager, Ted Zobeck at tzobeck@lubbock.ars.ag.gov. 

Please share the subscription information with anyone that may be interested
in joining the fun.  I look forward to many open, active discussions. 
Remember that we have or will soon have members from all continents so please
keep the slang and abbreviations to a minimum.

Cheers,
Ted
