***********************************************
I'm sending you information about our Global Change Master
Directory (GCMD) information system, a metadata service directing
users to Earth Science/Global Change research data.

My primary responsibility is to populate the system with descriptions
of earth science datasets available to researchers. If you or your
colleagues are interested in listing data sets in the GCMD or could
direct me to someone who has important data that should be known to the
community, please contact me. The following few paragraphs will give
you an overview of the system and access procedures. At your time,
take a few minutes to read and feel free to try a session or two.
Good luck in your research!

                The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)

The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) project originates from NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Global Change Data Center in
Greenbelt, Maryland.  A multidisciplinary database, the GCMD contains
nearly 3000 data set descriptions of national and international remote
sensing, in situ, and ground observational data. The U.S. contributors
include NASA, NOAA, USGS, DOE, NBS, EPA, NSF, NCAR, and universities,
while international holdings from Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Europe,
Africa, Russia, Japan, and Australia are represented.  The
descriptions provide information such as geographic and temporal
coverage, spacecraft/sensor, investigator, data contact, storage
medium, parameters measured and derived, discipline, location,
summary, and data quality. Some descriptions are provided with an
automated connection to an external system for more detailed
information, browsing, and data ordering capabilities.

The GCMD hosts a 'home page' on the World Wide Web (WWW) featuring
direct-querying via controlled fields and free-text Wide Area
Information System (WAIS) searches of the GCMD, GCMD News, lists of
data sources, and GCMD Documentation.  The home page also provides
access to the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites' (CEOS)
International Directory Network (IDN), comprised of nodes in North
America (NASA/GSFC), Europe (European Space Agency Earthnet Programme
Office (ESA/EPO)), and Japan (National Space Development Agency
(NASDA) Earth Observation Center).  The construction and maintenance
of the GCMD home page and underlying hypertext links is a
high-priority activity of the GCMD staff, with new information added
weekly and monthly.

The GCMD home page can be accessed using WWW browsers such as Mosaic
or MacWeb and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address
http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/. Mosaic and MacWeb provide 'Forms'
capability whereby users can submit queries directly to the GCMD
database from the home page. The GCMD client can also be accessed via
telnet gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov. and login as 'gcdir'. The client will
recognize your workstation and give you the X-window or ASCII
interface.

To access the NASA/GSFC node via modem, set to 8 bits, no parity, 1
stop bit, dial (301) 286-4000 (9600 baud) or (301) 286-9000 (2400
baud), Enter number: SISC, CALL COMPLETE <CR>, Username: YOUR NAME,
Local: c gcmd, login: gcdir

To access the European node, NSI/DECnet > $Set Host 29628, USERNAME:
ESAPID or INTERNET > $TELNET 192.106.252.160, USERNAME: ESAPID
*The CNES node is operational with X-Window and can be reached via ESA
node*

To access the Japanese node, NSI/DECnet > $Set Host 41950, USERNAME:
NASDADIR or INTERNET > $TELNET 133.56.72.1, USERNAME: NASDADIR
