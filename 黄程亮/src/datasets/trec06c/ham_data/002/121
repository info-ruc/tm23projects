Subject: SGML Parser ?

Hi all,

I was wondering if anyone has greated a validating SGML parser with Icon
and would be willing to share the source code.

If not is there some good samples kicking around that I could use to learn
from and then apply that knowledge towards creating an SGML parser.

Thank You for your time,

Chris
