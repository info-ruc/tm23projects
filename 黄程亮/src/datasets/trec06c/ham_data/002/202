> are penn and teller doing the television adverts for it?

Yes - I can see it now. Shot of someone staring in horror at a pile
of software packaging including Netware, Windows 3.1/3.11/
95/NT/(whatever it is called this week), OS/2, SunOS, Solaris, NFS,
X11r6, Emacs; cut to Penn and Teller who chorus "Don't try this at
home". It'd be better than their Persil advert anyway.
