Subject: Where is icon-mode.el for Emacs?

A recent post suggested that an Icon mode file for Emacs could be
found at ftp.cs.arizona.edu in directory icon/contrib/emacs.  I looked
there and found only icon-describe.el and cognate files.

So is there somewhere I can get the Lisp code for editing Icon programs
under Emacs?
