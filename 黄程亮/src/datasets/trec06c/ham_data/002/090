We are doing an Icon 9.0 on the Mac here at UT San Antonio, and while our
main emphasis is on adding the graphics features, we will certainly also
be providing all the other Icon 9.0 improvements such as the preprocessor.
Our implementation is presently in alpha testing.  We don't have the
resources to orchestrate a separate non-graphics release, sorry.

ProIcon uses various proprietary code that can never be released.  Some of
the features in it are non-proprietary and might make it into other Mac
versions of Icon at some point.
