Hi again,

Could someone out there give me some info about the latest Windows & Mac
port of Icon (version, etc).

Also is the graphics library being ported to these to platforms ?

Will they be wrappers around the given operating systems APIs so that the
Icon code will be portable ?

Thanks,

Chris
