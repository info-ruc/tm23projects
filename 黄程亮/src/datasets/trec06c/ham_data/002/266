Hello wind erosion netters!  We have been having quite a spring here in west
Texas (Lubbock).  Yesterday the wind was out of the east/southeast at about
25-30 mph but we had very little dust.  The relative humidity was 66%.  At
about 15:00 hours a front blew through bringing a thunderstorm with a little
rain, hail and gustnadoes.   Then a huge dust cloud blew in from the west. 
By 18:00 the humidity was 13% and the wind speed was 30mph, gusting to about
40mph.  Needless to say, a very intense dust storm was produced.  What a day!

Oh yes, the reason I contacted you was to request some information.  I am
interested in the contribution of wind erosion to the PM-10 (particles less
than 10um aerodynamic diameter) load in the atmosphere.  Is anyone else
working or interested in this area at this time?  I am aware of the project
in the Columbia plateau.  Are there others out there?  Are there any papers
reported in this this area?
Thanks for any information you might provide.
