This
   procedure main(arg)
      writes( "Input a char: " )
      c := getche();
      write(); write( "c: ", image(c) )
   end
works for me, with Icon 8.8 for MS-DOS; both ^C & ^Break are echoed
as the charset's graphic for Ascii ^C, then the program continues.

Note that non-Ascii keystrokes like Alt-whatever will generate 2
getch{,e}() returns, the first null; if you use getch{,e}() you'll
probably want to allow for that.

"Walking is a prescribed health activity, buddy.  If you go unsupervised,
 without a prescription, & then you get yourself in trouble, who gets
 the rap?  The city does.  So you got to have that prescription.  Did you
 know that almost all auto damage involving auto-pedestrian accidents
 results from non-prescription walking?"
