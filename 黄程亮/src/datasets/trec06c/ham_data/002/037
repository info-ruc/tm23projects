I agree.  I want to do even better and print (or at least read) messages
that say which component caused the error.  As you say, that requires
the fileservers to follow some convention for communicating the information
back.  I was imagining hacking the print routines to clip off the 
proposed trailing :number and return it in some other % verb, but even 
without that it would be an improvement just to see the raw information.

(I mistakenly used perror in the example before.  I really was thinking 
about the %r format, but my fingers are more used to typing the other.)
