Hi, Prof. Griswold,

I am using Icon to develop a collection of tools called the Web
Construction Set. Icon is proving to be very useful for the task at hand,
but I am having some trouble using pipes. It does not appear to be
possible to open a full-duplex pipe between processes. This is sort of a
pain, because I will then be forced to use files to communicate results
between processes. One of the goals of WCS is to generate pages without
using intermediate files on the Web server.

Thanks for any suggestions on how to proceed.

-George
