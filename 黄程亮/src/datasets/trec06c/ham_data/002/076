Subject: A question about a fighter who stabs himself
Date: 6 Aug 1994 21:44:57 -0700
Keywords: tavern,fighter,dagger


This situation came up at our gaming session this weekend...

A fighter walks into a tavern.  He is feeling randy and wants to impress the
ladies.  He pulls out his dagger and stabs himself repeatedly.  If the fighter
is 10th level, has a 17 CON, a girdle of fire giant strength, a normal dagger
and a ring of regeneration - how many rounds (on the average) would it take
for him to kill himself?

What if it were a vampiric ring of regeneration (we don't know if it is...)

   You can disbatch a helpless opponent in one round.  If he's not resisting
himself ;->, he can cut himself to ribbons in one minute/round.

   By the by, on any of my boards, the bar staff would likely get a touch
upset with this, they'd toss the body out of sight. In the 100 minutes ( -10hp
to 1hp at a rate of one hit point per 10 minute round ) it would take him to
regain conscinous (<-possible spelling error alert), the local theif/theives
would likely find him and steal all his pretty jewelry/coin/stuff.  If it
happened in the first ten minutes, he'd stay DEAD.

  If its a vampiric ring, since you only get back HALF of the hit points you
inflict, he'd die in one round, AND STAY DEAD.

Concievably this fighter could go on for a long time...after all you 
don't HAVE to use all of your strength to cut yourself.  So if we ignore 
strength bonuses, a dagger has an average damage of 2.5 HP/round, and the 
ring can regenerate (hmm, forget is it 1 or 3 HP/round?).  Anyway, you 
get the idea...of course if stupid accidentally pierces himself through 
the heart, diaphragm, throat, etc we're talking dead fighter.

One. Stabs his dagger into his throat and is probably dead or dying. Stabbing
the dagger into his heart would work as well (especially with that girdle).
No, no rules for it, that I could quote -- just common sense...

> What if it were a vampiric ring of regeneration (we don't know if it is...)

I still believe that the massive damage by a direct strike to neck, throat,
heart or something other vital would be more than enough to kill him 
(the ring just does not regenerate enough hitpoints).

Ciao,

Setting aside that fact that self-mutilation is probably a poor way to
impress women, I would rule it as follows:

Since hit points are are not taken to represent the sheer physical
capacity to take damage (it would be absurd that a human of *any* level
could take as much raw damage as a dragon), I treat the hit points
possessed at first level as the raw damage potential of characters.  Now,
although it is possible to give a mortal stroke to an unresisting
opponent, your fighter presumably does not intend to give himself
a mortal wound, but to show off his raw damage potential.  Hence,
figure damage as normal, but take it out of the hit points he had at
first level--you could figure it as doing maximum damage, but then it
wouldn't have the randomness which makes it, like Russian roulette,
a test of courage.  "Let's see . . . I have 10 hit points left, +7 to
damage, and a dagger which does 1-4 . . . ." 

In essence, if the character wants to show off, let him show off, but not
without _real_ risk.  Then you'll see how brave he *really* is (or how
stupid, whichever).

>What if it were a vampiric ring of regeneration (we don't know if it is...)

Well, vampires can't suck blood from themselves . . . I'd rule that a 
VRofR doesn't work with respect to self-inflicted wounds.

      Well, if the referee handled the matter of the fighter killing 
himself as a 'helpless opponent', then he could kill himself in 1 melee 
round.  Seeing that he was dead, I'd be highly surprised if the locals 
didn't then wander over -- removing the regen ring (when they saw he was 
healing) -- and loot his body.  :)

Using his full strength, once.  After 1 full attack he would be dead or dying.
You see AD&D claims that hit points aren't a measure of how much damage you
can sustain, but how much damage you can successfully AVOID.  It claimed that
people only have ABOUT 4 actual hit points and the rest are skill in avoidance,
deity favor, etc.  For this same reason you can KILL a sleeping person in ONE
blow, no damage need be rolled they are automatically dead.  It says that you
can kill one person a round in this manner.  So since the fighter is not 
avoiding the blow, one hit will make him dying or dead (use the damage roll
since natural instincts might prevent the AUTOMATIC kill from happening, but
don't give full hit points since he is not avoiding it (give him the standard
3-5)).

As always any opinions I may have written above are mine and mine alone.

Dave.

If I was a lady, I wouldn't be too impressed... ;-)

Heh... does he have to roll to hit?  ...and what if he misses, what will 
the ladies think?  :)

I'd like to say 1st that this wouldn't impress anyone (except at how stupid it
looks)

>for him to kill himself?

He can't.  A ring of regeneration will bring one back from the "dead" unless 
it was fire or acid damage that caused the wounds.  Not to mention (assuming
you're using the -10 rule) that the best he could hope to do is go unconcious
anyway.

>
>What if it were a vampiric ring of regeneration (we don't know if it is...)

Personally, I don't think that a ring of this type would work at all in the 
situation specified, so you can treat it as if he was wearing no regen
stuff at all.  (rough calculation says about 7 rounds)

You know, I almost want to know why...but...not really.
