I use goal-directed evaluation (backtracking) heavily, mostly to
implement predicates of the form ``there exists an X such that P(X).''
I occasionally find other uses.  I wish there were an equally nice way
to write ``forall'' predicates (I usually negate everything in sight
to get an ``exists'' predicate).
