Hello wind_erosion netters!  

Our lab is trying to relate wind erosion to PM-10 particles and we need
instrumentation to collect PM-10 samples in the field.   We are now using the
mini-vol sampler but would like to explore alternative technologies.   We
hope to find something smaller than the Anderson high-vol and are familiar
with the Cahill's drum sampler.  Are there any other instruments suitable for
ground-based field measurement of PM-10?  
I look forward to any replies.
