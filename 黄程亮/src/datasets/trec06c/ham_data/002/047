Jeffrey,

The University of Victoria has removed its ban on *all* alt.*
groups within Usenet News.  The order came from Dr. Sam Scully,
Vice-President Academic.  I am attempting to find out his
rationale for removing the ban, and I will mail you with
information as I receive it.

Please feel free to distribute this widely.
