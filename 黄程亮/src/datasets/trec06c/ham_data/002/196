Dear collegue,

The rapid evolution in the field of aeolian geo-sciences has led a number of
institutions to acquire highly technical facilities for conducting world
level
research in this area. I am attempting to compile an inventory of these major
facilities. If you would be involved in aeolian geomorphic, agricultural or
other geo-scientific research, I would be grateful if you could assist my
efforts by providing me with your name and adress so that I can send you a
detailed questionnaire. Your cooperation is highly appreciated.

Sincerely,

Dr. Dirk Goossens
Laboratory for Experimental Geomorphology
