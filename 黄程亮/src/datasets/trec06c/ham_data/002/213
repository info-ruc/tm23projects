Our colloquium schedule lists Rob Pike as the speaker on Monday, January
23rd, and his topic as "Brazil".  Point your web browsers at
http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/tics to see the abstract.  The talk is
scheduled to start at 10:00 am in room 701 of the Gould-Simpson building
at the University of Arizona; if you're in travelling distance but aren't
familiar with the campus then drop me a line.  Be advised that parking is,
um, that thing Mrs. Gingrich said to Connie Chung. 

Gee, everyone comes to speak in January, and not July... wonder why? :-)
