ProIcon can be ftp'd from ftp.cs.arizona:/icon/packages/macintosh/mep*.
Also available on diskettes for a nominal charge ($15, which includes
shipping to addresses in the US, Canada and Mexico.  $5 more covers
postage anywhere else on the planet).

If you'd like to receive the Icon Newsletter, published 3 times a year at
no cost to its subscribers, send us your postal mailing address.

The source code for ProIcon contains proprietary material, so we don't
expect that it will be released.  Source code for Icon itself is
in the public domain, and is also available via ftp, or on magnetic media.

The Icon Program Library is a compendium of useful and interesting
programs and procedures written in Icon, also available via ftp or
on magnetic media.
