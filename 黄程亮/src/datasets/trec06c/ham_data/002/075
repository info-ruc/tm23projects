Some time ago I posted a query asking if anyone out there had
integrated an expert system with a GIS (Geographical Information
System). I had quite a few replies - most unfortunately asking me to
forward on any responses as they were also interested. I'm now finally
posting a summary - very late as I have had to work on another
project this last month plus. 

Bob Coulson from the Knowledge Engineering Laboratory sent me his
paper "Computer-based planning, problem solving, and decision
making in forest health management: An implementation of the
knowledge system environment for the southern pine beetle,
ISPBEX-II" They have integrated in an object oriented framework,
CLIPS, Arc/Info, Oracle and a model written in C/Fortran.

Rick Sojda from USDI - National Biological Survey is at the conceptual
stage of a project to develop a DSS to assist wetland management on
national wildlife refuges. He has submitted a Works in Progress article
for AI Applications.

Ian Harrison of the AI Application Institute in Edinburgh informed
me that some students at the University had looked at using AI
techniques in co-operation with GIS systems, in particular CLIPS and
Arc/Info. I unfortunately haven't been able to obtain any more
information on this.

Michel Page from Universite Pierre Mendes-France, Grenoble has
developed a DSS tool called AMIA which models numeric and
qualitative knowledge. Two applications, long term energy/water
demand forecasting have been written. They are loosely coupling
AMIA with Smallworld to visualise the simulation results on maps.

Sean Skilton of CRC for Tropical Pest Management, Australia hopes to
integrate CLIPS, Arc/Info and C,C++,Fortran code to develop a
generic pest risk analysis package.

Erika Rogers of Clark Atlanta University is starting a project on
intelligent GIS (integrating verbal protocols of gis-users into
blackboard based gis assistant).

Beverly Smith from Aquired Intelligence informed me that one of her
clients had interfaced their product ACQUIRE with a GIS.

Clement Lee from the University of Hong Kong kindly forwarded me
a list of references - see end of post. These are oriented more at
remote sensing operations.

Adam Yeh of the University of Washington integrated Nexpert Object
with a GIS for electrical distribution planning applications. He also
enclosed a list of references, appended below.

Peter Veenstra from Edinburgh University is doing his Master's
project on a PC using Visual Basic to call CLIPS routines (and
IDRISI?)

Bob McKay of UNSW informed me the the CSIRO Division of Water
Research, Australia have implemented their own spatial reasoning
system, ARX, closely integrated with Arc/Info. I haven't been able to
get any further info.

Dan Hirst is doing a project combining CLIPS with a GIS.
