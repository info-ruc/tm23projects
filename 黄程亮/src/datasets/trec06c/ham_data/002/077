          BOBBIT VIRUS: Removes a vital part of your hard disk then 
          re- attaches it.  (But that part will never work again.)
          
          OPRAH WINFREY VIRUS:  Your 200 MB hard drive suddenly 
          shrinks to 80 MB, and then slowly expands back to 200 MB.

          paying too much for the AT&T virus.
          
          PAUL REVERE VIRUS:    This revolutionary virus does not 
          horse around.  It warns you of impending hard disk attack 
          --- once if by LAN, twice if by C:>.
          
          POLITICALLY CORRECT VIRUS:    Never calls itself a "virus",

          RIGHT TO LIFE VIRUS:  Won't allow you to delete a file,

          makes a lot of people really mad just thinking about it.
          
          FEDERAL BUREAUCRAT VIRUS:     Divides your hard disk into
