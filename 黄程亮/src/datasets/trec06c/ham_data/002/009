It could be me. 

I have a laptop (Compaq LTE/25e, 486, 200meg disk, 12meg mem) that I carried
with me from Sydney to Wisconsin (sabattical leave). I plug it into the 
ethernet here every now and then and mount a file system back in Sydney.
I also took it to the last IETF meeting in Seattle and did the same thing.

I've made a new kernal with SLIP support on a machine in Sydney and copied it 
across. Performance was acceptable but I can't compare it with other systems.

Bob.
