Greeting all!  It is March and time for the wind to blow in West Texas.  We
are prepared to sample aeolian sediment but since it is <5C and snowing we
will wait for a few days.

I have a question that I hope someone on the list might help me with.  Does
anyone know of the extent of wind erosion now occurring in Israel? I visited
there once but did not make it to the wind erosion-prone areas.   Thank you
in advance for any information you may provide.

Ciao,
