If the number of variables is fixed, you can extend the code (though it
starts getting uglier, fast):

procedure main()

   every (t1 := (0|1)) & (t2 := (0|1)) & (t3 := (0|1)) do {
      every writes(format( t1 | t2 | t3			# variables
                           "|" |			# separator
                           iand(t1,t2) | ior(t1,t2) |	# functions
			   ixor(t1,t2) | iand(t1, ior(t2,t3)) |
                           ior(iand(t1,t2),iand(t1,t3))
                  ))
      write()
      }

end

There are tricks lying around to generalize to the 'n'th case with generators,
but I've forgotten them!  I was hoping someone would take the solution
I mailed and generalize it... If I remember, the tricks were pretty ugly.
I think I'd just brute force, but maybe change the above formatting slightly
to:

   every (t1 := (0|1)) &
         (t2 := (0|1)) &
         (t3 := (0|1))
      do {...
