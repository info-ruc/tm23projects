Background Information
     This year's meeting theme is "Gateway to the Future".  Members of 
the American Society of Agronomy are dedicated to the conservation and
wise use of natural resources to produce food, feed, and fiber crops 
while maintaining or improving the environment.  For over 86 years,
agronomists throughout the world have recognized the American Society
of Agronomy as their professional home.  The Crop Science Society of 
America is comprised of scientists interested in all aspects of crop
science including the improvement, culture, management, and utilization
of field crops.  Members of the Soil Science Society of America focus
their interest upon soil physics, chemistry, microbiology, fertility, 
pedology, conservation, forest soils, mineralogy, and wetlands.
     These three Societies were established as independent, autonomous
organizations.  Because of their common interests, however, they work
closely together and share the same headquarters office in Madison, 
Wisconsin.  Total membership is 12,500.  Over 4,000 scientists from
throughout the world will attend the 1995 annual meetings in St. Louis.

To Present a Paper in St. Louis
     Society regulations require at least one author to hold membership
in the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, 
or Soil Science Society of America.  The deadline for registration of 
papers is April 8, 1995.  Additional program regulations are published 
in the Second Call for Papers.  The Second Call for Papers will be 
published in the Febuary 1995 issue of Agronomy News sent to all Society
members.  For non-members to receive a copy of the Second Call for 
Papers contact:

=========================================================================
Numerous Symposia are organized for each ASA-CSSA-SSSA Annual Meeting.
Those planned by the Software Scene for 1995 are listed below.

Software Scene:
1.  Global Networking and Databases.  Oral, Poster, and Computer
    demonstrations are invited on use of global computer networks 
    such as the Internet and use of agronomic databases
    available over such networks in agricultural research and 
    applications.  Contact Dr. Wendell Oak (303-282-2473) for
    more detailed information.  Joint with division A-5.
2.  Demonstrations of Internet Resources.  What agronomic 
    resources are available over the Internet?  The World Wide Web,
    Gopher, FTP, Telnet, Usenet Forums, EMail lists, etc. may be
    demonstrated and potential uses/applications in agricultural
    production and research.  Oral and poster presentations may 
    also be suitable.  Contact Dr. Tom Hodges (509-786-9207,
    thodges@beta.tricity.wsu.edu) for more detailed information.
    Joint with division A-1.

3.  Development of User Interfaces for Agronomic Models and other 
    Software Applications.  The user interface (appearance) of a
    software application has a large effect on the user's ability
    to use it easily and correctly.  Oral, Poster, and Computer
    demonstrations are invited on types of interfaces, principles of 
    design, interface development tools, and use of interfaces.
    Contact Dr. Dennis Timlin (301-504-6255, dtimlin@ncsr.arsusda.gov)
    for more detailed information.  Joint with division A-1.
