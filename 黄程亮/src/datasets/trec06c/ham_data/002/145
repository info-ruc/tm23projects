Subject: Help- Another Prob.?

Many thanks to all for responding to the problem that I was having with
the ICON Config file. I ran MAKE on both the compiler and interpeter and
everything seemed to go well until I received the following message:

xfmonitr.o Undefined Symbol
-profile Referenced from text segment
/root/icon/src/runtime

I'm using Linux...... and working with Icon V8.10

I found that I had an executable for both the compiler and interpeter
and when I ran the Make Test, everything looked OK. I also wrote a
couple of small Icon programs and tried both the compiler and
interpeter and everything worked as planned. Do I still have a problem?

Many Thanks, Have a great holiday

Bob Randall
