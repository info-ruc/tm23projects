You might want to consider just using the more commonly available metal=
 can IR
detectors.  I think they are even available at Radio Shack, and I think=
 DigiKey
sells them as well.  The pinouts are *not* the same, so you'll need to =
work out
some connector arrangement.

We've built 20 HandyBoards now here at MARS (Missouri Area Robotics Soc=
iety) in
St.
Louis; and the only part we've had trouble finding is the IS1U60.  I th=
ink the
IR
detector is more useful with a cable anyway, so why not just use the me=
tal can
version?

Later,
