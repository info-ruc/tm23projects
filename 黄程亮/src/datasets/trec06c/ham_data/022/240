Fred, or who every can answer this. I have implemented the smooth PWM routines
and are very happy with them. I notice now that there is a fix for the analog
sensor reading bug. One file that is replaced is the lib_hb.c file, which was
also the file that implememted the smooth PWM routines. If I replace that file,
will I lose the smooth PWM routine or does it have the new code in it. Or can I
just copy over a portion of it?

Also how are we doing on the expansion board. I am looking forward to using it. 

Thanks
