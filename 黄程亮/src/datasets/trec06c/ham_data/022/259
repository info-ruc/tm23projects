     Take a moment to look at your Handy Board.  There is a thick trace along
the top, right and bottom edge.  This is your regulated +5 line.  Now look
very closely at the outer edge of this trace.  It should be completely green
(covered with solder mask).  I discovered that on my board there is a small
portion of this trace exposed on the outer edge all the way around.  If yours
is like this, I recommend that you paint it all around with enamal paint.
This edge is most likely to find something grounded.
     I was doing an experiment with my board which involved monitoring the
NiCd battery voltage while cycling a motor.  I had the volt meter alligator
clipped to the stub of wire extending from the battery compartment.  While I
was removing the + lead, it brushed for a second onto this exposed +5 trace.
The very bright LED was my first clue of the problem.  The blank LCD was the
second clue.  the Pcode loader still says the board is working, and the LEDs
cycle properly,  but the LCD appears to be gone.  I'm still checking for other
problems.

Hope this can save some boards,
Pherd
