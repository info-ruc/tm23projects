Jeroen van der Vegt,

     Let me suggest some articles.  First "Sonars on the Cheap" by Keith Payea
page 20 of the Fall 1995 issue of The Robotics Practitioner.  This looks lie
about a $30 design.  Second "An Experimenter's Cheap Robotic Sonar System" by
Carl Motsinger page 89 of the April 1997 issue of Nuts & Volts.  Both of these
systems requier two I/O lines: an output that says "Ping" and an input that
says "echo."  The 6811 timer system is used to track the distance.  If you
really want to get fussy you can have other sensors that report temperature
and pressure to adjust the speed of sound used, but I think most people just
assume a value and use other sensors to adjust/refine important distance
measurements.

Hope this helps
Pherd
