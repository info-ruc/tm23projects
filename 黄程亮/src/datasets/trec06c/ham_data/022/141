Hi,
I've encounter some problem on using the stepper motor with my self-built
driver.  I am not using the driver in the HB. I have to build out a driver.
The driver chip I use is L298 and logic gate chip is L297 or 374( this chip
also use in HB) . When I connect the motor to it, there is vibration inside
the motor. However, the shaft of the motor is not turning at all. I suspect
that the step sequence is not correct. As a result. I found out that all
the step sequence are the same  for every clock pulse . According to the
theory, there should be a 4 step sequece with each sequence is being delay.


How should rectify this problem in order to cause the shaft of the motor to
rotate ?
Is it my input is incorrect ?

rgds,
phillip
