hi
At present I am up to section 4.4, "serial line and stop switch". 

I have  installed all the components as per the section but when testing by applying power 
and holding down the stop switch, the HB will not go into bootstrap mode. I have not 
connected the interface board yet.

Every thing else has tested ok up to this section, including getting 2MHz clock measured 
via an O/scope. 

On closer inspection of the electronic catalogs, I notice there are a number of 
configurations avaliable for resistor packs, ie RP4.

The two main rpacks seem to be all resistors commoned on one leg and brought out on a pin, 
or separate resistors moulded inside a rpack.

I have installed the commoned pin type.

Looking at the circuit diagram it appears the separate resistors is the configuration I 
require. Is this correct? 

thanks in advance
