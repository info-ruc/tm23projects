I don't really know how to explain finite state machines (FSMs) or parse 
trees...(I'm not in computer science...) but my artificial life class's 
homepage is still up and the text is available through it in post-script 
format (http://www.math.iastate.edu/danwell/math378.html).

To everyone that wants my "hard code" - I need to know what kind of 
sensors you're using and whether or not your environment is a set one. 
Also, my evolving code is much better at obstacle avoidance than the hard 
code. (It's not as hard as it may sound!)
