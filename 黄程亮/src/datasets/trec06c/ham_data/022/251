Not quite, but I made good use of the PWM to provide automatic,
feedback-adjusted motor control for straight-line tracking.  It might
give you some ideas.

My 'bot uses differential steering (it looks like a small wheelchair)
and used to cruise around the floor in large, sweeping arcs.  I put
odometers on each of the two drive wheels (using Hall-effect sensors and
magnet-imbedded Lego pulley wheels) so that the robot can make automatic
course corrections while under way.

Bill, I'm sending you the code under separate cover.  Anyone else who's
interested should send me a personal e-mail message and I'll reply with
the program.
