As I am new to this mailing list, I wondered if anyone could tell me if it
is possible to obtain expansion board pcb's, or is it still at the beta
testing stage. Looking at the web pages it seems to give several more
outputs/inputs.
Any more info on the progress of this board would be appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

Andy Burton.
