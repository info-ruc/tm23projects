Hello All,


my name is Marcelo Manjon and i am 5th year graduate student of
Mechatronics Engineering at Politechnic School of Sao Paulo University.
Turns out that this year i'll be developing a Micromouse Robot using the
MIT Handy Board. I have already developed my own Maze Solving Algorithm
in C++ Builder. However, i am trying to port it to Interactive C and i
am having lots of troubles. One of them is that in C++ Builder i've used
multidimensional arrays in order to represent all the cells of the
maze(8 x 8), as shown above:

int  cellMazeSouth[WIDTH][HEIGHT]
int cellMazeNorth[WIDTH][HEIGHT]
int cellMazeWest[WIDTH][HEIGHT]
int cellMazeEast[WIDTH][HEIGHT]

However, it seems that Interactive C does not support multidimensional
arrays. So, does anyone have any idea about how i am  supposed to port
it to Interactive C ?

Thank you in advance.

Best Regards,

Marcelo Manjon
