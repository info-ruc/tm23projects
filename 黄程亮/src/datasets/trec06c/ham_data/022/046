I connected a high powered hbridge board  to mine. I just used remove the
existing hbridge chip and connect the inputs to the chip to the hbridge board
made by Wirz. It works great.

               can someone please tell me if it is possible to connect
               external motor drivers (e.g a stepper motor driver) to the     
               handy-board? if so, how can one go about doing it? i 
               desperately need help as the dateline for my project is 
               drawing near, any help will be greatly appreciated, 
               thank you.

               thank you for your time.
