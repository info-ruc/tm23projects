Hi,
What is the current rating allow to be use on the HD if currently I am
using a stepper motor of rating 4.5V and current 3Amp ? Is it all right
directly plug it into the HB?

How should I increase the acceptable current rating on the HB? How Should
connect the L293B to have high rating? Is it safe ? How to be safe so that
it would not damage my HB ? To what I know, there is no build in diode in
the L293B ? Please advice 

rgds,
chia
