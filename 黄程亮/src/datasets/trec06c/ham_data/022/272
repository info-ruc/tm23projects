Can it be done? I'm using the Handyboard to control my hexapod robot and
weight is a problem. At the moment I have 8 AA batteries connected which are
not particularly weight light.

I'm not using any of the motor driving functions of the board, just the IR
receiver and portAbit7 for serial output. I could even live without the LCD
screen if I have to.

Anyone had any experience with this as far as how long it would run?

thanks
Adam
