Subject: using interupts from IC

I want to drive 3 stepper motors form a handy board. I have the code
running now as a dll under windows. What Im trying to gain from the HB is
using interupts, so I   can remain in connntact with the control while the
steps time  out- right now I just hang in a loop for the prescribed time.

What I need to do is output a pulse, then set an interupt.  When the
interupt occurs, Ill output the next step, and reset the interupt- it may
be for a different time period since I ramp up and down on the step rate.

while Im waiting for the interupt, I want to listen to a serial line for an
abort signal, and maybe output a count value so I can update a display on
the PC.

I think I know how to do this in assembler, but how about in IC?
