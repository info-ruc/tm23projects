	Sigh.  I can't forsee our Autonomous Robotics course buying
15 copies of IC 3.x or greater until it supports case/switch.  It's
the only feature that our students using freeware 2.81 really complain
that they miss.  #defines are nice, but global variables in ALL_CAPITALS
work just as well from a code maintenance standpoint; the other advanced
features (multi-dimensional arrays, advanced pointer stuff) just isn't
useful to our students.

	Could you please make adding case/switch a priority for IC 3.x
or greater?
