 does anyone know if the handy board's analog inputs can accept analog
 current output(4-20mA) from a photo-electric distance sensor? (e.g. the
 sensor might return 4mA if the object is 1 ft away and 15mA if it's 3 ft
 away) or can it only accept analog voltage output(0-5V).

 if the function 'int analog()' is used and the analog input is 2.5V, would
 the handy-board return a value of 127? i believe the range of values is
 from 0-255 for 0-5V. what if the analog input is current? 

 the distance sensor i'm going to buy comes with either a current or a 
 voltage output and i don't know which will suit the HB best. can anyone
 help? thanks in advance.
