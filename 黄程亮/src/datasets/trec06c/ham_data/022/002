Hey Tim: 
With regard to the VNC software I found it extremely helpful..I 
simply called up, John took over control of my machine and fixed the 
problem on the spot.  Saved both of us time so I think it is an 
excellent addition to CAS computing services tools.  Putting an 
icon on the start menu would also be great...especially for those of 
us who are relatively computer illiterate.  
Thanks 
Don

Howdy,

At some point this summer, you called our office (CAS Computing Services,
x4498) because of a problem with your computer.  The person from our
office offered to help by using/testing a remote control program (VNC). 
We have been testing VNC on a case-by-case basis because it enables us to
help people more quickly (saving you and us time).  It also enables us to
better understand what people are trying to describe on their screen
because we can actually see their screen.  This facilitates good
communication and, we hope, reduces additional frustration.

Earlier this year the CAS Computing Committee (www.cascss.unt.edu/cascc)
expressed some privacy concerns regarding the software and wanted to make
sure appropriate controls were put in place to prevent abuse.  Toward
that end, we put a warning in place when you start the program (if you
don't remember it, select "Start/Run..." and enter "k:\win\netinfo" and
select "Remote Control Agreement").  Instead of having people type in
that series of text to enable the remote control, we would prefer to put
an icon in the "Start" menu that did it for you.

What do you think of the software? Would you recommend its use in the
future?  Would you recommend its addition to the "Start" menu? Your
responses will be shared with CASCC committee members on or before 
September 8th.

Thanks for your time,
Tim.

Your staff has helped me several times this summer with this method.  
I think it's great!  It really expedited the help I received.  I 
would certainly use it in the future and would not object to 
including it in the start menu.

Thanks for asking, Karen

I have had a good experience with it; however, more often than not, 
someone from A&S has had to come over to my office to diagnose and 
fix the problem.

Setting up an icon with this command is fine by me, if we are still in
control of enabling or disabling it.
