	I called them this morning and ordered 6 Futaba S148 servos; they
had a 3-pack for <$40; with shipping, order total was $85.93.

	Nomenclature note:  I confused the guy on the phone by asking
about "servo motors"; to him, that meant the actual motor can inside
the black case.  In our class use, "servo motor" meant the entire
package: black case, gear, motor, wiring, etc.  The salesman's word
for this package was "servo".  I of course wanted the entire package,
not just the bare motor dissected out.

	Thanks for pointing me to Tower Hobbies!
