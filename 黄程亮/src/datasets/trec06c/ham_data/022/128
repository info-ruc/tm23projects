I posted earlier in the week about having a problem with the SRAM. I have
determined that there is not a problem with the SRAM on the handyboard. The
problem is that "main()" is not executing on reset like it is supposed to. The
program that I am using was working just fine. Reset the Handyboard and the
main() function would execute. I can excute from IC by just typing in main();
and it runs fine. The program does stay during a power down. I checked that by
hooking it up to the PC and did a list functions and main() was there. 

Any ideas
