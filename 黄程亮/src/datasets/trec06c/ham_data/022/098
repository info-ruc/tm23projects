It sounds like the SRAM is just fine.

Is your battery charged up???

If so, you may want to check out the battery backup circuit for the SRAM.  In the
HB assembly instructions there is a test to verify that the SRAM has voltage to it
even when the HB is switched off.  I would suggest rerunning that test.
