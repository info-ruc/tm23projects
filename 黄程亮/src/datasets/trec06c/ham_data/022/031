Well, conservation of energy says that there has to be some limit 
to that.  You should also remember that both fission and fusion
conserve nucleons (although beta decay and inverse beta decay may 
change a neutron into a proton and electron and neutrino, or vice 
versa).  So that puts an even more stringent limit on the amount
of energy you could get; no matter what happens, the energy tied
up in the nucleon's masses is never released, only the binding
energy holding them together.

One problem with a multi-element fusion reactor is that it takes
progressively higher temperatures and pressures to induce fusion
in heavier nuclei.  So the cost of fusing the heavier elements
may not be well offset by the additional energy provided.

Not at those speeds.  When you get up to fractions of light speed, gravity
manuvers need close apraoches to a black hole.

Ah My two concepts used a fuel launcher to boost the ship to speed without
internal fuel. or a maaser sail here to accelerate it to speed.  Both used
onboard fuel to decel it into the target starsystem, and used mined fuel to
accelerate it back toward Sol.  

Round trip time was about 25-30 years.

Actually combining fusion and fission is a total waste...

For all elements ligther than Iron (Fe) Fusion produces power and fision
costs power... Vice Versa for elements Heavier than Iron.

As for using some kinda multi-stage Fusion device I personnaly think that
it will both be MUCH simpler (from an engineering POV) and more efficient
to just use the fusion products (probably Helium) as reaction mass.

Just my 2c
