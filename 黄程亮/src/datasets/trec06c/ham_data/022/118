Rick,
I had the same problem. Also the compass would occassionally lock up and
require a reset. I tied the reset pin to a digital out and added a routine
to take all the necessary pins high and then cycle the reset pin. I reset on
initialization and could call the routine later it the compass locks.  I
have an assembler program that incorporates this. I use the V2X in slave
mode. I'd be happy to send it to you if it would help
