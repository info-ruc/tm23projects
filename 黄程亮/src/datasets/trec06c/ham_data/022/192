 Hi
    I have been trying to get the HB into bootstrap mode without much
    success. Following the instructions in the manual, I held down the
    STOP button while turning on the HB. The red and green LEDs were   
    supposed to turn on for a short period of time and then turn off     
    completely. However, no matter how much I try, the green LED remained 
    on (from the moment I connected the battery packs to the HB) and the
    red LED wasn't even on for this whole period. I'm really at my wits
    end now. Can someone help me out?

    Btw, I'm using using ICwin 3.1 . I have the MS-Dos version of 2.8 (i
    think) too.

 thanks,
 Edmund
 
 PS. what is the red PWR LED on the serial interface board for?
