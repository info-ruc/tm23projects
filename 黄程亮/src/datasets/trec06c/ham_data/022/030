Nels and Zach,

While the idea is doable (Project Dumbo, 1960 something) The output is far
below what we can achieve through other means. There is a lot of energy loss
to waste heat, etc.

Check the site I uploaded on AIMSTAR and antimatter catalyzed microfusion.

    Could you combine fusion and fision to produce a continous reaction?
