I am building my handyboard and have been unable to succesfully execute
testanalogs().     testmotors(); and testdigitals(); work but when i
testanalogs(); either the board displays the current position of the knob
(1-256) and freezes,  displays the heart in the corner and freezes or
displays nothing and freezes. when i say freeze i mean no logner respond
to the computer or the start/stop buttons. I have replaced every chip on
the board (except the main proccesor, the memory chip and the chip
soldered under the memory chip).This fixed the problems i was having with
the testmotors(). The knob I have is different from the pictures, it came
soldered when I bought it from the Robotstore in Hong Kong. 
Any assistance would be appreciated.
Sam
