I ended up doing the same thing.  I appreciate hearing that someone else had
thesame problem, and used the same solution.  It sure is frustrating that you
can't
trust the documentation that came with the compass; if you need to reset the
thing *AFTER* powerup than they should of put it in the documentation
&@&$%#)(&^%!

Thanks, I really do appreciate hearing a confirmation of the problem.

Later,
