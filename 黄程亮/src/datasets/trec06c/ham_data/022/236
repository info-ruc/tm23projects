hi,
How can i use my self build encoder to locate the position when my robot
reach a position ? Is it suitable to use a self build encoder together with
the stepper motor?

The self build encoder consists a photoelectric reflector sensor mounted
beside the rotating wheel. The side of the wheel is pasted with a segment
of 48 black and white colors . Hence , the sensor will only sense the white
segments and return the high pulse .

How should convert it to distance of the position I have travelled ?

rgds.
phillip
