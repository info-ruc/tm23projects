Edmund,

Typically the solution is to pass the 4-20 mA through a 250 ohm resistor
and measure the voltage across that resistor. As long as your A/D input
impedance is high, it can be ignored. A resistor is essentially a
current to voltage converter after all. You can use a 1% tolerance for
better accuracy. Keep in mind that you will never read zero because your
current never goes to zero. At 4 mA you will read one volt and at 20 mA
you will read 5 volt so now you have a 1-5 V transducer.

4-20mA ---------.----------- A/D +input
                /
                \ 250
                / ohm
                \
4-20mA return---.----------- A/D -input (ground)

Good Luck,
Dan
