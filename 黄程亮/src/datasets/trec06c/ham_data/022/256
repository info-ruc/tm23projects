Subject: My problems with digital outputs
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Dear Mr Fred Martin,

		My project requires digital outputs and does not need to have motor
outputs. I have also read your FAQ and one of them states that by adding
a hc374 IC chip in a similar fashoin to the one driving the motor
circuits, and connecting the chips timer to any 3 timer slots, I could
have 8 more digital outputs.

		Is it correct if :-
1)I directly connect 16 output pins to both the existing hc374 pins
driving the motor chips I would have 16 digital outputs.

2)And if I constructed another board with hc374 and connected it the
same fashion with the board's existing hc374, I would get 8 more digital
outputs(just asking, not greedy, curious).

And if it is correct, how then could I control the digital outputs with
the Interactive C++ program.

							Thank You...
