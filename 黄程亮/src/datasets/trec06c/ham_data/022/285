Hi.  I just wanted to pass this along to you for people's information.  I
was having segmentation faults when magic was trying to allocate 7 planes
of colormap.  My computer is running XWin32 and is in 16-bit color mode.
I enabled the selection "PseudoColor support in TrueColor Mode" in the
Colors menu of X-Win32 Utility and it seems to be happy.

Ben
