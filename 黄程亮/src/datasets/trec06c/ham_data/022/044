 hello to all
               can someone please tell me if it is possible to connect
               external motor drivers (e.g a stepper motor driver) to the     
               handy-board? if so, how can one go about doing it? i 
               desperately need help as the dateline for my project is 
               drawing near, any help will be greatly appreciated, 
               thank you.

               thank you for your time.

 cheers,
 Edmund
