	My previous source for Futaba (and compatible) servo motors, Images
Company of Staten Island, NY, tells me they can no longer get them unless
they're bundled with RC transceivers.  Anybody have another source for just
the servo motors?  I want 6 Futaba S148 (or equivalent).  I guess I should
limit the sources to "continental US".
