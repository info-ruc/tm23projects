LS.

I read something about the sonarboard.
Bill James did write to Jim about Jim finding a solution for some board.

I am interested in any solution to make my polaroid board work.
It doesn't even make a sound. It doesn't work at all.....??

I wonder why I see BJ writing J but I don't see a message from Jim ?
