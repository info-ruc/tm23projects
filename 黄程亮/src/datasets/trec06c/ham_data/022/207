Subject: Serial Communication with HP48 calculator

I am wanting to connect the SPI to the serial port of my HP 48 G
graphing calculator.  I have tried  Richard Drushel's serialio.c code
(thanks) and have had mixed results.  My calculator will work
intermittently with the HB.  I don't know anything about serial
communication and am just trying things I know little about.

Now, I have had great success using the digital 9 port and the 9600 baud
serial output drivers for the handy board routine posted on the HB Page
(thanks).  However, I must use the inverting version of the code (hmm...
I don't know why this is the case).  The serial output driver along with
a modified form (works with 9600 driver) of Richard Drushel's math.c
routines has allowed me to pass strings, integers, and floats to the
calculator.

Questions:

1.  Is there a version of the 9600 baud driver that supports input?

2.  Any suggestions that might help me use the serialio.c code and the
SPI?

3.  What is the difference between the inverting and non inverting
driver code?

Thanks in advance!
