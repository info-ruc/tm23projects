> 1.  Is there a version of the 9600 baud driver that supports input?

not that i am aware of.  you could connect to the HB's phone jack as
long as you don't have to talk to interactive c and your calc at the
same time.  see the FAQ serial answer.

the SPI is for high speed SYNCHRONOUS comms (data and clock line).
RS232 is ASYNCHRONOUS (data only).  SPI doesn't do RS-232.

the normal voltages of RS232 are -10v is logic 1, +10v is logic 0 (non
inverted, desktop levels).  the MAX232 chip on the HB's serial
interface card converts these into +5v logic 1, 0v logic 0 "TTL or
microprocessor level" voltages (inverted).

your calc apparently talks at the inverting, TTL level voltages -- it
would need a ckt like that on the HB's serial interface to talk to a
desktop computer.

thus, you can wire direct from the HB's phone jacks to your calc using
the SW drivers presented in the FAQ.
