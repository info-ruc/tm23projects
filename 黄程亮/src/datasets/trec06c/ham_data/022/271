There's many ways you can approach obstacle avoiding.

There are neural nets, evolutionary code (incl. genetic programming and 
genetic algorithms), finite state machines, and there's hard-coding it into 
the program (which, of course is no fun at all but such a headache saver!).

I have some code available, somewhere, that I can dig up - I have a 
hard-code version in IC, an evolving FSM code in C++, and a half-finished 
evolving parse tree in IC (note: use a more recent edition that has 
multi-dimensional arrays. so much easier). I don't know about the neural 
nets - I tend not to use them unless it's absolutely necessary (like in 
my new 3d tartaurus project). Though, one of the people I had a class 
with last spring has code for that using evolving neural nets, I believe.
