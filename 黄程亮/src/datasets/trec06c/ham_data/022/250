The OEM kit contains two transducers and two ranging circuit boards for
about a hundred bucks or so.  The designer kit contains only one each of
the above, plus an experimental demonstration board with a digital
display and driver circuitry, which would be cool only if you didn't
already have an HB, but is probably pretty useless for robotics
applications.  Specifically, the HB does all that the demo board does
and a lot more, so don't bother to get the designer kit.

Note that some outfits (like Wirz Electronics on the web) will sell you
a single transducer and ranging board for about fifty bucks, while
others (like the Mondotronics Robot Store) will try to gouge you for
$150 for a pair, so watch out!  I'd go with Wirz.  Buy one at first, and
then another only if you decide you like it.  Good luck and have a
blast.
