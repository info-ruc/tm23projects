Hi Philip,

are you shure, you have the right pins from the stepper to the outgoing p=
ins
from your chip. Have your stepper 4,5 or 6 cables?
If you exchange the cables, your stepper motor only do some vibrations or=
 doing
nothing.

The easiest way to test the sequence is the following (Stepper Motor with=
 5 or 6
Cables)
Most steppers with 6 Cables are using 2 for their voltage.

For example
Outgoing Pins form Chip

Step 1)
1 ---------- Stepper in 1
2 ---------- Stepper in 2
3 ---------- Stepper in 3
4 ---------- Stepper in 4

it doesn=B4t work then go to STEP 2

Step 2)
change Stepper in 1 with Stepper in 4    it doesn=B4t work go to STEP 3

Step 3)
change Stepper in 2 with Stepper in 3    it doesn=B4t work go to STEP 4

Step 4)
change Stepper in 3 with Stepper in 4    it doesn=B4t work you have a big=
 problem
:-)


I have test some steppermotors with an special mini-electronic (NE555 and
Stepper Chip SAA????)
With this equipment i test my Motorpins. It=B4s very easy and i have the =
correct
cable sequence.

cu and good luck
