Hi Nels,

Multistaged fusion all the way up to iron should be theoretically possible,
but the yield isn't spectacular more than a well chosen single stage:

Take:
( I)   1 (2H) + 2 (3He) -> 1 (4He) + 1 (1H) +  18.4 MeV
(II)  24 (2H) + 2 (3H)  -> 1 (54)Fe         + 401.4 MeV

24 (2H) means 24 atoms of Hydrogen, where the Hydrogen has atomic mass 2.

Reaction (I) is the most efficient single fusion reaction.
Reaction (II) is the short-circuit of the multi stage fusion.

The input mass of reaction (I) is 1*2 + 2*3 = 5
The input mass of reaction (II) is 24*2 + 2*3 = 54

So we can repeat reaction (I) 54/5=10.8 times before we've used the same
amount of mass as needed for reaction (II).

Doing reaction (I) 10.8 times will yield: 10.8*18.4=198.7 MeV

So fusing all the way to Iron has a yield (401.4/198.7)=2 times better than
fusing merely to light elements.

So, all the trouble (eg. higher fusion temperature, unwanted fusion
ractions) for a two times higher yield, is likely not worth it.

		       Titan 4 Explodes After Launch

	An Air Force Titan 4A booster exploded less than a minute
after liftoff early Wednesday, August 12, scattering debris into the
Atlantic Ocean off the coast from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

	The booster, carrying a classified military payload, exploded
42 seconds after its 7:30 am EDT (1130 UT) launch.  Debris from the
explosion fell into the Atlantic Ocean.  No injuries or damage were
reported.

	According to the Air Force, the Titan 4A began to
self-destruct 42 seconds into the flight.  Range safety officers,
charged with preventing the rocket from going off course and
threatening lives and property, destroyed the rocket two seconds
later.

	The force of the explosion was powerful enough to set off car
alarms in the city of Cocoa Beach, well south of the Cape Canaveral
launch site, the Associated Press reported.

	A toxic cloud of fumes from the Titan 4's propellant did form,
but drifted northeast away from land and dissipated, Florida Today
reported.  There was no danger to anyone from the cloud.

	The launch had been delayed by 90 minutes because of fueling
problems.

	While classified, analysts believe the booster was carrying a
signals intelligence satellites valued at up to $1 billion.  The
satellite, which would have gone into a geosynchronous orbit, would
have been capable of intercepting radio and other communications.  It
was similar to existing signals inteligence satellites.

	The Titan 4 explosion is the first for that rocket since a
launch explosion 5 years ago at Vandenberg Air Force Base, California. 
The explosion is the first launch accident at Cape Canaveral since a
Delta 2 exploded just a few seconds after launch in January 1997. 
That explosion caused damage to the launch site and nearby buildings,
but no injuries.

	The launch was the last Titan 4A launch planned.  The Air
Force will be using the upgraded Titan 4B, a more powerful booster,
for future missions.  The Titan 4B entered service last year and was
used to launch the Cassini mission to Saturn last October.



		    SOHO Spacecraft Condition Improves

	The health of the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)
spacecraft, which was out of contact with ground controllers for six
weeks, continues to improve, the European Space Agency reported
Tuesday, August 11.

	Engineers received the first on-board telemetry from SOHO over
the weekend, ESA reported, and were able to send SOHO commands
directing the spacecraft to transfer power generated by its solar
cells to its batteries.

	"This is the best news I've heard since we lost contact with
SOHO on 25 June," said Roger Bonnet, ESA science director.  "I never
gave up hope of some recovery of this fantastic mission.  We should
just hope that the damage sustained by SOHO's enforced period of deep
freeze does not affect the scientific payload too much."

	Ground controllers first detected signals from SOHO on August
3, the first time the spacecraft was heard from since it went out of
contact late June 24.  No telemetry was included with those signals,
but contact with SOHO over the weekend included information on the
voltages and temperatures of the instruments onboard the spacecraft.

	"I am truly satisfied with the information the data we
acquired gives us," said Francis Vanderbussche, in charge of the SOHO
recovery team. "Conditions on-board are as good as we expected them to
be".

	Ground controllers instructed SOHO to fully charge its onboard
batteries, so it can begin to thaw out its supply of hydrazine fuel
used for attitude control.  Once thawed, engineers hope to be able to
stabilize the slowly-spinning spacecraft.  They expect the batteries
to be fully charged later this week.

	NASA's Deep Space Network has declared a "Spacecraft
Emergency", giving 24-hours-a-day coverage of SOHO over other
missions, so engineers can continue to monitor SOHO's status.

	Contact was lost with SOHO on the evening of June 24. A
preliminary investigation indicates that a combination of errors in
preprogrammed ground sequences sent to SOHO, combined with the
decision by ground controllers to send a command to the spacecraft
after receiving "unexpected" telemetry readings.

	SOHO is a joint ESA/NASA mission to study the Sun from the
Earth-Sun L1 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers (900,000 miles)
Sunward of the Earth. It was launched in December 1995 and completed
its nominal two-year mission in April of this year. 



	     More Delays for the International Space Station?

	While NASA Administrator Dan Goldin told members of the House
Science Committee Wednesday, August 5, that the International Space
Station was on track for its first launches this fall, sources within
the space agency indicate that the station may be delayed yet again,
for up to six months.

	Acknowledging Russian funding shortfalls, Goldin said plans
were underway to modify the shuttle's maneuvering thrusters to allow
it reboost the station, a task originally planned for Russian
spacecraft, while a Clinton Administration budget official said
non-station shuttle flights might be cancelled to cover station cost
overruns.

	A number of reports, including public Internet postings from
people at or with contacts at NASA, have claimed that internal NASA
schedules have pushed back the launch of the first station elements to
April 1999, with the service module pushed back from April to
September or October of 1999.

	While Goldin made no mention of planned delays in the launch
schedule in Congressional testimony, he did mention the possibility of
future delays.  Noting the problems the Russian Space Agency (RSA) has
had getting money from the Russian government, he said, "NASA is
concerned that the shortfall in funding available to RSA places the
scheduled April 1999 launch date of the Russian Service Module at some
risk."

	If true, it would be yet another delay for the station, whose
first elements were originally planned for launch last fall.  Those
launches were delayed first to this summer, then to this November and
December, because of problems with the Russian Service Module.

	According to Goldin, the first station elements are ready for
launch as currently scheduled.  A Russian Proton booster is set to
launch the Zarya ("Sunrise") control module in November, followed by a
December launch of shuttle mission STS-88 to deliver the Unity docking
node.

	Goldin acknowledged other problems with the Russian space
program, including that production of Soyuz and Progress spacecraft
"has virtually ceased" because of a lack of parts.  Soyuz spacecraft
are scheduled to deliver some crews to the station and serve as a
lifeboat in the event of an emergency on the station, while unmanned
Progress vehicles would deliver supplies.

	The Progress vehicles would also periodically reboost the
station, whose orbit would be gradually lowered by drag from the
tenuous atmosphere is passed through.  Goldin said plans are underway
to modify the shuttles' maneuvering thrusters to reboost the station,
reducing the need for Progress spacecraft.

	Jacob Lew, the new director of the Office of Management and
Budget (OMB), told committee members that the Clinton Administration
would first seek to cover space station cost overruns from other
sections of the NASA budget related to human space flight, rather than
other science and research programs.  "We will look for offsets first
from within the $6 billion spent annually in the Human Space Flight
account, as long as they do not compromise Shuttle safety," Lew said.

	Such a decision would imply that shuttle flights unrelated to
the station could be cancelled.  While most shuttle launches during
the ISS assembly period are dedicated to the station, a small number
-- mostly involving the orbiter Columbia, which is too heavy to loft
space station components -- will be dedicated to microgravity, remote
sensing, and other missions, including reservicing visits to the
Hubble Space Telescope.

	Member of the committee were skeptical such a plan could work. 
"I don't believe you can get the money you need by canceling shuttle
flights or continuing to raid the shuttle budget," Rep. Dave Weldon
(R-FL) said.

	Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) was more blunt.  "After hearing
your review of these costs, I wonder what planet you've been on."



		      Soyuz Launches Mir Relief Crew

	A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying a replacement crew for the
Mir space station, as well as a visiting former bureaucrat, lifted off
early Thursday, August 13.

	Soyuz TM-28 lifted off at 5:43 am EDT (0943 UT) from the
Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.  The launch proceeded normally and
the Soyuz is scheduled to dock with Mir on Saturday, August 15.  An
unmanned Progress cargo spacecraft undocked with Mir on August 12 to
allow the Soyuz to dock with Mir.

	On board the Soyuz are two cosmonauts, commander Gennady
Padalka and engineer Sergei Avdeyev, who will relieve the current Mir
crew of Talgat Musabayev and Nikolai Budarin, who have been on Mir for
six months.

	Also on board is Nikolai Baturin, a former aide to Russian
president Boris Yeltsin.  Baturin was originally named to the crew to
report on the status of Mir to Yeltsin, but since being removed from
his post earlier this year his post-mission plans are uncertain.

	Baturin will return to Earth with Musabayev and Budarin in
Soyuz TM-27, the Soyuz craft currently docked with Mir, after spending
12 days in space.

	The launch of TM-28 was scheduled for August 3, but was
delayed by ten days last month when power and water were shut down to
the Baikonur launch site.  Unpaid bills, caused by a lack of funding
from the Russian government, caused the utility shutdown.  This launch
was funded by credit extended from a Russian bank.

	Padalka and Avdeyev will be the next-to-last crew to fly Mir. 
A relief crew, likely to include one Russian cosmonaut and French and
Slovak guest cosmonauts, will fly to the station in early 1999.  One
or more members of that crew will stay on Mir until mid-1999, when the
station is abandoned and reenters the Earth's atmosphere.



			    *** Technology ***

	    Possible Antenna Problem with Mars Global Surveyor

	A potential problem with the extension mechanism of the
high-gain antenna on Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) may delay its
deployment next year by up to nine months, impacting the science data
returned by the spacecraft, NASA reported Monday, August 10.

	Engineers believe air bubbles may have formed in viscous fluid
in a damper that is used to cushion a spring used to deploy the
antenna, located at the end of a two-meter (6.6-foot) boom.  The
bubbles would keep the damper from working properly, pushing the boom
out at high speed before the damper would have any effect.  Such a
deployment could damage or disable the antenna.

	"To the best of our knowledge, we could deploy the antenna
boom without any adverse effect," said MGS project manager Glenn
Cunningham.  "However, the forces that the damper and boom would be
subjected to as a result of the bubble formation are close enough to
the maximum force that they are designed to withstand that we want to
take a cautious approach in evaluating the deployment."

	The antenna is in use now, folded up on the side of the
spacecraft.  The spacecraft must be turned in order for the antenna to
send and receive data, interrupting science observations.

	Engineers plan to deploy the antenna boom in March 1999, when
the spacecraft entered its final orbit after aerobraking.  The
deployed boom will allow the spacecraft to maintain contact with Earth
while continuing observations of Mars.

	MGS team members are now considering delaying the deployment
to after December 1999, when the Mars Polar Lander and Deep Space 2
land on Mars.  Deep Space 2, a small "hitchhiker" payload on the
lander, will penetrate into the Martian surface and rely on MGS as its
only communication link with Earth.

	If the antenna remains undeployed after March 1999, some
science data could not be returned because of the limited
communications with Earth.  A NASA statement said an estimated 40
percent of the original data would be returned in the first 30 days of
observations from its final mapping orbit if the antenna remained
undeployed.  That figure could be increased, though, through the use
of larger receiver antennae on Earth.

	No decision on antenna deployment will be made before February
1999, Cunningham said.  "We have not made any decisions yet, but we
want to take a conservative approach in order to protect the mission
as fully as possible," he said.

	The problem is not the first for MGS.  The aerobraking
procedure was delayed by damage to a hinge on one of its solar panels,
causing it to bend beyond its design limits during aerobraking passes
in the Martian upper atmosphere.  The problem was corrected by slowing
down the aerobraking, delaying the insertion of MGS into its mapping
orbit by one year to March 1999.



		 Japanese Docking Experiment Malfunctions

	The second experiment in automated rendezvous and docking
between two Japanese spacecraft failed Friday, August 7, and a second
attempt to bring the two spacecraft together failed a week later.

	The two sections of the Engineering Test Satellite VII (ETS-7)
separated early Friday morning, August 7.  The 2,540 kg (5,590 lbs.)
chaser satellite, named Hikoboshi, moved 525 meters (1,730 feet) from
the 410 kg (900 lbs.) target satellite, named Orihime.  The two
spacecraft then moved back together to redock.

	However, the two spacecraft apparently became misaligned as
they attempted to redock, and one of them entered a safe mode,
aborting the docking.  An attempt to redock the spacecraft later in
the day was foiled when Hikoboshi lost high-speed communications
contact temporarily.

	A second attempt to redock the two spacecraft took place
Thursday, August 13, but again failed.  A large attitude error in the
chaser spacecraft, caused by the inproper operation of the jet
thrusters on the spacecraft, was blamed for the failure, Japanese
engineers said.

	Engineers originally said the smaller Orihime satellite had
only enough power to last 72 hours while undocked from Hikoboshi. 
Hikoboshi provides power to both satellites while docked.  However,
both spacecraft seem to have enough power to continue redocking after
being separated over a week.

	The two spacecraft successfully undocked and redocked in July,
after separating by a distance of 2 meters (6.6 feet).  Future
experiments planned to redock the two spacecraft from separations as
large as 9 kilometers (5.6 miles).

	The spacecraft, launched last November, is designed to test
automated docking procedures for future use on the International Space
Station.  The names of the two ETS-7 spacecraft come from an old
Japanese tale, where the princess Orihime and her lover Hikoboshi were
allowed to meet only once a year.



		     Eight ORBCOMM Satellites Launched

	A Pegasus XL booster launched eight ORBCOMM communications
satellites into low-Earth orbit Sunday, August 2, bringing the global
messaging service system more than halfway to completion.

	The Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) Pegasus XL was dropped
from its L-1011 carrier aircraft at 12:24pm EDT (1624 UT) August 2,
while flying over the Atlantic Ocean east of Wallops Island, Virginia. 
OSC reported August 3 that all eight satellites launched by the
Pegasus appeared to be operating normally.

	The satellites, placed in an orbit 825 kilometers (510 miles)
above the Earth at an inclination of 45 degrees, join twelve others
previously launched.  The new satellites will undergo several months
of tests before going into commercial service, OSC said.

	Each satellite in the system weights about 40 kg (90 lbs.) and
has an eight-year lifetime.  When completed, the 36-satellite
constellation will provide a low-cost system for sending short
messages worldwide.  The addition of the eight satellites will
increase the total availability of the current system from 9 to 17
hours a day.

	The next group of eight ORBCOMM satellites will complete
factory testing over the next several weeks.  They are scheduled for
launch on a Pegasus XL off the West Coast in September.



	       Boeing, Air Force Test Space Maneuver Vehicle

	The U.S. Air Force and Boeing conducted the first flight test
August 11 in New Mexico of the X-40A, a prototype of a future reusable
Space Maneuver Vehicle.

	The X-40A was dropped from a helicopter at an altitude of
2,700 meters (9,000 feet).  A parachute deployed to stabilize the
vehicle, and was jettisoned once the vehicle was in stable flight. 
The X-40A then glided to a runway landing using satellite navigation.

	"I am very pleased with the results of this flight test," said
John Fuller, Boeing project manager.  "We wanted to validate low-speed
handling qualities and demonstrate autonomous approach and landing
capability. We did that today."

	The X-40A is a scale model of the Space Maneuver Vehicle
(SMV), a proposed reusable spacecraft that would deliver satellite
payloads, perform on-orbit reconnaissance, and other duties.  With a
wingspan of 3.6 meters (12 feet) and a fuselage length of 6.7 meters
(22 feet), the X-40A is 90 percent the size of the SMV.

	The SMV would be launched into orbit on another rocket, and
could stay in orbit for up to a year to perform its tasks.  It's
designed to then return to Earth, where it could be serviced and
launched again within 72 hours.

	Future tests will more fully explore how the X-40A and SMV
would fly in the air and in space.  "Our next step will be to
demonstrate the vehicle's capabilities, both in the atmosphere and
space," Fuller said.



			      *** Policy ***

		   Senate Approves Commercial Space Act

	The U.S. Senate approved late Thursday, July 30, legislation
that would open new opportunities for commercial launch firms in the
United States.

	The Commercial Space Act, H.R. 1702, was approved by unanimous
consent by the Senate.  The bill allows the Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) to license the launch and landing of reusable
launch vehicles.  Currently the FAA is limited to issuing launch
licenses.

	The bill also mandates the use of commercial launch services
for most government payloads, the purchase of space science data from
private companies, a study on the commercialization of the
International Space Station, and improved licensing regulations for
remote sensing satellites.

	The ability to issue launch and reentry licenses was seen by
many analysts as the key section of the bill.  With new reusable
launch vehicles being developed by private industry, such regulation
is critical to permit them to be launched from the United States.

	In one case, Kistler Aerospace, developer of the K-1 reusable
launch vehicle, has planned to launch from Australia instead of the
United States, thanks to a regulatory environment more conducive to
commercial space ventures.  Other launch firms have also considered
offshore launch sites.

	"Can you imagine the Wright Brothers flight at Kitty Hawk ever
being made if the government told them, `Sure you can fly it, just
don't land,'" said Sen. Bob Graham (D-FL), one of the leading supports
of the legislation.  "The way the law presently exists, commercial
companies can launch but cannot land any vehicle returning from space.
Only the U.S. government is allowed this privilege."

	"This is good news for America's commercial space
transportation industry, and for the long-term economic and national
security of this nation," said Charles Miller, president of ProSpace,
a grassroots lobbying group that supported H.R. 1702.  "We have been
fighting for this legislation for 4 years, and the U.S. Senate was the
last major hurdle."                          

	The bill was introduced in the House last year, and was
approved there in November.  The bill moved over to the Senate side,
where it was approved by the Commerce Committee in March.  A
conference committee will now iron out the differences between the
House and Senate versions.

	"I expect the House/Senate conference will be concluded
quickly this September, and that the President will sign it into law
this Fall," Miller said.



		     SEC Files Action Against SpaceDev

	The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced
Thursday, August 6, that it was requesting action against SpaceDev,
Inc., claiming the private space exploration company made "false and
misleading" statements to the public.

	SpaceDev, however, denied any wrongdoing and planned to
"vigorously contest" the planned SEC action.

	The SEC, in a request for a public hearing with an
administrative law judge, said the publicly-traded company made a
number of fraudulent statements, including claiming projected revenues
of $10 million and earnings of $2 million in 1998, without noting that
those numbers required NASA approval of specific projects.

	The SEC also said the company erroneously claimed it had a
deal with NASA for the use of the space agency's Deep Space Network to
communicate with SpaceDev's Near Earth Asteroid Prospector (NEAP)
spacecraft, scheduled for launch in 2000.

	Such administrative hearings usually take place within 60
days, Don Hurl, an official with the SEC's Denver office, told
SpaceViews, although legal maneuvering can often delay the hearing. 
No penalties would result from the hearing, Hurl said, as the SEC was
only seeking a cease-and-desist order to keep SpaceDev from making
claims that are not "accurate and complete."

	Of the about four hundred cases a year the SEC handles, Hurl
said, a "good number" involve false statements like the SEC's action
against SpaceDev.

	Dan Shea, director of the SEC's Denver office, told the
Associated Press that few investors were involved with SpaceDev. 
"Some people invested in this, but we caught it very quickly," he
said.

	The SEC declined to said how it became aware of SpaceDev's
claims, but Hurl told SpaceViews that the SEC generally gets its
information from a wide range of sources, including press releases and
information posted on the Internet.

	In a statement issued Friday, August 7, SpaceDev claimed no
wrongdoing and planned to fight the SEC.  "While the Company disagrees
with the views expressed by the SEC in its Order Instituting
Proceedings, the Company had attempted to resolve the issues raised by
the SEC through a settlement," the statement read.  "The Company now
intends to vigorously contest the SEC's allegations."

	SpaceDev president and founder Jim Benson told SpaceViews that
the SEC's action was comparable to "shooting at ants with an elephant
gun."  He said he was confident that the SEC's case would be
dismissed.

	"This is a legitimate, hardworking business," Benson told the
Associated Press.  "This is a serious effort and it's being taken

		      Government Suspends Sea Launch

	The U.S. State Department has suspended Boeing's license to
work with Russian and Ukrainian engineers on the Sea Launch project,
effectively bringing the project to a halt just months before its
first launch, the Washington Post reported Saturday, August 8.

	The suspension, which was issued July 27 but not publicly
announced, was issued because of lax security Boeing had in its
communications between American and Russian and Ukrainian engineers.

	The Post reported that a government official said the
suspension would be lifted once the government's security concerns are
met.  Russian and Ukrainian engineers working at Sea Launch's offices
in Long Beach, California, have left for home in the last few days
because of the suspension.

	The suspension comes at a time when American dealings with
foreign companies has come under intense scrutiny, stemming from
reports that Chinese officials obtained restricted technical
information from an American company in the aftermath of a 1996
explosion of a Chinese booster carrying an American satellite.

	The Post article said Boeing officials were ill-prepared to
deal with the restrictions required by the State Department on
communications with Russian and Ukrainian engineers.  Boeing might not
have been aware of some of the regulations, one industry executive
told the Post.

	A Boeing spokesman said the problems existed from the
inception of the project in 1995 through early 1997, when the company
brought in additional experts to deal with the flow of technical
information.

	The Sea Launch project is a multinational venture headed up by
Boeing to launch payloads from a portable launch site in the ocean. 
The Ukrainian company KB Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash provides the Zenit
booster and Russia's RSC Energia provides an upper stage for the
Zenit.  Norway's Kvaerner Maritime built the command ship and launch
platform, a converted oil-drilling rig.  Boeing serves as the "system
integrator" for the project.

	Sea Launch was slated to launch its first booster late this
year.  The launch will take place in on the Equator in the Pacific,
south of Hawaii.  Launches from the Equator get the maximum push from
the Earth's rotation, requiring less energy from the booster to reach
orbit.

		New Studies Cast Doubt on Mars Life Claims

	Several independent new studies published this week have added
their voices to the growing doubts that a Martian meteorite contains
evidence of past Martian life.

	The work, much of it published in the current issue of the
journal Meteoritics and Planetary Sciences, attacks the two-year-old
claims of Martian life in meteorite ALH 84001 on several fronts, from
the temperature of formation of the meteorite to the shapes of the
"nanofossils" seen within it.

	Researchers at the University of Hawaii reported that studies
of carbonate crystals seen in the meteorite show the carbonates formed
at high temperatures, not low ones as required for them to be a
product of biological processes.  

	Studies of various carbonate crystals under electron and
optical microscopes show the disk-shaped carbonates were squeezed in
and completely enclosed by rock.  This is consistent with their
formation from a hot liquid that passed through fissured in the rock,
and not with percolation of a low-temperature liquid through the rock.

	Another group at the University of Arkansas studied a number
of Martian and lunar meteorites under a scanning microscope.  They
found a number of structures in the lunar meteorites that were
indistinguishable from features claimed to be "nanofossils" in ALH
84001.  Since the Moon has likely been inhospitable to life throughout
its history, it casts doubt on claims that the Martian features as
fossils of tiny bacteria.

	Meanwhile, in a paper published in the August 14 issue of
Science, a team at the University of Massachusetts has found that a
chemical reaction used to explain the existence of microbes deep under
the Earth and possible on Mars is not feasible.

	Scientists had believed that the formation of hydrogen gas in
basalt deep underground could support microbes.  However, the
Massachusetts group found that hydrogen is not formed under those
conditions, depriving microbes of a key energy source.

	The studies are some of many recent assaults on the claim,
first announced in August 1996, that ALH 84001 contains evidence of
Mars life.  While the original team of scientists from NASA's Johnson
Space Center and Stanford University continue to believe their claims,
an increasing number of scientists are voicing their doubts.

	"The evidence against life in the Martian meteorite has been
steadily accumulating during the past year," said Ed Scott of the
Hawaii Institute of of Geophysics and Planetology.

	John Bradley, an adjunct professor at Georgia Tech who
published a separate paper arguing against life in ALH84001 last
month, was more blunt.  "I do not know of a single other individual
who believes it at this point," he said.

	Still, the announcement, even if incorrect, has focused the
attention of the planetary science community on the possibilities of
Martian life, and raised awareness in the nascent field of
astrobiology.  "More scientists than ever before are studying Martian
meteorites for clues to past conditions on Mars," said Scott.

	The reports are also coming out as the founding convention of
the Mars Society takes place in Boulder, Colorado.  Everett Gibson, a
member of the NASA/JSC team that first announced evidence of past life
in the meteorite, was scheduled to speak at the conference.



		  Two Earth-Crossing Asteroids Discovered

	A JPL telescope project designed to search for near-Earth
objects has discovered two asteroids whose orbits cross that of the
Earth, but astronomers emphasized that these asteroids pose no threat
to the planet for at least several decades.

	The two asteroids, designed 1998 OH and 198 OR2, are notable
because of their size.  Each is estimated to be 1-3 km (0.6-1.8 mi.)
in diameter, enough to cause serious global effects if one struck the
Earth.  They join about 125 other "potentially hazardous objects",
sizable asteroids whose orbits take them near the Earth.

	Neither asteroid is expected to pose any threat to Earth for
the foreseeable future, although follow-up observations will be made
to accurately determine their orbits.  With current data, they know
that one of the asteroids, 1998 OH, can come no closer than 5 million
kilometers (3 million miles) to the Earth.

	The asteroids were discovered using the Near Earth Asteroid
Tracking (NEAT) telescope, an automated 1-meter (39-inch) telescope
located on the summit of Haleakala, the tallest mountain on the
Hawaiian island of Maui.

	"Our goal is to discover and track all the potentially
dangerous asteroids and comets long before they are likely to approach
Earth," said NEAT Principal Investigator Eleanor Helin, a JPL
astronomer. "The discovery of these two asteroids illustrates how NEAT
is doing precisely what it is supposed to do."

	The discovery came after the NEAT telescope was upgraded last
month.  "Our upgraded equipment has speeded up the data processing
allowing us to analyze up to 40 gigabytes of data each night,
equivalent to 1,200 images of the sky," said project manager Steven
Pravdo.  "This shows that our efforts to find near-Earth objects are
paying off."

	  CD-ROM Review: "Russians in Space" by The Ultimax Group
			       by Jeff Foust

	CD-ROMs with information about the American space program are
relatively plentiful, but those with information about Soviet and
Russian efforts are much more difficult to find.  "Russians in Space",
a Russian CD-ROM translated into English for sale in the United
States, helps fill this gap with a multimedia exploration of Russian
and Soviet space history.

	The CD-ROM is divided into four sections: people, programs,
technology, and basics.  Each sections includes useful written content
in addition to photos and videos. It's the photos and videos that
really make this CD-ROM, as they provide imagery not readily available
elsewhere for the average space enthusiast, from the launch of an
Energia-Buran to a map of the Plesetsk Cosmodrome.

	The content seems a little hit-and-miss, though: the
cosmonauts section includes information on Gagarin and Tereshkova but
not Leonov or any of the modern Mir cosmonauts. Some of the section
descriptions seem to have suffered a little in the translation from
Russian: the "Personalia" (people) section includes section titles
"Those Who Made Rockets Fly" and "They Taught Rockets to Fly".  The
former is about rocket designers and the latter about cosmonauts,
although it's not readily obvious.

	Overall, "Russians in Space" is a good overview of the history
of Russian space efforts.  The collection of photos, videos, and other
information will make this a useful resource for those seeking to
learn more about Russian space programs.

	"Russians in Space" is a hybrid PC/Mac CD-ROM.  It can run on
PCs with Windows 3.1, 95/98, and NT and requires a 386SX or faster
processor, 4MB RAM (8MB recommended), a 2x or faster CD-ROM drive,
SVGA graphic card (640x480 with 256 colors or better), and an
MPC-compliant sound card.  It can run on Macs with System 7.0 or later
with a 68030 or faster processor, 4MB RAM (8MB recommended), a 2x or
faster CD-ROM, and at least a 256-color display.  See
http://www.catalog.com/ultimax for more information.  The cost is $29.95
plus shipping and handling, with 10% discounts for members of some
organizations, including the NSS and The Planetary Society.

Cerf Named JPL Visiting Scientist: A computer scientist that has
advocated the growth of the Internet throughout the solar system was
named as a Distinguished Visiting Scientist at the Jet Propulsion
Laboratory Tuesday, August 4. Vint Cerf, a vice president at the
telecommunications giant MCI and co-developer of the TCP/IP protocol
used to convey Internet traffic, will work with JPL scientists and
engineers and other industry experts to develop new protocols for
handling communications among spacecraft. "It took 20 years for the

names will be etched onto one of two microchips that will be attached
to the Stardust spacecraft, scheduled for launch early next year.  The
spacecraft will fly by the comet Wild-2, collecting samples of
cometary particles that will be returned to Earth in 2006. The
original signup effort garnered 136,000 signatures last fall.  The
second microchip was added in a promotion with the NSS in the spring
in conjunction with the release of the Paramount and Dreamworks

Timothy,

You seem to have chosen a reaction that is rather poor in terms of energy
produced for this comparison. Perhaps you would like to illustrate the same
relationship using something like He3 and Li6?

Hi Nels,

Multistaged fusion all the way up to iron should be theoretically possible,
but the yield isn't spectacular more than a well chosen single stage:

Take:
( I)   1 (2H) + 2 (3He) -> 1 (4He) + 1 (1H) +  18.4 MeV
(II)  24 (2H) + 2 (3H)  -> 1 (54)Fe         + 401.4 MeV

24 (2H) means 24 atoms of Hydrogen, where the Hydrogen has atomic mass 2.

Reaction (I) is the most efficient single fusion reaction.
Reaction (II) is the short-circuit of the multi stage fusion.

The input mass of reaction (I) is 1*2 + 2*3 = 5
The input mass of reaction (II) is 24*2 + 2*3 = 54

So we can repeat reaction (I) 54/5=10.8 times before we've used the same
amount of mass as needed for reaction (II).

Doing reaction (I) 10.8 times will yield: 10.8*18.4=198.7 MeV

So fusing all the way to Iron has a yield (401.4/198.7)=2 times better than
fusing merely to light elements.

So, all the trouble (eg. higher fusion temperature, unwanted fusion
ractions) for a two times higher yield, is likely not worth it.

Hello Lee,

You requested:
>You seem to have chosen a reaction that is rather poor in terms of energy
>produced for this comparison. Perhaps you would like to illustrate the same
>relationship using something like He3 and Li6?

BTW. I just discovered to have made a typo in my last letter, which luckely
did not continue in the calculations.

I originally wrote:
( I)   1 (2H) + 2 (3He) -> 1 (4He) + 1 (1H) +  18.4 MeV

But instead of 2 helium cores one needs only 1.

Here the correct version:
( I)   1 (2H) + 1 (3He) -> 1 (4He) + 1 (1H) +  18.4 MeV

------

Here's an example as closely to your choice:

- I've switched to the apparently more conventional notation.
- I don't know what the result of fusing He3 and Li6 will be.
  The simplest result would be B9 which is highly unstable (doesn't
  appear in my table), H1 + Be8 isn't ideal either because Be8 is
  also very unstable.
  So let me modify your which into He4 + Li6 -> B10

(III)  1 (He4) + 1 (Li6) -> 1 (B10) + 4.5 MeV

The initial weight is 4+6=10, so one can do reaction (III) 54/10=5.4 times
before one has used the same weight as reaction (II)

Doing reaction (III) 5.4 times will yield: 5.4*4.5MeV=24.3MeV

In this case fusing all the way to Iron would have given a 401.4/24.3=16.5
times higher yield.

So you may conclude that multi-stage fusion may be worth the effort. I can
even think of a multitude of reactions that have much lower yields per unit
of weight and which thus would show to be over 100 times worse than fusing
all the way to Iron.

But this approach is not very useful. We are trying to optimize "ease" and
"yield per unit weight". He4+Li6 is harder to fuse than H2+He3 AND has a
lower yield per unit of weight, thus two reasons for it being a bad choice.
My H2+He3 was one of the best choices according to the mentioned criteria.
I think there is no point in trying to find a worst case scenario.
If you feel this is not correct, don't hesitate to comment.

Timothy

D+D   -> T (1.01 MeV) + p (3.02 MeV) (50%)
      -> He3 (0.82 MeV) + n (2.45 MeV) (50%)  <- most abundant fuel
      -> He4 + about 20 MeV of gamma rays (about 0.0001%; depends
                                           somewhat on temperature.)
      (most other low-probability branches are omitted below)
D+T   -> He4 (3.5 MeV) + n (14.1 MeV)  <-easiest to achieve
D+He3 -> He4 (3.6 MeV) + p (14.7 MeV)  <-easiest aneutronic reaction
                                     "aneutronic" is explained below.
T+T   -> He4 + 2n + 11.3 MeVHe3+T -> He4 + p + n + 12.1 MeV (51%)
      -> He4 (4.8) + D (9.5) (43%)
      -> He4 (0.5) + n (1.9) + p (11.9) (6%)  <- via He5 decay

p+Li6 -> He4 (1.7) + He3 (2.3)      <- another aneutronic reaction
p+Li7 -> 2 He4 + 17.3 MeV (20%)
      -> Be7 + n -1.6 MeV (80%)     <- endothermic, not good.
D+Li6 -> 2He4 + 22.4 MeV            <- also aneutronic, but you
                                              get D-D reactions too.
p+B11 -> 3 He4 + 8.7 MeV <- harder to do, but more energy than p+Li6
n+Li6 -> He4 (2.1) + T (2.7)        <- this can convert n's to T's
n+Li7 -> He4 + T + n - some energy

As you can see from the table D+He3 is a good candidate for the second stage
if you use D+D as the first stage and then somehow manage to fuse the He3
produced before it can escape. Of course you also have to worry about
neutrons from the D+D reaction. Too bad we can't use the gamma rays produced
in the D+D reaction though... As you said, your notation is a little
different but it is understandable. Where did you get the 18.4 MeV though?

Notice that most of the reactions in this table produce He4 as a by-product.
My first choice would be a straight single stage D+Li6 or p+B11 using
antimatter catalysis or muon catalysis to start the reaction.

The first stage D+D->He3+n+3.27MeV does not really add a lot of energy
relative to 18.3MeV and as you mention it has a neutron as reaction product
which may disturb the second stage so much that the second stage reaction
isn't as efficient anymore. (Maybe even more than 3.27MeV less efficient.)

I wonder why our tables don't show p+D->He3+5.5MeV it looks like an
excellent candidate to be followed by a second stage (as do all single
end-product reactions). If this is a valid reaction, it may be followed by
my D+He3->He4+p+18.4MeV that would give a yield of 4.78MeV per nucleon.
(Fusing upto Fe54 starting with H2 and H3 will give a yield of 7.43MeV per
nucleon.)
But again I'm not sure if a second stage is as "easy" as we hope, it still
is very far away from the current fusion technology.

>Too bad we can't use the gamma rays produced in the D+D reaction though...

What would you use them for?

>As you said, your notation is a little different but it is understandable.
>Where did you get the 18.4 MeV though?

D+He3 -> He4 (3.6 MeV) + p (14.7 MeV)
 3.6+14.7=18.3MeV  My 18.4MeV is actually 18.35MeV, so the difference is
likely due to rounding errors.

>Notice that most of the reactions in this table produce He4 as a by-product.
>My first choice would be a straight single stage D+Li6 or p+B11 using

p+B11 would be better since it doesn't have D+D reactions as D+Li6 has. And
a bonus is that both p and B11 are abundant in nature, while D and Li6 are
harder to find. The only disadvantage is that it only yields 8.7MeV while
its reaction  materials consist of already 12 nuclei in total. (0.725MeV
per nucleon)
I wonder if a second stage reaction could significantly increase this.

Raw energy, of course.  Gamma rays are high-energy photons.

My brief thoughts on the whole fusion power thing are:

Any fusion drive that depends on uncommon elements or isotopes
probably implies that the fuel has to be gathered ahead of time
and stored on board.  Deuterium, tritium, helium-3, and so on are
not easy to come by and take significant time and energy to
refine out of a planetary atmosphere or ocean or the interstellar
medium.  The main reason such isotopes are considered for fusion
power plants on Earth is that the lower cost of fusing them looks
attractive even compared to the cost of refining them out of
seawater.  For spacecraft fuel I really believe that becomes a
significant disadvantage.  I think the only mitigating factor is
that it might not be too expensive to synthesize the uncommon
isotopes from the far more abundant common isotopes in order to
be able to run the fusion reactor with lower temperatures.

I also don't know where you got the fusion reaction that produces
iron directly from a bunch of hydrogen and helium, unless it's
the abbreviation of a whole bunch of intermediate reactions.  If
it's possible, it's really darn unlikely to be able to do it all
in one step.

I could see running a fusion reactor that would allow for a
few stages (say fusing from hydrogen up to relatively light stuff 
like carbon and oxygen).  Isn't the most common fusion reaction
in the universe the carbon cycle that fuses hydrogen with carbon
to produce an unstable nitrogen isotope that decays back into
carbon again?

Umm, I don't think the 3.6 MeV is usable, that is potential energy bound up
in the He4.

Li6 is common as mud on the back side of the moon. The D+D reactions are
very dependent upon temperature. If the D+Li6 reaction is hot enough there
are virtually no D+D reactions and hence very few neutrons.

It would seem that if we could somehow reflect this energy back into the
reaction it would provide enough energy to "pump" the reaction. Except of
course that unless it was made to reflect back and forth many millions of
times, it wouldn't hit anything, even at the core of a dense plasma. Ohh
well...

Actually, this is one of the driving factors behind colonies on the moon.
Both of these elements are very common there and extraction from lunar
regolith of relatively concentrated He3 and Li6 using solar power has GOT to
be cheaper than extraction from seawater.

Hello Steve,

>and stored on board.

In the past we calculated that scooping matter during travel in
interstellar space would likely get us too little mass. So I indeed assumed
that mass would be stored on board or that it would be launched in advance
along the track that the starship will follow.

For multiple flights that may be true, but for a single interstellar flight
optimizing the fuel may be worth the additional work of refining the wanted
isotopes for the fuel. Isolating isotopes may not be easy, but the
technology to do it is available.

I think another reason that makes isolating or synthesizing special
isotopes worth the expenses is that some of the reactions involving less
common isotopes may deliver more than 2 times the amount of energy per unit
of mass.

In my 8/17 letter I wrote:

   (II)  24 (2H) + 2 (3H)  -> 1 (54)Fe         + 401.4 MeV

   ...

   Reaction (II) is the short-circuit of the multi stage fusion.

I don't actually have/know all the steps in between, but it wasn't my
purpose to display what in reality was possible. I merely wanted to compare
a single-stage fusion reaction with the best possible way (energy-wise) to
get iron. (I could have chosen worse possibilities, that would have
strengthened my point that multistage fusion isn't worth the trouble.)

My goal was to show that some of the best single stage fusion reactions
would not be that much worse than complex and likely hard to realize multi
staged fusion reactions.

I'm pretty sure that both the 3.6 and 14.7 MeV are kinetic (heat) energy
(since the energy ratio of both particles is exactly what one would expect
from their mass ratio). Can anyone confirm this?

            Space Access Society Political Alert 8/20/98
          "Military Spaceplane" Technology Project Funding
___________________________________________________________________

The impression among many of our advisors a year ago was that we'd
just about won, and could all go tend our own gardens.  This, alas,
has turned out not to be the case.  (On a personal note, being burnt
out from spending much of the last twelve years at this has gotten
boring. - HV)  There's work to do.  We're back.

We were never all that far gone, actually - we've been keeping an
eye on developments, butting in once or twice when needed, and of
course we put on Space Access '98 this spring, the latest of our
annual gettogethers of some of the more interesting players in the
cheap access field.  (We'll be doing it again next spring; we're
currently looking at Friday April 16th through Sunday April 18th -
drop us a note ASAP if you know of a major schedule conflict we've
missed that weekend; we're close to closing the hotel contract.)

The specific thing that's stirred us out of our public silence is
a chance to usefully increase the diversity of the US government's
reusable launcher technology development efforts.  Your help over
the next couple weeks can improve the odds of this happening
considerably.
___________________________________________________________________

 - Summary

The USAF Military Spaceplane (MSP) technology project was line-item
vetoed last fall.  Now that the line-item veto has been tossed out
by the courts, we want to see that $10 million in MSP funding for
this year restored, and we want to see at least $25 million added
for MSP to next years budget.  The Congress is in recess until after
Labor Day - your Representative and Senators will likely be making
appearances locally at "town meetings", Labor Day events etc.  You
may be able to find an opportunity to ask them personally to support
adding at least $25 million for USAF Military Spaceplane research to
the FY'99 Defense budget.  You can definitely let their DC offices
know what you want.
___________________________________________________________________

 - Background

The USAF "Military Spaceplane" (MSP) technology project grew out of
the DC-X program office at Phillips Labs in New Mexico.  The
project's goal is to put together and test technologies to support
eventual development of low-cost fast-turnaround reusable military
spacecraft.

USAF MSP has been severely budget-limited, bottoming out with last
year's line-item veto, but they have managed to bring one project,
the X-40A "Space Maneuver Vehicle" (SMV), a reusable recoverable
autonomous upper stage, to the point of its successful first flight
test last week - an unpowered drop-test that checked out the X-40A's
low-speed aerodynamics and autoland capability.

USAF MSP has other worthwhile projects stuck at the planning stage
for lack of funds, in particular their Integrated Technology Testbed
(ITTB), an expandable ground-test rig that would bring together
representative reusable launcher hardware and run it through
repeated realistic space-mission simulations.

ITTB might eventually, depending on both funding and interim
results, be evolved into some sort of son-of-DC-X low-cost flight
demonstrator - but the project is designed to return useful
knowledge across a range of funding levels.

Space Access Society believes that USAF MSP is a good value for
taxpayer dollars, for a number of reasons.

 - They have a good track record, building the DC-X reusable rocket
demonstrator and flying it eight times (before NASA took it over)
for roughly a hundred million dollars total, not to mention their
recent first-flight X-40A success.

 - The potential USAF requirements MSP is aiming at have much in
common with potential commercial RLV operator requirements - fast
turnaround, small ground crews, minimal fixed ground infrastructure
for dispersed operations, and both ground-to-orbit and high-speed
point-to-point flight.  The operational characteristics and also the
technologies USAF MSP is looking at are largely complementary to,
not competitive with, the direction various NASA RLV efforts are
taking.  (NASA RLV has displayed a tendency to concentrate on
radical technological advances while paying less attention to the
mundane operational considerations that are of critical interest to
both potential military and commercial operators.)  Put another way,
USAF and Fedex requirements have a lot more in common with each
other than either has with NASA's.

 - MSP is cheap insurance against both hostile space competition in
the next century, and against possible problems with NASA RLV
efforts, about which the jury is still very much out.  If nothing
else, a little friendly competition concentrates minds no end...

 Congressional Background

Congress is out of session until after Labor Day, when they'll
reconvene for the final push to pass all the FY'99 budget bills by
early October, leaving them some time to campaign before the
November elections.  The House and Senate versions of the Defense
Appropriation bill are already passed and ready for the conference
committee to hammer out the differences, and neither contains
anything for Military Spaceplane.

Normally this would mean no chance for MSP; Congressional procedure
usually forbids adding anything in conference that wasn't in at
least one version of the bill.  But these are unusual circumstances:
the reason there was no MSP money in either bill was that MSP was
among the handful of items line-item vetoed last year, and until the
courts overturned the line-item veto, there seemed no point in
including MSP again only to be line-item vetoed again.

 - SAS Action Recommendations

 Who To Target

Members of the House and Senate Appropriations Defense subcommittees
(plus the overall Appropriations Committee bosses) are key; they
will most likely be the Defense Appropriations conference members.
Other members of the Appropriations Committees also have influence
here and are worth contacting, as are members of the House and
Senate Defense Authorizations committees.  And even those not in any
of these positions can if they choose put in a word with their
colleagues who are.

See attached lists for whether your Representative or Senators are
on the Defense subcommittees.  (Your 9-digit zip code and www.vote-
smart.org will tell you who your Representative and Senators are,
what committees they're on, and what their DC and local office phone
and fax numbers are.)

 What To Do

Congress is out of session until after Labor Day - this means many
Representatives and some Senators will be back in the home districts
warming up for this fall's reelection campaigns, appearing at
numerous public and private events.  Those of you who have some
previous experience at this might want to prepare a five-minute
presentation on why USAF MSP should be funded and try to make an
appointment to brief your Representative or Senator.

Any of you feeling moderately ambitious, articulate, and presentable
might want to call your Representative or Senator's local office and
ask for their local event schedule with an eye toward one where you
might have a chance to give MSP funding a ten-second pitch, and go
do it.  A "town meeting" event where you can deliver a question from
the audience, a picnic where you can walk up, introduce yourself as
a constituent, and ask support for MSP funding, etc...

If you do this, bring along a one-page letter describing what it is
you're asking for, as below, so you can hand it to one of the
staffers likely to be nearby after you make your point.  Then follow
up by contacting the DC office of the person you've pitched, as
below, mentioning this is something you asked their boss for at
whatever the event was.

The default is to call, write, or fax your Congressman's and/or your
Senators' DC offices, and ask that they support adding $25 million
to the (FY'99) Defense budget for Military Spaceplane technology
work in Program Element 603401F, in the Defense Appropriations
Conference.

If you call, ask to speak to the person who handles defense matters.
(If they tell you their boss isn't on any of the defense committees,
ask them if their boss could pass this along to one of his/her
colleagues who is.)  Chances are you'll get switched to their
voicemail.  Voicemail or in person, identify yourself as a
constituent (Hi, I'm Joe Smith from Sheboygan), make your pitch
briefly, give them a one-sentence reason why you think it's
important, thank them for their time, and ring off.  If you do get
them live and they have questions, do your best to answer them.

If you write or fax, keep it short, one page max, and state your
main point at the start, then briefly give supporting points.  Make
sure to sign it with where you're from ("Joe Smith, Sheboygan") so
they know you're an actual constituent.

And of course, either way, be polite - the staffers who'll likely be
handling your contact are chronically underpaid and overworked.  One
bad impression can waste a lot of good impressions.
