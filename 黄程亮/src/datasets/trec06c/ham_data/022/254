Dear Sam,

It is so strange as you already replace all the chips. The "testanalogs()"
is used to test A/D feature and analog port of MC68HC11. It will prompt  you
"Press START to  test knob..."  You then press START button and the reading
of A/D port will come out to LCD screen.

This voltage is divided from knob as you've turning the knob. In all cases
(even the knob doesn't work), you should get a reading between 0-255.

Please ship the board back to us and we will be able to figure it out and
repair for you.

Our shipping address:

Hui, Pak Ki
Robot Store(HK)
Flat-E 13/F Yik Hon Bldg.,
72-78 Java Road,
North Point,
HONG KONG

Sorry for any inconvenience cause.


Thanks and Best Regards,

Patrick
