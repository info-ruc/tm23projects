Thank you very much for your interest.  We are trying to seriously consider
the topic, and make folks think about space as something we can do in te near
future not a few centuries from now.

Glad you liked it, and thanks for the listing!

Thank you.

I'm afraid  LIT isn't really a university.  There was some intention
origionally that it could develop into an online one, but that didn't happen.
Its just an on-line group that debates ideas about practical mid 21st century
star travel concepts.  Its gotten quieter over the last year or two, but for
the first couple of years their were hundreds of subcribers to the
newsletters, and a lot of debate and analysis.  (You might want to browse
throu the newsletter archives.)  Several of us aer or were people from NASA or
the aerospace busness.  Lots more were everything from students to
submariners.  What you se in the site and the archives is what we came up
with.

Hope this helps.

 CLUB * for * EXPANSION * of * CIVILIZATION * into * SPACE

              grouping people interested in 
          the development of human civilization 
       and its expansion into extraterrestial space
-----------------------------------------------------------

WELCOME!                                           WELCOME!

We would like to invite you for a visit to WWW pages 
of a new Internet Club * URANOS * 

In our opinion, expansion of humanity into space is 
a prerequisite for further development of our civilization.
We are afraid, however, that recognition of this necessity
is still infrequent among people, which may constitute 
a bigger problem than possible technological difficulties.
Hence it is necessary to constantly remind people that 
the world does not end at the limit of Earth's athmosphere.
-----------------------------------------------------------
At the address:
  http://www.uranos.eu.org/uranose.html
you will find, among others:
- Our Club Manifesto, spelling out our views on 
  the current challenges facing the Earth's civilization;
- A rich collection of links to the most interesting 
  WWW pages dedicated to space exploration;
- Many more attractions - in preparation!

PLEASE PAY US A VISIT AND HELP US IN OUR ACTIVITIES!

Club Founders:
-- Andrzej K. Brandt
-- Zenon Kulpa

-----------------------------------------------------------
PLEASE NOTE: The activities of our Club are aimed mostly
at the Polish-speaking community around the world. 
However, since encouragements, advice, and any other help 
from the rest of the world are also gladly received and 
greatly appreciated by us, we maintain also English 
versions of the more important pages of our site.

Does anyone know anything else about this?


"The most amazing thing I saw this week was the rocket engine of the future.
It's been the life's work of astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz. He started
working on the plasma engine in college, and now, at age 48, he's got a
demonstration version of the engine in his lab in Houston. The scale model
is about 30 feet long.
I'm not a plasma physicist, but Chang-Diaz is, and he explains the engine
this way: You put a small amount of hydrogen into one end of the engine.
It's turned into plasma, a burning gas as hot as the surface of the sun.
Radio waves from an on-board transmitter are used to create the plasma and
then a series of electromagnets that circle the central chamber keep the
plasma from touching the metal sides of the engine. The super-hot plasma is
then moved down to the exhaust nozzle, where is pushes the engine away.

Unlike engines that use solid or liquid fuel, the plasma engine is much more
efficient. Chang-Diaz says it gets more miles per gallon than you can
imagine. In addition, it's much faster than anything in use today. It can
travel from the Earth to Mars in 90 days. That's twice as fast as current
technology allows.

Chang-Diaz is working with a group of college students to develop the engine
and one of them, Lenny Cassady, has worked out a flight plan. He believes it
will be ready to launch on May 16, 2018. That's about the time Lenny says
he'd be ready to fly the plasma-powered spaceship to Mars."

On a small scale, it is used in welding and metal fabrication. Plasma beams
have been around for over ten years in industry. Of course, these
applications are the equivalent of a penlight when compared to a plasma
engine.

someone was able to create great amounts of energy (enough to hurl forth a
starship at high velocity while powering a super elctro magnet) simply by
juicing up some hydrogen with radio waves, there would be a lot more useful

I found more information on the plasma engine mentioned on CNN.

I knew about VASIMR before, but had not made the connection with Franklin
Chang-Diaz. These abstracts may help give a better understanding of his
plasma engine. I pointed out to the group once before that much of the
research going into VASIMR can also be applied to other concepts such as
ACMF that are not as far along.

This device is apparently is in test stand stage (it could be flyable in a
few years) while ACMF is in test bed stage. There are also several other
approaches such as Dense Plasma Focus, Star Thrust, Inertial Electrostatic
Confinement, and the Synchrotron Radiation Drive currently in various stages
of testing.

Both VASIMR and ACMF/AIMSTAR offer delta v in the +200km/sec range making
them suitable for relatively rapid interplanetary travel.


Mini-conference on Deep Space Plasma Thrusters.
MIXED session, Thursday afternoon, November 20
North 6, Convention Center
[pThpM2.01] Research Status of the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma
Rocket
F. R. Chang-Diaz ((ASPL/JSC/NASA))

Research in the VASIMR approach to high-power rocket propulsion has
continued since 1980. The system consists of a three-stage asymmetric
magnetic mirror, featuring a hybrid magnetic nozzle. Plasma is injected,
heated and subsequently exhausted to provide modulated thrust and specific
impulse at constant power. Plasma injector studies initially involve a
modified Lorentz Force Accelerator. Other injector concepts, including
helicons and hollow cathodes are briefly examined. Plasma heating
methodsinvolve electron and ion cyclotron resonance, though other efficiency
enhancements such as whistlers and mode coupling are being explored. Plasma
detachment dynamics from the magnetic nozzle are considered. In the low
temperature, high density regime, the use of a co-axial, hypersonic neutral
gas boundary layer near the nozzle throat increases the thrust while
triggering collisional plasma detachment. In the high temperature, low
density regime, inducing time-dependent magnetic ripples in the nozzle is a
potential turbulence-inducing mechanism for plasma detachment. Experimental
studies currently focus on plasma injection and heating to power levels of
up to 200kW in pulses of several seconds. A diagnostics set characterizes
the plasma conditions throughout the system. Performance and advantages over
other rocket technologies are presented in the context of a mission to Mars.


[pThpM2.02] A Plasma Diagnostic Set for the Study of a Variable Specific
Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket
J. P. Squire, F. R. Chang-Diaz ((ASPL/JSC/NASA)), R. Bengtson, Jr. Bussell,
V. T. Jacobson, A. J. Wootton ((University of Texas at Austin)), E. A.
Bering, T. Jack, A. Rabeau ((University of Houston))

The Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory (ASPL) is developing a Variable
Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) using an RF heated magnetic
mirror operated asymmetrically. We will describe the initial set of plasma
diagnostics and data acquisition system being developed and installed on the
VASIMR experiment. A U.T. Austin team is installing two fast reciprocating
probes: a quadruple Langmuir and a Mach probe. These measure electron
density and temperature profiles, electrostatic plasma fluctuations, and
plasma flow profiles. The University of Houston is developing an array of 20
highly directional Retarding Potential Analyzers (RPA) for measuring ion
energy distribution function profiles in the rocket plume, giving a
measurement of total thrust. We have also developed a CAMAC based data
acquisition system using LabView running on a Power Macintosh communicating
through a 2 MB/s serial highway. We will present data from initial plasma
operations and discuss future diagnostic development.


[pThpM2.03] An Injector for the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma
Rocket
T. W. Glover ((Rice University)), F. R. Chang-Diaz, J. P. Squire
((ASPL/JSC/NASA)), A. A. Chan ((Rice University))

We present a summary of progress on the development of a plasma injector for
NASA's VASIMR (Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket) engine. The
plasma rocket constrains a flowing plasma in an asymmetric magnetic bottle
and exhausts it through a magnetic nozzle to produce thrust. The injector is
a plasma source located on the axis of symmetry, forward of the series of
coils forming the constraining magnetic field. The injector is intended to
produce a well-collimated jet of highly ionized plasma which will enter the
central cell of the machine through its forward mirror. The prototype design
is based on that of a Lorentz Force Accelerator developed as a thruster by
the electric propulsion research group at Princeton. Our investigation
focuses on the effects of the rocket's magnetic field on the operation of
the injector, the effect of a local magnetic field on the discharge
behavior, and the effectiveness of discharge initiation by glow discharge
versus initiation by ECRH. We evaluate the performance of this prototype
injector by comparing the characteristics of the plasma it inserts into the
central cell of the engine with the characteristics called for in the design
of the plasma rocket.


[pThpM2.04] ICRF Development for the Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma
Rocket
P. M. Ryan ((Oak Ridge National Laboratory)), F. W. Baity, G. C. Barber, M.
D. Carter, D. J. Hoffman, E. F. Jaeger, D. J. Taylor ((ORNL)), F. R.
Chang-Diaz, J. P. Squire ((ASPL/NASA/JSC)), G. McCaskill ((Lockheed Martin
Corporation))

The feasibility of using magnetically vectored and rf-heated plasmas for
space propulsion (F. R. Chang-Diaz, et al.\rm, Bull. Am. Phys. Soc., 41,
1541 (1996)) is being investigated experimentally on an asymmetric magnetic
mirror device at the Advanced Space Propulsion Laboratory (ASPL), Johnson
Space Center, NASA. Analysis of the antenna interaction with and the wave
propagation through the dense plasma propulsion system is being studied at
ORNL(Oak Ridge National Laboratory, managed by Lockheed Martin Energy
Research Corp. for the U.S. Department of Energy under contract number
DE-AC05-96OR22464.), using antenna design codes developed for ICH systems
and mirror codes developed for the EBT experiment at ORNL. The present
modeling effort is directed toward the ASPL experimental device. Antenna
optimization and performance, as well as the design considerations for
space-qualified rf components and systems (minimizing weight while
maximizing reliability) will be presented.


[pThpM2.05] Single Particle Dynamics in a Variable Specific Impulse
Magnetoplasma Rocket
A. Ilin ((Lockheed Martin Space Mission Systems amp; Services)), F. R.
Chang-Diaz, J. P. Squire ((ASPL/JSC/NASA))

The behavior of single charged particles in a Variable Specific Impulse
Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is examined. Of particular importance is the
effect of a magnetic nozzle in enhancing the axial momentum of the exhaust.
Also, different geometries and rocket asymmetries are considered. The
magnetic configuration is modeled with an adaptable mesh which increases
accuracy without compromising the speed of the simulation. The single
particle trajectories are integrated with a finite difference approach which
can quickly solve for systems of thousands of particles in a reasonable time
(1-2 hours) and without the need for a powerful supercomputer. The magnetic
model is also used to examine the possibility for magnetic shielding of
human spacecraft, equipped with VASIMR propulsion systems, against some
forms of solar radiation.

Correction, AIMSTAR is claiming delta v in excess of 900 km/sec, making it
almost four times better than the nearest plasma engine.

For interstellar use, we would need to boost this to at least 90,000
km/sec....

In general, its like a very big ion drive.  Very effectiv,but dependant on an
external power source.  So while it may be much more "fuel efficent" on
reactino mass, it may not be in power plant fuel.

Kelly,

I don't recall seeing any power requirements mentioned anywhere, but a
Lithium Lorentz Force drive requires as a minimum a 30 kW power source. Only
Russian built space reactors currently supply this much, although there is a
40 kW design being tested by NASA.

There is mention of heating the plasma to power levels of up to 200 kW in
pulses of several seconds, but no mention of how much power that would
require.

I saw mention of a new, more powerful klystron being tested, but don't
remember the specifics.

Lee

The stated delta v's assume particular payload and mass ratios which include
the fuel. Simply adding engines does not give an equivalent increase in
delta v. Typical payload ratio are 0.2 which means each engine (with no
increase in payload) would only add 40 km/sec.

No, see above.

No, they won't. Too bad.

Power isn't really the problem. It is a combination of power (as thrust) and
ISP. Current engines with sufficiently high ISPs don't have sufficient
thrust and vice versa. You sort of put your finger on it with the constant 1
g acceleration thing. It isn't really necessary to accelerate at 1 g for the
whole trip - just until we have achieved a sufficiently high cruising
velocity to get there in a reasonable time period. To me that means 0.9 c or
better, other people on the group will settle for as little as 0.3 c.

These sound good, but how do they expect to generate the power to run these
engines?  Great spec impulse isn't much help if you need to carry along a huge
reactor or something.

The fusion systems I used for the Explorer and Fuel/sail designs had spec imp
of over a million.  Even with that the fuel ratios for the ships were
stagering.

The analysis I did a long time ago, which was in terms of
mass-energy conversion and fuel-to-payload ratios, implied that
fusion had pretty a exorbitant fuel-to-payload ratio for getting
to high relativistic speeds (0.8 - 0.9 c), on the order of 10^6:1
or worse.  To get a fuel-to-payload ratio of less than 10:1 we
pretty much have to have an antimatter photon rocket.

Timothy did indicate that you can get pretty good thrust with
using lots of low-velocity reaction mass, but unfortunately if
you make the reasonable definition that "fuel" is really "energy
source plus reaction mass", this implies an even worse
fuel-to-payload ratio, especially if you're trying to go for long
continuous acceleration.  Sure, you can get theoretically good
results if you make a reaction that pushes a lot of mass at a low
speed in one direction and a little mass to very high speed in
the other, but that only works if the reaction is essentially
instantaneous.

The ultimate result is that even for really fast interplanetary
transportation you don't need to have any major amount of
mass-energy conversion, but for relativistic interstellar travel
you do; you have to convert a mass larger than the payload to
energy to get a payload to speeds of 0.8c or higher, and this
requires either an incredible amount of low-efficiency fuel or
even a pretty amazing amount of antimatter.

Hmmm, now that I think of it, I think I made a serious mistake on that
payload ratio of 0.2, that should have been 0.2 percent, which means
increasing the number of engines is even less helpful than I said.

All true. To put it simplistically, an interstellar drive needs to expel
LOTS of reaction mass at HIGH velocity. Nothing we currently have can do
both at the same time. These newer plasma engine concepts come close and the
various concepts for "hybrid" antimatter catalyzed fusion may do even
better, but they all are still far short of what is really needed for a true
interstellar drive.

Being a science fiction author is SO much easier...

Well, I'll admit that 40kW is a lot of power, but it is possible, even with

Yeah, the big factor is fuel consumption vrs thrust thing.  You want to get up

True which is why Explorer and Fuel/Sail peak out at about .4 C.

However the 900 KM sec exaust velocity (power source unidentified) would be
far worse.

Thats not what I ment.  To generate the power, you need fuel, lots of it.  The
fuel weighht is what drage all this stuff down.

Gives you an idea why ultra conservative NASA is geting desperate enough to

That was a 900 km/sec delta v, or total change in velocity, not an exhaust
velocity. As such, it is the absolute best we can currently do.

Huh? I was talking about a 40 kW space rated nuclear reactor such as those
designed for satellites. Yes it is heavy, but not because it requires lots
of fuel. The purpose of this power was to drive a very large klystron tube
which heats the hydrogen fuel into a plasma. NOW you have lots of fuel - for
the engines, not to generate power.

This engine approaches fusion engines in efficiency, making it ideal for
interplanetary missions. It could even put a probe through one of the nearer
star systems within fifty years.

I.E. the reactor fisionables are the fuel, and are heavy compared to fusion
fuel to generate the same power.  This sounds like it would be pretty heavy
compared to a direct fusion system.  I.E. all the fusion energy directly
converted to exaust kinetic energy.

No, it still uses hydrogen as fuel. The reactor fissionables are actually an
insignificant part of the mass. Especially compared to the mass requirements
of a true fusion system. Think of the reactor and its fissionables as simply
being the "engine", a 40 kW reactor weighs only slightly more than the RTG
that powers Cassini.

How much does it weigh.? How much thrust does it give?

  Kelly,

I don't have much in specifics on the plasma engine. This link is about all
there is. There used to be a great deal on the web earlier this year, but
most of those pages are gone (and the ones I could find are all blank,
hmmm).

I am fairly certain that it is lighter than AIMSTAR, but not by much. I
already posted links to the AIMSTAR site. If you need me to post them again
let me know.

Here is the link to CNN's story.

Sounds like the web.  Very fadish.  Nothing stays on very long.

Ok, thanks for the links.  Thou I doubt CNN will have much tech detail.  I
would have thought the NASA site would stay up?

Oh well.

Kelly,

The link and the page at the University of Texas are still there, just no
information. There were two tables of performance data from the last test
but both tables' links are broken. I have tried another site that mirrors
the University site with the same results.

That was one of the reasons I posted the request for information in the
first place. I thought someone else might be familiar with this research and
could tell me more.

Hi sir,

Forgive me, I'm just a lowly  chemist with a huge interest in astronomy and
physics.   The most plausible and acheivable goal for an STL (Slower than
light) ship sounds like a Bussard RAMJET (Elegent design) which could attain
speeds in excess of 50% the speed of light.

You have a better idea?  i want to know. write me back

	The Bussard ramjet idea is indeed elegant.  Unfortunately, the
interstellar medium is too thin to make this really practical.  Also, i
understand that the interstellar medium is especially thin locally for
some reason (i forget). Bad luck.  Check out the L.I.T pages having to do
with the engine for the "Explorer" type starship, I think it's
explained better there.`

A Bussard Ramjet will get you up to 30%c, if interstellar hydrogen fuel
is abundant enough, but will not go much faster. Drag with the
interstellar medium will soon equal thrusting ratio, and acceleration
will cease. This is not my idea, but one gleaned from quite a bit of
study on ramjets. If you want to really use the vacuum of space for
travel, you are venturing into something completely different, and not
yet understood.

I believe there is increasing evidence that there are chains of organic
molecules evenly spread throught space (I assume this means through-out our
galaxy...) which could possibly explain away some of the 99% missing matter
we can observe through gravitational effects.  If you could use this as
fuel, then there would be an abundant supply.

Garth,

The original Bussard Ramjet concept, although meeting the basic interstellar
drive requirements of not carrying around huge amounts of fuel, quickly runs
into problems. Space is not homogeneous, that is, the concentration of
interstellar hydrogen and other matter is not consistent throughout space.
It is thought that a concentration of hydrogen of 1 atom per cubic
centimeter is necessary for a ramjet to work. Unfortunately, our solar
system is located in the middle of a giant cosmic "soap bubble" where the
interior concentrations of hydrogen are far lower than what is necessary for
a ramjet.

I'm not so sure about Kyle's assertion that drag places an upper limit of
.3c on a ramjet's velocity. I have also studied them for almost twenty years
and don't recall having ever seen that statement. (Kyle, citation please?)
It may be that once the craft is up to a certain speed, the "apparent"
density might be great enough to sustain a decent acceleration. Perhaps a
hybrid between onboard tankage and scoop collection...

Nearby supernova explosion. The shock front cleanses the region
surrouding the supernova of interstellar elements (hydrogen, helium,
rarer heavy elements, etc.)

My mistake...it wasn't 30%c; it was 10%c as an upper limit. Nick
Herbert, PhD, has done his work on this, and here is your requested
citation:

"In 1960 Robert Bussard of TRW Corporation proposed using the
interstellar medium itself--which contains a few hydrogen atoms per
cubic centimeter--as a rocket fuel. The fact that the ships fuel is
obtained from the outside eliminates the exhaust-velocity limit; the
Bussard jet is capable of efficiently accelerating to speeds greater
than its own exhaust. The Bussard ramjet would employ an enormous scoop
constructed out of electromagnetic fields to collect and funnel hydrogen
into a nuclear-reaction motor. The Bussard jet actually becomes more
efficient at high speeds, because the faster it goes, the more hydrogen
it collects. Many science fiction writers have used Bussard ramjets in
their flights of fancy, however the Bussard principle suffers from the
fact that at high ship speeds the fuel is not standing still but impacts
the ship's scoop at enormous velocity. The incoming fuel constitutes a
huge headwind, which becomes increasingly difficult to overcome as the
ship goes faster. The speed of the Bussard jet soon reaches an upper
limit--about 10 percent of light speed--where thrust is equal to wind
resistance and the ship can accelerate no further."

That from Nick Herbert's book "Faster than light: superluminal loopholes
in physics." It might get you to 30%c in this thinned out region, if you
can get enough fuel. But then, there is our viscious fuel/velocity
circle again. It's just my opinion, and I don't want to start a thread
on this, but we need two things if we ever wish to seriously attempt
interstellar flight: 1. A way to interact with spacetime to provide
fuel-less propulsion, and 2. A method of travelling faster than light.
Both of which I believe are possible.

Something about the big bang and chaos and the way the universe formed. I
don't remember the whole theory, but I know that they have been able to
model it using chaos theory.

Anyway, the Universe looks like a big tub full of soap bubbles with most of
the stars and matter concentrated in the "film" of the bubbles. We aren't in
the "film", we're in the middle of one. I've got a picture around here
somewhere.

regarding the discussion on the Bussard ramjet, you mentioned that:

I agree with both statements. However, I am curious as to your reason(s)
*why* you believe FTL travel is possible.

Well I would also be VERY interested in WHY you think FTL is posible...

However I do not fully agree that those two condintions are that
neccesary, as long as you can fulfill the 1st one (reactionless drives)
then you can probably build a reasonably unexpensive (in global terms)
starship to get to the nearby stars in a decade or so. That should be
enough for the so called "planet-hoping" method of space conquest IMO.
