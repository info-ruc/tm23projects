dear all,

we are moving computers within the building next week, and the el.www
web server will be down beginning Monday for a while -- hopefully,
just a day or two.

in the meantime, please use the old URL to access the Handy Board web
site:

  http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/

this server should stay up.

regards,
fred
