I am having some problems with my handyboard and before going out and buying a
new chip, I thought I might get some confirmation. The board works okay, but no
longer stores the program. I can download the pcode and it stays when the board
is powered down. But if I download a small program it is lost after powerdown.
It will run the program okay, I just cant reset it. The programs that I am
downloading are not very big. 

I was thinking it was the SRAM, being that it is what holds the programs when
the board is powered off. 

Questions, Ideas.

I was reading thru the EEtimes and came across an IR emitter diode. 660mW at
880 nm. The company is located in Plano. Clairex at 972.422.4676.
Their website is kinda of sparse: www.clairex.com
