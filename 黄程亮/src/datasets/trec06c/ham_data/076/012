Dear Ms. Brimander.

Thanks for the information.  As a result of this change, would it now be
possible to get any more specific information in real time about our
credit card charges, other than that there was a charge?

MBNA  acquired First Union’s credit card portfolio as of June 30, 2000.  What this means to MIT is that MBNA will be the new providing bank for our VIP Purchasing Card.  Although the sale was announced last summer, the actual conversion to MBNA will not take place until June 2001.
