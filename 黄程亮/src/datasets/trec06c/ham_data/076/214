	I don't know if you ever got your question answered or not.  The
errors on Fig. 2 are the errors from the purity fit.  They are not simply
statistical errors.  This means that they are inflated compared to purely
statistical errors.  I agree that the one point in the CC with small error
bars looks suspect, but in every analysis method I have used, I get the 
same qualitative feature.  The caption to the plot could indicate that 
the errors are the errors on the fit and are larger than statistical
errors alone.
