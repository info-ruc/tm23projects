Mike,

 Thanks for your note. You can take these few comments now or wait until
 you post for the collaboration... ( by the way, did this go through style
 review yet??)

Anyway:

 o since you don't habve a PRL format version, I have no idea how long this
   is, but 5 figures may be a stretch for PRL??

 o in the last sentence of the abstract and of the paper, I would prefer 
   the order of the sentences turned around.. its a matter of giving the 
   data preeminence and letting the theory agree or not ..

   .. if you leave it as is then in the abstract, I would change 
       ".. yield satisfactory..." to ".. show satisfactory.."

 o page 7, para 5, "represent" doesn't seem correct somehow??

 o page 7, para 5, I would move ref 7 to follow "luminosity" rather than
   "Tevatron"... since you have reference 6 in mid-sentence Tom cannot tell
   me that it must come at the end.

 o page 7, para 5, change ".., and a two forward .."
                       to ".., and two forward .."

 o page 8, para 2, change ".. beam pipe which detect .."
                       to ".. beam pipe, which detect .."

 o page 9, para 3, change "A [9] Monte Carlo, overlaid .."
                       to "A Monte Carlo[9], overlaid .."

 o page 10, para 2, 
            change " Identical selecttion criteria that determines photon .."
                to " Identical selecttion criteria that determine photon .."
 
 Regards,  Mont
