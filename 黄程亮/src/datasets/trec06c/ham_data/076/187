Curtis, mp-users,

The problem is that XML is not nice about element ordering.
Specifically, the people who developed XML thought that it
would be a breeze to keep elements in order.  So they made
it extraordinarily difficult to write a DTD in which the
elements can appear in any order.  Consequently, our XML
DTD (and the ESRI XML DTD) require things to be in order.
But if you use extensions (such as in ESRIprof80.ext), 
the standard DTD doesn't include them, so putting them in
anywhere breaks the element order constraint.  Moreover
the element ordering in the ESRI DTD is different from
that in the FGDC DTD because of (and only because of) the
use of the ESRI extensions.  This is not to pick on ESRI;
the same could be said of the Biological profile. 

If you only use standard elements, it's to your advantage
to keep them in the order specified by the standard, since
your records can then be passed by a validating XML parser
using the DTD.  But if you use extensions, then you have to
use a DTD that includes them if you want to pass the record
through a validating XML parser.  What should mp do?  It 
doesn't know how you intend to use the XML record subsequently.
So it assumes you're using only the standard elements and so
writes them all out first, in the order they appear in the
Standard.  Extensions are then written out after the standard
elements so as not to disrupt the order of the standard ones.

(By "after the standard elements" I mean that wherever you
have an extension, *at that level of the hierarchy* the
standard elements are written first.  So Attribute is
written with its standard children first, then the ESRI
Attribute_Type, Attribute_Width, Attribute_Precision after
all of the standard children of that particular Attribute.
The hierarchical structure is retained, but the order may
be changed.)

However, as you note, some wish to use Tkme to edit metadata
that was first created by ArcCatalog.  This works, but it does
move the ESRI extensions around in the file.  What's inelegant
about this is that most people won't ever need to or want to
use an XML parser to validate, so we're bending the metadata
out of shape for a relatively rare exigency.

My solution is to change the tools to recognize a directive 
in the config file which, when set, makes the XML output in
the order it was received.  So write

output
  xml
    order as-is

to tell mp, mq, xtme, or Tkme to leave the elements in the
order they got them.  The default is still to order them as
they occur in the Standard:

output
  xml
    order standard

If you specify "standard" as the value, this gives you the
current-default behavior of reordering the elements to fit
the CSDGM.

So the "as-is" order, combined with the new ESRIprof80.ext
file, allows you to edit ArcCatalog metadata in place without
messing up anything that ESRI has already done for you.  For
those who might wish to take advantage of Tkme's snippets
features, for example, to paste commonly-used bits of metadata
into their records, this could be a helpful method.

The other use people make of this element ordering is to
prepare metadata for import into SMMS.  The SGML ingest
feature of SMMS works only if the elements are in the standard
order (at least this was true some time ago), so the neat 
trick was to use mp to generate XML, swap the SGML directive
for the XML directive in the output, and treat the modified
XML output as SGML, feeding it to SMMS.  That procedure is 
left intact by this change.

These changes are incorporated in the current versions of
the source package, the Linux package, and both Windows packages.  
I have not yet updated the Solaris or SGI packages.

Please let me know if this doesn't meet your needs, or if
I can provide additional information or assistance.

Peter
