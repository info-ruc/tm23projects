How are you, hope all is well with you and your family. My name is Mariam Angela Hakin, a girl from Sierra 
Leone, am 21 years old am a house girl by profession, and I have a proposal to make which I believe will 
be helpful to both of us.

Like I told you at the beginning, I am a house help working under a woman who died recently. Before her 
death, she was a very well known diamond merchant in Ghana and Bokinafaso who lived in Sierra 
Leone. My late madam died without having any children or husband.

As a mark of appreciation for working with my Madam for several years, she gave me a will to the tune of 
US$5.5 million which is presently with a security company in Europe with me as the beneficiary. 
 
l am presently living in Sierra Leone while this fund is in Europe, I cannot travel to Europe because of 
difficulty in obtaining a visa moreover I don’t have a bank account where this money can be lodged, this 
is the reason why I have contacted you’ l want you to stand as the beneficiary and help me claim this 
fund from the security company in Europe.

You shall also help me invest this fund in any profitable business in your country or any part of the world 
also intend to come over to continue my education. I have been in contact with the security company; 
they promised to l that they will act on my instructions as soon as am through with my arrangement on 
who can stand as a beneficiary to claim the fund on my behalf.

For your assistance I will offer you 20% for making my dream come true, I will also set aside 10% of the 
total amount for any expenses that will arise during the course of transaction. Please note that all 
documents relating to this transaction is with my late Madams lawyer, I will make them available once you 
indicate your willingness to assist me.

Kindly include your telephone/fax number and other related information about yourself in your reply to 
enable my lawyer call you for more clarification. Please make sure all your replies are directed to my 
private email address mariahakis@netscape.net have a nice day and God bless you.
