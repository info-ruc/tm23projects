>> Dear VIP Cardholders:

>> MBNA Corporation and First Union announced recently that they have entered
into an agreement for MBNA to acquire First Union’s  consumer and commercial
credit card businesses.  MBNA  acquired First Union’s credit card portfolio as
of June 30, 2000.  What this means to MIT is that MBNA will be the new
providing bank for our VIP Purchasing Card.  Although the sale was announced
last summer, the actual conversion to MBNA will not take place until June
2001.  
>> 
>> MBNA is a proven leader in the credit card business and this portfolio sale
should be a seamless transition to MIT.  MBNA promises to continue
providing us
with the same high level of service that we are currently receiving.

>> This change should not affect the use of your card.  You will not have to
replace your existing card, which will remain valid through August of 2003.
>> 
>> You will receive shortly a notice from First Union regarding a Notice of
Change in Terms.  First Union is required to send this notice to all
cardholders directly, even though individuals are not responsible for payment
under the MIT agreement.
>> 
>> As the conversion date approaches, we will keep you updated regarding any
changes that may affect you as a cardholder.
