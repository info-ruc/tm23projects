but the design of the craft has the rtgs out on poles off to one side, with 
the antenna pointed toward earth.  So any thrust would be perpendicular (give

Not if the thermal distribution of the RTGs themselves is asymmetrical.
And it's still just a guess that the RTGs are the source of the
discrepancy, although it's fairly clear that whatever causes this
discrepancy is instrinsic to the spacecraft, since other solar system
objects don't show similar discrepancies.

In any case, I'm wondering just what this ever had to do with
starship-design's real purpose.  Despite clearly stating for years that
this list is NOT for discussing speculative physics, some people just
don't get it.

However Star-ship design does require 'New' ideas as
the old ideas like chemical rockets just don't work on a Galaxy Class
Starship. You are bound to have lots of speculative physics and technology
until somebody builds something.

Myself I have a few Ideas for space travel in general but
I have not found a usable cad system on my budget.( peanuts)
Deep Cold ( Space craft that May have Been ) is good example
of space craft modeling that could be adapted to star-ship design.
http://www.deepcold.com/deepcold/intro_main.html

Then it could be all the people are going after the X-Prize.
Ben.
PS. Has the star-ship design page been updated recently?
I seem to have lost that URL.

There's a difference between speculative physics and speculative
technology.  We know that matter can reach relativistic speeds, although
we don't have the technology to make large objects do so.  We know that
antimatter exists, even though we don't have the technology to
manufacture and store large quantities of it.  It's possible to
characterize a technology to achieve something physically possible based
on those physical limits, even if we don't currently know how to build
that technology.  Conversely, there is nothing in our current
understanding of physics that suggests FTL transport of matter is
possible, and certainly no experimental demonstration of such a thing.

A Radioisotope Thermal Generator.  It's basically a quantity of
radioactive material that generates heat, which is converted to
electrical energy by a thermocouple.  They're long-lasting and have no
moving parts, making them very useful as power sources for long-duration
outer-solar-system space probes.  They've also been somewhat
controversial, as generally the radioactive material used in RTGs is
plutonium (a fairly active radioisotope is needed so that it will
produce enough heat).  Despite substantial care being taken in building
RTG casings so that they will survive any likely launch accident, and
the plutonium contained in a durable ceramic material, there have been
protests surrounding the launches of the Galileo and Cassini spacecraft
due to them carrying RTGs with tens of kilograms of plutonium.

Puzzling hyper-gravity proves weighty mystery
May 21, 2001 Posted: 2:32 p.m. EDT (1832 GMT)
By Richard Stenger, CNN

(CNN) -- An unknown force seeming to pull on a pair of distant space probes
has left astronomers with a weighty mystery, one that appears to defy the
conventional laws of physics.

The Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft, which for decades have steadily
traveled in opposite directions in the solar system, have covered
significantly less space then they should have, astronomers said.

A team of NASA researchers has systematically attempted to determine what
has slowed the sibling NASA robot ships, to no avail.

"Something is slowing down the spacecraft. And we have not been successful
in finding the source of that. There is more slowing than you would expect
from Newtonian gravity," said John Anderson, a senior scientist at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Mystery force a real drag

The probes have traveled far beyond Jupiter since their launch in the early
1970s. But astronomers have been able to measure with great precision the
trajectories and distances of the pair.

Noticing that Pioneer 10 was unexpectedly lagging on its journey away from
the sun, they speculated that an unknown object could been exerting an
influence.

But they had to revise that theory when they realized that a mysterious
force was acting in an identical manner on Pioneer 11, which on the other
side of the system.

"It's the same magnitude and the same direction, namely pointed toward the
sun. The force points to the sun in both cases," said Anderson.

Astronomers studied the Doppler shift of the radio signals to help calculate
the distances of the probes. After extensive analysis, they dismissed
instrumentation error, propellant leaks and minor heat emissions as causes
of the negative thrust.

Perhaps the spacecraft inadvertently produced an unknown force that is not
yet understood, Anderson said. Perhaps scientists will have to reconsider
basic assumptions about the laws of physics.

"No one has come up with a conventional explanation," he said. One possible
reason "is that it is a modification of gravity."

Pioneer sends shocking signal

Launched in the early 1970s, the Pioneers were the first probes to explore
the outer solar system, astounding the world when they sent home flyby
images of giant planets like Jupiter, Saturn and their moons.

The resilient Pioneer 10, now far beyond the orbit of Neptune, surprised
astronomers in April when it managed to send a transmission back to Earth as
directed. Radio communications with Pioneer 11 ceased in 1995.

The scientists were unable to calculate the effects of distant gravity on
other deep space probes, like Voyager I or Voyager 2, because they employ a
different kind of orientation and propulsion system, Anderson said.

Anderson and his colleagues have submitted their work to the journal
Physical Review D. Their findings are currently available on the Internet
scientific archive site of the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

      Solar Windsurfing: The Fastest-Ever Propulsion

      By Robin Lloyd
      Science Editor
      posted: 10:50 am ET
      21 June 2001


      A technology that uses a magnetic balloon to sail ionized particles
shed by the Sun could speed humans to the Jovian moons in less than two
years and push a probe past Voyager 1 to become the first spacecraft beyond
our Solar System.


      The low-cost Mini-Magnetosphere Plasma Propulsion, or M2P2, propels
spacecraft at speeds far greater than today's chemical and even ion
propulsion systems, and its magnetic-field sail would even protect travelers
from deadly solar and Jovian radiation.

      "The technology seeks to do what space does -- deploy a magnetized
sail to travel with the winds," says University of Washington scientist
Robert Winglee, who came up with the idea after 10 years as a geophysicist
studying Earth inside and out to its radiation environment. The Sun is
constantly shedding high-speed particles, called the solar wind, that race
out from it at speeds averaging 800,000 mph (400 km/sec).

      If M2P2 were used for a mission to the Jovian moon Europa, it would
take only 1.5 years to arrive. Using conventional chemical propulsion, such
a trip could take 5 years.

      Other technologies also are designed to sail the solar wind, but they
rely on a lightweight material that could be penetrated by meteors.
Winglee's magnetic fields would operate unperturbed by meteors.

      How it works

      The M2P2 sail starts with an eight-inch magnet that creates a tiny
magnetic field. That field is expanded like a balloon by filling it with an
inert gas split into electrons and ionized particles. That superheated gas,
called plasma, then is amped up by a solenoid that acts as a switch to
create a larger magnetic field.

      The magnetic "balloon" eventually can inflate around a spacecraft to
create magnetic field lines reaching as far as 25 miles (40 kilometers)
across. The solar wind then "blows" against the large bubble to propel the
spacecraft, with the sail acting like an umbrella braced against a bad
storm. Only in this case, the umbrella loses and the spacecraft can put away
up to 4.3 million miles a day.

      The system can make a craft travel at speeds 10 times as fast as the
space shuttle, up to 180,000 mph (50 km/sec). At that rate, an M2P2
spacecraft could catch up with Voyager 1, currently the furthest man-made
object in space at 7.5 billion miles (12 billion kilometers) from Earth,
before it reaches the edge of the Solar System.

      Honors and the new millennium

      Winglee was honored this month by Discover Magazine for his aerospace
innovation, along with seven other inventors.

      SPACE.com Founder Lou Dobbs introduced Winglee at the ceremony,
saying, "This technology may enable us to establish a permanent presence in
space, something existing technologies will not allow us to do."

      There are hopes that M2P2 soon will be used on a couple smaller
experiments or even missions in NASA's New Millennium Program, which focuses
on speeding up space exploration by validating new technologies in flight.

      The tech readiness scale

      Hoppy Price, manager of solar sail tech development at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory, sits on a committee that evaluates technology
proposals for New Millennium missions.

      "It's a neat concept," he said of M2P2. "It has a lot of potential but
it's also very early in the research phase."

      "Most of the solar sail technologies we are looking at now are at tech
readiness level four, which means we have some laboratory demonstrations of
the technology," he said. M2P2 is at a lower level of readiness for the
moment, he said, although fast development of prototypes and testing could
make it available for use in some of the approaching New Millennium
missions, such as Space Technology 7.

This is exactly why it's a bad idea to post HTML mail to the list.

Solar Windsurfing: The Fastest-Ever Propulsion

By Robin Lloyd
Science Editor
posted: 10:50 am ET
21 June 2001


A technology that uses a magnetic balloon to sail ionized particles shed by
the Sun could speed humans to the Jovian moons in less than two years and
push a probe past Voyager 1 to become the first spacecraft beyond our Solar
System.


The low-cost Mini-Magnetosphere Plasma Propulsion, or M2P2, propels
spacecraft at speeds far greater than today's chemical and even ion
propulsion systems, and its magnetic-field sail would even protect travelers
from deadly solar and Jovian radiation.

"The technology seeks to do what space does -- deploy a magnetized sail to
travel with the winds," says University of Washington scientist Robert
Winglee, who came up with the idea after 10 years as a geophysicist studying
Earth inside and out to its radiation environment. The Sun is constantly
shedding high-speed particles, called the solar wind, that race out from it
at speeds averaging 800,000 mph (400 km/sec).

If M2P2 were used for a mission to the Jovian moon Europa, it would take
only 1.5 years to arrive. Using conventional chemical propulsion, such a
trip could take 5 years.

Other technologies also are designed to sail the solar wind, but they rely
on a lightweight material that could be penetrated by meteors. Winglee's
magnetic fields would operate unperturbed by meteors.

How it works

The M2P2 sail starts with an eight-inch magnet that creates a tiny magnetic
field. That field is expanded like a balloon by filling it with an inert gas
split into electrons and ionized particles. That superheated gas, called
plasma, then is amped up by a solenoid that acts as a switch to create a
larger magnetic field.

The magnetic "balloon" eventually can inflate around a spacecraft to create
magnetic field lines reaching as far as 25 miles (40 kilometers) across. The
solar wind then "blows" against the large bubble to propel the spacecraft,
with the sail acting like an umbrella braced against a bad storm. Only in
this case, the umbrella loses and the spacecraft can put away up to 4.3
million miles a day.

The system can make a craft travel at speeds 10 times as fast as the space
shuttle, up to 180,000 mph (50 km/sec). At that rate, an M2P2 spacecraft
could catch up with Voyager 1, currently the furthest man-made object in
space at 7.5 billion miles (12 billion kilometers) from Earth, before it
reaches the edge of the Solar System.

Honors and the new millennium

Winglee was honored this month by Discover Magazine for his aerospace
innovation, along with seven other inventors.

SPACE.com Founder Lou Dobbs introduced Winglee at the ceremony, saying,
"This technology may enable us to establish a permanent presence in space,
something existing technologies will not allow us to do."

There are hopes that M2P2 soon will be used on a couple smaller experiments
or even missions in NASA's New Millennium Program, which focuses on speeding
up space exploration by validating new technologies in flight.

The tech readiness scale

Hoppy Price, manager of solar sail tech development at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, sits on a committee that evaluates technology proposals for New
Millennium missions.

"It's a neat concept," he said of M2P2. "It has a lot of potential but it's
also very early in the research phase."

"Most of the solar sail technologies we are looking at now are at tech
readiness level four, which means we have some laboratory demonstrations of
the technology," he said. M2P2 is at a lower level of readiness for the
moment, he said, although fast development of prototypes and testing could
make it available for use in some of the approaching New Millennium
missions, such as Space Technology 7.
