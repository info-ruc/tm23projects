Far from a great film but interesting in its borrowings is "Devil's
Advocate" with Al Pacino playing the Devil in the guise of lawyer named
John Milton.  I would think students would get a kick out of the actors and
its effects but the notions of free will and sin is an interesting one.

Subject: Re: gay angels


Derek Wood, rebutting "Orpheus," reminds us that "pride" in 17th-century
English could mean "sexual desire" (male or female).  I would add that some
instances occur in a homosexual context, as in Marlowe's *Hero and Leander*,
when Neptune is excited by the sight of naked Leander swimming the
Hellespont:

             With that he stripped him to the ivory skin
             And crying. "Love I come!" leapt lively in.
             Whereat the sapphire-visaged god grew proud.
             And made his capering Triton sound aloud.  (637-40)

"Proud" there surely hints at Neptune's erection, even though stormy seas
might also be called "proud" (OED).

That said, let me say at once that I do NOT think that "pride of Spartan
land" in Fair Infant is nearly so lewd and lavish.  It does not invite us to
visualize a tumescent Apollo or Hyacinthus.  What makes Milton's lines
suggestive, I believe, is their conspicuous absence of any shame or
embarrassment in celebrating male beauty, and in celebrating (nostalgically)
a culture that was uninhibited in its public display and exaltation of such
beauty.

Yes, of course Milton thought of "sodomy" as a crime and a sin.  I have no
quarrel with Larry about Milton's conscious intentions.  Where we part
company is on the question of whether the mythical allusion takes on a life
of its own--one that carries Milton away (though not all the way).  Larry's
comment is most helpful in the way it focusses the issue.  Larry (answering
me) writes:

'"Hyacinthus is the pride of Spartan land in the sense of being Sparta's
most beautiful youth.  Does anyone seriously doubt this?"  No, I do not
doubt this.  What I doubt is that it points toward a secret homosexual
reference and for the reasons I have given.  If, in the midst of a poem
about an infant's tragic death we suddenly are to have inserted into our
heads even a slight picture of homosexual activity, I say that that is
poetically inconsistent and not at all a necessary extrapolation from the
myth Milton is using to other purpose.'

I  agree with Larry that Milton is not making "a secret homosexual
reference."  Milton is not dropping a coded message for those in the know.
He is not (Larry is right to insist) giving us "even a slight picture of
homosexual activity."  But he *is* giving us a not-so-slight picture of
homosexual *love.*  The question is whether this picture is (in Larry's
terms) "poetically inconsistent."  Does it stand out from its context,
attracting attention, or does it blend innocuously in?  I have always found
the Hyacinth lines incongruous in this poem.  Larry disagrees.  He thinks
Hyacinth perfectly appropriate in a poem "about an infant's tragic
death"--even though Hyacinthus was not an infant.

Larry certainly has a case.  An allusion to Hyacinthus need not be out of
place in an elegy that begins "O fairest flower."  But Milton does not use
the myth in quite the way we might expect.  He does not emphasize flowery
pathos.  He never mentions the AI AI on the petals.  He gets distracted.
Instead of petals, we hear of proud beauty, proud Sparta, and Apollo's
"dearly loved mate."  When we do come back to the flower and the infant, the
transition is almost comically pat, like an afterthought:

         Yet art thou not inglorious in thy fate;
         For so Apollo with unweeting hand
         Whilom did slay his dearly-loved mate
         Young Hyacinth born on Eurotas' strand
         Young Hyacinth, the pride of Spartan land;
             But then transformed him to a purple flower
         Alack that so to change thee winter had no power.

The simile takes on a life of its own.  It stands out.  Maybe this can be
explained simply by Milton's fascination with, and love for, ancient Greece.
But then Milton's love of Greece is itself not unrelated to erotic
sensibilities, whether these involve angelic ephebes (th'unarmed youth of
Heav'n, Severe in youthful beauty) or lovely women surpassing Delia's self
in nymph-like step and goddess-like deport.

The question arises:  is Milton's allusion to "Young Hyacinth" tamely
consistent with 17th-century decorum, or is it unusual?  Are references to
Hyacinthus common in the poetry of this period?  And if they are, do they
work like Milton's?  I cannot pronounce confidently on this, but I have had
a quick look at the Chadwyck Healey database for poems published between 600
and 1700.  There are 27 hits for "Hyacinthus", 51 for "Hyacinth."  Most of
these are references to the flower without any mention of the youth.  Those
that do mention the youth, usually mention Apollo, but do so flatly, in a
catalogue of metamorphosed lovers.  William Browne (Britannia's Pastorals,
II 425) is typical:

  Saturne his  Rhea; Jupiter had store,
As  Iö, Leda, Eurõpa, and more;
  Mars entred  Vulcans bed; pertooke his ioy:
  Phoebus had  Daphne, and the sweet-fac'd Boy;
  Venus, Adonis; and the God of  Wit
In chastest bonds was to the  Muses knit

The "sweet-fac'd Boy" is identified as Hyacinth in a marginal note.

There is one notable precedent for Milton's lines--one which almost
certainly prompted Milton's anaphora.  It is Spenser, FQ III vi 45:

And all about grew euery sort of flowre,
     To which sad louers were transformed of yore;
     Fresh Hyacinthus, Phoebus paramoure,
     And dearest love,
     Foolish Narcisse, that likes the watry shore,
     Sad Amaranthus, made a flowre but late,
     Sad Amaranthus, in whose purple gore
     Me seemes I see Amintas wretched fate,
To whom sweet Poets verse hath giuen endlesse date.

I have quoted the stanza as it was printed in 1609.  That was when the
truncated line was first printed.  In 1590 and 1596 the stanza consisted of
only eight lines.  Does anyone know the textual history of this?  Was a line
removed for fear of censorship?  Or did Spenser just nod?  In either case,
why was only a half-line added?  What might rhyme with "yore," "shore" and
"gore"?

To my mind, the Spenser analogue is very important to Milton's Hyacinth.  It
matters whether Hyacinth was a "paramoure" or a "dearest love."  The former
term, printed freely in both earliest editions, carries a burden of
Christian morality.  The latter phrase is much more generous.  Is it too
much to suppose that Milton's "dearly loved mate" is a conscious choice of
"dearest love" over "paramoure"?

Subject:	Angel blush


Dear Norm,

That is a good and legitimate question, whether one is entitled to call 
"Celestial rosy red" a blush, but I think I will stick with my note in the 
Riverside.  Adam's question, about how angels do it (as it was indelicately 
but accurately stated a while back), is something of a rude question, and a 
blush is not necessarily a sign of guilt: it is an unconscious response 
which can indicate everything from outright pleasure to complicity to 
embarrassment.  At PL 8.511, Eve is led "blushing like the morn," and 
surely she is not guilty as Adam leads her to the bower.

I do believe this is Milton being delicately cute, an occasion for the 
reader to laugh out loud to discover that an epic poet can have a sense of 
humor and make fun of angelic behavior.

           I have never been able to understand how easily so many scholars
convert
                   "the Angel with a smile that glow'd
Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue" [VIII, 618-19]

into a "blush," often with discussion that develops the idea that Raphael
is embarrassed by Adam's forthrightness (see, for example, Roy's note in
the Riverside).  But it is a  _smile_ (hardly the usual mark of shame or
discomfort) and, what is more, the color is called  _celestial_  and
identified as the right color for Love.  Are we meant to understand that
blushing is proper for Love?  Or should we think instead of the appearance
of Love overseeing the nuptial bower, joyously erotic and unblushing?

"Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,
Reigns here and revels...." [IV, 763-65]

Can celestial love be less enthusiastic, more conflicted than its earthly
counterpart?  Raphael testifies to the contrary:

"Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st
. . . we enjoy
In eminence, and obstacle find none
Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs...." [VIII, 622-25]

Merely for a record of completeness, I should mention _The
Sentinel_(1977).  It has a half-dozen big-name players, but(as I recall)
was disappointing.  Uses Milton as a gimmick--an ancient priest is (for
approximately eternity) doing Gabriel's job of keeping "strict watch that
to this happy place/No evil thing approach or enter in" [PL, IV, 562-63],
in this case protecting the fallen world from his vantage point at the top
of the house.  The PL lines are actually quoted (apparently to justify the
premise of the film, as if they were written by Nostradamus), but there is
nothing more Miltonic about the film, which remains a weak attempt to
capitalize on the success of _The Exorcist_(1973).

RE: John Leonard's extended defense of Milton's possible allusion to
homosexuality in "Fair Infant"

John's assertion that "meaning can be determined by context" is clearly the
baseline departure for interpretation and one with which I am in complete
agreement.  But I would like to widen his stated context in his dealing with
the poem in view.

Let me agree that Milton is sensitive to male beauty and that he knows the
sexual background John presents us in his handling of the the
Apollo-Hyacinthus section of the poem.  I assert that in order for this to
be read as homosexuality, even glancingly, it would have to have a wider
corresponding context than that John suggests:
	1) The beauty in question is not that of a full-grown male, but of an
infant's.  The corresponding point of Apollo-Hyacinthus cannot therefore be
stressed as to its emphasis on maleness or on relations between males, since
to do so ruins the infant pictured and substitutes an unwarranted beauty
Milton may well have not had in mind.
	2) The more likely correspondence in the Apollo section is to the flower
itself, to its corresponding beauty with that of the infant.  This preserves
the delicate beauty of all other sections in the poem and offers a much
greater correspondence to the overall context of a sad early death.
	3) "Hyacinthus is the pride of Spartan land in the sense of being Sparta's
most beautiful youth.  Does anyone seriously doubt this?"  No, I do not
doubt this.  What I doubt is that it points toward a secret homosexual
reference and for the reasons I have given.  If, in the midst of a poem
about an infant's tragic death we suddenly are to have inserted into our
heads even a slight picture of homosexual activity, I say that that is
poetically inconsistent and not at all a necessary extrapolation from the
myth Milton is using to other purpose.

Larry is obviously right about Adam.  Of course "Hyacinthin Locks" does
not imply homosexuality.  It is an echo of Odyssey 6. 231, where
Odysseus' hair flows like a hyacinth flower.  The reference is probably
to colour.

But the case is different in the lines I quoted from Fair Infant.  Here
the reference is most certainly to Apollo's love for the beautiful youth
Hyacinthus.  Lest anyone doubt this, let me cite the lines in context:

		Yet art thou not inglorious in thy fate;
		For so Apollo, with unweeting hand
		Whilom did slay his dearly-loved mate
		Young Hyacinth born on Eurotas strand
		Young Hyacinth the pride of Spartan land.

"Mate" there might mean nothing more than "companion" (as when Satan
calls to his "neerest Mate"), but the other sense "lover, paramour" did
exist and is attested in 17th century English (see OED).  Hyacinth was
Apollo's mate in both senses ("G'day mate").  Milton does not spell this
out ("dearly-loved" is not conclusive), but the lines are suggestive.

Now to "pride."  "Orpheus" ("Woods and Rocks had Eares to rap-to-ya")
rightly takes me to task for my rash comment that "pride" might have
something of its modern gay resonance.  He mockingly suggests that the
real reference is to a pride of lions.  I think most of us would agree
that "pride" here means "the prime; the flower"(OED 9a) and that
Hyacinthus is the pride of Spartan land in the sense of being Sparta's
most beautiful youth.  Does anyone seriously doubt this?

My point in drawing (an admittedly inept) comparison with the modern gay
use of "pride" was that Milton's "pride" also has a social dimension.
The reference is not only to Hyacinthus's beauty, but to the Spartan
festival of the Hyacinthia in which ephebes would sing praises to
Apollo. I still think that this is plausible, even probable. Milton
would have known about Spartan festivals, which are described by
Plutarch and Xenophon, among others.

None of this proves anything about Milton's sexual preferences.  Let me
be clear:  I have no doubt whatever that Milton always liked women.  But
there are many hints in the poems that he was also sensitive to male
beauty.  Maybe I am wrong about this, but I am not wrong for the reason
Larry gives.  My point about "Young Hyacinth" is not demolished just
because Larry can quote another reference to Hyacinth which is clearly
free from homoerotic associations.  The erotic and social nuances of
"pride" are not cancelled just because "Orpheus" reminds us that we can
speak of a pride of lions.  Yes, signs are iterable, but meaning can be
determined by context.  In the lines from "Fair Infant", Young Hyacinth
is the Hyacinthus loved by Apollo.  He is the "pride of Spartan land"
because of his beauty, and because his fate is commemorated in public
festivals.

Milton could hardly have been insensitive to its contemporary sexual
resonance especially when writing of a "dearly loved mate." A recent
copy of the Oxford alumni magazine, in all its Oxonian innocence, had an
article entitled in  huge, bold type, "GOING DOWN," not a likely
headline in a North American journal. Milton had read Shakespeare's
                                   flesh stays no farther reason
         But rising at thy name doth point out thee
         As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
         He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
         To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
         No want of conscience hold it that I call
         Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.
In Lucrece, 'The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace.' Its
less fleshly but still carnal sense was common: in Othello's 'as hot as
monkeys, As salt as wolves in pride...,' or Boyet's 'Proud with his
form, in his eye pride expressed,' or the  Dark Lady's 'foul pride'
which aimed to get 'one angel in another's hell.'  In his History,
Milton writes of  'Danish Insolencies' of  'thir pride, thir ravishing
of Matrons and Virgins' (CP 5: 340) and and in Of True Religion, he
thunders against the nation's depravity, its 'Pride, Luxury,
Drunkenness, Whoredom' (CP 8: 438) where the sexual overtones seem
important. The Oxford journalist was innocent of the North American
resonance of her phrase; Milton was surely aware of the resonance of his
in an allusion to male love.

I missed the origin of this thread, but I wanted to mention that a fellow
TA had some success teaching PL with the original Star Trek episode "Space
Seed" as part of his early Brit. Lit. survey.  In this episode, Khan
(Ricardo Mantalban), an escaped, genetically engineered totalitarian leader
from "Earth's Third World War" wakes from suspendend animation and tries to
take over the Enterprise.  Kirk's misquoting of Milton: "better to rule in
hell than serve in heaven" tips off the viewer that Khan is modelled on
Satan in Books I&II.  Although today's undergraduate students might not be
as familiar with classic Star Trek as their predecessors, it is a good
teaching opportunity and a great Miltonic moment in pop culture.

The recent film The Loss of Sexual Innocence, directed
by Mike Figgis, is interesting in its own right, if at
times pretentious, and reimagines provocatively both
Eve's birth scene and the final moments of the poem
(Adam and Eve are driven out of their paradisal park
by police and barking dogs, only to be surrounded by
oglers and paparazzi as they struggle to pull on their
clothes.)  I've taught these scenes once, and the
students were able to do some wonderful work with
them.  The only hitch is there is nudity, so the
appropriateness would, as always, depend on the
audience.

Dear Bill,

Of course you are right to object on the principle that I should argue from

It would be sloppy and irresponsible of me to do so. And if I could locate

That point acknowledged, I must return to your online statement regarding

populated by actively gay angels."  It seems to me that on the face of these
words of yours I have not been unfair in responding as I have.

You use the modern word "gay," with its associated modern denotation, and do
so knowing that it conjures a heaven of millions upon millions of copulating
angels backsiding one another in rapturous orgiastic joy before the throne
of Milton's holy God.  This is not, of course, how Milton puts angelic
relations through Raphael, but it is how we may fairly take your assertion
of angelic gayety.  If angels have sex, are all males, and are all gay, how
else are we to take your assertion but in our modern sense?

It is to your insertion of modern gayness into Milton's epic that I do alone
object, however else you wish to take Raphael's response to Adam (PL
8.618-30) or other evidence.  I reassert my central point made in my
previous post: The Bible is Milton's very warrant to breathe, since it is
from God; and in it God utterly denounces homosexual and lesbian sex (Lev
20:13; Rom 1:26-27, to name but two passages). He would not willingly
contradict it, nor could he possibly have made a mistake in speaking as he
has of angelic sex.

As you have called upon me and others to consider your evidence, so I would
return the same charge to you regarding Milton's life and high regard for
the Bible as the center of his existence and practices. If we ignore this
Milton and instead take your lead and posit a gay heaven, we must perforce
posit a winking, leering Milton laughing at his own sardonic joke on us.

Is there some other word besides "gay" that you would now wish to substitute
in your online  statement to clarify your remarks?  If not, and you wish to
still stand by this word as a fair assertion of Milton's intentions
regarding angelic sex, then I would ask you why it is that Milton would so
utterly degrade his own grand argument to "justifie the wayes of God to men"
by fielding legions of lecherous angels, knowing well, as he did, that he
had no Biblical warrant to do so and that his own readers would condemn all
of his efforts to defend a God who would put up with the practice?  His holy
God could not in this event possibly judge Adam and Eve for fruit-picking
when his own good angels are degrading themselves before his very throne of
dazzling holy light.

I conclude, then, by saying that to me your remarks online appear
anachronistic since they make Milton an advocate of a practice foreign to
his Bible, foreign to England's laws, and foreign to the stated logic of
Paradise Lost itself to vindicate a holy God.

I must admit, however, that I cannot tell from your brief online comment
whether you mean "gay" in our sense absolutely or whether in twinkling
merriment from an extrapolation you were making of some article where you
may have spoken in more guarded terms.

While I'll admit that  _South Park, The Movie: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut_  is
NOT the usual sort of film shown in classrooms, Trey Parker and Matt Stone
constructed a wonderfully Miltonesque song for their animated Satan in which
he longs to be a part of the world "Up There."

Other themes currently of interest to the list, namely daemonic sexuality,
are also explored in this character with real irreverence and very little

I wonder if this discussion is not missing the humor of the relevant moment
in _PL_ and the ineffability of the subject in question. Raphael, list
members will recall, is induced to speak of angelic sexuality only after
having scolded Adam, perhaps excessively, for the latter's susceptibility to
passion. Adam offers a gentle correction to Raphael's correction, followed
by the smooth and surprising counter-inquiry "how do you guys do it" (in so
many words). As far as I can tell this is the only instance in Adam's two
long tutorials (with Raphael and Michael) where the student really turns the
tables on the teacher, putting him off balance and allowing the paradisal
colloquy to be momentarily travestied. How do we know it is travestied?
Because the angel, "inhabitant with God," _blushes_. He then begins his
answer with "Suffice thou think us happy," a typical Miltonic
erasure-in-advance: it is not really possible to "say," even in UNfallen
earthly terms, whether/how "angels" have "sex." The classical homosocial
vision R then offers is, in part, a sign of its own insufficiency.

Some questions to come out of various comments on the performance at the 
Folger:

Should Comus be a dirty old man, a suave seducer, or a flirtatious and 
perhaps even tipsy Bacchus?

Should the ugly-headed monsters be dirty dancers?

Should the aristocrats in the audience join in the dance, somehow?

Should the audience laugh, at any point?

Should Comus even be allowed to take a bow at the end?  After all, isn't he 
banished?  Isn't he evil?  Isn't he socially beneath the 
Bridgewaters?  Shouldn't he just get the hell out of there?

Is it wrong to call the Attendant Spirit the Demon, at least with a modern 
audience who might have a hard time with "daimon" or "genius loci"?  How 
about Thyrsis (Sara Vandenburg's silent correction) or just Attendant 
Spirit?  Isn't he a kind of Platonic angel?

NB.  Always be suspicious when someone prefaces a statement with "in fact".
Beware the rhetoric!

Carrol, how can you say this ("no one was ever") in the very same message in
which you append my quotation from Plato's Symposium?  Did you read the
passage?  Aristophanes clearly does distinguish four categories (men who
like men, women who like women, women who etc).  These are not just
"specific acts."  Aristophanes is talking about sexual preferences.  It is
powerful dogma indeed that can blind critics to the evidence under their
noses.

But maybe your point is that sexual preferences were not "social" until
modern times.  You continue:

 > While the OED doesn't support this (or negate it) I would say that
 > "sodomist" named a person who had committed a specific act, not someone

 >

This antithesis is very rough and ready:  either "a specific act" (as in
"anyone fancy a bit of sodomy today?") or "someone whose role in the world
was defined by that one restricted area of his activity."  Can't there be
something in between?  Would *any* gay person, even today, appreciate being
told that his (if it is not her) whole "role in the world [is] defined by
that one restricted area of his activity"?  ("Hey, Bart, how's it going,
buddy?  How's the gaiety, mate?  Your 'role in the world still defined by
that one restricted area of your activity?'").  When you define the terms as
crudely as that, of course they will fail to fit (mercifully).

The point is that people can have consistent sexual preferences even when
these are unattached to a particular social culture or sub-culture.  This is
especially true of previous centuries, when anti-sodomy laws inhibited the
public expression of forbidden sexual preferences.  But one can make the
case more strongly than this.  Despite the anti-sodomy laws (and maybe even
because of them), same-sex love *was* associated with particular
institutions in earlier centuries.  Witness the Knights Templar.  This once
proud order was crushed in the early 14th-century (its Grand Master burned
at the stake) because it was deemed to have practised and nurtured "the
'sodomist lifestyle.'"  Whether or not the charges were founded (and some
historians think they were), the fact that they were *deemed* to be
well-founded is significant for our argument.  And, yes, "sodomy" in this
context did mean men loving men.  Even the word "bugger" (from French
*bougre*) originally identified a social group--though one which once had a
wider role in the world than that "one restricted area" to which they have
bequeathed their name.

Subject:	RE: gay angels? -- Hardly!!

Dear Scott,

At the risk of writing a response that will appear overly scholastic, I
think one can safely assume that Aquinas would reject sexuality in the
angelic chorus for the following reasons:

1. Matter is the principle of individuation for Aquinas. An angel, however,
is uninvolved with matter according to Aquinas; it has a formal but not a
material cause. Therefore, Aquinas holds that there can be no species of
angels. Every angel is a species of one.

2. a. "Sensation is entirely a vital function. Consequently it can in no way
be said that the angels perceive through the organs of their assumed bodies.
Yet such bodies are not fashioned in vain; for they are not fashioned for
the purpose of sensation through them, but to this end, that by such bodily
organs the spiritual powers of the angels may be made manifest; just as by
the eye the power of the angel's knowledge is pointed out, and other powers
by the other members, as Dionysius teaches (Coel. Hier.)"

b. "Properly speaking, the angels cannot be said to eat, because eating
involves the taking of food convertible into the substance of the eater."

c. "As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xv): "Many persons affirm that they have
had the experience, or have heard from such as have experienced it, that the
Satyrs and Fauns, whom the common folk call incubi, have often presented
themselves before women, and have sought and procured intercourse with them.
Hence it is folly to deny it. But God's holy angels could not fall in such
fashion before the deluge. Hence by the sons of God are to be understood the
sons of Seth, who were good; while by the daughters of men the Scripture
designates those who sprang from the race of Cain. Nor is it to be wondered
at that giants should be born of them; for they were not all giants, albeit
there were many more before than after the deluge." Still if some are
occasionally begotten from demons, it is not from the seed of such demons,
nor from their assumed bodies, but from the seed of men taken for the
purpose; as when the demon assumes first the form of a woman, and afterwards
of a man; just as they take the seed of other things for other generating
purposes, as Augustine says (De Trin. iii), so that the person born is not
the child of a demon, but of a man." (ST Ia, 51, 3)

3. "I answer that, As the Philosopher says (Rhet. i, 11), "concupiscence is
a craving for that which is pleasant." Now pleasure is twofold, as we shall
state later on (31, 3,4): one is in the intelligible good, which is the good
of reason; the other is in good perceptible to the senses. The former
pleasure seems to belong to soul alone: whereas the latter belongs to both
soul and body: because the sense is a power seated in a bodily organ:
wherefore sensible good is the good of the whole composite. Now
concupiscence seems to be the craving for this latter pleasure, since it
belongs to the united soul and body, as is implied by the Latin word
"concupiscentia." Therefore, properly speaking, concupiscence is in the
sensitive appetite, and in the concupiscible faculty, which takes its name
from it."(ST Ia, IIae, 30, 1)


Given #1, sexuality would involve sexuality of different species, unlikely
to be endorsed given Aquinas's view on natural law.

Given #2, regarding angelic "bodies," and #3, regarding human concupiscence,
desire for sexual union seems difficult to comprehend. One needs a body to
feel sexual desire, and, according to Aquinas, angels don't really have
bodies.

In short, Milton's understanding of the angels is a sharp departure from the
tradition of Aquinas.

Dear List:

It would be interesting to see if anyone can come up with responses to my
query about Aquinas' views about angels experiencing natural love (of either
orientation?!), and what this could mean as a context for Milton's views
about angelic behavior.

Now the fallen angels of course had sexual urges and acted upon them
(Biblical references, Old Testament Pseudipigrapha (Books of Adam and Eve),
the Midrash on Genesis, and then there is Byron's incomplete play Heaven and
Earth (which, incidentally has some wonderful lyrical choric passages)), so
would this imply that in their unfallen state they perhaps had natural love,
but love free from concupiscence?

Try it this way. Many people today eat ice cream cones -- but there is
no social category of "cone-eaters." Many people in the past had sexual
relations both with the opposite sex and with their own sex but there
was no social category of bisexuals. Many people in the past had sexual
relations only with the opposite sex, but neither they nor others
thought of them as heterosexuals -- in fact, no one was ever a
heterosexual until homosexuals became a recognized social category.
While the OED doesn't support this (or negate it) I would say that
"sodomist" named a person who had committed a specific act, not someone
whose role in the world was defined by that one restricted area of his
activity. No one could speak of the "sodomist lifestyle."

Incidentally, if angelic sex consists of complete interpenetration, how
could one tell "gay sex" from "heterosex," since neither would involve
distinct organs? And in any case, the most interesting feature of
angelic sex is that it suggests that Milton's angels like Dickens's
Londoners were abstract individuals who had private lives independently
of the heavenly chorus. It is rather difficult to imagine Dante's angels
even having a private conversation or going on a sightseeing tour, let
alone having sex.

Subject:	Re: Performance of masque at Folger

I was fortunate enough to attend the performance of Comus and the 
conference the
next day.

I had never seen a performance of the masque before, although I had seen 
several
performances of various Jonsonian masques.

The costumes were all in the same fabric--a fortuny-like pleated iridescent 
fabric
in different colors.  The choice was not entirely flattering to several of the
characters, especially the actor who played Thyrsis.  He was probably the least
successful cast member.  Several people commented that he did not speak 
verse very
well.  However, I came away thinking that Milton's expository blank verse 
at the
beginning of the masque was clearer narrative than it seems when I read it
silently.

The Lady was a very appealing young woman who looked the part, and who 
spoke the
verse feelingly.  She was not, however, effective in the song to Echo.

The actor who played Comus didn't seem "slimy" to me, and in fact there was 
some
controversy during the conference about how that part should be played.  Most
people thought he should seem (and was, in this case) clever and seductive.

The two brothers seemed quite good, at least to me.  They were strapping young
men, obviously too old for the part, but were able to differentiate their
positions during their dialogue.

The best moment in Thyrsis's portrayal came when he acted "like a typical 
teacher"
and criticized the brothers for not capturing Comus and breaking his 
wand.  He was
appropriately annoyed.

The singer who played Sabrina was the most overwhelming voice, and I know that
several local audience members were there especially to hear her.

The Washington Post article mocked the performance as a kind of Miltonic 
sitcom.
I don't think the review was fair.  There was laughter, but I think there 
probably
was in Milton's day as well.  There were one or two moments of humor that were
intended by the cast, and that people remarked as novel (e.g., a comic 
emphasis on
the word "mud"--check it out in the text).

There was quite a bit of discussion about the dancing.  At the beginning, 
Comus's
group had animal heads and were quite lascivious.

The director spoke the next day about the dances that ended the masque.
He decided not to end the masque with any dance involving the audience 
(e.g., by
"planting" dancers in the audience who could be brought up on stage).  Instead,
one of the female dancers "flirted" with the Younger Brother and drew him 
into the
dance.  That move seemed quite effective to me.  More controversial was the
decision to bring Comus on stage to join the dancers as the Lady's partner.

The musicians seemed excellent to me, and I was glad to hear Lawes' music 
played
on historical instruments. The musicians sat in the gallery above the stage.

Subject:	Re: Paradise Lost and films?


For those of us interested in movies AND Paradise Lost, there are slim 
pickings for purposes of comparison--and probably more of the pickings from 
very early, silent movies than from later work.  Eisenstein's great silent 
movies, especially Alexander Nevsky (get a good print with the Prokofiev 
music well-synched) and Battleship Potemkin, are works of art directly 
related to PL (there was an article by Sidney Gottlieb in MQ many years ago 
that quoted from Eisenstein's essays on montage in epic poetry and epic 
film).  D. W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, and Judith of 
Bethulia also try to do in epic film what Milton did in poetry.

Images of innocent Adam and Eve types swimming in clear streams naked don't 
usually work as well as the pre-Fall images in PL.  The Lord of the Flies 
movie might be better, to show naivete evolving into devil-worship.  Try 
Nicholas Roeg's Walkabout as well, for images of childhood innocence, 
primitive joy with nature, and adult corruption.

Satan images in cartoons and movies do generally work, from Disney's 
immense bat-winged Lucifer in Fantasia to Ursula the Sea Witch (very like 
Milton's Sin but also Satanic as she dilates) in The Little Mermaid.  (I 
wrote an article about Ursula as a postmodern recreation of Sin as in the 
1699 illustrations for PL, but it was scheduled for the ill-fated volume in 
memory of Georgia Christopher.)  There are also Satanic seducers, from 
Louise Brooks's great seductress in Pandora's Box to Al Pacino's "Milton" 
the lawyer in The Devil's Advocate.   There is Seven, a pretty nasty horror 
mystery built on the seven deadly sins and on Milton (I think he is at 
least quoted in the movie).  And both Robert de Niro and Mickey Rourke have 
played Satan figures.  For sheer evil, check Robert Mitchum's wonderful 
preacher/murderer in Charles Laughton's only movie, Night of the Hunter or, 
for that matter, his sadistic killer seducer who won't die in Cape Fear.

Come to think of it, the films that at least run parallel to Paradise Lost 
in plot, characterization, and theme are a fairly rich group.

illuminate Paradise Lost in the classroom.  Next week, I'll show my students
a portion of Triumph of the Will (1935), with Hitler presiding over the

Indeed. Hence in Stoppard's *The Invention of Love*, Housman is outraged at
this monstrous coinage that's half Greek and half Latin.

People might be interested in the following link:

http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1395rykener.html

It's a legal document concerning John Rykener, a 14th century male
transvestite prostitute. While at Oxford, he slept
with three scholars who later adamantly maintained that they were unaware of
his real gender. "This case stands not only as a rare source for the history
of tranvestite and homosexually active people in late  Medieval England, but
as evidence of the suppression of that history by scholarly historians in
the 19th and 20th centuries."

If terms like 'gay' and 'straight' are merely modern concepts, I'd be
grateful if someone could explain what the following is doing in my
*Riverside Chaucer*:

"Recent critics have tended to see him [The Pardoner] as a homosexual
(McAlpine, PMLA 95, 1980, 8-22), who, unlike the eunuch, was a frequent
figure of medieval satire (Mann, Ch and Estates, 145-48). In two mutually
supporting articles in Mediaevalia 1985 (for 1982), C.D. Benson and R.F.
Green present a strong case for the idea that the Pardoner is an effeminate
heterosexual like Absolon in the Miller's Tale." (p. 824).

I've been thinking of showing Kevin Smith's _Dogma_ (1999) in a Milton
class. There is a scene where one of the two banished angels justifies his
decision to go through a desperate scheme to get back to heaven (even
though it would result in the paradox of God being wrong and so would wipe
out all existence).  He rails against God for creating humans with free
will even though humans don't deserve it since they keep sinning, while
angels are created only to praise even though they're superior.  I can't
remember it exactly, but he sounds like Milton's Satan.  The other angel
points out to him that he's starting to sound like Lucifer when he fell.
It's a fun movie, mocking Catholicism in a way only a former Catholic can,
and I think a good example of a modern popular treatment of the same
subject.

Yes, I think Biblical fundamentalism is absolutely the governing philosophy

against divorce.  And no doubt Milton would have embraced as well the 
identification of a few loose remarks in the Old Testament with "the will 
of God."  In fact, it explains his wholesale rejection of the New 
Testament, so fraught with contradictions and ambiguities--all those weird 
parables--as opposed to the plainly visible will of God as expressed in the 
never-ambiguous Old Testament.  I believe it was Milton's understanding of 
the Kingdom of the Jews under David and Solomon that led him to embrace the 
subordination of the church to the state, the legitimacy of absolutist 
government, and the practice of polygamy.  Milton was always a strong 
defender of fundamentals.

How about that crazy film that came out recently--what was it called--about
the two fallen angels who are trying to slip back into heaven through a

heavily and shed some interesting light on why we tend to sympathize with

Tim--it seems to me you are trying for visual analogues, but I have found
that the Star Wars trilogy, which students frequently already know well, is
very useful for discussing Paradise Lost, both as epic and as stylistic
extravaganza.

Although it is not a poem, it is long, narrative, addresses "a great and
serious subject, related in an elevated style, and centered on a heroic or
quasi-divine
figure on whose actions depend" the fate of the whole galaxy (quotations
courtesy of M H Abrams).  Like epic, it begins "in medias res," with both
Obi Wan Kenobi and Yoda filling in the background.  Luke visiting Yoda to
learn about the past and his place in history parallels Adam's conversation
with Raphael nicely.  The setting is cosmic, the conflict superhuman, the
intervention of the gods embodied in the Force.

Certainly Spielberg pulled out all the stops in using state of the art
cinematography--and his redoing everything now that technology has improved
demonstrates his commitment to having the trilogy be as fancy as possible.

As I've said before on the list, students do a good job when asked to
decide how to film Books 6 and 7 (I do this in class on two separate days,
with each group of students being giving particular moments in the
action--they go for claymation, animation, digital imaging, time-lapse
--they are far more visually sophisticated and imaginative than I am).

Good luck--Margie

Dear List:

It would be interesting to see if anyone can come up with responses to my
query about Aquinas' views about angels experiencing natural love (of either
orientation?!), and what this could mean as a context for Milton's views
about angelic behavior.

Now the fallen angels of course had sexual urges and acted upon them
(Biblical references, Old Testament Pseudipigrapha (Books of Adam and Eve),
the Midrash on Genesis, and then there is Byron's incomplete play Heaven and
Earth (which, incidentally has some wonderful lyrical choric passages)), so
would this imply that in their unfallen state they perhaps had natural love,
but love free from concupiscence?

Larry is obviously right about Adam.  Of course "Hyacinthin Locks" does
not imply homosexuality.  It is an echo of Odyssey 6. 231, where
Odysseus' hair flows like a hyacinth flower.  The reference is probably
to colour.

But the case is different in the lines I quoted from Fair Infant.  Here
the reference is most certainly to Apollo's love for the beautiful youth
Hyacinthus.  Lest anyone doubt this, let me cite the lines in context:

		Yet art thou not inglorious in thy fate;
		For so Apollo, with unweeting hand
		Whilom did slay his dearly-loved mate
		Young Hyacinth born on Eurotas strand
		Young Hyacinth the pride of Spartan land.

"Mate" there might mean nothing more than "companion" (as when Satan
calls to his "neerest Mate"), but the other sense "lover, paramour" did
exist and is attested in 17th century English (see OED).  Hyacinth was
Apollo's mate in both senses ("G'day mate").  Milton does not spell this
out ("dearly-loved" is not conclusive), but the lines are suggestive.

Now to "pride."  "Orpheus" ("Woods and Rocks had Eares to rap-to-ya")
rightly takes me to task for my rash comment that "pride" might have
something of its modern gay resonance.  He mockingly suggests that the
real reference is to a pride of lions.  I think most of us would agree
that "pride" here means "the prime; the flower"(OED 9a) and that
Hyacinthus is the pride of Spartan land in the sense of being Sparta's
most beautiful youth.  Does anyone seriously doubt this?

My point in drawing (an admittedly inept) comparison with the modern gay
use of "pride" was that Milton's "pride" also has a social dimension.
The reference is not only to Hyacinthus's beauty, but to the Spartan
festival of the Hyacinthia in which ephebes would sing praises to
Apollo. I still think that this is plausible, even probable. Milton
would have known about Spartan festivals, which are described by
Plutarch and Xenophon, among others.

None of this proves anything about Milton's sexual preferences.  Let me
be clear:  I have no doubt whatever that Milton always liked women.  But
there are many hints in the poems that he was also sensitive to male
beauty.  Maybe I am wrong about this, but I am not wrong for the reason
Larry gives.  My point about "Young Hyacinth" is not demolished just
because Larry can quote another reference to Hyacinth which is clearly
free from homoerotic associations.  The erotic and social nuances of
"pride" are not cancelled just because "Orpheus" reminds us that we can
speak of a pride of lions.  Yes, signs are iterable, but meaning can be
determined by context.  In the lines from "Fair Infant", Young Hyacinth
is the Hyacinthus loved by Apollo.  He is the "pride of Spartan land"
because of his beauty, and because his fate is commemorated in public
festivals.

Subject:	Re: Performance of masque at Folger

Not having seen "A Masque"" before this performance, and hence having
eyes not so jaded as Roy reports his, I offer the following thoughts.

One thing that the Folger production brought out for me was the very
great difficulty of finding modern performers who can manage all that
the masque requires -- more, I note, than other court masques of the
period. Jones' court masques hardly ever required performers to do
more than two of three things -- speak, sing, dance. But the Lady,
in particular, must be adept at all three: her verse is complex and
periodic, she has a tough song to sing, involving difficult
intervals, and she has to dance.  Whether Alice Egerton were any good
at all these we don't know, but then her audience was probably an
indulgent one.  On a modern stage, the order is a tall one, as it is
also for the Demon.

The Folger production chose to emphasize the text -- indisputably the
right choice in the circumstances, I think. Richard Clifford's Comus,
an aristocratic sybarite of mellifluous tonal register and exquisite
vocal control (and deliciously curly Oriental slippers) was the glue
that held the piece together. His Lady looked good and spoke well.
Her singing was less reliable. The hard work in limited time he and
his cast had done on the text mostly paid off, though it exposed the
very different kinds of vocal training the English and American
theater traditions afford.  Costuming was vivid, in bright colors,
and with some charming animal heads on the rout. Setting was minimal,
with only some patterned drops, and a roll-out float for Sabrina and
her attendants (the thought "Miss Shropshire" passed through my
mind).  The dancing was accurate and well-choreographed, though there
was only one country-dance where I would have preferred several, and
a few more bodies would have been livelier. The music was excellent,
its presence emphasized by an opening "Overture".

Given limited resources of time and expertise, I thought it a very
creditable production.  Improvement would probably have cost more
than any company has at its disposal for a piece of very limited
appeal to a modern audience.

The argument that what we now call "sexual orientation" (horrible term)
did not exist in previous epochs is very fashionable these days, as is
the argument that our ancestors did not think of themselves as "the
subject."  This is obviously a huge and complex topic, and I have no
wish to get into it.  I readily agree that the *terms* were different,
and had different nuances.  But the idea that our ancestors did not have
sexual preferences--that rings false to me.  Remember censorship!  It
would be a brave homosexual/sodomite (what you will) who opened his
heart and mouth in renaissance Europe.  But Greece is different. Those
who think that the notion of sexual preference was unknown before the
20th century should re-read Aristophanes's speech in Plato's Symposium
(191-192). Aristophanes very clearly divides the human race into four
groups:

1) "Men who are . . . lovers of women"
2) "women who lust after men"
3) "women who have . . . female attachments"
4) "they who are a section of the male . . . and hang about men"
(trans. Jowett 318)

There are differences from today.  Aristophanes's groups 1 and 2 are
specifically called "adulterers" (one wonders how, and whether, marriage
fits into this scheme).  But Plato clearly was aware that some men like
women, some men like men, some women like women, some women like men.
This sounds rather like "modern categories of sexuality" to me.

Hello Stella

A former student of mine sent me this account of the masque. (There was
also a harsh review in the Washington Post, it seems, perhaps for march 24.)

I forgot to tell you about the one thing I most wanted to
tell you about. I saw Comus at the Folger Shakespeare Theatre last Saturday! I
bet you're fiercely jealous. I must say that it was by far the best Comus I've
ever seen. But at the same time, it was also by far the worst Comus I've ever
seen. It was quite amateurish (as it should be, you may think, since it would
originally have been performed by amateurs), most actors fighting a losing
battle
with Milton's beautiful language. Sabrina, by contrast, was rather too much
of a
professional, a heroine with an operatic voice straight out of a Wagner opera
(Brünhilde!). It was quite comic. Predictably, the theme of chastity raised
more
laughs than Milton intended which didn't make the actors' job any easier.
Disappointingly, there was rather less music and dancing than I had
expected. All
in all, having gotten free tickets, I quite enjoyed the spectacle despite its
flaws, but those who bought tickets for $35 or $40 understandably felt
somewhat
cheated.

This is certainly one possible construction of the evidence, and perhaps
the most plausible one.  But might not Milton also allow room for
heterosexual (and lesbian) angels when he writes: "Spirits when they
please / Can either sex assume or both" (I 423-44)?  Or does "Spirits"
here refer exclusively to devils?

The question of homosexuality (or bisexuality) in Milton is
fascinating.  One possible piece of evidence often overlooked is this,
from "Fair infant":

Young Hyacinth, born on Eurotas' strand
Young Hyacinth, the pride of Spartan land.


The allusion might not be *only* to the myth (suggestive in itself), but
also to the Spartan Hyacinthia, a festival in Apollo's honour, in which
here handsome boys played a conspicuous part.  Homosexuality was a way
of life in Sparta.  "Pride" here might even have something like its
modern gay resonance.

Subject:	Re: the sexuality of angels


Dear Listers:

I checked out www.raphael.net which contains Aquinas' teaching on angels (I
decided to hit upon a primary source in this discussion, though the book
Milton and the Angels a fellow lister cited is definitely looming on my
reading list). From what I gather from my limited exposure to the text at
this point, he seems to conclude they are incorporeal substances (spiritual
bodies?) who also experience a natural love. How can one therefore conclude
they experience sexuality? He does conclude that they can experience natural
affection between each other, but does this mean and/or include sexual
interactions in the physical, corporeal sense?

This is obviously a complex issue which I probably have misunderstood from
the beginning, so pardon my ignorance.

Subject:	Faulkner and Comus


Our Faulkner specialist here has asked me to pass along a query.  He is
editing an odd short story by Faulkner which makes passing reference to
"Comus' second speech," but finds of course that the _Masque_ has more
than two lengthy passages spoken by Comus.  He is thinking that in
Faulkner's time (1920s through 50s, I imagine), the term "Comus' second
speech" had a very clear referent, now lost.  Can anyone help?

Subject:	Re: New Critical Mythologies

Satan pictured as James and Charles may refer to the 1688 edition of
Paradise Lost.  The edition, edited by Tonson, has been viewed by some as a
political statement against Charles.  First, the timing is suggestive, on
the eve of the Glorious Revolution.  Secondly, Satan in the first
illustration apparently resembles a statue of James II that was near
Whitehall (placed 1686).

See Estella Schoenburg, "The Face of Satan, 1688" in _Ringing the Bell
Backward_ (1982) and Shawcross, "The First Illustrations for Paradise Lost"
in Milton Quarterly 9 (1975).  For further discussion, see Suzanne Boorsch
and Mary D. Ravenhall's articles on the political connections.

On the other hand, it might just mean pride as  in a pride of lions.

Subject:	Re: Performance of masque at Folger


Any one review of the performance of the masque at the Folger would 
probably disagree with all others, about actors, dancers, musicians, 
costumes, lighting, choreography.  Most of the members of the audience, I 
am sure, were just glad to have an opportunity to see a performance of a 
work so rarely performed.  Stella Revard has probably seen more 
performances than anyone else, with about six, and I have seen at least 
five--one at Rochester (Sixties), one at Syracuse (Seventies), one at 
Cambridge (early Eighties), and the one at the Folger.  Stella, I know, 
likes a public performance she saw at Ludlow, in the castle, but that's one 
I haven't seen, and there was the off-central-London performance that 
Margaret Arnold just mentioned, and I didn't see that either.

A director has several important choices: should Comus be played as a young 
Bacchus, dripping odors, dripping wine, with curly locks, or should he be a 
dirty old man, unctuous or slimy?  Traditionally, anyone kin to Bacchus 
should be a belly-god, and Stephen Orgel showed the one prior English 
(Inigo Jones) Comus as a fat naked Bacchus-type.

The Folger director, Richard Clifford, casting himself in the role of 
Comus, had to present a slender, suave, middle-aged Comus, inclining toward 
the slimy rather than the overweight.

Another important choice is whether to present the principal actors as 
static, operatic characters at lecterns, or whether to make them memorize 
their lines and move about the stage.  Because of thrift, the Folger actors 
read their lines from the lecterns: they weren't off-book yet.  This choice 
means the difference between a Broadway musical masque and an oratorio in 
which the actors say or sing their lines from one fixed position.

The reviewer from the Washington Post called the performance a Milton 
soap-opera, which was unkind, but he did commend the clear reading of the 
lines (this was amazing: from the rear of the Folger theater, the famous 
reconstruction of the Globe, I could hear every word); the music of Henry 
Lawes and others played by the highly professional Folger Consort led by 
Robert Eisenstein; and the period dancing choreographed by Julie 
Andrijeski.  The singing was one-third professional (Sabrina, as sung by 
Rosa Lamoreaux), and two-thirds proficient (everyone else hit the notes on 
schedule).

I was a jaded viewer, having seen the work performed so often in the last 
thirty years, so my opinion of what Comus should look like, or what 
movement is necessary, or what color or texture the costumes should be, was 
also jaded.

It might be more interesting to have some first-time viewers give their 
impressions of what they saw.

Subject:	Re: gay angels

The comments by William Hunter and John Leonard open an
important avenue for further discussion.  It's important to bear
in mind that our modern categories of sexuality are just
that--modern.  While certain kinds of sexual behavior were
clearly regarded as permissible or impermissible in the early
modern period, most of the current research with which I'm
familiar makes it equally clear that an individual's
subjectivity--be it that of a mortal or an angel--was only
beginning to be constructed in terms of a fixed sexual
identity.  The OED's first instance of the term homosexuality
comes from the very end of the 19th century:
"1892 C. G. CHADDOCK tr. Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis
III. 185 (heading) Great diminution or complete absence of
sexual feeling for the opposite sex, with substitution of sexual
feeling and instinct for the same sex. (Homo-sexuality, or
contrary sexual instinct.)"
Alan Bray's very interesting study, _Homosexuality in
Renaissance England_, cites several other words that were often
used to describe individuals whose sexual behavior would now be
termed "homosexual":  ganymede, pathic, cinaedus, catamite,
bugger, ingle, sodomite.
What is especially intriguing about William Hunter's
observation--and like John Leonard, I have always understood
Milton to be suggesting that all angels, fallen or otherwise,
could assume either sex in the act of coupling, anticipating,
perhaps, Freud's characterization of infantile sexuality as
"polymorphously perverse"--is that an early modern term for what
we now call "gay" sex was, of course, "sodomy."  To understand
Milton to be suggesting that the angels in heaven were enjoying
a kind of sexuality that the fallen world was so clearly
vilifying with such a term is to open up many of the interesting
observations concerning fallen and unfallen sexuality raised by
Turner in his _One Flesh_ to a very different, queering, kind of
analysis.
I'd be interested to know the thoughts of others on this.
All the best,
Jeffrey Shoulson
