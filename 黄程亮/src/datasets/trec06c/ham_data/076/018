Dear Stephanie:
     I would like to add my stong support to the addition of this
feature.  Typically I have several charges in play at once, and
it is never clear which particular charge has arrived.  This would
be a big step forward to keeping things in order.
     Mike.

MBNA  acquired First Union’s credit card portfolio as of June 30, 2000.  What this means to MIT is that MBNA will be the new providing bank for our VIP Purchasing Card.  Although the sale was announced last summer, the actual conversion to MBNA will not take place until June 2001.
