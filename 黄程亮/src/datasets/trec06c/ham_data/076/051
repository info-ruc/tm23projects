Everybody keeps getting emails because everybody keeps replying. We will stop getting messages the moment we all stop replying or sending messages to VIPCARDHOLDERS@mit.edu.

DO NOT REPLY TO THIS, do NOT use the "Reply" button on your Eudora to ask to be removed from anything. Or do NOT use the "Reply to All" button either! Everytime you send an email reply to the address VIPCARDHOLDERS@mit.edu you are sending it to all of us (and I think that's about 1500 users!). If your inbox is getting flooded just delete the messages, it really doesn't take that long to hit "Delete". Please just be patient, and refrain from replying, even if you're really mad and overwhelmed by the flood of messages. And if you want to reply to me, do so directly at my email address, DO NOT reply to "VIPCARDHOLDERS@mit.edu". AGAIN, DO NOT reply to VIPCARDHOLDERS@mit.edu. If you need to reply to me do so at my address: eduardog@mit.edu. Create an email from scratch, to avoid further SPAM. (If you're at MIT you're probably using Eudora. To create a new message, go to Message, New Message. To do this click the "Message" word on your menu, and then click "New Message". You can also use the CTRL-N shortcut. Sorry I don't have detailed instructions for users on a Mac. But its really not that hard to create a new message).

I doubt you really want to be removed from this list. This list is meant to be used by Stephanie Bromander who is the VISA coordinator at MIT to send us important messages regarding our credit card, why would you want to be removed? She rarely sends mass messages, and the ones she does are important and there is no better way for her to quickly keep us informed of changes on our credit card.

Again, do not reply, or send emails to VIPCARDHOLDERS. I hope this message is enough to contain the redundant "please remove me" messages.

If you still want to be removed from this list, go to https://ca.mit.edu:445/moira/ and do not contact me if you have trouble accessing it or doing stuff on that page.
