Hi Mike,
I looked at the new draft (PRL style, dated 22 May) and I think it reads
very nicely now. I still have a few comments:

- there is a number of words split by Latex between lines with only one
  letter in one of the lines. You can try adding the following commands\
  at the beginning of the document to try avoid this:
\lefthyphenmin=2
\righthyphenmin=3

- your reply to previous comments did not tell me if your Pythia MC had
  the underlying event switched off... (we are adding data "random trigger"
  events "to model ... underlying event...", p.5, left col, par 2)

- p.6, left column: I still would prefer "probability that the theory
  is consistent with data"

  right column, par 1: missing two parentheses )) after you spell out
  the ratio of sigma_D's (can take out both outside  parentheses (), since
  you have commas)

- caption to Fig 5 has ") GeV" instead of " GeV)" in two places

I think we are very close -- good job!
BTW, based on the EB responses by last Friday your second note is approved.
Can you update us on your plan for the EPS/LP paper, going to style
committee, and finally releasing the PRL draft to the collaboration
(timescales, any things missing, theory, etc)?

Cheers,
Marek
