Dear Professor/Researcher:

   !!! We can pass the Speed of Light for sure !!!

1. Today's physics assumes that the forces which a particle receives from
the fixed field sources are constant during its moving.

  Unfortunately, this prior assumption is totally WRONG! The force which
a particle receives from the fixed field source is NOT CONSTANT. It will
vary with the moving speed v of this particle. The formula will be:

    F = (1-v^2/c^2)Fo

  Where Fo is the force which a particle receives at its rest state, and
the c is the speed of light;

2. From point 1, if a particle's velocity approaches to the speed of light
c, this particle then will receive NO force. Therefore, this particle will
have NO acceleration at that time, OF COURSE this particle can not pass
the speed of light;

3. If we use other force sources, for example imaging if this particle like
a jet, then we can broken the speed of light c easily. In one word:

  !!! There is NO speed limit, and we can pass the speed of light just like
we pass the speed of sound !!!

4. The mass of a particle will NOT change during its moving. The formula:

   m = m0 / (1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)

   is wrong;

5. The time will definitely NOT change during its moving. The formula:

   t = t0 * (1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)

   is also wrong;

6. Actually, point 4 and 5 are come from the following:

   F = m0 dv/d(t0)

   (1-v^2/c^2)Fo = m0 dv/d(t0)

   Fo = [m0 dv/d(t0)] / (1-v^2/c^2)

   Fo = [m0/(1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)] * {dv/d [t0 (1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)]}

Comparing with the general form:

   Fo = m dv/dt

Then we get these two funny formulas:

   m = m0 / (1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)

and

   t = t0 * (1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)

  They are only the mathematical terms and no real physical meanings. ---
How can we use them as our principles ?!

7. So, my conclusion is: ----->> There exists NO relativity.

  One may ask that why most of the past and today's experiments have strongly
supported the relativity?

  <Answer>: There really exist some "relativity" results, BUT they are NOT
coming from the relativity, they indeed comes from the following force's
FACTOR:

   1-v^2/c^2

  Please go to my website for the details:

      === << EXPERIMENTS HINTS >> ===

  If we set S = eBR/(mc), where e is the electron charge, R is the cyclotron
radius that a charged particle bending in the magnetic field B, m is the
rest mass of this particle, and c is the speed of light.

  For the fixed magnetic field force, say Lorentz force, we have:

  Today's Theory:

      F = evB

      S = (v/c) / (1-v^2/c^2)^(1/2)

      v/c = 1 / (1+1/S^2)^(1/2)

  Yun-Qi Theory:

      F = (1-v^2/c^2) (Lorentz Force) = (1-v^2/c^2) evB

      S = (v/c) / (1-v^2/c^2)

      v/c = [1+1/(4S^2)]^(1/2) - 1/(2S)

  These two theories will give the totally different data of the real speeds
for the certain S, and will give the huge differences of the velocity changes
for the different S.

  For example, if we set the cyclotron radius is equal to one (1), the relativity
theory will teach us that the particle's velocity is 0.707106781c, BUT Yun-Qi
theory will predict that its real velocity will actually be 0.618033988c
--- the exact Golden Number. The net difference is 0.089072793c. See, there
exists a big difference here.

  Please check my website XXXX://www.yun-qi.com for the detailed data of
the huge differences. And I guess you can see the experiments soon. Since
it is NOT difficult to do these kinds of experiments today.

  Incidentally, my first Yun-Qi paper has given all the derivations from
"NON---Nothing" --- to the following most astounding academic results:

     1. Ohitor Algebra;
     2. Integration;
     3. Differentiation;
     4. Ohitor Bexl;
     5. V-Space;
     6. A-Space;
     7. Most of Mechanics Laws;
     8. Gravity Law --- is not clearly shown, but in it;
     9. Many New Laws, like spin, mota, ......

  All in a 41-page article. Here are some new concepts: ohitor, bexl, mota,
... I just can't use today's words to express them. If you are interested,
please go to my website, or you can download it directly from here:
