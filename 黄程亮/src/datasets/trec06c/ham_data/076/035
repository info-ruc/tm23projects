I think we all need to step back and collect ourselves...  The 
distribution list is a valuable tool for relaying information to us 
VIP cardholders from our administrator...  Unfortunately, what has 
transpired this morning is more of a style issue than substance...

Simply put, for all those who are interested in replying to Ms. 
Bromander, disable your "Reply To All" feature in your e-mail 
software...  This will prevent anyone who is not interested in 
receiving your comments from receiving them...  This is, of course, 
with the understanding of the original intent of the first reply... 

I think, maybe, a forum should be created for those of us who wish to 
comment can do so freely and it should also be recognized that this 
distribution list is not that forum...

Respectfully submitted...

Greg Algarin
