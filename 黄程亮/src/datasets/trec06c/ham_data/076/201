Below are my responses to John's comments.

> I'm working from the 2-column version.  I'm disappointed by the presence of 
all the passive voice, but I assume it came from people with more influence or 
persistence than I have, so I'm leaving it alone this time.  Excluding that, 
please find my comments appended below.

need to see the PRL again; just incorporate what you will of the following.

I kept this as it was.  Even though the trigger may be generic, I am
describing how to trigger on photons.

Changed to 
" Monte Carlo simulation of the \D0 detector 
determines the efficiency for these three selection 
criteria, $\epsilon_s$, as a function of $E^{\gamma}_T$.
We find $\epsilon_s \sim 60\% (75\%)$ in the CC (EC) at 8.0 GeV
and $\epsilon_s \sim 88\% (90\%)$ above 20 GeV."

I still use the CC (EC) convention (which I do like).

Change to "tracks in the road due to particles from the underlying event".  Or 
even "charged particles".  Next sentence, delete "charged".

Done. (Changed to "charged particles."

Changed to:
"Photons have a small probability of showering in 
the calorimeter cryostat or first absorber plate, and thus 
tend to deposit very little energy in EM1.  Sensitivity to a doubling of
this energy can be used to distinguish a neutral meson's 
two daughter photons from a single photon. 
We use the function $\log_{10}[1+\log_{10}\{1+E_1{\rm{(GeV)}}\}]$
as our discriminant to determine the single photon purity."

This is the first time I mention the generator level, so I mention
Pythia here.

before, so this needs to be mentioned back there, not here.  If you mention it 
by name, you should probably reference it.  (I think we have in the past used a 
Moriond talk by Jonckheere for this.)

Changed to:
"The detector response is modeled using a detailed simulation with
the energy response in $E_1$ corrected to match the data 
from $W \rightarrow e \nu$ events."

you are referencing; right now it looks like a reference to

Changed to:

CERNLIB fitting package {\textsc{HMCMLL}}\cite{mcmll}, with the fractions 
of signal and background constrained to be between 0.0 and 1.0.

the deviations are not statistically significant and there 
exists good agreement between good agreement between the 
measured ratio and theory."

Changed to exactly what you suggest.

Fixed to be  delta-sigmaU and delta-sigmaC

Deleted (Ratio) and (Theory) and fixed columns.

One remedy is to combine tables I and II.  Use Et range, plotted Et, plotted xt, 
measured cross section, delta u, deltac, measured ratio, delta u deltac.  You 
just might fit it in a single column.

Currently still two Tables.  I may have to reduce the length of the document
and, if so, I will come back to the EB.  I'm currently thinking of deleting
some of the remarks regarding cuts, etc. and refering to the published
1800 paper.  I may be able to combine the two tables, as well.

Thanks for your comments.
