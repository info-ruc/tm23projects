CERT Advisory CA-2001-16 Oracle 8i contains buffer overflow in TNS listener

   Original release date: July 03, 2001
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history is at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Systems running Oracle 8i

Overview

   A vulnerability in Oracle 8i allows remote intruders to assume control
   of database servers running on victim machines. If the Oracle server
   is running on a Windows system, an intruder may also be able to gain
   contol of the underlying operating system.

I. Description

   The COVERT labs at PGP Security have discovered a buffer overflow
   vulnerability in Oracle 8i that allows intruders to execute arbitrary
   code with the privileges of the TNS listener process. The
   vulnerability occurs in a section of code that is executed prior to
   authentication, so an intruder does not require a username or
   password.

   For more information, see the COVERT Labs Security Advisory, available
   at

          http://www.pgp.com/research/covert/advisories/050.asp

II. Impact

   An intruder who exploits the vulnerability can remotely execute
   arbitrary code. On UNIX systems, this code runs as the 'oracle' user.
   If running on Windows systems, the intruder's code will run in the
   Local System security context.

   In either case, the attacker can gain control of the database server
   on the victim machine. On Windows systems, the intruder can also gain
   administrative control of the operating system.

III. Solutions

   Install a patch from Oracle. More information is available in
   Appendix A.

Appendix A

Oracle

   Oracle has issued an alert for this vulnerability at

          http://otn.oracle.com/deploy/security/pdf/nai_net8_bof.pdf

   database server. Oracle is in the process of backporting the fix to
   supported Oracle8i database server Releases 8.1.7 and 8.1.6 and
   Oracle8 Release 8.0.6 on all platforms. The Oracle bug number for the
