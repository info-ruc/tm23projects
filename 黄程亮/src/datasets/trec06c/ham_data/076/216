That is true, in general.  However, here we are trying to determine the
fraction of the distribution that comes from photons.  The error is the
error on the fraction.  Suppose that the signal and background had
identical shapes.  Then no matter how much data you had (infinite
statistics), the error on the fraction would still be 100%.  Because
the difference in signal and background is primarily in the tail of
the distribution, the error here is actually larger than statistica
alone.

Does that make sense?
