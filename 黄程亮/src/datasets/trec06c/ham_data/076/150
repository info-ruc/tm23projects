Sir,
As you may or may not remember, I was one of your EE300 students in the fall
of 1998.  The class did not go well for me, and suffice to say I was more or
less glad to have passed it by a hair with a D, and a low one at that.  It
was my only D at the Academy, but I honestly got out of the course what I
put into it.

Now I am an 0602 Communications Officer in the Marine Corps and currently in
the first month of a six month MOS training course.  For what its worth, and
though I know it is cliche, I have to admit that I now wish I had put more
effort into your course.  If I could go back and take that course again, I
would do it without hesitation.  Little did I ever think then that such
information would actually apply to me, personally, as it does now on a
daily basis.  And what I failed to take with me back then I am having to
learn the hard way now that it truly matters.

Surprisingly, I do remember quite a bit about the basics of EE and it is
serving me well, which only leads me to believe that if I had applied myself
two and a half years ago I could have spared myself a lot of trouble both
then and now.

So in conclusion, thank you for what you taught me and for holding me
accountable.  Frankly, your class was not as hard as I had believed it to be
at the time.  And what I did take away has still put me way ahead of many of
my peers who attended other institutions and have not even had enough
exposure to EE (which is the basis for what we do as communicators) to
recieve a low D in a "bull 
major" course.  

Very Respectfully,
2ndLt. M.W. Xxxxx
