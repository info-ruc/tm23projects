Hi,
    I am very happy to hear that now we are ready to submit this paper to
EPS/LP. I have one concern regarding this paper. Figure.2 shows the purity
for two different eta ranges. In the upper plot of Fig. 2, there is one
point clearly off from the all others. This point has the smallest error,
also. I wonder how well we undrstand this plot. A less significant question
is that in the lower plot, with the exception of the last point, all the
points line up on a straight line. This is statistically very unlikely,
unless the error bars are inflated. It is also true for the upper plot with
the exception of the point with the smallest error. If we post this fiugre
in the paper, referees will likely to ask explanations for at least the
first question. Are we ready to defend our paper convincingly?

Regards,
Taka
