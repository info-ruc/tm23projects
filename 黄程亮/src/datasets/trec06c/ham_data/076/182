EB128 and others,

Here are some new comments from Mont (5/23/01) on the 630/1800 photon 
ratio PRL (Version 0.3) and my responses.  

I also forgot to mention in my last note that I have changed the tense
of this version (0.3) to use the present tense.  My previous versions 
(0.2 and 0.2) mixed past and present.  Tom and John have both pointed 
out that I have a tendency to do that.

This hasn't gone through the style review.  I thought that would happen
after being approved by the EB.  Am I correct in that assumption?

You can see a PRL format version from my photon home page,

http://www.nhn.ou.edu/~strauss/photon.html

Just click on the link to "Version 0.3 - Two Column Format".
The paper might be a little long (half a column?).  John suggested 
dropping some of the description of the analysis that is the same as 
the 1800 paper and referencing the 1800 paper.  I would
appreciate any suggestions on what could/should be dropped in this paper.
If I drop a figure, which one?  What text could be dropped?

Changed the order, and changed "yield" to "show"

Changed to "The cross section measurment at 630 GeV uses a sample of 
520 nb$^{-1}$ of data recorded in 1995~\cite{lum} with the \DO detector 
at the Fermilab Tevatron~\cite{D0}."

That change to midsentence was put in after Tom saw the first draft.
It was John's suggestion.  Because the sentence has changed, I have put 
the references as shown above.  Tom?

>  o page 7, para 5, change ".., and a two forward .."

Done.  Missed that typo.
 
>  o page 8, para 2, change ".. beam pipe which detect .."
>                        to ".. beam pipe, which detect .."

Done.

>  o page 9, para 3, change "A [9] Monte Carlo, overlaid .."
>                        to "A Monte Carlo[9], overlaid .."

Done.

Changed to 
" Identical selection criteria that determine photon .."


Keep the comments coming.  I want this paper published before the first
Run 2 paper.
