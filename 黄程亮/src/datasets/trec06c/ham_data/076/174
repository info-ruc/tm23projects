How can thermal emmiters hung off to the side, push the ships backward?

If the thermal radiation from the RTGs is not emitted equally in all
directions, then it would produce a net thrust opposite the direction it
is emitted most strongly.  There are a variety of ways this could
happen, such as an asymmetrical temperature distribution in the RTGs
themselves or the RTGs being obscured behind some part of the
spacecraft.

Spacecraft themselves are so asymmetrical it would be difficult to predict
the effect of such a vector force not designed into the probe. I also wonder
if magnetohydrodynamic drag can effect long-term missions.

My problem with citing unknown physics as the cause is not in the strength
of any particular explanation, it is the apparent lack of the effect
occuring equally on all bodies, and I wish to remind the readers that the
prototype examples are sister missions.
