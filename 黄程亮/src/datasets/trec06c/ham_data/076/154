<h3><a name="process">Process</a></h3>
Now that we've got the full source of a spam message that was sent to us,
let's look at it to try and figure out where email originated from and see
how we can alert the system administrator of the spam.<br><br>

Note that the first three lines of the above source show the path the
email took.  In some messages, multiple hops will be made, but they will
almost always be composed of three line blocks such as this.  In those
cases, you will want to go to the last block on the list to find the first
email server that received the message.  See the below examples for more
on this.<br><br>

Notice that the message claims that:

Received: from leo (pomuhn02193.netvigator.com [208.151.78.193])

Meaning a machine named leo who claimed to be pomuhn02193.netvigator.com
with an IP address of 208.151.78.193 sent a message through
nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu to the user on Wed, 25 Apr 2001.  The machine name is
configured by the user and so we can't trust that, and the name
pomuhn02193.netvigator.com can be faked easily, but it's harder to fake
the IP address.  So 208.151.78.193 is our first bit of information that
will lead us to our spam report.<br><br>

Now it's time for us to find out where to send our complain based on the
IP.  Our first stop is <a
href="http://swhois.net/">http://swhois.net/</a>.  Swhois is a smart whois
query that will recursively try whois servers until it has the right server
for a given IP address.  When we try our suspect IP, we're told that it is from:
<pre>
Cable &amp; Wireless USA (NETBLK-CW-10BLK) 
	CW-10BLK  208.128.0.0 - 208.175.255.255
Hong Kong Telephone, Inc. MIAA 28/F TELECOM TOWER (NETBLK-CW-208-151-64) 
	CW-208-151-64 208.151.64.0 - 208.151.95.255
</pre>
The descriptions in parenthesis are links to more detailed information for
each of those records, so we're going to click on both of those to find
the email address we need to send the complaint to.<br><br>

The second link gives us the email sellect@netvigator.com, and the first
one gives ipadmin@cw.net.  The best emails to send the spam report to
would first be: sellect@netvigator.com, abuse@netvigator.com,
and postmaster@netvigator.com.  If we don't receive a reply from them, or
if we think that our complaint might be better heard by the first
provider, we can always send it to those addresses as well (abuse@cw.net,
postmaster@cw.net). 

<h3><a name="ae">Additional Examples</a></h3> Here are some additional
examples to demonstrate how to locate the correct source IP from an email.  
Note that even the source IP on the first connection can be spoofed,
however, it requires an insecure mail server to send through to do that,
and, in that case, often going to the second server the mail was sent to
and complaining that their mail server is misconfigured can be a positive
step to take.
