Mike, yes this makes perfect sense.

My difficulties arise because I'm used to fitting this set of points to 
a functional form and displaying the resulting error on this Fit (let's 
say "capitol F": Fit).  This contrasts to the way you get each 
individual point and error bar, with a little-f fit.  My knowledge that 
we had all agreed to no Fit, to instead use bin-by-bin information, got 
suppressed by a long-ingrained instict of mine to minimize uncertainties 
whenever possible.

So when Taka asked about the error bars, I suggested showing the Fit 
errors.  You replied, to my confusion, that the little-f fit errors were 
already displayed.  My recent correspondence with you sort of went 
downhill from there!  Sorry.
