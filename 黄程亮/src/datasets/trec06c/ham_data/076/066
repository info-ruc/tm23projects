Peggy -

	We may have credit cards, but we are not all idiots. The problem
here is that most mail programs show you mail oldest message first. In
other words, when someone (like you) says "don't reply to this big
mailing list", that message doesn't get read before older messages
elicit a "Please take me off this list" reply.

	The other problem is that the machine that handles this mailing
list hasn't been set up to only forward mail from certain VIP card
administrators and reject all others. Instead, it is forwarding mail
from anyone.

	Fixing either of these two problems (the last fix being the more
practical) would likely stop this "mail storm" from continuing. In the
mean time, just delete the messages that are bound to continue to
arrive, and realize that it isn't the author's fault.

	I promise to not send anything else to this mailing list.

	Best,

		Gill Pratt
