Jerry,

Pony lost most of it's staff and became difficult.  Joey Sims (who we
dealt with at Pony) moved to another company - Build To Order who we use
now.  We get prices from them that are as good as we got from Pony, with
the same kind of warranties etc.  We are happy with them.  Contact info
- Joey Sims, 678-297-9945.
