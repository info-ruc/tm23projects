Dear VIP Cardholders:

MBNA Corporation and First Union announced recently that they have entered into an agreement for MBNA to acquire First Union’s  consumer and commercial credit card businesses.  MBNA  acquired First Union’s credit card portfolio as of June 30, 2000.  What this means to MIT is that MBNA will be the new providing bank for our VIP Purchasing Card.  Although the sale was announced last summer, the actual conversion to MBNA will not take place until June 2001.  

MBNA is a proven leader in the credit card business and this portfolio sale should be a seamless transition to MIT.  MBNA promises to continue providing us with the same high level of service that we are currently receiving.

This change should not affect the use of your card.  You will not have to replace your existing card, which will remain valid through August of 2003.

You will receive shortly a notice from First Union regarding a Notice of Change in Terms.  First Union is required to send this notice to all cardholders directly, even though individuals are not responsible for payment under the MIT agreement.

As the conversion date approaches, we will keep you updated regarding any changes that may affect you as a cardholder.

If you have any questions please feel free to call me or type to vipcard@mit.edu.
