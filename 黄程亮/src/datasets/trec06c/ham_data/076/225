Dear Mr. Lyons,
  I think it's very exciting to see someone from promise talking to the
community.  I think the most important thing to remember is that even if the
company does not release source, people will reverse engineer the cards
anyway - possibly not giving the best support to the hardware that could be
given with GPL'd source.  How does that make the product look?  If I can buy
a controller that is very well documented (like my Adaptec 2940) and will
serve my needs, and has source, I (personally) will pick that card over a
closed source product where I cannot update the binary only driver provided
by the manufacturer.  While I recognize that sometimes it's hard to get
"suits" to understand this, I encourage you to try.  :-)
  Along these lines, I'm wondering what your interest, and Promise's policy
is about Interviews?  I'm curious to get your companies views on Linux, and
also yours - I run a small (VERY loose, VERY non-serious) website called
http://www.geekizoid.com/ and while we mostly cover troll related net humor,
we also are trying to branch out and do more serious stuff.  The Interview
(if you would agree to it) would be "Slashdot style" - we'd let the
readership know you were willing to answer questions, and we'd then forward
them to you - you would then answer the ones you wanted, and those answers,
verbatim with no editing, would appear with the questions as asked.
