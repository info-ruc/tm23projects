It wouldn't be incorrect, no.

The basic distinction is number of objects versus number of files.
The catalog has a very high # of objects/file, while the images have 1/1.
I guess I might advocate a column with number of objects, as interesting in
its own right, as a proxy for complexity of the data.

yes. Sorry.

Yes, that is right.
