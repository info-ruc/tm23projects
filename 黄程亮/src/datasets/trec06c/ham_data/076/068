I am sorry if I offended anyone.... I have enough email as it is to 
contend with on a daily basis (as I am certain you do), and this 
morning was just non-stop riffraff.  I have work to do and this 
situation was getting out of hand.  If the fault is in the system 
than something must be done to improve the technology.

This is the last you will hear from me.  Have a nice day and I truly 
don't believe that we are idiots.  We could not be here if we were.
