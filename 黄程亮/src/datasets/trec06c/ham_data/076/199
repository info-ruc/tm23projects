I'm working from the 2-column version.  I'm disappointed by the presence of all the passive voice, but I assume it came from people with more influence or persistence than I have, so I'm leaving it alone this time.  Excluding that, please find my comments appended below.

I did not actually go through the values in the tables.  There are others in the collaboration with that particular strength anyway.  Good luck Mike, I don't need to see the PRL again; just incorporate what you will of the following.

    - John


pg 4, col 1, last full para, "...while EM3 is segmented into 0.05x0.05 sections, The electromagnetic..."  Better make that comma into a period I think.

---

Next para, first sentece, change to "D0 uses a three-tiered triggering system."  What you have now is a bit clumsy and what you describe is not specific to photons until the final step.

---

second column, last full para, insert new sentence at beginning: "Candidates within the acceptance region must satisfy four selection criteria."

---

same para, middle.  Although appently a D0 favorite, I do not like the CC (EC) convention.  That same sentence starts with a symbol, which seems odd.  You might consider changing two sentences

"The efficiency of these last three...beyond 20 GeV."

to these: "Simulation of these cuts determines their efficiency as a function of Et^gamma.  In the CC, we find epsilon_s = 0.60 at 8 GeV and 0.88 at 20 GeV, and in the EC we find 0.75 and 0.90 respectively."

---

same para, "tracks in the road due to tracks from the underlying event."  Change to "tracks in the road due to particles from the underlying event".  Or even "charged particles".  Next sentence, delete "charged".

---

Page 5, column 1, first para, "The relatively small probability...[all the way to] ...as our discriminant."  Change to "Photons have a small probability to shower in the calorimeter cryostat or first absorber plate, and thus tend to deposit very little energy in EM1.  Sensitivity to a doubling of
this energy can help distinguish a neutral meson's two daughter photons from a single photon.  Our studies show our best discriminant takes the form log log log log..."

--

second para, you mention Pythia here by name but prior references to MC were not named.  We should mention Pythia earlier (or Herwig or isajet if that was used).  Be consistent.

same para, "Three categories of fully simulated events are generated; ..."  You want a colon here, not the semicolon.

--

second column, "GEANT simulation".  We have mentioned a detector simulation before, so this needs to be mentioned back there, not here.  If you mention it by name, you should probably reference it.  (I think we have in the past used a Moriond talk by Jonckheere for this.)

--

next para, you should reference HMCMLL as being part of Cernlib.  Or perhaps better, you could reference "fit" and have the bibliography cite HMCMLL, part of Cernlib.  If this is in fact reference [10] then it should be moved to the thing you are referencing; right now it looks like a reference to
constraining parameters to lie between 0 and 1.

--

page 6, column 2 first full para, last sentence, "...good agreement between..." change to "...the deviations are not statistically significant and there exists good agreement between..."

--

last para, 2nd sentence "Although some discrepancies exist..."  I think you say all this better with "Despite some descrepancy between data and the prediction at low Et, there is good...

--

Figure 1:  Why use [ and { as the braces instead of the mathematical convention of using ( and [?  I suggest you remove that from the caption entirely and use "Distribution of the discriminant for photon purity, where E1 is in units of GeV.  Points..."  That caption is overlong anyway.

--

Fig 5, the "diagonal terms of the covariance matrix" is pretty clumsy when you actually see it in print.  How about, "shaded blocks indicate both bin width and the completely correlated uncertainty of each point."  (Prediction: this shaded band will cause trouble in collaboration review.  Your
current phrasing is correct but clumsy, all attempts to change it will make it more elegant but wrong!)

--
Table I, you don't actually have any columns labeled deltaU deltaC.  They are delta-sigmaU, delta-sigmaC.

Table II, do you really have to tell the reader (Ratio) (Theory)?  I think not, myself.  Also the column label thing.

--

I hope the above changes shorten the document -- I think you are overlong.  One remedy is to combine tables I and II.  Use Et range, plotted Et, plotted xt, measured cross section, delta u, deltac, measured ratio, delta u deltac.  You just might fit it in a single column.
