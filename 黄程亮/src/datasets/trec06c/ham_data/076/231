Unfortunately, I see no way to "tack" this craft. It is not a sail, in that
it doesn't deflect anything. As far as being one way, well I suppose that is
more a matter of charge than anything else. It should be possible to use
this for braking a ship coming into a solar system as well. Weren't we
looking at a system that would accelerate a craft out but couldn't slow it
down? Here are the brakes....

What if the magnaetic bubble was also spinning (or varying it's field 
orientation in a cirular manner) like a magnuson effect wind-sail,
or a spinning baseball?  (let's ignore surface irregularity arguments 
for the moment.)

Would this allow one to "Tack" a spherical object against the wind.

I realize those are pressure effects, and that the solar wind may not 
be dense enough to provide much of a differential, but we might be
able to over come that by increasing the rotation speed.  (especially
if we are talking rotating energy, and not rotating mass.)

ok, it is early, and we all know that my physics is not the greatest,
but imagine a magnetic field spinning at a very high rate, with speed
control provided by the fastest dedicated CPU we can muster.

Now imagine a solar wind particle entering the sphere from one side,
it is moving at a pretty good clip.  Upon interacting with our mag-
field, the particle will be deflected 90 degrees (depending upon the
speed of the rotation) and the momentum vector will not point directly 
away from the sun, but off to one side or the other.

This will allow you to add to your orbital speed, thereby slowing
down, while moving to a larger orbit, or subtract from your orbital 
speed, thus moving into a tighter orbit, and speeding up.

It's been a while since my college physics course and its coverage of
electromagnetism, but I think making the magnetic field spin is probably
not going to be that effective.  I do remember fairly clearly that
charged particles spiral around magnetic field lines, since I had a
physics lab that demonstrated this experimentally; continuously changing
the orientation of the magnetic field will probably not do what you're
hoping it would do.

I suspect simply orienting the magnetic field in a particular way
without continuously varying the orientation would deflect the charged
particles in the solar wind to produce some ability to steer the thrust
so it wouldn't have to be exactly parallel to the solar wind's flow.

Actually, I think it would be simplest to just vary the potential of the
magnetic field on one side to create an imbalanced thrust....

Hmm a blank subject --- that makes it real quiet.
I just happened to reading this "Artificial Gravity and the Architecture of
Orbital
Habitats"
http://www.spacefuture.com/archive/artificial_gravity_and_the_architecture_of_orbital_habitats.shtml
This is interesting as it seems that any space travel for longer than about
6-9 months requires some form of Artfitial gravity. For us low tech people
with out synthetic gravity that means a diameter of 40+ meters for a rotating
living area.. So until we get the nuclear rockets developed even in solar system
travel will require gravity.
