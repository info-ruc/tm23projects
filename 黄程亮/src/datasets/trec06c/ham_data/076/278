Overview

   Several implementations of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
   (LDAP) protocol contain vulnerabilities that may allow
   denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized privileged access, or both. If
   your site uses any of the products listed in this advisory, the CERT/CC
   encourages you to follow the advice provided in the Solution section
   below.

I. Description

   The LDAP protocol provides access to directories that support the X.500
   directory semantics without requiring the additional resources of
   X.500. A directory is a collection of information such as names,
   addresses, access control lists, and cryptographic certificates.
   Because LDAP servers are widely used in maintaining corporate contact
   information and providing authentication services, any threats to their
   integrity or stability can jeopardize the security of an organization.

   To test the security of protocols like LDAP, the PROTOS project
   presents a server with a wide variety of sample packets containing
   unexpected values or illegally formatted data. This approach may reveal
   vulnerabilities that would not manifest themselves under normal
   conditions. As a member of the PROTOS project consortium, the Oulu
   University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) co-developed and
   subsequently used the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite to study several
   implementations of the LDAP protocol.

   The PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite is divided into two main sections: the
   "Encoding" section, which tests an LDAP server's response to packets
   that violate the Basic Encoding Rules (BER), and the "Application"
   section, which tests an LDAP server's response to packets that trigger
   LDAP-specific application anomalies. Each section is further divided
   into "groups" that collectively exercise a particular encoding or
   application feature. Finally, each group contains one or more "test
   cases," which represent the network packets that are used to test
   individual exceptional conditions.

   By applying the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite to a variety of popular
   LDAP-enabled products, the OUSPG revealed the following
   vulnerabilities:

   VU#276944 - iPlanet Directory Server contains multiple vulnerabilities
   in LDAP handling code
    
       The iPlanet Directory Server contains multiple vulnerabilities in
       the code that processes LDAP requests.
    
       In the encoding section of the test suite, this product had an
       indeterminate number of failures in the group that tests invalid
       BER length of length fields.
    
       In the application section of the test suite, this product failed
       four groups and had inconclusive results for an additional five
       groups. The four failed groups indicate the presence of buffer
       overflow vulnerabilities. For the inconclusive groups, the product
       exhibited suspicious behavior while testing for format string
       vulnerabilities.
    
   VU#505564 - IBM SecureWay Directory is vulnerable to denial-of-service
   attacks via LDAP handling code
    
       The IBM SecureWay Directory server contains one or more
       vulnerabilities in the code that processes LDAP requests. These
       vulnerabilities were discovered independently by IBM using the
       PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite. The CERT/CC is not currently aware of the
       nature of these vulnerabilities.
    
   VU#583184 - Lotus Domino R5 Server Family contains multiple
   vulnerabilities in LDAP handling code
    
       The Lotus Domino R5 Server Family (including the Enterprise,
       Application, and Mail servers) contains multiple vulnerabilities in
       the code that processes LDAP requests.
    
       In the encoding section of the test suite, this product failed 1 of
       77 groups. The failed group tests a server's response to
       miscellaneous packets with semi-valid BER encodings.
    
       In the application section of the test suite, this product failed
       23 of 77 groups. These results suggest that both buffer overflow
       and format string vulnerabilities are likely to be present in a
       variety of application components.
    
   VU#688960 - Teamware Office contains multiple vulnerabilities in LDAP
   handling code
    
       The Teamware Office suite is packaged with a combination X.500/LDAP
       server that provides directory services. Multiple versions of the
       Office product contain vulnerabilities that cause the LDAP server
       to crash in response to traffic sent by the PROTOS LDAPv3 test
       suite.
    
       In the encoding section of the test suite, this product failed 9 of
       16 groups involving invalid encodings for several BER object types.
    
       In the application section of the test suite, this product failed 4
       of 32 groups. The remaining 45 groups were not exercised during the
       test runs. The four failed groups indicate the presence of buffer
       overflow vulnerabilities.
    
   VU#717380 - Potential vulnerabilities in Qualcomm Eudora WorldMail
   Server LDAP handling code
    
       While investigating the vulnerabilities reported by OUSPG, it was
       brought to our attention that the Eudora WorldMail Server may
       contain vulnerabilities that can be triggered via the PROTOS test
       suite. The CERT/CC has reported this possibility to Qualcomm and an
       investigation is pending.
    
   VU#763400 - Microsoft Exchange 5.5 LDAP Service is vulnerable to
   denial-of-service attacks
    
       The Microsoft Exchange 5.5 LDAP Service contains a vulnerability
       that causes the LDAP server to freeze in response to malformed LDAP
       requests generated by the PROTOS test suite. This only affects the
       LDAP service; all other Exchange services, including mail handling,
       continue normally.
    
       Although this product was not included in OUSPG's initial testing,
       subsequent informal testing revealed that the LDAP service of the
       Microsoft Exchange 5.5 became unresponsive while processing test
       cases containing exceptional BER encodings for the LDAP filter type
       field.
    
   VU#765256 - Network Associates PGP Keyserver contains multiple
   vulnerabilities in LDAP handling code
    
       The Network Associates PGP Keyserver 7.0 contains multiple
       vulnerabilities in the code that processes LDAP requests.
    
       In the encoding section of the test suite, this product failed 12
       of 16 groups.
    
       In the application section of the test suite, this product failed 1
       of 77 groups. The failed group focused on out-of-bounds integer
       values for the messageID parameter. Due to a peculiarity of this
       test group, this failure may actually represent an encoding
       failure.
    
   VU#869184 - Oracle 8i Enterprise Edition contains multiple
   vulnerabilities in LDAP handling code
    
       The Oracle 8i Enterprise Edition server contains multiple
       vulnerabilities in the code used to process LDAP requests.
    
       In the encoding section of the test suite, this product failed an
       indeterminate number of test cases in the group that tests a
       server's response to invalid encodings of BER OBJECT-IDENTIFIER
       values.
    
       In the application section of the test suite, this product failed
       46 of 77 groups. These results suggest that both buffer overflow
       and format string vulnerabilities are likely to be present in a
       variety of application components.
    
   VU#935800 - Multiple versions of OpenLDAP are vulnerable to
   denial-of-service attacks

       There are multiple vulnerabilities in the OpenLDAP implementations
       of the LDAP protocol. These vulnerabilities exist in the code that
       translates network datagrams into application-specific information.
    
       In the encoding section of the test suite, this product failed the
       group that tests the handling of invalid BER length of length
       fields.
    
       In the application section of the test suite, this product passed
       all 6685 test cases.
    
Additional Information

   For the most up-to-date information regarding these vulnerabilities,
   please visit the CERT/CC Vulnerability Notes Database at:

          http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/

   Please note that the test results summarized above should not be
   interpreted as a statement of overall software quality. However, the
   CERT/CC does believe that these results are useful in describing the
   characteristics of these vulnerabilities. For example, an application
   that fails multiple groups indicates that problems exist in different
   areas of the code, rather than in a specific code segment.

II. Impact

   VU#276944 - iPlanet Directory Server contains multiple vulnerabilities
   in LDAP handling code

       One or more of these vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to
       execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Directory Server.
       The server typically runs with system privileges. At least one of
       these vulnerabilities has been successfully exploited in a
       laboratory environment under Windows NT 4.0, but they may affect
       other platforms as well.

   VU#505564 - IBM SecureWay Directory is vulnerable to denial-of-service
   attacks via LDAP handling code

       These vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to crash affected
       SecureWay Directory servers, resulting in a denial-of-service
       condition. It is not known at this time whether these
       vulnerabilities will allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
       code. These vulnerabilities exist on the Solaris and Windows 2000
       platforms but are not present under Windows NT, AIX, and AIX with
       SSL.

   VU#583184 - Lotus Domino R5 Server Family contains multiple
   vulnerabilities in LDAP handling code

       One or more of these vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to
       execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Domino
       server. The server typically runs with system privileges. At least
       one of these vulnerabilities has been successfully exploited in a
       laboratory environment.

   VU#688960 - Teamware Office contains multiple vulnerabilities in LDAP
   handling code

       These vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to crash affected
       Teamware LDAP servers, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
       They may also allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
       with the privileges of the Teamware server. The server typically
       runs with system privileges.

   VU#717380 - Potential vulnerabilities in Qualcomm Eudora WorldMail
   Server LDAP handling code

       The CERT/CC has not yet determined the impact of this vulnerability. 

   VU#763400 - Microsoft Exchange 5.5 LDAP Service is vulnerable to
   denial-of-service attacks

       This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to crash the LDAP
       component of vulnerable Exchange 5.5 servers, resulting in a
       denial-of-service condition within the LDAP component.

   VU#765256 - Network Associates PGP Keyserver contains multiple
   vulnerabilities in LDAP handling code

       One or more of these vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to
       execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Keyserver. The
       server typically runs with system privileges. At least one of these
       vulnerabilities has been successfully exploited in a laboratory
       environment.

   VU#869184 - Oracle 8i Enterprise Edition contains multiple
   vulnerabilities in LDAP handling code

       One or more of these vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to
       execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Oracle
       server. The server typically runs with system privileges. At least
       one of these vulnerabilities has been successfully exploited in a
       laboratory environment.

   VU#935800 - Multiple versions of OpenLDAP are vulnerable to
   denial-of-service attacks

       These vulnerabilities allow a remote attacker to crash affected
       OpenLDAP servers, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

III. Solution

Apply a patch from your vendor

   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.
   Please consult this appendix to determine if you need to contact your
   vendor directly.

Block access to directory services at network perimeter

   As a temporary measure, it is possible to limit the scope of these
   vulnerabilities by blocking access to directory services at the
   network perimeter. Please note that this workaround does not protect
   vulnerable products from internal attacks.

   Downloads" or "Software Downloads" for links to the fix distribution
   sites.

iPlanet E-Commerce Solutions

   [CERT/CC Addendum: These vulnerabilities were originally discovered in
   Directory Server 5.0 Beta and were later found to exist in versions up
   to and including version 4.13. These vulnerabilities have been
   addressed in the released version of Directory Server 5.0.]

Lotus Development Corporation

   Lotus reproduced the problem as reported by OUSPG and documented it in
   SPR#DWUU4W6NC8.

   Lotus considers security issues as top priority, so we acted quickly
   to resolve the problem in a maintenance update to Domino. It was
   addressed in Domino R5.0.7a, which was released on May 18th, 2001.
   This release can be downloaded from Notes.net at

          http://www.notes.net/qmrdown.nsf/qmrwelcome.

   The fix is documented in the fix list at

          http://www.notes.net/r5fixlist.nsf/Search!SearchView&Query=DWUU
          4W6NC8

Microsoft Corporation

   Microsoft is developing a hotfix for this issue which will be
   available shortly.

   Customers can obtain this hotfix by contacting Product Support
   Services at no charge and asking for Q303448 and Q303450. Information
   on contacting Microsoft Product Support Services can be found at

          http://www.microsoft.com/support/

Network Associates, Inc.

   Network Associates has resolved these vulnerabilities in Hotfix 2 for
   both Solaris and Windows NT. All Network Associates Enterprise Support
   customers have been notified and have been provided access to the
   Hotfix.

   This Hotfix can be downloaded at

          http://www.pgp.com/downloads/default.asp

The OpenLDAP Project

   [CERT/CC Addendum: To address these vulnerabilities, the OpenLDAP
   Project has released OpenLDAP 1.2.12 for use in LDAPv2 environments
   and OpenLDAP 2.0.8 for use in LDAPv3 environments. The CERT/CC
   recommends that users of OpenLDAP contact their software vendor or
   obtain the latest version, available at
   http://www.openLDAP.org/software/download/.]

QUALCOMM Incorporated

   The LDAP service in WorldMail may be vulnerable to this exploit, but
   our tests so far have been inconclusive. At this time, we strongly
   urge all WorldMail customers to ensure that the LDAP service is not
   accessible from outside their organization nor by untrusted users.

The Teamware Group

   An issue has been discovered with Teamware Office Enterprise Directory
   (LDAP server) that shows a abnormal termination or loop when the LDAP
   server encounters a maliciously or incorrectly created LDAP request
   data.

   If the maliciously formatted LDAP request data is requested, the LDAP
   server may excessively copy the LDAP request data to the stack area.

   This overflow is likely to cause execution of malicious code. In other
   case, the LDAP server may go into abnormal termination or infinite
   loop.

   [CERT/CC Addendum: Teamware has provided additional documentation of
   these issues in their "Teamware Solution Database," available at
   http://support.teamw.com/Online/s_database1.shtml. Registered users
   can find information on these vulnerabilities by searching for
   document #010703-0000 for Windows NT or document #010703-0001 for
   Solaris.]

Appendix B. - Supplemental Information

The PROTOS Project

   The PROTOS project is a research partnership between the University of
   Oulu and VTT Electronics, an independent research organization owned
   by the Finnish government. The project studies methods by which
   protocol implementations can be tested for information security
   defects.

   Although the vulnerabilities discussed in this advisory relate
   specifically to the LDAP protocol, the methodology used to research,
   develop, and deploy the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite can be applied to any
   communications protocol.

   For more information on the PROTOS project and its collection of test
   suites, please visit

          http://www.ee.oulu.fi/research/ouspg/protos/

ASN.1 and the BER

   Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) is a flexible notation that
   allows one to define a variety data types. The Basic Encoding Rules
   (BER) describe how to represent or encode the values of each ASN.1
   type as a string of octets. This allow programmers to encode and
   decode data for platform-independent transmission over a network.
