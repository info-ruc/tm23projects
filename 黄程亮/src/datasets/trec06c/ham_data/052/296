   No, but I have used my HP48sx to control the Fascinating Electronics
board as well as an NRD535 shortwave receiver.  The serial I/O of the HP48
is limited to shield, ground, tx and rx pins so in both cases I had to
wire special cables to jumper handshaking pins to fool the device into
accepting signals.  We're not talking OC196 speeds here, so everything
has worked fine.
