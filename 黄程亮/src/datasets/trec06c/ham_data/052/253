Hello 'Botter,

I think I am about to ask a stupid question but as a precaution, will the
Expansion board be "ok" with a new 12V motor supply rather than the 9.6V
connected to the Power Expansion header (J13)on the HB since the Expansion
board and HB share the same header? Also, I'd be very appreciated for any
tips on how to modify the Expansion board to work with a the new 12V power
supply, if needed (does it?). Thanks alot guys.

G. Tran
