Subject: Is there a device that...?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Is there a device that connects to a computers COM or Parallel port that
can measure voltage, on different channels.  All I need is a digital
input like the HB.  So if there is a signal it would report true and if
there is no signal then it would report false.   I need 7 different
channels, and it has to be able to communicate with a C++ program.

Thanks
