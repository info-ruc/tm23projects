Would anyone using the OED with dict/adict be able to provide me with
some sample views of the sessions you use often?

My group at Stanford is developing the online web OED with Oxford,
and I'm thinking it would be nice to have an unofficial command-line
program that could do the same types of lookups that dict does.  The
actual lookups and stuff aren't hard to do, but what I would like is
an idea of what the results look like.

I guess follows should go directly to me, since I doubt anyone else here
is all that interested what a session looks like. =)


Jim
