First off, how much are you looking to pay?  It can be built fairly
cheaply if you are interested.
 
Second, there is a mailing list for the miniboard.  Check out Fred
Martin's FTP site relating to the miniboard for the details.  It's all in
there.
 
Thirdly, I'm sure someone has.  I'm currently using it as a brain to a
Sumo bot.  Look around, I'm sure someone on the mailing list can help you.
