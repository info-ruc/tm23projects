before I reinvent the wheelI haven't actually done this, but I'm pretty =
sure the theory is ok...

On the handyboard web page is the pa79600 icb file which lets you use =
port a bit 7 as serial i/o. I have successfully used this to control =
some minissc's. I think that if you wired a cable between the hp and the =
Hb (heh heh) you should be able to write some code to display a =
character sent. In fact I think a few hp pages have a basic serial =
program on them which you may be able to use...

hope this helps,
Adam
