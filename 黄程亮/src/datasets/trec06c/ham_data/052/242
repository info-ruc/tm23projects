Thanks everyone for your help,

Now, I recieved two good answers for my problems.

1) Built an H-Bridge
2) Use the LMD18200

Now has any one any documentation on an easy H bridge that I could build
without wasting much time?
The same goes for the LMD18200, I understand that is not compatible with
the HB, has any one built a small circuit which would interface the HB
and LMD18200

Thanks,
