Do you know where the Caps Lock key is on your keyboard? Look for it, there is a little diode lighting up when it's on. If you see the little light, please do me a favor and before typing your email press the caps lock key once.

GET IT? THANKS FOR LISTENING.

FYI, writing in all caps is roughly the equivalent of shouting instead of talking to somebody in front of you. Real impolite.

And finally if you go read the handy board FAQ, you will find an answer to your question. Try http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#morepower
