Re: Parallel Port... if you want to see how to
get 8 input bits, all straightened out, see:
http://homepages.together.net/~tking/parport.htm

There is also a program called SEEBITS that allows
you to easily see all the input bits and set the
output bits on and off.

I am working on a "Parallel Port Brick" that
will have outputs identical to an RCX, but be run from
the PC, for the stationary portions of larger
projects with many more bits ... 
 Eventually I may do the inputs, too.
