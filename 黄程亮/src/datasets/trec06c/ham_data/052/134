I am currently using my parallel port for the same application. I am not sure 
how specific your question was, but the output voltage is 5Vdc. However, 
remember that this is a logic level which means it will not give not give you 
more than ~20mA ( I am not sure). So if your load require more than that, you 
might need to use a separate 5Vdc source. The output pins and input pins of 
the parallel port that you are looking for is as follow:

INPUT PINS

DB25            BIT #
------          ------
15                  3   
13                  4
12                  5
10                  6
11                  7

OUTPUT PINS

DB25                BIT #
-------             ------
2                       0
3                       1
4                       2
5                       3
6                       4
7                       5
8                       6
9                       7

Good Luck!
