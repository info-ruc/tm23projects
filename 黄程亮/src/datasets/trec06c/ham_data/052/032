Correct, it has a minimum voltage for correct operation. You can use a separate
battery pack with a higher voltage and simply connect the grounds to your 9.6V
battery. This chip is NOT a 293 replacement. You would have to build a small
circuit board (with heat sink, preferred) and then connect the proper signals
from the Handyboard to control the 18200. Otherwise a nice driver chip.
