Hi,

Has someone tried a four wheel robot base using diferential traction?, I'm
making this question because I'm not sure of the tree wheel configuration,
in the last base that I made, the caster wheel has ever maked some bad
influence in the robot trajectory, Also my motors are not very powerful so I
think that with four of them there will be best results. I believe that in
each side of the base the correponding pair of wheels must be enough close
one of the other to allow the robot to turn without problems. I am right?

Thank You

Jose Luis
