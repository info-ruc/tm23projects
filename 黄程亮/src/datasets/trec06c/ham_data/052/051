Hi, Sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday.  

It sounds like you need to tune your radio modules.  It could be your
transmitter, receiver or both.  If you don't have a function generator to
create an input square wave for testing, you could try to get a timing
pulse off the Handy Board somewhere.  The servo libs pulse at about 50 Hz
(I think) which is likely to be too slow for the radio modules.  You
really need something in the 300 Hz to 1400 Hz range, and close to 50%
duty cycle.  There is a timing signal to the motor driver chips, but I'm
not sure what the frequency is. (does anyone have this info?)

The reason why is is difficult to tune the modules off the pulse created
by the encoder board is that it transmitts in packets (I think it's a 12
bit word repeated 3 times per packet).  There is lots of time, between
packets, you really need a constant input signal.  

Once you have an input wave set up, watch the data out of the RE module on
your scope and tune the cap.  the modules come pretty reliably tuned from
the factory, so if you have any that that have not been adjusted, you
should start by using that to first tune one module, and then tune the
other (if you have a new transmitter, use it to adjust your receiver...)

good luck,
Michael
