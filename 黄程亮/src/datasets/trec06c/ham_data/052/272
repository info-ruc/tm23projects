Doh! I should have said I was planning on using IR, but a serial cable makes
more sense (at least to start with)...

Thanks,
Paul

I haven't actually done this, but I'm pretty sure the theory is ok...

On the handyboard web page is the pa79600 icb file which lets you use port a
bit 7 as serial i/o. I have successfully used this to control some
minissc's. I think that if you wired a cable between the hp and the Hb (heh
heh) you should be able to write some code to display a character sent. In
fact I think a few hp pages have a basic serial program on them which you
may be able to use...

hope this helps,
Adam

  Has anyone used their HP48 to talk to a handyboard?
