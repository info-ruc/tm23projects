HAS ANY ONE USED MOTORS RATED OVER 1 AMP WITH THE HANDY BOARD?

IF SO, HOW DID YOU GO ABOUT INTERFACING WITH THE HB?

DID ANYONE USE THE L293 D/B, OR THE SNJ74 ?

IS IT A BAD IDEA TO PIGGY-BACK MORE THAN TWO OF THESE CHIPS IN PARALLEL,
SAY 3 OR 4?

THIS IS MY PROBLEM

MY MOTORS RATE 1AMP CONTINUOUS AND 3.5 PEAK
I'M USING A NICD BATTERY 9.6 VOLTS 950 mAh

HOW DO I GO ABOUT DOING THIS????
