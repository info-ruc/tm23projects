  Well, just on the subject of proximity detectors, I have a couple of projects
on my web page that use IR LEDs to do proximity detection.  I have the code for
the PIC based solution posted and a couple of different circuits, including one
for the LEGO RCX.  http://www.verinet.com/~dlc/botlinks.htm.  For the IRPD PIC 
code see the PIC based IRPD project, for the LEGO circuits see the Mindstorms 
IRPD project.

have fun,
DLC
