Hi everybody,

I'm a novice in the field of microcontrollers, and I'm trying to use the
handyboard with ICC11V5 and NoICEV2.5.2. The compiler gave me no problem
(thanks to a search on this list archive!) but I can't get NoICE to work.
Has anybody on the list managed to configure it for the HB?
Thanks for your help!

Alessandro Lanari
