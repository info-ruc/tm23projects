Since the HB does not support Java/RMI/TCP etc it's not likely that 
you'll see Jini on the HB any time soon. However, it would be fairly
straightforward to create Jini proxies on a host computer that act
on behalf on the HB functions. I plan to do this eventually, will 
share some info here. Nice thing is that there is a Java env for 
the HB, so the Java proxy can communicate with Java on the HB thru
the serial port.
