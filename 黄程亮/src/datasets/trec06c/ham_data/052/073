You can try some IO cards.  I don't know of any that connect to the ports
but I know most can plug into ISA/PCI ports and have programmable I/O
ports taht can be used by various differnt languages.

I remeber somthing in the lines of "PC Systems Handbook for Scientists and
Enginners" I think that's the name.

Do a search and maybe they have an online catalog.
