   I'll vouch for the efficacy of the Fascinating Electronics board.  I
got one years ago after reading the series in Electronics Now/Radio-Electronics
using it as a weather monitor.  It works fine connected to an HP48 calculator
for control of I/O as well as some on board Stepper motor drivers.  I used
the steppers with Lego gears but it really is overkill since there's so much
free play in the Lego plastic gears.

   The Parallel port on the IBM style PC is one of those non-standard standards
that seem to change with every new system they bring out.
