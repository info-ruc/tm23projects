hello,

I am a fourth year EE student at the University of British Columbia.
For my team project, we have to construct a robot which is able to learn
a maze and then find the quickest way to navigate through it.  I was
thinking of only use infrared technology for the proximity sensors, as
opposed to sonar.    Could you provide me with some information
regarding that topic?

Thanks,

Gloria
