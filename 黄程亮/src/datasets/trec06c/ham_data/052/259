  Actually, the way the zillion keys work as soon as you indicate that you
would like to exclude some keys and not others then you have to
specifically declare all the keys you want.  This however wouldn't solve
your problem, you are getting blocked by the method of input which is
masking off anything from the PIO but the lowest three bits, you will need
a <mip 17> (I think mip is still octal, it's default is 7) and no <vzk>
keywords.
