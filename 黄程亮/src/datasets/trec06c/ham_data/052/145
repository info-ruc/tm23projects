  Yeah, quotes around strings are not exactly consistent through DMDX, I
couldn't make my mind up as I was writing the thing whether to make them
compulsory or not and so have wound up with the awful situation where they
are needed in some places and not allowed in others and even I have no idea
where.  I tend to use quotes when in doubt, if anyone finds places where
they don't work tell me and I'll change the code so we can migrate to the
quotes everywhere scenario (old item files that work and don't have quotes
won't be broken however).
