Sorry about this mess below -- this only applies to people reading the HB
list via the LUGNET server.  The message below was auto-posted by the server
when the new newsgroup (which is being gatewayed with the mailing list) was
created.  I forgot to disable echo on the initial two auto-post messages.

Fred will probably post some general information tomorrow...we're almost done
creating the gateway.
