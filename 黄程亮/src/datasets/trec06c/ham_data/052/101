I disassembled quite some (lego) models, I also use differential steering. I
position the wheels like most models on a square (so width and length of
wheel base is equal). Funny thing about a square is that a circle can be
drawn from the middle crossing the 4 corners. This is your ideal turning
circle (if the wheels were spheres).
