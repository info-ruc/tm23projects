I'm now asked to write an introductory article of Plan 9 for Japanese
readers who are supposed to have some skills to write programs.
I suppose this is the first (probably) oppotunity to read a comprehensive
introduction to Plan 9 writeen in Japanese for such Japanese readers.

Now, then, I'm wondering what extent I can refer to the source codes
to write this article.   If it's entirely impossible, it might be a very boring
article for such readers.

When I searched such an example in the papers written by you from
Bell Labs., I can find many examples to show pieces of source codes.
However, those are written by the authors themselves, and it IS
different from my situation.

Then, I'd like to ask you whether it's possible to refer to the source codes
when it is shown not to reveal the entire sources, in other words,
to quate them only to show thier flow structures of the coding.
