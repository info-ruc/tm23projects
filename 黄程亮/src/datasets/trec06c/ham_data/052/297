Now, I recieved two good answers for my problems.

1) Built an H-Bridge
2) Use the LMD18200

Now has any one any documentation on an easy H bridge that I could build

without wasting much time?
The same goes for the LMD18200, I understand that is not compatible with

the HB, has any one built a small circuit which would interface the HB
and LMD18200

Oh yeah, one more thing, how about connecting a 5 ohm resistor in series

with a DC motor and there are 2 amps flowing, then the resistor is
dissipating 20 watts of heat.

Now I could have a higher value for the resistor, like 7, 10 ohms, I
think that could do it too!

Is this an easier way???


HAS ANY ONE USED MOTORS RATED OVER 1 AMP WITH THE HANDY BOARD?
