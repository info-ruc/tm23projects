  Addendum to my last post.  For my money, I would get the LiteOn unit instead.
Its less fragile (nifty metal can) and has the same pinout as the Sharp GP1U58Y
units, and you can get them in a variety of frequencies at 
http://www.digikey.com.  Part Number 160-1153, in stock about $2.50 each.  
Note!!!  For both the LiteOn and Sharp IS1U60 parts pay attention to that 47uf 
cap and 47 ohm resistor low-pass filter, you will never get it to work right 
without it!  Check out my web page http://www.verinet.com/~dlc/botlinks.htm and
bonk on the "all in one" stamp II robot board for a schematic setup for this 
part.

have fun,
DLC
