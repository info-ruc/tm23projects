Thanks Fred,
Yes, we have several working ones that download and boot just fine.
In fact we're going ahead with these, but it means we don't have
1 bot per student.
 
Since the download appears to work, and just the boot does not,
I'm stumped. It's also odd that both boards are behaving the same way.
We'll be doing some more comparisons to the working boards later.

Is there any way to access a monitor level function on this thing that
would let us peek and poke around in memory to see if it really
is accessible? I'm thinking that it appears the serial connection
works, so can I talk to it directly my self?
thanks,
ed
