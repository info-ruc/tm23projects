One user (out of so far about 100 MAPI accounts) in our company reported
high figures like you mentioned, but in his case it's in the 'Drafts'
folder. (And it's our Director of finance).

What's up with the very large messages counts users occasionally get
with MAPI accounts (like in the 4 billion range)? Are we the only site
experiencing this phenomenon? Is there a known cure? Or should I take
the time to log the MAPI account of a user who's experiencing the
problem?

Thanks,
Bret
