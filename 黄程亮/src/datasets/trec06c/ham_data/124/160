Maybe you could do this:
    - Force all accounts to use the trash bin
    - Modify your webskins to remove the Empty Trash Button and the=20
Delete button for the trash folder
    - Force the "On Logout Remove from Trash if Older than" setting to=20
one month
    - Tell everyone the messages in trash are removed when they are that =

old.

However, if the item that has been deleted falls outside of the retention
period, you are far better off in CGP world! Within Exchange if a user
requires a message/document to be restored from backup that happens to fall
outside the "deleted item retention" period, it may involve a complete
system rebuild on other hardware to do so, just for one message! This will
occur if full system backups are taken and not mailbox backups. The pro's
and con's of each are for the Exchange list :-)   Obviously the config
within CGP is totally different.  If you need to restore a message,
depending on the file store format, you only really need to restore a single
file from backup into a recovery mailbox and you're done.

Perhaps an option to limit the size of "recovery storage" 
would help, but then if one user deleted that amount of space 
at once, all other users would lose their recovery option if 
the recovery storage were shared.

Such an option would have to work with MAPI or maybe webmail. 
Somehow the server would have to store the account name in an 
index so a user could "undo" his delete action without you 
having to review all the messages in the recovery file. 
Either that or keep a separate recovery file for each user 
that had a separate storage limit from his regular account. 
I'm sure it could be done. Whether Stalker thinks it's a 
worthwhile feature to add is another matter.
