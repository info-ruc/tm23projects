Challenge</span>:
</b><br>

Large corporations often hire consultants to conduct quarterly penetration
(DDoS)
<br>
testing on specific segments of their corporate network. This testing can
cost over<br>
hundreds of thousands of dollars, and also exposes the network to many
potential
<br>
disruptions. These disruptions are the result of the intense DDoS attacks
testers<br>
can impose on live networks in order to isolate vulnerabilities and
weaknesses.<br>
Since the network is constantly changing, and DDoS attacks are rarely
dispersed<br>
from a centralized location, the penetration test results often become
nullified 
and<br>
end up being limited to a small portion of the total network.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>The Skybox Solution:<br>

Security</font></span><font size="2"> performs accurate and non-intrusive
DDoS attacks 
across a larger<br>
portion of the corporate network. The tests are modeled and analyzed
through an<br>
automated process via our large botnet network rather than manually
performed on 
a<br>
live network. As a result, the tests are repeated rigorously on a scheduled
basis
<br>
without any fear of network disruption. Through DDoS attack and access
simulation,
<br>
vulnerability exposures as well as security control weaknesses are revealed
instantly.</font></font><font size="2" face="Arial"><br>
DDoS attack simulation discovers all possible attack scenarios and reveals
the step<br>
by step process that an attacker or worm may follow. It illustrates
specific vulnerabilities<br>

to be exploited and network access traversed for each exploitable path.
Access simulation<br>
calculates network access privileges determined by firewall and routing
configuration.<br>
Our botnet helps characterize the interconnectivity between any two given
points, 
reporting<br>
not just whether access is possible, but also the detailed path to reach a
final 
destination.<br>
Based on these combined results, security personnel are able to determine
what additional<br>
DDoS attacks are necessary and where to deploy our organizations
penetration testers.</font></p>
