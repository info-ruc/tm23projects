Apple QuickTime Vulnerabilities

   Original release date: May 12, 2006
   Last revised: --
   Source: US-CERT


Systems Affected

   Apple QuickTime on systems running

     * Apple Mac OS X
     * Microsoft Windows


Overview

   Apple QuickTime contains multiple vulnerabilities. Exploitation of
   these vulnerabilities could allow a remote attacker to execute
   arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service condition.


I. Description

   Apple QuickTime 7.1 resolves multiple vulnerabilities in the way
   different types of image and media files are handled. An attacker
   could exploit these vulnerabilities by convincing a user to access
   a specially crafted image or media file with a vulnerable version
   of QuickTime. Since QuickTime configures most web browsers to
   handle QuickTime media files, an attacker could exploit these
   vulnerabilities using a web page.

   For more information, please refer to the Vulnerability Notes.


II. Impact

   The impacts of these vulnerabilities could allow an remote,
   unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code or commands, and
   cause a denial-of-service condition. For further information,
   please see the Vulnerability Notes.


III. Solution

Upgrade

   Upgrade to QuickTime 7.1. This and other updates for Mac OS X are
   available via Apple Update.

Disable QuickTime in your web browser

   An attacker may be able to exploit this vulnerability by persuading
   a user to access a specially crafted file with a web
   browser. Disabling QuickTime in your web browser will defend
   against this attack vector.  For more information, refer to the
   Securing Your Web Browser document.
