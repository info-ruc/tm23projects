Teodor,

I'm sure there is very complex way of doing this in DMDX, but here's a
simple solution that should work.

	In the parameter line, you specify the number of items, which would
be 30 plus the number of practice items that contain a clockon signal (*).
let's suppose that's 6 practice items:

<n 36> <s 200>

We also set the scramble block size to a value bigger than the total number
of items.  The item file consists of all 180 test items, plus the 6 practice
items.

After the 30th test item, you include the following:

$0 <branch 1000>;

The very last item in the item file should be:

$1000 "That's the end.";$

The branch instruction tells DMDX to ignore all items up until 1000.  The
importance of specifying the number of items is that it allows you to save
the data (although this may no longer be necessary -- I haven't checked).

	--k.i.f.
