MS can do that because Exchange is somewhat DB-driven and has provision=20
for this. Deleting a message is just flagging it as deleted, and the=20
date it has been "deleted" is recorded. When the "number of days to keep =

deleted items" delay is elapsed, messages are gone.
CGP is file-driven. When a message is deleted, the file is deleted=20
(mdir) or the MIME text of this emssage is erased (mbox). Unless you=20
have a backup the message can't be restored.
