Hi FGP seminar,

I've graded the final projects.  You can pick them up from
my assistant, Amy Levin, in ACES 3.112.  Her hours are
normally 9:00am to 3:30pm, with a half-hour off sometime
around lunch.

For most of you, your grade in the class is the same as
your grade on the final project, but for a couple of
people it is off by a 1/3 grade due to adjustment for
class writeups.  You can check your class grades using
the normal online system as soon as it makes them
available.  I've already entered them.

Thanks again to all of you for making this a great seminar.

Bill
