It seems that Outlook, or the MAPI connector, decreased the message 
counter under zero. When represented as an unsigned integer, -1 is

What's up with the very large messages counts users occasionally get
with MAPI accounts (like in the 4 billion range)? Are we the only site
experiencing this phenomenon? Is there a known cure? Or should I take
the time to log the MAPI account of a user who's experiencing the
problem?

Thanks,
