Washington, DC and Chicago, IL =96 May 11, 2006 =96=20
The upcoming SPARC-ACRL forum on emerging issues=20

During the past several years, Open Data has=20

opportunities in the sharing, review, and=20

play a key role in seeing that the scholarly=20
communication system evolves in a way that=20
supports the needs of scholars and the academic enterprise as a whole.

As Open Data moves to the forefront of scholarly=20
communication, librarians, administrators, and=20
researchers will be responsible for considering=20
new access policies for data and data curation=20
issues.  This SPARC-ACRL forum will introduce=20
Open Data as an emerging focus, explore the=20
challenges of managing the data deluge, and aid=20
participants in crafting their own digital data=20
preservation and curation policies.

Speakers will include:
    * Christopher Greer, Cyberinfrastructure=20
Advisor, Office of the Assistant Director for=20
Biological Sciences, National Science Foundation
    * Robert Hanisch, Project Manager, Space Telescope Science Institute
