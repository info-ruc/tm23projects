Hi Jonathan,
I am hoping you might consider (with my sponsorship if needed) an
additional method to set up the IO card.  I am running an experiment
that needs 18 output lines (8 for sending a trigger code to a physio
amp and 10 for controlling a shock generator) along with 2 input lines
(for two buttons).  I know that it is possible to split the C port
into C-upper and C-lower (two four bit "sub"-port).  At a minimum,
would it be possible to provide a queued device that configures A, B
and C-lower for output and C-upper for input.  (control port
configured as 136 DEC; from page 12 of the measurement computing
docs).

Even more flexible would be if you would provide a command that could
be inserted into the header to send any of the available configuration
codes to the control port when initializing the IO card.  That would
allow anyone to set up the card for all the various combo that are
available.

An added benefit of this would be that C could be then used regularly
for input rather than output.  You might remember an earlier email I
sent to the list about problems with the way that the C port handles
output.  It appears that the lower and upper subport on C are not
perfectly in synch.  B/c of this we get (very infrequent) errors when
using all 8 bits of C to either send triggers (we sometimes get
triggers that only include 4 of the 8 bits) or to control other
devices (our shock generator infrequently reads the C port incorrectly
and administers shock intensities that only represent 4 of the 8 bits
on C used to indicate intensity).

Is this possible and are you willing to make either of these changes?

Thanks J
