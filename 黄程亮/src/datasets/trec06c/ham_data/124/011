Kiringai,

My understanding of this fund is that, although it's a promising model for
development in general (such as building schools, developing infrastructure
etc.), it excludes a key piece of microfinance by restricting the
possibility of funds being used for any personal awards.  More specifically
the Act states that:	

"A project or any part thereof which involve personal awards to any person
in cash or in kind, shall be excluded from the list of projects submitted in
accordance with section 12 of the Act."
