Hello

I am Dr. ANDREW COLA, the Director For Projects with the Ministry of 
Petroleum. First and Foremost, I apologize for using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business 
of this magnitude, but this is due to the confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. I got 
your contact from the Nigerian Export and Promotion Council I have decided to seek a confidential 
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and 
hope you will keep it as top secret because of the nature of the transaction. 

Within the Ministry of Petroluem where I work as a Director, and with 
the co-operation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling 
Twenty Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$28,500,000.00) which we want 
to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a foreign company who will receive the said 
funds on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More also, we are 
handicapped in this circumstances as the Nigerian Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to 
operate offshore account hence your importance in this whole transaction. This amount 
US$28,500,000.00 represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry 
by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual 
contract cost has been paid to the original contractor, leaving behind the balance in the tune of the said 
amount which we have by principle gotten approval by Key Tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T.) to any 
foreign bank account you will provide by filling an application through the Justice Ministry here in Nigeria 
for the transfer of rights and priviledges of the former contractor to you. 

I have the authority of my partner involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the 
transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the $28.5M, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and 
miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe on your part provided you treat it with utmost 
secrecy and confidentiality. 

Also, your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. 
Endeavour to contact me immediately through my direct email address for confidential reason as we 
progress I will give you my telephone and fax number whether or not you are interested in this deal. 

If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. And please 
remember to treat this matter as very confidential because we will not comprehend any form of exposures 
as we are still in active Government service and also remember that time is of the essence in this 
business. 

I await your response in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 

Yours faithfully, 
Dr. ANDREW COLA
