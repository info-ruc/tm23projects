   Yeah, a solution I'd rather implement but that is more complicated is to 
allow multiple output devices.  I've thought about it before and rejected 
it out of hand as too much work and was thinking about at again after your 
inquiry and it's still a mess I don't immediately see how to solve.  But it 
would be a more general purpose thing than rearranging output ports.  If 
this isn't attractive to you or wouldn't work let me know.

   Another solution that crosses my mind is to use pio12output24 and use 
port A for one of your devices and B for the other and then to hack up a 
USB gamepad for response buttons.
