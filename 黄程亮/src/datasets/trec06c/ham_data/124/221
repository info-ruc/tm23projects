Sybil Attack
In this paper the author discusses the effects of faulty or hostile remote
computing elements, which could present more than one identity and can
control a portion of the network and undermine the redundancy in the
system and cause failures. Systems usually utilize replication of tasks
across multiple remote sites for failure prevention or fragment the tasks
across multiple nodes for privacy. The author argues that a distributed
environment needs a centralized authority to prevent such attacks. However
the presence of a centralized authority would destroy the anonymity of the
nodes in the network that undermines the peer-to-peer network. Sybil
attack or forging multiple identities in a distributed certifying
environment as opposed to a centralized certifying authority could be
compromised at startup by malignant nodes that join the network initially
and provide certification for other bad nodes. The author states that
based on a PKI based solution with a centralized certifying authority is
the solution. However the author has not taken into effect the group
effect of good certifying nodes and bad certifying nodes and hasn’t done
enough study before denouncing a distributed certifying system. A
distributed certifying system is both practical and reliable with slight
modifications where a centralized server only monitors and certifies a
certain set of certifying nodes. AS the trust in the network spreads any
certifying node or set of nodes that is malignant reports to the a set of
its neighbor certifying nodes of malignant nodes and such certifying nodes
can lose its rights to provide certification and can be revoked by a
central certifying authority. Thus the central certifying node only takes
action when it receives reports of malignant nodes that have been
certified as otherwise and in which case it goes for the node that
certified it. Thus in course of time a set of certified nodes would emerge
which are not malignant. Thus a co-operative certifying authority would
work where the distributed would fail.

Eclipse Attacks & Secure Routing for Structured peer to peer networks
Eclipse attacks are more general than Sybil attacks are usually launched
after a Sybil attack where a portion of the network is controlled and the
efforts are made to disrupt the routing in the overlay network. The main
purpose is to prevent correct overlay operation.
In Eclipse attacks the attacker even if controlling only a small fraction
of the nodes can still launch an attack by manipulating the overlay
algorithm. In an eclipse attack eventually the attacker gets control over
the whole network. The authors suggests an approach based on choosing
neighbors based on a threshold value for the number of in connections and
out connections for each neighbor to be added as a neighbor. This limits
the attack since the degree of the attacking nodes must be higher than the
average degree of number of neighbors and number of neighbors refereeing
to each attacking node. So when a value is chosen that is below that of
the average for the network then the attack can be thwarted.
Implementation of the protocol is done by enforcing degree bounds by
auditing the neighbor nodes for its in degree and based on if it exceeds
the threshold it removes the node from the list or maintains it in its
list besides adding a random nonce to ensure the authenticity of the
replies from the neighbor nodes. In the paper Secure Routing the authors 
follow up on the earlier paper where Eclipse attacks were discussed and
dwells into the impact on Pastry CAN, Chord and Tapestry and proposes a
secure routing protocol that is based on sending multiple messages and in
triggering failures in the routes where the messages timed out without a
response and is based on the assumption that the average density of the
good nodes is more than that of faulty nodes.
