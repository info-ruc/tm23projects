Measurements Study of peer to Peer file sharing Systems
In This paper the authors analyze two Peer-to-Peer networks Napster and
Gnutella and do detailed measurements on the bandwidths and the number of
files shared and also on the latencies between hosts. Also the number of
nodes that shows a lower upload speed is also studied. The bottleneck
bandwidth that does not only depend on the upload speed of the node but
also depends on the bandwidth of the routing path and so affects the
bandwidth measurements. Also it was observed that 25% of the nodes did not
choose to report their bandwidth and this is attributed to the lack of a
penalizing mechanism for providing low upload speeds. Also the
observations show that both Napster and Gnutella networks show highly
similar percentage distribution of bandwidth for their hosts though
Gnutella nodes have in general more bandwidth than those of Napster
because 50% of users in Napster and 60% of users in Gnutella use broadband
connections. Also the study shows the number of nodes required to break
down the Gnutella network and how the network responds under attack. It
was observed that for a node degree of 20, 60% of the nodes would need to
be taken down for the overlay to be fragmented. Another interesting take
from this paper is the skew shown in Napster downloads where though low
bandwidth nodes have higher percentage of downloads than their actual
participation in the network showing that high bandwidth nodes provide
much the download bandwidth for downloading content.

Measurement, Modeling, and Analysis of a Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Workload
	In this paper the authors analyze the Kazaa network for effect of file
sharing workloads and the effect of system parameters and the impact of
locality awareness in Kazaa. The most important observation is made on
the behavior of users who show patience for long downloads spanning days
due to the slow nature of the network. Also the authors show that the
popularity of objects have a short lifespan and the popularity keeps on
transferring to new objects introduced into the system. Thus the users
responses to the Kazaa network is widely different from the Internet
where spontaneous responses are expected as compared to the Kazaa
network. Also it was observed in the study that larger objects tend to
age faster than smaller objects and arrival of newer objects play an
important role in peer-to-peer systems as does newer content play an
important role in the dynamics of the web and performance in the file
sharing systems decrease over time in the absence of introduction of
newer objects. Another interesting observation made by the author is that
Kazaa does not follow Zip’s distribution.
