Good Day,
Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet 
your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Dr. 
William, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank, 
here in London, England.
One of our accounts, with holding balance of 
Â£15,000,000 (Fifteen Million pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last 
operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the 
owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on 
the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham;you can view 
this CNN website 

http://edition.cnn.
com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.

plane/ for details on the crash.
Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this 
money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the 
existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from 
the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into 
the UK.I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank 
officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal 
with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the 
next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you 
after necessary processes have been followed.

This transaction is 
totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does 
not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal
act.On your interest, let me hear from you.

Warm Regards,
Dr. William.
