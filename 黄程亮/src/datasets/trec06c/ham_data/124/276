Dear Friend,

After going through your profile it pleases me to contact you and to inform you of my desire to go into business with
you.
My Name is Madam Villaran. Nenita. A complete citizen of
the philippines,widow to the late James Nenita who died on 15th of May 2004.
 
My husband fell sick and he was flown to France for treatment but later died of ulcer and he has been buried.
 
I inherited a total sum of 12.3 million dollars from my late husband, this money which is concealed in a metallic trunk box is deposited with a security and finance company in Abidjan- Cote d'Ivoire.  
 
This deposit was coded under a secret arrangement as a family treasure.This means that the security company does not know the content of this trunk box that was deposited under a diplomatic coverage for safe keeping.
 
My main purpose of sending you this mail is because of the way I found you and perhaps trustworthy to give you this priority of shipping the box of money to any address that you think is very secure and save in your country with your
percentage of which we shall chat on soon.
 
In fact, since the death of my husband, his brothers has been seriously chasing me around with constant treats, trying to suppress me so that they might have the documents of his landed properties and confiscate them. They have successfully collected all his properties, yet they never stopped there, they told me to surrender all bank account of my late husband,which I did, but I never disclose to them this deposit with the security company in Abidjan- Cote d'Ivoire, because this is where my future and destiny lies upon.  The family of my late husband never aware of the secret existence of this deposit which My late husband deposited  with the security
company and they can never be aware of it.
 
Out of fear of my late husbands family, and when the situation becomes uncontrollable because of pressure on me  I decide to look for a trustworthy person who could assist me retrieve this box of money from the security company for onward lodgement into his account for the purpose of future investment.Consider my situation as a widow and come to my rescue.
 
There is need for urgent action because I'm paying $50 dollars per day as a demurrage to the security company for safe keeping this consignment.
I give thanks immensely for your co-operation as I look
forward to hear from you soon.Please send your reply to:nenita_vill2001@yahoo.com

Madam Villaran. Nenita.
