Doesn't help if the user is on MAPI and they right click on Deleted
Items and empty it. The only way to save it at that point is for CGPro
to have some backend recovery system, which currently it doesn't.

Maybe you could do this:
    - Force all accounts to use the trash bin
    - Modify your webskins to remove the Empty Trash Button and the
Delete button for the trash folder
    - Force the "On Logout Remove from Trash if Older than" setting to
one month
    - Tell everyone the messages in trash are removed when they are that
old.

What is being asked for is an archive/recovery mechanism like that 

provided by Exchange. The question has already been asked 

      

by some of 

    

the users "If Exchange can recover deleted files, why 

      

aren't we using 

    

Exchange?"

 <http://www.windowsitpro.com/Article/ArticleID/13684/13684.html>
<http://www.windowsitpro.com/Article/ArticleID/13684/13684.html>



What I have learned so far is that there is no equivalent 

      

feature in 

    

CGP.

      

Any such feature would need to be optional because it 

essentially means storing every deleted message for every 

local account for a pre-determined amount of time. For large 

sites, the storage requirement for this could be huge. 

Perhaps an option to limit the size of "recovery storage" 

would help, but then if one user deleted that amount of space 

at once, all other users would lose their recovery option if 

the recovery storage were shared.



Such an option would have to work with MAPI or maybe webmail. 

Somehow the server would have to store the account name in an 

index so a user could "undo" his delete action without you 

having to review all the messages in the recovery file. 

Either that or keep a separate recovery file for each user 

that had a separate storage limit from his regular account. 

I'm sure it could be done. Whether Stalker thinks it's a 

worthwhile feature to add is another matter.
