Even if CGP would support an exchange-like recovery feature, this would=20

These are good points. I don't have any idea how Exchange 'really'
works and the insight is helpful. Restoring a message from backup (in
our case, tape backup) would seem like a difficult and time-consuming
task.

The idea that emptying the trash permanently deletes a message -
rendering it unrecoverable is simple to understand and would probably
acceptable if we could provide much more disk space to the users.
Currently, we allow 80MB per account. Darn Google for starting the 1Gig
storage concept.
