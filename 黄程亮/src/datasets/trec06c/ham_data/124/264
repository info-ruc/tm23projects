Overcast:
Overcast is a collection of nodes paced at strategic locations in a per to
peer network to implement an abstraction over the existing network to
provide a reliable and adaptable routing mechanism where the system’s
functionality can be provided on an incremental basis. It attempts to
reduce bandwidth requirements by replication. Overcast attempts to reduce
the sending of same data over the same network multiple times to reduce
the bandwidth requirements for multicast systems especially for
broadcasting mediums for broadcasting large video files. Overcast builds
distribution trees that to create high bandwidth channels from the source
node to all nodes by building an adaptable distribution tree with a single
root. When a user requests a particular video file that would be
advertised at a common source such as a web page the requests gets
redirected to a node that is at a close proximity and content is served
from that node. However the system does not implement a breakup of the
contents of the video file across servers but merely replicates the file.
Thus if a particular node gets choked due to a sudden increase in requests
from a region the system would be slow to react to the change and could
fail. This implementation also assumes that the organization distributing
networks would have its own set of nodes spread across the regions it
provides service to. In other words it is more of a distributed load
balancing protocol where each server handles the complete service for one
particular request for a file. This paper really handles issues more with
content distribution for service providers rather than for peer-to-peer
systems since any node on a public network that is made into a
distribution node just because it has a high bandwidth would resist the
usage and would limit the applicability. This system does not utilize it
resources properly because of the tree architecture and in the authors own
words “If a child fails to contact its parents within a preset interval,
the parent will assume the child and all of its descendants have died”. So
if a set of immediate child nodes leaves he system the whole network would
just disappear for that content being distributed. The authors claim that
they chose the parents not to initiate contact with their children to
enable it to cross firewalls easily. The author has not looked into other
topologies such as a grid or a multi ring topology that are more stable to
nodes being pulled out of the network. Finally the authors uses
certificates for authenticity and availability of the child nodes but
fails to consider the effect of a malignant node which might modify the
contents of the file. Thus this application is limited to private networks
whose nodes are spread across the Internet.
