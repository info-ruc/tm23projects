Scholarly Publishers Oppose Senate Bill=20
Unwarranted measure would have severe=20
consequences for publishers, scientific=20
societies, researchers, and U.S. taxpayers

New York, May 9, 2006 - Professional and=20
scholarly publishers firmly oppose S.2695, the=20
"Federal Research Public Access Act of 2006"=20
introduced by Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) and Sen.=20
Joseph Lieberman (D-CT). The proposed legislation=20
would require the majority of recipients of U.S.=20
federal research agency funds to make their=20
findings free within six months of publication.=20
Publishers argue that the legislation, if passed,=20
will seriously jeopardize the integrity of the=20
scientific publishing process, and is a=20
duplicative effort that places an unwarranted burden on research=
 investigators.

According to the publishers, the provisions of=20
S.2695 threaten to undermine the essential value=20
of peer review by removing the publishers'=20
incentive and ability to sustain investments in a=20
range of scientific, technical, and medical=20
publishing activities. The proposed legislation=20
comes at a time when increased public access to=20
government-funded research is already occurring=20
in a voluntary and highly effectiv0=7F=9D e manner=20
through a variety of publisher-initiated mechanisms and cooperative=
 approaches.

"Full public access to scientific articles based=20
on government funding has always been central to=20
our mission.  Competition demands it and timely=20
access to quality peer-reviewed journals is=20
fundamental to the scientific process," said Dr.=20
Brian D. Crawford, chairman of the Professional=20
Scholarly Publishing Division of the Association=20
of American Publishers (AAP-PSP), and a Senior=20
Vice President with the American Chemical=20
Society. Americans have easy access to scientific=20
and medical literature through public libraries,=20
state universities, existing private-sector=20
online database, as well as through their=20
professional, academic, or business affiliations,=20
low-cost online individual article sales, and=20
innovative health literacy initiatives such as patientINFORM.

"The Cornyn-Lieberman bill would create=20
unnecessary costs for taxpayers, place an=20
unwarranted burden on research investigators, and=20
expropriate the value-added investments made by=20
scientific publishers-many of them not-for-profit=20
associations who depend on publishing income to=20
support pursuit of their scholarly missions,=20
including education and outreach for the next=20
generation of U.S. scientists," continued Dr.=20
Crawford. "If enacted, S.2695 could well have the=20
unintended consequence of compromising or=20
destroying the independent system of peer review=20
that ensures the integrity of the very research=20
the U.S. Government is trying to support and disseminate."

Dr. Crawford explained that publishers invest=20
hundreds of millions of dollars each year in=20
publishing and disseminating peer-reviewed=20
journals. These investments ensure the quality of=20
U.S. taxpayer-supported scientific research by=20
subjecting all articles to a rigorous technical=20
review by experts in specialized fields prior to=20
publication and pay for the development of=20
technological innovations that enable broad web=20
dissemination. "Mandating that journal articles=20
be made freely available on government websites=20
so soon after their publication will be a=20
powerful disincentive for publishers to continue=20
these substantial investments," explained Dr.=20
Crawford.  He said publishers are concerned that=20
S.2695 would result in a significant loss of=20
revenue from subscriptions, licensing, and=20
individual article sales, thereby making it=20
difficult for them to sustain and recoup the=20
investments they make in support of scientific communication.

The proposed bill was introduced on the first=20
anniversary of the National Institutes of=20
Health's (NIH) adoption of its Public Access=20
policy, which encourages the posting of journal=20
articles based on NIH-funded research within 12=20
months of publication on its existing=20
PubMedCentral database -- a policy that gained=20
PSP/AAP member publisher support and yet remains=20
in its early stages of government-led=20
implementation.  A departure from the NIH's=20
voluntary approach, the Cornyn/Lieberman bill=20
would mandate that 11 federal agencies create new=20
systems and data repositories to enforce internet=20
posting of government funded research within six=20
months of publication.  As the NIH's=20
implementation of the policy has not yet=20
progressed to the point where its impact can be=20
assessed, publishers view the introduction of the=20
Cornyn-Lieberman proposal as premature.

"No evidentiary record exists, and no impact=20
studies have been conducted, to document the=20
long-term cost to tax payers of government=20
agencies developing yet another system to promote=20
public access.  Moreover, no consideration has=20
been given to what the impact of this government=20
mandate will be on publishers and scholarly=20
societies ability to maintain their broad base of=20
library and other customers worldwide and invest=20
in independent peer review systems." said Allan=20
Adler, the Association of American Publishers'=20
Vice President for Legal and Government=20
Affairs.  He cautioned, "Responsible major U.S.=20
government policy revisions must be based on a=20
solid, researched understanding of the long-range=20
impact of any policy changes.  This perspective=20
is conspicuously absent from the proposed=20
legislation, which would cause severe harm to the=20
publishing community, scientific societies, and taxpayers."

Mr. Adler said that publishers and scholarly=20
societies urge that an independent study be=20
conducted to measure the potential impact that=20
any changes to the existing NIH policy or the=20
adoption of the proposed Cornyn-Lieberman=20
legislation would have on scientific quality, the=20
peer review process, and the viability of=20
numerous journals and societies--as well as the=20
additio0=7F=9D nal costs that would need to be shouldered by taxpayers.
