Dear Colleagues,



Formal talks on Monday -- a tribute to members resolve:

Members will know that on Monday, AUT and NATFHE will at last be meeting
UCEA for formal negotiations to address the unions' pay claim. The fact
that these talks are taking place at all is a tribute to AUT and NATFHE
members who have demonstrated unity, resolve and discipline in prosecuting
this industrial action. It is only because of the significant impact of the
unions' action that the employers have agreed to formal talks with an
improved offer. We will keep members updated on progress and notify you of
any developments.



Aberdeen and St Andrews reject local pay offers as employers lose patience
with UCEA:

In a decisive day yesterday, both Aberdeen and St Andrews Local AUT
branches rejected local pay offers touted by their managements. At Aberdeen
a General Meeting of 200 members voted overwhelmingly to express 100%
support for the national negotiators in seeking to resolve the dispute at
an early date in a national agreement which addresses our pay claim.



At St Andrews, the Local Association informed management that it would not
accept the local offer, following recognition that its email consultation
was not in accordance with rules and that the majority of members had not
expressed a view. St Andrews University's unfortunate and desperate attempt
to bypass the frustrating delays caused by UCEA's intransigence have
clearly failed, yet more evidence of the enormous impact of our action.

To read an AUT statement giving a full account of these developments in
Scotland go to:
http://www.aut.org.uk/media/pdf/o/6/aut_localoffers_5may06.pdf



Scottish Executive tells the employers, 'the money's there, talk now':

The political pressure on UCEA was also ratcheted up a notch this week as
the Scottish Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning, Allan
Wilson, confirmed that there was 'ample scope for both parties to sit
around the table and hammer out a settlement that will take the sector
forward and protect academic rates of pay and conditions of service'. Mr
Wilson's intervention contradicts once again the employers' pleas of
poverty and demonstrates that the employers are politically isolated. There
is no obstacle to an improved offer on Monday and we look forward to UCEA
recognising this once and for all.



AUT deeply concerned at unprofessional University contingency plans:

Following the widely reported move by Keele University to allow students to
graduate having completed only two thirds of their final year, AUT general
secretary Sally Hunt condemned the move as threatening quality in order to
avoid settling the dispute. She was echoed in this by the Law Society, who
voiced their concern that such contingency plans would compromise national
standards of degrees.



Sally Hunt has today written to twenty statutory and professional bodies,
including the Royal Society and the General Medical Council raising AUT's
concerns that other universities, such as Newcastle and Liverpool are
considering similar actions. The letter asks that professional bodies write
to VCs and to Universities UK to discourage them from any reckless measures
that will jeopardize degree standards.



AUT welcomes Johnson back to education and reminds him of commitment on
staff pay:

The Association of University Teachers (AUT) today welcomed the appointment
of Alan Johnson MP as secretary of state for education. Mr Johnson
committed money from the new top-up fee regime to staff pay when minister
for higher education in 2004. Commenting on Mr Johnson's appointment, AUT
general secretary, Sally Hunt, said:

"Alan Johnson is a hugely respected MP and minister and, of course, a
former trade union leader. The current pay dispute is at a critical stage
and we are very fortunate that the man who told the truth about
universities' commitment to staff pay is back in education.



"We have repeatedly asked the employers to honour their commitment to use
the new money they lobbied for to sort out staff pay. The employers'
attempts to wriggle out of that commitment are as shameful as they are
deceitful. To save themselves from any further embarrassment the employers
must use Monday's pay talks to honour their prior commitment on pay and the
more recent ones about making staff a fair offer. A failure to do so will
let down everyone involved in this dispute and only cause them further
embarrassment."



180 MPs have now signed the EDM - keep up the political pressure -- get
your MP involved:

The number of MPs who have publicly backed our campaign has now topped 180.
This is a fantastic result. We know that over recent weeks, dozens of
members have written to their MPs -- thanks if you've already done so. If
you haven't, please do so now. Every bit of heat we can turn on the
employers will help. Use the draft letter here to contact your MP, ask them
to sign the EDM and urge them to write to UCEA - and please let us know
you've been in touch with them:

Select Committee criticises Sussex VC:

The Science and Technology Select Committee yesterday published its report
on the VC of Sussex University's attempt to close the Chemistry Department.
The damning report accuses troubled VC Alasdair Smith of running down the
department over a number of years, failing to replace staff, failing to
consult the Head of Department over the future of Chemistry and failing to
inform HEFCE of his intentions until only one week before the public
announcement. The report makes it clear that there is no basis for closing
Chemistry.



The report is also highly critical of HEFCE's lack of power to intervene
and on universities' ability to deliver the government's objective of
protecting strategically important subjects, urging that the government
consider stronger mechanisms for restraining the open market in Higher
Education provision if it wants to promote Research and Development fit for
a knowledge economy. You can read the report in full at the following link:
http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Education/documents/2006/05/03/susses
x.pdf



Responding to the report, Sally Hunt called for a quick final decision that
will safeguard Chemistry at Sussex and condemned VCs for the short-termist
decision-making that has thrown jobs and whole departments into crisis:



"Slamming shut the door of opportunity for current and future chemists
makes no sense at all. The proud reputation our universities enjoy
worldwide is in no small part down to the fantastic efforts of departments
such as chemistry. Has our higher education really reached the sorry state
where world class research and a university's reputation must be sacrificed
for the bottom line?"
