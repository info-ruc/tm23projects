That definitely seems to be the case with the Measurement computing
pio/dio24.  The option to just use the high word on port B doesnt
solve our problem b/c we use all 8 bits on port B and on port c to
control two separate devices.  Whichever device is controlled by port
C ends up having trouble with the two nibbles not being set at the
exactly same time.

If you are willing to break with the 5 input line tradition and
provide a device that uses A, B and C-Low for output and C-High for
input, I will definitely buy you something nice!  Can we talk more off
the list?
