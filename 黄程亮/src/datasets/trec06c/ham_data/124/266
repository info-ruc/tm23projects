Resilient Overlay Networks:
A Resilient Overlay Network (RON) is an architecture that allows
distributed applications across a network to detect and recover from path
outages and choose optimal paths for routing and redirect in case of path
outage and provide a path for communication when the underlying network
has problems in routing. RON nodes maintain and exchange information
regarding the existing routing and network status between other RON nodes
and uses this information to build forwarding table for routing packets
based on the path metrics that would include latency, packet loss and the
current available throughput. Each RON node periodically assimilates path
metrics from its neighbors and in case of outages transmits the
information to other RON nodes. Thus the protocol maintains performance
metrics on itself and also at the same time ensures that all RON nodes
have compete information unless they are isolated from the RON network.
RON networks however do not try to find the optimal routing path for
maximum throughput but instead strives to avoid paths that have a low
throughput. Thus the system is subject to selfish routing and would cause
fluctuations in network usages based on throughput. Instead if the system
were to also try to establish Nash Equilibrium in the network routes, it
would lead to a more stable routing protocol where a taxation policy based
on a utility function can be used to ensure that the system converges to
an optimal equilibrium.

One Hop Routing
In this paper the authors discuss a routing protocol where the optimal
route is discovered by sending packets across a set of randomly chosen
intermediate nodes and claims that performance matches those obtained by
using path monitoring performance metrics on the network. It is based on
detection of path failures that results in a corrective action based on
rerouting it through an alternate route. This result in polices being
formulated at the level of intermediary nodes and whenever a failed node
is detected also a resulting optimal path is also chosen and also by
selecting more than one random intermediate node the selection of bad
re-routes are avoided.
