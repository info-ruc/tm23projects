   Faintly possible.  It breaks a long standing if somewhat redundant 
DMastr convention where there are actually five input lines.  And I seem to 
recall one of the new PIO cards not supporting the split C port but I could 
be wrong there.

   Not going to happen, there are no control codes with the modern cards.

   Depends on the I/O card, some of them require two commands to write to 
the separate halves of the port and there's no way to synchronously set 
them.  The usual solution is to use the 16 bit output device and only use 
the high word which is the B port that is synchronous.

   You would need to sponsor it and it's a non-trivial amount of work.  The 
code is trivial but there are a large number of places that will need editing.
