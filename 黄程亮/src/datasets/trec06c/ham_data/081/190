Is there any reason to believe they will?

Updating the list itself is not sufficient. PS Type1 font consumers,
like ATM, and the built in font support for Type 1 fonts in Windows,
would have to be modified.  And *that* is a long term project
with significant costs (e.g. much larger built-in tables).

Also, keep in mind that Adobe has few math or symbol fonts

Many Type 1 fonts for TeX (other than math fonts) already pretty
much follow the glyph naming conventions (in some cases
additionally providing access to a glyph in more than one way
in order to deal with uncertainties about support for the standardized
glyph naming convention, so e.g. the
Euro glyph might be accessible both under the glyph name
"Euro" and under "uni20AC").
