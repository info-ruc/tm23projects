   CERT Advisory CA-2002-10 Format String Vulnerability in rpc.rwalld

Original release date: May 1, 2002
Last revised: --
Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Sun Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7, and 8

Overview

   The  rwall daemon (rpc.rwalld) is a utility that is used to listen for
   wall  requests  on  the  network. When a request is received, it calls
   wall,  which  sends  the  message  to  all terminals of a time-sharing
   system.  A  format  string  vulnerability  may  permit  an intruder to
   execute  code  with  the  privileges  of  the rwall daemon. A proof of
   concept  exploit  is  publicly  available, but we have not seen active
   scanning or exploitation of this vulnerability.

I. Description

   rpc.rwalld is a utility that listens for remote wall requests. Wall is
   used  to  send a message to all terminals of a time-sharing system. If
   the  wall command cannot be executed, the rwall daemon will display an
   error message.

   An  intruder can consume system resources and potentially prevent wall
   from  executing, which would trigger the rwall daemon's error message.
   A  format  string  vulnerability  exists in the code that displays the
   error  message.  This vulnerability may permit the intruder to execute
   code with the privileges of the rwall daemon.

   This  vulnerability  may  be  exploited  both  locally  and  remotely,
   although remote exploitation is significantly more difficult.

II. Impact

   An  intruder can execute code with the privileges of the rwall daemon,
   typically root.

III. Solution

   Apply a patch

   Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory.

   If  a patch is not available, disable the rwall daemon (rpc.rwalld) in
   inetd.conf until a patch can be applied.

   If  disabling  the rwall daemon is not an option, implement a firewall
   to  limit  access  to rpc.rwalld (typically port 32777/UDP). Note that
   this will not mitigate all vectors of attack.

Appendix A. - Vendor Information

   This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this
   advisory.  As  vendors  report new information to the CERT/CC, we will
   update this section and note the changes in our revision history. If a
   particular  vendor is not listed below, please check the Vulnerability
   Note (VU#638099) or contact your vendor directly.

   Hewlett-Packard

     HP is not vulnerable.

   IBM

     IBM's  AIX  operating  system,  versions  4.3.x  and  5.1L,  is not
     susceptible to the vulnerability described.

   NetBSD

     NetBSD has never been vulnerable to this problem.

   Sun Microsystems

     Sun  confirms  that  there  is  a  format  string  vulnerability in
     rpc.rwalld(1M)  which affects Solaris 2.5.1, 2.6, 7 and 8. However,
     this  issue  relies  on  a  combination  of  events,  including the
     exhaustion of system resources, which are difficult to control by a
     remote  user  in order to be exploited. Disabling rpc.rwalld(1M) in
     inetd.conf(4)  is  the  recommended  workaround  until  patches are
     available.

     Sun  is  currently  generating  patches  for this issue and will be
     releasing  a  Sun Security Bulletin once the patches are available.
     The bulletin will be available from:

     http://sunsolve.sun.com/security

     Sun patches are available from:

     http://sunsolve.sun.com/securitypatch
