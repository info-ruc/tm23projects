CERT Advisory CA-2002-14 Buffer overflow in Macromedia JRun

   Original release date: May 29, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

     * Windows  NT4  or  Windows  2000  running  IIS  versions 4 or 5 and
       Macromedia JRun 3.0 or 3.1

Overview

   A remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in Macromedia's JRun 3.0
   and 3.1.

I. Description

   JRun  is  an  application  server  that  works  with  most popular web
   servers,  such  as  Apache  and  Internet  Information  Server  (IIS).
   According to Macromedia, JRun is deployed at over 10,000 organizations
   worldwide.

   As   reported  in  the  Next  Generation  Security  Software  Advisory
   (#NISR29052002),  a remotely exploitable buffer overflow exists in the
   ISAPI  filter/application. Specifically, the buffer overflow exists in
   the portion of code that handles the host header field. If an attacker
   sends  a  specially  crafted request to the application server, he can
   overwrite a return address on the stack. Because the vulnerable DLL is
   running in the address space of the web server process, code submitted
   by the attacker will be run with SYSTEM privileges.

II. Impact

   A  remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable target
   with SYSTEM privileges.

III. Solution

   Apply a patch from Macromedia or upgrade to JRun 4. The patch is
   available from:

http://www.macromedia.com/v1/Handlers/index.cfm?ID=22273&Method=Full#download

   JRun 4 is available at:
