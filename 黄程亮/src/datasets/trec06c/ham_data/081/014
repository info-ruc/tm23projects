Aha!  I tried this on my test sheet.  Of course, not having the
scalable fonts leads to some stuttering in the dvips step, but the
output of above looks indeed MUCH better than with plain hvmath.

Yet, even making allowances, I still believe Helvetica is a tad too
heavy.  Furthermore, \sum and \prod are outrageously heavy, so that
I'd like to resort to package exscale.

I sure do!  But I doubt my boss does when he hears the price :-)

Yes, that's what I meant - I apologise.

Thank you for the advice, and of course your marvellous work on
PSNFSS in the first place.
