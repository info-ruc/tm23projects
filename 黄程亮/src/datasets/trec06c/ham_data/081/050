CERT Advisory CA-2002-13 Buffer Overflow in Microsoft's MSN Chat ActiveX 
                         Control

   Original release date: May 10, 2002
   Last revised: --
   Source: CERT/CC

   A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file.

Systems Affected

   Microsoft Windows systems with one or more of the following:
     * Microsoft MSN Chat control
     * Microsoft MSN Messenger 4.6 and prior
     * Microsoft Exchange Instant Messenger 4.6 and prior

Overview

   Microsoft's MSN Chat is an ActiveX control for Microsoft Messenger, an
   instant  messenging  client.  A  buffer overflow exists in the ActiveX
   control that may permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on
   the system with the privileges of the current user.

I. Description

   A  buffer  overflow  exists  in the "ResDLL" parameter of the MSN Chat
   ActiveX control that may permit a remote attacker to execute arbitrary
   code  on  the  system  with  the  privileges of the current user. This
   vulnerability  affects  MSN  Messenger  and Exchange Instant Messenger
   users.  Since the control is signed by Microsoft, users of Microsoft's
   Internet Explorer (IE) who accept and install Microsoft-signed ActiveX
   controls  are  also  affected.  The Microsoft MSN Chat control is also
   available for direct download from the web.

   The  <object>  tag could be used to embed the ActiveX control in a web
   page. If an attacker can trick the user into visiting a malicious site
   or the attacker sends the victim a web page as an HTML-formatted email
   or  newsgroup posting then this vulnerability could be exploited. This
   acceptance  and  installation  of  the control can occur automatically
   within  IE for users who trust Microsoft-signed ActiveX controls. When
   the  web  page  is rendered, either by opening the page or viewing the
   page  through  a  preview  pane, the ActiveX control could be invoked.
   Likewise,  if  the  ActiveX  control is embedded in a Microsoft Office
   (Word,  Excel, etc.) document, it may be executed when the document is
   opened.

   According to the Microsoft Advisory (MS02-022):

     It's  important to note that this control is used for chat rooms on
     several  MSN  sites  in  addition to the main MSN Chat site. If you
     have  successfully  used  chat on any MSN-site, you have downloaded
     and installed the chat control.

   The  CERT/CC  has  published  information on ActiveX in Results of the
   Security in ActiveX Workshop (pdf) and CA-2000-07.

   This issue is also being referenced as CAN-2002-0155:

     http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0155

II. Impact

   A  remote  attacker  may  be  able  to execute arbitrary code with the
   privileges of the current user.

III. Solution

   Apply a patch from your vendor

   Microsoft has released a patch, a fixed MSN Chat control, and upgrades
   to  address this issue. It is important that all users apply the patch
   since  it  will  prevent the installation of the vulnerable control on
   systems that have not already installed it.

     Download location for the patch:

     http://www.microsoft.com/Downloads/Release.asp?ReleaseID=38790

     Download  location  for  updated  version of MSN Messenger with the
     corrected control:

     http://messenger.msn.com/download/download.asp?client=1&update=1

     Download location for updated version of Exchange Instant Messenger
     with the corrected control:

     http://www.microsoft.com/Exchange/downloads/2000/IMclient.asp

   Microsoft  also  suggests  that the following Microsoft mail products:
   Outlook  98  and  Outlook 2000 with the Outlook Email Security Update,
   Outlook  2002, and Outlook Express will block the exploitation of this
   vulnerability via email because these products will open HTML email in
   the Restricted Sites zone.

   Other  mitigation  strategies  include  opening  web  pages  and email
   messages  in  the  Restricted  Sites zone and using email clients that
   permit users to view messages in plain-text. Likewise, it is important
   for  users  to  realize  that  a signed control only authenticates the
   origin  of  the control and does not imply any information with regard
   to  the security of the control. Therefore, downloading and installing
   signed controls through an automated process is not a secure choice.
