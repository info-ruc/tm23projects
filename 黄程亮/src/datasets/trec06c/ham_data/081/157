Have any of you linux buffs resized an ext3 partition?  Partition Magic 7.0 
doesn't support ext3 (which is the new FS for Redhat >7.2 I suppose) and it 
costs ~$50... Acronis OS Selector 5.0 (which has a slightly misleading name as 
it also does tons of stuff besides what the name implies... 
http://www.acronis.com/products/oss50/list.html ) seems to be able to do the 
trick but is also in the $40-100 range.  Has anyone used 'parted' ( 
http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/parted.html ) to do this kind of thing?

Thanks,
Joe
