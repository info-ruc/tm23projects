The third contender, which is of slightly different nature, but still
presentation-oriented,
would be the ifmath,

Slightly large x-height (which is normal for Helvetica) does not lead to a
crowded page by itself; after all, if needed, one can adjust the line
spacing a bit. Take a look at real samples, at 
        http://www.micropress-inc.com/fonts
or, a particular sample,

Yes, it is more of a text rather than the presentation font set.
