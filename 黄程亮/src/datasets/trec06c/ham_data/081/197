The table is just a table. What does it actually represent?

Importantly, it is a table built into their Type 1 font consumers
(primarily ATM --- and correspondingly in Windows Type 1 font support).
And *that* is what one really would like to have updated.
Someone else making another table on paper or in electronic
form has essentially no useful effect.

The significance of the table is that it is built into Type 1 font consumers,
so that 16-bit character strings can be used to unambiguously
access the glyphs desired.

Without that it is just a table of pedagogical interest.

In the past, Adobe and others have had no trouble ignoring the TeX world,
since it does not represent an economically significant group
(for a start it is full of people who prefer free software).
When a useful change happened it was often because some
farsighted person at Adobe, perhaps  in contact with outsiders,
did the right thing because they felt like it --- and no manager
happened to notice that they were doing it.

It would be wonderful if Adobe and Microsoft and Apple heard
your plea and will do this, despite the lack of commercial incentive.

But why worry about it in any case?  TeX works with 8-bit bytes.

Some commercial TeX implementations work internally with
Unicode, but have to separate treatment of "text" and "non-text"
fonts in any case. And glyphs in non-text fonts
are accessed by character code known to TeX by macros.
Which will always be the case, since no version of Unicode
will ever have a complete coverage of all possible glyphs.

In addition, the religion of Unicode makes it be a *character*
encoding, not *glyph* encoding, so that, e.g., variants of letter
shapes cannot be accommodated .  So you will never get
away for the need for something more than Unicode.

Glad to hear it. Great.

But wait, USA congress has passed many laws changing to metric system,
starting shortly after the French revolution!  Unfortunately it seems not to
have had any effect (except in a few rare instances: wine is sold in
750 ml bottles --- some companies, like Caterpillar, are completely
"metricated" etc.).

And what about stupid notation for dates?  These are widespread.
The logical notation is of course year/month/day.
How many countries make that the norm?

I wasted much time in the 1980s writing letters to magazines like
"Science News" asking them to use SI in their reporting.
It made no difference, and the convenient conversion of
units in calculators and computers made the change even
less likely.  Of course as a result we lost a couple missions
to Mars that cost hundreds of millions of dollars...

But then I still see inappropriate units like centimeter, Angstrom etc.
used widely in Europe even though they were deprecated 50 years
ago when most of the world switch to SI.

But in any case what has this to do with TeX or Unicode :-)
