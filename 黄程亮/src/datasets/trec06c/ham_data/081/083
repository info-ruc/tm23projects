That header does not appear on the legitimate output from tex-fonts that
*I* get.  The headers I see from tex-fonts are substantially the same
whether it's annoying virus-laden spam or legitimate messages like yours.

For example, the virus spam tex-fonts sent me today (along with another two
items of spam) had headers like this:

Granted that such viruses never clobber me (Virex helps, but the fact that
they're all Windoze executables and I've got a Mac is rather more
significant); it's still a touch irritating to someone like me on a dial up
connection who's taken the trouble to keep his email address away from the
spammers.
