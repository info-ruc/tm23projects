I mean for signifigently more that just surface to orbit manuveres. I mean
entire package. Launch (however unlikely that a  whole starship would be
launched from the surface), orbital insertion, adjustments in orbital height
(from low, to geostationary, etc, or even insertion at Le Grange points),
orbits worked out on-the-fly by gravitational well measurements.   Possibly
also facility for aerobraking and other rare (hopefully) ship manuvres. I'm
thinking beyond Sol-system operations to the potential for having to come up
with safe routes in new terratories (after all, the first starships will be
probes and exploration craft, yes?).
I brought up holographics, because as I see it the best way to represent
manuveres in 3 dimentions is with a 3dimentional display system.
True, a screen can display can display a 2D interpretation of a 3D
environment, but I can't see it ever providing as much information as a 3D
display.

I agree that most of the computing power on the ship, will probably consist
of nothing more than "smart" system relays. If you want videos or music,
etc, played on your own computer (I mean, we do have to think of the
psychological wellbeing too, of the crew), you plug it into the ship
network, dumb in itself, and transfer what you want (low priority data) from
someone else on the network, or a central data-storage.  Whereas changes to
essential systems would be reported to whatever terminals were at the time
logged in as engineering/environmental/etc, (mid to high priority data).
Things like signels to manuvering thrusters or engines, would be
high-priority data, getting transfered first through the network, or
possibly having their own seperate control lines.
Thought: Would there be a backup control room or alow the ship to be
controlled from anywhere on board, with correct accesss?  The later would
seem more prudent, as it alows more redundency in the system, without any
extra physical parts.
