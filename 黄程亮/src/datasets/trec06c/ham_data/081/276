        RE:TRANSFER OF THE SUM OF US$30.5M DOLLARS INTO YOUR ACCOUNT 

        FIRST,I MUST SOLICIT YOUR CONFIDENCE IN THIS TRANSACTION.THIS IS BY VIRTUE OF IT'S NATURE AS BEING UTTERLY CONFIDENTIAL AND TOP SECRET.THOUGH I KNOW THAT A TRANSACTION OF THIS MAGNITUDE WILL MAKE ANYONE APPREHENSIVE AND WORRIED.BUT IAM ASSURING YOU THAT ALL WILL BE WELL AT THE END OF 
        THE DAY.WE HAVE DECIDED TO CONTACT YOU THROUGH THIS MEDIUM DUE TO THE URGENCY OF THIS TRANSACTION AS WE HAVE BEEN RELIABLY INFORMED OF YOUR 
        DISCRETENESS AND ABILITY. 

        LET ME START BY INTRODUCING MYSELF TO YOU. IAM MR. LARRY WILSON, 
        A CHIEF ACCOUNTANT WITH THE ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK OF NIGERIA . 
        MARINA BRANCH OFFICE LAGOS. 
        I CAME TO KNOW ABOUT YOU IN MY PRIVATE SEARCH FOR A RELIABLE AND 
        REPUTABLE 
        PERSON TO HANDLE THIS CONFIDENTIAL TRANSACTION AS WE ARE STILL IN 
        ACTIVE 
        SERVICE. 

        THE PROPOSITION. 

        AN AUSTRALIAN NATIONAL,LATE ENGINEER BUTCH R. MIGUEL,AN OIL 
        MERCHANT/CONTRACTOR 
        WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF NIGERIA,UNTIL HIS DEATH THREE YEARS AGO 
        IN A GHASTLY AIR CRASH IN AN EGYPT AIR, FLIGHT 990 WHICH OCCURED ON 2ND 
        NOVEMBER 1999,UNTIL HIS DEATH,BANKED WITH US HERE AT 
        ZENITH INTERNATIONAL BANK LIMITED, VICTORIA ISLAND LAGOS,AND 
        HAD A CLOSSING BALANCE OF US$30.5M(THIRTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND 
        UNITED STATES DOLLARS)IN A FIXED DEPOSIT ACCOUNT,WHICH THE BANK 
        UNQUESTIONABLY 
        EXPECTS IT TO BE CLAIMED BY ANY AVAILABLE FOREIGN NEXT-OF-KIN TO THE 
        LATE BENEFICIARY OR ALTERNATIVELY BE DONATED TO A DISCREDITED TRUST 
        FUND 
        FOR THE PURCHASE OF ARMS AND AMMUNITIONS AT THE MILITARY WAR COLLEGE 
        IN KADUNA STATE HERE IN NORTHERN NIGERIA. 


        SEQUEL TO THIS,FERVENT VALUABLE EFFORTS WERE MADE BY ZENITH 
        INTERNATIONAL 
        BANK .TO GET IN TOUCH WITH ANY OF THE MIGUEL'S FAMILY OR RELATIVES BUT 
        PROVED TO NO AVAIL.IT IS BECAUSE OF THE PERCEIVED POSIBILITY OF NOT 
        BEING 
        ABLE TO LOCATE ANY OF THE LATE ENGR.BUTCH R. MIGUEL'S NEXT-OF-KIN(HE 
        HAD NO KNOWN WIFE AND CHILDREN) THAT THE MANAGEMENT UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
        OF OUR HONOURABLE CHAIRMAN / CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER- MR JIM OVIA, 
        THAT AN ARRANGEMENT BE MADE FOR THE FUND TO BE DECLARED"UN-CLAIMABLE" 
        AND SUBSIQUENTLY BE DONATED TO THE TRUST FUND FOR THE PURCHASE OF ARMS 
        AND AMMUNITON TO FURTHER ENHANCE THE COURSE OF WAR IN AFRICA AND THE 
        WORLD IN GENERAL.

        COLLEAGUES AND I NOW SEEK YOUR PERMISSION TO HAVE YOU STAND AS THE 
        NEXT-OF-KIN

        NOTE THAT THIS TRANSACTION WILL STRICTLY BE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING 
        TERMS 
        AND CONDITIONS AS I HAVE STATED BELOW, AS WE HAVE HEARD CONFIRMED CASES 
        OF BUSINESS ASSOCIATES RUNNING AWAY WITH FUNDS KEPT IN THEIR CUSTODY 
        WHEN IT IS FINALLY REMITTED INTO THIER BANK ACCOUNTS.A VERY GOOD 
        EXAMPLE 
        IS THE ONE OF MR. PETER HOPWOOD,THE PRESIDENT OF MILEAGE TRADING AND 
        INVESTMENT COMPANY AT NUMBER 121, WEST 55TH STREET,21st FLOOR,NEW YORK 
        10022, AND THE FORMER CHAIRMAN OF OMPADEC(MR PATRICK OPIA)WHOM WE WERE 
        RELIABLY INFORMED THAT AFTER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN BOTH PARTNERS IN 
        WHICH 
        HE WAS TO TAKE 15% OF THE MONEY WHILE THE REMAINING 85% FOR THE 
        NIGERIAN 
        OFFICIALS. WITH ALL THE REMAINING DOCUMENTS SIGNED,THE MONEY WAS DULY 
        TRANSFERED INTO MR HOPWOOD'S ACCOUNT, ONLY TO BE DISAPPOINTED ON THEIR 
        ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK AND WERE INFORMED THAT MR PETER HOPWOOD WAS NO 
        LONGER 
        ON THAT ADDRESS,WHILE HIS TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS HAD BEEN 
        RE-ALLOCATED 
        TO SOME BODY ELSE. 

        tHIS WAS HOW THEY LOST US$18.5M TO MR HOPWOOD.THIS IS A VERY RECENT 
        STORY 
        HERE IN MY COUNTRY AND EVERYBODY IS AWARE OF THIS.SOME OF THE OFFICIALS 
        DECIDED TO CRY OUT AND FACE THE LAW,BECAUSE THEY FELT THEY HAD LOST SO 
        MUCH TO A STRANGER,WHILE THE CHAIRMAN OF OMPADEC(MR PATRICK OPIA)IS NOW 
        HIDDING IN A FORIEGN COUNTRY.SO RIGHT NOW, IAM TAKING ALL PRECAUTIONARY 
        MEASURES TO GUARD AGAINST RE-OCCURENCE OF SUCH ACT IN OUR CASE.THIAS
