Dear Mr. Zinn,

As far as pictures go, I would have no information. I can't tell you how
excited I am to see someone of this family. If that is Dorcas, she's a
pretty lady. I have a ton of documented information. I have many of the
original documents. However, some of it will disagree with what is on your
website. Please remember that I started with none of this and built it up
through documentation. As far as the Wilkerson's go, I have only a little
and I am not sure of much. The Searcy's and Dooley's I'm pretty confident
that what I have at this point is right - or as much as it can be. I have a
female Wilkerson ancestor which I am trying to just now develop (married a
Searcy)...Anyway here is Polly's line first. I have much, much more on the
Searcys and the Dooleys. I will send the Dooleys next. Hope you find this
interesting.

Lucy as a Williams.

Per summary reported by
Evelyn W. Wallace:
It is reported by Alvahn Holmes in SOME FARRAR'S ISLAND DESCENDANTS that
Lucy Williams (qv), sister of John Williams Esq. and of William Williams,
was married to Bartlett Searcy (qv) who died in or near Madison Co., KY
while continuing to hold property in Granville Co. The relationship of the
two Searcy males is not known as of 9/97. However, examination of grantor
deed indexes of Madison Co. indicates that early in the history of that
county, Reuben had several land transactions, the nature of which is
unknown.

Examination of a recently published book by Jackie Couture, MADISON
COUNTY, KENTUCKY, COURT ORDER BOOK A, 1787-1791 [Bowie, MD: Heritage Books,
1996] indicates that Reuben Searcy was physically present in that county
during this time period. Also present were these Searcys: Asa, Bennett,
Charles, and Lucy, the latter the widow of Bartlett Searcy, being the former
Lucy Williams of Granville Co.

The will of aforesaid Bartlett Searcy was probated in Madison Co. 1795;
Reuben, who had also witnessed the will, was named as one of the executors,
others being Lucy Searcy (nee Williams, widow of Bartlett) and Samuel Searcy
(son of Bartlett).

From:Donald Wilkerson <dwilkerson@mexicomo.net>
Presley Wilkerson who married Polly Searcy is a brother to my William
Wilkerson, they are sons of William Wilkerson, Sr. and Betty/Betsy
Stribling. I am presently working on Stribling family for Betsy's ancestors.
I can send FGS's on children of Presley and Polly Searcy Wilkerson if you
want them. I saw one Searcy married a Hardwick, I wonder if he is related to
Margaret Hardwick who married Thomas H. Wilkerson, they went to Oregon.
Sarah A. Searcy Dooley's letter of 22 Jan 1895 states they had 8 or 9
children - I have accounted for 5
