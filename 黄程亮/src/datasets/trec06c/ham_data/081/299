Hi Ryuta,

Sorry you couldn't make it! Attached are the minutes of the meeting.

cheerily,

Peter

Subject: Mo Meeting Minutes (07/01/02)

...and other alliterative topics in nuclear physics!

1. Mo Chemistry (Doug):
	George finished compiling information on Mo compounds, and
listing them by formal valence.  Most of it was not news, but there were a
few new prospects.  There was some discussion of possible replacements for
Mo(CO)6 as the Mo compound we will focus on dissolving.
	Next there was some more talk of the plan Doug will follow with
regard to testing new Mo solutions.  This will probably involve fairly
extensive use of flame AA to determine Mo concentration by weight.
	1. Optimize instrument parameters (including flame
	   characteristics, and exact dilution in MIBK) using a standard
	   solution (like 0.3% Mo by mass).
	2. Fine tune instrument setup and calibrate instrument for
	   linearity and range.
	3. Mix saturated solutions in PC an other scintillators (Xylenes,
	   Benzene, Toluene, 1-Methyl Napthelene).  Creation of standard
	   solutions may be necessary for the other solvents as well.

Action Items:
	Doug will write and distribute a more complete version of the
above plan.
	George will email his list of Mo compounds to Peter and anyone else
who wants a copy.

2. APDs (George and Hideiko)
	George has been trying to nail down some of the specific
characteristics of APDs made by different companies (mostly Hamamatsu),
and find a way to come up with the spatial resolution of these APDs.
Most have timing resolutions between 1 and 10 ns.  10 ns corresponds to
roughly 1 m  in spatial resolution, and 1 ns corresponds to about 10 cm.
He has also been trying to work out the fraction of dead space in the
detector due to the separation between the APDs.  There is some concern
that any APDs we get will need to be cooled (maybe to LN2 temperatures!)
for the dark current to be low enough.  Hideiko has been looking at coming
up with statistical limits on the spatial resolution analytically.

Action Items:
	Hamish, George and Hideiko will form an APD "working group" that
will focus on actually getting some APDs from different companies and
trying single photon counting with them.  The group will also work on
characterizing the dark current from these APDs.

3. Energy resolution (Vic):
	Vic has reading up on the proper functional form and relative
normalizations for the 2v and 0v 2beta decay modes, and gathering the
requisite computational tools for the upcoming analysis.

Action Items:
	Steve Elliot has apparently done calculations similar to this
before, Vic will email him for guidance.
	Hamish has some of Steve's old presentation slides, and will email
them to Vic.

4. Discussion of 2 beta review paper:
	Ran out of time.
