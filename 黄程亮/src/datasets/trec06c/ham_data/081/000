Steven - 

Thanks for your note. You are correct.  Mayor Kelly is considering
opening Ayd Mill Road for 4-lane traffic for one year on a test basis. 
While the last time I chatted with him - later last week - he had not
yet made a decision, he does not need City Council approval to proceed. 

I agree with your concerns on this issue, Steven.  Two years ago, the
City Council voted to connect the road as a two lane road with numerous
amenities from which the neighborhood could benefit.  This would have
handled the existing traffic and taken traffic off of virtually every
neighborhood street.  A four lane roadway - with the speeds the Mayor is
suggesting - could in my opinion attract new traffic.  I am very
concerned about this and have repeatedly made this assertion to the
Mayor.

Right now, Steven, I am still actively working to urge the Mayor to
re-think this issue and consider the option the City Council voted for
after years and years of neighborhood and staff study.  As this moves
forward, let's stay in touch.  

Thanks again, and please call or e-mail any time on any issue. 

Pat Harris

Dear Pat Harris,

I heard that Kelly soon open the Ayd Mill to freeway traffic
with four lanes. It will be a Highway 280 in the neighborhood.

Is this true?

I am VERY OPPOSED to this action. It seems very high-handed.
