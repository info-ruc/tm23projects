Dear Sir ,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction; this is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL and TOP SECRET. Though
I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive
and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of
the day, we have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this
transaction.

Let me start first by introducing myself properly to you, I am Mr. TONY
OKASIME, THE FINANCIAL DIRECTOR with the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos.
I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable
person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer
of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence.

THE PROPOSITION

A foreigner, with name, Late Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil
Merchant/Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his
death Six years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at Union
Bank Plc. Nigeria, Lagos, and had a closing balance of US$9.5M (Nine
Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only) which the bank
now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any available foreign
next-of-kin of the Late beneficiary. Fervent valuable efforts are been
made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek's family or
relatives  proved to no avail.

It is because of these perceived possibility of not been able to locate
any of Late Engr. Johnson Creek's next-of-kin or relatives (he had no
wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman
and member of the board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu,
ORDERED that the fund should be declared "UNCLAIMABLE" if there is no
member of late Engr.Johnson Creek's Relatives that comes to claim the money.

So my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand
as a next-of-kin or relative to Late Engr. Johnson Creek so that the
funds will be released and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary
next-of-kin, all documents and proves to enable you get this fund US$9.5m
will be carefully worked out and more so we are assuring you of a 100%
risk free involvement as your involvement will not expose you to any risks
now or after the successful completion of the transaction. Your share
stays while the rest would be for me and my colleagues for investment
purposes in your country.

We have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, after it has been
transferred into your account. 20% of the money will go to you for acting
as the beneficiary of the funds, 5% will be set aside for reimbursement to
both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the
course of this transaction and 75% to us the originators of the transaction.

If this proposal is OK by you and you do not wish to take undue advantage
of the trust, we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get
back to me immediately via my private Email: akindavidse@yahoo.com or Fax
No: 234-1-7599387 for security reason, Furnish me with your most
confidential Telephone number, Fax number and exclusive bank particulars
so that we can use these information to apply for the release and
subsequent transfer of the funds in your favor.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
