Hello fellow TeXnicians,

I am looking for a MATH font set suitable for electronic presentations.

The general wisdom for such presentations is to use sans serif to
improve readability.  Thus, FoilTeX and also SliTeX settle for sans
fonts by default; however, math fonts remain the CM seriffed fonts.

There are apparently only two contenders for sans serif math fonts,
both offered commercially by micropress, and both of which I find not
quite suiteable for the particular purpose:

    o hvmath:  In my opinion, this is too heavy, and has too large
	an x-height, leading to a crowded looking page.

	Micropress provides 300dpi pk-fonts suitable for print preview,
	which is what I used for a test.

    o cmbright:  As the name implies, this is rather light and thus,
	not quite unsuitable for projection.  However, I find the
	font genuinely appealing in regular text.

	The MF sources and support files, except the scalable Type1
	fonts are part of PSNFSS.

I compared the same talk of mine with both the FoilTeX default, and
the two packages above -- both of which work flawless with just
\usepackage.  The FoilTeX text fonts are in-between those two in
weight, and I believe this is just the right one.  Now, the math
mismatch would be less an issue if only displayed equations would be
seriffed, but it becomes a very apparent one when sub/super-scripts
are needed (e.g. chemical formulae).

There is quite a bunch of presentation packages now available in
LaTeX (slides, foils, seminar, prosper, pdfslide, pdfscreen,
[ppower4]), yet most focus on questions like layout tricks and adding
navigation, leaving most font issues open.  I for one adopted
pdflatex, the foils style, and supplemental packages to aid layout,
e.g. geometry, ragged2e, textpos, and paralist.

I lack experience in MetaFont and company, which is why I shied away
from fiddling with them so far.  FoilTeX's fltfonts.def is not for the
light-hearted to dive in.

Can anyone in this list help?  Is there a radically different approach?
