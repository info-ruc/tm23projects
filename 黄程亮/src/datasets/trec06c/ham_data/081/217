Alright, let's see if any of you have any bright ideas about this one:

In the process of using Acronis Disk Administrator to resize my ext3
partition I mistakenly installed their dorky bootloader (Acronis OS
Selector) over GRUB on the mbr of my hard drive.

You would think that wouldn't be a problem and that I could do a
'grub-install hda' to re-write GRUB stage1 to the mbr.  I did this and for
some unexplainable reason I also did 'grub-install hda1'.

Now hda1 is my Windows 98 SE partition! This means the small bit of code
that is GRUB stage1 was written to my Windows partition.  Now, when I boot
up, I get the GRUB bootloader menu and can boot into Linux fine (thank you
God) but when I choose to boot to Windows it simply executes the GRUB
stage1 code (which outputs to the screen 'GRUB loading stage2...') and
hangs.

I've tried booting with a win98se bootdisk and doing a 'sys c:' and even
'fdisk /mbr' followed by a 'sys c:' but everytime the sys command returns
'invalid media type reading drive c, abort, retry, fail?'

I can still mount the dos partition so I can backup any data or files and
reformat that partition as a last resort (then I'd have to decide whether
to shun MS forevert or to reinstall windoze).  I'd prefer to just fix the
damage that the 'grub-install hda1' did... but I've reached the limit of
my expertise (and maybe the expertise/interest of the bug-grub mailing
list).

Any thoughts would be appreciated,
Joe
