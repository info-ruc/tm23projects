Thanks for pointing this out.  But I'd like to stay kinda formal :-)

Indeed - as Walter advised.

    % test file indicating font issues in FoilTeX
    \documentclass{foils}

    % we want vectors in math italic bold
    \usepackage{bm}
    \renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\bm{#1}}

    \begin{document}
    \foilhead{Subscripts are seriffed: H\boldmath$_2$O\\
	    -- as is {\slshape Slanted Bold}}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Newton's law for particle $i$:
	\[
	\vec{F}_i = \dot{\vec{p}}_i
	\]
    \item Text is sans serif, but math remains CM.
    \end{itemize}
    \end{document}


I am looking mainly for a math font set that matches sans serif
text.  The other issue, namely, bold \slshape appearing seriffed is
not nearly as serious, but would be nice if fixed.
