For an exploration ship on a multi-year mission an actual "Control Room" is
probably not terribly necessary. Most day-to-day operations of the ship
would perforce be automated to a great extent, not requiring constant
oversight. In fact, once safely on course, there would be almost nothing to
do at all. Even for Kelly's Explorer class of starship I can't see needing a
control room any bigger than what is currently on the Space Shuttle. With
wall sized flat screens in everyone's quarters, wireless PDAs and voice
controlled interaction with the C3 systems, control oversight could be
exercised from just about anywhere.

Once the exploration vessel was in-system, there would be a much greater
amount of daily decision making going on so there might be some social
usefulness to having a centrally designated Control Room, but this could be
configured shortly before the exploration vessel arrives from an empty
storage room that used to house food for the journey. The control runs for
the equipment would of course have been preinstalled in several storage
rooms for that eventuality. Probably also want a control room for the
exploration itself, not just control of the ship and its landing craft.

As for redundancy, I would think that the computer network would be a
distributed model with multiple redundant main processors located throughout
the ship. It would even be able to draw on the power of individual PDAs if
needed. Since the charter of this group is to explore technology feasible
within the next fifty years, you should be willing to speculate a little
about changes to computing technology within that timeframe. For instance,
the "PDA" may well be physically inside your head and wired to your nervous
system through your eyes, ears and spinal cord. This is important because
then the holographic display wouldn't really be necessary, it would be 3-D
inside your head!

USAF Teams With Industry To Develop Laser Guns For Jet Fighters

Kirtland AFB - June 5, 2002

Exploring the feasibility of using high-energy lasers on fighter aircraft is
the aim of an agreement signed Friday (May 31) between the Air Force
Research Laboratory here and Lockheed Martin of Fort Worth, Texas.

Under a Cooperative Research And Development Agreement, or CRADA, the
laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate and Lockheed Martin's Aeronautics
Company will pool their resources.

The Air Force laboratory will contribute its expertise in high-energy
lasers, laser beam-control technology and laser vulnerability data. Lockheed
Martin will use the Air Force's information and examine the integration and
optimum performance of high-energy lasers and beam-control technology on
various fighter aircraft such as the F-15, F-16, F-22 and F-35 Joint Strike
Fighter.

The company will also assess the military value and potential of lasers on
tactical platforms and evaluate related aero-optic issues.

Both organizations are expected to benefit from the cooperative effort and
information transfer. The directorate will get insight into the Joint Strike
Fighter and other Lockheed Martin platforms to better determine how to apply
future research to operational systems that benefit the warfighter.

Lockheed Martin will get better technical information on high-energy lasers
and beam control systems that will help the company design better weapons
systems for its aircraft. The overall cooperative effort is expected to
advance and further the development of high-energy lasers aboard tactical
aircraft.

The laboratory's Directed Energy Directorate is building on past
accomplishments. Its scientists invented the chemical laser that is being
used on the Airborne Laser, a Boeing 747-400 series jumbo jet aircraft,
under development, that will use a laser to destroy ballistic missiles
shortly after being launched while still in powered flight.

The directorate is also providing technical support to the Airborne Laser
program. In the early 1980s, the directorate demonstrated that a modified
Boeing 707 laser-armed aircraft could destroy targets in the air.

 intersting, but will it really work? I thought I'd heard something about lasers (though good in space) being lousy as atmospheric weapons. I think it's because the beam begins to ionize the air in its path and causes diffusion. tell me if that sounds right.

Bingo!

Atmospheric ionization was one of the largest obstacles airborne lasers had
to overcome. It caused a thermal bloom which then spread the beam and
significantly reduced energy on target. This has been mostly overcome, but
at the speeds fighter aircraft typically move, they will outrun the
solution.

So why are they looking at laser weapons on a fighter airframe if they
aren't going to be significantly better than missiles or guns? Because Black
Horse is a fighter sized airframe and is designed to reach orbit...where
atmospheric interference is no longer a problem and the laser WILL
outperform missiles and guns.

It makes one heck of a quick launch antisatellite weapon and would probably
even be able to generate some significant antiballistic missile usefulness.

I doubt this is for blackhorse.  See they also know how to cancel out 
blooming from earth to oprbit, and even back when the f-15's were designed th
ey we're designed to be laser compatable.  The Navy has a significant 
research effort in it to replace their phalanx anti-antiship missle systems.

Bessides why make a black Horse compatable laser, when you never funded Black 
Horse?

Bingo!

Atmospheric ionization was one of the largest obstacles airborne lasers had
to overcome. It caused a thermal bloom which then spread the beam and
significantly reduced energy on target. This has been mostly overcome, but
at the speeds fighter aircraft typically move, they will outrun the
solution.

So why are they looking at laser weapons on a fighter airframe if they
aren't going to be significantly better than missiles or guns? Because Black
Horse is a fighter sized airframe and is designed to reach orbit...where
atmospheric interference is no longer a problem and the laser WILL
outperform missiles and guns.

It makes one heck of a quick launch antisatellite weapon and would probably
even be able to generate some significant antiballistic missile usefulness.

intersting, but will it really work? I thought I'd heard something about
lasers (though good in space) being lousy as atmospheric weapons. I think
it's because the beam begins to ionize the air in its path and causes
diffusion. tell me if that sounds right.

Ummm, there are many things that I know about that most people don't. As you
might suspect, I'm not at liberty to talk about them. Black Horse isn't one
of them. Black Horse as far as I and the rest of the world know, does not
exist. But as I am sure you are aware, that is not the same thing as not
existing.

By inference, there were several operational systems designed to give the
USAF a limited orbital strike capability until a fully operational system
came along. Those systems are no longer around so I must assume they were
replaced with something.

Well they were the last time I checked....

Actually, I think the prohibition only applies to _nuclear_ weapons. Which
an orbital laser equipped fighter makes useless unless launched in massive
quantities. Russia and China would both be able to swamp such a fighter.
India and Pakistan on the other hand would be much more easily handled.

Black Horse was tasked to be able to deliver its "cargo" to a particular
point in orbit within four hours. So it would be possible with some warning
of imminent launch to have such a fighter nearby in orbit. The problem is
that it is a low orbit and hence its "loiter time" would be very brief. It
would require several spacecraft to maintain continuous coverage.

Lots of possibilities here.

Just a thought that I suddenly realized I had missed.

The ABM Treaty only prohibits more than two Anti Ballistic Missile sites in
the United States. It does NOT address orbital anti ballistic missile
weapons that are not satellites.

Just a thought that I suddenly realized I had missed.

The ABM Treaty only prohibits more than two Anti Ballistic Missile sites in
the United States. It does NOT address orbital anti ballistic missile
weapons that are not satellites.

Well, I must correct myself (since no one except Kelly called me on it). I
was thinking that "that which is not explicitly forbidden must be allowed".
Unfortunately, my memory of the ABM Treaty dates from when it was signed. I
just went back to look at it and it turns out that they DID explicitly
forbid everything except the two ground based sites. Here is a brief
synopsis:

IV. THE ABM TREATY
AND BALLISTIC MISSILE DEFENSE
Background
The ABM Treaty was a product of the Cold War, bipolarity, and the state of
technology at that time. The United States and Soviet Union had both
deployed significant strategic nuclear forces that increasingly came to rely
on long-range ballistic missiles. In an attempt to forestall a further
Soviet increase in the number of such systems, the United States sought and
obtained from the Soviet Union in 1972 an interim agreement for the
limitation of "strategic offensive arms" (Interim Agreement), which
essentially froze the number of strategic ballistic missile launchers of the
two sides at existing levels. At the same time, the two parties entered into
a formal treaty (the ABM Treaty) on the limitation of "antiballistic missile
systems," or systems designed to defend against strategic ballistic
missiles.
The ABM Treaty did not ban all antiballistic missile systems. It permitted
the research, development, and limited deployment of ground-based ABM
systems. As signed in 1972, the two sides were permitted two operational ABM
sites, each with 100 ABM launchers and 100 ABM interceptor missiles, with
associated radar, storage, and test facilities. A 1974 amendment reduced the
number of permitted operational ABM sites to one per side. The deployments
were limited to ground-based ABM systems, which were the technological
approach of the time and included fixed ground-based launchers,
ground-launched interceptor missiles, and associated ground-based radars.
Deployment of ABM systems based on "other physical principles" and including
constituent parts capable of substituting for these ground-based ABM
components was to be subject to discussion and agreement by the parties.
Development, testing, or deployment of sea-, air-, or space-based, or mobile
land-based systems were all banned.
[37]
The ABM Treaty thus enshrined as strategic doctrine the principle of
deterrence through threat of retaliation. Since neither side was free to
deploy unlimited defenses against the strategic ballistic missiles of the
other, each nation sought to deter any outright attack by the other through
its ability to threaten overwhelming retaliation against an attack with its
own nuclear-armed strategic ballistic missiles. The Interim Agreement and
the ABM Treaty were bilateral agreements applicable only to U.S. and Soviet
strategic ballistic missiles and ABM systems. While the Soviets were worried
about U.K. and French strategic nuclear forces, and both the Soviet Union
and the United States had reason to be concerned about Chinese nuclear
forces, these forces were not limited by either agreement.
