Subject: From the list administrator: spam on the tex-fonts list
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1021985192.beebe@plot79.math.utah.edu>

Yes, we are seeing a significant increase in the incidence of spam
everywhere on the net, not just on the tex-fonts list.  One flavor
that I routinely get is the offer of, say, one million email addresses
(for a new low price) so that I too can join the spammers.  Yuck!

None of the spam that has been posted to the tex-fonts list has come
from list members.  Recently, we are seeing spam instances where the
message's From: address has been set to a legitimate one selected from
users at our site, instead of the bogus addresses typical in the past.

I've already removed 53 spam messages from today's incoming mail in my
own mailbox, and I expect to find dozens more yet, sigh...

I intend to move the tex-fonts and tex-archive lists to the control of
a mailing list program (possibly GNU mailman), configured to permit
posting only from list members.  However, because of my busy schedule,
this is going to take some time, so for now, please keep your fingers
near the delete key.

In the meantime, let's keep the tex-fonts list on subject, and drop
the spam discussion.
