Well, in this country at least sans serif math is favoured in school text
books, where hairy math rarely occurs. Otherwise people tend to 
stay away from it, particularly when they are using sans serif to
mean something (like a tensor).

As for being designed for presentation, being heavier than CM etc.,
Lucida Bright and Lucida New Math ought to be considered.
Not sans serif of course, but "robust" enough to withstand low
and medium resolution rasterization.  For discussion of the Lucida
super family see:  http://members.aol.com/willadams/lucida.txt

For amusing footnotes on font readability see very bottom of
http://www.yandy.com/lucida.htm  and
http://www.yandy.com/mathtime.htm

Another thing to note is that if you magnifiy any font enough it
will start to look heavier (which is why "optical scaling" is needed).
So one option is to typeset using small fonts, and use a large
value for \magnification.

Regards, Berthold.
