comp.text.tex is probably still the best place to discuss that.
Perhaps also tex-fonts@sunshine.math.utah.edu.  I've included both on
the CC here.

THe cm-super t1 fonts already do follow unicodegn.html, but the math
mode fonts are not included.  (Verified by looking at the FullName
fields of the afm files.)
