Helvetica is MUCH larger than CM.  As a result, many dimensions
in your document, particularly the leading (distance between the 
lines), are too small for Helvetica.  _This_ is the reason, 
why it looks bad!

In addition to hvmath.sty, there is an improved package 
hvmaths.sty on CTAN (*), which lets you scale the Helvetica 
fonts, so that they match the size of CM.  Besides, the leading 
should be increased somewhat, since Helvetica has a larger 
x-height than CM, even when scaled to the same height of the 
capital letters.  

For instance, scaling down Helevtica to about 93% of its 
natural size and increasing the distance between the lines 
to about 105% gives a good result:

  \usepackage[scaled=0.93]{hvmaths}
  \linespread{1.05}
  \normalfont

The required \linespread depends on the line width and 
should be judged visually.

Hmm... the prefabricated bitmap fonts cannot be scaled, 
of course.  But --  believe me -- it will look really good 
with scalable Type1 fonts :-)

You mean "not suitable"?
Well, it was not particularly designed for that purpose.
