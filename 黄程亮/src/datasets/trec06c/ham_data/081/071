Just for the record, if any of the (huge load) of spam I'm seeing is
coming via this list, it is NOT comming with an envelope sender of
tex-fonts-errors@sunshine.math.utah.edu like the legitimate list
output does.  (Else it would get filtered with the list's mail
rather than my spam sink or folder of last resort.)  It must
be doing an end run 'round the list-ware, as used to be an
extremely common tactic to use against majordomo lists.
