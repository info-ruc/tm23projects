Hi all,

  Here is the requirements document, along with how SilkyMail
and SquirrelMail stack up to the requirements.

We'll have the user evaluations on SilkyMail and SquirrelMail
by the meeting on Thursday.

Items 6.1 and 7.3a will need to be completed and addressed.

Thanks
  Ruben

0.0 Definitions
  * MUST - The web mail client simply cannot be supported unless this
    requirement is met.
  * SHOULD - While not absolutely mandatory, this feature is considered
    very important.
  * REQUESTED - Feature would add significant value, though it does
    not warrant either must-have or should-have functionality.

1.0 Compose New Mail
  1.1 Must be able to copy outgoing mail to a sent mail folder
      a. Squirrel: Yes
      b. Silky: Yes
  1.2 Should be able to auto-insert signature

      b. Silky: Yes
  1.3 Requested to use LDAP look up
      a. Squirrel: Plug-in available.
      b. Sillky: Cannot determine since it is not currently configured to
                 use our LDAP server -- which I can't change.
  1.4 Requested to have Address Book expansion
      a. Squirrel: Plug-in available - though it requires JavaScript. It
                   would be nice, but certainly not necessary.
      b. Silky: No

  2.1 Must show all subscribed bboards
      a. Squirrel: Yes
      b. Silky: Yes

  2.3 Should be able to check for messages in bboards, so you know how many
      (new) messages you have
      a. Squirrel: Plug-in available - Very desirable to satisfy this
         requirement; it shows message count, unread count, and space used
      b. Silky: No

      a. Squirrel: Couldn't test, time out error.
      b. Silky: Must be on higher user level. Couldn't test, time out error.

      a. Squirrel: Yes
      b. Silky: Must be on higher user level - yes.

  3.4 Should be able to create/rename/delete personal folders
      a. Squirrel: Yes
      b. Silky: Must be on higher user level - yes.
  3.5 Should check for messages in personal folders, so you know how many
      (new) messages you have
      a. Squirrel: Plug-in available - Very desirable to satisfy this
         requirement; it shows message count, unread count, and space used
      b. Silky: No

      b. Silky: No. Must click in frame first, then print that frame.
  4.5 Must be able to specify how to reply to messages (reply to one / all)
      a. Squirrel: Yes
      b. Silky: Yes
  4.6 Must be able to excerpt message on reply
      a. Squirrel: Yes
      b. Silky: Yes

5.0 Web Specific
   5.1 Must be supported on Netscape versions 4.x and 6.x
       a. Squirrel: Yes
       b. Silky: Yes
   5.2 Must be supported on Internet Explorer versions 5.0 and above
       a. Squirrel: Yes
       b. Silky: Yes

       and hide URL
       a. Squirrel: Yes, unless you change display prefs and click its
          refresh button.
       b. Silky: No. Too many options refresh pages in full browser frame.
   5.7 Requested to have other web browser support:

         (no testing done here, yet)

6.0 Administration
   6.1 Must be able to reset user preferences

                    Can we please get a detailed explanation here?
       b. Silky: If using IMSP yes
   6.2 User preferences must not overlap
       a. Squirrel: Yes, its preferences are unique to it
       b. Silky: Appears that it would share Mulberry prefs, which
          seems to indicate compounding Mulberry and SilkyMail prefs
          resets/problems.

7.0 Other
   7.1 Must show quota warnings, but specifically any server messages
       a. Squirrel: No
       b. Silky: No

   7.3 Plug-in flexibility
       a. Squirrel: Yes, specifics to be based on plug-in evaluation by

       b. Silky: No
