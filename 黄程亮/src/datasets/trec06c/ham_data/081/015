You're fighting at several front lines here:

(1) 
foils.cls defines its own math font families, because the
normal definitions of the CM font families do not provide
scaling to more than 25pt.  Unfortunately, foils.cls does
this in a somewhat strange way, which differs from the
default math font setup.  For instance, the normal
definition of \mathrm is changed without need.

(2) 
There exist no CM Sansserif math italic fonts.

(3) 
The CM Sansserif _text_ fonts have no bold slanted variant.
(The EC fonts do, but EC Sansserif is UGLY.)

(4)
You are misusing a mixture of text and math to typeset
chemical formulas.  This is evil.


With HV-Math you can get it completely right, but if you 
insist in a "poor man's solution", see the below example.

There is no math font that matches CM Sanserif.  
Period.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% snip %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass{foils}

% make numbers and operator names sans serif:
\SetSymbolFont{operators}{normal}{OT1}{fcmss}{m}{n}
\SetSymbolFont{operators}{bold}{OT1}{fcmss}{bx}{n}

% fix \mathrm, which is broken by foils.cls:
\DeclareSymbolFontAlphabet{\mathrm}{operators}

% Notice that \mathrm is always the _upright_ font, 
% which is used for numbers and operator names.
% It's still upright, but sans serif now.

% Unf., there is no complete CM Sansserif Math Italic font.
% Do NOT typeset variables as sans serif upright, as this
% is ugly, wrong, misleading and the spacing will be too tight.

% we want vectors in math italic bold
\usepackage{bm}
\renewcommand{\vec}[1]{\bm{#1}}

\begin{document}
\foilhead{Subscripts are not seriffed: {\boldmath $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$}}

% Notice that \boldmath makes all formulas bold,
% within its scope.

{\bfseries\slshape Sansserif Slanted Bold is not available.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Newton's law for particle $i$:

$\vec{F}_i = \dot{\vec{p}}_i$

\item We see that text is sans serif, but math remains mostly CM.

\end{itemize}
