FWIW, there have been at least two items of spam sent over this list the
last week: one with a From: of walter54p@yahoo.de on the 14th and one with
a From: of daniel74@free.com on the 18th. Both had the header line

Return-Path: <tex-fonts-errors@sunshine.math.utah.edu>

when they arrived to me. My impression is however that most junk sent via
tex-fonts are viruses rather than spam.

It would probably be a good idea to add some filtering to the tex-fonts
list, so that most "bad" messages would bounce back to the sender rather
than be delivered to all the recipients. Such a filter could also help
enforcing the list rules about "no large attachments" and "no HTML".
Perhaps this is something for the administrator(s) to consider?

I think most of the needed functionality---the notable exception is the
part about attachments---comes out of the box with SpamBouncer
(http://www.spambouncer.org/). This program is essentially a collection of
procmail recepies, which means adding tests is probably not very hard. In
my experience it catches most spam (at least most of the spam I get),
although the two items mentioned above passed all its filters. That could
however be due to that our postmaster hasn't updated the program for a
while now.
