                  <p>Since 1991, the <strong><a href='http://sherlock-stock.com/080E10131B0632171F5C11130E434142444A440E414B0E400E41464A4B4447400E08.aspx'>Mattman 
                    Company (OTC: MMVS)</a></strong> has achieved a reputation 
                    as the premier manufacturer of specialized mobile units for 
                    municipalities, medical, and Fortune 500 corporations. The 
                    company's units are in service worldwide, including Beijing, 
                    Siberia, Egypt, and Venezuela, and across the United States 
                    from Boston to Tampa, and Eugene to San Diego. J. Mattman 
                    Security Inc., dba The Mattman Company was formed in 1983 
                    by former Secret Service agent Jurg Mattman with an initial 
                    focus on dignitary and VIP protection. Since then, the company 
                    has evolved in order to answer the increased safety demands 
                    of a security conscious world, and now manufactures custom 
                    vehicles and mobile units for a wide range of law enforcement, 
                    medical and homeland security applications. </p>
                  <p><span class="body_bold">Track Record of Service:</span> In 1984, the Mattman 
                    Company was selected by the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing 
                    Committee and <span class="body_bold">AT&T (NYSE: T)</span> to provide the 
                    security for the 1984 Olympic Torch Relay. In 1986, the Mattman 
                    Company provided nation-wide security for the event Hands 
                    Across America. Gaining recognition as experts in mega-events, 
                    the company provided risk management and security for Miller 
                    Brewing Company's "Biggest Party in History" and a <span class="body_bold">Philip 
                    Morris (NYSE: MO)</span> sponsored nationwide tour of the 
                    Bill of Rights in 1989 and 1990-1991 respectively. In addition 
                    to the high profile of many of the company's projects, its 
                    client satisfaction record is virtually unmatched. Among its 
                    list of clients that have purchased its vehicles, the <span class="body_bold">Mattman 
                    Company boasts a 96% return rate</span> among those customers 
                    requiring additional vehicles.</p>

                  <p><span class="body_bold">Growth Spurred by Demand:</span> On March 16, 2006, 
                    the White House released its National Security Strategy (NSS), 
                    in which the express purpose was to ensure the fulfillment 
                    of its most solemn obligation: to protect the security of 
                    the American people. As a result of this commitment, tens 
                    of billions of dollars have been allotted to various aspects 
                    of the Homeland Security sector, spelling huge potential rewards 
                    for the companies in position to efficiently and effectively 
                    service the nation's security needs. Mattman recently announced 
                    the expansion of its manufacturing facilities to meet the 
                    heavy demands of its one year backlog of orders that continue 
                    to flow in as the Department of Homeland Security continues 
                    to fund first responder vehicles for municipalities, counties, 
                    states, and federal agencies. With a 29,000 square foot facility, 
                    all aspects of the manufacturing, less paint are performed 
                    in-house.</p>
                  <p><span class="body_bold">High Standards of Quality:</span> Mattman's reputation 
                    in the security field is unmatched. Through the use of aerospace 
                    developed and time tested materials, MMSV offers complete 
                    ballistic protection to meet the needs of clients. All materials 
                    used are tested using U.S. government NIJ testing standards 
                    offering NIJ level II (9mm, .357, .45 handguns), through NIJ 
                    level IV (30.06 armor piercing rounds) security. The company's 
                    products have seen use in a wide range of public and private 
                    security applications, as well as with medical and counter-drug 
                    agencies, and even educational vehicles.</p>
                  <p><span class="body_bold">Diversity:</span> As security becomes a more pressing 
                    issue for all walks of life, the range of potential uses for 
                    Mattman products continues to expand. Already, the company's 
                    products have been employed by various law enforcement agencies 
                    for nearly fifteen years, including SWAT/Special Operations 
                    vehicles, Explosive Ordnance Demolition, Crime Labs, Command 
                    Posts and Sub Stations, DUI enforcement, Surveillance, Search 
                    & Rescue, and Counterdrug Programs. As the pressure on businesses 
                    to become international intensifies but tensions escalate, 
                    the demand for customized corporate vehicles is also growing. 
                    Of course, specialized medical vehicles are also in demand, 
                    and the Mattman Company is even equipped to provide mobile 
                    units for medical and educational applications to help serve 
                    rural and inner city needs as well as save in staffing and 
                    equipment requirements.</p>
                  <p><span class="body_bold">Enormous Revenue Potential:</span> Since 9/11, 
                    the shortcomings and lack of preparation on the part of the 
                    federal government were starkly exposed. In response, the 
                    administration reorganized and restructured federal security 
                    agencies and committed additional resources to ensuring Homeland 
                    Security. In addition, the failings of FEMA in the aftermath 
                    of hurricane Katrina have also highlighted the need for further 
                    dedication to emergency response. Total federal spending for 
                    homeland securities activities in just the 2006 fiscal year 
                    are projected to reach <span class="body_bold">a minimum of $50 billion.</span> 
                    In addition, the current market in the U.S. alone for specialty 
                    vehicles, first alert vehicles and medical vehicles is $10 
                    billion annually. Only a five percent market share of these 
                    two industries would result in <span class="body_bold">projected revenues 
                    of $300 million per annum. With approximately 18.5 million 
                    shares outstanding, such a market share would translate into 
                    revenues of over $16/share.</span></p>
