Hi.  I am working on an experiment where we are using dmdx to present
stimuli (IAPS & IADS), and simultaneously, collecting
psychophysiological data with biopac hardware and acknowledge software.
 We created a digital marker channel so that we could record the onset
of picture and sound presentation in acqknowledge.  The dmdx code that
we are using is <o 253> to turn the marker on, and <o 255> to turn the
marker off.  The on code precedes the picture and the off code follows
it, within the same frame.  The marker is working, however, there is a
delay (approx 5-7 seconds) from when the stimulus is presented and the
marker appears.  Does anyone have any suggestions for how I might
rectify this problem?  Thanks in advance,
Michelle
