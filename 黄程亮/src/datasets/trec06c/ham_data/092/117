Hi all,

We are having some problems with a word naming script (I will paste an excerpt 
below). It currently works fine on our Dell Inspiron 5100 running Windows XP. 
However, when we try to run it on a different computer, a Sony PC6-9401 laptop 
running Windows ME, we get this message:

unknown switch character 's' (ssspacebar)

We have tried everything we can think of, but don't really know what the error 
message means. We have checked the box in DMDX that says "Ignore unknown RTF 
character".

One potential reason for the problem may be that the RA who installed DMDX on 
the computer had a problem while installing instmsiw.

Any help anyone can give us would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance,
Corinne Haigh
