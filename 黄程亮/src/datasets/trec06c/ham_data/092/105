We are about to use DMDX in our u/g computer room to run a variety of simple
cognitive experiments. I seem to remember hearing that with critical timing,
computers don't like to be a) Connected to a LAN b) Even have their network
cards present despite not being connected to the network.

Does anybody know about this ?  Is b) really a problem ?  In our case we
were going to log users on 'locally', hopefully bypassing the network.

Second, I want to do some mobile testing on a laptop (Toshiba Tecra S1,
1.4ghhz centrino, 32mb Radeon 9000 video memory). This machine will not be
connected to the network at the time of testing nor indeed at any point
thereafter. , However, it still contains an inbuilt LAN card. Is this likely
to be a problem ? 

Thanks,

Darren Walker
