   Read the Sound section of the DMDX documentation for presenting audio 
simultaneously with a visual display.  You'll want to add something like / 
<wav> "filename.wav" %0 <svp start> /.  You'll need a wave file per item 
because DMDX will not play audio across items.  If you need continuous 
sound then the best you can do is a pause for a short delay parameter 
during the ISI.  You'll probably want to force the sound files to stay in 
memory if you're reusing them in a tightly time constrained fashion with 
the <medialife> keyword.  You'll probably want to set the subject's 
response time limit to the duration of your wave files too.

It's so stupid of modern civilization to have given up believing in the
