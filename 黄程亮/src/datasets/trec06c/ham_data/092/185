   You get a microphone that works with your sound card.  You set the 
recording properties of the volume control to use the microphone and if 
there's a 20dB microphone boost you turn it on.  Alternatively if you have 
access to a pre-amp (in our experience this is a better setup) you plug the 
mic into that and you plug the pre-amp's line output into the line input on 
the sound card and you set the volume control's recording settings to line 
input.  Then you see if you can see signal in DMDX's VOX calibration dialog 
and set it's settings (see 
http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhdigitalvoxcalibration.htm). 
Then you include <id digitalvox> in your item file.
