   Anyone ever have trouble with a long path name in a graphic frame?  For 
instance:

<fd 411>g"C:\MY DOCUMENTS\DANAprograms\iaps2\7700.bmp" <o 253>

   The item file that has that appears to crash my winME test box.  Nothing 
too surprising there as the machine is about as unstable as it could be and 
not require rebooting every week but it would also appear to have weird 
side effects on another XP machine (the <o 253> gets delayed by 
seconds).  If the graphics are moved into the directory that has the item 
file the XP machine is fine.  My XP development box has no trouble with it.
