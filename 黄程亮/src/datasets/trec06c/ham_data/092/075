I have an XP machine and when I run analyze, I have to do each analysis
twice.  The first time always throws an error:  "Analyze.exe has
encountered a problem and needs to close.  We are sorry for the
inconvenience."  So, I run it again and it always works the second time
-- as long as I select the same files.  As soon as I select a different
file, the error is thrown again.

does anyone else have this aggravating little problem?  if so, have you
figured out a way around it? 

(putting analyze.exe in the same directory as the files to be analyzed
doesn't help)

thanks

matthew
