Corinne,

    I got a DMDX error message like that - in my case, it was "unknown switch
character 'I'" - and it turned out that I had used quotation marks in the code
containing instructions to subjects. That is, I had instructions written inside
quotation marks, and there were nested quotation marks, like this:

<ln -1> "If the word contains the letter 'I' press the RIGHT button"

    As soon as I got rid of the nested quotation marks, the problem disappeared.

Don't know if that will help you, but thought I would mention it.
