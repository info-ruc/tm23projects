   Oh yeah, I remember now.  Same stuff with winME.  Totally un-obvious but 
you have to set their software up to manipulate the card the same way DMDX 
does which depends on which device you're using.  If for instance you are 
using the PIO12output24 you'll want to have all ports set for output in the 
Keithley garbage for DMDX to work but for TimeDX to work it needs to have 
port A set for input.  Of course if you're using the regular PIO12 device 
then TimeDX and DMDX use the same settings.  And the setup value for a port 
to be input is 1 (as opposed to 0 for output) and it's most opaque, I 
remember figuring that stuff out and thinking there was no way a regular 
user of DMDX was ever going to get it working.  Sure wish DMDX and TimeDX 
could do it for you but as I say the Keithley stuff is over engineered garbage.
