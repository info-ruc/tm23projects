Thanks very much for your swift reply Jonathan. The desktops won't be
serving up anything. The laptop has a hardware switch to enable/disable
wireless LAN so I think I'll be o.k. 

Cheers,

   No.  Machines are fast enough now that it's no longer an

   No.  If it's got a WiFi card you might consider disabling it.  I don't 
know if the wireless stuff draws on the CPU but it's a possibility.
