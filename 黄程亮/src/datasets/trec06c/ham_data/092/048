Hi All
I have to do some fieldwork recording subject response in naming task;=20=

hence I have to use a
laptop. I need an advice about the equipment that will enable me to=20
make good quality
recordings. My web search on the topic yield two options: a) a USB=20
microphone preamp; and
b) a USB headset like ones used for gaming that comes with in/line=20
amplifying capabilities.
According to equipment specification most of the hardware support=20
DirectX =85. Does this means that
equipment will work with DMDX as well? I am open for all suggestions.
  Thanks in advance.
