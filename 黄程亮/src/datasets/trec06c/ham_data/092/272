A Company engaged in gold and minerals exploration and development of gold and mineral properties in China. 

Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? Seee nowadays what happened.

Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for inflation.)

HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.

China is the world’s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China’s rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.

China is already the world’s 4th largest producer of gold — and will soon be the world’s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going gold-crazy!

Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed to provide full legal protection.

You can see China’s developing gold boom is building momentum.
