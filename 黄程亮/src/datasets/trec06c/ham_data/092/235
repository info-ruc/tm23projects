Sir/Madam,<BR>I am Dr. (Mrs.) Mariam Abacha, wife to the
late<BR>Nigerian Head of state, General Sani Abacha who
died<BR>on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active
service<BR>for our Country.I saw your contact in one of our
monthly <BR>directories here in nigeria, l am contacting you
with the <BR>confident that you will be of a great assistance to
me. <BR>Currently I have within my reach the sum of
US$45M<BR>(Fourty Five Million United States dollars cash
which<BR>l intend to use for investment purposes
outside<BR>Nigeria.<BR>This money came as a result of a payback
contract deal<BR>between my husband and a Russian firm in our
country's<BR>multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta steel plant
<BR>.&nbsp; The Russian partners returned my<BR>husbands share
being the above sum after his<BR>death.Presently, the new
civilian Government has<BR>intensified their probe into my
husbands financial<BR>resources which has led to the freezing of
all our<BR>accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all
our<BR>business licenses and the arrest of my First son.
In<BR>view of this I acted very fast to withdraw this
money<BR>from one of our finance houses before it was
closed<BR>down. I have deposited the money in a security
company<BR>with the help of very loyal officials of my
late<BR>husband. <BR>No record is known about this fund by the
government<BR>because there is no documentation showing that
we<BR>received such funds. Due to the current situation
in<BR>the country and government attitude to my family,
I<BR>cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek
your<BR>help in taking this funds out of the
sub-european<BR>region. Bearing in mind that you may assist me,
l have<BR>decided to give you 20% of the total sum as
your<BR>share. Your URGENT response is needed. Please
include<BR>your personal phone and fax numbers. Please do
not<BR>fail to contact me on the above e-mail
address<BR>on&nbsp; receipt of this mail so I can give you more
detial.<BR>&nbsp;WE HAVE SUFFERED<BR>&nbsp;ALOT IN THE HAND OF
NIGERIA PRESIDENT , <BR>PRESIDENT OLUSEGU OBASUNJO ,&nbsp;
(&nbsp;&nbsp; PLEASE HELP US&nbsp;&nbsp; )<BR>Regards&nbsp;
.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
