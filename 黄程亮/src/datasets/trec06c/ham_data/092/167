Mike,

I wonder if you could give me advice on a particular DMDX design issue I 
am trying to implement.

In an remote eye-tracking experiment, I am going to present my subjects 
with 4 different pictures while they listen to spoken sentences 
describing one of them. Their task is to choose the picture by naming 
its number. Is it possible to write a DMDX script in such a way that 
these 4 pictures are separate .jpg files but appear simultaneously on 
the screen, each in its quarter of the screen, in a scrambled order?
I can not figure it out myself, and the alternative is to create a 
picture consisting of 4. Then scrambling of the 4 pictures will require 
creating 4 versions of the composite picture, and it is a lot of work.

Thanks a lot,
