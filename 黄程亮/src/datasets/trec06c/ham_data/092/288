   Certainly if just RecordVocal by itself was specified then yes, it will 
record for the timeout's duration.  But I suspect it's behavior changed if 
the DigitalVox was added -- not necessarily predictably depending on how 
badly written a machine's drivers were.  However all that code is so 
complex given it's repeated re-writes to deal with various machines broken 
drivers that I was mainly trying to get it to work on all hardware and not 
maintain backwards compatibility (which is normally my number one 
priority).  Some days you just gotta compromise...

   Yeah, I seem to recall announcing the change but it was a while ago now.

   The wave format is my choice and if we really cared to have it specified 
in the item file we could.

   What part of the human voice is it that needs better than a 11kHz 96dB 
signal?  They want to analyze female sibilants?
