   DMDX doesn't gather responses across items.  You've already got a zero 
delay parameter so it's not going to get much better.  The only solution 
without changes to DMDX is to have the whole sentence presented regardless 
of responses.  It's faintly possible given that you're using the keyboard 
(as opposed to a polled input device) that DMDX could buffer up responses 
across items but you're into the sponsorship bracket there.
