I should have posted this to the list in the first place.  My mistake. 
I post it now so that others will potentially benefit from the

   XP.  I'll only use 98 if a machine doesn't have the resources to run

   As long as it's got over 128MB of RAM it's fine for XP.

   See, if this had gone to the list someone else would have benefited,
now
