RE:  TRANSFER OF ($26,000.000.00 USD}  TWENTY SIX

MILLION DOLLARS

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer ($26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six
million United States Dollars from a Prime Bank here
in South Africa to oversea account. First,I must
solicit your strictest confidence in this
transaction.This is by virtue of it's nature as being
utterly confidential. I am sure and have confidence of
your ability and reliability to prosecute a
transaction of this great magnitude.

I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the
said amount into your safe account for unward
investment.You can either provide us with an existing
account or to set up a new Bank account immediately to
receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end for this important business
trusting in you and believing that you will never let
me down either now or in future.

I am the Auditor general and the personal account
officer to a great late INDUSTRIALIST who has an
account in one of the prime banks here in South
Africa. The account was opened in 1996 and he died in
1998 without a written or oral WILL and since 1998
nobody has operated on this account again hence the
money is floating and if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing since the
bank has been sold on Wed,19th March,2003 to another
bank and the management of the bank is now ready to
release the fund to any foreigner who has the correct
information of the account before fully handing over
the management to the new bank. 
The owner of this account is a foreigner and no other
person knows about this account or anything concerning
it,the account has no other beneficiary and until 
his death he was the manager of the company.My
investigation through the National immigration
department proved to me as well that he was single as
at the point of his entry into the Republic of South
Africa.

We will start the first transfer with Six million
[$6,000.000].Upon successful transfer without any
disappointment from your side,we shall re-apply for
the payment of the remaining balance of 20 million to
your account.

The total amount involved is Twenty six million United
States Dollars only [$26,000.000.00].I want to first
transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million United States
Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account
abroad before the rest.But I don't know any foreigner,
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
money can not be approved to a local person here,but
can only be approved to any foreigner who has the
correct information of the account which I will
provide to you.

On confirmation of your willingness to receive this
fund in your account,I will involve my confidant
lawyer who is a government accredited attorney to the
bank to represent you in various offices here to
secure all the relevant documents in your name
required to make the transfer a success. I therefore
assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and
trouble free to both parties.

However, we will sign a binding agreement,to bind us
together when we meet face to face after the first
transfer of $6 Million before transferring the second
part of $20 Million.I am revealing this to you with
believe that you will never let me down in this
business. You are the first and the only person that I
am contacting for this business,so please reply
urgently so that I will inform you the next step to
take urgently. 

Send me full details of the account to be used for
this transfer,including your direct telephone and
fax numbers so that we can have a heart to heart
discussion.I want us to meet face to face to
build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that
will bind us together immediately after the first
transfer before we fly to your country for withdrawal,
sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable and will meet up with instruction of a key
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this
business. I need your strong assurance that you will
never,never let me down.

With my position and influence in the bank, the
money can be transferred to any foreigner's reliable
account that you can provide with assurance that this
money will be intact pending our physical arrival in
your country for sharing.The bank official Will
destroy all documents of transaction immediately we
receive this money leaving no trace to any place and
to build confidence.

You can call me for heart to heart discussion through
my private satellite phone which I secured for the
security and safety of this business as you know that
this business is confidential

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
private email address at:vitsliswaco@hotmail.com or
fax.

Regards,
mr ebere manboo
