   I've just realized that there is in fact a solution to a scrambling 
problem someone had a while ago involving selecting bitmaps randomly for 
the four corners of the screen.  While I'm probably too late for them as 
they have more than likely brute forced it the solution is worth writing up.

   The solution is to use macros.  You would have to use the mother of all 
multi-scrambling item files -- four scrambles -- but it's actually half way 
elegant.  Before the multi-scrambling is added to the item file it would 
look like this (assuming the centering <xyjustification> is used):

~1001 mA="some upper left quadrant filename"=;
~1002 mB="some upper right quadrant filename"=;
~1003 mC="some lower left quadrant filename"=;
~1004 mD="some lower right quadrant filename"=;
+1005 * <xy 0.25,0.25> g ~A ,
         <xy 0.75,0.25> g ~B ,
         <xy 0.25,0.75> g ~C ,
         <xy 0.75,0.75> g ~D ;

   Keeping track of what gets presented would be possible by loading 
counters with values and emitting them in the first four items.  The 
multi-scrambling would want to first scramble all macro A definition items, 
then the Bs and so on -- but I leave that as an exercise for someone that 
wants to use this...
