Hi all,

We have recently encountered a problem with one of our DMDX scripts, that seems 
to be resulting from the fact that we are using a French keyboard. 

When we run a script that works on an English keyboard (contains <ID keyboard>) 
we get an error message that says " Input device <keyboard> selection failed". 
It does say that the device <clavier> is available (Clavier is keyboard in 
French). When we change the script to read <ID clavier> the error message no 
longer appears, but the program does not respond to a spacebar press. 

Does anyone have any ideas about how we might fix this?

Thanks,
Corinne Haigh
