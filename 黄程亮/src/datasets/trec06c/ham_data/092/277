Hello everyone,

I am working on a cuing paradigm experiment in which four independent responses
are needed.  For example, If cue A appears than the participant uses the left
hand, which has a correct X response and an incorrect Y response.  If cue B
appears then the participant uses the right hand, which has a correct X
response and an incorrect Y response.  Thus, with positive and negative
mappings, I am unable to determine if the correct hand was used in responding. 

I am aware of and have used <zil> before, which of course gives me the exact
button that was used. However, I was wondering if I have missed an update or
something that would allow me to map the four independent mappings still using
<azk> so that "analyze" could still be used.  If not, is there an extractor for
zillion that would expedite the analysis of the data?


Peace and thanks
Ted
