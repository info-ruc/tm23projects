Hi Irina.  

Heres a bit of code I'm working on at the mo which presents two bitmaps
simultaneously (with one overlapping the other).

+1 *  <XY 200, 100> <bmp> "y", <XY 450,100> <bmp>  "black", <XY
200,-100> <bmp>  "black" ;

My screens set to 800x600 for the above code, and my pics are 400x400.
Check out the DMDX helpfile for the "XY Keyword" for more info. The "XY
Justification Keyword" might be useful too. Mike has a good tutorial on
pic presentation on his site:
http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/Language/DMDX/paradigms/parad7.html .

Please note that the negative Y co-ordinate for one of the bmp's up here
actually places part of that pic off screen. 

If you have a lot of different pictures which need to be randomly placed
into the 4 corners of the screen (in random combinations of all the
pictures), your best bet it to use excel to create your rtf files. There
might be a cunning way to get dmdx to do that sort of thing to, but I'm
stuck for ideas.  Andy.

Mike,

I wonder if you could give me advice on a particular DMDX design issue I

am trying to implement.

In an remote eye-tracking experiment, I am going to present my subjects 
with 4 different pictures while they listen to spoken sentences 
describing one of them. Their task is to choose the picture by naming 
its number. Is it possible to write a DMDX script in such a way that 
these 4 pictures are separate .jpg files but appear simultaneously on 
the screen, each in its quarter of the screen, in a scrambled order?
I can not figure it out myself, and the alternative is to create a 
picture consisting of 4. Then scrambling of the 4 pictures will require 
creating 4 versions of the composite picture, and it is a lot of work.

Thanks a lot,
