   Because the display is continuously active across items in the loop the 
minimum time it can display a mask for is three ticks, one frame at the end 
of 1002, one frame in the inter item interval (assuming the minimum delay 
parameter D1) and at least one frame at the start of the next iteration of 
1002.

   Yep.

>- what extra information would I get if I "emit" the counters?

   It would be an easier way to see how much de-masking had been 
done.  Just emitting counter 3 would suffice would be my guess but that 
example looks broken.  For a start there are two clockons in 1002 which 
isn't right and decrementing counter 3 when it starts at 1 doesn't look 
right either.  I would expect counter 2 to be decremented and 3 to 
incremented.  And there's no space in the <dec3> keyword in 1002 either, it 
should be <dec 3>.  I'd be going back the reference here, the example 
posted looks badly busted.

   They'll find their targets but things will be hopelessly screwed up 
unless you very carefully scramble things so as to keep items together that 
are part of the same progressively de-masked stimulus.  There are an number 
of different ways that can be achieved, either the traditional way using a 
fixed grouping parameter G and having the same number of items in each 
presentation or by using the variable grouping keyword <vg> and having each 
presentation group's item numbers differ by modulo 100 or so, although the 
example looks like <vg 1000> would be the right thing to use.

   You can reuse the same counters.
