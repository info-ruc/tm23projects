   ISA PIO cards can function under XP -- not guaranteed but it's 
possible.  If you have the Computer Boards ISA card you might try it under 
XP with their InstaCal software and drivers.  We have moved away from ISA 
cards not so much because of XP but because almost all motherboards no 
longer have ISA slots.  Assuming you need the PCI card for the same reasons 
use the PCI-DIO24 (it's actually cheaper than a new ISA card):
