I tried the help files first, but was not able to able to find the info
that I need, so please help if you can.

I am creating a sound script in which I want to first present a visual
fixation cue and then a sound.  In order to get the timing as I want it
to be, I have to put it all in the same line.  The problem is that the
visual fixation cue remains on the screen while the sound is being
presented, and I don't want it to.  I want a blank screen during sound
presentation.  Any suggestions?

Thanks, Michelle
