Hi,
    After having crossed some tough hurdles, there is an easy and minor one I can't handle and need help. I want to let the comprehension questions stay longer or stay till a response is given. Now they disappear in less than a second (my estimate). I tried <fd 1000> at the parameter line, tried <ms% 1000>, <% 1000> within the frame, added a / after the question, all combinations, and none worked. <ms% 1000> worked for the instructions. Part of the item file at the bottom. Help will be appreciated.. Nan Jiang
