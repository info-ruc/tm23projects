   You can merge graphics across items so scramble could be used to mix up 
which four graphics are to be displayed but you wouldn't be able to get 
them on the screen simultaneously.  If the first frame of an item has a 
no-erase switch (! or <NoErase> etc) it will merge the previous item's 
display with that frame.  In the bad old days we could have set the palette 
to all black till the fourth item but palette manipulation is a thing of 
the past.  Best you could do on a fast machine is pre-load the four 
graphics using <MediaLife> and have them appear over four ticks with <Delay 
1> in the items.

If you pick up a starving dog and make him prosperous, he will not bite
you.  This is the principal difference between a dog and a man.
