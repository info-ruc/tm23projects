Hi. I am trying to do progressive demasking with DMDX. I have read the =
previous posts about it, and it seems that this would be the correct =
code:

>>~1000 <set 1,29> <set 2, 26> <set 3,1>;
>>~1001 <bicLT 1,4,1005>;
>>+1002 <%ctr 2> * "########" / <%ctr 3>  * " house " <dec 1> <inc 2> =
<dec3> <binr -1001> / "########";
>>~1003 <binr 1005>;
>>~1004 <bu 2000>;
>>+1005 %3  "########" / * %27 " house " / %2  "########" /  %28 " house =
" / %1  "########" /  %29 " house " / ;

Unfortunately, I have read the DMDX documentation and this piece of code =
again and again and I still don=B4t understand it completely...
I would appreciate if somebody can explain me it a little.
My main questions are:
- why item 1005 is hard coded? (it is explained in the previous posts =
but i still don't get it).
- what does the unconditional branch do exactly? is 2000 the next item?
- what extra information would I get if I "emit" the counters?
- with a code like this, with multiple lines for each item and with such =
a branching system, can I use an automatic scramble with it? if the item =
lines change its positions for each subject, will the branching find its =
targets?
- finally, for the next item, should I create three different new =
counters with numbers 4, 5 and 6, or just can I reset the same counters?

Thank you in advance.
