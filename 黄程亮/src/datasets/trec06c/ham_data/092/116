Hello.  I am wondering if anyone can help me with the following problem.
 I am in the process of upgrading the computer I will be presenting my
stimulus on, and I've run into a problem.  I currently have an ISA I/O
card for dmdx and I need a PCI I/O card for dmdx.  Does anyone know
where I can make such an acquisition?  Thanks,
Michelle
