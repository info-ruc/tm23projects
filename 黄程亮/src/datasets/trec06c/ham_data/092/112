   That's interesting, I always wondered how you were supposed to get XP 
installed on a machine with a wireless card without getting the Blaster on 
it.  With ethernet you simply unplug the machine, install XP, turn on the 
firewall on and then plug the network in.  But if it's wireless and you 
can't turn it off in the BIOS what are you going to do?  A hardware switch 
is a very welcome solution.
