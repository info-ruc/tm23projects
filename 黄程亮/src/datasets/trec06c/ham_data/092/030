   Was thinking about progressive de-masking this morning and realized that 
the first clockon has to be the one that is left in the item file and the 
subject timeout has to be set to whatever 30 ticks evaluates to.  The 
problem with these kinds of displays is that while DMDX can do quite 
sophisticated things with the display across items you can't gather 
responses across items.  So the clock must be turned on when the mask is 
displayed to catch any response made to the previous iteration of the loop 
and the response timeout has to be set so that the duration of the mask is 
not lengthened.  It still means there's a couple of ticks where a response 
could be made that DMDX won't see, or at least that it will probably not 
see till the beginning of the next item.

   If you are what you eat, does that mean Euelle Gibbons really
