   There's a slight oversight in the Instacal code that I've yet to fix and 
it requires that there be devices starting from board number 0 with no gaps 
in order for TimeDX or DMDX to see them.  So run the Instacal stuff and 
renumber the first card to be board 0 and the second one to be board 1.  If 
the demo board is still there as board 0 that's fine, make your boards 1 and 2.
