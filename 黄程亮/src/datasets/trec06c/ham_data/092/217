Hello Team:=20

Thank you for the volunteers so far...

I still need presenters for:=20
   1. Selecting landscape plants
    2. Fertilizing edible plants & fertilizing ornamental plants

AND as always I will need volunteers for:
      2 welcome table setup/greeters/takedown;
      1 person to set up/take down  the FOHC signs;
      1 person to pick up the audio systems at the office, set them up & =
return them to the office;=20
       1 person to serve as the 'keep it moving person'--to do this task =
you need to be willing to politely but firmly and cheerfully move the =
speakers along and keep the public from getting too far astray on the =
questions so we don't cut in to the last presenter's time; and =20
      'floaters' to help with general setup, including the rain/sun =
shelters & the bathroom supplies setup.=20

 Theresa Luza has offered to present "growing citrus";
   Gail will present "working in cover crops";
   and Chuck & Cathy will reprise " growing blueberries".

Please let me know as soon as you can if you can  perform any of these =
functions . Thank you so much!!                    Teresa

Subject: URGENT-Request for Presenters for the March 6 FOHC workshop



Hello- time to prepare for the March 6 workshop. Please let me know by =
Sunday, Feb. 22, if you would be willing to present for the following =
topics:

1. Growing citrus
2. Growing blueberries
3. Selecting landscape plants
4. Fertilizing edible plants & fertilizing ornamental plants
5. Working cover plants into the soil

The 'Practice ' session for this workshop will be on February 28th @ =
2:00 PM at the FOHC. Please be sure that you can attend this session if =
you are a presenter, UNLESS you have done the same presentation before =
(eg the blueberries).=20

I will assume that the citrus presenter will have coordinated with Phil, =
the Orchard lead.

Judy & Chuck are discussing the handouts, let them know if you have =
suggestions.

Help!!  I will NOT be able to attend the practice on the 28th, so I =
would like someone to be a time-keeper feedback person for me at that =
session and let me know :=20
     the order of events agreed to;
     the length of time for each presentation;=20
     where each part will take place;=20
     whether one group or more will be needed based on past experience, =
although I would assume with all the press lately we will have more =
people than we might have; etc.
Whoever does this for me will need to push for a decision on each of =
these items after discussion takes place and send me an email confirming =
all decisions.   Thank you!!       Teresa =20
