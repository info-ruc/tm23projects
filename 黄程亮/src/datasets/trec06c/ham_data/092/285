Dear DMDXers,
             Having recently dowloaded DMDX 3.0.2.8, I ran into a slight 
problem with RecordVocal.  This version of DMDX has the lovely facility to 
specify the length of recording of naming responses after the trigger of the 
Digital VOX.  And, indeed, a parameter line such as this does exactly that:

N50 <d 120> <t 2000> <id "keyboard"> <id "DigitalVox"> <id "RecordVocal" 2000> 
<cr> <azk> <clfb> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 0>

However, when I ran an older naming file in which the period of recording was 
not specified, using this parameter line:

N50 <d 120> <t 2000> <id "keyboard"> <id "DigitalVox"> <id "RecordVocal"> <cr> 
<azk> <clfb> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 0>

I found that the resultant wav files were shorter than the timeout, with only a 
portion of the response actually recorded.  My understanding was that when the 
recording period is not specified for RecordVocal (i.e. in legacy mode) it will 
record for the entire timeout period, yet that is not what I have been getting.

I'm not sure if there is a very obvious reason for this problem that I am 
missing, but I have observed it on two quite different setups now.  In any 
case, given the added functionality allowed by specification of the recording 
period, the lack of legacy mode is not really a problem - I just thought it was 
worth flagging on the listserv.

Also, while on the topic of RecordVocal, the wav files generated are 22Hz 16-
bit, and I was wondering if it was possible to change this?  I would imagine it 
is not within DMDX, but would changing soundcard settings have any effect?  
Please forgive my ignorance here - I am asking on behalf of a researcher who 
would like to use the wav files DMDX generates for later acoustic analysis.

Regards,
Anna W.
