what's this?

Ok, I am running a little late. I'll email everything to you by tomorrow
just after class (I may or may no be able to come). I would be grateful
however if, before that time, someone pointed out to me, for each of the 6
promoters we are going to use (2 inducible 4 repressible) what the
mechanism of promotion/repression is (I am a little too lazy/busy to look
it up myself):

1. does each inducer/repressor bind directly to the DNA (like, say cAMP)
or does it bind to a constitutive repressor/inducer knocking off its
influence? The numerical model would be (slightly) different; I have
implemented both, it would take a few minutes to rerun everything.

2. can you give me whatever constants you have digged out (or estimated)
for each of these 6 promoters and the substances controlling them? I might
have a few of them, but I'd rather have as much info as possible. I am
interested in:

a. diffusion constants (of diffusable elements)
b. half lives (or degradation constants)
c. hill coefficient of the promoter
d. maximum tips out of the promoter (in the absence of repressor and/or
"infinite" amounts of promoter), this obviously also depends on the RBS
e. saturation level of the promoter: this is the amount of repressor (or
inducer) necessary to bring the tips to 1/2 the maximum level.

By the way, I am assuming distance between cells of the order of 1 micron.
Am I totally off?

E.

I forgot to mention a really important point that came to my mind talking
to you yesterday. Amanda, you said that signals are not degraded
enzymatically but by "natural chewing" from the cells. Then how are we
going to send to initial RESET signal?

I mean, we need a way to artificially remove both signals at the beginning
of time: as Drew pointed out, we can't assume they will be absent at the
beginning, since one cell might have accidentally turned on, initiaing a
cascade that will make every single cell in the tube -before we even plate
them - fluoresce either cyan or yellow.

One quick and dirty solution might be to add the sequence:

R0010 B0034 C0075 C0051 B0015

In other words, put the repressors controlling the two nor gates, lambdacI
(R0051) and TP901CI (R0075) under control of the LacI promoter (R0010). To
turn off our signals, we just put our cells (temporarily) on a low
glucose, high lactose diet, and get them back to making bands e.g. by
waiting till they have eaten up the lactose or by washing the plate with
beta-galactosidase (or something else cleaving lactose).

Other ideas?
