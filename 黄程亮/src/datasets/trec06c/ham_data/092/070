   More than likely, don't see any other blank frames.

   If you have somewhat old video cards it might be time to consider newer 
cards, with 10 frames and lower amounts of video memory DMDX won't be able 
to buffer the last few frames so has to move them into video memory once 
the item has started executing -- and something else is interfering with 
that every now and then.  That or use a less demanding video mode, say 16 
bit instead of 32 if you're using it.  If you have GeForce video cards and 
are running DMDX with a shortcut that overrides it's use of many display 
buffers it's time to download the later drivers that no longer have the 
yawning chasm of a bug that the earlier drivers did and stop using the 
-buffers 2 shortcut.
