Someone in our lab is trying to get dmdx work on his new laptop (Dell
Inspiron with XP).  TimeDX works fine and we've been able to save
several video modes to the registry, but DMDX crashes at the end of the
file when running syntax check (when trying to run a file directly, it
says that it can't open the rtfparsed.itm) The error that is thrown
during the syntax check is "set display mode failed, unknown direct draw
error".  He's got the most recent versions of DirectX and video drivers.
We've tried to run it at 640x480 and we've run DMDX in the mode for
"really bad video cards".

is there hope for this laptop?

thanks for your help

Matthew
