Cleansing research-project's data and conducting insightful analysis (data mining, statistical analysis) are requisites to reaching significant scientific conclusions. 

Intercon Systems introduced 'non hierarchical indexing' technology, that changes the approach to data access - a quantum leap for Information Retrieval methodology. DynaGraph was debuted, innovating the approach to data visualization, data mining and Statistical analysis. Analytical Methodologies for most data driven research projects have been improved significantly. 

To introduce and establish its methods to the research and education communities, Intercon offers DataSet V Beta for free review and implementation by your team, colleagues and students. We shall be grateful to receive your comments and guidance.

DataSet V features and technologies are presented and setup files are ready for downloading, at Intercon's web site: 
www.ds-dataset.com
