one way to avoid external pre-amps is to make sure you switch on the
MicBoost (+20dB) in the windows microophone control panel. This is an
internal amplifier which in my experience has worked fine. WE use HIFI
headsets with microphones here (axpect to pay ~80ˆ in europe)

A dell inspiron laptop with its standard sound card (don't have the
machine wioth me right now) works fine
