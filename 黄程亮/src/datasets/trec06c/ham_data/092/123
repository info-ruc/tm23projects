   Prior to DMaster for DirectX (DMDX) Dmastr had no keywords, every thing 
was single character switches, for instance %60 instead of <fd 60>.  So 
when there's a case of miss-matching quotes DMDX starts parsing all the 
characters inside the quotes as if they were legacy switches.  My guess is 
that you are using some sort of font in your RTF item file that is parsable 
under XP (because it can handle things like Unicode) but not under 
ME.  (How interesting, parsable isn't a word).  Not terribly surprising but 
the first recorded instance of it I recall.  I'd try and edit the file on 
the ME box, loading and saving it might be enough otherwise changing the 
font of the "Press SPACEBAR to start the Beat the Clock game" might do 
it.  Then there are the standard standbys of saving as text and loading it 
again after exiting Word to remove weirdness like this.
