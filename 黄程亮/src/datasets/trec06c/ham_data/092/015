   You'll certainly get display errors on slower machines and given that I 
recently fixed a problem with DMDX wasting time while looping in large item 
files it's more likely to have happened in the past but any errors that 
script makes (assuming it gets fixed as I mentioned) would leave the mask 
up for longer than a fixed duty cycle would dictate, not the 
stimulus.  Unless of course the machine is not up to displaying the raw 
item without the looping...
