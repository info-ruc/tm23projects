   Yes.  The time from the frame with the clockon in it till the 
vocalization threshold is reached.

   Precisely, what else could it be?  You must have poor sound card drivers 
or a poor sound card or you're using one of the earlier versions of DMDX 
that excelled in blowing poor drivers apart.  If you can't find updated 
drivers or another audio card you will have to start messing with the 
buffer size options available as parameters to the DigitalVOX and 
RecordVocal devices and hope that some combination gets around whatever is 
failing.
