Still no luck running the PIO test in timedx.  I've followed the advice
offered so far, and I am still getting error messages with regard to
the port and board numbers.  Is it possible that having two PCI cards
is causing a problem?  Any advice would be much appreciated.  Michelle

I'm wondering if anyone can help me with the following problem.  I've
just had a PCI-DIO24 card installed on a computer running dmdx.

When I try and run dmdx (or do a syntax check), I get the following
error message: "Error 1 Setting up InstaCal Board 1|Invalid board
number."

Then I run the PIO test in Time DX, it gives a dialogue box in which to
define the PIO address.  We have InstaCal Boards in both port 1 and 3
(don't ask why), and when we enter either "InstaCal Board 1 PCI-DIO24"
or "InstaCal Board 3 PCI-DIO24" as instructed in the Time DX help file,
we get the identical error message as above.  Yes, we checked that this
is in fact the board we are using.

Any help would be much appreciated.  Michelle
