               {MONEY TRANSACTION}

My name is Dr.Prince Ibe. and I work in the International
operation department in a Local Bank here in South Africa,
On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant domiciliary
account with a BAL. Of  36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD)
on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that
the account holder has long since passed away (dead)
leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will
approve this money to any foreigner because the former
operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Iraq in
particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead, and
nobody will come again for the claim of this money A
foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to
the account Holder; therefore I need your cooperation in
this transaction.

I will provide the necessary information needed in
order to claim this money, But you will need to open
an account where this can be transferred. If
interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax
number including full details of the account to be
used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality
in handling this transaction as my job and the future
of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.

I want to assure you that the transaction is without
risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally,
I will give you 25% for your corporation.

I look forward to a favorable response from you.

Yours

Dr.Prince Ibe.
