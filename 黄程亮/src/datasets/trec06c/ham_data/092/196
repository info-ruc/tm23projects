Hallo,
I'm working on a cross-modal priming experiment with a lexical decision
task.
My problem: I put a response deadline (that is the interval the target
remains on the screen) and, when subjects do not give a response before the
deadline has expired, a warning message should appear. That is easy to do
with a feedback instruction, BUT I NEED TO CHANGE THE FEEDBACK FOR THE NON
RESPONSE ,THAT IS BY DEFAULT "NO RESPONSE" (as I'm working in Italian
language) AND I CAN'T FIND OUT HOW TO DO IT even if it sounds dummy (I could
only change the right/wrong feddback messages).
Can somebody help me?
Thank you and bye
Paola
