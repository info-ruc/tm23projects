I have a problem with a lab class we want to run.  We have written (and 
tested) the task but I ma having trouble getting DMDX to work in the lab.

The lab uses Intel 845G (intergrated motherboards, 82845G based video) 
running Win2k, I've tried DMDX 2.2 and 3.0 with DirectX 8.1 and 9.0a, I've 
upgraded the video drivers to the latest that Intel provide (v14.1) but it 
just does not work in the lab.

It does work the same hardware and Win2K in the office but not in the lab.

If I run TimeDX in the lab and try any video test it says "Driectx reports 
unable to page flip".

The lab does have some different permissions (multi user teaching lab) and 
it may be some difference in the setup but can anyone suggest what I need 
to look for.  I've tried things like changing the user, even tried running 
as Administrator.  I've check the video setting and it has 8Meg assigned to 
the video.

Thanks in advance
PETEr
