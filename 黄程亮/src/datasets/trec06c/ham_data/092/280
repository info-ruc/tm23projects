   Some days a video chipset just ain't up to it, unable to flip pages is a 
very basic low level thing and if it doesn't go away with new video drivers 
the only thing that might possibly save you is to try different video modes 
but I'll be impressed.  It's faintly possible that there's a setting in the 
BIOS called AGP aperture size that might affect the video chipset seeing as 
you mention that there's another machine with the same chipset that works 
-- but I doubt it, page flipping isn't related to aperture size.  If push 
really comes to shove you could try flashing the BIOS.

   My guess is you'll have to disable the built in video and buy another 
video card.  If you have an AGP slot then almost anything will be ok, if 
not you'll have to hunt up a PCI video card.
