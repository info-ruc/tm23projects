   Look at the item in the diagnostic window before the syntax error was 
hit, it'll be the one with the mistake.  Knowing which item produces the 
error is essential if it's really an error in the item file.

   I guess it's possible things are screwed up because you installed 
instmsiW instead of instmsiA, the W is the unicode Wide version of the 
installer (for XP and 2000) whereas the A version is for non-unicode 
machines (95, 98, ME).  If you can remove it do so and use the DMDX 
setup.exe to determine what needs to be done.
