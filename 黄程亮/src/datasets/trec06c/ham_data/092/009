Hi,

I only have experience using the Keithley card in Win2000, and it has been
a while ago. Did you create and configure a device in the DriverLINX 
configuration
panel? I'm not sure what the default settings are, but mine has its digital 
input
set to reveive at channels 0-7, values 0-255, 'SetUp' is 0x1 and the 
'initialise'
radio-button is selected. It is also switched to 'Hex'. Most of this must be
standard settings, but I do remember playing with some of those values
before it would work on my machine.

Good luck,

Maarten
