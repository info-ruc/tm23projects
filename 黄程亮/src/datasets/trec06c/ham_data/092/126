   Nonetheless the last item displayed in DMDX's window or the last line in 
diagnostics.txt will be the one that caused the error.

   You usually have to delete any $ symbols too when you remove scrambling.

   Read the scrambling documentation, there are a number of files left 
behind that are the intermediate files as DMDX processes them and the clue 
to your problems will be found in one of them.  It's possible what you see 
on the screen is not what DMDX sees as it parses a file due to RTF codes 
and so forth.
