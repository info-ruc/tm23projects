Thank you for your reply.  I knew I was overcomplicating things!
Now unfortunately, I keep receiving the same reaction times (300ms) for
each response no matter how long I wait or how quickly I answer.  What
exactly is this reaction time for each item measuring? Is it the time
from when the stimulus appears until the threshold (set through the
digitalvox calibration) is reached? If not this then what?
Thank you again

   You get a microphone that works with your sound card.  You set the 
recording properties of the volume control to use the microphone and if 
there's a 20dB microphone boost you turn it on.  Alternatively if you
have 
access to a pre-amp (in our experience this is a better setup) you plug
the 
mic into that and you plug the pre-amp's line output into the line input
on 
the sound card and you set the volume control's recording settings to
line 
input.  Then you see if you can see signal in DMDX's VOX calibration
dialog 
and set it's settings (see 
http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhdigitalvoxcalibra
tion.htm). 
Then you include <id digitalvox> in your item file.
