CS352H-ers,

On thursday I will be talking more about the project assignment and
about pair programming.  Please make sure to read the pair programming
paper that I handed out a couple of weeks ago.  If you need a copy,
you can find it outside my assistants door - ACES 3.422.

Also, please read the papers on caching and VM that I handed out in
class by next Tuesday (Oct. 28 - there may be a pop quiz at the
beginning of class).

Cheers,
