Lagos-Nigeria.

ATTN: Mr.Christopher Phillips

Dear Sir,

                    STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Femi Ajayi, The manager, Bills and Exchange at
the Foreign Remittance Department of the Union Bank of
Nigeria Plc. I am writing this letter to ask for your
support and cooperation to carry out this business
opportunity in my department. 

We discovered an abandoned sum of $21,500,000.00
(Twenty-one million Five Hundred Thousand United
States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of
our foreign customers who died along with his
entire family of a wife and two children in November
1997 in a Plane crash.

Since we heard of his death, we have been expecting
his next-of-kin to come over and put claims for his
money as the heir, because we cannot release the funds
from his account unless someone applies for Claim as
the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our
banking Guidelines. Unfortunately, neither their
family members nor distant relatives have Ever
appeared to claim the said fundS. Upon this
discovery, other Officials in my department and I,
have agreed to make business with you and release the
total amount into your account as the heir of the fund
since no one came for it or discovered he maintained
account with our bank, otherwise the funds will be
returned to the bank's treasury as unclaimed funds.

We have agreed that our ratio of sharing will be as
stated thus;20% for you as foreign partner,75% for us
the officials in my department and 5% for the
settlement of all local and foreign expenses incurred
by us and you during the course of this business.

Upon the successful completion of this transfer, 
one of my colleagues  and I will come to your country
and mind our share. It is from our 75 % we intend to
invest in (estate) and import Agricultural Machineries
into my country as a way of recycling the 
fund. To commence this transaction, we require you to
immediately indicate your interest by a return e-mail
to this confidential address{sixteen_sixty@homeworkers-net.com} and
enclose your private contact telephone number, fax
number,full name and address and your designated bank
coordinates to enable us file letters of claim to the 
appropriate departments for necessary approvals before
the transfer can be made. Note also, that this
transaction must be kept STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL because
of its nature.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

Femi Ajayi,
Union Bank of Nigeria
