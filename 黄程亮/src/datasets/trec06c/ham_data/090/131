Event:    Computer Architecture Seminar Series
          http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/arch

Speaker:  Carl Anderson
          IBM

Title:    "Physical Design of High Performance Microprocessors" 

Date:     Monday, October 6, 2003

Time:     3:30 pm 

Place:    ACES 2.402

Coffee:   3:00 pm

Host:     Chuck Moore


ABSTRACT:

The design methodology used for designing the Power4 and Power5
microprocessors will be described. How the methodology dealt with the
challenges of discipline, 170 to 250 million transistors, high frequency,
tight schedules, etc will be 
detailed.  The barriers of wire resistance, leakage, cost to future high 
performance processors will be discussed.

BIOGRAPHY:

Carl J. Anderson received his BS in physics from the University of Missouri
in 1974 and his PhD. in Physics from the University Wisconsin in 1979.  He
joined IBM Research in 1979 where he did circuit design, package design and
test on the Josephson Superconducting Computer program.  From 1983 to 1992
he worked in GaAs and Optoelectronics design and fabrication. In 1992 Carl
became the Si circuit design manager and was responsible for the conversion
of the S/390 high-end mainframe from bipolar technology to custom CMOS
technology.  In 1997 Carl started work on the Power4 microprocessor
responsible for the physical design.  Carl was appointed an IBM Fellow in
2000 and received and Honorary Doctor of Science Degree of the University of
Wisconsin in 2003.  Presently Carl is working on the next generation of IBM
processors and helping near term programs meet their performance goals.


The Computer Architecture Seminar Series is sponsored jointly by the
Departments of Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering and is
supported by a grant from SUN.
