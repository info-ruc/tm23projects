Event:    Computer Architecture Seminar Series
          http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/arch

Speaker:  Parthasarathy Ranganathan

Title:    "Energy Consumption in Mobile Devices: 
           Why Future Systems Need Requirements-Aware Energy Scale-Down" 

Date:     Friday, October 3, 2003

Time:     10:00 am 

Place:    ACES 2.402

Coffee:   9:00 am

Host:     Yale Patt


ABSTRACT:

The current proliferation of mobile devices has resulted in a large
diversity 
of designs, each optimized for a specific application, form-factor, battery 
life, and functionality (e.g., cell phone, pager, MP3 player, PDA, tablet, 
laptop). Recent trends, motivated by user preferences towards carrying less,

have focused on integrating these different applications in a single
general- purpose device, often resulting in much higher energy consumption
and 
consequently much reduced battery life. Our research argues that in order to

achieve longer battery life, such systems should be designed to include 
requirements-aware energy scale-down techniques. Such techniques would allow
a 
general-purpose device to use hardware mechanisms and software policies to 
adapt energy use to the user's requirements for the task at hand,
potentially 
approaching the low energy use of a special-purpose device. 

We make two main contributions. We first provide a model for energy
scale-down. We argue that one approach to design scale-down is to use
special-purpose 
devices as examples of power-efficient design points, and structure
adaptivity 
using insights from these design points. To understand the magnitude of the 
potential benefits, we present an energy comparison of a wide spectrum of 
mobile devices (to the best of our knowledge, the first study to do so).  
Based on the insights from this study, we propose and evaluate three
specific 
requirements-aware energy scale-down optimizations, in the context of the 
display, wireless, and CPU components of the system. Our optimizations
reduce 
the energy consumption of their targeted subsystems by factors of 2 to 10 
demonstrating the importance of energy scale-down in future designs. 

In the talk, I will primarily focus on display scale-down with focus on some

work we have done for laptops and handhelds. I will also briefly talk about 
our other work on processors, wireless, and servers. 

BIOGRAPHY:

Partha Ranganathan is currently a research scientist at Hewlett Packard
Labs. 
His research interests are in low-power system design,  system architecture,

and performance evaluation. His recent research focuses on designing power- 
and energy-efficient systems for future computing environments (from small 
mobile devices to dense servers in data centers). This work has led to a
class 
of "energy scale-down" optimizations that use adaptivity in resources to
match 
system energy efficiency with desired user functionality to achieve
significant energy savings.  Partha is currently exploring the potential of
energy scale- down optimizations in the context of the data center as part
of the data center architecture team. Partha received his B.Tech degree from
the Indian Institute 
of Technology, Madras and his M.S. and Ph.D. from Rice University, Houston.
He 
is a primary developer of the publicly distributed Rice Simulator for ILP 
Multiprocessors (RSIM), and a recipient of the Lodieska Stockbridge Vaughan 
fellowship and an IIT Madras Alumni Award. 

The Computer Architecture Seminar Series is sponsored jointly by the
Departments of Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering and is
supported by a grant from SUN.
