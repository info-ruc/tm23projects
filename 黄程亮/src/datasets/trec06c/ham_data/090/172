Hey CS352hers -

There were a couple of people that came to office hours today that I
wasn't able to help in the time allotted.  I will hold extra office hours
tomorrow from 1:45-2:15 to help answer questions on the exam and hw2
grading.  Make sure you compare hw2 and your exam to solution sets of both
before office hours.  I will be in Painter 5.36B as always.

Thanks,
Jenn Sartor
