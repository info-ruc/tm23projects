            {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL} 

  (RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD} 
  {ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS) 

Dear sir, 

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00USD)
One hundred and Twenty six million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c immediately
to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end of this important business trusting
in you and believing  in God that you will never let
me down 
either now or in future. 

I am Dr William Mark,the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on

this account again, after going through some old files
in the records, I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner
of this account is  Mr. Frankline Sullivan, a
foreigner, and a sailor, he died,  since 1993. And no
other person knows about this account or anything
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that
Frankline Sullivan
until his death was the manager  Frankline Coy.(pty).
SA. 


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account. 

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and
Twenty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six million 
United States Dollar] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a
local person here, without valid international foreign
passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner
with valid international passport or drivers license
and foreign a/c because the money is in us dollars and
the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Frankline Sullivan 
is a foreigner too, [and the money can only be
approved into a 
foreign [a/c]. 

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together. I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer, I am revealing this to you with
believe in God that you will never let me down in this
business, you are the first and the only person that I
am contacting for this business, so pleas reply
urgently so that I will inform you the next step to
take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the 
deposit. 

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any 
account of  your choice  where the fund will be safe.
Before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing
and investments. 

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
Because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
 capable  and will meet 
up with instruction of  a key bank official who is
deeply involved with me in this business. 

I need your strong assurance that you will never,never
let me down. With my influence and the position of the
bank official we can transfer this money to any
foreigner's reliable account which you can provide
with assurance that this money will be intact pending
our physical arrival in your country for sharing. The
bank official will destroy all documents of
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving
no trace to any place and to build confidence, you can
 come immediately  to discuss with me face to face
after which I will make 
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account. 

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position 
and influence to obtain all legal approvals for 
onward transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the 
relevant  ministries and foreign exchange departments.


At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have 
incurred during the process of transferring. 

I look forward to your earliest reply through this
email.

You should try to call me on my satelite phone no.
882-1646685262. 

If you are calling my No. dial the way you use to call
other NOS. 

Sincerely, 

Dr.jek.
