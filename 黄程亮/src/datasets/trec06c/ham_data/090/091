   Congress Reviews Foreign Worker Visa Programs
   By Caron Carlson
   September 17, 2003

   WASHINGTON--In  the  boom  times  of the late 1990s, U.S. corporations
   widely  turned  to  foreign  workers  to  fill  highly  skilled  jobs,
   particularly  in the technology field. Now, in the continuing economic
   downturn,  foreign  workers  are  being  blamed  for  displacing their
   homegrown counterparts.

   Wednesday,  Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., will introduce a bill crafted
   to  close  loopholes  in  employment  visa  laws,  which he says allow
   companies  to  hire  foreign  employees  and  outsource  them to other
   companies.

   "We must make sure that our immigration policies don't have a backlash
   effect  on displacing American workers," Chambliss said Tuesday. "[The
   bill]  will  end the practice of companies who are displacing American
   workers."

   The  Senate  Judiciary  Committee  Tuesday  took a look at the role of
   temporary work visas in the current economy. The technology industry's
   use  of  H-1B  visas  dropped approximately 75 percent last year, with
   initial  H-1B visa applications falling to 26,659 in 2002 from 105,692
   in  2001,  according  to the Department of Homeland Security Office of
   Immigration Security.

   Despite  the  statistics,  as unemployment rises in the United States,
   lawmakers are hearing from their constituents.

   "I  cannot  tell  you  how  many  workers  came up to me [in August in
   California]  and  said, 'I've been replaced by somebody I trained, and
   they're  getting  a  third  [the  salary] of what I got,'" Sen. Dianne
   Feinstein,  D-Calif.,  said  at  a  hearing  of  the  Senate Judiciary
   Committee  Tuesday. "Wherever I go, this program comes up and somebody
   tells me they've been replaced, and they are angry."

   Intel  Corp.,  which  employs close to 80,000 workers worldwide, hires
   individuals  through  the  H1-B  visa program when a position requires
   unique  or  difficult-to-find  skills,  Patrick Duffy, human resources
   attorney  at Intel, told lawmakers. Beginning in 2001, Intel decreased
   hiring  overall,  but  it  continues  to  hire H-1B applicants when it
   cannot  find  qualified  U.S.  workers,  Duffy  said.  The company has
   particular difficulty hiring U.S. citizens for positions in electrical
   engineering design and chemical engineering, he said.

   Duffy  contended  that  the  H-1B  visa program does not displace U.S.
   workers  and  ultimately  benefits  the  U.S.  economy.  Most  of  the
   company's  H-1B visa employees studied at U.S. universities and earned
   masters degrees and doctorates.

   "These are not temporary workers to us. The H-1B visa is just one step
   in  making these workers U.S. workers," Duffy said. "Hopefully they'll
   stay with Intel ... the rest of their lives."

   Large  corporations  that  rely  on skilled foreign workers are urging
   Congress  not  to pass short-term fixes that will later cause problems
   when  the  economy  recovers.  In  the  boom  times  of the late '90s,
   Ingersoll-Rand  Corp. had to take people off the payroll when the H-1B
   hiring  cap  was  lowered,  Elizabeth Dickson, adviser for Immigration
   Services  at  Ingersoll-Rand  in  Woodcliff Lake, N.J., told lawmakers
   Tuesday.

   "When  the [foreign worker hiring] cap reverts to 65,000, we are going
   to  have a lot of problems that we experienced both in 1997 and 1998,"
   Dickson  said.  "If  we  have a recovering economy, what are our needs
   going to be long term?"

   The  root of the problem, according to the industry officials, is that
   Americans  earn too few graduate degrees in the hard sciences, leaving
   the  domestic  pool of adequate engineering specializations too small.
   Contrary  to some assertions, industry officials said they do not hire
   foreign  workers  to  pay  them  less  than  they would pay Americans.
   Dickson  told  lawmakers  that  it  is  more expensive to hire foreign
   workers.

   "We  are  mostly  looking  to  hire U.S. workers. They're cheaper, and
   there  are  a  lot  less problems," Dickson said. "In the near term we
   simply must have access to foreign nationals. If we want to maintain a
   global edge, we want to have the best and the brightest working for us
   in the United States."

   American  engineers  argue  that corporate America's use of H-1B visas
   exacerbates the problem of engineering unemployment. Abuse of the visa
   program,  in  particular,  leaves  qualified  Americans  out  of work,
   according  to  John  Steadman,  president-elect  of  the  IEEE-USA  in
   Washington, D.C.

   "If  we  continue  down  this path, the United States is making itself
   increasingly  dependent  of foreign technical expertise, both here and
   abroad,"  Steadman  told  lawmakers,  urging the government to support
   programs  that  encourage  more  students--especially  minorities  and
   women--to go into the sciences.
