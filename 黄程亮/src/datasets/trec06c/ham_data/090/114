I am not able to get into the newsgroup at this point in time, but I
thought I'd send this message this way because some people wanted to know
the answer to this question before tomorrow...

I was asked in class today about 3.16.  It does say to give the answer
with an average of the gcc and spice numbers...  So I say average the 2
benchmarks and use that to calculate CPI.

Good luck,
Jenn
