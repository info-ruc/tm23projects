CS352h-ers,

I wanted to remind you to check the course schedule page for reading
assignments:

  http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/cs352h/schedule.html

For Thursday, please skim Appendix A - this covers the MIPS
instruction set and will be discussed in Thursday's lecture

For next Tuesday, please read the rest of Chapter 3 (3.6-3.15).  It
shouldn't be too time consuming.

Cheers,
