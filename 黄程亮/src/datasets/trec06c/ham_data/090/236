CS352hers -

We are going to ask you to turn in your files for problems 2, 3, and 4
that you created with verilog on homework 3 on paper as well as
electronically.  You can just print 1 copy of them for your group of 2 and
attach it to either group member's homework on Tuesday.  Please use
staples!!

Thank you,
Jenn Sartor
CS352h TA
