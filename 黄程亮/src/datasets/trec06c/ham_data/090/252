Dear Sir, 
REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided
to forward this proposal. We want a reliable person
who  could assist us to transfer the sum of Fifteen 
Million United States Dollars (US$15,000,000.00) into
his/her account. 
This fund resulted from an over-invoiced bill from
contract awarded under the budget allocation to my
ministry and the bill was approved for payment by the
concerned Ministries. The contract has been executed, 
commissioned and the contractor was paid the actual
cost of the contract. We are left with the balance of 
$15,000,000.00 as part of the over-invoiced
amount,which we have deliberately over estimated, for
our own.   
I am contacting you to be our custodan for this fund.
(1.) 25% for you (Account Owner)(2.) 70% for us (3.)5%
 for Tax, as may required by our Government and yours.
 As you may want to know and to make you less curious,
I got your address from adverts, in business directory
 that protrayed your establishment in good light. I am
the Secretary of the Contract Awarding Committee
(CAC)of  the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
(NNPC). This transaction is very much free from all
sorts of  RISK and TROUBLE from my Government. We have
been exercising patience for this opportunity for so
long and  to most of us this is a life time
opportunity we cannot affford to miss. 
To get this fund paid into your account, we have to
present a Payment Invoice from a foreign establishment
like  yours. With this invoice, we will seek approval
to transfer the fund within 14 banking days through
the APEX BANK  (CBN) to your designatd Bank Account. I
and one of my colleague involved in this deal will
come to your 
country to  arrange for our share upon the
confirmation from you that the money has been credited
into your nominated Bank Account.  
Consequently upon your acceptance of my proposal,
kindly confirm your interest by email to me through my
 e-mail:(gaius113@yahoo.com) your  indication by
mailing to me of your sincere and serious interest
will enable me fax you the procedure for operation. It
will surprise you why we choose you and trusted you
for this transaction. 
Yes,  we believe that good friends can be discovered
and business like this cannot be realized without
trust. This is why we  have decided to trust you for
this transaction. 
We are looking forward to doing this transaction with
you. Be further informed that everyone's interest and
security had been considered before you were
contacted. So be rest assured and feel free to go into
this  transaction.
Thanks,
Dr. Gaius Chikere
