New CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) PGP Key

The CERT/CC has generated a new PGP key. We use this key to sign all
outgoing email, including documents sent to this list.  Effective
immediately, this new key is available and will be valid until Monday,
November 1, 2004.  To obtain further information or to download the
new CERT/CC public PGP key, please visit

   <http://www.cert.org/contact_cert/encryptmail.html>
   or
   <https://www.cert.org/contact_cert/encryptmail.html>

A copy of the new key has also been included at the bottom of this
message and sent to public PGP key servers.

The passphrase used to protect the previous CERT/CC PGP key was
accidentally exposed to a small number of non-CERT/CC personnel with
whom we have a close working relationship. We have no reason to
believe the encrypted form of the private key was exposed in any way,
but in accordance with good key management practices, we have
generated a revocation certificate for the previous PGP key. The
revocation certificate for PGP key id 0x3D2BFD15 has also been
included below and sent to the public PGP key servers.

If you have any questions or comments regarding this information,
please contact our hotline at +1 412-268-7090 or email us at
cert@cert.org.
