Folks,

A couple of issues arose in the grading of HW #3.

- Some of you turned in only one written assignment for the pair, even
  though the HW #3 clearly stated that *only for the Verilog part of
  the assignment* were you to work in pairs and submit only one
  solution.

- In some cases both members of the pair submitted things using the
  turnin script for the Verilog part of the assignment.  This was a
  hassle because in more than one case, one of the submissions was
  garbage while the other was good.  It was a hassle for us to wade
  through this.

- Several of you did not turn in a hardcopy of your verilog code, even
  though the notes on the web page asked you to.

For HW #4:
  **** Turn in the book problems separately from your partner

  **** Only submit one set of verilog files per pair

  **** Check the web page (homework) for updates and notes regarding
       HW requirements.

Thanks,
