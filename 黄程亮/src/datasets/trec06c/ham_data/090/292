If you look inside the make_lc35 script

  csh> make_lc35 lc35.f

you will see that it produces an executable named lc35_vsim, instead
of "simv".  I created the script so you wouldn't have to deal with
some of the messiness of creating the verilog simulator executable.

The way to run this is with a command like the following:

  csh> lc35_vsim +vhex+fib.vhex +maxc5000

This tells it to read the program from the file fib.vhex and to
execute at most 5000 cycles.  Note that the .vhex file differs from
the .hex file, and it is created when you assemble your .asm using
the following program.

  csh> lc35_asm fib.asm

You should be able to follow the recipe at:

and obtain the proper results.
