            URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE
 Dear,
 
 This mail may come to you as a surprise, it is born out of sincere need for assistance. I got your contact through internet addresses.
 
 I am Mr David Da Silver Kambo the son of late Brigadier David Da Silver Snr. My father was Genaral Savimbi's core lieutenant during his junta. My father acquired his wealth through series of arm purchase he made for  the late general. This wealth, he deposited with a finance house at Cote d'Ivoir. Unfurtunately my father met his death through a bullet wound he sustained during the crises at Angola. 
 
 Before his death, he, in the presence of my mother gave me all the depositary document of the fund he made at Abidjan Cote d'Ivoir. He instructed us to go to Cote d'Ivoir for due business venture. It was my fathers friend who advised us to solicit for a foriegn business aid to help us invest this fund.
I have already contacted the director of the finance company regarding the deposit and confirm that everything is in order. I am here with my mother and my younger brother.
 
 All the neccessary detail will be given in due cause. The amount involve is twenty five million United State dollars ($25m). It is deposited as family valueables in a trunk box for safe keeping.
 
 Note that 5% has been maped out for all the expences made during the transaction. 15% will be for your kind assistance. Please I wish you also help us invest the remaining fund in any business of our choice.
 
 To facilitate the transaction, your details are required as follows:
          i)  Full names and Address  
         ii)  Telephone & Fax numbers
        iii)   Bank name,address &  Bank account.
So far I have gone with the finace director, it will not take more than seven  working days if you follow directions.
 
 It will be a great deal of thing to contact me on my private phone number: 225 07 694 990. 
 
 Thanks, and may the good Lord bless all your endevour.
David D .S. Kambo.
