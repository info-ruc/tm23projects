CS352h-ers,

On Tuesday, I will be passing around a sign-up sheet for pair
programming teams.  These will be teams of two that will work together
on the remaining programming assignments and submit a single version
of their code for both members of the team.

We will spend some time talking about pair programming in another
couple of lectures.  But the gist of it is that you and your partner
actually sit together and program together (as opposed to dividing up
the tasks between you and going off and implementing them separately).
This approach has shown repeatedly to produce better quality code (and
faster) than the partitioned approach in which each team member does
their own piece.

The key for the pair programming is a compatible schedule between the
two team members.  You should be able to identify at minimum 10 hours
per week in which you could meet and work together.  When you sign up
with your partner, I want to know what 10 hours those will be
(ie. Mondays 4-6pm, Wednesday 1-3pm, etc.).  I will not hold you to
meeting at those times every week, but I do want to ensure that you do
not have insurmountable scheduling conflicts.

Be prepared to sign up with a partner and please discuss your schedule
in advance.

Cheers,
