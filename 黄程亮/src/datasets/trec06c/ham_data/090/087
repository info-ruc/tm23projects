Event:    Computer Architecture Seminar Series
          http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/cart/arch

Speaker:  Krisztian Flautner
          ARM Ltd.

Title:    "Intelligent Energy Management for Systems-on-chip" 

Date:     Monday, September 22, 2003

Time:     3:30 pm 

Place:    ACES 2.402

Coffee:   3:00 pm

Host:     Doug Burger


ABSTRACT:

A critical concern for mobile handheld devices is the need to deliver 
high levels of performance given ever-diminishing power budgets. The 
need for low power is evident in mobile phones, where battery life per 
gram of battery has improved by a factor of 50 to 100 over the past 
seven years. These devices are increasingly running sophisticated 
workloads with widely varying resource requirements, which puts pressure 
on designers to optimize for an increasing number of use-cases. One of 
the most effective ways of bridging the gap between the different 
operating requirements is the use of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS).

This talk will cover ARM's Intelligent Energy Management (IEM) 
technology, which is a set of software and hardware components that 
enable the use of DVS and include predictive algorithms for determining 
the minimum required performance level of the processor. Deploying DVS 
is a particular challenge on system-on-chip designs and requires support 
from EDA tools. Our ongoing research addresses the need for 
self-characterizing systems that simplify validation, and open the door 
to power optimizations based on die-specific and ambient conditions. 
Razor is a prototype microarchitecture under development with the 
University of Michigan, which supports failure recovery to push the 
operating parameters of a system to its physical limits and beyond 
instead of always relying on parameters that satisfy worst-case 
conditions and always-correct operation.

Bio:

Krisztian Flautner is a Principal Researcher at ARM Limited. He holds 
Ph.D., M.S.E., and B.S.E. degrees in Computer Science and Engineering 
from the University of Michigan. His thesis explored the relevance of 
multithreading for interactive desktop workloads and described the 
implementation of an automatic power-management algorithm for processors 
supporting dynamic voltage scaling. Dr. Flautner's research interests 
are focused on simple ideas that enable high-performance low-power 
processing platforms to support advanced software environments. In the 
research group at ARM Limited, he is currently working on next 
generation ARM architectures.


The Computer Architecture Seminar Series is sponsored jointly by the
Departments of Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering and is
supported by a grant from AMD.
