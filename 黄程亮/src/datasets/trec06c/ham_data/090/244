CS352h-ers,

I understand that you all had great questions and discussion about
caching this week - that's awesome.

Next week, we will be talking about virtual memory.  Please read P&H
chapters 7.4-7.9 in advance of lecture - I've updated the semester
schedule on the web page to reflect this.

Cheers,
