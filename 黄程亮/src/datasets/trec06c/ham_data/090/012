This paper describes possibly the first self-organizing
(although I'm not quite sure) ad-hock network. The need of
a highly-mobile, robust, reliable and highly-efficient
computer network in the field (for military applications)
has initiated DARPA to sponsor research and development of
Packet Radio Network (PRNET).

The big advantage of PRNET is the mobility (wireless),
quick deployment, and ease of reconfiguration. The
self-configuration allows nodes to function as an
autonomous group by joining/leaving the network due to
changes in network topolgy. PRNET uses multi-hop for packet
routing. On the down side, the inability to send and
receive at the same time (an inherited property of
broadcasting), therefore PRNET implemented a scheduling
scheme, Carries Sense Multiple Access (CSMA).

This paper is pointing out that performance will likely to
suffer due to large neighborhoods but with out specifying
on how big is "large" (my assumption is more then 50 PR
nodes, since paper suggest the network size of about 50 PR
nodes). Also this paper does not give the explanation of
the limit of PR nodes is 138 (is it due to congestion, fast
queue growth, etc...). This paper is lacking implementation
detail how quality values being dammpred. The paper does
not mention the scalability of this system (with a little
exception of mentioning that there is a research in
progress with algorithms that would allow thousands of
nodes, again no specifics).

Obviouslythis protocol could benefit by allowing more
clients and better performance (assuming for more then 50
clients, most likely to congestion, or possibly an out-of
bounds queue growth). This project would also benefit by
increasing the limit to handle more then 16 neighbors. My
personal thought that this research project was a major
contribution to the wireless communications.
