Yes - if the immediate is negative, shift right.  In fact, you don't
have to worry about whether it is an immediate or non-immediate
instruction - op2 is created outside the ALU.

Yes - assume the op1 is PC, and op2 is the offset.  However, I think
the immediate for all the instructions you mentioned are sign-extended.

The TRAP instruction for the LC3 is supposed to create an address with
the top 8 bits zero and the bottom 8 bits the 8 bit trap vector
(remember this from the LC-2?).  I've been assuming that the trap
vector comes in on op2, rather than op1 - but you should state your
assumptions.

Assume that these are sign extended all the way to 16 bits (just like
the LC-2 did for AND).
