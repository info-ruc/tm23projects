CS352-ers,

I wanted to remind you that the reading assignment for Thursday is the
paper:

  D.A. Patterson and D.R. Ditzel, "The case for the reduced
  instruction set computer," ACM Computer Architecture News,
  8(6)25-33, Oct. 1980.

If you did not get this in class, you can pick it up from my assistant
Gem.  Her coordinates can be found on the class syllabus.

Also, HW #2 is now available on the course web site.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                     Computer Architecture and Technology Lab
