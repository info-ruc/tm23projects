Dear Sir,

REQEUST FOR URGENT JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT



It is with trust and confidence that I make this urgent business proposal to you. 

Your name was referred and recommended in confidence to me by a good friend who assured me of your reliability and trustworthiness because I have been very careful due to the sensitive nature of this transaction notwithstanding the present dishonesty that surrounds the world today.



I am Gen Ibrahim Usman one of the Special Adviser to the past Military Government in this position I was privileged to keep in my custody for the government, the sum of Sixty-eight Million U.S Dollars (US$68, 000,00) only to the knowledge of the head of state. 



This money was diverted from the money,. Which Untied Nations released through the Nigeria Government to ECOMOG (Peace Keeping Forces) for its operations in Liberia and Sierra Leone. Suddenly the former head of State died on the 8th June 1998. Now that the former head of state abruptly died I have this money still under my control but kept in the custody of a Finance and Security Company/Firm Oversea.



Due to restriction placed on me since the death of the former head of state, I cannot operate foreign account and cannot travel out of the country for contract and evacuation and safe keeping of this money.



Based on this, I need you as a partner whom I am entrust and channel this money for a proper investment and in a joint venture platform in your country. 



As soon as you contact me and finalize, my wife or my son will be coming to your country to have a meeting with you, through which you will sign a TRUST BOND or AGREEMENT with my family concerning the safety of the transaction and more so establishing a mutual understanding in both parties. Please be rest assured that the transaction is 100% risk free and must be treated with utmost confidentiality.



Lastly, I will be willing to offer you twenty-five percent (25%) of the total money for your assistance. Also 25% for joint venture investment in your country while 50% will be kept in your account for my private use. It is imperative to let you know that my aim of contacting you in this business in because of the good recommendation made about your good self and my personal love for your country as per investment, therefore, I will be relying on advise as regards investment in a blue clip stock in your country. Could you please reply on receipt of this letter using my E-mail Address.



Include your private Telephone and fax numbers in your reply for easy communication.



Thanks for your cooperation.



Sincerely,

Gen Ibrahim Usman (rtd)
