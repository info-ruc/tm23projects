CS352-ers,

On homework #1, I neglected to mention that I would like you all to
turn in your assembly programs electronically, as well as on paper.  The three files you should turn in are:

    fib.asm
    pow.asm
    fpow.asm

To submit these, type the following at a linux prompt:

  csh> turnin --submit skeckler hw1 fib.asm
  csh> turnin --submit skeckler hw1 pow.asm
  csh> turnin --submit skeckler hw1 fpow.asm

To make sure that your files were submitted correctly:

  csh> turnin --list skeckler hw1

Type

   csh> man turnin

for more info.

Please submit these electronically before class on Tuesday.

Cheers,
