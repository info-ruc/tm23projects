Summary on "Highly Dynamic Destination-Sequenced Distance-Vector Routing
(DSDV) for Mobile Computers"

This paper provides a new approach to the classic Distance Vector
Routing Protocol and makes it suitable to use in a ad-hoc environment.
This is a proactive routing protocol.

Like in Distance Vector Routing each station of the network maintains a
routing table which contains the path to each other station in the
network. In order to take care of the dynamically varying topology of
the ad-hoc network routing updates are transmitted periodically by all
stations to their neighbours(This period is calculated based on a metric
which takes into account the time difference between the first and best
route arrivals for a station). Updates are also sent if there is
substantial change in a route like a broken link(the "inf" metric
symbolizes such change in the route) The updates contain the sequence
number of the update from the sender, the destination address, number of
hops, and the sequence number of this route as stamped by the
destination. These updates enable stations to modify and keep their
routing tables up-to-date. When station receives an update it sees if
there are any routes with newer sequence numbers or better metrics. The
policy of choosing paths with better metrics when seq number is same may
cause route fluctuations at an alarming rate. Therefore the protocol
takes extra care to damp these fluctuations.

The protocol is loop free because the next node indicators to each
destination induce a tree rooted at that destination. When a node i
receives an update from k regarding the path to x, the path can be
something like x........ki. Now x starts the broadcast with a seq no.
's'. This 's' increases as we go towards i. i chooses k as next hop only
if current seq number is less than s. For i to form loop in the next hop
it has to choose a node from x.....k, which is not possible as they have
sequence numbers lower than current sequence number at i.


The paper does not mention clearly how the sequence are created and
incremented. This makes understanding the proof of the protocol being
loop free difficult and unclear. The paper basically talks about a
modified distance vector routing protocol but gives no idea as to why it
works better in an ad-hoc environment. There are no results to show that
the protocol works better in an adhoc environment as compared to the
standard Dist Vector Algo. Future work is to simulate results based on
this protocol.
