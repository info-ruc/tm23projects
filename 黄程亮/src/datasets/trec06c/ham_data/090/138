Dear Sir/Madam,    
 
I am Manager Ahmed Hamza. I am pleased to get across to you for a very ur=
gent
and profitable business proposal, this may come to you as a Surprise as
we have not met before. But I can trust a Person of your caliber. 
 
The intended business is thus, I am the Personal Account Manager to Mr.
Joseph Emmons a Foreigner resident here in Nigeria, he was an oil consult=
ant/Contractor
with the government parastatals. 
 
Mr. Joseph Emmons died from an automobile accident, my client, his wife
and their three children were involved in the accident along Lagos/Ibaban=

Express Road. Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the=

accident, since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my cl=
ients
extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these severa=
l
unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet=
,
to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence I contacted you=
.

 
I have to be sincere and honest with you, I contacted you to assist in re=
patriating
the money and property left behind by my late client before they get conf=
iscated
or declared unserviceable by Universal Trust Bank Plc where these huge de=
posits
were lodged. Particularly, the Universal Trust Bank Plc where the decease=
d
had an (fixed) account valued at about (USD 26.5 million dollars). 
 
Consequently, The Universal Trust Bank Plc issued me a notice to provide
the next of kin or have the account confiscated within the the next 21 of=
ficial
working days. since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives fo=
r
over 3 years now, please I seek your consent to present you as the next
of kin of the deceased since you have the same surname, so that the proce=
eds
of this account valued at (USD26.5 million dollars) can be paid to you an=
d
then you and I can share the money.
 
(1) 45% for you as the account owner
(2) 50% for I 
(3) 5% will be set aside to defray all incidental expenses both locally
and internationally during the cause of this transaction.
 
I know that you may not relate to my late client but I contact you on thi=
s
transaction based on the fact that you share the same surname with my lat=
e
client, it will be very easy to convince the bank since I have the necess=
ary
documents to backup the claim. I have all necessary legal documents that
can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your hones=
t
co-operation to enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this=

will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you fro=
m
any breach of the law. 
 
As soon as you agree to co-operate with me, I will meet with the official=
s
of our Universal Trust Bank Plc and present your information as the next
of kin to my late client together with some relevant documents, they will=

just go ahead and pay the money into your account and I will come over to=

your country for the sharing of the fund. 
 
Please get in touch with me on my Email: ahmed.hamza@mail.ee, to enable
us discuss further. please if you are not ready to transact this business=

with me, tell me so that I will look for other alternative to get this mo=
ney
from the Bank. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
Ahmed Hamza.
