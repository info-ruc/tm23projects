CS352H-ers,

There have some questions about the LC3.5 ISA:

> For LD, LEA, ST and BR I am assuming that we are to
> use the top 7 bits of op1 ( op1[15:9] ) and append it
> to the bottom 9 bits of op2 ( op2[8:0] ). Is that
> correct? I am assuming that op1 is the PC and op2 is

> appended to op2[10:0])

This assumption is incorrect.  All addresses in the LC3.5 are computed
relative to the PC and do not use the funny LC2 page concatenated with
offset.  Thus for LD, LEA, ST, and BR you are to add the sign extended
9 bit offset to the PC (*no concatenation*).

For JSR, you are to add the sign extended 11 bit offset to the PC
(again no concatenation).

Yes this is correct.

Yes.

It is probably more convenient to make out = op2, since all other
immediate values that come from the IR use op2.  Also note that you
need to force the top 8 bits to zero in order to properly index the
trap table.

You can assume that when the machine reaches 40 cents it gives the
vend signal and resets to the initial state.

> If we have 50 cents or 55 cents after the last coin,
> can we assume that we always return nickels?

I suppose - but I'd rather you return the minimum number of coins.

This is a good start and the right level of detail.  Make sure you
have it all connected up correctly.
