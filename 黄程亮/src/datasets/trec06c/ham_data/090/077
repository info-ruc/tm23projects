You can see China’s developing gold boom is building momentum. Rare opportunity for early investors!

Why consider CHINA GOLD CORP (CGDC)? See nowadays what happened:

• Rising gold prices are further accelerating this gold rush - The price of gold has up 250% over the past five years, and this is still only a quarter of when the price peaked 25 years ago. (Adjusted for inflation.)

• HUGE gold discovery in southwestern China - Resources have already been estimated by analysts at 14 million ounces...and the number keeps climbing.

• China is the world’s last great under-explored land-mass - Locked away in a Marxist time-warp with limited exploration technology, China’s rich virgin gold fields have been overlooked and ignored until recently.

• China is already the world’s 4th largest producer of gold — and will soon be the world’s #1 producer AND #1 consumer. The country is going gold-crazy!

• Foreign gold companies are now welcome - and the laws have been changed to provide full legal protection.

 Another day, another dollar But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof. Tailors and writers must mind the fashion Better to be safe than.. punch a 5th grader. Gie yer tongue mair holidays nor yer heid  No good carpenter does get good wuk bench. Adversity Makes Strange Bedfellows Orange yellow but yuh nah know if he sweet. Age is a very high price to pay for maturity If yuh plant plantain yuh can't reap cassava. A drowning man will clutch at straws. Tailors and writers must mind the fashion He Is Rich Enough That Wants Nothing Clath ah easy fuh dutty but hard fuh wash. Forbidden fruits create many jams Everything must have a beginning No matter how long a log stays in the water it does not become a crocodile  Great minds think alike Misery loves company Keep your friends close but your enemies closer Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked man ruling over a helpless people If yuh eye nah see, yuh mouth nah must talk. Knowing is not enough; We must Apply Willing is not enough; We must Do Abundance, like want, ruins many. A good name is better than a good face. Bread is the staff of life Birds of a feather flock together. C:\ is the root of all directories. A chat has nine lives.. Great groups from little icons grow. Life is like a good book, the more you get into it the more it makes sense Dishonest money dwindles away, but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow

When you become successful in any type of life, there are people who are not contributing to the motion A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor. Enough is as good as a feast  A penny saved makes Jack a dull boy. The longest rope has an end A calm sea does not make a skilled sailor. 
  Its a dogs life If Fortune calls, offer him a seat  No good carpenter does get good wuk bench. The righteous man leads a blameless life; blessed are his children after him When coconut fall from tree he can't fasten back. Rats desert a sinking ship Ask no questions and hear no lies The best doctors are Dr Diet, Dr Quiet and Dr Merryman There but for the grace of God go I  Never put off til tomorrow what you can do today A scalded cat fears cold water. 
  Many people know how to say nothing; few know when You cannot burn the candle at both ends Things that come to those who wait may be things left by those who got there first  One of these days is none of these days. The tongue ever turns to the aching tooth Teachers open the door, but you must enter by yourself A man is at his tallest when he stoops to help a child. The old believe everything, the middle aged suspect everything, the young know everything Lil boy nah climb ladder to turn big man. No news is good news If you get a good wife you will be happy, if you get a bad one you will become a philosopher  
  When children stand still they have done some ill The best throw of the dice is to throw them away  One mans meat is another mans poison! <br>
