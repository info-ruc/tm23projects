Good day,

I know that this letter will come to you as a surprise due to the fact thatwe
have not yet met each other before, but please be rest assured that there
is no cause for alarm. I have decided to notify you of my business proposal
because of your integrity and goodwill. I got your contact from a foreign
business associate that travels overseas frequently. I will tell you more
of my contact as we proceed further with the execution of this business.

In bringing this message to you, I have to say that I have no Intention
of causing you any personal pains or discomfort. I am Mr. Samuel.Savimbi, son
of the late rebel leader Jonas Savimbi of Angola who was killed on the 22nd
of February 2002.

Presently, I am desperately looking for a trustworthy person to assist me
in this confidential business. My late father, Jonas Savimbi lodged huge
sums of money realized from the sales of diamonds and other precious stones/metals
in different security and finance companies in Europe. My father is presently
is dead, and the movement of his family members (including me) is highly
restricted,all his bank accounts and properties have been frozen and seized.
We are forbidden to either travel abroad or out of our immediate localities.

Presently, I have just discovered a huge deposit made by my father from
the money realized from the last sales of diamonds before is death amounting
to US$16,000,000.00 (SIXTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS), my father had
deposited this money as diplomatic consignment with a security firmS in
Europe, I have called the security firm and they have confirm to me that
the consignment is with them. I have all the documents with me right now
that is needed to collect the consignment from the security firm, my father
has instructed the security firm in his deposit
request to release consignment to any three family members which includes
myself, my mother and only sister who is also dead incase of emergency or
death. Right now my family has given me the authority to do everything possible
to get the consignment out as this is the only hope we have now to bring
the family out of its present poor financial state.

I am therefore soliciting your help to have this consignment collected by
you and the funds transferred into your account. I will give you all the
necessary documentations to facilitate your collection of the consignment
personally in Europe. The government has no or will never have knowledge
of this business, so there is no need to be worried about

your safety. I guarantee you your safety. Once I have your complete assurance
that you can handle this, I will immediately send to you the relevant documents
that will enable you take possession of the consignments. This will include
certificate of deposit and all other relevant documents. Meanwhile all I
need from you now is as follows:

1. Confirmation of your ability to handle this.
2. Your word that you will keep this business as confidential as
possible at all times until we conclude this business.
3. Your Name and address, telephone and fax numbers for communication.

As soon as I get the above information from you, I will also send to you
a LETTER OF AUTHORITY and AGREEMENT to enable you clear the consignment
on my behalf. Note that this is a very safe transaction as the Angola government
has no knowledge that such money is still in existence.

However, in return for all your assistance and troubles we have decided
to offer you 15% of the total amount of money as your share and 5% for all
your expenses which will include your travel expenses to Amsterdam and every
other expenses you incur in the cause of this transaction, such as your
telephone bills etc, this makes a total of 20% my family has agreed to give
to you for helping us secure the money.

I am waiting for your response to enable us proceed,please direct your response
to this email address(ssamuel@hknetmail.com)

Regards,
S. Savimbi.
