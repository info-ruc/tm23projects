CS352h-ers,

If you didn't get a copy of the paper on pair programming - stop by
Gem's office (ACES 3.422) to get one.  It's an easy read that has some
helpful hints for making the pair programming work.

We can talk about these some the week after next.  As a reminder, I am
out of town M-Th next week (conference in California) so I will not be
holding office hours.  Jenn Sartor and Bill Mark will be lecturing on
memory systems.

Cheers,
