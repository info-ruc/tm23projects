CS352h-ers,

On Thursday I will be going over principles and practive of hardware
description languages - along with some examples.  The verilog
tutorial (some of which you have seen before) is up on the course web
site, on the handouts page.

I'd like you all to skim over the info in the tuturial and in the
verilog introduction (large packet) that I handed out in class today.
Take a brief look at this before Thursday so that we will all be on
the same page and so you can ask intelligent questions.

If you did not get a copy of the verilog introduction (large packet),
you can pick it up tomorrow from my assistant Gem in ACES 3.422.

I will have the electronic parts of HW #3 on the web site tonight.

Cheers,
