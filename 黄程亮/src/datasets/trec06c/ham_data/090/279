Hello,

Due to the large number of hosts that are either compromised or infected 
with one of the Microsoft Windows based worms, I will periodically send 
this announcement about hosts whose traffic is being blocked in order to 
suppress our involvement in the spreading of these worms as well as any 
other potentially malicious activity.

Here is what you need to do if your host is in the list:

1. Make sure that the host has been completely cleaned up. Unless the host 
is completely rebuilt, please make sure that the host is not running any 
rogue IRC bots, FTP servers, VNC, etc. Tools like "tcpview" and "procexp" 
from www.sysinternals.com should help to locate any such services.

2. Send an email message to security@ucsb.edu to inform us that
the host is now safe to be connected with the internet. When
referring to multiple IP addresses, please list the IP addresses
on separate lines. If you are not the NOC's official network contact for 
the address(es), then be sure to CC that person. If you decide to simply 
reply to this message, please do *not* include the complete lists of IPs. 
Please just include the IP(s) that you are writing to us about.

3. If you find any rogue services running, please include the type of 
service and the port that it was using.

Now, here is the list of the 45 blocked hosts:
