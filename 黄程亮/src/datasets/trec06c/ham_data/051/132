The HB is not within an order of magnitude of having enough memory,
and is lacking other hardware needed for virtual memory.

There is a project called ELKS (Embeddable Linux Kernel Subset) (STFW)
aimed at producing a linux-like environment on embedded systems.

If you really want Linux in a 'bot? 

Try
        http://wearables.www.media.mit.edu/projects/wearables/hands.html
        http://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/uClinux/
        http://www.uclinux.org/simm/
        http://www.cellcomputing.com/
        
You can compile and download to your handyboard from a Linux system,
however.  Works for me.

cjb.
