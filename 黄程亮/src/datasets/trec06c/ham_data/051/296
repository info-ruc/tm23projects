Hi,

  I saw that some else also had this error when trying to download to the
board in section 6 of the manual.  I am also getting this error.  I have
tried replacing the memory chip, the address hold chip, and the NAND
gates.  None of this has helped. I am hoping that the answer to the 
previous person who wrote about this error will work for me.  Thank you 
for the help.

Jason Parks
