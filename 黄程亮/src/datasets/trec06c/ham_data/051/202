Me again

	Now when I give servo_a5 or a7_init(1); the other servo shutters and 
nothing happens , when you unhook the sevo your not trying to drive the one 
you are kicks up but you can olny get it in varying speeds in one direction. 
Is it possible that the chip or the part generating the PWM signal is fried? 
all other aspects of the board work, just not the servos?

Thanxx

Alex
