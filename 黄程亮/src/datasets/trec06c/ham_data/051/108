  It is used when people want a persistant display across items and
want feedback.  With DMTG's insane screen clearing philosophy this
was possible, with DMDX's default behavior of a frame implicitly
clearing anything else remaining on the screen unless a no erase has
been set this is not possible, you couldn't specify a no erase for
the feedback, <fbocb> allows this.  In addition the erasing of the
feedback only clears a small rectangle on the screen where the
feedback was.

  <clfb> sets all the feedback messages to blank spaces and displays
them allowing a response contingent display so that the screen is
cleared when the subject responds.  I got tired of everyone wanting
to turn response contingency on just to do this and having all of the
concommitant problems that a response contingent item file has.
Setting <nfb> doesn't display any feedback at all, the display is not
erased by the subject's response.
