Hello all,

Has anyone had problems using DMDX to display videos?  I am trying to write
an item file that will play three videos simultaneously, but can't get it to
work.

The item

+1 <dv* 1> <pdvf 1> <dv 190, 50> “ball&tree”, <dv 800, 600>  “path” , <dv
800, 600>  “manner” / ;

gives a "missing clock-on switch" despite the help file saying that:

"When turning the clock on for responses at a given digital video frame with
the <DVClockOn> switch the normal DMDX clock on switch should not be used as
well"

BUT, adding the normal DMDX clock-on switch ( * ) like below

+1 <dv* 1> <pdvf 1> * <dv 190, 50> “ball&tree”, <dv 800, 600>  “path” , <dv
800, 600>  “manner” / ;

results in an item that only plays the last video entered in the item.  I've
rearranged these several times, and it will only play the last video in the
item.  Is this a bug, or am I writing it all wrong?

thanks for any help
