I am having some problems reading Exp-Board analog port, ports 16 to 23
seems OK, but ports 24 to 27 (I have not tested the lego ports yet) give =
me
variable readings, to make a probe i have used this simple code:

void main(void)
{
while(1){
printf("\n20: %d 24: %d",analog(20),analog(24));
sleep(0.4);
}
}

and i have a static reading of 252 for port 20, and for the port 24 I hav=
e a
variable reading, going from 251 to 255.

Someone can help?.


                    Thank You
