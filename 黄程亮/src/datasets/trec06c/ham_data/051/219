I have just helped 12 people build up the handy board with expansion board at a cost of 165 each. But I live in the Heart of Silicon Valley. I was able to get board and all but five components locally. Those were the 68HC11, LCD, 470 cap, inductor and the IR sensors.
The boards were from Douglas , a local company and very helpful.
The up side of building the board is that you get a chance to really understand what all the components do, The down side is you get to find pout what all the components do during debug.

If you have time and the resources to do it on your own and, someone to ask question of,  this can be a lot of fun.
Good luck with what ever route you take.
