Hi All

	The talrik bot running of a HB is doing serverly wierd things.
I'vew tested these servo's on a old RC Reciver and they work fine , and my 
handy board can drive other servo s fine(not hacked thoe) Problem is when I 
give servo_a7_init(1); the servo hooked to toc3(pa5) starts to shutter while 
a7 does nothing , checked for shorts , no other software is running , when 
you give servo_a7_pulse = 7000; which should be moving forward , a7 does 
nothing and a5 starts up backwards ! ??
Any suggestions ?

Thanx in advance
Alex

PS check wireing and its right , when you call servo_a5_init(1); it does 
same thing only reversed as above . About to pop caseing of theses servoes 
to see if there be a loose wire,. Ohh ya one more thing there running of a 
seprate 9v batt stepped down with diodes , wierd thing is is when you put 
your hand near the battery both servos start up forward, and with the HB  on 
and your hand is near the batt they go backwards?  Helllp

Thanx again!
