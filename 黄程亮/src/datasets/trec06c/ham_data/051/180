thanks
    I maily wanted it for building a cheap, viable Linux platform =
without
having to delve into a somewhat-costly PC/104 board or the like... does
anyone know of a cheap pc/104 or other small 486-based board available?
        thanks,
            --phil

Phil:
	Check out the Embedded PC section and the classified ads in the back of =
Circuit Cellar magazine.  There are probably a dozen PC/104 and other =
x86 boards available at various prices.
