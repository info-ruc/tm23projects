Do any of you have a more informative parts list?  (Or did I miss it on the
ftp site?) I am looking at buying the gear to build 25 handyboards for a
High school project and need to find out if it would be cheaper to buy/ have
the parts donated or purchase them in kit form.  The maual has a parts list,
but some of  the components don't have the specs that I need.  ie:
monolithic capacitors- What capacity, tolerence, etc.

Thanks in Advance,
Tyler
