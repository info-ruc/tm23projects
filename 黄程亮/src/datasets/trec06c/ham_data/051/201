I should have phrased it better.  I am a third year electrical engineering
student and am trying to teach a class of twenty High school kids some basic
electrical work in an after school project.  I wanted them to get the
experience of working with the design (soldering, assembly, diagnostics,
etc).  Since we will be using the boards in robots for a contest at the end
of the year, I already have a lot of mail orders I have to make (Rat Shack
doesn't cut it for sensors, etc).  Usually the shipping price for ordering
five parts is about the same as ordering fifty.  I think that given prices
that I have seen, I should be able to order the parts for the boards
individually and cut about 25 percent off of the end cost.  I also have
tenative agreements with organizations like IEEE to donate some parts and
loan us some tools.  Since the cost of this project will solely be absorbed
by the students, I feel compelled to save them as much money as possible.

Thanks for your attention,
Tyler
