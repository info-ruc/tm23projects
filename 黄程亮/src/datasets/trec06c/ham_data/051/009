Hello Jos=E9 Luis,

I tried your test code and had the same results.  Next I connected
the analog ports to the wiper of a 10k pot going from ground to +5V.
The readings were stable on ports 16-23, but 24-27 jumped between
the appropriate reading and 255.  This was done on an older HB and
exp-board.  I next tried it on my HB and exp-board that arrived just
today from Gleason Research and had exactly the same results.  At
this point I haven't done any further testing ... but will in the
morning.
