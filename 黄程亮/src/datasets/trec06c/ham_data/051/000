Thank you for your e-mail.  Over the past year, we have received an 
average of 3,500 messages per month via this e-mail address.  As you 
can imagine, providing quick and accurate replies has become a 
challenge.  In order to respond more quickly, we have implemented our 
Seminole Online Service (SOS):  "We're here to help!"  SOS provides the 
tools necessary to answer all of your questions about Florida State 
University in the most efficient way possible.


SOS AUTO-REPLY OPTIONS

*Please note that your original message to FSU will not receive any 
further response.* 

The SOS is a treasury of responses to a wealth of *frequently asked 
questions* (FAQ's) concerning requirements, costs, housing, etc.  
Auto-reply options are presently available only to students applying 
for undergraduate degrees.

U.S. Graduate students should send correspondence to 
<gradadms@admin.fsu.edu>.  International Graduate students should 
send correspondence to <intladms@admin.fsu.edu>.  International 
undergraduates may use the INTL option listed below.

To access an SOS auto-reply response, you should submit a new e-mail 
message with *one* of the following topic keywords placed in the 
subject line of the message.  To access multiple responses, you must 
send a separate message for each topic keyword.  Please note:  do not 
include any additional characters in your subject line, including 
spaces.

EXAMPLE: If you want to have information about visiting the campus and 
area hotels, send one message with the topic keyword VISIT in the 
subject line.  Then, send a second message with the topic keyword 
HOTELS in the subject line.  The messages will be returned to the 
e-mail address from which you sent the message.  Again, use only one 
keyword at a time with no extra spacing.


The topic keywords for available SOS auto-reply responses are:

FSUAPP - Undergraduate brochure and application.  You will need to 
include your Social Security number, full name, complete mailing 
address, area code and phone number, as well as your high school 
graduation date (if you will be applying as a freshman) in the body 
of the e-mail.  If you have Internet access, you may prefer to use 
the online application and forms available at 
<http://admissions.fsu.edu>.

include your name and mailing address in the body of your message and 
any questions.  Most departments have information available through 
the FSU Admissions Website which you can access at 
<http://admissions.fsu.edu/aca-004.html>.  However, many departments 
do not send out printed departmental information through

access.

SOS WEBSITE INFO

If you haven't already done so, you should visit the website for the 
FSU Office of Admissions at <http://admissions.fsu.edu>.  This site 
contains *more information than all of our traditional printed 
publications combined.*  You should bookmark this address for easy 
future access to our online application for undergraduates, the 
Undergraduate Bulletin (catalog), admissions information, and links to 
other FSU information including the main FSU homepage, departmental 
homepages (found under academic majors), and e-mail contacts.  
Sometimes it is hard to locate the information you want on websites; 
we can help you by sending you an index of the FSU Admissions Website 
via the auto-reply options listed below.


SOS QUERY

The FSU Admissions staff hopes that these options will allow you to have 
the quickest possible access to the information you need to make FSU 
your school of choice.  We know that these options do not cover all of 
the possibilities, though.  If you should need assistance with any topic 
not addressed in this message or on the FSU Admissions Website at 
<http://admissions.fsu.edu>, please submit an e-mail message with the 
topic keyword of QUERY to this e-mail address 
(<admissions@admin.fsu.edu>).  

We feel that customer service is our main priority.  We will do all 
that we can to help you make an informed decision about attending FSU. 
Information about the Admissions Staff can be obtained by submitting 
the title/subject of STAFF to the Admissions e-mail address. 

Thank you for your cooperation in helping us assist you as quickly as 
possible.

I have tried to avoid contributing to this problem but it now
looks like it will go on forever if I don't inject one more
message.

The solution is NEVER SEND ANYTHING TO CSLIST@FUDAN.EDU

If you are interested in the "why" continue to read the message
I sent earlier.

I plan to send Mr. Gao a message that he and any other students
who use this time-wasting spam attack that he can forget about
receiving materials from Clemson.

>I have gotten two of these today. One from SUNY Buffalo and one
>from UCSC.  (I also got an "original" from China)
>
>As near as I can tell here is what is happening:
>Fudan has a mail distributer that Mr. Gao sends a message to
>and the distributer sends the message to EVERY CS grad program
>in the good ole USofA (maybe multiple messages!)
>
>Now if Ms. X       at SUNY or Ms. Y     at UCSC  or Dr. Westall
>at Clemson inadvertently
>sends their canned responses to cslist@fudan.edu rather than
>gyqin@fundan.edu... then their reply is reflected back to everybody
>on the original list and to make matters worse, Mr. Gao never
>sees it and so he may try again!

>I don't think we will EVER stop this Chinese spam and so it would
