It would be cheaper to buy it in kit form.

If you try to collect the parts it may wind up more expesive due to 
shipping...depending on how n\many places you gotta go to...and also, 
availability, hunting the parts down, etc.  This method is the worst.

Unless you want the exercise of building the board, you should buy the 
assembled one. Many problems arise from building the board.  Even if you 
have no problems, the time you take to build the board may be quite 
long.  It depends on your experience with soldering etc.  But if you're a 
board assembling pro, you have no need for the excercise.

Each approach has its own merits.  It depends on what you want to accomplish.

Hope this helps.
