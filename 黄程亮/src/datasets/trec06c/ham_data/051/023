I think it would be a good thing. The additional list features would be
welcome. My only concern is the terms of service. The sublicensing part gets
pretty signifigant <http://www.lugnet.com/admin/terms/>.

   7.  By posting messages, uploading files, inputting data, or engaging
       in any other form of communication through this service, you are
       granting LUGNET and its owners a perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-
       free, unrestricted, non-exclusive, worldwide license to:

       i.  Use, copy, publish, sublicense, adapt, transmit, archive,
           restore, publicly perform, or display any such communication
           in any medium, and to

       ii. Sublicense to third parties the unrestricted right to
           exercise any or all of the foregoing rights granted with
           respect to the communication.

Because of these restrictions I wouldn't feel comfortable moving the list to
a place where I occasionally discuss unique ideas that I want to keep some
semblance of ownership of.

> Dear all,

> about the possibility of hosting the handyboard@media mailing list on
> his site.
>
> We think this could be a great idea because of the burgeoning robotics
> community on LUGNET, sparked by the recent release of the LEGO RCX
> Brick.  As many of us Handy Board users use LEGO, there is likely to
> be a fair bit of overlap of interests between the two communities.
>
> In practice, hosting handyboard@media on LUGNET would mean that there
> would be a threaded web interface to reading traffic in addition to
> the regular mailing list.  Messages sent to the list would show up on
> a robotics/handy-board/ group on the LUGNET site, and messages
> originated on the web site would be transmitted to the list as emails.
>
> Thus, everyone would have the choice of either continuing to use email
> to receive the handyboard traffic, or browsing the web site to do so.

> We would get better email features like digest form and automated list
