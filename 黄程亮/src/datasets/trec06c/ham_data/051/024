Hi All

	I recentlly hacked to servo motors  for continues rotation, when i loaded 
the dual servo motor drivers up and turned on the bot it started out going 
straight for about 0.5 a sec then started vering left I ve tried on difernt 
surfaces ,  tried in software to even it out , thers nothing on the frame to 
make it go left ,( its a talrik junior frame from mekatronix) at looking at 
the left servo it was going slower, could it be the program im runing is to 
blame :
void main()
{
	servo_a7_init(1);
servo_a5_init(1);
while(1)
{
while(digital(5) == 1)
{
	servo_a7_pulse = 7000;
	 servo_a5_pulse = 1000;
}

while(digital(5) == 0 )
{
	servo_a7_pulse = 1000;
	sleep(0.9);
	servo_a5_pulse = 7000;
}
}
}

I know the servo pulses seem like it would make the bot continuesly turn but 
Mr.Robot (place got hacked servos from) did something werid to one of them , 
I give it a 7000 to go forward like its brother does and all the other 
servos i tries and it goes backwords , this is the servo I have running 
forwad all the time the problem servo is the one thats beeing reversed at a 
obstacle ,, Could all this be both servo s are fried and i should get more

any thax for you help
Alex
