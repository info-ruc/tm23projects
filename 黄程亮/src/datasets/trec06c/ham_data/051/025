To clarify point #7:  Authors of messages appearing in LUGNET discussion
groups do retain ownership and copyright of their messages, and they also
retain the right to sell or license their messages as they see fit.  LUGNET
does not own the messages that people post; it only has a non-exclusive
license to the messages so that the content can be reproduced in various
formats.  (Just like any mailing list or Usenet implicitly has, but people
don't typically think or wonder about those types of details.)

For example, every message that comes in to LUGNET is served up as a web
page in several different shapes & sizes (views).  That involves modifying
the original content slightly (suppressing quoted material or wrapping lines
to fit the browser window width in certain views, for instance).  The headers
on every incoming e-mail message are also converted from SMTP email format to
NNTP news format, since the discussion groups are based on an NNTP server at
the core.  Then they are converted back to SMTP format for people reading
long-distance via e-mail rather than directly with a real newsreader.

The purpose of #7(b) is not to rule out the possibility of, say, a CD-ROM
archive collection or other cumulative work.  If LUGNET put out a CD-ROM
directly, it would fall under #7(a), but since burning and shipping CD-ROMs
isn't probably a very fun thing to do all day, content might conceivably
need to be sublicensed to a third party for the purpose of such an archive,
hence #7(b).  #7 as a whole isn't intended for stealing ideas or not giving
credit where credit is due -- it's intended to make sure that the messages
people post will always be readable by everyone for the next 2, 5, 10, 20
or more years, in whatever formats the original messages might have to be
put into.  Yes, #7 does grant the right to sell messages that people have
posted and not pay royalties, but I can't imagine any messages ever being
sold except as a whole collection.  Like, nobody's message is going to be
sold to a magzine, or put on the back of T-shirts and sold without their
permission, etc.  All the messages are available gratis to anyone browsing
on the web, anyway.

I hope this helped shed some light on point #7.  :-)
