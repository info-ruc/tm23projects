  My guess is that you've got a really old version of DMDX, what you
describe was indeed the case quite some time ago, however I'm pretty
sure I fixed it.  If you have an up to date version then something
new is busted.

  Your other problems probably stem from using the comma operator
with digital video (I don't think I've ever tested it), in that the
attempt to start three streams simultaneously fails, try them with a
short interval (1 tick should suffice) between them and no comma.  I
never really intended that this feature be used, it just happened to
be a natural ability arising from the way I built the code.
