Hello,

I've made it up to step 6.0.5 of assembling my first handyboard.  I
purchased the unassembled components from Patrick Hui, so there may be 1 or
2 substitutes, but everything's gone smoothly so far.  All previous
assembly and testing steps have been completed successfully.

When I power the board on, the 16 blocks appear on the LCD.  They aren't
faint though, they're pretty dark.  The yellow charge LED flashes
continuously.

I power on while holding Stop to get into bootstrap mode.  The 16 dark
blocks appear on the LCD, and the charge LED doesn't flash.

I run HBDL and choose to download pcode_hb.s19.  The monitor downloads
successfully, but as soon as the code begins to download I get the
following message from HBDL: "Error at address 0x000"

I looked at the mailing list archive, and realized I had a different
version of pcode_hb.s19 (that I got with the commercial version of IC from
Newton Labs), so I downloaded pcode_hb.s19 from the HandyBoard web site.  I
still get the same problem.

So far, here's what I've done:

Rechecked pin 28 of the memory chip to make sure it is getting 5v.
Unplugged the memory chip and powered on-- the yellow charge LED doesn't
flash anymore
Checked the voltages on other pins of the memory chip-- most are at 2.6v
(not sure if this is good)
Checked my solders and everything looks ok to the naked eye.
No components feel hot when the board is powered on.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.
-Jake
