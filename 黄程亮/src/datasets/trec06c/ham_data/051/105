Short answer:
	No it is not.

Longer answer:
	Sure it's easy, connect the serial port of the handyboard to a 
	graphics terminal (a DEC VT340 would work well) and you're 
	done.

My guess is that you want to use a different LCD with the Handyboard and
the definitive answer for that is:

	The handyboard HARDWARE only supports LCDs with a 14 pin parallel
	interface and embedded LCD controllers.

	The handyboard SOFTWARE in the form of IC only supports two line
	by 16 character LCDs that use the 14 pin parallel LCD interface.

By designing new software or new hardware you can change either answer.
