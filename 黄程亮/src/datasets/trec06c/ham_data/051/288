Hi all,

I want to add some extra analogue ports and some digital ports to my
handy board. I have looked at the circuit schematics for the 
expansion board and worked out what I need to do. I don't want to
buy an expansion board as I don't need the extra servo/Polaroid
ports and would like to build it myself. my question is, can I use
a ribbon cable to attach my expansion board to the data bus or will
this cause problems due to interference and shielding.


Thanks 

Russ.
