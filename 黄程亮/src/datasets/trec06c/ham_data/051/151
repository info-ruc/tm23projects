A 486 Board + 486 + 4Meg of ram + 100 Meg drive + keyboard should cost around $20. Or free if you go dig in the right trash ;^).

I don't know where you are but around here (San Francisco Bay area) shops like Weirdstuff (http://www.weirdstuff.com) are selling used Pentium motherboard for $5. Add a Pentium 90 for $8,16Meg of ram for $20 and a 200Meg Disk drive for another $20. Total cost: around $50 bucks, give or take $10.

Price are climbing if you want a monitor/video card for it, monitors aren't cheap, even old ones.

Or just try eBay (http://www.eBay.com). You can get a complete 486 notebook for less than $100 there.

Happy shopping.
