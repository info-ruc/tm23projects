I have a Windows problem I thought people should know about.  The refresh
rate on our test machines is set to 'optimal' in Settings/Control
Panel/Display Properties/Settings/Advanced.  However, 4 times now when the
machine booted up it has mysteriously forgotten this and even worse when I
went to Settings/Control/..../Settings/Advanced the dialog box for changing
the refresh rate was no longer there.  This has happened with two different
video cards.  Rebooting solves the problem, but it would be nice to solve
it properly.  Is this some kind of registry error?  Anyone know anything
about this problem or come across it themselves?   

I've put a couple of messages on newsgroups about this, but have yet to
receive any replies.

P.S.  Thanks for the info about timing, Jonathan, you've put my mind at
rest.
