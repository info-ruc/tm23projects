Dear all,

I've been in communication with Todd Lehman, who created and runs the
LUGNET LEGO Users Group Network web site (http://www.lugnet.com/),
about the possibility of hosting the handyboard@media mailing list on
his site.

We think this could be a great idea because of the burgeoning robotics
community on LUGNET, sparked by the recent release of the LEGO RCX
Brick.  As many of us Handy Board users use LEGO, there is likely to
be a fair bit of overlap of interests between the two communities.

In practice, hosting handyboard@media on LUGNET would mean that there
would be a threaded web interface to reading traffic in addition to
the regular mailing list.  Messages sent to the list would show up on
a robotics/handy-board/ group on the LUGNET site, and messages
originated on the web site would be transmitted to the list as emails.

Thus, everyone would have the choice of either continuing to use email
to receive the handyboard traffic, or browsing the web site to do so.

We would get better email features like digest form and automated list
addition/removal; plus, our traffic would be threaded, browsable, and
archived on LUGNET.

Why don't people check out the LUGNET site, http://www.lugnet.com/,
and see what you think about this.  I'm interested to hear if people
think it would be beneficial to the Handy Board community to join up
with LUGNET.

Yours,
Fred
