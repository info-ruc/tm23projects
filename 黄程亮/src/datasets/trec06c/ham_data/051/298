This was the case for the error that I was getting.  I switched to a slower
machine and things worked after that.

Dear Jacob,

the same problem i have solved 4 days. Is solved now, but must prepare the
new files ready to send to others.

Now i can recommend.

1. There is a SW waiting loop which length is short for quicker CPU.
2. Use a Pentium till 200 MHz for downloading with the HBDL.EXE
3. Use a Pentium till 150 MHz for downloading with Charles Hacker
     HandyBoard.exe

a. I am in contact with C. Hacker from Australia and V. Gerasimov MIT to
make the solution for quicker machines clear, ready for use etc..
