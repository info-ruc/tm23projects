  This is usually associated with '9x not correctly knowing what
monitor is attached to the machine, consequently when it reboots it
goes into auto detection mode and tells the driver that there's a
different monitor out there and the the driver only provides settings
that the monitor can handle -- so being provided with the option ot
tweak refresh rates is dependant on the monitor you have (or that '9x
thinks you have) plugged into the machine.
