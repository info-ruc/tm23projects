Hi Josh - -
Any wall-wart rated at 12VDC @ 500mA with the center positive is
fine.  The serial board will accept either polaarity, but the HB
itself will not.  Do NOT use a wall wart with a higher current
rating ... the HB may not load it enough to lower the voltage to
acceptable levels.  See the FAQ.

The source of the RAM chip shouldn't matter ... so long as it is
a 62256-100LP.  I did a quick online search of Digikey, Mouser,
and Jameco ... and only found Jameco's 42833.  You might shift
some of the more common parts from Digikey/Mouser to Jameco to 
get away from the low order penalty.

I don't know how to help you on the LCD.

BTW, if you are trying to save money it might be best to buy a
parts kit from Patrick Hui at:
     http://www.RobotStoreHK.com/
Also, unless you have a LOT of experience assembling & soldering 
complex electronic devices it may well save you money in the long
run if you buy Mr. Hui's assembled HandyBoard.  The HB requires
a lot of detailed instruction following, a whole lot of very 
delicate soldering, and if you don't have access to someone with
HB troubleshooting experience you could easily lose your entire
investment.  His price is only US$190 and he has a very good
reputation.

Hope this helps,
