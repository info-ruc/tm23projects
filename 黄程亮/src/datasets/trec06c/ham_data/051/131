Only way I can figure is to talk to the Linux uC project people at:

http://ryeham.ee.ryerson.ca/uClinux/
or
http://www.moretonbay.com/coldfire/linux-coldfire.html

Though they don't have a working version for the 68HC11. The thing about
a microcontroller is that it's so different from an intel or alpha-
based microprocessor (really any straight microprocessor) that I think
they have to re-invent the wheels to do anything with it. I can't see it
being much better than the Pcode anyway, because running it would take a
lot more resources. Best to just use a Linux based computer, and tie
into that a bit more (eg. You could build a TK script to use IR for
active communications). Or get a cheap (right!) 486 Single Board
Computer (SBC) with a motor control circuit if you're really serious
about using Linux in a robot. I don't think we'll see a truely viable
Linux kernel for an 8 bit uC for a while, if we ever do.
