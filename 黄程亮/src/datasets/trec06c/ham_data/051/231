The problem could be in the power circuitry. Are the motors powered from
a separate supply ? You could try placing some capacitors between the
sensor's power connectors.

Subject: Use of GP2DO2


Hi all,
I am using two GP2DO2 on Rug Warrior. Sensors are giving me very stable
reading when motors are not running, but when motors are running the
readings start jumping around. I am running the motors but the robot is
static as I have placed it on piece of wood. While the robot is static,
the
readings from the sensors are not same for static object. Some time I
get a
difference of 50 to 100.
Can the running of motors interfere the readings from sensors. If yes
what
is the solution. If not what can be the others reasons.
Thanks

Kind Regards,
Javaid Iqbal
