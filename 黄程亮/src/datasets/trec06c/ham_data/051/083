HAS ANY ONE  EVER INTEGRATED A HANDY BOARD WITH A RADIO CONTROLLED R/C BOARD.
MEANING THAT YOU COULD HAVE A 2 IN 1 ROBOT.

MEANING:

1) IT WOULD BE AUTONOMOUS
2)ALSO IT WOULD BE RADIO CONTROLLED

WHICH WOULD BE EXCELLENT TO CHANGE FROM AUTOPILOT(AUTONOMOUS) AND MANUAL(RADIO
CONTROLLED)

IN CASE THE ROBOT EVER GOT STUCK OR GONE CRAZY

THIS IS A GENERAL QUESTION FOR YOU GUYS OUT THERE, HAS ANY ONE OUT THERE EVER
EXPERIMENTED THAT???

THANX!
