SIMPLE QUESTION TO ANYBODY:

I'M PLANNING ON INTERFACING  THE HANDY BOARD WITH AN R/C CAR. NOW THE
MOTORS OF THE R/C CAR DRAW 1 AMP CONTINUOUSLY, AND A PEAK CURRENT OF 3.5
AMPS. THE R/C CAR USES A 9.6 VOLT BATTERY.

NOW , ACCORDING TO HANDYBOARD SPECIFICATIONS, IT ALSO HAS A 9.6 VOLT
INTERNAL BATTERY, AND MOTOR DRIVERS DON'T EXCEED 1 AMP, RIGHT?

SO I REALLY DON'T HAVE TO GET ANY H BRIDGES, DO I?

NOW, WOULD IT BE ON THE SAFE SIDE TO USE THEM?
WOULDN'T BE BETTER ANYWAY IF I HAD A SEPERATE POWER SOURCE FOR THE
MOTORS SO IT WOULDN'T DRAIN THE HANDYBOARD'S BATTERY?

THIS IS A SIMPLE QUESTION, I JUST WANNA BE ON THE SAFE SIDE
