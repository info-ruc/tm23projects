My guess is that the Polaroid unit will only be able to drive
transducers with electrical characteristics very similar to the
Polaroid transducer.

The transducer functions mainly as a capacitor, and in between
pings, it is kept at a couple hundred volts DC bias (I guess
for effectively listening for an echo).

If you can get your hands on a capacitance meter, you might
test your depth finder transducer and see how close it comes to
the Polaroid specs.

Keep in mind that you should never trigger a ping on the
Polaroid unit without a transducer hooked up to it; apparently
that'll blow the circuit permanently. If you try a different
transducer with it, wear safety goggles and have a fire
extinguisher handy ;-]

Let us know the results of any smoke tests you conduct. Best of
luck!
