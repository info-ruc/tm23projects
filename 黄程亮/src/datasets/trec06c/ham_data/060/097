    I would suggest that the sensors are picking up IR.  I would wager that 
your color filters are passing the IR with little attenuation and that your 
sensors are peaked in the IR region and little affected by the visible color 
information.
    If you have access to a CCD Camcorder, and an IR LED you can play with 
the filters a little.  I think most CCD Camcorders are sensitive to IR.  Look 
at the IR LED through the camera to see if you can see it glowing.  If so, 
then place the color filter in the path to see how much the IR light is 
attenuated.
    I have recently done some experiments (color enlarger) with CdS cells and 
found that I can change their response using RGB color filters.  I believe 
they are also sensitive to IR and UV, but they are substantially influenced 
by visible light, enough to show a difference when different color filters 
are introduced.
    American Science Surplus (Jerry Co.) recently advertised some large ones 
for a good price:
