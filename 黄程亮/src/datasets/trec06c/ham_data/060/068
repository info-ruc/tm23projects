hi everyone, the mit 6.270 contest is this week.  it's open to the
public; you just show up.

the official start time is 6 pm.  that means you must get there
between 4 and 5 pm, depending on how good you'd like your seats to
be.  typically,  all the seats are gone by 5:15 pm.

it's in MIT building 26, room 100 (26-100).  here's a map:

  http://whereis.mit.edu/bin/map?locate=room_26-100

you can often find parking on massachusetts ave, vassar st, or main
st.  entering from mass ave, you'd come in through the main entrance
underneath the dome (building 7), and then walk through bldgs 3, 10,
4, and 8 before taking a left, walking down some stairs, and cutting
through bldg 16 on your way to bldg 26.

if you're coming in from vassar or main st, and walking into campus
from the outside, there's an overhang with an entrance to bldg 26
along the road that goes betw buildings 12 and 24.

i won't be there (i'm visiting lego in denmark this week), but i hope
some of you can come!  just show up early, camp out, and send one of
your crew out for pizza.

best,
fred

What:  6.270 Autonomous Robot Design Competition
When:  6:00pm on Thursday, January 27, 1999 (come early!)
Where: 26-100

The 14th Annual
6.270 Autonomous Robot Design Competition
Bots in Blue

STORY
In the not-so-distant future, the hacking tradition at MIT is alive and 
well. To enforce order and counteract the "misdeeds" of these hackers, the 
campus police have decided to use autonomous robots to keep the peace.

In their pilot program, the campus police are evaluating the performance of 
different robots by having the robots compete against each other. The 
campus police will select for mass deployment the robot that best 
eliminates the hacker threat for its assigned campus.

The mission is to design and construct an autonomous police robot (RoboCP 
for short) for the campus police to test. Each RoboCP must scour its 
assigned campus for hackers and neutralize this threat, while not harassing 
"innocent" students or professors.


WHAT IS 6.270?
6.270 ("six-two-seventy") is a hands-on, learn-by-doing robotics
course for MIT students run entirely by volunteer student
organizers. Participants in the course work in teams of two or three
and receive a kit of parts at the beginning of January from
which they must design and build an autonomous robot. Three
and a half weeks later, those sixty robots compete at the
annual 6.270 contest, one of MIT's most popular events.

The goal of the course is to provide an alternative approach
for learning advanced technological ideas.  The course aims to
draw upon the best aspects of the hacker ethic -- the idea that
people learn most effectively when they are having fun and
building things that they care about.  It's an opportunity to
design and build a system from scratch -- combining solder,
chips and elbow grease and hopefully ending with a functioning
robot.

6.270 is supported by the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science 
(EECS) Department at MIT, Compaq Computer Corp., Teradyne, Ford Foundation, 
General Motors Corp., Microsoft Corp., Guidant, Oracle Inc., Gleason 
Research, Cypress Semiconductor, IBM, LEGO Systems Inc., Polaroid Corp., 
Hawker Energy Products, and Newton Labs.
