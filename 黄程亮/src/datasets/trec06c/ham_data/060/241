Actually, I live in Wisconsin, and I heard about the "Rockets for School"
but no one in my high school knows anything about it.  I saw it on the news.
. .  Now that I am in college, and I still want to try launching something
up in the sky!  Possibly a GPS device with the HandyBoard just to do some
data collection (I haven't given any thoughts as to what I really want to do
other than to have some fun!).  Where can I find more information, Phil???

Most likely not, Max, unless I save up a lot of money and get a
daVinci organizer or something like that and write up a donwlink
program... :-)

There's this thing here in Wisconsin (And in Michigan and Iowa)
called "Rockets for Schools" It lets students launch high power rockets,
rockets with motors that need special certification because of their high
power. So I have this 5 foot tall rocket sitting above my desk that we
flew last year with a radio transmitter in it just to hear the motor fire.
this year, I want to desing a payload to analyze the flight, etc. things
like the spinrate of the vehicle, possibly acceleration, and perhaps
monitoring some other things like temperature. Just wanted to make sure
the HB was up for the job.
Just FYI, rockets for schools is a REALLY neat thing! They launch
the rocket for $50, that includes 2 days worth of fun. There are some
rocket and electronic vendors, information groups and college recruiters
there. Not to mention watching a SuperLoki launch (it's a big old sounding
rocket).....
