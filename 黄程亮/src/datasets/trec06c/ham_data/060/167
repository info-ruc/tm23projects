HI all,

I can't seem to get DMDX to run on my machine. Twice I've downloaded the 
program to my Pentium II PC and installed it and run through the setting up 
procedures. Then when I try it out on a script I know works on the uni 
computers, I get the error message:

ERROR
Create surface failed!
DDERR_GENERIC (80004005)
Generic failure.

Does anybody know anything about what this means or what I should do?

(I've attached the DMDX script I used)

Thanx,
Suan
