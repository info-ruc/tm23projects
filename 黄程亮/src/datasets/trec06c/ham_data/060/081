  No, all files written are by default not flushed every item.  Which means
that if you have a <delay> parameter you probably want to use the TimeDX /
Advanced / Task Priorities / Always Flush File Buffers option so that you
have a constant amount of activity at the end of any given item, otherwise
some items will have disk activity as windows decides that a given file's
buffer is now full and it needs to be written to disk and other items will
not.
