Hi
	Spectronix sells a relatively cheap camera/frame grabber package named the 
ramcam. you access it directly and treat it like a ram chip.
The color vision would proboly be easy to interface as a color sensor.

	And
		To you Handyboarders out there, would this be easy to interface with the 
handyboard? and possibly use it as a low level vision sensor?
