I have some documents from Joe Rush, who built the spectrograph. There is
lots of information; one item is that the collimator focal length is 116.9 
inches and the camera focal length is 120.2 in. The design slit length
is 1.0 in, so the length at the focal plane is about 1.03 in. This
magnification should be remembered when we think about image scale.
