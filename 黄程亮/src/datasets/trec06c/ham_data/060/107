I am sorry to hear about your situation, but I would like to point out
that this sort of thing is exactly why the handyboard could, I believe,
benefit from having a durable case made for it, which provides all
access to the handyboard's (and expansion board's) I/O on the outside of
case (via connectors, etc... or in the case the the LCD display, a
transparent plastic cover), and one never need come in direct contact
with the bare board again, once the handyboard has been installed into
this case.  I can only presume that there are not enough handyboards out
there yet to make such a product a viable commercial venture, but I know
I would sure appreciate something like that.
