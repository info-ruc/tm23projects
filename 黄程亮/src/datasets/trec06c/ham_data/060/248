Have a look a http://robotics.dhs.org

This is my hobby robotics site.

Currently I have a Hexwalker running with a HB.

The 12 servo's are simply controller by a PIC 16F84. This PIC is controlled
by the HB through an async interface.
This makes it lightweight on the HB, so it can do more usefull things than
moving legs :)
So no expansion board, just one digital pin on the HB !!!

The PIC software even allows for speedcontrolled leg movement, to make it
less chunky and very smooth.
The PIC code you can download from the above mentioned site for free

Have fun
Rien
