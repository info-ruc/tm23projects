hi all

i was trying to connect a uni polar stepper motor with the hb. i was using
the stepping sequence given in peter harrison page.

A   B   C   D
1   0   0   0
0   0   1   0
0   1   0   0
0   0   0   1

This sequence means that each coil will be energised one by one. and at no
time will A and B or C and D will be energised at the same time. this works
out fine since A and B are on one motor channel and C and D are on another
motr channel

  ---------      ----------
         A |   	| C
(+V)-------	 ---------- (+V)
         B |	| D
  ---------	 ----------	

when both motor channel are off current will flow from the supply through
both coils. this will consume a lot of current. when the first sequence is
applied (i.e. A is ON) the circuit will look like as below

 +V--------      ----------
         A |   	| D
(+V)-------	 ---------- (+V)
         B |	| C
  ---------	 ----------	

thus no current will flow in coil A. but coils B C and D will be on. thus
the actual sequence effectively becomes

A   B   C   D
0   1   1   1
1   1   0   1
1   0   1   1
1   1   1   0

is my analysis correct or am i missing something? 

cheers
