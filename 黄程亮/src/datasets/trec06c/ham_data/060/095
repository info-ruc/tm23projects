Hi all!

I have some troubles with my HB. I have set it up together with the
expansion board, and it worked properly and very fine. Then once,
unfortunately, the LCD, connected to the expansion board, touched one
of the five motor-power diodes, and since then, the HB is dead. The
LCD has gone, too. After this accident (and changing the LCD), I was
only able to download the pcode, but after reseting the board, LCD
shows nothing (the top row is full), and the board has synchronization
problems. It is not able to download anything. I tried almost
everything (replacing 68HC11, memory, checked the whole board,
resoldered, using dl, dlm, even icwin), but no success. It seems to me
like there is a problem with memory (board goes to bootstrap mode
easily), but I can not find the reason.

Thanks for any idea.
