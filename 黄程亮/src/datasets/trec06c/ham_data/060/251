For the problem with DigitalVox (always triggered without reason):

I formatted one computer, installed win98v2 and it worked.
On the other one it's always not working (with a sb 32 or a sb 128) 
although it worked on two with a sb16 and on another with a sb 32 (and the 
same version of win98)
On two other machines (one with a sb 64 and one with a 128) I got the 
"DirectSoundCreate failed" (although I verified directx)
Besides these numerous tests I have yet a machine where it doesn't work and 
I'd like it to work.

For the display problem:
It was apparently due to an item:
$500 <msfd 1000>"C'est reparti";$

But when I tried to replicate the bug it wasn't clear at all (but I've got 
a working script now).
