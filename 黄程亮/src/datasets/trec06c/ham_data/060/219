Since the HB battery is only 9.6 V, a 12 V motor would most
likely draw too much current and pop the circuit breaker (or
worse).

I don't see why you couldn't power the servos with a separate
12 V battery, though. The HB expansion board is all set up to
drive servos, and it's also designed to easily accomodate a
separate servo battery. There's a way to do it without the
expansion board, too, but I don't know the details. Best of
luck!
