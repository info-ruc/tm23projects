Finally my script seemed to to work with the delay in the first frame. But 
now a new thing appeared: Here I've got two machines, the two with a sb32 
and win 98 (and I installed the same new drivers from creative (but 
nevertheless it displays a different driver version and the same files 
versions )).
On one machine the script lets the stimuli until the subject gave his 
response, while on the other not (the stimulus disappears even if the mic 
is not plugged).

Would you have an idea?

Boris
