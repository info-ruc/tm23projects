Hello.. i am a beginner of using HB and i have some problem hope you can
help me.. thanks..

I have hacked a servo motor to become a DC motor (by removing all
electronic parts inside the servo) and plugged the "motor" into the
motor port. but when i use the command "fd, bk and motor", it failed..
the motor can only rotate for about 1-2 sec, then its stopped.. i don't
know why.. is the not enought current for the motor ?? i try to replace
the L293D IC with L293B.. but the result is the same.. finally i try the
by-pass the Vc (pin 8) of the L293B from the HB and applied a seperate
6V battery to L293b pin 8(+) and pin 4 (-).. then the HB and motor seem
can run smooth... but i would like to ask will this modification damage
the HB ?? please help me.. thanks !!
