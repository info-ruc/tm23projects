In 1998 I made a mobile robot that communicates with a
desktop computer using a radio module. Shortly after I
accomplished this I made a webpage showing the
results. Recently I moved to this page to another
location. I invite you all to take a look at it and if
you have any questions at all, please feel free to
write me a message.
