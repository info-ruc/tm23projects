	I had a very similar error yesterday, setting up my new Compaq ultra slim
notebook to run DMDX.  I noticed that when I ran TimeDX and selected the
Video Driver option, TimeDX came up with three or four drivers, one of
which was already highlighted.  I figured that must be the right one, but
when I tried to run DMDX, I got the DDERR_GENERIC message.

	I went back to TimeDX and selected a different driver, and then everything
was OK.

	Hope this helps.

	--Ken
