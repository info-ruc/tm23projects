  Ok, the Digital Vox is fixed in 1.1.15.  It was broken because DMDX
didn't wait for the DirectSoundCaptureBuffer to finish at the end of each
item, it would if the RecordVocal device was used in conjunction (it has
to, can't write out the data till it's recorded) but not if just the
DigitalVox was used.  And you're thinking why should it?  Because the
DirectSoundCapture stuff only just works and I designed the DigitalVox
assuming it really worked, to wit, I assumed that if you stopped a buffer
recording it's pointers would all reset and the next time you started
recording it would start filling the buffer at it's beginning.  Well it
doesn't, it starts filling where you stopped it -- which makes a lot of
sense if you are using a circular buffer and none whatsoever if using a
regular buffer like DMDX uses.  

  The upshot?  If you set a timelimit of 60000 DMDX will wait for 60000ms
when using either the RecordVocal device or the DigitalVox device is used,
like it was supposed to when I originally released it, regardless of when
the DigitalVox triggers.

  I'm looking at the code to see whether a circular buffer is feasable, I
didn't write one originally as timeout values I was anticipating were in
several second range, not the minute range and therefore waiting for the
buffer to finish was no big deal (even if I did forget to put the code in
that waited when only the DigitalVox was used).  Note, unless I include a
new option for RecordVocal, it will still always wait the full timeout
value.
