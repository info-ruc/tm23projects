  There is one thing you can do to try and remove the refused flips errors
and this is to dicker with the the timing parameters for that video mode in
TimeDX / Advanced / Vertical Retrace Sync Thread.  Essentially what is
happening is that DMDX needs to setup the flip for the next retrace to
display the next frame, however the video card is complaining that it can't
do it at that time.  In my experience it can't do it for one of two
reasons, either DMDX has waited too long to ask for the flip and because
it's a wretched video card it can't accept commands to flip when it's
within a few milliseconds of the next retrace (most video cards have no
problem with this) or it can't accept the command because it's busy
blitting data to a video buffer, but this is much less likely as DMDX in
most instances has so many video pages that it's likely to have moved
everything into video memory long before the frames are going to be needing
flipping to be displayed.
  So the first thing is to reduce the Sleeping Time, this is the amount of
time that DMDX spends doing other things besides tending to the vertical
retrace before the next retrace, so the longer this value is the closer to
the next retrace DMDX will ask for a flip.  Be careful however, reducing
this value means DMDX has less time for other tasks.  The other thing you
can do is reduce the maximum number of lines to blit at once, this will
make DMDX do less blitting in a single chunk and therefore tie the video
card up for less time at a time and therefore possibly reducing the chance
of a refused blit, but this assumes that you have a video card with little
memory or are using a video mode that uses an enormous amount of memory --
you can see how likely this is to be the cause of your problem by looking
at the diagnostics DMDX displays, at the start of running an item file
there will be a line displaying the number of video memory buffers using
the requested video mode for that item file, if there are more buffers than
you have frames in an item this is unlikely to be the cause of your trouble.
