It sounds like you might have a mechanical, rather than
electrical, problem.

Servos typically have some sort of stop nub on the gears so
that they can't rotate past a certain point. If you don't cut
off the nub with a hobby knife or saw, the motor will stall.

I've also heard of servos (small, lightweight models) that have
gears that are only half round or so. I'm guessing that's not
your problem, though.

Best of luck!
