  Hmm, thought I had it figured it out.  My calculated time for execution
of the second item file (I thought) was 21 seconds shy (actually it's 21
seconds over) so I was thinking maybe the comments were taking a default
delay (the code certainly looks like they might) so divided that by 26 (the
number of comments) times the frame duration and whoa, the magic number 48
(the value of the delay parameter) pops out of the calculator!  But alas,
the observed exection time is 21 seconds under my estimate.  All is not
lost however, it could be that the comments are somehow undermining the
scheduling, I would advise trying the S#008Scan1testA.rtf itemfile without
the comments and see if the exection time goes up 21 seconds to my
anticipated 878 seconds.
