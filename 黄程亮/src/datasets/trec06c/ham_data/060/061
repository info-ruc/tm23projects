  A a general rule it's also a good idea to use the extended parameter line
convention otherwise DMDX won't parse the line as a parameter line if word
actually puts a hard return in there:

<ep> N202 <zil> <ContinuousRun> <t 1800> <defaultwritingcolor 255255255>
<nofeedback> <defaultbackgroundcolor 0>  <defaultfont Times New Roman>
<defaultfontsize 26> <id keyboard> <d 48> <RecordClockOnTime>
<TimeCriticalFrame> <id PIO12>  <mip 27> <vm 640,480,480,16,0> </ep>

  Sorry, I can't read .xls files.  A you complaining about a one minute
variability or a one minute overall longer execution time?

  My guess is that your error might be coming from the fact that the
timeout for responses is less than the durartion of the display meaning
that the item duration will be determined by something other than the
display, for example:

=4599 <fd 30> *g"d:\Iaps\4599.bmp"/,<fd 150> g"d:\Iaps\PUN2.bmp"/;

  Here you've got a display of 150 ticks over 1800ms which means that your
refresh rate has to be over 12ms (or under 83Hz) in order for the display
to be determining the duration of the item file, an 85Hz display would
break it.  BTW,  I can't see why you've got "/,<fd 150>", it's not going to
hurt but it should be "/ <fd 150>", or at least some fd thats a good deal
bigger than the timeout.
