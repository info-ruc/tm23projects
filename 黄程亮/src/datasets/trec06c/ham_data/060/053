I was using the handy board when it ran out of power. I decided to charge the
board for 14 hours but I actually left it charging for 17 hours. Afterwards I
tried downloading the pcode_hb.s19 into the board to make sure it would work.
Unfortunately I kept on getting the time out error. I heard it was possible to
over charge the board if this is the class what do I do? I won't have to by a
new battery pack? Or is it possible that something in the board shorted?
