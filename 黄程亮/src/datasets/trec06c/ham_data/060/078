hi chuck
i tried using the photocells i got with the gleason research sensor motor
kit. i used red green and blue filter, but the values are almost same (with
a variation of 1 or 2). the variation is much more sensitive to the distance
between the sensor and the surface. what am i doing wrong?

you also mentioned optical sensor. is that the same as the photocell?

cheers
