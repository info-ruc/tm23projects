I need to attach an underwater sonar ranger to the handyboard but I cannot
figure out how.  Does anyone have any experience with this?  One question that
I have is if sonar transducers other than the polaroid 7000 unit can be
attached to Polaroids driver IC?  If this is the case, then can I attach the
polaroid circuit to the handyboard and a standard boat transducer to the
polaroid circuit?

Any help is desperately needed.  Thanks
