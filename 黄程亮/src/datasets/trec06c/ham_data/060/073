Hi all,

I am having a problem with the ceramic resonator for the Miniboard and I hope
someone out theer may help.

In the MiniBoard part list the ceramic resonator is listed as DigiKey part #
PX800.  However, that is an incomplete part number that corresponds to 6
different products, all of which, it seems, are surface mountable only. Does
anyone know the complete part number for a ceramic resonator that can be mounted
on the PCB board? Either Digi-Key or other large mail-/web order house (Mauser,
etc.) would do.


Many thanks in advance,
