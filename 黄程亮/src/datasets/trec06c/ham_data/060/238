Maxim sells a chip that I have connected to the parallel port on my PC and it seems to work well. I got the design from an article in Dr. Dobbs. The article was on using Linux to collect data. The author of the article has a book which has the circuit diagrams for the Maxim 186 and other ADC chips. The book also includes C source code. I compiled the source using djgpp. The book is Programming the Parallel Port; Interfacing the PC for Data Acquisition and Process Control

Also, check out http://www.controleverything.com . They sell some chips the connect to the serial port that do AtoD. I recently purchased their anabug chip that has 4 analog lnes and one digital line. I have not built the circuit yet, and they are no longer selling the chip, but they do sell others.
