For digital values, you can use a parallel port card, or even
handshake lines on a serial port.

For analog, you can again use a parallel port, and hook up an external
A/D chip.  As long as you're not trying to get too many bits of
resolution this method works well (like say 8-bits).  There are a lot
of chips out there that have many input pins for A/D.  You select
ahead of time which input you want to take a sample on.

You might also try looking in Nuts and Volts magazine for cheap
PCI/ISA cards.  That's a reasonably good place to find such things.
