  Didn't see the attachment, dunno that it would survive going through the
listserver in anyway.  As for your problem, it's not likely to be a
scripting error unless you are trying to use some unusual video mode, it's
more likely to be a limitation in the video hardware on your machine.  It's
unusual to find a machine that TimeDX runs on and that DMDX fails on, but
not impossible.  Usually the problem centers around one of two things,
either the video card doesn't have enough memory (as IIRC TimeDX doesn't
ever setup multiple "flippable" pages of video memory like DMDX does) but
there's usually an error that specifically indicates this or the drivers
for your video card just aren't up to snuff and just plain can't do what
DMDX wants to do which sounds like the problem you are experiencing in
which case getting an updated DirectX or video card driver should solve
your problem.  Could be that the hardware in your machine is just too
antiquated and no amount of new software is going to fix it in which case
you'll have to get a new video card.  Could be that your script calls for a
16bit or 32bit video mode that through some miracle TimeDX can display but
when DMDX goes to do it's thing the card doesn't support it.
