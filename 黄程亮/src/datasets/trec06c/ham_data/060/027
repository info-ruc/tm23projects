i recently purchased a handy board, an expansion
board, and a polaroid 6500 sonar sensor. i installed
the expansion board, along with the appropriate
libraries. i also plugged the sonar into the expansion
board, and used the code for the sonar on the mit
handy board/sonar page
(http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/son=
ar.html).
however, when i run the program, i receive numbers
which i am not sure i understand. after i convert the
numbers returned from the sonar to approximate
distances (feet), i get sequences such as:
1.7
-2.4
5.2
.5
-6.1

i don't understand the negative numbers. or the
sequences.=20

would this be related to the note on the website about
the installing a 0.1 =B5F capacitor in the C7 position?
if so, how does one do that?

any help appreciated,

nat
