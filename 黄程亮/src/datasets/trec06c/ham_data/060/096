I posted to this yesterday, but my reply seems to have not appeared.
What you need to have, is four sensors, not three. The fourth has no filter,
and measures 'ambient' light. You then need to compare the return from this,
to the other three sensors. You will have to amplify the signals from the
three 'filtered' sensors, since they will be proportionately 'less'. So when
the light level changes because of distance, this compensation factor changes
with this, and you are looking at the relative returns for each colour.

Best Wishes
