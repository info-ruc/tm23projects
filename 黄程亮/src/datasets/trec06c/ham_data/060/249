Personally I use a Scott Edwards Serial Servo Controller (model 1, there is
a new one out now) - SSC.
On the handyboard web site is a program to control this serial device from
the handyboard, which means you can just set each leg position and let the
other board do the work. CUts down on processing time and hassles. I use 2
of them daisy-chained together to control 12 servos for my hexapod walker
check out http://www.wantree.com.au/~oli for more info if u like..

hope this helps
Adam
