Hi Mike:
     May I obtain also the code that you mentioned? I'm supposing the code
was used at the HandyBoard?

Thanks in advance for your help...

Bill

I have code in QuickBasic and C, would this be any good to you?? It was
code
that I used at Uni and both versions have been tested on real apps so I
know
they work. For example, I developed a pneumatic cyclinder controller based
on
the QB version. Let me know if you want either version.

What is IC?
