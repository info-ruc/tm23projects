 I would imagine that this is the case since Fred states on his page that=
 it
won't work without it on most versions of the driver board.

The easiest way to do it is just desolder the two pads that align with th=
e
c7 position on the HB.  Stick a small electrolytic in there, get the
polarity correct!  (it's marked on the board with a + I believe).  and
resolder the cap in place.  It's quite easy, but let me know if you have =
any
problems.

I can't say for certain that this is why this is happening since I've nev=
er
hooked it up without the cap, but I'd think it's likely.

Good luck,
