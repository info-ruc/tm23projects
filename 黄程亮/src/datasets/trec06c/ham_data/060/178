  Depends what your item file looks like.  Other than that in almost all
cases (in other words I can't recall an instance where this has not been
the case) you are not in fact running the same item file.  Ken came in the
other day complaining about much the same thing and that there was no
chance that they were in fact not running the same item file and were
getting different behaviour on different machines but when all was said and
done he was in fact using different copies of the item file.
