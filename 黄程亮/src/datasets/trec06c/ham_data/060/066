  Oh, I recall now, sometimes it runs for 681 and sometimes for 752, right?
 If anyone else cares to think about this here are the first few lines of
his item file:

  Hmm, I see you've not setup a default frame duration on the parameter
line, although you appear to set the frame duration explicitely on
everything except the erase frames at the end of the items, which shouldn't
matter, the duration of the last frame doesn't count (as frame duration
only affects a following frame if there are no more frames that frame just
stays on the screen and DMDX ends the item, unless of course it's waiting
for a response) however having a default frame duration of zero could be
affecting that.  I wouldn't think your somewhat unusual "/," combo would be
doing it either, but it certainly doesn't hurt to change it to just a "/".

  You might want to check that the frame duration of your 640x480x16bpp
video mode does in fact not vary, it's faintly possible that in between
uses of the machine the monitor type changes (on account of it not being
setup right so win32 is constantly trying to set it up) and therefore the
refesh rate with it.  You could check that the monitor description does in
fact not change as well, display properties (right click on desktop) /
settings / advanced / monitor.

  I take it you've checked the outputfiles for display errors?  Using the
zillion mode means that the output is flushed to disk every item and this
takes time, if you have a less than excellent file system this can take
longer than perhaps your <delay 48> allows for, but I'd be surprised,
that's a good amount of time.
