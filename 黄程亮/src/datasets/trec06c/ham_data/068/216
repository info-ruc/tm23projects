For our current experiment I need only two buttons and I am looking
for appropriate joystick.
It seems as if I am only finding digital joysticks/gamepads
on the market.  We have such gamepad, and can only poll
every 3 milliseconds on it.  If someone has worked with a
digital gamepad, and shorted out the potentiometers to allow
1 millisecond polling, I'd be grateful for specific details
on how you accomplished it.

Thank you!
