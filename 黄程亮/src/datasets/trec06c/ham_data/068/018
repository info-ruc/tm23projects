Re: Student Packets


Time for Summer Term student packet preparations! First thing to do is fax 
(485-6253) or email (Copy-Shop@worldnet.att.net) JUST your bibliography to 
The Copy Shop so we can get your copyright clearances completed. Since Summer 
Term is scheduled differently than the others, we will work with you to get 
the packets set up to suit your students needs. Please hurry, so we can get 
started and have them ready by beginning of term.
 
Let me know if I can help in any way, or call the Copy Shop directly at 
485-6253. 

Thank you, we look forward to serving you again this summer.
