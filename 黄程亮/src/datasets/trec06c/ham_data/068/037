I built my own Handyboard-ish computer (the Gadget Board) for my robot (Gadget).
My motivation for building it was several-fold: First I just wanted to see if I
could do it. It was a lot of fun (not to mention hard work). Two, I wanted to do
more things than the Handyboard was really designed to do. Three, at one time I
toyed with the idea of selling boards (soon shelved when I realized there were
more profitable things to do :) Four, it was fun (I know I already mentioned
that, but it was so fun, I had to say it twice :)

Was it worth the effort?? You betcha! I've been an electronics/computer
professional for close to 20 years and I still learned lots of new things.

The above notwithstanding, pretty much the largest motivator was needing a board
to do more than the HB was designed to do. I poured over the schematics for the
HB at quite some length, making notes and lots and lots of trial-circuit designs
on paper napkins before I decided that trying to "expand" the HB was more trouble
than it was worth. Still, I really like the development environment, the active
mailing list (I've been on the HB list since the 6.270 Robot Builder's Guide came
out-- when was that Fred, 1993 or so??? This is one of the best lists I've ever
seen), lots of documentation and support, and programming examples and
contributed code. With resources like that, I'd have been foolish to do consider
anything else! So I pulled out the HB "core" and basic features that absolutely
made it a "HB" and interwove my circuits into the design. The result is a board
that is pretty much 100% HB compatible (ok, maybe not absolutely 100% but pretty
darned close- it runs the HB pcode unmodified) and allows me to use all the
available tools and resources to develop software with.

The new features include (doing all this from memory) 36 analog input ( 32 are
bank-switched, 4 are raw inputs), 24 (plus a few odd bits) digital I/O, a sonar
interface (pic-based), a stepper motor interface, onboard 40kHz clock source
(really useful), etc.

About two days worth of hand-design convinced me to go out and get a pcb-cad
program. It took me about a week or so to actually design the electronics and
another couple of weeks to lay out the board. Then I shopped around for a circuit
manufacturer. I ultimately decided on Canadian Circuits. They did a prototype run
(two boards) for about $300 bucks plus shipping. They required gerber plots and a
drill size guide. That was one of the more difficult aspects btw, making sure
that all my component holes were right- in the end several were right on the
"hairy-edge" and just barely worked. Even working with Canadian Circuits it took
several tries to get everything right.

Next, the moment I was waiting for arrived- about two weeks later the boards
arrived from Canadian Circuits and I pulled them out and marvelled between my
napkin drawing and the board (no matter how non-chalantly anyone tries to act-
that's definately an exciting moment). Then of course the resulting
disappointment that ensued when it didn't power up on the first try (they rarely
ever do). So a little bit of troubleshooting and a few hacked traces later it
powered up and ran perfectly.

All in all, the whole thing probably cost about two HB's worth. But then, I got
two GadgetBoards out of the deal too. This is of course _not_ inclusive of my
time and energy. Adding those factors in and the total cost would of course be
much higher. But hey, this is a _hobby_ :)

If you want to check out my designs and efforts- look at my page at
http://www.wizard.org. I haven't updated the page in awhile and everything I have
in electronic form _is_ on the page.

My two cents worth.
