Greetings,

I've looked, but don't seem to be able to find any relevant info.

How does one hook up one of these beasts to the handyboard? I remember
reading something somewhere that a track needs to be cut to do this -
something I would like to avoid if possible. Is there any way around this?

thanks
Adam
