   True, however for every feature you add to a program you decrease it's 
stability.  DMDX is currently very stable (like rock, I've never heard of 
it crashing) so I have been pretty lenient in adding new features, this 
does not mean however that I'm about to add features just for the hell of 
it.  I was considering adding variables a few weeks ago however there was 
no demand for them from anyone here (I even tried to solicit people but 
they could care less), as soon as someone wants to do an experiment that 
needs them I'll add them.  Till then I'm working on version 2 of the code 
so am not about to go adding new features (unless they are trivial) at the 
current time.
