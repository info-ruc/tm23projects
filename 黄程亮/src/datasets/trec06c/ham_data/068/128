Do you mean that when you turn on the Handy Board, the motors start to ru=
n spontaneously?  I used to have that problem, too, but only when there w=
as no program yet loaded.

I saw a message on this mailing list a few months back that suggested a r=
emedy for this problem, but I can't remember the specifics.  I think it h=
ad something to do with installing capacitors in the motor drive circuit.=
  Try searching the archives.  Sorry I can't be more help.  Best of luck!
