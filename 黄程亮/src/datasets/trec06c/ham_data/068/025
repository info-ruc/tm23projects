Hey all --

I was wrong about the speed of sound.

The mistake I made was forgetting that the sonar measures round trip time, so the
constant I experimentally determined for use in my code actually represents *two*
centimeters per 143 clock ticks (instead of one cm per 143 ticks as I had said earlier).

If the clock ticks at 2 MHz (as I believe it does, using an 8 MHz oscillator), this equates to 626 mph, which is fairly close to the nominal speed of sound.

Regardless of my error, the maximum range (corresponding to 32767 ticks) is still about 2.29 meters by my calculation.

I think the register maxes out at 32767.  Since it's a 2 MHz processor, this gives:

	(32767 cycles) / (2,000,000 cycles/second) = 0.01638 seconds

Up here in the Rocky Mountains, the speed of sound is about one centimeter every 143 half-microseconds, so the maximum range is 2.29 meters.
