Ray,

Whoops, just read my message again, and realised I had stated STEPPER 
motor, and not the intended SERVO motor.

I have used the HB to control 4 SERVO motors.  The SERVO's had an
external 5V power.  The GND of the SERVO supply was attached to the 
GND of the HB.  The Motor outputs were then capable of driving the 
SERVO motor inputs (with a square wave).
With a bit of programming (machine code) I was able to continually 
send a PWM signal (Square wave) to each of the motor outputs and keep 
all SERVO's under control.

By the way, it is also possible to use the HB motor outputs to 
control 4 STEPPER motors (yes I mean STEPPER this time).
However, you will need to use STEPPER motor driver chips.
I am currently developing a robot vehicle that has 4 stepper motors.  
The motors are actually controlled by a chip, the MC3479, stepper 
motor controller chip.
The HB outputs only need to supply a clock input to the chip, to get 
the STEPPER to turn.
(The chip also needs a direction signal, which I am setting 2 by 
Hard wiring and 2 others by the digital output lines).
