Hi guys,
I have been trying to use 600x480(16bpp) video mode and my settings have 
been saved satisfactorily in Timedx but when i run the rtf file for 
displaying my BMP images after having completed the trial it reports that 5 
display memories have been made in Direct draw using 8bpp color format.
How can I make my settings effective?
