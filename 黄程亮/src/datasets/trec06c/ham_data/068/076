Norberto:

Thanks much for the note on buildings.  Sorry to be a pest but I have some
questions.  We are trying to revise our schedule and need some more
information.

1)  Is the 30 days contingency *our contingency* or the contractor's
contingency?  We estimated in Malargue based on the completion of the
Malargue visitors center that we needed to add 60 days to the four months
originally given by the contractor.  Do we have to add the sixty days to
the 150 days instead?  Having the finish date fall after Christmas will
probably add another delay of several weeks.

2)  Is there some way to negotiate with the contractor to focus on the Los
Leones building rather than the assembly building so that we assure access
to the FD building before the end of the year?

3)  Do we still have to pay extra for temporary power to the Los Leones
site?  The contractor may delay until he has power on Los Leones before he
begins.

We really appreciate your hard work on these contracts.  It a difficult
job.
