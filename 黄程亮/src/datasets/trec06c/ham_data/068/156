Dear List Members,

I am trying to figure out how to set up an .rtf file for a word-by-word self-paced
moving window experiment. Here is a fragment of the file:

N830 <azk> f30 <cr><wfbo><t 9000> <id "propad 6"> <mr +button 3> <mpr +button 5>
<mnr +button 4><vm 800 600 600 8 0>
...
53 "=== === === ======== == === ======."<ms% 1000>;
+54 "The === === ======== == === ====== ."*;
+55 "=== car === ======== == === ======."*;
+56 "=== === was ========  == === ======."*;
+56 "=== === === returned == === ======."*;
+57 "=== === === ======== by === ======."*;
+58 "=== === === ======== == the ====== ."*;
+59 "=== === === ======== == === driver."*;
+60 "Was the car back in its place?"*;
800 <ms% 1000>/;

Since it is set up as <cr> <ContinuousRun>, I had to insert an empty frame between
53 and 54 to give subjects a pause before the first word appears on the screen. I
also tried to slow down the running of the file by putting another empty frame
after the comprehension question before the next item.  However, it is still too
fast; instead, I would like to be able to switch to a ResponseContingent mode here
and let subjects choose when to call the next item on the screen.

In the DMDX documentation though it says
"ResponseContigensy is an ancient kludge... and its use ... is strongly advised
against."

My question is whether there is a way of switching from the default <cr> mode to
something else after the presentation of the question and before the next item that
would allow subjects to control the speed of the experiment.
