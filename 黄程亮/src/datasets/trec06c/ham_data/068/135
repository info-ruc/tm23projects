Todd,

There are Two options on the Windows program HBDL.EXE

1.  Download  -  This downloads a bootloader then a file to the 
external RAM of the handy board.

2.  Burn -  This (attempts) to download a file to the HandyBoards 
68Hc11 internal EEPROM.  Thus 'BURN' the Eprom.

So DOWNLOAD is what you would use, if you are requiring to use 
Interactive C, HB-Buffalo monitor program, or some other Handy Board 
operating system.

It is most unlikely that you will ever need to use BURN.  However, it 
is there if you ever wish to write a (almost) permanent program that 
is Burnt to the Handyboard EEPROM.
