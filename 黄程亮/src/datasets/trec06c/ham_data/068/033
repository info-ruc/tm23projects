That's what I was thinking too. But there is another consideration: the 6809 
is a different class of processor than the 68HC11. The HC11 is a microcontroller 
while the 6809 is more of a general puropose microcomputer CPU. Although either
could certainly be used to control robots, the HC11 is already designed with 
interfacing to machinery in mind, for example it has ADC onboard. There are 
likely also some power consumption issues to consider. The 6809 was the core 
processor for several microcomputers like the radio shack color computer. It 
would be a good experience to work with either or both, but if ou choose a
general purpose CPU you need to provide more interface circuitry (for example
adding ADC circuits). If you have robotics in mind you might  want to take a
look at these:
