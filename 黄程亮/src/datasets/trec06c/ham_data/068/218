   Apparently a some of the things called digital joysticks have a lovely 
digital component to actually read the sticks position but they still have 
the same grim RC network interface to maintain compatibility with old 
joysticks, others are just gamepads apparently.  If you have one of these I 
recommend using the RawJoystick device (assuming you are using '95 or '98) 
instead of Joystick as this will just poll the buttons using a crude hack 
in DMDX.  Some of the later MS joysticks use the MIDI port and these (along 
with USB devices) are reportedly very fast (and you couldn't use 
RawJoystick to read them either).
