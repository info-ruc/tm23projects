Just got my handyboard, and I am new to programming, so I have a
probably simple question for you all.  I have been playing around with
IC trying to get responses on the LCD from start button presses.  if I
send the following on the IC command line :
{if (start_button()) printf("you pressed the start button\n");}
It will work only if I am holding the start button when I press return
and it sends the code to the HB.  What I want to know is how do I get it
to react to a button press.  What I was hoping for was to send the code
then have the HB wait for me to press the button to execute the printf.

Thanks,
Todd
