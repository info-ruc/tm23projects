Dear Paul,

I have been in Mendoza in order to make the last arrangements with
Ruperto MAGNI S.A. and they were:

1) The official start date of the Los Leones and the Assembly buildings
is May 24th 

2) The buildings have to be finished in 150 calendar days (it was
included 30 day as contingency).

3) This week I have to get the work's schedule ready.

I also made the last arrangements with BROMBERG S.A. and they were:

1) The official start date for the medium voltage power line is May24.

2) The line has to be finished in 45 days (5 Contingency days included).

Best regards,

               Norberto
