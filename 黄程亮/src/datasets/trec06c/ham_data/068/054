Follow this link for data about the GP2D12.  At the bottom, there is another
link for Handy Board interfacing information.

You have to cut a trace because the analog inputs on the Handy Board are
connected to pullup resistors.  The GP2D12 won't work looking into a port
that is not floating.  But cutting a trace is simple, and it's easy to put
back the way it was later if you want to for some reason.  The interfacing
link above tells you how to cut the trace.

Good luck!
