Vic,

Lots of programs handel Gerber files.  They are the standard for 
print / storage of PCB board files.

If you don't have such a program, then download one form the numerous 
freeware/shareware sites.
Most electrical type programs would give this capability.

If you don't find a freeware/shareware program, then try the demos for 
some commercial programs.
i.e.
MicroSim, PSpice - the PCBBoards package
MicroCap 5 - mix mode simulator
Ivex  - WinBoard , (also includes a separate Gerbtool program)
etc.
(Try searching the web for the above names).
