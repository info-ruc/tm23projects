   A post to the developers list that I follow indicates that a Saitek 
digital joystick no longer uses conventional analog RC timing to signal the 
PC, while it does use the conventional joystick connector it sends digital 
signals through them (with it's own custom driver of course).  I do not 
have one to test but if someone wants to try another stick it sounds like a 
good one to try.

Every program has two purposes -- one for which it was written and
another for which it wasn't.
