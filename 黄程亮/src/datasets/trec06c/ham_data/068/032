Vic,

Depends on if you want to be done this year or not.  If time and money are no
object, designing and building your own board from scratch would be exciting
and after just a few interations you could probably have one that is
reliable.  By the time you got done with it, it wouldn't cost more than two or
three times the price of buying an unpopulated PCB for the Handy Board and all
it's components.

But on the other hand, if you are interested in building a robot or some other
kind of machine with a microcontroller for its brains, then just buy a
controller and get with it.  The microcontroller is a component when used in
machinery, just like motors are.  You buy a particular motor because it is
sized right for the application, and you pick a microcontroller using the same
type of criteria.  Is it easy to program, are there programming tools
available, does it have enough I/O, is it fast enough, does it have enough
memory, is there good support for it in case you get stuck?.... those are the
questions.  You wouldn't try to make the motors yourself, would you?

However, if you are just into designing and building circuits, there are lots
of other people who do that.  A good place for you to go in that case is
http://www.seattlerobotics.org/.  Several people who design and build
microcontroller boards live over there.

Good luck,
