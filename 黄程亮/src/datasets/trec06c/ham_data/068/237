Subject: HB Memory map
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

This probably sounds like a pretty lame question but I am trying to make

use of the unused areas in the lower 32K of the memory map of the HB but

I can't seem to find the memory map in the documentation that I have
available (the HB pdf manual, IC reference, etc.). I haven't checked the

web site as we don't have web access at work due to security
limitations. Could somebody provide me with the memory map ?, it would
help alot.

Thanks in advance for your help.

John Hatton
