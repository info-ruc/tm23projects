   I've stuck a preliminary version of TimeDX 2 (in DMDX2.ZIP) on the 
website.  I have released this early code so that I can get some results 
from people regarding the millisecond callback latency analysis code 
contained in the new version of TimeDX.  The new version is not a 
replacement for the old code yet, keep it separate (registry keys from each 
version are separate so no worry there).  What the new version does contain 
is three new tests that monitor millisecond callback latencies, one in the 
original millisecond timer test that does not have DirectX active, the 
second in the advanced Video and Millisecond timer test and the last is an 
option in the Vertical Retrace Synch test (check the "Use Millisecond 
Callback Too" checkbox).  What I find is considerable variability in 
performance of from one machine to the next, in fact there appear to be two 
distinct classes of machine, the good and the average.  The good machine 
has a stand deviation of 0.31ms in the first test, and 0.52ms in the next 
two, the average machines have figures like 0.91ms, 0.72ms and 0.81ms 
across the tests -- these results are fairly consistent across wildly 
differing machine configurations.  One machine (my development box) even 
momentarily jumped from the average bracket into the very good bracket 
yesterday (SDs of 0.20ms and 0.30ms) when I installed a tape drive but then 
fell back again when I accidently damaged it a little by resetting the 
machine when I didn't mean to.  There are more details in the help file.
   I would like to see some figures from other people and if someone has 
way too much time on their hands perhaps they could try altering the 
machines performance (like ripping out extraneous hardware like NICs and 
un-installing the network layer of win32) to see if we can find out what 
brings about really good performance -- not that the average boxes don't 
run DMDX well, they do, it's just that the good boxes are better and I'd 
like to know why.
