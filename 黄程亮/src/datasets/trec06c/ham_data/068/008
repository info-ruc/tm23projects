Hello,

Reading the discussion on servos recently, I thought I'd share this info
with you.  I have advised a few student group projects involving servos and
the XB and came to the conclusion that the XB cannot handle more than two or
so servos.  The servos tend to not work properly in these cases.  I'm not
sure if this is because  they did not use an external power supply or what.
(I have not experiences with external servo power so if anyone can
interject, please enlighten.)  Though, I imagine that if the servos draw too
much power, it would reset the board and then NOTHING would work.  However,
this is not case...and the diodes don't get hot, either.  Note: the docs say
that you need an external servo power supply when the voltage drop diodes
get too hot to touch.
