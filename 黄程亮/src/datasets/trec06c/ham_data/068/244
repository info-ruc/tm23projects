Hi all,
	I have a problem with the motors connected to my handyboard. When I first
turn on the HB, the motors will spin randomly. This happens about every 2-3
times I switch on. I know this problem has come up before on the list, but
the post I found didn't answer all my questions.
What type of caps should I use, non-polarised?
Also what value capacitance should they have? (My motors are 12v [running
from HB 9.6v] and draw about 100ma each [2 motors])
The post also mentioned connecting the cap lead that goes to the negative on
the motor to the case of the motor, however my robot is differential drive
so the +ve and -ve of the motor change depending on which way the robots
going, what should I do?
	Thanks,
		Matt
