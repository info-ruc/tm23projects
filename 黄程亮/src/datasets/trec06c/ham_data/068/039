Has anyone used the Hamamatsu C3704 Drive Circuit and the R2868 Flame Detector
with the handyboard? The detector works great on my scope but I can't get the
Handyboard to read it on a digital in port. Do you have to add a capacitor to
lengthen the pulse width and if so what value capacitor. Also do you have to
cut the trace to the 47k ohm resistor.
Thank You
John Edwards
