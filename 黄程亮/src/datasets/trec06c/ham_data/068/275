Dear j.c.f,
I am trying to set up a target/distractor discrimination
task which involves the display of some colored bmp file
in a certain (and variable) display time followed by a
question asking target's presence or absence from the
subject.
I do not wish to measure RT directly but the display time
and the subject's error rate will later determine it for
me. My problem is that I can't get the dmdx to report to
in the azk file as to which button the subject has chosen
to push after having seen the impage.
How can I manipulate the output file in this way?
sincerely yours,
Bahador Bahrami


My item file is :
N16 <s 8> <azk> <cr> <nfb> f38 <t 2000> <id "keyboard"> <dbc 0> <mnr +left 
shift> <mpr +right shift> <dwc 000255000> <vm 640 480 480 16 0>
$
0 "Press SPACEBAR to start";
$
+1 <bmp>  "target" /  <ms% 1000>/<clockon>;
$
0 "the end. Thank you" ;
