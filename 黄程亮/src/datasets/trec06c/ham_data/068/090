I'm still at my servo question :)

the 3 servo routines so far use "normal" digital outputs. There are,
according to the FAQ, 4 extra outputs I could use (SPI J6). Does this mean
that I could write my own routines to drive 4 extra servos using these
ports, to a total of 6 servos (7 if you include the speaker one ) ?

Is there any information on how you should drive a servo (using ASM, from
the handyboard)
