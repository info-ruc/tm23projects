I have been playing around with my handy in command line for a little
while now.  It seems like the only way I can get it to start doing
something when a sensor is activated is to have it in an infinite loop
waiting for that sensor to be pressed.  For example:  I want it to print
something to the LCD when a button is pressed.  I use a line like this:
while(!digital(7)); printf...   while this gets the desired result, the
heartbeat gets very slow while it is executing the infinite loop.  It
seems like this means that all the processing power is being bogged down
processing the infinite loop.  What I am hoping to accomplish is to have
the Handy control a game.  What I want to happen is to have the start
button pressed, then have the handy read some sensors and react based on
what it finds.    Is the infinite loop the only way to respond to sensor
input?  I was hoping to be able to use an if control statement without
an infinite loop.  i.e.:  if(digital(7)) {do something}; but obviously
this doesn't work.  If anyone could let me know how they code for sensor
inputs I would greatly appreciate it.
