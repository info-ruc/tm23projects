A friend told me he has a development system for the motorola 6809 and he
could give it to me. I guess this would be good, I would be able to make my
custom boards. But, how does the 6809 compare to the 6811 or other
microcontrollers (Basic Stamp, PIC) and where can I still buy it (has it
beed discontinued) ?
Am I better off making a custom board with a 6809 or buying a handyboard?
