The base Handy Board is designed to control 4 DC motors.

The DC motor output ports CAN be used to control 4 (four) stepper 
motors.  Remember that a stepper motor needs a square wave pulse 
continually sent to the motor for operation, and the mark / space 
(time high / time low) pulse determines the position.
So by writing code for the motor outputs, you can control 4 (four) 
stepper motors, (but YOU need to entire the code to do this).

The expansion board has outputs to control servo's directly, but not 
having the expansion, I do not know about it.
