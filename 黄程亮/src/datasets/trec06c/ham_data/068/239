I need gamepad which is capable of polling no more then 1 ms on buttons
(simple yes/no).
I've just bought gamepad "propad 8" that can be connected over game port
as well as USB port. I had some problems with installing it on USB and
finally conected it over game port. The Input Test indicated as follows:

Device is pooled 0.055, timebase 1 ms.

It seems to me that it is pretty fast, and that gamepad is capable to
poll no more then 1 ms, over game port. I would like to hear your
opinion.
