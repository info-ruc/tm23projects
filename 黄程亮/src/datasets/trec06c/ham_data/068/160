I was trying to build a 110V AC -> 24V DC power supply
from Radio Shack parts once... It was late at night and I
was tired. I only had a 12v transformer, so I pulled out
an electronics book and build a voltage doubler on the
output side of the 12v transformer. Well I was stupid and
put on 16 volt caps... I turned it on, and crawled in front
of it around to use my voltmeter on the output, it showed
25.2 volts (actual 12.6 volt transformer - to be expected)
and I was real happy until both caps on my voltage doubler
board simultaneously exploded where I had been 5 seconds
earlier and practically shrapeneled me with capacitor pieces.
I was NOT happy...
