   I don't know the details of what exactly constitutes a digital joystick 
(for all I know it could just be marketing BS) but I would imagine that if 
you got a USB device it's polling time through DirectDraw would be 
negligible, in fact it will look more like a mouse to the system than 
anything else (ie an interrupt driven device, not a polled device like the 
original analog joysticks are).  Speaking of mice you could use a mouse as 
well, they all have very nice timing considerations and there's nothing to 
stop you plugging in two of them.

Every program has two purposes -- one for which it was written and
