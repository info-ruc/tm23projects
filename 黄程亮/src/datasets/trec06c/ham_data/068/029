Hi. I'd like to make my own handyboard if I can find all the parts in my
city. But I have a problem with making the PCB... I have a friend who has a
plotter and could draw it, but the layout files are GIFs and he uses Autocad
(old computer, old autocad)

now, the layout  files ar also in gerber format. what is this format? is
there a way to conver them in an old autocad format, or to find some
freeware layout program that reads it? there's no way I'm drawing that by
hand...
