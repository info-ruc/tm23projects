Here is a version that seemed to work OK for me.  Note that I have taken 
<cr> out of the parameter line, and I include it in the item only when I 
want it to go onto the next item without waiting for a request.

N830 f30 <wfbo><t 9000> d0
0 "=== === === ======== == === ======.";
+54 "The === === ======== == === ====== ."* <cr>;
+55 "=== car === ======== == === ======."* <cr>;
+56 "=== === was ======== == === ======."* <cr>;
+56 "=== === === returned == === ======."* <cr>;
+57 "=== === === ======== by === ======."* <cr>;
+58 "=== === === ======== == the ====== ."* <cr>;
+59 "=== === === ======== == === driver."* <cr>;
+60 %10/"Was the car back in its place?"* ;

0 "=== === === ======== == === ======.";
+54 "The === === ======== == === ====== ."* <cr>;
+55 "=== car === ======== == === ======."* <cr>;
+56 "=== === was ======== == === ======."* <cr>;
+56 "=== === === returned == === ======."* <cr>;
+57 "=== === === ======== by === ======."* <cr>;
+58 "=== === === ======== == the ====== ."* <cr>;
+59 "=== === === ======== == === driver."* <cr>;
+60 %10/"Was the car back in its place?"* ;

         The first display is an instruction only (itemno zero), and the 
subject presses the request key to get the first word.  The "d0" on the 
parameter line means that the next item is displayed as quickly as possible 
after the response.  The %10 at the beginning of the question introduces a 
variable delay between the response to "driver" and the display of the 
question.  You can make that delay whatever you want by changing the 
value.   After this response, the instruction is displayed, and a request 
is required before the first word is presented.  I have removed details of 
your input device, which of course, you should put back in.   Thus your 
parameter line should read:

>N830 <azk> f30 d0 <wfbo><t 9000> <id "propad 6"> <mr +button 3> <mpr 
>+button 5>
><mnr +button 4><vm 800 600 600 8 0>


         I hope this helps.

         --Ken Forster
