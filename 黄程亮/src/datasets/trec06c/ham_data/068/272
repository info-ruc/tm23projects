As far as your institution is under my command or jurisdiction promote them to

Be happy with creating 30 percent of all inventions if this system gets fair if

idea or two.  I am writing to establish what I hope and fervently pray is an on

I have a question regarding the mandatory swimming test that all freshmen at MI

 for me to do something else in place of the swimming test, such as take a few
extra physical education classes or do some work for the university during the
summer break? That way I could help the university and not have to humiliate my
self in front of a large group of people.

If not, is it possible to transfer over in the sophomore year and not have to t

There is an important news topic that is relevant to nearly everyone that shoul
d be addressed.  There is a sophisticated surveillance device that has been dev
eloped that allows the ability to monitor a person's thoughts from a distance.
 This device is far more powerful than wiretapping because a person's inner tho
ughts and motives can be listened to rather than just the person's speech.  Thi
s device is an extreme invasion of an individual's freedom and privacy.

In addition to being able to "listen in" to a person's thoughts, the device can
 also be used to input thoughts into a person's mind.  When this happens to an
individual, it seems as if the person is "hearing voices" and they may think th
ey are going insane.  So, what is particularly devious about this device is tha
t it can simulate a psychosis.  The device can augment the sense of psychosis b
y creating a very painful sensation in a person's mind.  It should be noted, th
at a psychiatrist would not be able to distinguish whether this person was trul
y mentally ill or whether this device was being used on them.  So, in effect, t
he device can be used to destroy a person's life by simulating a mental illness
 and it can also be used to incite an individual to commit suicide by creating 
a great deal of pain in a person's mind.

There are other features of the device such as controlling physiologic function
s and causing muscle spasms.

I realize that this device may seem unbelievable, but I'd like you to think abo
ut the ramifications this device has.  I cannot offer physical evidence that th
is device exists nor can I explain how I know it exists.  However, I believe it
 is one of the most important news items of our time.  It represents the loss o
f privacy and freedom to those who the device is being used against and can als
o be used to murder someone without a trace of evidence by inciting them to com
mit suicide.  I believe the use of this device should be regulated more closely
 or banned and its use be made public.

Please respond to this e-mail even if you think this sounds completely crazy an
d if you know anyone who might be of help, please forward this message.

Sincerely,

 looked at it quietly, but I think who ever is responsible for both the concept 
and the execution should receive some praise. The graphics usually comment on, d
isplay, represent, or play with the spotlight or a current theme in an interesti
ng way and often I have to smile how smart, witty, and pretty they are. In my vi
ew it is a wonderful representation of MIT's unique combination of thoughtfulnes
s and playfulness. Thanks - keep going!

Subject: Unified Field Theory


To whom it may concern,
Before reading this message may I advise you to show initiative and contact your
 superior. This is a sensible precaution even if my message proves of no value, 
which is not the case anyway.
I contacted the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority in August 1999 to tell th
em I had discovered a Theory of Gravity. Since then I have achieved the followin
g successes:
A Unified Field Theory completed November 1999
Faster than Light Communication shown possible.
Electron Shell positions fixed.
Path and Position of any Electron found.
Mathematical Proof of the Unified Field Theory.
Further progress, I do not wish to disclose here.
Unfortunately, I have not found anyone willing to be scientifically objective an
d listen to my objections to Quantum Mechanics.
I can find no one who is prepared to help me, rather than themselves, claim a No
bel Prize. Are you in a position to help?

I estimate the Western Alliance spends approximately #1 billion per annum lookin
g for this theory. That is #3 million per day! Furthermore no one has ever made 
a similar claim as mine. In fact the nuclear industry in the U.K. is not prepare
d to defend Quantum Mechanics so from a scientific point of view you would have 
to acknowledge my theory as superceding it.

Subject: Unidentified bug in the Microsoft mainframe, at Redmond Washington

I am researching the various sites which use DES3 on the Web - through WebTV.  The reason is that this service is the oldest service i
n the country, going back to the "Art Bell" show, from Las Vegas, Nevada, 
when Lewis Brothers (1-800-659-2669) were attempting to get their system up in 1995.  I could go into a lot of history, give you the f
ederal licensing numbers for the internet from the FCC Spectrum Management Division, and, even go  on to tell you that the Dept. of Co
mmerce, Federal Information Resource Management Division writes the technicals for cryptographs: computers; but that is not the reason
 I write, nor is it pertinent.  I was useing your search engine as topic with WebTV Corp., and the little known reality that it is the
 most comprehensive search engine, on line, probably greater in power than the search engine being put together Georgia Tech., under a
 consortium project, that's a couple of years old. 
However, I read the newspapers on February 11, and February 15, 2000, about the Web hacker attacks.  I write, because as the MIT searc
h engine was a topic with WebTV, I have had some Email bounced back to me about your search engine from Microsoft Corp., specificly, t
he <PostMaster@MicrosoftCorp.com>, and aware that the WebTV "Bryant 7r" computer was off line for nearly a two week period Thanksgivin
g,
and they had to convert Accounts to "Bryant Bryant",
I believed you would want to be made aware that apparently, the Microsoft mainframe at Redmond, Washington, may be `bugged', and that 
the website 
<NetCache4.1R6@netcache -1112> could be involved, if
linked to the Microsoft mainframe - however, don't hold me to that, it is just the way these returned 
Emails look, with that website in them.  I don't know, but thought it would be wiser to let you know.
Oh, I deal in antique books, and one of the very old AOL books has the original site <rtfm.mit.edu/pub>
listed as the most comprehensive search engine, in the standard file types chapter, for AOL 3.0, but again, this book came out before 
AOL 3.0 - and it is without copyright or Library of Congress id, just a book they mailed to individuals that they thought would use th
e service, back when they were poor.

Subject: New physics.


I have developed a new science which solves the cosmological
matter anti-matter assymetry problem.
This science also predicts particle decay modes using a new
type of conservation theory.  It reduces the number of
fundamental particles down to only one while eliminating
the concept of flavor (up, down, strange, charm, top, 
bottom). It also predicts and explains the apparent charge
non-conservation in the observed decay mode of 
(proton) -> (neutrino)+(anti-neutrino).  It explains the 
"strange" nature of "strange" matter, especially the 
neutral K meson. It offers a new theory about momentum and
unites sound into the particle physics world. It offers a 
new theory for electron tunneling. It explains away the 
"dark matter" problem. It offers a new theory for background
radiation. It has an interesting cosmologicac model.
It explains why the last term is negative in Minkowski's
space-time transformation (it has to do with how the first
dimention of time is related to the other two).
It also predicts how galaxies form. It offers a new theory 
for gravity. Plus a lot more.    

I want to offer my work to anyone who wants to hear about
it. In return, all I want is to be able to furthur my work
at any institution that is interested (especially since I
don't have the equipment to test my theory on gravitational
shielding using an interaction with a static field with

I want to build an applet that will be designed to let a person select an item of some sort and the quantity.Then the person will be asked 
to confirm the the things choosen so that they should be able to read it back with the total price and to make any changes requested by the
 person. 
I would like it to allow the user to enter details of an order i.e item ,quantity,Price,Item Total,calculate and display the price of item,
total cost,change details of order,enter amount given and change,display a bill for each order.It should be able to add the order price to 
the total reciepts of the day and reset the screen for next customer. 
If possible i would like it to have a function where a person could change prices of items or change ,delete or add the catergory of items.
 
Could you give me a solution or code that could implement the above. 

Could you email the solutions to me directly! at Ceaser20000_98@yahoo.com

You are perpetuating the use of illogically constructed date formats
on your  web pages.  They would look so much better if they
were formatted the way you would have formatted them given no
prior information.  Won't you please help in this matter?

It is the 2001st March 20th.

If in eighth grade, you were given the following word problem:

SS: A second cycles 0 - 59, there are 60 seconds in a minute
MM: A minute cycles 0 - 59, there are 60 minutes in an hour
HH: An hour cycles 0 - 23, there are 24 hours in a day
DD: A day cycles 1 - n, where n is determined by a month name
   or affiliated number, there are n days in the respective month.
MM: A month cycles 1 - 12, there are 12 months in a year
YYYY: is the count of the number of 12 month cycles.
Format these as a date-time-group.

Given no a priori knowledge, can you possibly think that in your
lifetime, you would have devised any format sequence other than
                        YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS ?

This should be part of an IQ test.  Maybe it was and I flunked.
Maybe we'll have to wait for a rude awakening or we don't pay
enough for energy.

Please do not use insidious date formats:

YYYY/MM/DD (HH:MM:SS), YYYY Mon DD or variations thereof.
You say you want to get into space faster, cheaper, safer?

Subject: the mit guide to lockpicking


Dear M.I.T,

I have just seen "the mit guide to lockpicking" on the internet. I am a locksmit
h in London uk. My family have been locksmiths for more than thirty years. I wou
ld like to say that I think it is a disgrace that you have been involved in pass
ing this information on to people who have no intention of becoming locksmiths.
As a locksmith I do not share the skills I have learned with ANYONE other then o
ther locksmiths or trainee locksmiths.  If I am in a bar with friends I would no
t give them detailed information on how to try and open locks as this would be h
ighly irresponsible.
I realise you are stating that you are not happy about the "guide" being on the 
internet and you want your name removed from it however, the fact that you have 
been involved with this "guide" which may well have been called "guide on how to
 encourage people to commit burglary" is a disgrace.
What sought of education institute are you?. You should be ashamed. You should a
lso consider using any power or influence you have to not just get your name rem
oved from this "guide" but getting this "guide" removed from the internet.

Yours sincerely,

Mr D Brennock

Hi,

You might be interested in the following response by the MIT Hacking
community on learning that the so-called "MIT Lockpicking Guide" was
available on the web:

http://www.mit.edu/afs/sipb.mit.edu/project/www/stock-answers/lockpicking-guide

Furthermore, the guide does not seem to be hosted on MIT servers, so
perhaps you should address your complaint to those who are making the
information available, or to those who authored the guide in the first
place.  We are the MIT Webmasters -- this doesn't fall under our
jurisdiction.

I am sorry to hear that you find the guide to be so objectionable;
however, MIT does not attempt to censor its students.  As an undergrad
myself, I can honestly say that I am quite thankful for this.  MIT
does not have a policy of holding students' hands.  Additionally, you
will note that the MIT hacking community is just a fraction of the MIT
population, so to make this into an attack on MIT as an institution is
perhaps a bit misguided.  There are hundreds of student groups at MIT,
and I'm sure there are several more with whom you might disagree.
That is no reason for the Institute to keep them on a tight leash or
do away with them.

Nobody need look very hard for something on the Internet which they
find to be offensive.  Perhaps you should look at this guide as more
of an appreciation for your trade, rather than as an attack on it.  I
am certain there is much respect among MIT students for your trade,
and, of all schools, at MIT you would probably find the most respect
for it.  The MIT hacking community does not encourage or condone
burglary or any other such crimes.  I think you would find there to be
a great deal of respect and consideration for others' property among
MIT students.  I do not see anything wrong with wanting to understand
or to learn how to do something, be it picking a lock or solving a
differential equation.

Sincerely,

Amrys O. Williams

We are looking for suggestions as to what he might need to get his first year st

It that would mean purchasing a t-shirt, hat, etc., than that's fine too.

But would really appreciate any suggestions you can make which would not necessa

mpus.  

Of course, we are wanting things that he would be allowed to have on campus.

Thank you for any help you can give to us.
