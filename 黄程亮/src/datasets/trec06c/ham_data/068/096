Hi,

I am a new DMDX user, and I have written a file to run videos. They seem to
run fine, except that often when the first, and only the first, video runs,
the words that appeared on the screen just before (ex. press the button to
start) flash and move around mostly hidden under the video that plays
first.  Any ideas?

Also, I would like to run DMDX, including the video files, on a laptop
computer.  Any recommendations for a current laptop model that will run
DMDX well, particularly with videos?
Thanks.

Cheers,
Chris
