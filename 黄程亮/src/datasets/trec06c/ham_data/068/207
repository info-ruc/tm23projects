Hi

I need to communicate with my handy board using the serial port using
the Interrupt for SCI. I tried to test several programs that I found,
without success. My basic test is the following. 

	1.- I created and .asm file which is a copy of the "sysibeep.asm"
example of the "interrupt-driven binary Programs" chapter of the IC
manual, but instead of TOC4INT, I coded SCIINT. I created the
corresponding .icb file.

	2.- In my IC test program I poked the addess 0x102d to the value 0x2c
to enable SCI interrupts, and after that I coded and infinite loop.
I loaded this file and run.

	In this situation, I started a vt emulation on my computer and send a
lot of characters (ie: holding a key down), the expected result should be
a low frequency sound of more or less 600 Hz (9600/(8*2)), that I get
is... that when the first character is sent, the handyBoard heart stops,
and I have o reset.


	what is wrong?, there is any conflict between the SCI interrup and the
others that IC uses? 


:-) 

Miguel
