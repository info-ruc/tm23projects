Hello all,

Gerrit and I spoke on the phone this morning, and it
turns out that this week is the last that we will
all overlap (Gerrit leaves on June 1, I am leaving 
tommorrow -Thurs- evening until May 31). So, I think
we should have one iteration of all our talks done
this week. 

I am constructing a web site with an outline
of my talk and some of the relevant figures
(http://rainbow.ldeo.columbia.edu/~clement/frontiers.html).
It is very much in progress, but contains the overall
content of what I intend to say. 

Having looked at Gerrit's web page, I think the material 
is too much to cover in 25 minutes (though all the figures
are likely to be relevant for the discussion). Here are
some suggestions:

Martin could cover something about the paleoclimate perspective
(observations, NADW), and leave Gerrit to talk more about
greenhouse warming and models (with some discussion of NADW
for both, and also NAO). 

Gerrit's section on "Climate variability in the last millenium"
would be a good lead in to his talk (leave the NAO, and
Paleoclimate change for discussion or Martin's talk). "Climate
transitions" could also be covered by Martin. 

I will talk a bit more about simple models of ENSO, and then 
refer to GCM results for past/future experiments. I will also 
talk a bit about proxy data (which I listed). I will limit
this to some figures, and maybe leave the details for the 
discussion. 


What do you think?

Amy
