I found the documentation for the MC68HC11F1 series on the Motorola web site
at this URL:

http://199.104.132.208/ProdCat/psp/0,1250,68HC11F1~M98635,00.html

The documentation is in an 848k PDF file:

http://ebus.mot-sps.com/brdata/PDFDB/MICROCONTROLLERS/8-BIT/M951447426892col
lateral.pdf

The picture you're looking for is on page 2-1, which is actually page 15 of
the document according to Acrobat.
