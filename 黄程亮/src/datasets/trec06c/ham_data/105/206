Jonathan,
If I had any control over the resources, I would upgrade.  However,
other labs using this facility (an fMRI center) are using Presentation
for stimulus control and that software makes a big deal about claiming
to get better timing precision on Win98 than later versions of
windows.

We are willing to take a shotgun approach to trying to fix this
problem on Win98.  As I said in previous emails, we updated DirectX,
checked and updated the codec, and tried pre-loading with medialife. 
We are considering blindly trying the following:
1.  Changing movie formats to everything else that we can try (Mpeg,
quicktime, and anything else we can track down codecs for)

2.  Changing the color depth of the movie files from 24 bit (which
they currently are) to 16 bit.

3.  Updating the drivers for the video card.

Is there anything else that comes to mind to you that we might try (we
are willing to try low probability fixes too!)

Best, John
