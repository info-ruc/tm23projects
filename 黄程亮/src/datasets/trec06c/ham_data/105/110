Dear Colleagues,

I have been asked the following question, and do not know of such a =
program. Is there one? Is it available?

"Do you know about any program which can make inclusion  of the =
eigenvalues for a positive definite matrix say with 1000 or  more =
unknowns for example of the finite element type? If so do you have some =
experience with that?"

best regards,

Ray Moore
