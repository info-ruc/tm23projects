   Well that was a lot easier than it might have otherwise been.  DMDX 
3.1.4.1 should be up on the web page and that fixes the <Delay> 
inconsistencies that have been seen lately.  The <ContinuosRunning> and 
<Delay> keywords function as they did before however <cr> is no longer 
subject to the race conditions that later CPUs were capable of and in 
addition will not be subject to inconsistent delays on an excessively 
loaded CPU either.  Hopefully I've coded it in such a fashion as to not 
interfere with anything else...
