   That's the first of your problems then, P&P monitors don't do much more 
than 85 Hz.  You'll have to find the disk that came with the monitor and 
install some drivers for it, if it didn't come with a disk you'll have to 
find them on the internet or bug the manufacturer or salesperson for 
them.  Once XP recognizes the monitor there's a good chance you'll get to 
use the faster refresh rates.  If not try reinstalling the video drivers 
after getting XP to recognize the monitor (I saw some Intel video drivers 
need this here the other day).
