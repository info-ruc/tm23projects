I am trying to display a word at a random location on the screen.
For that, I set c1 and c2 for a random value. e.g., < set c1 = 170 +
300 * random(2) > .
I display the item with  <XY c1, c2> "item" - but it always displays it at 0,0.
If I use instead hard wired numbers (e.g., <XY, 170, 100> ), it works.

Am I doing something wrong? what would be the right way to do it, or
the least painful workaround..?
Thanks.
