I am a new user of DMDX in china(so my system language is simplified 
chinese),and I have a question about the branching keyword. I want to 
display some bitmap pictures in circulation.But it dosn't work as my wish.
My script is following:
<ep> <vm 800 600 600 16 75><nfb></ep>
0 <set c1=0>;
1 <ms% 1000><bmp>"1";
2 <ms% 1000><bmp>"2";
3 <ms% 1000><bmp>"2", <ms% 1000><bmp>"1";
4 <inc 1><bi 1,(c1 .lt. 2)>;
0 "the end";

But there is no circulation! the diagnostics is following:
DMDX Vers. 3.1.4.1 08/19/2005 12:29:49 on machine PSYLAB-DPS2NPES

I can't use the branching keywords as what is instructed in the DMDX help 
files.On the other hand, I found that the circulation can be made by adding 
a symbol '!' before the end line, the modified script is following:
<ep> <vm 800 600 600 16 75><nfb></ep>
0 <set c1=0>;
1 <ms% 1000><bmp>°±1°±;
2 <ms% 1000><bmp>°±2°±;
3 <ms% 1000><bmp>°±2°±, <ms% 1000><bmp>°±1°±;
4 <inc 1><bi 1,(c1 .lt. 2)>;
!0 °∞end°±;

Although it runs, there is still somthing wrong -- DMDX warnded me "read 
error". The diagnostics is following:
DMDX Vers. 3.1.4.1 08/19/2005 12:39:18 on machine PSYLAB-DPS2NPES

What's the matter? And what I should do to make the pictures displaying 
circularly ? I beg your advice. 

Thanks a lot,
best wishes.
