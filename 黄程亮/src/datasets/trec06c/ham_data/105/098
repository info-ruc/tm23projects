Dear fellow intervalers,

Andreas Frommer and I will be guest editors for one of the next
issues of the ECMI Newsletter, a journal of the European
Consortium for Mathematics in Industry; see
    http://www.ecmi-indmath.org
This issue is intended as a vehicle for promoting ideas from
result-verifying computing (interval and related methods) to
engineers working in industry. Given the format and audience
of the journal, each contribution should be kind of an
"appetizer", i.e., it should
- be short (2 pp max)
- describe an application of result-verifying computing,
   either in cooperation with industry or with obvious impact
   to industry, and
- keep technical details at a minimum and instead give pointers.
The contributions will be preceded by a short introduction into
interval (and related) methods.
Note that the papers will NOT undergo a full peer review
process.

If you are interested in contributing to this issue, please send
us a short (plain text) message describing the application and
how result-verifying methods came into play. Based on these
descriptions we will select the contributions and contact you
for the submission of the full length (2pp) version.
With your help, we hope to collect at least half a dozen
applications highlighting different aspects of result-verifying
methods.

Andreas Frommer (frommer@math.uni-wuppertal.de) and
Bruno Lang (lang@math.uni-wuppertal.de)
