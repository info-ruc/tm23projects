Put <id tastiera> in the parameter line of the item file.  Because DMDX 
doesn't recognize that device you'll also have to map the shift keys (or 
other keys if you don't like the shift keys) to the responses with <mpr 
+someitaliankeyname>, <mnr +someitaliankeyname> and <mr 
+someitaliankeyname>.  You'll have to use TimeDX's input test to see what 
someitaliankeyname should be.
