Dear Intervalers,

I am looking for some simple examples of practical
problems involving control (controllable) and tolerance 
(tolerable) solution sets of interval linear systems 
of equations. I would greatly appreciate obtaining references 
to appropriate papers, or possibly descriptions 
of the examples.
