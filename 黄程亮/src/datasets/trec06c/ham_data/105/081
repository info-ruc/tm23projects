Hi Jonathan,

There's a good chance I'm not using <clfb> correctly.  It seems to behave
identically to <nfb> for me.  It could be this computer however.  I've had
problems with it running DMDX before.  However, hopefully this is not the
case and there's something simple I'm forgetting.


The code below allows me to display pictures for 3 seconds, after which they
disappear:

<ep>  <d 38>  <ntl> <cr> <vm 800,600,600,16,0> <clfb> <XYJustification 1>
<id "keyboard"> <id "mouse"> <zil> <zor> <vzk +w> <vzk +m> <vzk +f> <mpr +m>
<mpr +f> <DBC 0> <DWC 0002510000> <aikn +m> <aikn +f>  </ep>
0 "Please press SPACE to start";

=1 <ms% 1000> <bmp> "CROSS" / <bmp> <x 0.5><y 0.5>* <ms% 3000>
"ALAF263_f2m_btm" /; 

=2 <ms% 1000> <bmp> "CROSS" /  <bmp> <x 0.5><y 0.5>*  <ms% 3000>
"ALAF263_f2m_top" /;


The identical code, removing the "/" at the end of the item line gives me
the other behaviour I require, that is, the picture disappears immediately
when the participant responds.  

Unfortunately, I need to be able to do both! The picture disappears after 3
seconds or when the particpant responds within 3 seconds.  I'm experimenting
with <ContinueProgressiveX> at the moment to span items but hopefully there
is a much simpler way to achieve this. 

Thanks for your help, Andy.

Why doesn't <clfb> solve your problem?
