   Those are all good things but I'd be trying a reformat too, win98 can 
build up crud and just tank on it's own without anything specific being 
wrong.  I guess you could tamper with the retrace interval timing 
parameters, giving less sleep time or smaller number of lines to blit to 
give the video decoder more time to do it's thing.  Perhaps a larger number 
of lines to blit would work too, who knows, it's a big black box.
