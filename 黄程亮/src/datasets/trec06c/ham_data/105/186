Hi all,

I am not sure whether this is an issue with dmdx, or something else, 
but i am encountering frequent problems running item files, and the 
error message indicates that dmdx cannot open any of the .wavs 
or .bmps. The problem started occuring fairly suddenly. I can't see 
anything wrong with my .rtf script, and indeed sometimes, dmdx will run 
the item file without any difficulties at all - implying that it can 
find the files in the folder containing the dmdx program. But why 
doesn't it work all the time? I've reinstalled the newest version of 
dmdx, and the problem continues. Does anyone have any ideas?

regards
Ranmalee  

Here is a short example of one of my files:
