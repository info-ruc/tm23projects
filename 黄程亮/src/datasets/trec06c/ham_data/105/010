Hello,

You can find a "Filtered Hosts" list further down in this message.
If your host is in this list, then ..

1. Make sure that the host has been completely cleaned up. Unless the
host is completely rebuilt, please make sure that the host is not
running any rogue IRC bots, FTP servers, VNC, etc. Tools like "tcpview"
and "procexp" from www.sysinternals.com or Vision from
www.foundstone.com (under the Resources section) should help to locate
any such services.

2. Send an email message to security@ucsb.edu to inform us that the host
is now safe to be connected with the internet. When referring to
multiple IP addresses, please list the IP addresses on separate lines.
If you are not the NOC's official network contact for the address(es),
then be sure to CC that person. If you decide to simply reply to this
message, please do *not* include the complete lists of IPs. Please just
include the IP(s) that you are writing to us about.

3. If you find any rogue services running, please include the type of
service and the port that it was using.
