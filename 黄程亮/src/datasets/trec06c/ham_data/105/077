Sorry, I don't think I made my problem that clear.  

I'm designing an experiment where the participant sees a picture and must
make a response to it.  The picture will either remain on the screen for 3
seconds, or will be removed from the screen if a response is made before
those 3 seconds are up.  There is no time limit however for the participant
to respond to a given picture (hence <ntl>) once that picture is removed
from view. 

Unfortunately adding a blank frame to the end of the item will ensure that
the picture lasts for the entire duration to which it was set (in my case,
the default frame duration). If the participant responds before this time is
up, the picture will not immediately disappear as needed. 

I've played with the abort function, <t 4000> (note the 1000ms for
displaying the "CROSS" bmp), <clfb> and am now stuck for ideas! The only way
I can think of around this problem is to create static video files of my
pictures that last for 3 seconds and use this in conjunction with the abort
function. 

Thanks, Andy.

I think all you need to do is add another (blank) frame after the picture,
like this:

=1 <ms% 1000> <bmp> "CROSS" / <bmp> <x 0.5><y 0.5>* "ALAF263_f2m_btm" / ; 

Also, if you want three seconds, you probably want <t 3000> in the header

hope that helps

Matthew
