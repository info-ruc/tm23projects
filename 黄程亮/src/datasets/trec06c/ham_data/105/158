I am having a problem playing movies (avi files) in DMDX.  We are
using the most recent version of DMDX on a Win98 machine (its a shared
fMRI lab and the person responsible for computers is not willing to
upgrade OS).

The avi files slow noticeably for the last handful of frames.  On
occasion, there is even noticeable slowing in the middle of the (3
second) movie.  The movies do play  normally (without slowing) using
windows media player.  The movies also play normally with DMDX on a
few other machines running XP.  Thoughts on where the problem lies
with this Win98 machine?

Thanks for any help?
John
