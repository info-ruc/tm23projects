Dear DMDX power users,
I am trying to create an experiment in DMDX for the first time. I need
to change the text color within the same word. I can change the
default color for the entire text, but cannot control it for each
letter. I tried
- "A <wc..> B <wc...> C" but I get the whole string with the control
sequence right back at me.
- "A" <wc..> "B" <wc...> "C" but I get error message regarding
multiple text segments in same item.
- "A /cf.. B /cf.. C"  but I get "ABC" in one uniform (default) color. 
- "A" /cf.. "B" /cf.. "C" gives the same multiple text segments error
described above.

I searched the list archives and couldn't find anything relevant.

Hopefully someone here can help me out?
Many thanks,
-Yuval.
