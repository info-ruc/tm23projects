   You could have to use a counter and code it's value for various screen 
locations.  You can then branch on that counter to one of many items that 
display the various possible screens.

   Correct, calls happen in between items.

   Build your item file with 50% of the items on the left and 50% on the 
right and let DMDX scramble the item file for you.  You assemble all 
possible displays explicitly and then let DMDX randomize their presentation 
order with scramble parameters or come up with some sort of branching 
scheme that selects the displays you want when.
