*************************************************************************=

The workshop "Methods for Modalities" (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods =
and
tools based on modal logics. Here the term "modal logics" is conceived
broadly, including description logic, guarded fragments, conditional =
logic,
temporal and hybrid logic, etc.

   To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature =
a
number of invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations =
aimed
at highlighting new developments, and submissions of system =
demonstrations.
We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers =
and
posters, especially for experimental and prototypical software tools =
which
are related to modal logics.

Invited speakers:
   Fran=E7ois Laroussinie, ENS Cachan and CNRS
   Martin Lange, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit=E4t
   Wim Martens, Hasselt University
   Boris Motik, Universit=E4t Karlsruhe
   Boris Konev, University of Liverpool
   Uwe Scheffler, Humboldt Universit=E4t

   Regular papers should not exceed the length of 12 pages; short papers =
are
up to six pages of length, and posters and tools can be presented on two
pages of text. Proceedings will appear online and as a Humboldt =
university
report. Depending on the submissions, papers may be selected to appear =
in a
special issue of an appropriate journal.
Submission is by internet or email. You can (preferrably) upload your
PostScript or PDF contribution to the address
http://www.easychair.org/M4M-4/submit/ or (alternatively) send it to
m4m-4@first.fraunhofer.de.

   The workshop will take place in Berlin - Adlershof, Germany, which is =
one
of the worlds largest science and technology areas, comprising twelve
research institutes, six faculties of the Humboldt University of Berlin, =
and
more than 370 high tech companies. It is hosted by FIRST, the Fraunhofer
Institute of Computer Architecture and Software Technology, in =
collaboration
with the computer science institute of Humboldt University.

For more information and registration information, see the M4M homepage =
at
   http://m4m.loria.fr/

  Deadline for submissions: September 15th, 2005 (extended!)
  Notification: October 17, 2005
  Camera ready versions: November 8, 2005
  Workshop dates: December 1-2, 2005

The program committee for M4M consists of
   Holger Schlingloff, Humboldt University / FIRST (local =
organizations);
   Carlos Areces, INRIA Lorraine;
   Patrick Blackburn, INRIA Lorraine;
   Torben Brauner, Roskilde University;
   Stephane Demri, ENS de Cachan;
