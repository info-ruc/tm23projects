Nathalie,

            Something is seriously wrong, obviously.  Jonathan is away =
at
the moment, and you probably won=92t get a comment from him until =
Friday.
However, on our system with very ordinary monitors, I can get 100 hz -- =
but
not at your screen resolution. We just select a lower resolution (the =
video
card is an NVIDIA RIVA TNT2).

Hi!=20

I wrote a while back with a question about resolution and refresh rates. =
I
have a new monitor Iiyama HM204DT and the specs say that at 1024x 768 =
res.,
I can have a refresh rate of maximum 178Hz. At the moment, my screen is =
set
on 1024 x 768 res. and at a refresh rate of 160 Hz. This is a new =
monitor
bought because of these specific possibilities - high refresh rate at
high-ish resolution. My Video card is a Radeon 7500 with the latest =
drivers
installed. I called ATI and the support people there told me this card, =
with
the proper monitor, which I now have, can support up to 200 Hz refresh =
rate.
Still, with this equipement, I get a maximum refresh rate of 85Hz in =
TimeDX
in the Select Video Mode Menu. What do I need to do to have DMDX run at =
the
high refresh rate that I need?

Thanks for your help,=20

Hello!=20

I wish to run a masked priming experiment with DMDX. My prime durations =
are
extremely brief (14, 24 and 34 ms) and it was recommended to me that I =
set
my screen refresh rate very high to avoid much variability in the
presentation of my primes. I also need this resolution because I will be
running an eye-tracking study with the same stimuli and prime durations. =
I
need both experimentations to be compatible. I have a couple of
interrogations:=20

(1) The video mode in DMDX can be set at 85 Hz maximum and I am =
wondering
what setting I should use since my monitor is set at 160hz.=20


  Your monitor might be capable of running at 160Hz but it isn't set at
160Hz, it will run at any speed up to 160Hz.  DMDX simply reflects what =
the
operating system says the display can handle, if it's not what you want =
you
can try new video drivers and if that doesn't work you'll probably have =
to
get a new video card.=20





I have already tried the help files and I have read a thread on this in =
the
mailinig list but I didn't really understand. I am very new at dealing =
with
hardware and timing issues. If someone could provide me info in laymen
terms, I would appreciate. I have updated the pilots of my monitor
(ViewSonic P95f+) and of my graphic card (Radeon 7500).=20


  My guess based on my experience with Radeon 7500 is that it isn't =
capable
of providing a display at 160Hz.=20





(2) Also, when I run the millisecond timer test in the basic tests =
section,
it gives me a value of -0.00 ms for the refresh rate! Somehow, I think =
that
is now quite what it should be.=20


  You can try checking the "Read Between Flips to stop Cheating Video
Drivers".  If that doesn't get it it sounds like you're a prime =
candidate
for new video drivers from ati.com.=20
