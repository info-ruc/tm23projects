Jonathan,
Thanks for your fast reply.
Sorry to bother you again with such a seemingly simple issue, but
applying your answer in quotation marks,  I get the "<font..>" as part
of the displayed string; preceding the inner quotation marks with a
backslash gives an error: unknown (\") ; applying it without quotation
marks altogether, I get the error "unknown keyword <FONT>".  I guess
it is just a small syntax issue that I am still missing.
Could I ask you to send me a code snippet? (If possible, as an
attachment, because my mail reader showed your answer as HTML.. in
violation of your ascii ribbon campaign...)
Thanks again,
-Yuval.
