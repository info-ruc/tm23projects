Dear Colleague,

Please, take a look at the following papers:

G.L. Litvinov and S.N. Sobolevskii,
1) Exact interval solutions to the discrete Bellman
   equation and polynomial complexity of problems
   in interval idempotent linear algebra, Doklady
   Mathematics, v. 62, 2000, #2, p. 199-201. It is
  available in arXiv: math.RA/0101041 (http://arXiv.org).

2) Idempotent interval analysis and optimization problems,
   Reliable Computing, v. 7, 2001, #5, p. 353-377. It is
available in arXiv: math.NA/0101080 (http://arXiv.org).

See also references in these papers.
The idea is that basic optimization problems and their
interval versions are linear over appropriate numerical
idempotent semirings. In this case there is a very good
interval analysis (interval estimates are exact) and
parallel interval computations can be implemented by the
same way as in the traditional linear algebra. The
corresponding interval problems are polynomial.

With all the best wishes,
Grigory Litvinov
