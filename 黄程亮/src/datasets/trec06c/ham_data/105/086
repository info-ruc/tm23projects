Precedence: list

in that case, can i set the "cursor" position in one item, and make
DMDX remember it in the next?  ( i assume i cannot call a subroutine
and expect it to return to the next frame of the calling item, as
opposed to the first frame of the item that comes after the calling
item).

maybe you can refer me to a "lateralized" experiment script, in which
the items are randomly displayed to the left or right of fixation?

thanks.
