Dear colleagues,

As you are probably aware, southeastern Louisiana has suffered a
major natural disaster this past week.  I am happy to report that
Lafayette (where I live) and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette
is to the west (and slightly north) of the devastated area, and has suffered 
no physical damage.  However, we are noticing major effects on 
communications and services.  In particular, although telephone service
(both cellular and wired) is normal within the city, traditional
long-distance telephone service into and out of the city is virtually 
impossible.

Internet service (including the reliable_computing mailing list) has
been uninterrupted, and is apparently normal.  However, I am told
that the bandwidth of the trunk to which  our university is connected
has been significantly cut, partially due to loss of infrastructure and
partially due to pre-emptive use by emergency services.  This shouldn't
affect the reliable_computing list, with reasonably-sized messages
and about 500 subscribers, so please continue to use the list, 
as appropriate.  (The things to avoid, temporarily, would be
streaming video into and out of the university, and similar things.
I don't think that applies to our activities, though.)

If any of you have colleagues at Tulane University, Loyola University
at New Orleans, the University of New Orleans, etc., do not expect 
these colleagues to be at their New Orleans addresses for 
at least several months.  However, many of these colleagues are
at other universities, and in particular at the University of
Louisiana at Lafayette.  Furthermore, these faculty have been
assured that they still have jobs.  In the mean time, the 
University's population (and, for that matter Lafayette's) is 
significantly larger than a week ago, and growing daily.

Best regards,

Baker
