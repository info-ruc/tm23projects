Hi,

My name is Joanna Musial. I am Montclair State University undergraduate student. I use DMDX program in my research.
I have a problem with running the experiment.
The computer shows below message everytime I try to run a syntax check: 
 
Getting file - Wait
No scramble
Scrambled File is <rtf parsed.itm>
available DI device <mouse> [Mouse]
available DI device <tastiera> [Tastiera]
Input device <keyboard> selection failed
 
Tastiera in Italian means keyboard, that is why I thought it could depend on the Italian keyboard set up in my laptop. I set up the American keyboard, but it doesn't work either. This is the farthest the program goes.
 
If I just click on RUN without trying to run any syntax check, the answer is the same.

I'd appreciate any help.

Sincerely,

Joanna Musial
