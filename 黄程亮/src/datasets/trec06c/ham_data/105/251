Dear Interval Researchers,

Thanks for pointed papers.
They are from years 2001 - 2002, so it still seems there is a ,,crisis'' 
in this field for the last four years.
Or maybe is this topic ,,finished'' an no more signifficant results may be 
obtained there ? At least using present techniques ?
What are your opinions ?

With best regards
 	Bartlomiej Kubica
