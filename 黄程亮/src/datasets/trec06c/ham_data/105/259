Dear user,

Your request

		 	SUBSCRIBE CS382M Course Archive

has been successfully processed.

		********** CS382M WELCOME MESSAGE **********

****************************************************************
Welcome to the CS382M mailing list.  This list is intended to be used 
for
broadcast of necessary information to the students enrolled in the 
class.

Please do not spam the list.  Please do not send subscription or
unsubscription requests to the list.
****************************************************************

		********** HOW TO POST TO THE LIST **********

Welcome to list CS382M (cs382m@lists.cc.utexas.edu).

The system has recorded your address as

			cs382m-archive@cs.utexas.edu

and it is required that you send your postings from this address.

		********** HOW TO GET OFF THE LIST **********

To sign off from the list, email to
			listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu

with the following request:

			signoff CS382M
or
			unsubscribe CS382M

		********** GETTING YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ATTRIBUTES **********

You may get your current subscription attributes at any time by sending the
following request to listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu:

			query CS382M

		********** WHERE TO SEND EMAIL **********

If you want to post messages to list CS382M, you should direct your 
email to
		cs382m@lists.cc.utexas.edu,

not listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu. 

If you wish to send requests please do not send them to the list -- they 
will not be processed. Instead direct them to
		listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu

Requests sent to the server should be placed in the body of the 
email message, not the Subject:. ListProc ignores requests in the Subject: 
field.

You can, however, put as many requests as you like in one mail message; each
request should be on a line by itself. If your request is too long for your
mailer to handle, you can break it in multiple lines, but each line should
end with the character & (ampersand). For example, here are two separate
requests:

set CS382M &
mail &
ack
help

The ampersands in the above example are immediately followed by carriage
returns. The above requests are equivalent to:

			set CS382M mail ack
			help

		********** DIGESTS **********

All messages posted to this list are also available in daily digests.
If you wish to receive messages in digest format you may send the following
request to listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu:

			set CS382M mail digest

		********** LIST OWNERS **********

The list's owners are skeckler@cs.utexas.edu .
You should contact them if there are any problems.

		********** YOUR LISTPROC PASSWORD **********

The system has assigned you an initial password: 1125500599
You may change it by sending the following request to listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu:

		set CS382M password 1125500599 new-password

where new-password is the new string of characters that you would like
to use as your ListProc password.

WARNING: You should NOT use your login password as this is not a secure
mechanism.

This password is to be used when connecting to this server over the Internet
for interactive processing of requests (send a 'help live' request for more
information)
Statistics for this list are available to privileged users (e.g. owners) only.
Review requests are available to privileged users (e.g. owners) only.

		********** ACCESS TO THE LIST'S ARCHIVES **********

The list is not currently archived, therefore it is not possible to get past
postings.

		********** HOW TO GET MORE HELP **********

following request to listproc@lists.cc.utexas.edu:
