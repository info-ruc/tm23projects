A rather belated response to Keith's query: the Inspiron 6000 that I purchased 
appears to run the lastest versions of DMDX just fine so far, although I have 
not run any really display time critical experiments on this machine as yet.

Also, my machine has rather an annoying low level buzz during wav file 
recording that I have not been able to eliminate, but this may be just an 
idiosyncratic problem (I still need to consult Dell regarding this issue). 

With respect to the UMA 1600GT suffix, I'm afraid I'm not much help in that 
department, although I can tell you that it refers at least partially to the 
particular type of Intel graphics chip used for that version of the laptop.

Best wishes,
Anna W.
