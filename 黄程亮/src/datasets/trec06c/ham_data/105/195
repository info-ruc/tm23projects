Dear Interval Researchers,

At the moment I'm interested in links between parallel computations and 
intervals - in a very wide meaning: from simple parallelizations of a 
branch-and-bound method to quite sophisticated methods and applications.

I have two questions:

1) Do you know any _recent_ papers dealing with parallel interval methods ?
I have found several papers, but they are quite old - usually from before 
the year 2000.

2) Doeas any of you have access to works about so-called ,,wave 
computations'', a concept developed by Russian scientists (Yakovlev, 
Musaev et al.), using parallel inteval methods with not the full precison, 
but only as much as is required (roughly speaking) ?

Thank you in advance
 	Bartlomiej Kubica
