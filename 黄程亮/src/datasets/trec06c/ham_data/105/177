Hi!

I wrote a while back with a question about resolution and refresh rates. 
I have a new monitor Iiyama HM204DT and the specs say that at 1024x 768 
res., I can have a refresh rate of maximum 178Hz. At the moment, my 
screen is set on 1024 x 768 res. and at a refresh rate of 160 Hz. This 
is a new monitor bought because of these specific possibilities - high 
refresh rate at high-ish resolution. My Video card is a Radeon 7500 with 
the latest drivers installed. I called ATI and the support people there 
told me this card, with the proper monitor, which I now have, can 
support up to 200 Hz refresh rate. Still, with this equipement, I get a 
maximum refresh rate of 85Hz in TimeDX in the Select Video Mode Menu. 
What do I need to do to have DMDX run at the high refresh rate that I need?

Thanks for your help,

Nathalie

&nbsp; Your monitor might be capable of running at 160Hz but it isn't set at  160Hz,
it will run at any speed up to 160Hz.&nbsp; DMDX simply reflects what the  operating
system says the display can handle, if it's not what you want you  can try
new video drivers and if that doesn't work you'll probably have to  get a
new video card. <br>
