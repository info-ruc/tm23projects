Jonathan, Anna, and all,
Just in case I haven't written I solved the problem, here it is (again?):
the problem seems to have been in the header line (see below). When I
replaced it with a header line I took from another file, things
started working. Now I can use WordPad, highlight, select color, font,
etc., as you suggested, and actually see the same (WYSIWYG) at
runtime..
Thanks for all the advice!
-Yuval.
