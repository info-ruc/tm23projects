Dear members of this group,

On the following web page
=20
http://pownuk.prv.pl/interval_web_applications.htm

There are web applications which calculate displacements=20
of truss structures with interval parameters.=20
Binary version of the program is also included.
Additionally there is a solution program which calculates=20
of non-stationary diffusion equations with interval parameters.=20
=20

The algorithms of calculations are based on sensitivity analysis=20
and gives only approximate results=20
but maybe some members of this group=20
will be interested of the results,=20
which are generated by these programs just for comparison.

Regards,

Andrzej Pownuk
