I recall having trouble with changing text colour in this fashion some time 
ago.  I am ashamed to admit that I never really got to the bottom of the 
problem, but I did use the following syntax to get around it:

+500 <ms% 500> "+" / <ms% 0> <wc 111000000> "a  "/ ! <ms% 0> <wc 000022000> " 
b " / ! <wc 000000003> "  c" *;

What this does is just tell DMDX to prepare the frame with "a" in one colour, 
hold that in memory, prepare "b" in another colour, hold that in memory, 
prepare "c" in yet another colour, and then display them all together.

The main problem with adopting this solution is that it limits you to using 
only nonproportional fonts (e.g. Courier), otherwise your different letters 
will overlap at display.

I'm sure that Jonathan can offer a far more elegant solution than the one I 
have outlined here, but I thought I would just mention this alternative in case 
it might prove useful.

Best wishes,
Anna W.
