> Dear Interval Researchers,
>
> At the moment I'm interested in links between parallel computations and
> intervals - in a very wide meaning: from simple parallelizations of a
> branch-and-bound method to quite sophisticated methods and applications.
>
> I have two questions:
>
> 1) Do you know any _recent_ papers dealing with parallel interval methods ?
> I have found several papers, but they are quite old - usually from before
> the year 2000.
>
> 2) Doeas any of you have access to works about so-called ,,wave
> computations'', a concept developed by Russian scientists (Yakovlev,
> Musaev et al.), using parallel inteval methods with not the full precison,
> but only as much as is required (roughly speaking) ?
>
> Thank you in advance
