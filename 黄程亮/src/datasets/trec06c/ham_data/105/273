Thank you Aaron for kindly responding. I appreciate your warning etc  
regarding inversions and thank you for the comments. I had looked at  
all the files generated by mauve and did realize that the information  
was in .alignment file and had used grep with the "-'" to find  
inversions. I also downloaded GRIL and just downloaded badger. Thanks  
for the tips.
Dennis
