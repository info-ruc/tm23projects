The Seventh Annual Graduate Symposium
on Women's and Gender History
"Mobility"
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
March 9-11, 2006
SUBMISSION DEADLINE: NOVEMBER 1, 2005

The Executive Committee of the Seventh Annual Graduate
Symposium on Women's and Gender History at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign announces a call for papers.
The Symposium, which is part of activities on campus in
recognition of Women's History Month, is scheduled for March
9-11, 2006. To celebrate and encourage further work in the
field of women's and gender history, we invite submissions
from graduate students from any institution or discipline on
topics in women's and gender history that address the theme
of "Mobility." Papers or panels may address, but should not
be limited to the following:

? Performativity and the Body
? Cosmopolitanisms
? Boundaries and Restraints: Material and Imagined
? Intra- and Trans-national flows of goods and ideas
? Social Mobility
? The Construction and Experience of Public and Private
Spaces
? Globalization and Feminist Theory

We welcome papers on any historical subject that might grow
out of a variety of disciplines and engage diverse
methodologies. We also invite panel submissions consisting
of three papers, although each of the three papers will be
judged on its individual merit. In addition, we encourage
papers and panels analyzing the state of the field in
women's and gender history. Preference will be given to
scholars who did not present a paper at last year's Sixth
Annual Graduate Symposium on Women's and Gender History.

We are pleased to announce that Jennifer L. Morgan,
Associate Professor of History and Women's and Gender
Studies at Rutgers and author of Laboring Women:
Reproduction and Gender in New World Slavery (University of
Pennsylvania Press, 2004) will deliver the keynote address
on Thursday, March 9th.

Presenters at the conference will have the opportunity to
publish their work in the on-line proceedings volume.

We have limited funds available to assist with the cost of
travel for presenters who have limited conference
experience. These funds will be allocated based on the
quality of the proposal and the distance to be traveled.

All submissions must be received by November 1, 2005.

To submit a paper or panel in a hard copy format, please
send five (5) copies of a 250-word abstract AND a one-page
curriculum vitae for EACH paper presenter, commentator, or
panel chair to:
Programming Committee
Graduate Symposium on Women's and Gender History
309 Gregory Hall, MC 466
810 South Wright Street
Urbana, Illinois 61801

To submit a paper or panel by email, please send ONLY ONE
attachment in Word format containing all abstracts and
curriculum vitae. The subject line of the email must
read "Attn: Programming Committee" and should be sent to
gendersymp@uiuc.edu. We cannot be responsible for
submissions that do not meet these conditions.

Panel submissions are highly encouraged to find chairs and
commentators best suited to comment on the work presented
and should include a one-paragraph description of the panel
as well as curriculum vitae for all participants including
the commentator and/or chair.

We also invite graduate students to serve as commentators
and professors to serve as chairs for panels. These
individuals should submit curriculum vitae to
gendersymp@uiuc.edu with the subject line: Attn: Programming
Committee.
