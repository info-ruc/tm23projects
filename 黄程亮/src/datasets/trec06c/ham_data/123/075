Hi FGP class,

I just got a question about the formatting of the final report, and I 
wanted to share the answer with the whole class.

The question was: Does the report need to be formatted in double-column
format like ACM publications?

Answer: No.


Although the requirements for the final project say that the writeup
should be conference-quality, I don't mean for this to refer to
page layout.  Instead, I mean for this to refer to the content --
do you describe your work as you would in a conference paper?  Do
you cite previous work as you would in a conference paper? etc.

Please focus on the content, not the layout.

Having said that, if you want to use a two-page layout, that
is fine!  Just don't spend two days hacking on LaTeX to do it.

Bill
