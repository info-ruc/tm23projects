Subject: [FGP] Everyone gets an extension on final project writeup

Hi FGP class,

The combination of requests for an extension last Thursday and
a desire on my part to make up for being a bit slow in giving feedback
on the mid-project reports has led me to decide that... (drumroll)...
Everyone gets an extension on the final project due date.

Presentations are still due in class on Thursday,
but the final reports are not due until *Tuesday May 9th at 11:59pm*.

I hope this will ahelp ll of you to bring your final projects to
a state where you're happy with what you've done.

Bill

P.S.  Please note that there won't be any further extensions!
