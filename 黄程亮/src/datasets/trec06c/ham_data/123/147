Hi CS352-ers,

In my previous mail, the cache contents were not aligned properly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note the following about the order in which cache lines are printed
to output file.

When you have multiple invalid cache lines within a set, I choose the last
line for replacement. This is purely implementation dependent and has no
design issues. For example, initial cache status

Set Valid Tag Modified Data
0    F    0    F        0
0    F    0    F        0

Command: Load 1000

Say, address 1000 matches to index 0. Now I can load 1000 in the first line 
or the second line (since it is a two
way set associative cache. My implementation chooses the second one. Hence
the output is:

Set Valid Tag  Modified Data
0    F    0      F        0
0    T    100    F        1000


Make sure, you print the cache lines in the order that matches with the output files so
that "diff" will not give any differences.
