Hi CS352-ers,

You will be running the trace files of two SPEC benchmarks: swim and equake. 
To know more about SPEC benchmarks, visit www.spec.org. For more about the
swim and equake and their memory characteristics, check the
following links.

swim: http://www.spec.org/cpu/CFP2000/171.swim/docs/171.swim.html
equake: http://www.spec.org/cpu/CFP2000/183.equake/docs/183.equake.html

The trace files for experiments is available in the following directory:

/u/skeckler/www/cs352/project/swim.trace
/u/skeckler/www/cs352/project/equake.trace

DO NOT copy the files to your directory as each files is about 125MB. Use the above mentioned path as
input.

For example: java SimCache < /u/skeckler/www/cs352/project/swim.trace > swim.out

Madhavi
