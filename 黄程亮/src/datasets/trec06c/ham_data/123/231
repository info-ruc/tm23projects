DePolito, Lachance Chosen for NEWMAC All-Conference Softball Teams

WORCESTER, MA- Wheaton College junior captains Jessica DePolito (Taunton, 
MA/Coyle and Cassidy) and Nicole Lachance (Rochester, NH/Spaulding) earned 
spots on the New England Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) 
All-Conference softball teams at Wednesday's postseason coaches meeting at 
Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

DePolito, a second-team selection in 2005, was named to the first team, 
while Lachance corralled a spot on the second team. Lachance earned her 
first postseason honor following her first full season as a starter.

The only first baseman to be named to either all-conference team, DePolito 
finished the regular season among the top 10 in the NEWMAC in five 
offensive categories. She tied for second in triples, tied for fourth in 
home runs, was seventh in batting, tied for eighth in doubles and tied for 
ninth in RBI. She started all 38 games in which she appeared, most of which 
coming out of the cleanup spot.

As one of Wheaton's most clutch players, DePolito batted .385 with runners 
in scoring position and collected 11 two-out RBI. She had a hit in 32 of 38 
games, drove in three or more runs five times, and seven of her run-scoring 
hits either tied the game or gave Wheaton the lead. She completed the 
season with team highs in batting average (.373), slugging percentage 
(.568), on-base percentage (.413), hits (44) and RBI (22). DePolito also 
tied for first in triples (3), was second in doubles (8) and tied for third 
in bases on balls (7).

After appearing in only 39 games as an underclassman, Lachance led the 
NEWMAC in home runs (5) as the Lyons' primary shortstop this spring. Even 
with the conference tournament complete, she remains the league leader. 
Lachance was one of only two shortstops to earn all-conference recognition, 
and one of only five infielders. She also finished the regular season among 
the top 10 in the NEWMAC in each doubles, runs and steals. Four of her home 
runs came in conference play, including a pair in one game against regular 
season and tournament champion Babson College.

Wheaton's leadoff hitter provided a team-high 12 multi-hit games, including 
four three-hit efforts, and recorded eight two-out RBI. Lachance also led 
the Lyons in doubles (9), walks (11), hit-by-pitches (3) and stolen bases 
(8) while tying for first in runs (21) and placing second in batting 
average (.319), hits (37), RBI (19), slugging percentage (.543) and on-base 
percentage (.389).

The Lyons finished the spring with a 24-15 overall mark and a 9-7 record in 
the NEWMAC, tying for second in the conference standings. It was Wheaton's 
12th top-two finish in the past 13 springs. The Blue and White's season 
came to an end in the first round of the league tournament on April 25, as 
the sixth-seeded Lyons fell at number three Smith College, 1-0.
