> Sorry. For some reason the email you recieved was greatly different and
distorted than the one I sent, or at least intended to send. It left out the
first part of the message, and left that initial dollar sign in a place where
it wasn't. here's the real message. Sorry for the confusion, and thank you for
your time and help. I'll try running both to without the scramble to see if
this helps.
Dennis Tomashek

I'm having trouble with DMDX finding my files. First, I tried running a script
with wav. files, that looked like this:
<ep> <azk> <cr> < fd 100> <d 15> <t 3000> <id keyboard> <nfb> <dbc 255255255>
<dfs 36> <dwc 0> n4 s4 <eop>
$
0 "Press Space Bar to begin";
$
+ * <wav 10> “wav10"/;
-  * <wav 11> “wav 11"/;
+ * < wav 12> “wav12"/;
-  * <wav 13> “wav13"/;
$
0 "the end"
I repeatedly recieve the missing item number prompt. So then I tried running a
simple text script, just to see if I could get anything to run. It looks like
this:
<ep>  <cr>  <t 3000> <fd 200>  <d 40> <id keyboard> <dbc 255255255> <dfs 36>
<dwc 0> <vm 1024, 768, 768, 16, 0> <nfb> <n 4> <s 4> <eop>
$
0        “press the space bar to start” ;
0 <d %60> “read these and press proper button”;
$
+ 10 * “eat” /;
- 11 * “sleep”/;
+ 12 * “drink”/;
- 13 * “dream”/;
$
0 “The End”;
 $
I recieve the same message. I can't see what is wrong with these, as I've tried
a million variations on the parameter and item lines. Please help!
Thank you,
