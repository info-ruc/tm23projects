you could try to use the human speech recognition system by alternating 
every experimental trial with a dummy trial where the experimenter 
presses the left or the right key of the mouse depending on the 
participant's answer (DMDX then displays feedback according to the mouse 
press).

of course that requires an experimenter to be present (but we do that 
anyway for namming experiments) or a set up where you have the mouse and 
the loudspeakers outside the testing room
