VICTORIA ISIAND LAGOS NIGERIA

Dr. EGWU CHUKS


Dear 

First, 1 must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being . Though 1 


know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive, but I am assuring you that all 


will be well at the end of the day.

 We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed 


of your honesty and ability in a transaction of this nature. Let me first start by introducing myself properly 


to you. 

I am Dr  EGWU CHUKS, a Director with the Eco Bank Nigeria Plc., Lagos. I came to know of you in my 


private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this onfidential transaction which involves the 


transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. 

A foreigner, Late Engine STEVE MOORE, an Oil Merchant/contractor with the Federal Government of 


Nigeria, until his death a year ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at Eco Bank Plc., Lagos, and 


had a closing balance as at the end of March, 2000 worth US$28.652M (Twenty-Eight Million Six 


Hundred and Fifty-Two Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now expects a next-of-kin to 


claim as beneficiary.

 Valuable efforts has being made by the Eco Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek's family or relatives 


but there has been no success. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of 


Late Engr. STEVE MOOR next-of-kin (he had no wife nor children that is known to us),

 that the management under the influence of our Chairman and members of the Board of Directors, retired, 


requested that arrangement be made for the funds to be declared UNCLAIMABLE&quot; and subsequently 


donated to the Red Cross and the Trust Fund for the Brain Child of Mrs. Stella Obasanjo, Nigerianâs First 


Lady.

. 

In order to prevent this, some of my trusted colleagues and 1 now seek your permission to have you stand 


as a next-of-kin to Late Engr. STEVE MOORE so that the funds US$28.652M would be released and paid 


into your account as the beneficiaryâs next-of-kin. All documents to enable you get this fund will be 


carefully worked out.

 This proposal is 100% risk-free. We have agreed that, the funds be shared thus, after it must have been 


transferred into your account. 


1. 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds.

2. 10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred 


in the course of the transfer.

3. 60% to us the originators of the transaction. 


If this proposal is acceptable to you, then take advantage of the trust we have bestowed on you and your 


company, and kindly get to me immediately via Please furnish me with your most confidential telephone, 


fax number and exclusive bank/account particulars so that 1 can use these information to apply for the 


release and subsequent transfer of the funds in your favour. 

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.


Yours faithfully,


Dr. EGWU CHUKS

Director (ECO BANK PLC.)
