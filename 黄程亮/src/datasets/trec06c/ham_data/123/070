Harlow Wins Eastern College High Jump Competition During Penn Relays

PHILADELPHIA, PA- Junior Jennifer Harlow (East Bridgewater, MA/East 
Bridgewater) became the first Wheaton College track and field athlete since 
the 2002 season to win a high jump competition at the prestigious Penn 
Relays, as she cleared 5' 7 1/4" during the 112th running of the relays at 
the University of Pennsylvania's historic Franklin Field.

Dan Olson '05 captured the men's title in 2002 with a leap of 7' 1 
3/4".  Harlow edged out her closest Eastern college competitors from 
Syracuse University and Bowie State University.  Harlow's height not only 
automatically qualified her for the NCAA Division III Championship but it 
was also the third-best jump of Thursday's two flights, falling just short 
of Division I athletes from Morgan State University and the University of 
Arkansas.

Wheaton's women's 4x400-meter relay team also competed at the event, as the 
freshman quartet of Lily Calderwood (Harvard, MA/Bromfield School), Chizoba 
Ezeigwe (Brockton, MA/Thayer Academy), Natana Jules (Brooklyn, NY/Boys and 
Girls) and Christine Moreau (Lincoln, RI/Lincoln) finished third overall in 
their heat.

The Wheaton teams return to action tomorrow for the New England Women's and 
Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) Championships at Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT).  The women are aiming for their ninth straight 
conference title.
