Hi FGP seminar,

As I mentioned yesterday, next week we'll have in-class project 
presentations.  I am really looking forward to seeing what all
of you have done for your projects.

Each group will have a 15 minute slot.
You should plan on using 8-10 minutes *maximum* for your
pre-prepared presentation.  That will leave plenty of
time for questions.

Your presentation should explain:
   - what problem you're attacking, and why it's important
   - how your work relates to other ideas/research
     (keep this brief, due to time constraints)
   - your basic approach
   - your results
   - discussion/conclusion.
     In particular, what interesting things did you learn?
     What surprised you?
     Is this line of work worth continuing, and if so, how?

I will supply the snacks for the last class, so you just
need to show up with your presentation.

I will draw names from a hat or come up with some other
scheduling algorithm by Friday.  You should be ready to
go at the start of class!  If you have schedule constraints,
please send me an email to tell me what they are, even
if you've done so before.

Good luck with the home stretch,

Bill
