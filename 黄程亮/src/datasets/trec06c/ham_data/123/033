Dear friends,

=20

Perhaps this is an old topic but I've just thought of the question that
whether micro credit is as an income-smoothing or an investment =
instrument.
As you may be aware of, economists seem to assume that micro borrowers =
have
"projects" which may earn income for their repayment. The distinction of
risk versus safe type of borrowers also depends on the type of projects.
This approach is then widely used to build models which explain e.g. why
group lending can be used to overcome market imperfection .etc. While I =
am
not concerned with how useful those models are, I am concerned with the =
fact
that most successful micro lending models are with regular savings and
weekly installment repayment. This implies that micro borrowers must =
have a
source of income, or at the least, it implies that micro credit as an
investment instrument is hard to be the case of success (because if it =
is,
we may expect the repayment at a later point in time). Hence, if micro
credit is mainly for income smoothing, how economic models (e.g. group
lending) would be changed?=20

=20

Just a random thought - please correct me if I misunderstand somewhere.

Cheers,

Quach
