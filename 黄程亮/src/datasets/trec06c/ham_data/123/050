and Western Australia.

=93NAB is committed to backing people through the delivery of a range of=20
financial services,=94 NAB CEO Australia Ahmed Fahour said.

=93We believe it is important to back customers not simply bank them.=20
There is an obligation on us to make sure we extend this to include=20
individuals and families who have the aspiration, but for whatever=20
reason, not the luck,=94 he said.
