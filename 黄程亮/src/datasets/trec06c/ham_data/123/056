  Subject: Devfinance: Microfiance for income smoothing or invetsemnt =
instrument?


  Dear friends,



  Perhaps this is an old topic but I've just thought of the question =
that whether micro credit is as an income-smoothing or an investment =
instrument. As you may be aware of, economists seem to assume that micro =
borrowers have "projects" which may earn income for their repayment. The =
distinction of risk versus safe type of borrowers also depends on the =
type of projects. This approach is then widely used to build models =
which explain e.g. why group lending can be used to overcome market =
imperfection .etc. While I am not concerned with how useful those models =
are, I am concerned with the fact that most successful micro lending =
models are with regular savings and weekly installment repayment. This =
implies that micro borrowers must have a source of income, or at the =
least, it implies that micro credit as an investment instrument is hard =
to be the case of success (because if it is, we may expect the repayment =
at a later point in time). Hence, if micro credit is mainly for income =
smoothing, how economic models (e.g. group lending) would be changed?=20



  Just a random thought - please correct me if I misunderstand =
somewhere.

  Cheers,

  Quach
