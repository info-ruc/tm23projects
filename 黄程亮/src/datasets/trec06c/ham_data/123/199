Six Wheaton Players Earn All-Conference Men's Tennis Nods

WORCESTER, MA- Six Wheaton College men's tennis players earned New England 
Women's and Men's Athletic Conference (NEWMAC) All-Conference citations at 
Tuesday's postseason meeting at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).

Seniors Nick Potter (Concord, NH/Concord) and Matt Sheers (Beacon, 
NY/Beacon), juniors Brian Danishevsky (Hamden, CT/Hamden Hall Country Day 
School), Brad Dressler (Cranston, RI/Cranston West) and Payum Payman 
(Pleasant Valley, NY/Arlington), and sophomore Sean Daly (Miami, FL/La 
Salle) each earned accolades.

As Wheaton's third doubles tandem, Potter and Sheers corralled a first team 
nod after having not played a match together until this season. The duo 
went 6-2 overall, including 3-0 in NEWMAC action. Potter was also named to 
the first team in doubles in 2004 and earned a doubles team spot for the 
third straight season. For his play this spring at fifth singles, Potter 
landed on the second team after going 14-8 overall, including 7-1 in the 
number-five slot, and winning four of five NEWMAC matches.

Payman, Daly, Danishevsky and Dressler rounded out Wheaton's second team 
singles honors, receiving recognition for their play at the first through 
fourth slots, respectively. Payman and Daly combined for a second team 
placement at first doubles, while Danishevsky and Dressler nabbed a second 
team nod at number two.

This season marked Payman's third straight on the NEWMAC's second team at 
first singles, as he went 18-5 overall with a 3-1 mark in league play, 
losing only to the conference player of the year from Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology (MIT). Daly was 12-7 this year with a 4-1 NEWMAC 
record. In doubles play, Daly and Payman went 9-6, including 3-1 in the 
conference.

Danishevsky landed his third all-conference award for singles, going 10-8 
overall and 3-1 in the NEWMAC. At third singles, he recorded an 8-5 mark. 
Dressler, who picked up his second all-conference singles nod, went 12-6, 
including 6-1 from the fourth spot, while he and Danishevsky earned their 
first all-conference doubles selections. The tandem went 12-6 overall, 
including 8-5 at the second spot. Going 3-1 in the league, the pair 
outscored opponents, 29-13.

Nationally-ranked Wheaton finished the year 11-6 overall and 4-1 in the 
NEWMAC. The Lyons, who are 25th in the latest Intercollegiate Tennis 
Association (ITA) rankings, saw their season come to an end over the 
weekend with a loss in the championship match of the conference tournament. 
The second-seeded Blue and White fell to number one MIT, 4-1.
