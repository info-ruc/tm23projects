Hello everybody,

i am trying to create an experiment with DMDX which would be able to provide
positive or negative feedbacks as the subject says the right or wrong color of
the word displayed on screen.
I found a software called 'Dragon Naturally Speaking' which can run as a
background task and translate spoken words such as 'blue','red','green' into key
strokes such as 'r', 'g', 'b' (a useful precision is that Dragon Nat. Speak.
also exists with a french dictionnary ...)

My idea is to use a pair of items for each trial :
First item : DMDX displays a coloured word  (e.g. the word 'Dog' written in red)
on the screen and waits for a audio input from the microphone. The subject says
something (e.g. 'red'), DMDX records the response time and jump to the second item.
Second item : DMDX displays nothing on the screen and is waiting for a key
stroke. In that time, the word formerly spoken (e.g. 'red') is translated by
Dragon Nat. Speak. in a key stroke : it takes approximatively 1 or 2 seconds.
DMDX records the answer and, depending on the key pressed (in fact, the key that
the speech recognition provides to the running application on Windows) , DMDX
displays positive or negative feedback...

A big problem is that when the subject goes on talking when the second item is
waiting for a key to be pressed , DMDX considers the audio input as a positive
answer and sometimes displays the correct feedback for a non-correct answer.

I have the following questions on DMDX :
- is it possible to map audio input with 'requests' (neutral answer from the
subject, like the 'spacebar' key stroke waited with a '0' numbered item for
example) or to unmap audio input for some items only.

I would also like to know if some of you, in psychological researches, have
already used DMDX or others softwares to create such experiments with speech
recognition and feedbacks. Maybe this is not an experiment with scientifical
precision, because Dragon Nat. Speak., spending many times on processing spoken
words, can cause errors in timing (... maybe stroop tasks with speech
recognition can only exist in my dreams !) The most important to me, for the
moment, is to display correct feedbacks.

Thank you for your answers.
