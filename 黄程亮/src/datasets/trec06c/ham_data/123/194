Hi CS352-ers,

There were many questions about the arguments for specifying the 
input and output file.
Here is the deal:

1) Command to run the cache simulator:

   java SimCache -cap 4 -assoc 2 -block 8 -input trace1 -output t1.c1

Name of the file: SimCache (not Main)

Input and output file: Please add -input and -output arguments to your 
command line.

NOTE: The default
arguments are stdin and stdout in which case, the reader will be
initialized to "System.in" and "System.out". Do not worry if you don't get
the stdin and stdout working. The programs will be tested with some input
and output files given as command line argument.

I am sorry about couple of inconsistent mails about the input/output
options.

2) All the ways in a set are treated equal. So, the order in which you
choose a invalid block for replacement shouldn't matter. The same holds
for the order in which you print the different ways of a set. In the
sample output files, the ways are printed in a particular order. Let me know if you
get the correct results but different order. We can resolve it.

3) One advice to students who do not have a complete implementation. Make
sure you have the base case working and build more functionalities (like various capacities,
various values for associativity, block sizes, LRU with 2 ways, 4 ways etc). The grading policy will be
incremental in the sense, we will test the functionality incrementally.
Also, write a note on your report about the set you got to work and not
got to work(if possible with reasons).

Please find all the information in FAQ.
