Having just discovered Cmap Tools, I was eager to try it on=20
my Tablet PC.  Alas, the double click by the pen is not=20
recognized.  I can use the pen to right click and get menus, but=20
I cannot change the focus by clicking in a box, etc. =20

Pen support would make this a great tablet pc tool. I am not=20
sure it is a Java problem, since I have Java software that works=20
fine on the slate. =20

Would it be a big project to make Cmap Tools pen-enabled?

Cordially,
Jim Ventola =20
