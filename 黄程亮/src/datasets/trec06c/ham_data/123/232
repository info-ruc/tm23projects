CS352-ers,

The project is due tomorrow, Thursday May 3. As you recall, assignments 
are normally due in class and assignments turned in after class are 
late. Since I really would like you all to attend class tomorrow, here 
is what I will do:

- *If* you attend class tomorrow, you may turn in the project until 
tomorrow at 5pm without any late penalty.
- If you do not attend class tomorrow and you turn in your project 
after 9:30am, then it will be subject to the late day policy.

In addition, we may have a final quiz tomorrow (don't worry - it will 
be easy).

I am arranging a room for the review session, currently scheduled for 
Monday May 8 at 3pm.  I'll get back to you on the location.

I also expect to announce the location of the final exam shortly.

Cheers,

Steve Keckler                                        Computer
