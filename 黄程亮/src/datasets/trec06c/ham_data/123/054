Foreword

The era of open access is dawning and it could not come a moment too soon. 
The rapid development of the internet and its increased use across the 
globe has meant that there is a wide and growing audience that is hungry 
and in some cases, desperately in need of information that traditionally 
few have been able to access.

The idea of open access is highly controversial and divisive. If one were 
to politely mumble the phrase at a dull gathering of academics, publishers 
and policy makers, one would be sure to instantly divide the room and 
instigate a heated debate. This book is therefore an important introduction 
for those who know nothing of a debate that has been raging in academic 
circles for a long time. And for those with seemingly entrenched positions, 
this book will most certainly change some minds.

In science, my own area of expertise, the issue of open access has been 
making troublesome waves in the last few years. The 2004 House of Commons 
Science and Technology Committee inquiry 'Scientific Publications: free for 
all?' which I chaired, looked into a number of issues; such as whether the 
market for scientific publications was working well, the trends in journal 
pricing, the impact of new publishing trends on the scientific process, the 
integrity of journals and so on. What we found was not pleasant.

The commercial publishing world has an increasingly harmful monopoly on a 
number of prestige journals which are essential to disseminating new ideas 
and research. This monopoly over knowledge has been one factor underlying 
an increase in the price of subscriptions, leaving some academic libraries 
with no choice but to cancel subscriptions as they can no longer afford to 
pay for a full range of journals.

I believe the current situation is highly unethical. As vast amounts of 
public money is used to fund research, it should follow that such research 
should be freely available to the public to boost up their knowledge and 
appreciation of science, instead of increasing the profit margins of a few 
publishing houses. One therefore would be hard pressed to deny the ethical 
case for open access. Indeed one only has to think of the need to make new 
research readily available to developing countries which do not have the 
resources to purchase such information and yet face some of the world's 
most devastating problems.

However, better ethical conduct is only one of the many objectives of the 
open access project as this excellent collection of essays will show. I do 
not deny that there are legitimate fears about the implications of open 
access. It is one thing to make information readily available for the 
public who through taxation fund such research, and developing countries 
who need access to life-saving ideas; but it is quite another matter to 
make knowledge available for those who will free ride their way through 
improved access to profit themselves. But these are problems I believe can 
be overcome with a bit of creativity as some of the authors in this 
collection show. Turn the page and start reading.
