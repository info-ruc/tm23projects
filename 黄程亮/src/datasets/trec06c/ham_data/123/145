I suggest the following for the output format .(Note: java5 supports
System.out.printf where the formatting is similar to C)

Cache contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

for ( set = 0; set < nsets; set++)
     for( a =0 ; a < assoc; a ++)
     {
         System.out.printf(""%5d %c %6x %c\t",set, valid, tag, modified);
         for( i = 0; i < words_per_block; i++)
             System.out.printf("%08x\t", word[i]);
     }

Example:
CACHE CONTENTS:
     0 T     26 T        00009800        00009804
     0 T      0 T        00000000        00000004
     1 T      1 T        0000040b        0000040c
     1 T      6 T        00001808        0000180c


Main memory
~~~~~~~~~~~

for( ....)
{
     System.out.printf("%5x: ", address);
     for(jj = 0; jj < 8; jj++)
         System.out.printf("%08x  ", Mem[..]);
}

Example:

  1000: 00001000  00001004  00001008  0000100c  00001010  00001014  00001018  0000101c
  1020: 00001023  00001026  00001028  0000102c  00001030  00001034  00001038  0000103e
  1040: 00001040  00001044  00001048  0000104c  00001050  00001054  0000105a  0000105c

I will update the output files to reflect this format.

Also note the following about the order in which cache lines are printed
to output file.

When you have multiple invalid cache lines within a set, I choose the last
line for replacement. This is purely implementation dependent and has no
design issues. For example, initial cache status

Set Valid Tag Modified Data
0    F    0    F        0 
0    F    0    F        0

Command: Load 1000

Say, address 1000 matches to index 0. Now I can load 1000 in the first line 
or the second line (since it is a two
way set associative cache. My implementation chooses the second one. Hence
the output is:

Set Valid Tag  Modified Data
0    F    0      F        0 
0    T    100    F        1000


Make sure, you print the cache lines in the order that matches with the 
output files so
that "diff" will not give any differences.
