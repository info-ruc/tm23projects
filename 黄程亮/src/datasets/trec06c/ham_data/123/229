   You have mismatched scramble dollar signs.  Normally it would pick that 
up but it hasn't here (possibly due to the last character in the file being 
a dollar sign) and when scramble looses it it can do some pretty weird 
things.  A look at scrambled.txt will show where the DMDX error is coming 
from but you need to remove the first dollar sign before the parameters.
