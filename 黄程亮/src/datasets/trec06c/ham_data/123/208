This mail might come to you as a surprise and the temptation to ignore it as 
unserious could come into your mind; but please consider it a divine wish 
and accept it with a deep sense of humility. My name is AMIN AL-SHARANI from 
Dubai (United Arab Emirate). I was formerly living in Cuba where I served as 
a contractor under Castro`s government but had to run into self exile after 
the ruling Government of Fidel Castro closed in on my family on accusations 
of anti-government activities and statements, I was once married with two 
children but my family escaped to Indonesia where they finally became 
victims of the tsunami disaster. Actually l did made a lot of money while 
serving under Castro Government and on getting to UAE, I became a merchant 
here in Dubai dealing in Ornamentals, Oriental Carpets and Artifacts and 
life was very smooth for me until about three(3) years ago when I was first 
diagnosed of Cancer of the Larynx.

Before this happened my business and concern for making money was all I 
lived for, I never really cared about other values in life. But since the 
loss of my family and hometown coupled with my ailment I have found a new 
desire to assist helpless families. I have been helping orphans in 
orphanage/motherless homes. I have once donated some money to orphans in war 
ravaged Eritrea, Somalia, Sudan and some East European Countries. Before I 
became ill, I deposited twenty four million dollars($24,000 000.OO) in a 
long-term deposit vault of a security/finance company in Europe and I didn`t 
state any new TRUSTEE / BENEFICIARY after the lost of my entire family when 
the money was deposited and if I died without stating any the money will 
automatically go into the coffers of the security company and I don`t want 
this to happen. I have left the hospital and presently receiving treatment 
in an acupuncture clinic, I have been undergoing treatment for Oesophageal 
Cancer at the hospital. I have since lost my ability to talk clearly and my 
doctors have told me that I have only a few months to live. It is my last 
wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations and victims of 
natural disasters.

Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my 
illness, I cannot live with the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility 
to any of them. Please, I beg you in the name of God to help me process 
these deposit and distribute it amongst charity organizations and do use 
your judgement to distribute the money.

Please send me an email to indicate your willingness to assist me in this 
disbursement.I have set aside 30% for you for your time and patience.

I await to hear from you, may God be with you and your entire family.

Remain blessed.
Mr. Amin Al-Sharani
