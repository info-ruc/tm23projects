IBScientific is open access publisher that aims to provide the developing 
world with tools to publish. This is  not-for profit (charitable) 
organisation that has achieved some success since its launch ( July the 
05th, 2005):

* IBScientific magazine: (ISSN 1751-0716)aimed at public understand of 
multidisciplinary academic issue, and providing non-expert overviews of 
research problems to facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations. see: 
<http://www.ibscientific.net/>http://www.ibscientific.net/

* IBS Journal of Science: (ISSN 1751-0724)aimed at promoting and providing 
the developing world with the exposure necessary for its growth, and the 
vitality needed for its research resources by publishing original research 
articles. see 
<http://www.ibscientific.net/journal/index.php/oj>http://www.ibscientific.net/journal/index.php/oj

All our publications are peer reviewed and registered as journals.This 
initiative has taken Algeria as a case for proof of concept and has 
attracted the attention of both academics and policy makers.

We are also launching a collaboration gateway, to harbor science 
peer-to-peer communication. This project also serve the scientific 
community in large and has received some support from UK researchers.

Our nine month life so far has been very exciting and our growth has prompt 
us to organise a conference to improve awareness of the open access model 
and its role in future science publishing (see:
<http://www.ibscientific.net/conference/Home.htm>http://www.ibscientific.net/conference/Home.htm 
Sponsoring need to be finalised), and we would like to draw your attention 
to this initiative. (The conference date is the 8th of July 2006, in London 
(UK))

Yours,
Kindest regards
