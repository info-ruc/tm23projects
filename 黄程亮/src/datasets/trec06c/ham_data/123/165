SONY:

The document discusses the evolution of copyright law in the context  
of technological devices including P2P networks.  It was in the  
historic Sony Betamax case where Sony was eventually found not liable  
for copyright infringing actions by users of their product because  
their product had "substantial noninfringing use" and they did not  
directly contribute to or encourage such actions.  At this time it  
was also questionable as to whether the use of the VTR for time- 
shifting of media was in fact fair use of the broadcast.  Since some  
stations expressly authorized time-shifting, it was found that the  
VTR has substantial noninfringing uses and Sony was not held liable.

In the case of Napster, it was found that Napster contributed to  
infringement by indexing copyrighted works and not blocking their  
transfer.  In Grokster, the decentralized structure of the network  
meant that the software authors had not the ability to control the  
network nor did they directly supply copyrighted works and so were  
initially not held liable.  This decision was somewhat overturned  
later by the Supreme Court when they found that infringement was  
essentially promoted by Grokster.

The paper illuminates a pivotal element in copyright law:  How to  
balance the rights of the owner and the consumers of the media.  I  
was very much surprised to find that time-shifting may have been  
ruled non fair use of the VTR.  It seems similar to me to ask the  
audience at a circus not to remember what they had seen or describe  
the performance in any way to others after having left.  Once  
something has been broadcast, it seems difficult to me that a  
television station can claim that they retain any ownership of it.   
It this similar strain of thinking, my tendency is that the authors  
of a P2P software can only be held liable for infringement if they  
actively promote infringement.  Whether the authors know infringement  
occurs, or the fraction of infringing use does not seem an important  
factor to me.  It is well know that guns can be used for murder, and  
it is well known that deer do not wear bullet proof vests.  Yet, gun  
manufacturers are not considered to be inducing murder by selling  
armor piercing bullets.
