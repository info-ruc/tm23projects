Subject: [FGP] comments on mid-project writeups are done

Hi FGP-ers,

I've read and commented on the mid-project writeups.
In about 10 minutes (by 10:45am), they'll be available in the
wooden bins next to my office door.  I'd encourage you to
pick them up as soon as possible so that you can consider
comments I made as you finish your projects.  In most cases
I think that you'll have time to consider my comments even
though they're a bit late.

The writeups are graded as check-, check, check+.

The final project grades will be letter grades, but I decided
that for the mid-project writeups the simpler system was
better.

Bill
