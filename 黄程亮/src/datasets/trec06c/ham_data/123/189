Hi,
I thank you for your help again, but I am still getting the same message:
Directx reports no support for Page Flipping. The video card in this
> >machine is not adequate for DMDX'x purposes".
I have already removed the video card and installed it again, I have
updated directx, and nvidia video driver. Since things remained the
same I tried changind the video card, but unfortunately I keep
receiving the same message.
I have a Intel Pentium 4, 80G HD and 512 RAM, and I am using windows
2000. Does anybody have any idea about what is going wrong? I thank
you very much in advance.
Maria Luiza
