Somebody on this mailing list (I forgot who) has a web page
that says the IR receiver module (38kHz, side-look) from
Digikey (www.digikey.com), part no. 160-1153-ND, is pretty much
identical to the part listed in the HB Tech. Ref.

I bought one, but I haven't tried it yet. According to the
instructions I saw, it's supposed to be wired up like so:
    -------------
   |             |
   |     IR      |
   |   module    |
   |             |
    -------------
  gnd|    |V+  |signal
     /    |    |
    /     |    |
   /    + |    |
   o--)|--o    |
   | 47uF |    |
   |      \    |
   |    47/    |
   |   ohm\    |
   |      /    |
   |      |    |
 -----    |    |
  ---    +5V   signal
   -  

I haven't even reviewed the HB schematics yet to determine
whether the capacitor and the resistor are already part of the
HB circuit. Anyway, I hope this helps.
