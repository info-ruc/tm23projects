Hi jonathon,
   the problem we came across was that on running  timedx for the 
first time you get a choice of video drivers, the selected item being 
2 which is the external [but not activated] monitor. Subsequently 
running timedx produced an error. Fixing an external monitor and 
activating this allowed the video driver to be reset but in the field 
an experimenter may not have this luxury.

Our problem was due to user error [mine while setting up the machine] 
but it would be nice if there was an escape route!

thanks

iain
