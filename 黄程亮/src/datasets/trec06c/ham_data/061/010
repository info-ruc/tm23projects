I am using 8-NiMH-AA-cells, 1100 mAh each, without any problems.
For German Handyboard users: www.reichelt.de sells either single
sells or a soldered pack of batteries. Actually you can even get 
upto 1700 mAh-cells (no experience with those cells). Instead of
using the recommended 500mA DC adapter, I changed to 800mA.

Same motors are used by me and I geared them down, too.

No problems with single sells.

Hope this helps.
