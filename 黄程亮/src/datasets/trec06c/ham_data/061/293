Hi all,

   I had a handyboard and an expansion board, they do not work together. I had
definitely unzipped the explib into the libs directory and overwrote the files
it need. But a strange problem occurs, when the board is downloading files at
expsenc.c and hb_lib.icb, it said "analog already defined", "digital already
defined" and "raw_analog already defined".

   I had try that to use the handyboard only with its own files, it works
pretty good. But when work with exp board and exp files, the problem occurs. I
had brorrowed an exp board from my friend, the same problem occur.

   My question is do anyone know what had happened on my boards? It seems that
there is no problem on the exp board, I think the problem is on handyboard, is
there any components burnt?? And what can I do with the boards???

Thank you very much
