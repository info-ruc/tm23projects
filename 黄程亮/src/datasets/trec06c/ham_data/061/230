Backlighting is a "no issue" for most of our usage.  I have used all but the
40x1 displays from BG and they all work fine.  If there is a 44780 on the board,
you can use it.  Does _anyone_ make an LCD that isn't 44780 compatable anyway?

  I built up a couple of their PIC-n-LCD units using the 20x4, one with their
board and one with my own using their chip/crystal kit.  These work very nicely
with just about every micro I've tried them with.

have fun,
DLC
