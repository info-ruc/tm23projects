Hi, I`m working in my mobile robot and a have a lot of questions, here there 
are some:

1. I need to communicate the HB with mi PC all the time during the execution 
of the HB main program, How can I do this? Through the SPI or the computer 
conector (I/O Interface)? and where I can find a programming guide to use 
serial communication with the HB?

2. I have not found the L293D motor drivers, What replace can I use?

3. How can I connect four polaroid sonars to my HB? I Know how connect one, 
what do I have to make?

Thanks
JULIAN
