I figured it out either from the Handyboard web pages at MIT or from the
big pink book (Motorola HC11 Book).  I have had my Handyboard receiving
from a GPS and tranmitting to a TNC at 4800 baud.  Initially did it with
IC, but am now using GCC for my code.  You can just poke a value into one
of the HC11 registers to change the baud rate.
