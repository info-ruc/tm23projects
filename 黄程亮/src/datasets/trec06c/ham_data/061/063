Maybe somebody could help.
I am try to use the IR output. the problem is that the HB is modulating the
signal at 41kHz and I need to get it down to 38kHz.
I have checked the resistor and capacitor used in generating the frequency.

R =3D 3.81 K
C =3D 0.0068uF
f =3D 1/(3.81k)(.0068uF) =3D 38.5981kHz

at least in theory.=20

When I run the command poke(0x1000, 0x40); as Fred suggests in the test
procedures I get about 43kHz at the output of U9-Pin 2(hex inverter)
Which is high compared to the suggested output. (39k - 40k)Hz
I am really trying to avoid replacing the res. and cap.
I was wondering if anybody else had a problem with their IR output.
If so could you let me know your experience. I am baffled as to why there
is such a difference from theory to actual.
I have been through the HB archives and cannot find a thing. So any help at
all is welcomed and appreciated.

Best regards,

Fred Martin
