Hey all..

I got my handyboard a few days ago.. and I have some questions..

1) What is a good battery to use?  I don't have 8 nicad batteries.. I use a 
R/C car 9.6V battery pack..  is there some specific need for certian mAh 
values?

2)What method did you use to attach it to the board (I have the 
RobotstoreHK one)  I ended up using two 18 gauge wires with bannana plugs 
at the end.. and the corresponding plugs on the batterypack

3)Anybody have examples of the IC code I can see?  i can use the one line 
inputs to check, say, the status of a digital input (bump sensor) but when 
i write a simple program to sound the buzzer if it hits.. it doesn't work..

Examples would be great!

4) Any good sources on building remote control interfaces?  I would like to 
have a home built transmitter with a few joysticks and buttons.. any 
sources?

Thanks all

-Eric
