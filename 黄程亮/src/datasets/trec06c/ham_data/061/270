DMDX timing problems


- ooh, just got your mail message.  Problems with DMDX relate to the
playing of one sound file followed by another.  I have a solution that
involves concatenating multiple sound files into one.  It is fairly easy.
 I shall call you about this.


Morph stuff.  Since I am not going swimming I shall do this at 5 and mail
you the results.


Love
