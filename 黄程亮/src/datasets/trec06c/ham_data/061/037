I bought a handyboard for my Thesis to do some data aquisition....now that I
am done and out in the working world I don't think I am going to need it
anytime soon.  (Unless I go for my Phd :) )

Anyway, it is fully assembled and works fine.  Comes with all the cables,
charger/interface box, charger power supply, and Fully licensed Interactive C.

I have all the original papers and I am the only one who used it...it is in
great shape.

Anyone need one for a project?

Pat.
