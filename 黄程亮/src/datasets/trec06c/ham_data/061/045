I've had great success using Hall-effect magnetic sensors as
shaft encoders with the Handy Board. The sensors are the type
that Patrick Hui (of the Robot Store HK) includes in his HB
sensor kit.

I glued small disk magnets into the holes in a pair of Lego
pulleys on the robot axle shafts and mounted the Hall-effect
sensors about a millimeter away from the sides of the pulleys.
This worked ok, but I only got a few encoder counts per
rotation of the wheel. To get more clicks, I geared the pulleys
up, and now I get about one click per centimeter of travel,
which is more than adequate to keep the robot tracking in a
straight line.

The Hall-effect magnetic sensors plug right into the HB and
work just fine with the shaft encoder routines that I
downloaded off the HB web site. They give analog readings from
about 130 to 150 (or if you flip the magnets over, 150 to 170)
so you need to set the encoder thresholds accordingly. Make
sure that all the magnets in a pulley have the same polarity
before you glue 'em.
