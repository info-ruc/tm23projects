Hi everyone!

The RF tx/rx units shown on the page were from Ming Microsystems.  They
were rated for 1200 baud, but I've been able to transmit/receive slower
using the Parallax Inc. RF boards, which were rated for 300 baud.  For
slower serial communication, you can set the Baud-rate control register
(BAUD 102B) to an appropriate value based on the info from the 68HC11 pink
book (Part #M68HC11RM/AD, available from Motorola for free).  For example:

 poke(0x3c, 1);     /*Disable pcode character receive mode*/ 
 poke(0x102b,0x33);         /*Set serial baud rate to 1200*/ 

BTW, my homepage address has moved to:

Good luck,
