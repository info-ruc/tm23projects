Aloha Christopher,
I work for an Executive Search Firm in Honolulu and have a few clients =
who are interested in potential candidates who have a background in C++ =
programming.  This would be in a SUN/UNIX environment and all the =
applications are in signal processing, neural networks and expert =
systems.  Applicants must be able to translate algorithms into code.  =
I'm writing to you in hopes that you are familiar with a few students =
who are terrific in this and would welcome an opportunity to live in =
Hawaii.  The weather here is great, so is the surf.  For someone with =
1-2 years of experience, the salary is about 60K.  Please pass this =
along and encourage those so inclined to check out our web page and =
contact me with their resumes. Thanks for your time.
Aloha,
Debi Balmilero
