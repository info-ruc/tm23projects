Hello 9fans!

I am in trouble.
Starting b.com from fd fails on some PCs and not on other PCs.
that is,
	A> b fd!0!9pcdisk
for example, fails to detect 9pcdisk on fd.
One of the differences among my PCs is MPU.
It seems to me that PCs with K6-2 cannot
detect 9pcdisk on fd.

If you have PCs with K6-2 or highter, please try to boot
from fd and report the results to me.
