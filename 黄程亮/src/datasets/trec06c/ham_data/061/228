I am using motor port 0 to control a lego motor (gearmotor #5225) The =
problem I am having is that I cannot seem to change the motor speed =
using motor(0, speed) where speed is between -100 & 100. The motor turns =
on at 15 (or -15), but sstays at the same speed throughout the reamiaing =
power levels.=20

I have tried this with a motor out of a CD-ROM drive (eject motor - =
sanyo) and it works fine. Is there omething special anbout the lego =
motor I need to be aware of?
