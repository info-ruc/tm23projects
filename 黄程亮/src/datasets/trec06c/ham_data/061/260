Hello 9fans,

I received a mail from Jim.
His patch to:
	/sys/src/9/pc/clock.c
	/sys/src/fs/pc/8253.c
fixed the problem with the CPU speed being unsteady.

Thanks Jim.

Here's something which might fix your problem with the CPU speed
being unsteady. This code is from our current fileserver kernel and goes
in 8253.c/clockinit:

	...
	/*
	 *  set clock for 1/HZ seconds
	 */
	outb(Tmode, Load0|Square);
	outb(T0cntr, (Freq/HZ));	/* low byte */
	outb(T0cntr, (Freq/HZ)>>8);	/* high byte */

	/*
	 * Introduce a little delay to make sure the count is
	 * latched and the timer is counting down; with a fast
	 * enough processor this may not be the case.
	 * The i8254 (which this probably is) has a read-back
	 * command which can be used to make sure the counting
	 * register has been written into the counting element.
	 */
	x = (Freq/HZ);
	for(loops = 0; loops < 100000 && x >= (Freq/HZ); loops++){
		outb(Tmode, Latch0);
		x = inb(T0cntr);
		x |= inb(T0cntr)<<8;
	}

	/* find biggest loop that doesn't wrap */
	...

I admit to not having tried this on a non-Intel processor. The delay is
also necessary in the terminal/cpuserver kernels.
If that fixes your problem, let me know and feel free to post the fix
to 9fans.

By the way, the x86amd[] table values for the Athlon are the same as
for the K6:
	{ 6,	1,	11,	"AMD-Athlon", },/* trial and error */
	{ 6,	2,	11,	"AMD-Athlon", },/* trial and error */
I have a 700MHz Athlon with an ASUS K7M motherboard; it's quite refreshing
to see not a single Intel chip in the system.
