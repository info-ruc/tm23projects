Hi,
A more recent version of the web page contains versions of the software for 2,
4, or 6 GP2D02's as well as the Excel spreadsheet to convert the output of the
device to centimeters. The page can be found at:

http://www.salesworkbench.com:48331/GP2D02/GP2D02_1.html

I'm not sure what the problem is when you download the ICB file.  I've
downloaded it a number of times with no problem.  In particular, I can't see
how the name gets converted from GP2D02_I.icb to GP2D02_I_icb.htm.  I use
Netscape browsers and when you do a 'Save AS' it will leave the suffix
unchanged.  Apparently your browser is trying to rename it to an HTML file.

I hope you have more success this time.  Good luck.

Barry
