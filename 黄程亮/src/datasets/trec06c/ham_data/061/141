hi 
i want to send a byte as a series of bit to a transamitter module i am
using. the FAQ says i can use the digital 9, or SPI port or TOC3. i can
output to these ports. 

the first problem is getting the delay times between bits. if i use the
msleep() function i can get up to 1000 baud right? but i want to use a
standard bitrate 1200baud. since argument to msleep() is an integer how can
i do this? 

the other question is in the code i have to write separate lines that sets
and clears the output with respect to the byte. for example i used the ode
as below using the TOC3 output.

.
.
bit_set(0x1000, 0x20);	/* mark*/
msleep(9l);             for bit rate of 110baud
bit_set(0x1000, 0x20);
msleep(9l);
bit_set(0x1000, 0x20);
msleep(9l);
.
.


is there an easier way of doing this?

many thanks
M Fazal
