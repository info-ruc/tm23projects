The 3.81K resistor is probably more accurate than its 
rated 1%, but the capacitor may be much less precise, 
unless you got a tight tolerance metal film one,
(as I think the part list specifies).
Precision also relies on the thresholds of the Schmitt trigger
CMOS gate. These may usually be very tight, but they aren't guaranteed.
Easiest cheap thing to do is to increase the R value based on your
measurements.
The closest 1% value to 41/38 * 3.81K is 4.12K
