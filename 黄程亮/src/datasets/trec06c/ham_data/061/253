  It means that when TimeDX asked to blit a portion of the next screen
(called a broken blit because instead of one great big blit of the whole
screen it's broken into smaller chunks so the machine can do other things
at the same time) it failed.  Reasons for this are legion and I'm not sure
TimeDX's tachistoscopic acid test has all the smarts that DMDX's routines
have.  Try DMDX with some display intensive item files (TachTest.rtf from
the demo is a good one), if it doesn't fail then the machine is likely to
be fine.
