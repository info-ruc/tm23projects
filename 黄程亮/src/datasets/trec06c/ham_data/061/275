While  playing with u9fs and 9p I ask myself: Is there are any good reason that
each R-message contains fid ? I take a look at u9fs sources and have found 
that R-messages have exactly the same fid as T-messages. Is this a common
behavior and if yes, why do we need fids in R-messages at all ?

Thanks,
Roman.
