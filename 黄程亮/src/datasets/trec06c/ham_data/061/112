Hi,
I am using IC. In my program I have an array of char (char
serial_get_buffer[256]) as a global variable.
This variable is used in a function. I want that when ever this function is
called the array should be initialized to NULL. I tried following statement
which did not work.

for(i=0;i<256;i++)
   serial_get_buffer[i]="\0";

My second question is that RUN TIME ERROR 03, is only related to "array out
of bound" or related to any other error as well.

Any suggestion and guidance please.



Kind Regards,
Javaid Iqbal
