Hi.. does anyone know how to interface GP1u58X or IS1u60 Sharp IR sensor with
handboard ?? i've tired to hack the GP1u58X from digital to analog output and
plug it into analog input of HB, but the result is not good.. is there any
software which can interface with these sensors directly ?? Besides can anyone
can give suggestion of any analog IR sensor ?? since my project will over
budget soon.. thanks..
