I suppose that maybe your NiCd cells are just nearing the end
of their useful life. Either that, or you have a wiring problem
somewhere in the power circuit. Also, it's generally not a good
idea to mix different types of cells (different capacities) in
one battery pack.

I power my HB with an 8-AA-cell, 500 mAH Panasonic battery,
soldered together by Digikey (I think it's the one listed in
the HB Tech Ref) and it has no trouble at all driving a couple
Lego motors. My robot is pretty heavy, too, with sonar, a color
video camera, and a video transmitter.

However, I'm using the Lego gear motors, which may be more
efficient than the old style of Lego motor, and I gear them
down even more. Have you tried gearing your motors down? Maybe
you aren't getting enough torque and that's causing your motors
to stall.

I really recommend getting the soldered batteries from Digikey.
Using a battery holder with single cells never worked very
reliably for me. You can get soldered packs made up of 800 mAH
cells now, too. Best of luck!
