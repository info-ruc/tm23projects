Hi everybody
  I'm trying to find an encoder to work with my Handy Board(using a DC
motor). Please help me if you know anything about Shaft encoder(S1
optical encoder)interfacing with Handy Board. Can i use the Shaft
encoder? Do you know how to connect the Shaft encoder with Handy Board?
Can i use the Shaft encoder? Do you know how to connect the Shaft
