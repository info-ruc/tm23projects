Hi,
Being on the BEAM robotics list for ages i realise how annoying it is to =
have newbies coming in and you having to explain things all over again, =
but i just can't find the info i'm looking for so here goes...
=20
I've found most parts, but there a few problems...
first - the L293D - i can get it but at $20 *each* that pretty much =
blows my budget for this project of building my very own handy board. =
Any alternatives from farnell (hopefully) so i don't have to pay all =
that postage?
=20
Also i have been unable to find that 32k RAM chip, farnell only stocks =
the 16k and the 64k, not the 32k. Any ideas? Could i use a 64k somehow =
and not use the upper 32k.
=20
The IR demodulator, what is it and what are the alternatives?=20
=20
thanks,
=20
David Perry
