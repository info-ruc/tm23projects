Try this web page:
http://www.mech.utah.edu/~kleang/robotics/info/roboinfo.html . It should
have what you want. I have not tried it myself, but I do have the
reciever/transmitter pair described on the page.

<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>Is it possible to slow
down the speed of the serial interface on the Handyboard? I have just
gotten hold of a couple of RF transmit/receive pairs, but they are only
able to go up to about 1200 baud or so. I don't intend using IC over the
link, just a simple serial program to send/receive small amounts of data.

<fontfamily><param>Arial</param><smaller>Can this be done, and if so, how
would I go about it? My assembly coding is less than fantastic, so if
anyone has any code etc they'd like to share I would not complain :-) If
not, any tips/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
