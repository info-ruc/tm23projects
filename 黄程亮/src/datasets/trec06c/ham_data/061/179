Did your team solder the proper capacitor into the sonar board
in accordance with the instructions on the HB web site? I was
just wondering, because others who forgot the capacitor have
reported similar problems.

Also, you may want to try tweaking the blanking interval from
1000 to 1200 in the sonar_closeup() function in order to get
good readings; my sonar wouldn't reliably read quite as close
as some others, I guess.

It's important to realize that occasionally you're supposed to
get a -1 back from the function; it means that an error
occurred -- typically that no echo was received before the
timer counter maxed out.

Even when I got my Polaroid sonar operating well, I still got
noisy readings. I almost completely eliminated the problem by
writing a new sonar sample function that always takes three
sonar readings, but returns only the median (middle) value. You
need only two or three comparison (if) statements to do this,
so it's pretty fast, and it works extremely well in practice.
There are almost never going to be two noisy readings out of
three. Some others have suggested using the average of three
readings, but I found that not to work very well at all (e.g.,
what's the average of 99, 101, and -1,000?). Best of luck!
