PE Micro has a program that converts binary into S-records.

Or, you may want to look into a program called Sox.  Sox converts just
about any sound format into just about any other.  You could, trivially,
convert a WAV file into a pulse code modulated, 16 or 8 bit stream, if you
didn't want to write support for WAV files.
