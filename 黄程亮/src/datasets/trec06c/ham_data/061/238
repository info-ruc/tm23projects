hi all,
could anyone pls point me to where i can get the assembler instruction set
for the 68HC11 processor.

many thanks
m fazal


I would like to put in my bi-annual plug for the text The 68HC11
Microprocessor by Joseph Greenfield.  This
is a good reference for lots of 68HC11 stuff including timers, interrupts,
etc but it is unreasonably pricey.  If you just want the instruction set,
you can get that from the "pink book" or small reference guide, available
free from Motorola.
