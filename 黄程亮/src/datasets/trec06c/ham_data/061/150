Does anyone know how to reduce the baud rate used by IC?  (I'm running Mac 
version 3.1.)  I'd like to replace the serial cable with an RF link, but 
keep the interactivity of IC.

Incidentally, I've found that the Parallax RF stamps work quite well on my 
Rug Warrior, though in retrospect I might have gone for something less 
expensive.

Thanks!
