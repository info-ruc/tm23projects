The obvious question is how you are measuring your capacitor and resistor
values?. Resistors (presumably metal film), are typically +/-1%, but
capacitors are unlikely to be 'better' than +/-5%, and may be significantly
worse than this (many 'normal' capacitor lines are +/-20%, whiole +/-10% is
typical. So any oscillator based on this type of component, could easily cover
your 'real' frequency. A frequqncy in the order of 43k, from an oscillator
designed to give 38.6k, sounds typical for such a component. This is why
filter designs end up using expensive 1% capacitors. If this is for infra red
comm's, then I wouldn't worry. The '38k' used is very nominal, with the IR
receiver on (say) the Mindstorms typically accepting frequencies from about
26k to over 50k. At the end of the day you are just going to have to change
your resistor, or 'accept' that you now understand teh effect of component
tolerances...

Best Wishes
