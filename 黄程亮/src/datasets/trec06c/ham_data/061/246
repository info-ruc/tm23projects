I guess this is a common problem, which is based on the low power
consumption of the LEGO motors (the speed of the motors DOES change,
but not significantly). There are two ways of solving this problem:

1. Try Julian Skidmores smooth power routines with 100 different
speedvalues at:
  
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/contrib.html
   The motor-control is much better.

2. Visit http://www2.graupner.com/ and ask for Part-No. 2735 -
Micro-Speed 4. This device has the size of a matchbox and enables servo-
   control for a motor. Of course this solution is only possible, if you
have the Expansion-Board installed. The price is about $25.00.

Hope this helps.
