Hi All,

On Saturday, March 25, 2000, 3-5pm, Penn State Abington College, Abington, PA
(Phila., PA USA region) will host a Fire-Fighting Robot Contest based on
the rules of the International Fire-Fighting Robot Contest held annually at
Trinity College.  The goal is for a mobile robot to explore a maze
consisting of 4 rooms, locate a candle, and extinguish the candle in the
minimum time. (We have also made a few minor modifications such as no 
penalty for touching the wall, and a special exhibition for team 
robots.)  Use your Handy Board or LegoMindstorms or...

The Penn State Abington event is open to the public as participants and
spectators, and is free.  There will be prizes (TBD). We try to have
good time and there's always free pizza. It is a great way to prepare for
the Trinity contest in April.  Information about the contest can be found
at  http://www.ecsel.psu.edu/~avanzato/robots/contests/

Thanks

-Bob
