Hello all,

    I expect my handyboard to arrive in the mail within a few days... so I
am playing around with some ideas of what I want to accomplish with it.

my question:

has anybody integrated a radio controlled car remote (wireless) with a
handyboard based robot?  Is there any FAQ's on this subject?  I would really
like to know the basics of such a device and how I can control the outputs,
and /or construct my own.

This all came about after visiting my local Radio shack and seeing the
neutral position 12-way switch..  That just HAS to be cool controlling
something : >



Thanks for the help
