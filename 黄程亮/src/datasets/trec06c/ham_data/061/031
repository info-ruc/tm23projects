My problem is in running downloader. I am supplying power directly to the board
but all that it displays is top row of black boxes which are kind of faded.
Then I run the downloader program and it says it worked but the welcome
message doesn't come up. Instead I get the same row of boxes and the green
light on the board only turns on instead of flashing on and off. I reseted the
board anyway so I can run IC but it doesn't work. I know the cmd line is
correct because I made the board work once but one day it stoped working. Is
there a place I can send the board so it can be fixed or is there a simple
solution to my problem?
