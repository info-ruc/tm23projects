Hi everyone,
Does anyone know exactly how many lines of code can fit on the board before IC
begins to run out of memory??  I can't seem to find an exact figure anywhere.
Our robot must have the ability to detect signals from a sony remote control,
detect IR emissions, shoot IR at a target, utilize 1 sonar, control 1 servo
motor, control 2 DC motors with encoders, room mapping, and also have an AI to
control everything.  Is this too much to try to fit on the board??  Help
please!!!
