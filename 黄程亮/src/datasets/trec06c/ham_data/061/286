I had a close look at that IR receiver and gasp - it looks just the same =
as one i bought from a local store, dick smith electronics. The part =
IS1U60 is listed as U60. It is now discontinued but the replacement, U61 =
is just the same, only buffered. Personally i hate the customer service =
at my local store but the internet service is excellent. Anyway, the URL =
is www.dse.com.au .

Hope this helps someone,

David Perry
