  Oh, I see.  Yes, a command line switch to force the selection of the
primary video and sound card drivers probably isn't a bad thing.  Usually
those displays aren't enumerated unless they are attached to the machine,
I'm betting all games that allow you to choose which display driver you
want to use are going to fail in the same fashion if you choose the last
display driver there.  I might also change TimeDX to pick the first driver
in the list by default as it appears to be safer than the last driver these
days (I don't think it was when I wrote TimeDX).

  For reference if this problem should crop up again run REGEDIT at the
Start / Run prompt, find the key TimeDX (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \
TimeDX) and delete the whole thing if this problem should occur again.  You
will have to re-enter all TimeDX parameters again but it's the failsafe way
to reset TimeDX.  Should you wish to only reset the display driver you
could just delete the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ Software \ TimeDX \ Video_Driver
key instead, TimeDX should just prompt you for a new display driver.
