Ah!  I see the problem.  If you really wanted to do it, I'm sure you
could scan through the Mac software to find where the baud rate was set,
and then change a few bytes.  It might take some time to find it though.
You could also ask Newton Labs for ideas on how to do it.  They might
point you to the right bytes to tweak or if you're real lucky perhaps
send you a new binary with a different baud rate by default.

Agreed on the interactivity.  The biggest strong point for IC.

Good luck,
