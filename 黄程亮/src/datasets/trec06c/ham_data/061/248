Thank you, Russ and Nigel,

boot.exe works fine. 
It can surely load 9pc*.

My goal is to construct 9fs on the PC with K6-2/350.
9pcfs does not recognize dos on FD.

I first tried to adjust my clock and replaced the data:
	{ 5,	8,	23,	"AMD-K6 3D", },	/* guesswork */
	{ 5,	9,	23,	"AMD-K6 3D+", },/* guesswork */
in /sys/src/9/pc/clock.c and /sys/src/fs/pc/8253.c
by
	{ 5,	8,	11,	"AMD-K6 3D", },	/* guesswork */
	{ 5,	9,	11,	"AMD-K6 3D+", },/* guesswork */

It seems that the values work fine for 9pc and 9pcdisk, and
probably for other 9pccpu*.
However the CPU speed value shown by 9fs is unsteady.
It shows: 20MHz or other values.
