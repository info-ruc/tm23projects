Is it possible to slow down the speed of the serial interface on the =
Handyboard? I have just gotten hold of a couple of RF transmit/receive =
pairs, but they are only able to go up to about 1200 baud or so. I don't =
intend using IC over the link, just a simple serial program to =
send/receive small amounts of data.=20

Can this be done, and if so, how would I go about it? My assembly coding =
is less than fantastic, so if anyone has any code etc they'd like to =
share I would not complain :-) If not, any tips/suggestions would be =
greatly appreciated.

many thanks
Adam Oliver
