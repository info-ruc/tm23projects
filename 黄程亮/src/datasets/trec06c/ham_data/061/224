Since the Hitachi web site is useless and i can't find data sheets for =
the 16x2 display, i am looking for alternatives - i'd like to get them =
from BG micro since they have all kinds of goodies like the 68hc11, RAM =
chips and displays. Which of the following is suitable?

bg micro p# LCD1002
Optrex_DMC 20434-20x4 LCD 8bit ASCII input with hd44780 controller by =
hitachi.

bgmicro p#LCD1010
Optrex_DMC 40131 same as above except with backlight and 40x1 display

The others didn't look sutitable (requires inveter, no controller, etc.)

thanks,

David Perry
