		Gravitational Screening by Superconductors


Introduction
=09
	An instinctual reaction by a member of the physics community to the =
above title might be a cringe or perhaps outright laughter (and maybe an =
arbitrary linear combination of the two).  It is accepted that the =
relative effects of gravity are approximately 38 orders of magnitude (or =
so) smaller than electromagnetic affects, yet an experiment performed in =
1992 by  E.E. Poletnokov  indicated anomolous mass loss ( ~ 0.05%) for a =
sample of SiO2 placed above a rotating,  levitating YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-x)  =
(YBCO) superconductor [1].  Poletnokov, a materials science researcher, =
interpreted the results as due to possible gravitational shielding by =
the superconductor and suggested a possible mechanism:  "The gravity =
shielding effect might be the result of a certain state of energy which =
exists inside the crystal structure of the superconductor at low =
temperatures. This unusual state of energy might change the regular =
interaction between electromagnetic, nuclear and gravitational force =
fields inside a superconductor, and is responsible for the observed =
phenomenon."   This statement appears to satisfy the symptom of =
pathological science wherein fantastic theories contrary to experience =
are suggested [2].   However, one can argue that Poletnokov was merely =
giving a qualitative hypothesis, rather than expounding a fantastic =
theory.  The creation was left to Giovanni Modanese [3].  Of course, I =
interpreted the papers with a preconceived bias, based on the =
aforementioned Langmuir paper, and will thus attempt to provide a =
somewhat objective account of the original experiments and follow up =
work (both theoretical and experimental).=20
=20
The 1st Experiment

	The original experiment in 1992 involved placing a 5g sample of SiO2 15 =
mm above a 275 mm diameter YBCO disk 6mm thick which was levitating =
above a solenoid due to the Meisner effect.  The SiO2 was attatched by a =
piece of nonconducting thread to an electro-optical balance with a =
precision of 10^-6 grams.  The authors noted:  "Every precaution was =
taken to prevent the influence of static electricity and air flow on the =
sample or the supporting thread. Also, the electro-optical balance was =
shielded from the possible influence of electromagnetic fields."  =
Earlier in the paper the authors remarked that a thin transparent =
plastic foil was used to prevent the He vapor from affecting the SiO2.  =
Without rotation of the YBCO, a 0.05% mass loss was recorded.  The YBCO =
was then rotatated via magnetic coils over a frequency range 50 to 106 =
Hz.  The authors reported the weight loss fluctuated between  0.049% and =
 0.053%  due to this roatation.

	De Posta and Bull published an alternative interpretation citing =
bouyancy as the mechanism for the quoted weight loss [4].  The =
experiment was repeated in 1997 with null results for the case of non- =
rotation of the YBCO, contradictory to the results quoted above [5].  A =
null result was also recorded by P. Skeggs in 1997 for both rotation and =
non-rotational effects [6]. In 1995 Poletnokov published a second =
experiment which was repeatedly revised over the next two years due to =
peer review demands [7].

The Second Experiment

	The second experiment proceeded as in the first with some exceptions. =
The author notes, "A new experimental technique was employed to modify =
the structure of the ceramic superconductor."  In addition, frequencies =
up to 10^8 Hz were used and magnetic fields up to 2 T.  Poletnokov =
varied the sample (originally SiO2), the sample's mass, and the distance =
from the sample to the YBCO.  The samples were weighed in a closed glass =
tube and the YBCO was placed in a cryostat.  Poletnokov found that mass =
loss (in %) was independent of the sample, the sample's mass, and the =
distance the sample was from the YBCO (up to 3 meters!) .  He also =
recorded a 0.05%  weight loss for the non-rotating case (as in the first =
experiment) and a weight loss of up to 2.1 % for high rotational =
frequencies (~3500 rpm) of the YBCO.

 	The experiment has not been repeated. Poletnokov ascribes the null =
result, reported by Ying's group [4] for the stationary case, to =
dissimilar YBCO's.  Poletnokov writes:  "A NASA group in Huntsville, =
Alabama, is now attempting to replicate our experiment . This is a =
difficult task, especially in view of the sophisticated technology =
involved in the construction of the large ceramic disk and in the =
control of its rotation."  =20

Theoretical Justification

	An explanation of the effect was proposed by Modanese in 1995.  He =
argued that if the effect was real, it was theoretically highly =
improbable from either a classical gravitation (there are no opposite =
gravitational charges) or quantum point of view ( interaction of =
gravitons with atoms is exceeedingly weak).  He therefore proposed a =
quantum gravitational mechanism with an added coupling mechanism =
because, as the author says, "a shielding effect cannot be explained by =
classical General Relativity, nor by the usual perturbation theory of =
quantum gravity coupled to the Cooper pair density."  This ad -hoc =
coupling term produces gravitational instabilities within the YBCO =
resulting in partial shielding.


Discussion

The previous paragraphs contain many of the symptoms of a pathological =
science:  There are claims to great accuracy; the effect is difficult to =
detect if one has not made the "correct" YBCO; the effect is independent =
of distance of the sample from the YBCO ; the causative agent is =
undetectable -- shielding of as yet undetected gavitational radiation; =
and new theoretical mechanisms are required to justify the experiment.  =
There also seems to be little or no chance of any (publishable) repeats =
of the Poletnokov experiment in the near future if research proceeds as =
exemplified by one of the researchers in the field, physicist Ni Ling at =
the University of Alabama in Huntsville (co-author of null experiment).  =
She has, according to Discover Magazine,  "stopped publishing papers and =
no longer speaks of her techniques or experimental results, saying she =
fears any delays will give foreign researchers the lead."  Apparently, =
the possibilities for industrial applications will outweigh the effort =
to verify the (un)reality of the so-called gravitational shielding.  I =
believe the effect is highly improbable due to the lack of =
reproducibility of the experiments and an inability to explain the =
effect by conventional theoretical physics. As of now, the year 2000, =
NASA has been unable to verify the effect.
