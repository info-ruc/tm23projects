Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Eduado de Mello, one of the Principal Commanders of the Union
for the Total Independence of Angola,UNITA.Well needless telling a very
long story here for our story is indeed interwoven with the history of the world and the liberation struggle in the Southern African region of the African continent.

The bubble burst just about a couple of months ago when my supreme 
commander, the late Dr.Jonas Savimbi was killed in an encounter with
the government forces of the MPLA government of my country.The rest is now history but suffice it to say that I am tired of the unfortunate role of waging a war against my fatherland.I have therefore decided to pull out my troupes from the bush even if the other field commanders decide otherwise I am therefore poised to effect a new beginning in my life and I have decided to make South Africa my new home at least for the interim period until I am sufficiently sure that I would be welcome home whole heartedly by the MPLA government in Luanda the capital of Angola.

Needles to say I was the single most important commander who was very
close to the late supreme commander; Dr.Jonas Savimbi.Indeed because I am a brother to one of his wives,he confided in me a great deal.
The result of such trust is my reason for contacting you. I was the
commander whom he sent to deposit the sum of Thirty two million USD
($32million) with a security/finance company in South Africa.This was
immediately after the events of September 11,2001 in the United
States of America.Indeed it had become increasingly difficult to move large volumes of money around the world particularly for a liberation movement like UNITA hence the recourse to keeping the money with the security company in South Africa. 

I have decided to inherit this money which was taken out and
deposited with the said security/finance company as cash in Hundred dollar denominations.The money is kept in my signature and would have been used in the purchase of arms and ammunition for the purposes of 
continuing the civil war in Angola.
The supreme commander is dead and as already stated I have decided to
quit the whole thing and this is without regard to the fact that other
commanders may wish to continue !

I want to cooperate with you in my decision to inherit the $32million.I am still in the bush here but I have been able to establish contact with the company in South Africa to the effect that I would soon come to take possession of the money that I kept with them.
Note also that I deposited the money as a foreign national who is the
head of a Mining company in Angola (Never as a commander of UNITA). 

If you are able to cooperate with me over this am willing to give you
20% of the $32million.Please come back to me through email:
demello@themail.com 
The security/finance company is standing by to receive my
instructions on this and I will link you up with them as soon as you are ready to take possession of the $32million.

Finally you are to note that in you reply, you are to state your
residential or company address and if possible send a copy of your international passport so as to assure me that my money is safe in your hands.

Yours truly,

Eduado de Mello
