I think this is a key point. The much touted features of OpenType
with respect to ligaturing etc. are of great benefit to naive programs
(such as unmentionable stuff from certain well known major companies)
that do not do any careful typography such as kerning and ligatures.

It is of no benefit for TeX and it actually gets in the way. TeX needs to
know the metrics of all glyphs it typesets in advance so it can do its clever
paragraph line layout.  It can't do the best job if afterwards some
glyphs are replaced and the width of typeset material changes.

Regards, Berthold.
