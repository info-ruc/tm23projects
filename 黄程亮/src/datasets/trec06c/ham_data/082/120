Right, but for TeX that makes the problem easier, no?

But not with OpenType fonts :(

TeX/GX had a nice compromise on this front (and though I'm loathe to
give up the flexibility of virtual fonts, it would be nice to just
drag-drop Adobe Garamond Pro and have it ``just work'')

Right, but this then limits one to Windows or Mac OS <9 (I really wish
BSR would Carbonize Textures). It's also kind of disingenuous to bring
them up since neither automagically handles rich fonts like to OpenType AIUI.

Interesting (sure wish I could find a copy of OS/2 for Pens for my
Fujitsu pen slate).

But at:
http://www.micropress-inc.com/texdocs/index.html

there're no details on the nature of your support of OpenType---am I
missing where to look this up?

While I appreciate, and don't mind the commercial implementations
stepping forward, naturally the thrust of my query was toward some sort
of generally available / open implementation (has TUG considered funding
such?). 

::mental note:: order a copy of _TeX: The Program_....
