Next week I am teaching a workshop on research in education.  I am
highlighting several programs including Lesson Study.  Catherine Lewis has
spoken at Chabot Space & Science Center where the workshop will be held, so
some of the teachers are familiar with the work.

I would like to have them observe a class and log in answers to questions.  
1. Is there a specific format for an observation?
2. Does each teacher observe for a different question?
3. What kinds of questions?  Are they specific to the lesson or general such
as Are the students on task?

Thanks in advance.
