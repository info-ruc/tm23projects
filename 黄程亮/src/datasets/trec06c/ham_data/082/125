I guess you didn't read what I wrote. And it has been written many times 
before.
You can probably do a search on this group or comp.text.tex

TeX does all of this sort of thing, and in return, it cannot tolerate this
happening "under the hood". It requires TFM metric files that it can
believe in. TeX cannot work properly when things can change while
it isn't looking.

This means that some of the nfity things about OpenType fonts are
not only not useful for TeX users, but actually get in the way.  Somehow
it doesn't matter too much though since many OpenType fonts are just
wrappers for T1 or TT fonts with none of the hairy stuff added.

Unicode is a separate issue from OpenType.
TeX is inherently limited to 8-bit bytes in a rather serious way.
The exception is Omega --- which you are welcome to try.
(This is not to say that implementations may not internally use
Unicode --- it is just not accessible in the TeX source code).

Regards, Berthold.
