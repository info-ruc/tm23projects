Well, there seem to be enough slots left in reasonable encodings
for deal with quite a range of ligatures beyond fl, fi, ff, ffi, and ffl.
I am not sure what the problem would be with adding ct, st, fj, ll etc.

I am sure you can come up with some special case
(such as Arabic) where you will run out with TeX limitation of 256,
but for "normal" use, like Adobe Garamond, I see no reason.
(Or are you somehow torturing yourself unnecessarily with
Cork encoding?)

Well, OT is not the solution, since you loose TeX's wonderful
capabilities to typeset properly.  If you *really* have more
ligatures than can fit (and they aren't just a designers random
doodling) then you just may have to look at Omega.
