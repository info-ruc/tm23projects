IT IS WITH NATURAL TRUST THAT I WRITE TO SOLICIT YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND ASSISTANCE IN AN URGENT AND MUTUALLY BENEFITING BUSINESS TRANSACTION. 

I GOT YOUR DATA FROM THE NIGERIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND INDUSTRY, AND A CHECK ON YOUR PROFILE HAS CONVINCED ME THAT YOU COULD BE TRUSTED WITH A LARGE SUM OF MONEY THAT WE INTEND TO TRANSFER OVERSEAS, FOR SAFE KEEPING.

THE PAST MILITARY DISPENSATION. 

DURING THE COURSE OF MY COMMITTEES ASSIGNMENT, I DISCOVERED A DELIBERATELY OVER INVOICED AND UNCLAIMED CONTRACT PAYMENT TO THE TUNE OF US$50 MILLION (FIFTY MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY). THIS FUND HAS BEEN FLOATING RELUCTANTLY AND UNIDENTIFIED IN THE VAULT OF 
THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN), READY FOR IMMEDIATE TRANSFER. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SECTARY OF MY COMMITTEE WHO IS ONLY PRIVY TO THIS, WE HAVE MADE ADEQUATE AND FULL PROOF ARRANGEMENT TO TRANSFER THE FUND IN QUESTION INTO A FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT.

MODALITY TO OFFICIALLY FORWARD YOUR DATA AS THE CONTRACTOR AND THE BENEFICIARY OF THE FUND HAS BEEN PERFECTED THROUGH OUR PRIVILEGED POSITION. 

MOREOVER THE ORIGINAL FOREIGN CONTRACTOR OF THE OVER INFLATED GENERAL CONTRACT COVER HAS LONG BEEN PAID AND HAS SINCE LEFT NIGERIA, LEAVING US WITH NO ONE TO CONTEND WITH. 

FOR YOUR MOST VITAL ROLE HERE, WE HAVE AGREED TO OFFER YOU 25% OF THE TOTAL FUND, WITH 5% SET ASIDE FOR TRANSFER LOGISTICS AND EXPENSES, WHILE WE RETAIN THE BALANCE 70% IT IS HOPED THAT YOU WILL WANT TO AVAIL YOUR SELF OF THIS LIFE TIME OPPORTUNITY. IF SO CONVEY YOUR KIND 
ACCEPTANCE IMMEDIATELY. YOU SHOULD ALSO FURNISHME WITH YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER(S) FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. 

I EXPECT TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY, AFTER WHICH YOU WILL BE COMPREHENSIVELY DETAILED ON THIS TRANSACTION.
