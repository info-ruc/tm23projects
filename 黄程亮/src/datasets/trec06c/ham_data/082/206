<DIV>I'm new to Lesson Study.&nbsp; Is there&nbsp;any Lesson Study work focused on&nbsp; teaching English as a Second Language, especially as it relates to the teaching of adults?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Also, is there&nbsp;any work that compares the type and amount of lesson preparation&nbsp;by teachers of English as a Second Language in the United States as compared to "non-native" teachers of English as a Foreign Language in other countries?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Thank you in advance for any information or references.</DIV></DIV>
