Vic,

Please add to your mailing list

Hideko Iwamoto
iwamoto@u.washington.edu

Ryuta Hazama
hazama@marie.npl.washington.edu, hazama@km.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp

also note, it's "carbonyl" not "carboneal".

Thanks,

Hamish


>1.  Chemistry (Doug and Vic)
>	There was a brief initial discussion about whether the quenching
>in some of these Molybdenum solutions was collisional or du to optical
>absorption.  Hamish then asked about whether some of the molybdenum
>nitrates or acetyle acetonates were viable alternatives to molybdenum
>carboneal.
>	Doug informed us that the MIBK was finally here, and then
>presented an outline of the schedule of chemical testing over the next few
>weeks:
>	-Tuesday (07/09/2002): spend the day getting used to the
>	instrument over in the EH department, and run the standard
>	solutions of Mo-carboneal in PC.  Hamish mentioned that the Mo
>	carboneal we have was a special highly distilled sample we had to
>	order from Russia with quite a bit of lead time, so we need to be
>	mindful of how much we will need so that we can order more if
>	necessary.
>	-Wednesday and Friday (07/10/2002 and 07/12/2002): go back to test
>	for degradation of the standard solutions.
>	-Thursday (07/11/2002): prepare standard solutions with the other
>	solvents to be tasted on Friday, as well.
>
>Action Items:
>	1. Peter needs to compile the results of the quench tests for
>	   Doug.
>	2. Doug will distribute the testing schedule and investigate the
>	   alternative Mo compounds Hamish suggested.
>	3. Hamish will lookup the Alfa Aesar catalogue number for the
>	   compounds he suggested for Doug.

>2.	APDs (Hamish, George and Hideko):
>	George has been compiling information on APDs, and has found five
>good places to buy them: Advanced Photonics, Ortec, RMD, GPD, and
>Hamamatsu.  The Ortec APDs have some of the best specs, but are VERY small
>(<0.5 mm), which makes them ill suited for our experiment.  AP has the
>biggest selection of sizes (3mm, 5mm, 10mm, 16mm).  We then talked about
>how we can make sure that we are getting single photon counting (i.e. what
>kid of sources to use, geometry of our setup, etc.), and how much dark
>current our experiment can handle.
>
>Action Items:
>	1. George will check the availability of APDs from AP.
>	2. George will also start working on calculating the charge per
>	   pulse, dark current, pulse rate, cutoff voltage, and required
>	   resistance for each of the APDs in which we are interested.
>	3. Hideko and Hamish will continue to work on the spatial
>	   resolution calculations.
>	4. Hamish George and Hideko will meet Wednesday in Hamish's office
>	   to discuss APD issues.
>
>3.	Energy Resolution (Vic):
>	Vic made some progress last week on getting the ideal form of the
>0nu + 2nu double beta spectra.  He had been using a simple shifted
>Gaussian for the 2nu spectrum, which Hamish informed his was probably not
>a good choice because the "wings" of the distribution were too big.  There
>was also some question as to the relative normalization of the two
>spectra.  From the discussion in Bohem and Vogel, Vic concluded that the
>ratio of the areas under the 0nu and 2nu spectra should be approximately
>10^-8.  This is MUCH lower than the numbers being presently quoted.  This
>could be because Bohem and Vogel is a ten year old book, or because Vic
>didn't fully understand their treatment of the subject.  Vic also
>finished writing the computer program that uses a Monte Carlo to jumble
>the "idealized" data.
>
>Action Items:
>	1. Vic will replace the shifted Gaussian in the 2nu spectrum with
>	   a more physical functional form.
>	2. Vic will continue to work on this problem.
>
>4.	Discussion of Reading Material (all)
>	It was almost 5:30 by the time we got to this item, so we ended
>the meeting.
