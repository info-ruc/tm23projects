Farther and Faster out of this World: Glenn Demonstrates High-Power Electric
Propulsion

A giant leap toward enabling high power electric propulsion was recently
demonstrated. With power levels up to 72 kW and nearly 3 Newtons of thrust,
NASA's Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, has designed, built and
successfully tested a 50 kW-class Hall thruster.

Designated the NASA-457M, this new Hall thruster has shown more than a
factor of ten increase in the power and thrust levels over state-of-the-art
Hall systems. "This accomplishment strengthens Glenn's world class
leadership in Hall thruster research and development," asserts Robert
Jankovsky, Hall thruster team lead.

Such a high power propulsion device will revolutionize the next generation
of spacecraft; halving launch costs for ambitious NASA missions, enabling
future NASA missions to other planets, and more than doubling commercial
payload masses to geostationary orbit. Applications for the Hall thruster
include moving heavy payloads and more rapid travel into outer space. When
compared to ion thrusters, Hall thrusters are of greater benefit to
near-Earth orbit missions, because they have greater levels of thrust to
counter the forces of gravity of celestial bodies, like the Earth.

The NASA-457M is the largest Hall thruster ever built and tested. This
effort has significantly enhanced understanding of Hall thruster scaling and
will lead to the use of high power Hall thruster propulsion in future space
missions.

Results and findings of the Hall thruster's recent tests were discussed
yesterday at the 38th American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
Joint Propulsion Conference in Indianapolis.

A photograph of the NASA-457M Hall thruster is available online:

Someone on the Starship Design list has Klez. I just received an email
purporting to be from Ben Franchuk, which only means that whomever is
infected has Ben in their email addresses file, and of course, myself also.
Kind of limits it to Starship Design.

The Spacefaring Web: 2.11
Writing in the Infrared

by John Carter McKnight
Scottsdale - Jul 04, 2002

Ideas and technologies that were recently only the wildest speculation now
are hotly, even violently, debated worldwide. But not the prospect of a
spacefaring future. While many address opportunities in space, their work
seems to fall into a cultural blind spot, present but unseen. It's as if
they were writing in the infrared: something is there, discernable by anyone
sufficiently attuned. The world at large, though, literally cannot see the
writing on the wall.

There is a chasm between innovation and adoption. On the one side there may
be a good idea whose time hasn't come (or a harebrained notion that'll never
amount to anything - they look the same from a distance). On the other side
lies ubiquitous application of the brilliant-but-seemingly-inevitable fruits
of the inventor's genius. How does an idea go from invisible to inevitable?

Some say that the innovation has to be honed to elegance before adoption.
While the fallacy here should be obvious to anyone who has ever used a
personal computer or a VCR, this argument has persisted. We haven't gone to
Mars, the argument goes, because rockets are kludgy; the day we have
nuclear-thermal propulsion the colony ships will leave.

At one of the early Case For Mars conferences, there was a marvelously
thought-provoking presentation entitled "Romans To Mars." The author
demonstrated that it would have been marginally possible for the Romans to
have discovered and settled the New World with staggered convoys of galleys,
but at immense cost. The argument was that, since using an adequate but
suboptimal technology was prohibitively expensive, rationally, the
settlement of the New World would have to wait upon the advent of the
deep-draught sailing ship. By analogy, Mars must await advanced propulsion.

That argument fails on several grounds. First, optimal sailing technology
was not necessary. A rational cost-benefit analysis might have sent Roman
galleys to Mexico. Romans had been great commercial explorers as late as
Caligula's time; a later emperor might rationally have chosen to revive the
enterprise in hopes of bringing new wealth into an over-extended,
cash-strapped empire. Likewise, the Elizabethan decision to explore and
settle North America was less technologically favorable and a greater
gamble. Rome had the resources and discipline to send a fleet into the
unknown; Elizabeth's backing of exploration by her quasi-pirates was a
high-stakes gamble by a third-rate power with, even by the standards of the
time, second-rate naval technology. A crewman on one of Henry Hudson's or
Martin Frobisher's ships likely would have traded a limb for a berth on a
Nova Roman galley, let alone a bare-bones Mars Direct hab.

Elegance is not likely to develop before an innovation suddenly appears
blindingly obvious. In the technological realm, an invention typically goes
from kludge to cool later in its lifetime, only after becoming widespread.
The early market entrants make a killing selling the Mark One; the laggards
can only turn a profit by cutting production costs, streamlining design,
offering advanced features to a market accustomed to the basic model and
ready for more. I won't shell out $200,000 for a Lamborghini if I still like
my horse and buggy just fine. A couple hundred for a Model T, maybe. Once
I'm sold on driving, then I'm ready for something sleeker, faster, redder,
and with cupholders. Sellers of computer networks may recall this mindset
among corporate customers in the 1980s.

With ideas, elegance won't get you across the chasm either. Copernicus
didn't enter the history books because he was the first person to look at
the tangled mess of Ptolemaic cosmology and see the beautiful simplicity of
a heliocentric alternative. Darwin was not the first to look at the breadth
of physical traits and conceive an active mechanism for their evolution:
we'd been selectively breeding plants and animals for millennia. Da Vinci's
notebooks epitomize writing in the infrared: if elegance were sufficient,
the Borgia Popes would have flown to church in helicopters.

No, "invention is the easy bit," as the Economist Technology Quarterly (June
23, 2001, p.3) observed. "It matters little whether some exciting new
technology has suddenly become available. If the market timing is wrong, the
innovation will most assuredly flounder." The Economist's editor draws a
distinction between need - would it be useful? and demand - will anybody pay
for it? Only demand gets you across the chasm. This explains the VCR: the
demand for home movies and timeshifted TV programs was so great that the
kludgy VCR sold like hotcakes. Twenty-five years later TiVO and the DVD
player finally provide an elegant means of filling that demand. Ptolemy's
teachings were tied to the authority of the medieval Church: when that
authority was unquestionable, there was no prospect of a heretical
heliocentrism catching on. Come the Renaissance, when "market conditions"
were ripe for free-thinking, an elegant idea could gobble market- (or mind-)
share.

Why isn't asteroid mining on the agenda at the World Economic Forum? Why
aren't protesters in the street denouncing Martian terraforming plans? Only
with demand does opposition come forth. Nobody fights either the impossible
or the inevitable, only the likely. Borderless commerce and genetic
engineering have vigorous champions and enemies: we see those innovations as
likely. A spacefaring civilization is needed but not demanded. It is not
seen as likely; it is not seen at all.

But what creates demand? One theory, historical determinism, seems more
descriptive than analytical. Science fiction writers have long spoken of
"railroading time" - when cultural forces align for railroads to be
ubiquitous, there will be railroads. When it's time for evolution, Darwin
and Wallace will submit simultaneous papers. Determinism is a nice
refutation of the "elegant technology" argument: if there's a
readily-perceived demand, any number of people will cobble together
something to fill it, as witnessed by the variety of early bicycle and
airplane designs, before those technologies matured to elegance. Yet
determinism can only explain after the fact: it doesn't account for why
railroads took off when they did, rather than a decade earlier or later. Nor
is it a guide to whether the next decade will be "human genetic engineering
time" or "nanotech time" - or, at last, spacefaring time.

The other approach to causation is the "great man" theory. Beloved of space
advocates who point to Henry the Navigator and John F. Kennedy, this claims
that an idea crosses the chasm into ubiquity when somebody big enough grabs
it and hurls it. It's true that new industries arise when one or a few
people see a newly-arisen demand and strike first to fill it. Marconi with
radio, Rockefeller with petroleum products, Gates with operating systems -
the early bird does get the worm. With ideas, a bold promoter matters:
Huxley did as much for evolution as Darwin; planetary astronomy was advanced
more by Percival Lowell's popularizing as by his critics' meticulous
accuracy. The key phrase above, though, was "see a newly arisen demand." The
"great man" only rises to dominate an existing, visible market. A
revolutionary leader can only come to power when there's a market for
revolution - otherwise, his head ends up on a pike outside the palace.
Likewise, Kennedy didn't create an American demand for a space-race
spectacular - that's the logic error committed by the "next Apollo"
advocates who invoke his name.

As Kim Stanley Robinson has observed ("A Sensitive Dependence," in Remaking
History and Other Stories, p.446), "the great man theory considers
particles; historical materialism considers waves. The wave/particle
duality, confirmed many times by experiment, assures us that neither can be
the complete truth. Neither theory will serve as the covering law." People
do shape events, individually as well as in the aggregate, creating those
"tipping points" that move innovation into exploitation.

Innovation, promotion and demand are intertwined, feeding back upon each
other in complex ways. No one alone is sufficient, nor can any one be
slighted. Von Braun went from dreaming to advocacy to building moon rockets.
Born promoters have found inspiration in the innovations of others and
spread the word: Saul of Tarsus got Christianity across the chasm, as Lenin
did Marxism and Zubrin in-situ resource utilization.

Had Tsiolkovskii and Goddard not pressed on despite being ignored, Korolev
and von Braun could never have gotten us into space. Ray Bradbury considers
a lifetime of space advocacy unwasted (Mars and the Mind of Man, p.133): "If
I seem to be beating a dead horse again and again, I must protest: No! I am
beating, again and again, living man to keep him awake and move his limbs
and jump his mind." Fanciful scheming, crackpot theorizing and howling in
the wilderness may not alone change today's reality. Today, it's not
spacefaring time. But tomorrow it might be. When that tomorrow comes, it
will be because, thanks to the subtle actions of innovators and advocates,
we awaken and open our eyes to discover that we can see, there on the wall,
The Case for Mars, The High Frontier and so many other works once written in
the infrared.

The time will come when people believe that they can get to space.
Projects like "The X prize" mean well but give rewards to the 'first'
but not people working together. Getting to space can't be a race,
but rather cooperation of skills and brains and $$$.

A interesting, if wandering, essay.

In general I think the bottom line is things (tech, gadgets, colonization) 
are adopted when they offer something people want, more then what we'ld have 
to give up to get them.  Esentially a economic / marketing view.  We don't 
want to pay for "plant the flag" specticals like Apollo, and can't find any 
way to practicalyu use space.  I.E. theirs no mineral out there worth the 
cost to return, no place with realestate interesting or profitable enough to 
intrest us in colonizing it.   If their were cost competative resources, or 
if Mars looked like Barsom or a Trek world, we'ld be out in force.

So we need to eaither lower the cost a lot, or find something more valuble.  
Look at how fast the Comsat market exploded. Or even how seriously O'Nielian 
plans for Space colonies and power sats were looked into back in the energy 
crisis era.  They looked to fill a needed void, so we were quick to jump on 
them.  just as other bissar things like deep ocean / arctic oil rigs.  Or 
contnent wraping internat infastructures.

Whats space really able to offer us now?  

What would it take to make what it can do, worth the cost to us?

Last couple of weeks, I've been talking to a few friends.  This has resulted
in much design work on my intergrated ship network (the Kitten Modules), and
the associated peripherals.
I also got a name dropped on me, and was wondering if it was familier to
anyone on this list?
The Association Of Autonomous Astronauts, or the AAA.  Anyone?

Checking in,

Sci


PS: Anyone know what sort of componant density is needed on an IC to prevent
radiation-damage? (how do you rad-harden a chip?)
