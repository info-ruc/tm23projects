And some commercial systems do support OpenType (although not
always in the same complete way as Type 1) -- *but* within the limitations
of what TeX can do. That is, you can use any system-installed font
(including Type 1, TrueType and OpenType) for screen display and printing,
and you can write TFMs for these fonts for use by  TeX.  But as discussed, 
TeX is in charge of typesetting, and what clever things it can do it will do, 
and other things it will not, quite independent of what the font format is.

So I think the question should not be "when will TeX support OT?"
(which some implementation already do), but rather "how can we
design a successor to TeX that includes support for the features
of OpenType that TeX currently does not provide?"  And in that case
you may be better off looking at Omega rather than starting from scratch,
or maybe Adobe OnDesign.

As indicated above, AFMs and TFMs for OT fonts can be written by
some commercial TeX systems.  But not the hairy stuff you are looking for,
since TeX does not provide support for them in metric files.

>Yes. I also find it very useful to have the language feature tag ('language system tag'). Then you can have correct 'ch', 'ck', etc. ligatures when german is the current language but not in english where it's useless (and like the 'fi' in turkish, etc.pp.). Not to mention the 'hlig' feature tag.

One rather painless way to do this presently is to have different file directories of TFM files
for different purposes. To switch "system language" you switch a single variable
that tells TeX where the tree of directories is.  Some systems already do this for
convenient and easy switching between font encodings (which require different TFMs).

Regards, Berthold.

Of course you are unlikely to see much development of any of these hairy features
unless the demand for such features picks up.
