Petroleum (Special) Trust Fund 
Contract Award Committee
National Secretariat 
Victoria-Island 
Lagos-Nigeria.


ATTENTION:  MANAGING DIRECTOR

The Petroleum Special Trust Fund was set up by the late Head of State General Sani Abacha who died on 8th June 1998, to manage the excess revenue accruing from the sale of petroleum and its allied products as a result of domestic increase in the prices of petroleum products.

The estimated annual revenue for 1999 was 45 billion US Dollars Ref. FMF A26 Unit 3B paragraph "D" of the Auditor General of the Federal Republic of Nigeria Report of NOV. 1999 on estimated revenue. 

I am the Chairman of the Contract Award committee  and my committee is solely responsible for awarding and payment of contracts on behalf of the Federal Government of Nigeria . 

My Committee awarded contracts to foreign contractors for the supply of Agricultural Machines and spare parts to the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources. We overshot the contract sum by USD18 Million. We have paid the contractors and withholding the balance of 18 Million United States Dollars. 

Beceause of existing domestic laws forbidding civil servants from opening, operating and maintaining foreign accounts, we do not have the expertise to transfer this balance of funds to a foreign account.

However, this balance of 18 Million United States Dollars has been secured in form of credit/payment to a foreign contractor.Hence, we wish to transfer into your bank account as the beneficiary of the funds. 

We have also arrived at a conclusion that you will be compensated to the tune of 25% of the total sum transfered while 5% will be reserved for incidental expenses that both parties will incur in the course of actualizing this transaction and  the balance of 70% will be kept for the Committee members.

 If you know you are capable of helping us actualize our life's dream,You should send to me immediately the details of your bank particulars or open a new account where we can transfer the money(US$18M)which you will hold in trust for us until we come over there for our own share.

 As soon as you open the account, send by e-mail to me or through my partner  ABBAS BABA (bassb1@eudoramail.com ) immediately  with the details of the account viz: Name of bank, address, routing number, telex number, Account number, Tel and Fax number.You should also include the name of your company, your personal address, Tel and Fax numbers for further communication.

 Note that this transaction will be concluded within 10 working days from the day you give your consent.

Sincerely yours,

Dr.Samson Osage
