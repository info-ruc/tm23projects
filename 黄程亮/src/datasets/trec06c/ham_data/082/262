Attn:    CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Sir,
URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION

I got your contact from the Library of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), and somehow  I
feel that we can both handle this transaction in good
fate to our overwhelming benefit.  May I start by
introducing myself, I am ENGR.  GEORGE ORUMA   IGE, 
the son of CHIEF BOLA  IGE the former Minister for
Mines and Power and presently the Minister for Justice
and later shot dead on 23rd December, 2001.  I work
with National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) of
Nigeria, I am presently the General Technical Manager
and also Chairman of the Contract Award Committee of my
parastatal.

When my father was the Minister for Mines and Power he
received a staggering amount of One Hundred twenty
million United States Dollars only (US$120,000,000.00)
from the Presidency for the turn-around maintenance of
all Hydro Energy Station and a few Sub-station in the
country.  He tactically hid away the sum of Thirty-five
million United States Dollars (US$35,000,000.00) in a
suspense account with the Central Bank of Nigeria
(CBN), this fund was clearly labelled “A Contractor’s
Payment”.  This he did before he moved to Ministry of
Justice and later  assacinated him.

Now that my father safely in his new  Ministry, he has
given me a go ahead to get a reliable and reputable
foreigner that will assist me in receiving the fund in
his account as the original contractor that has to be
paid.  He said this is my inheritance from him and that
he will have nothing to do with  it, more so, now that
we have a young democracy all eyes are on the office
holders.

One begins to wonder why I can not go aboard, open an
account and have the money transferred there all by
myself as this of course could have assured utmost
confidentiality of the transaction.  I can not, because
I am Civil Servant and the laws of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria forbids any serving Civil Servant
maintaining foreign account(s).  Secondly, I can not
resign my appointment in order to handle this
transaction as an independent businessman, because I
can not monitor this transfer effectively from outside
my office.  Thirdly, the fund in question has been
embarked “A Contractor’s Payment”, therefore, the
supposed foreign contractor must be presented before
the fund can be legally paid.  Fourthly, my contacting
you is born out of the fact that I need a foreign
company/person with a strong capital base to hold this
huge amount (US$35,000,000.00) in trust, otherwise eye
brows could be raised if it is paid into a lesser
account.

In transferring this money into your account, it is my
considered opinion that you get 30% of the total sum,
10% shall be set aside to take care of all expenses,
and 60% shall be kept in your account till I come over
to your country to invest it with your guidance.

For a smooth sail of this transaction, a masterpiece
plan has been put in place to the effect that the whole
operation will take twenty-one working days to drive it
to a successful or logical conclusion.  (I mean to
remit the fund into your nominated account ).  A
contract number from a contract that has been concluded
and the contractor paid in full has been reasign to
this fund, which means that we now have an authentic
contract number to work with.  Every paper/file in
connection with this transaction shall be carefully
withdrawn from all offices concerned, after the money
must have been safely remitted into your account, thus
leaving no trace of the fund.

However, you should treat this business with utmost
confidentiality, as I and my father do not want
anything to jeopardise our position in the office.   If
you are interested in this transaction, I expect you to
contact  me through my E-mail address:            to
enable me instruct you on what to do as well as furnish
you  with further details.   All I needed from you are
the following:-

YOUR BANK PARTICULARS
THE NAME OF THE BANK AND ADDRESS
THE ROUTING NUMBER AND SORT CODE 
THE TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS OF THE BANK
THE ACCOUNT NUMBER
YOUR COMPANY PHONE AND FAX AND YOUR PERSONAL PHONE AND
FAX FOR EASY COMMUNICATION ALSO YOUR FULL ADDRESS TO
REACH YOU.

Awaiting to hear from you as soon as you finish reading
the message.

Yours faithfully,

ENGR.  GEORGE  ORUMA  IGE
