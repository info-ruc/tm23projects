By ``width'' I meant over-all width of the line.

Changes most certainly _should_ happen _according to the rules in the
fonts_, so if there's e.g., a ct ligature in the OpenType font (but of
which TeX is unaware 'cause the encoding slot it would've used was too
precious and needed something else) that would get subbed in for a ct
pair---naturally this scheme is helped by the ligature and its matching
character pair having the same width, but the GX Line Layout Manager
should be able, at need to shift words as needed (and keep even wordspacing).

>I doubt it actually works as described.  

My experimentation leads me to believe it does work as
described---TeX/GX is linked to from www.tug.org, so if you can scare up
a Mac which'll run System 7.5.1--7.6.1 you can play with it yourself.

Imagine instead a successor to dvips which takes a dvi file and the
attendant virtual fonts and some hypothetical other mapping file and
re-works the dvi file to conform to the applied OpenType fonts' norms of layout.

Should pdfTeX not be called TeX because Hanh added margin kerning and
character expansion as an option?

project and)

I mean User Interface like Illustrator's over-wrought tool palette with
not one, not two, not three, but _nine_ different tool icons for
selecting objects and working with points. By way of contrast, FH8 has
_two_ (and I've complained bitterly to Macromedia of their adding a
third a la Illustrator)

That's why I'm looking at TeX and its derivatives. It runs quite nicely
on my Fujitsu pen slate.

I'm not inclined to displace my NeXT Cube from my desk with a Windows
desktop high-end or no, and this is a personal project, so my employer
wouldn't be funding it. I have two Windows laptops (a ThinkPad, and the
afore-mentioned pen slate), so getting another portable wouldn't get
approval from my significant other---I'm also not wild about ID's
hardware requirements.
