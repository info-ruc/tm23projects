Subject: OpenType in Bakoma



Since version 4.1 of Jan 2002 (or earlier) *Bakoma TeX* (Wintel
shareware on CTAN) boasts the following:


 *************************************************
BaKoMa TeX supports the following font formats:
 * PostScript Type 1 (including Multiple Masters), 
 * PostScript Type 3,
 * TrueType,
 * OpenType,
 * TeX PK/VF.

The system includes about *1500* typefaces in PostScript Type 1
and Type 3 font format including the following fonts:
 * CM (including LaTeX and Logo fonts + vf for T1 with CX
 * AMS Fonts (Euler, Math Symbols),
 * EC/TC,
 * LH (T2A),
 * Concrete (Math, ECC),
 * Malvern,
 * CMCyr + vf for T2A/LCY
 * Scripting fonts, CMPica, Punk.
 Math Fonts: 
 * Stmaryrd, Wasy, Rsfs, YHMath, BlackBoard (bbm, doublestroke).
 Diagram drawing fonts:
 * Lams, Astro Symbols (cmastro, astrosym, moonphase), 
 * Barcodes (barcodes, wlean, wlc*), Logical (loggates, milstd), 
 * timing, MusiXTeX, Chess/CChess, Go, Backgammon, Dingbats/NiceFrame. etc.

Any font type can be used for any output device/format.
This feature is supported by automatic font conversion
between font formats when needed.
This feature enables the rendering of Type 1 fonts *without ATM*.
On the other hand, it enables the use of TrueType/OpenType fonts
for generating PostScript printed even on PostScript Level 1 printers.

PS to William:  I too use Macintosh a good deal.  Could you give a 
thumbnail sketch of the Macintosh application TeX/GX (unique features 
URL etc.) ?
