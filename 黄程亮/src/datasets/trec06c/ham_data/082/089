Attn: Sir. 
Dear Sir, 
We are members of a special committee for budget and planning of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). This committee is principally concerned with contract awards and approval. With Our positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves the sum of Twenty One Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$21.5M). This amount was carefully manipulated by over-invoicing of an old contract. 

Based on information gathered about you, we believe you would be in position to help us in transferring this fund (US$21.5M) into a safe account. It has been agreed that the owner of the account will be compensated with 20% of the remitted funds, while we keep 75%, and 5% will be set aside to offset expenses and pay the necessary taxes. 

All modalities of this transaction have been worked out and once started will not take more than 10 working days, with your full support. This transaction is 100% risk free. 

If this proposal satisfies you, please reach us ONLY by fax or phone, for more information. It might be difficult to get through to me because of poor telecommunication system here. Please keep trying you will definitely get through. Alternatively, email me on the above email address. Please treat as urgent and very confidential. 

Yours faithfully, 
Engr. Robert Obi.

NB: For confidential reasons and due to the poor communication system in my country, most often foreign calls could be diverted to the wrong person. So for you to be very sure you are rightly speaking with me, it is very important that when you call and ask for me, the moment I pick up the phone, you should ask me for the "CODEWORD" and my answer would be "VICTORY before we proceed discussions, but if I do not say "VICTORY", that means you are speaking with me just DISCONNECT the line and call me back till I give you the code word.
