FALOMO OFFICE COMPLEX, IKOYI LAGOS. 



A REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE/COOPERATION. 

IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE IN WRITING YOU THIS LETTER ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AND ME. 

YOUR PARTICULARS WERE GIVEN TO ME BY A MEMBER OF THE NIGERIAN EXPORT PROMOTION COUNCIL (NNPC) WHO WAS AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DELEGATION TO YOUR COUNTRY DURING A TRADE EXHIBITION. I HAVE DEICED TO SEEK CONFIDENTIAL COOPERATION WITH YOU IN THE EXECUTION OF THE DEAL DESCRIBED HERE FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES INVOLVED AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL KEEP IT AS TOP SECRET BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THE BUSINESS AND THE PERSONALITIES INVOLVED. 

WITHIN THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES WHERE I WORK, AS DIRECTOR,PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND WITH THE COOPERATION OF FOUR OTHER TOP OFFICIALS. WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION AS OVER-DUE PAYMENT BILLS TOTALING US$30.5M(THIRTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) WHICH WE WANT TO TRANSFER ABROAD WITH THE ASSISTANCE AND COOPERATION OF TRUSTED FOREIGN FIRM OR INDIVIDUAL THAT WILL RECEIVE THE SAID FUND ON OUR BEHALF INTO ANY ACCOUNT PROVIDED TO RECEIVE SUCH FUND. WE, PUBLIC SERVANTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO OPERATE OFFSHORE ACCOUNT, HENCE YOUR IMPORTANCE IN THE WHOLE TRANSACTION. 

THE AMOUNT US $18.5M REPRESENTED SOME PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL CONTRACT VALUE EXECUTED ON BEHALF OF MY MINISTRY BY A FOREIGN CONTRACTING FIRM, WHICH WE THE OFFICIALS OVER-INVOICED DELIBERATELY. THOUGH THE ACTUAL CONTRACT COST HAVE BEEN PAID TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR, LEAVING THE BALANCE IN THE TUNE OF THE SAID AMOUNT WHICH WE HAVE GOTTEN APPROVAL TO REMIT BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER (TT) TO FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT. YOU WILL PROVIDE BY FILING IN AN APPLICATION THROUGH MY MINISTRY FOR THE TRANSFER OF RIGHT AND PRIVILEGES OF THE FORMER CONTRACTOR TO YOU SINCE THE PRESENT NEW CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT OF MY COUNTRY IS DETERMINED TO PAY EVERY FOREIGN CONTRACTOR ALL DEBIT OWED, SO AS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH FOREIGN GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT FINANCIAL AGENCIES. WE HAVE DECIDED TO INCLUDE OUR BILL FOR APPROVALS WITH THE COOPERATION OF SOME OFFICIALS FROM THE GOVERNMENT MINISTRY, WHICH WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE PAYMENT PROCESS. 

WE ARE SEEKING YOUR ASSISTANCE IN PROVIDING A VITAL ACCOUNT INTO WHICH WE CAN REMIT THIS MONEY BY ACTING AS OUR MAIN PARTNER AND TRUSTEE OR ACTING AS THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR. THIS, WE CAN DO BY SWAPPING OF ACCOUNT AND CHANGING OF BENEFICIARY AND OTHER FORM OF DOCUMENTATION UPON APPLICATION FOR CLAIM TO REFLECT THE PAYMENT AND APPROVALS TO BE SECURED ON BEHALF OF YOU. 

THIS TRANSACTION IS BEING AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE PRINCIPAL TRUSTEE OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR AND WITH THE CONSENT OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR. I HAVE THE AUTHORITY OF MY PARTNERS INVOLVED TO PROPOSE THAT, SHOULD YOU BE WILLING TO ASSIST US IN THE TRANSACTION. YOUR SHARE OF THE FUND WILL BE 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM, 60% FOR US AND 10% FOR TAXATION AND MISCELLANEOUS EXPENSES. THIS BUSINESS IS 100% SAFE ON YOUR PART, BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL. YOUR AREA OF SPECIALIZATION IS NOT A HINDRANCE TO THE SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION OF THIS TRANSACTION. I HAVE REPOSED MY CONFIDENCE IN YOU AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL NOT ISAPPOINT ME. PLEASE FOR EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION, CONTACT ME ON MY EMAIL ADDRESS, AS YOU INDICATE YOUR WILLINGNESS IN ASSISTING US SO THAT I WILL DIRECT YOU WHAT NEXT TO DO. 

PLEASE INCLUDE YOUR DIRECT TEL/FAX NUMBER FOR SECURITY REASONS AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. 

THANKS FOR YOUR ANTICIPATED ASSISTANCE. 

YOURS SINCERELY, 

DR. USMAN BELLO. PH.D., FCA
