Anyone know of any work on this? (beyond of course the rudimentary
support pdfTeX already provides for .otfs w/ TrueType outlines)

I'd really love to find a system like to that of TeX/GX for Macintosh
QuickDraw/GX where system-installed fonts are automagically used and
there's a method for querying the installed font(s) to get their feature-set.
