It depends on which program you trust to do layout.  If you are using
TeX, it's probably because you believe it does a good job of layout.

If things change after it's done looking at things, you are depending
on the font/Quickdraw/whatever to do a better job of layout than TeX
did.  You are also hoping that it doesn't make things _worse_ because
the fonts are designed to improve naive output and the layout TeX did
confuses the font's algorithm.
