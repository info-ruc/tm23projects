Then you might want to try the T1R encoding;
see CTAN:macros/latex/contrib/supported/relenc. It lets you use up to 69
slots for ligatures, whereas all slots in a font that you don't need for a
ligature can contain the same character as in T1.

OTOH I must remark that I'm not as happy with the package now as I was when
I wrote it---there is a dependency between the t1renc.def file and the
relenc package which is definitely not kosher---but on the other hand you
seem prepared to use many other things which aren't standard either.
