Some features of OpenType are nevertheless useful even for TeX,
e.g. vertical representation forms for CJK glyphs or small caps
substitutions.  It is a fact of life that most fonts will come in the
OpenType format today.  Adobe no longer produces Type1 fonts, only
OTFs; so TeX and Omega *must* support this format in the near future.

For many languages the 256 character limit is bad, so I won't discuss
this since Omega can do that better even if you don't use any other
feature of Omega.  What we need is a tool (or a suite of tools) which
prepares OTF fonts for TeX, this is, extracting the various OpenType
tables and converting them to something TeX can understand:

  . Glyph substitution data (in the GSUB table) should be represented
    as different fonts.

  . Kerning data realized as GPOS table should be converted to
    ordinary kerning.

Some data is too sophisticated for TeX (which is a deficiency of TeX,
not of OpenType) -- this should be converted into a set of Omega OTPs:

  . Contextual glyph substition and positioning.

  . Cursive connection data for languages like Urdu.

  . Horizontal and vertical kerning at the same time.
