Dear All,

In the Bellevue School District (10 minutes east of Seattle) we have
been promoting lesson study for two years throughout the district.  Each
secondary school has up to 5 Lesson Study Leaders and every elementary
up to 2 Lessons Study Leaders whose primary role is to support lesson
study in their schools. Lessons Study Leaders receive a leadership
stipend from the district for their work. The lesson study leaders
(K-12) meet monthly for four hours on a topic selected to assist them in
supporting lesson study. 

We spend one of the four hours focused on technology.  They are provided
a menu of activities to choose from but the purpose of all the
activities is their support to lesson study -- e.g. use of the Internet
for both teacher and student research, use of video equipment for
capturing teachers' work.  All our schools received digital video
cameras last spring, so we spent two sessions acquainting them with the
machine and iMovie, and allowed them time to write a script for the
purpose of introducing lesson study to teachers new to the district and
to begin shooting their films.  None of the finished products will make
it to the Oscars, but the LSLs began to appreciate the power of video as
another resource and component of lesson study.

The remaining time has focused on topics such as writing narrative
objectives, assessment, and communication skills.  Several times we have
simply provided them time to work on their lesson studies.

Many of our LSLs will be returning for their third year this fall.  I
plan to meet with a group of them to solicit their suggestions for the
best use of our monthly meetings.  However, I'd be interested in
learning if any of you have used a similar format and what topics you
have included on your agenda.

Thank you!

Teachers can "pay themselves" for as many as 56 hours per diem for
lesson study involvement at the high school level and up to 44 hours at
the elementary level (part of their contractual supplementary pay).
