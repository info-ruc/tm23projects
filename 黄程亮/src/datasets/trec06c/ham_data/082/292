FROM JULIET KAMARA

Dearest one,

Please pray before reading my mail for the result of undersatnding and truth of my proposal.I am Juliet Kamara, the only dauther of late Chief Vincent Kamara, from Sierra Leone. My sources of your contact gave me the courage and confidence to rely on you.

I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek your assistance to transfer our money of Nine million five hundred thousand dollars ($9,500,000) deposited in the custody of a bank here in Abidjan to your private account
pending our rival to your country.

Source of the money. My late father, chief Vincent Kamara, a native of mende district in the Northern province of Sierra Leone, was the general Manager of Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.)

According to my father, This money was the income accrued from mining co-operation over draft and minor sales Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of major Paul Ko romah and the combined forces of ecomog peace keeping operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the rebels. 

My father had already made arrangement for his family, my mother and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our personal effects.

My father deposited the fund for the safe custody until after the war when he will join us. During the war in my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of the targets looted and killed My father including other top Government functionaries Were attacked and killed by the rebels because of his relationship with the civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

As a result of my father's death, and with the news of my uncles involvement in air crash, dashed our hope of survival. The untimely deaths cause d my mothers heart failure and other related complications of which she later died in the hospital After we must have spent a lot of money on her.

Now i am alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. Without any relation, i am now like refugee sandorphans, My only hope now is in this fund which my father deposited in the BANK.

To this effect, I humbly solicit your assistance in the followings ways. To assist me transfer this money out of this country so all what i needed from you is to furnish me with your banking information and your persoanl contact so that i will go and submit it to the bank in order to effect the transfer on your destin ated bank account and also make a good arrangement for a joint business investment on my behalf in your country, secure a collage for my self in your country to further my education which i stoped during the war.

And to make arrangement for my travel w i th you to your country after you have transferred this fund. Most importantly. The whole documents issued to my late father during the deposit is with me.

I beg to concede 15 % of this money to you for your efforts assistance. 
Best regards.

Juliet Kamara.
