OpenType is a compromise designed by an industrial consortium
that has lost much of its original power by being dumbed down
to were it typically is no more than a wrapper for either a Type 1
or a TrueType font.

Plus, as discussed before, many of it's potentially more
powerful features (such as glyph substitution and clever kerning)
are of no use to TeX, actually are a problem for TeX, and are not
needed by TeX, since TeX already does some of those things.

Such things have existed since about 1990 in BSR's Textures and
Y&Y's TeX.   And yes it really is great.  But it is a constant struggle
dealing with the rest of the TeX world that works a different way.
