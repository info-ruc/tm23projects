Dear Marjorie,
With financial and technical support from the Maine Mathematics and
Science Alliance, my elementary school started a pilot Lesson Study
project last year, and, though we struggled at times, we know we have
tapped into a process that could transform our district. Two of us have
been very busy this summer getting our research act together so that we
can make a presentation to the faculty and structure all (or most, anyway)
of our staff development resources around lesson study in the coming year.
 To enhance my credibility a little, I'm also off the Japan for three
weeks in October with an FMF group to learn more about the structure and
culture that support lesson study.

I have my own thoughts about lesson study and school improvement, but I'd
love to hear how you are connecting lesson study  with Mike Schmoker and
Rick DuFour, whose work our administrative team is familiar with.
Thanks.

--Tom Eismeier, Principal, Pond Cove School, Cape Elizabeth, Maine.
