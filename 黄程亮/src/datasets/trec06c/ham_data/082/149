 ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR/CEO
Dear Sir/Madam 

                       BUSINESS NEGOTIATION
With due respect and humility I write you this letter with the belief that
you would be very much obliged to assist us. Since we have no place or
person to turn to for assistance, I feel it is very necessary to bring to
your notice, the problem we are going through,now,I am very optimistic
that you owe a moral obligation
to look into our plight and come to our rescue, thus my writing to you.

I am MRS. REGINA NJOVA, the Wife of the late
DR.FRANCIS NJOVA of the blessed memory. Prior to my husband's assasination
by the Rebel forces loyal to Major John Paul Koromah, he was the
Director General, National Gold and Diamond Mining Corporation in Sierra
Leone.

Two days before my husband was assasinated,he
instructed me and my children (Mr. Justin and Evelyn Njova) to move out of
Sierra Leone immediately before the powerful Ecowas Mobilization Group
(ECOMOG) forces intervened which eventually resulted into a brutal civil
war. I and my children managed to escape to
Johannesburg the Republic of South AFrica by ship through the help of my
husband's friend who is a trawler. We came to Johannesburg with some
valuables including a cash sum of $16.5m(SIXTEEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY) in boxes which I deposited with a
Security company here in Johannesburg , with my first son's name (Justin
Sankoh).

For your information, we did not disclose the real
contents of the boxes to the Security Company and we do not wish them to
know this under any circumstances.Rather, we deposited the boxes as
containing family valuables.

Meanwhile, I want to leave Johannesburg entirely
with this money for investments in your country
because of the unstable political situation in my
country and mostly for the future of my children.

I want you to please assist us in claiming these boxes from the Security
Company, deposited the funds in a local account here in your name and
order the Bank to transfer the funds to your country.You should also
source for good investments opportunity so that we can invest wisely in
your country when the fund is finally confirmed in your account.

We have in mind to reward you handsomely for your
assistance with at least 20% of the total sum. If
there should be any incidental expenses on your side,an amount not
exceeding 5%would be given to you an additional reward.Please as soon as I
hear from you, I will forward my son's temporary telephone number in
Johannesburg for you to speak with him immediately to enable us proceed in
earnest towards retrieving the boxes and transferring of the funds into
your account.
There is no risk in this transaction since we are the bonafide owners of
the valuables.

Please ensure that no one else knows about this
money;it is only myself, my son and you that knows
about it.

May God bless you as you assist us.

Yours sincerely,

MRS. REGINA NJOVA
