No. 300 Bol Ahmed Way, LAGOS - NIGERIA 
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 
ATTN: President/ C.E.O 


I am the Chief Medical Doctor and close confidan of Mrs. Maryam Abacha,
the former first lady and wife of the late Gen.Sani Abacha, the former
head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces of the Federal
Republic of Nigeria. S

She (MRS. M. ABACHA), has as a result of the trust and confidence, she
has in me mandated that I search for a reliable and trust worthy foreign
partner, who will help receive some funds which she had in cash totaling
US$35M (Thirty Five Million United States Dollars only) into a  personal, 
company or any reliable foreign bank accounts within or outside your
country. Since the death of her husband the present government has been
saizing all the family properties as all their personal and family Bank
accounts within and outside Nigeria have all been frozen by the Nigerian
authorities. (I would refer you to the website of Weekly Tell magazine:
WWW. TELLMAGAZINE.com of November 23, 1998 page 25,and another edition of 
TELL WEEKLY  MAGAZINE of October 11 1999, Page 10 captioned the tyrants
son, for further information About this money and the ABACHAS) 

This money in question has however, been clearly moved in defaced form
and Deposited with a security company that has branches in Asia, Africa,
Europe and various parts of America. It may also interest you to note
that she (MRS. ABACHA) and her family have, Since then inception of the
present democratic government, been placed Under partial house arrest,
with their international traveling passports seized.Thus we seek your
assistance to help clear the money from the security company into your
account, she has promised to give you 30% of the total sum. 

Note that this transaction involves no risks what so ever, as you will
have no dealing with my country, Nigeria. 

Rather you will deal directly with the Security Company, which is based
where the money is right now. 

Let me have your confidential Tel/Fax numbers in your response to this
proposal. I shall let you into a complete detailed picture of this mutual 
beneficial transaction when I have received your anticipated positive reply. 
Reply to this e-mail address: drbol_ahmed@asorock.com or give me a call:

This matter should be treated as urgent and 
Confidential!)
