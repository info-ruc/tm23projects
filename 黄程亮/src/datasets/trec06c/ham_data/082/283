ATTN:SIR,

SUBJECT: APPLICATION FOR A CO-PARTNER
Greetings.
Having for some time past searching for one that could
help me out of my present need hence the application.
I am Leon Memel, the son of the late Djobo Memel. He
was a wood researcher and wood technologist.He was
into the production of panels for use in housing and
furniture industries made from locally sourced
binders; Wood cement particle board production from
wood and cement; Production of particle board from
agricultural residues such as cotton stalk, maize
stalk, elephant grass, rice stalk and eupatorium;
Production of ceiling board and roofing sheets from
100% locally sourced raw materials especially sawdust
and the use of wood as wall and floor tiles.
As a wood researcher and wood technologist I would
want to know if you could assist me to come over to
your country for further studies and eventual
investment into the ereas of my specialization.I would
also want to know if you could assist me to come over
with the fund that my late father made out for me,
US$10 million, hence his advice on foreign investment.
Should you be willing to accomodate me on this,please
let me know on what terms.
I count on your assistance.
Yours Sincerely,
Leon Memel.
