I've looked at playing w/ Bakoma TeX a couple of times---actually had it
installed on my pen slate before a virus required reformatting everything.

My big problem with its OpenType support would seem to be:
>Any font type can be used for any output device/format.
>This feature is supported by automatic font conversion
>between font formats when needed.

We really need (or maybe just, ``I want'') a direct/native solution
(which is to say a successor to TeX) so that such conversion isn't necessary.

It's linked to from www.tug.org last I checked---it's a TeX
implementation for the Mac OS (System 7.5.1--7.6.1---it does _not_ work
with the GX extension for Mac OS 8--8.6) which uses QuickDraw/GX and
enables native use of QuickDraw/GX fonts (predecessor to OpenType w/
lots of nifty capabilities). Shareware from www.sil.org
