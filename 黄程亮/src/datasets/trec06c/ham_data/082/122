Some of the Web pages are behind; I'll make sure that the OpenType section
is added.

Basically, OpenType is supported by the VTeX compiler (BOTH in the commercial
and the free versions); the Windows version visual font configuration tool
(which
manages/makes TeX support files also handles OpenType.  
The support in the compiler is totally transparent; as long as the configuration
lists a font as OpenType, it is handled.
