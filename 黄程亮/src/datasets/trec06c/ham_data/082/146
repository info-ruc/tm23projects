Dear

I am Tayo Samsudin, Retired Chief Accountant of the
Kenya Central Bank. Kenya is a picturesque East
African Country widely known for its abundance of wild
game, safaris, and Tourism ; which is still a major
foreign exchange earner for the Kenyan economy.

As you are aware, the Central Bank of every Country
acts as the Bankers’ bank. However, a few high
networth individuals and corporations routinely
maintained A/Cs with the Kenya Central Bank.

And so, in September 1997, a multimillionaire  Oil
Magnate, Ilic Novko from Bosnia/ Hezegovina opened a
time (fixed) deposit A/C in the Kenya Central Bank,
and I was privileged to act as his A/C
supervisor/manager. The opening balance was USD54
million. Unfortunately, the Kosovo crisis claimed his
life and that of his entire family! I spent years
tracing his next of kin but it was a deadend!

A few years before my retirement, I decided to make a
perfect plan to transfer this money out abroad. Using
a complicated system of shortfall deposits, I withdrew
this money and placed it in a holding A/C. The ONLY
problem is that by law, Kenyan indigenes are NOT
allowed to transfer out this volume of money abroad!
There are legal restrictions which will stop any
attempt by me to single handedly transfer this money
abroad…

I therefore need your help!  It is simple! There will
be no risk and no illegality involved. All I need is a
willing foreign partner who will agree to help me. 
How?

I have concluded arrangements to lodge the money into
an online Bank in Kenya, and from there, the money can
be transferred to any Bank of our  choice. But as I
mentioned earlier, I am handicapped because I am a
Kenya national. If you agree to help me, then please
send me your full name so that I can “ESTABLISH” the
ONLINE BANK A/C IN YOUR NAME…That way you will be able
to personally transfer the money out to any hidden A/C
of our Choice, WITHOUT YOU TRAVELLING TO ANYWHERE!
ALSO, YOU WILL NOT SIGN ANY DOCUMENTS FOR ANY ASPECT
OF THE TRANSACTION!

This is how it will work.
Step 1- I will Establish/Activate  the online A/C in
your name and lodge the money now total USD55.7million
( inclusive of interests) into the Account.
Step 2  I will give you the Account Access information
which will include :-

 (a)  Customer Name

 (b)  Customer ID

  ©  Security Code

 (d) Account Number

 (e) Amount in US$

Step 3  Once you have been given the A/C access
information as per above, you will then be in a
position to wire transfer out all the money to ANY
A/Cs of our choice! AND YOU DO NOT NEED TO GIVE ME OR
ANY ONE YOUR A/C INFORMATION BEFOREHAND; ONLY YOU WILL
KNOW AND USE YOUR CONFIDENTIAL A/Cs DETAILS TO MAKE
THE WIRE TRANSFERS YOURSELF!  The best part is that
you will do this using your personal computer, in the
comfort of your home!

I hope this will be an enduring partnership, because 
I will need your help to check out investment options
for me;  The money will be shared on the ratio of 
50/50
If you are interested, please contact me immediately,
giving me your FULL NAMES, TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS ,
and I will get back to you.

Regards,

Tayo Samsudin
