Hi,

I'm very new, but very interested, in lesson study. Specifically I'm 
interested in seeing some lesson plans that have resulted from a lesson 
study. I've looked at the ones on the Lesson Study web site, but would like 
to see some there were developed here in the US rather than ones translated 
from Japanese.

Thanks, Terri
