Well, TeX typesets according to the metrics in the TFM. It takes
care of kerning and ligature substitution (and quite complex ones
are possible in TeX 3.0 and later).

Now if the output/display/print system takes output from TeX and messes
with it by, for example, combining characters and replacing them with
ligatures, then the space taken on the line changes.  You can compensate
for this by adding letter spacing between letters, but of course this
is undesirable.  It may not be visible in benign cases, but is just the
wrong thing to do.  TeX should be in complete control of layout.

Plus what it the point? TeX already does kerning and ligatures.
In fact, if TeX knows about the ligatures in the font (as it should from
the TFM) file it will already have made the replacements and no new
ones will be triggered in the font. So then it "just works" but clearly
there is then no benefit to OpenType, the OT font is used by TeX just like
any other font.

And if you are looking for Unicode as the justification for using OpenType
keep in mind that you can use Type 1 and TrueType fonts with
large character sets just as well (from applications other than TeX).
There is no advantage to OT here.

In some TeX systems you can access
arbitrary characters in a font by reencoding it using an encoding vector
you design.  But you are still limited to 256 per font in TeX.
It's just you can choose which 256 glyph "window" into the font
you want to see.  To conveniently get more you need a 16-bit version
of TeX such as Omega.

Well, yes, but those widths are the same as those in the TFM file
(or should be). So no change should occur at this stage.

I doubt it actually works as described.  I bet it simply puts them down
on the line exactly as TeX dictates.  If it didn't, it shouldn't be called TeX!

Could you explain this a bit more?  Do you mean Adobe typesetting software?
Or ATM? Or Acrobat? Or the way fonts work in Windows and on the Mac?

You don't normally need a hi-end machine for TeX, since most
implementations can typeset the multi-hundred page TeX book
an a very small number of seconds.  Also, a "hi end" windows
machine costs *very* little these days. Certainly your employer
could justify it. It would cost a lot less than a few hours on tex-fonts :-)
