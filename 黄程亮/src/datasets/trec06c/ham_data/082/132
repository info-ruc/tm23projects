I've just finished adding ct and st ligatures to Adobe Garamond at home.
I believe I have two slots left in the italic font---one of these will
go to an fj ligature I made a while back. That leaves the possibility of
adding one additional alternative character / ligature beyond those
already installed, which means the alternate Q with long tail can make
it, but nothing after that---is that to be the full tally of quaint
ligatures in TeX?

I'm working on a typeface design which has all of those, plus ft, ll and
a couple of others---I'd really like to be able to use them
transparently in TeX without jettisoning accented characters &c.
