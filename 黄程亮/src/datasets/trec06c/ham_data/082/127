(Berthold, this is somewhat added to from my private reply to you, but
the substance is the same)

I don't see why / how TeX could care about things changing after it's
done looking at things.

As I understand it in TeX/GX, when the page is shipped out, where each
line would
normally be written to the .dvi file, it's instead passed to the
QuickDraw/GX Line Layout Manager which sets said characters to that
width according to the rules in the font(s). Apparently this is an easy way
to do this since TeX is so resistant to doing letterspacing which would
interfere with substituting (for example) a ct ligature with a the ct characters.

So rather than doing this ``under the hood'', one way to achieve this is
by latching onto TeX's output and resetting it somewhat so as to use
OpenType fonts according to OpenType rules---I don't see why this would
be a difficult thing to ``bolt-on'' to pdfTeX, modulo the difficulty of
parsing the OpenType font rules.

I've read the bit in _Digital Typography_ about the difficulties of
extending TeX to larger character sets, and've looked over Omega a
couple of times, so I've some inkling of the technical difficulties
involved in doing this directly in TeX. However, I'm working up towards
a long-term personal project
which will need something like to these capabilities, and so am
investigating how to do this sort of thing in TeX, or something like to
it (one alternative I'm looking at is CCS, a proprietary batch
pagination system which my employer developed a while back), because I
simply can't stand Adobe's ideas of user interface and can't justify
purchasing a new / high-end Mac or Windows machine.
