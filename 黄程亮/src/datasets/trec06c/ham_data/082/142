I agree.

Yes. I also find it very useful to have the language feature tag ('language system tag'). Then you can have correct 'ch', 'ck', etc. ligatures when german is the current language but not in english where it's useless (and like the 'fi' in turkish, etc.pp.). Not to mention the 'hlig' feature tag.
