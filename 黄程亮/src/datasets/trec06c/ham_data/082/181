(re: TeX/GX shifting words slightly when contextually placing ligatures &c.)

>What about a \parbox, a framed box or underlined text?

boxing shouldn't be an issue, since it seems to only be necessary to
shift things to even out word-spacing if a ligature replacement has
altered a word's length---beginning / end of the line should stay the
same (unless there's a boundary ligature which is being inserted). 

People who under-line deserve what they get.

>What about carefully positioned accents?

One of the advantages of QuickDraw/GX is that one encodes accents with
their characters into a single glyph in the input stream.

>What about multiple columns?

See above.

>What about math formulae?

I'm unaware of any QuickDraw/GX fonts suitable for setting mathematics
other than the Computer Modern variant bundled with TeX/GX

I'm still digesting everything everyone else has said, and have learned
a lot---really appreciate Lars' pointer to the relenc package.

Will try to do a summary (hey! could be an article for Tugboat!) and
post to this list, then maybe to comp.text.tex for wider discussion?
