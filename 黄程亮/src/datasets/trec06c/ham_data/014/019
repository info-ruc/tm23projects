No advanage to them (i think) because u cant use the 2k eeprom with the
handyboard in 0C config settings, its just that we have a lot of them and
would like to put em to good use.
>From adrian's msg I see that setting the config must be done in the first 64
cycles, my question
is how do u do this?? what program will set this chip??could someone plz
explain just the steps we need to take to achive this,

Thanks,
Quinn Marshal
