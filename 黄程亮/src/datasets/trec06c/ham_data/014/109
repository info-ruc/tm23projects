Hey! We've built a play pen for our robot and plan on showing it to
everyone who wanders past our display at the Adventures in Super Computing
expo on the 22nd.  It will be vooming around the box preferably from like
7:30 to 9. My problem is that our robot will only run for about half an
hour straight.  Is there any way to make this more besides just having
like 4 or 5 handyboards with the same program in them?

BTW, the play pen looks real cool.  abou;t a 2 1/2 foot cube painted white
lined almost completly with AOL CDROMS with reflective side out.  

-R.
