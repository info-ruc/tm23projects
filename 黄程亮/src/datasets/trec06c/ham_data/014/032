One of the more common problems with the somewhat larger packages
that the Dallas memories come in is pin bending. Remove the
memory and look carefully to see if one of the pins has been bent
out of shape.

If you have one Hboard where it works and one where it doesn't
you can check the signal lines for chip select and write to see
if they are functioning correctly.
