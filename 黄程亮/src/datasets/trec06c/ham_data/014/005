Hi Fred,

thanks for the answer. Oh yes I try'd all, that is possible with the
pcbug342 but without success. A very good tip comes now from Adrian Susianto
about the "64 cycles" after reset (thanks Adrian). I remember, that I read
about this in a data book years ago and I hope, this is the solution. Today
I loaded the IC 3.2 from Newton Labs and I hope the E2 will work soon (with
CONFIG at 0x0C :-)).

Good luck

Erwin
