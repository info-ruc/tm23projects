Subject: CONFIG reg of "E2"
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi to all !

Last week, I sent a interesting text of a motorola application (found at
http://www.mcu.motsps.com/lit/faq/as-79.htm), concerning the problem
with the CONFIG reg of the 68HC811E2, unfortunately, there is no
reaction til today. This application says, that the CONFIG of the "E2"
displays in the bootstrap mode NOT the real value ("1"s instead of
"0"s). The problem is, that the HBDL loader checks the CONFIG value and
read the value 0xFF instead of 0x0C (see above). Is there a solution for
this problem ?

Thanks.

Erwin
