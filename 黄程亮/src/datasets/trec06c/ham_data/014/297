Subject: polaroid sonar problems
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/enriched; charset="us-ascii"

We continue to progress on our first robot here at Northwestern but have run into a problem with our sonars.  We have run out of solutions to try and would appreciate any help from people experienced with the polaroid sonar modules.


Our sonar is hooked up to our Handy Board following the "offical" instructions. The unit itself is mounted on an acrylic stand where it is pressed into place to hold it.  We have also loaded the code as it appears on your website:


http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/Projects/handy-board/software/sonar.html


Unfortunately, when we execute the program all that we get on the display are random numbers (usually around 800 and 1125).  It makes no difference how far away we are from the wall we are trying to measure.  


Our real probelm seems to be to get the correct echo to trigger the timing loop.  As it stands, a count of 800 corresponds to a distance of .22 ft which is closer than the board can measure and much closer than our wall.  Have you seen this problem before?  Do you have any advice on how to correct it?  


Thanks for your help.  If you need more information please e-mail me and I will get it to you asap.
