Generally, you can get cheaper servos from just about anywhere else than Tower
hobbies.  The cheapest, but good enough, is Hitec or Cirrus. Tower's Hitec
price is not good. Cirrus line(Hobby Shack's line) is cheaper than Hitec.
 Check www.hobbyshack.com.  Or, check model airplane magazine for other mail
order for Hitec servos.  I saw Hitec HS-300BB (standard/ball bearing) for $9.99
advertised in one of these magazines.

Local flyer from Hobby Shack advertises standard servos CS70 for $6.xx (limit
4) during the month of April. I have put them on my airplane with no problem,
yet :)
