CRAPOLA!  NEVERMIND!  I was wrong and thinking of the bridged version (the one I use here. . .)
SORRY, MY BAD.

	Each socket on the handyboard will control 1 (ONE, UNO, UN. . .) 
Wirz _non-bridged_ 18200 board.  Since the non-bridged version can control 2 
motors, this give you 4 motors total.  Sorry about the confusion.  You can wire 
them up exactly as I specified in my first email.
