<FontFamily><param>Courier New</param>We've used the Wirz boards with great success here at Washington University. 
 I can answer both of your questions at once, since they're the same thing.




YES.  Take the drivers off the handyboard, because now the wirz boards will 
connect to those sockets.  If you have the bridged 18200 board, then each 
socket can control 2 boards.  If you have the non-bridged version (ie, the wirz 
board will control 2 motors independently) then each socket connects to two 
boards.




Here's how the pinnouts go for the non-bridged version:




Wirz Board Connector: 		L293D Pin:

---------------------------------------------------------
--------

3 (M1 PWM)			1 (Chip Select 1)

4 (M2 PWM)			9 (Chip Select 2)

5 (M1 Brake)		No Equivalent (Use a digital 	
					output to brake the motor, 
					or tie it low)

6 (M2 Brake)		same

7 (M1 Direction)		2 (input 1, dont need in2)

8 (M2 Direction)		10 (input 3, dont need in4)

9 (M1 Thermal)		none (goes high when chip

						overheats)

10 (M2 Thermal)		same

11 (M1 Current)		Analog signal of current draw

12 (M2 Current)		same




	If you have the bridged 18200 board, then for each 
motor use a single board per motor.  In the bridged 
version the M1,M2 pins are connected, so use whichever 
ones you want.  Just connect the first board to the M1 
L293 equivalents and the second to the M2 equivalent 
pins.




	Hope this helps!!!
