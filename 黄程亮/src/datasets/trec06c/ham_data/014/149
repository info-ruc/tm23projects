After driving all my robots with step motors, I finally decided to try
driving one with DC motors.  I got a couple of the lego gearmotors, and
mounted them on my robot with belts driving the wheels at a reduction ratio
of about 1.5:1, and have been doing some experimenting with the different
speeds.  
I am very surprised at the lack of change between speed 11 (which is the
slowest speed that will actually make the motor turn), and speed 100.  As
near as I can tell there is an 18 rpm difference between speed 11 and speed
100.  The difference is so small that I can't see any difference when I run
my robot across the floor at any speed.  (given that speed 11 results in
183 rpm at the wheel, that is less than a 1% change!)
Has this been the case with any of you?  Am I doing something wrong?  I
don't want to have to go back to step motors!  Please email me with your
experiences!

Note: I am using IC 3.2, but I don't know if the new 'smooth pwm routines'
are in there.  Anybody know how I can tell?  and if they're not, how do I
implement them?

thanks for any insight you can give me.
