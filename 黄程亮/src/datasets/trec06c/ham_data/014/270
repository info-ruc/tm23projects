Subject: Handyboard simulator

Hello, I was wondering whether anyone knew of a Handyboard simulator.  I am
working on a group project where each person develops code in C using IC for
the Handyboard.  The problem is that we have only one handyboard and thus
only one person is able to compile and test their code at a time.  This is
very inconvinient as we are in physically different locations.  Is there a
simulator which will compile your C code and then show a realtime ouput of
the different motor ports while simultaneously reading the digital and
analog input ports and running your code.  Is there perhaps a retail package
or something in the works?  If not, how hard would it be to create one.
Thanks in advance for any help.
