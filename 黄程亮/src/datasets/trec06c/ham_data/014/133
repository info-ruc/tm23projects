I just wanted to write to you guys to tell you how great Ephedra Max works for me. I’ve been over-weight most of my life and refuse to diet. I want to eat real food, not diet stuff. Your pills let me loose the weight without eating salads every day and I can’t thank you enough. I feel so much better. I might not be skinny (yet), but I’m not fat anymore
