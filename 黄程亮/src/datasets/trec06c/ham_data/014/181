Does your while loop have a break(); statement. I have an idea that this may be necessary in some situations.

I forgot to mention...
The process has a while(1){...} loop in it.
..if that does anything.

Does anyone know if you can call a process from within another process?
I keep getting a RUNTIME ERROR 01 when trying this.

Even calling it from a function, other than main(), gives me this error.

Thanks for any help.  :)
