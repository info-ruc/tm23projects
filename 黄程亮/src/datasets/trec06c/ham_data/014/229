Subject: Are these codes proprietary

Hi: 

I was wonderig if the codes such as analog(), digital(), process() etc
are
proprietary. If not how can I see the C/assembly version of them. 


I need them to learn how Motorola 68hc11 assembly works and also I am a
bit curious. 

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
