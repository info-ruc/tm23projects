Anthony,

A easier way to get 8K of EEPROM memory is to use Microchip Technology
25C640 Serial SPI EEPROM Memory. This is a 8 pin DIP device with a built in
SPI interface. Cost is about $3 each.  I wrote a simple application note to
connect to a HB with IC program. I had used a 25C160 (4K) device b4 the
25C640 (8K) was available. The ap note still applies though.  

The ap note can be downloaded from my web site under Design & Ideas.

I had thought about doing a design similiar to yours a while back but was
flipping through a Microchip data book and saw the 25xxxx series of SPI
memory. Was actually quite surprised when I found out how inexpensive they
were!
