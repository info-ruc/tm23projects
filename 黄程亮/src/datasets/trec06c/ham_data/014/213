1.  please read the Appendix B documentation in

http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/techdocs/

which explains this in more detail than the FAQ.

2.  you must the even-numbered Yx signals for output latches.  Since
Y6 is taken (by the on-board latch for the motor drivers), you're left
with Y0, Y2, and Y4.

3.  To set the bits in a latch connected to Y0, all you do is write a
byte anywhere in the 0x4??? memory range; e.g., "poke(0x4000, 0x55)"
sets every other bit.  That's all there is to it.
