1. The freeware version of IC had a command ('mem' if me recollection is
correct) that returned the amount of free memory in the HB, but that
command doesn't seem to be available in the most recent commercial version.
 is there some other command that I can use to perform this function?

2. Is there a way I can re-synchronize the handyboard with IC without
exiting and restarting IC?  (does this happen automatically when I hold
down the 'start' button when I turn on the HB?)

Thanks,
-patrick
