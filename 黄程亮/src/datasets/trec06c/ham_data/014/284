Hello All,

Some time back I sent a message to the HandyBoard list to enquire if 
anyone had a machine code programming monitor operating system for 
the HandyBoard, similar to the Buffalo Monitor on Motorolla's EVB 
boards.
(The Buffalo system allows downloading of S19 machine code 
routines, via a terminal program, and allows various machine code 
debugging routines)

Apparently the answer was NO, but what also arised was that others 
were interested in such a system as well.

Well, I have developed a limited Buffallo system for the Handy Board, 
I am using it in my Microprocessors class now.

If anyone is interested, they can download it from my web page at:

http://132.234.46.5/programs/index.shtml

The Buffalo routine, and a word document describing the routine is 
included.
Also, my Editor, Assembler, and Download program shell can also be 
obtained from the web site.
