but I tryed this already and without success. The hbdl loader says "Invalid
CONFIG reg (0xFF) Try again" and when I check the eeprom area with PCBUG11,
it is already there. I think, the E2 has a special protection for the CONFIG
----------

Hello ...

I'm not mastering the 68HC11 family, but I have made a project to access the
EEPROM and CONFIG register of 68HC811E2.

There is a protection in CONFIG register on every 68HC11 E family.

To access the CONFIG (programming the CONFIG), you must remove the protection
first.
Erasing/Programming the CONFIG register follows the same procedures as that used
for the EEPROM including bulk/byte/row erase.

In normal operating modes, EEPROM and CONFIG registers are protected out of
reset, and the user has 64 E clock cycles to unprotect any of blocks that will
require programming or Erasing. The 68HC811E2 and other E types family use BPROT
register (Block Protect Register) to protect the CONFIG register.

The BPROT register bits can only be cleared during the first 64 E clock cycles
after reset. Once the bit are cleared, the associated EEPROM section and/or the
CONFIG register can be programmed or erased in the normal manner.


BPROT register of M68HC811E2:

        bit 7   bit 6   bit 5   bit 4   bit 3   bit 2   bit 1   bit 0
       ______________________________________________________________
      |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
$1035 |       |       |       | PTCON | BPRT3 | BPRT2 | BPRT1 | BPRT0 | BPROT register
      |_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|_______|


Where:

Bits 7..5    = not implemented

PTCON        = Protect CONFIG Register Bit
                1 = Programming/Erasure of CONFIG register disabled
                0 = Programming/Erasure of CONFIG register allowed

BPRT3..BPRT0 = Block Protect Bits
(see table     1 = Set bit protects a block of EEPROM against programming/erasure
  below)       0 = Cleared bit permits programming/erasure of the associated block

Example:

BPROT  EQU   $1035

       ORG   $0
       LDS   #$FF
       LDAA  #$00   ;Data for clearing BPROT
       STAA  BPROT  ;Clear BPROT


I hope it will help.
