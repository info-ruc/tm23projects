NEAR WEEKLY REPORT

April 3, 1998

MISSION OPERATIONS:

	NEAR spacecraft state is nominal.  All instruments are off.  Presently back
in GS-5 attitude mode with AIU #2 in control.

	TCM #12 completed on April 1, 1998.  Preliminary estimate from JPL/NAV is 1%
overburn.  Completed playback of all SSR data recorded since day 044
immediately after TCM #12 utilizing attitude slew and high gain contact.  It
should be noted that SDC access to MOC Front End data was once again adversely
affected during 26 Kbps SSR playback.  Further tests of SDC interface are
planned.

	Continuing preparations for AIU flight software load.  Acceptance testing
started on April 2, 1998.

	Switched from low gain to fan beam antenna on March 30.  Spacecraft commands
have not been dropped since switch to fan beam.  Dropped command problem still
under investigation.

	Supported Eros  planning meeting on April 2, 1998.  Final agenda for April 7
NAV meeting to discuss Eros scheduling has been prepared and distributed.

	Reviewed list of expected MOC hardware improvements necessary for Eros
operations with program management.

	Attended review of proposed MSI software changes on March 26, 1998. Process
for defining changes to MSI flight software in cooperation with mission
operations has been excellent.  Changes that will make operation of instrument
more efficient will be included in next release, much to the satisfaction of
the operations team.

Plans:

	First ground system test of Eros Planning and Scheduling system planned for
week of April 20.  Some instrument teams may not be able to participate due to
delays in setting up scheduling software for instrument teams.

Upcoming Spacecraft Activities:
	
	TBD: Load AIU S/W to AIU #1, switch back to #1 (pending successful 		
acceptance test)
	July: 	Flight computer software upload
	July: 	Momentum Dump testing via "Fancy Burn"
	July: 	MSI software upload
	July: 	Begin Seq_Gen (Eros scheduling software) operations with XGRS and MAG
both on.
