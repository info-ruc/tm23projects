In your message you said:
> Hello everybody,
> A few month ago, someone told us that we can use port D as an ouput. But, we'
ve just read on the Handy Board FAQ that it was not possible. So, where is the 
truth ???

where in the FAQ does it say that it's NOT possible?  If you look at
the link 

http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#digout

it explains how to use Port D as outputs.

> Help, help, help !!!!!!!
> We need 8 ouputs (and also 8 inputs) to do our project, any good idea will be
 welcome.

now, to get 8 outputs, you might have to add an expansion latch,
because you only get 4 from Port D.  There is a TO3 on the expansion
header that you can use, and PA7 on the dig input bank can be made to
be an output.  that gives you 6.  if you absolutely need the 2 more,
see the instructions prepared by Bill Coghill at
