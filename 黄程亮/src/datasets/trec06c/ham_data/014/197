Subject: >1A adapter?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello folks,

I am currently using the HB to control a robot tethered to a PC (via the
serial/charger board), as I'm using genetic algorithms to evolve
controllers.  The robot pulls about an amp (with motors, servo, sonar
etc.), and I'm running it off a 12v (3.6Ah) lead-acid battery. I don't
use the serial/charger board to charge it, but instead just stick a
car-battery charger on the battery terminals every now and then.

As this charging is time-consuming, I'm thinking why not just run power
down the tether and take the batteries out of the loop entirely for the
training phase.  So I have two questions:

1. We are warned not to use high-current adapters, as "problems have
been reported."  What problems, specifically?  I am thinking a 12v, 1.5A
adapter would suit me fine, but I'm not keen on a flaming HB.

2. If this *is* possible, the 12v adapter won't have enough juice to
charge the 12v battery, so should I unhook the battery completely or
just leave it in there?

Cheers, Skye.
