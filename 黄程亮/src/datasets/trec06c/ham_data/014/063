Im trying to build a segmented centipede-type robot. There are several
sections, each self-locomoting, connected together by a rod that will allow
the other segment to swivel up, down, left and right by about 20 degrees
each (hypothetically).

Lets say I were to connect Ninotol (AKA muscle wire) to each of the corners
of one end of one module across to the corresponding courners of the other
module

So if I actuate all 4 pieces of ninotol, the 2 objects would be held
straight together, right? And if I were to actuate the 2 on the right the
object would be turned in a right direction, right???

If the above is true, then what would happen if  I actuiated all 4 as in the
first premise? Since it cannnot fully contract all four of them to the state
it was when I only actuated 2 of them, am I damaging the ninotol? What will
this do to the Ninotol, if anything????

Thanks for bearing with me,
Hope it wasnt too confusing
Thank you!
