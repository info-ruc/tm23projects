Hello everybody,

We tried to link two Handy Board, via the RJ11 computer connectors, in =
order to make them communicate with the code we found at =
http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html .
But, when we plugged the cable, the Handy Boards began to smoke next to =
these connectors.
Does anybody know how we could link our two Handy Boards ?
If someone know how, please send us the schemes and (if possible) the C =
code to have them communicate. :)

Thanks a lot in advance. :)
OM99 & RC99

Hope the force will be with you !!!!!
