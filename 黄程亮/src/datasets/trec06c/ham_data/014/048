PS--Knowing how ephemeral web pages can be, when I see something I want for
my own archives, I use a program called SiteSnagger to save the page and
associated graphics to my hard drive automatically.  This program is
available for free download from the PC Magazine web site
(www.pcmagazine.com), utilities page.  I encourage you all to check it out.
