Does anybody know if it's possible to make a pin high and then leave it
high until I send another command to make it low?  or will I have to set up
some sort of external bistable flip flop that will save the state?

I assume I would have to use some assembly language statements embedded in
my C program- right?
any ideas on how I can make this happen using one of the unused pins on my
handyboard?  

By the way: thanks for everyone's replies on my 'DC motor blues'.
