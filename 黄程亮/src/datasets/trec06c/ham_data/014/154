I wonder if any of you have had this problem before, but 
when I try to download the pcode_hb.s19 to the handyboard, 
it seems to download okay....however, when I power-cycle the 
board, it still acts if I didn't download anything - LCD is 
blank, buzzer doesn't have any sound etc. Is it a problem 
with my HC11? (Because I already tried a new RAM 
chip) Even in DOS when I try to load the config0c.s19 file 
to it, it repeatedly tells me that "expected 0c, got 
*something* at *somewhere*" even though I already did all 
the necessary steps. As a result of this, my board is still 
1/8 assembled.... :(
