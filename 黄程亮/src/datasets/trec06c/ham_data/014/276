Subject: Miniboard, ICC11, and printf
Mime-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

I have a miniboard and I am using the free version of ICC to program it. I
did replace the standard crt.s with the one for the miniboard, but I am
unable to get printf to work. Actually, I am unable to download programs
that use printf. The sample dhry.c will not download to the miniboard. I
did create a simple program to print "hello" and that did download, but
nothing showed up on the terminal screen. I also tried the printdec
command. I did get this to print a blank space, but it was not followed by
crlf, and the data was not printed.
 
I am using win95. I used hyperterm for the terminal. It works fine with
Hexmon, so I figured the icc printf routines would work also.

Does anyone have any suggestions?


Thanks
