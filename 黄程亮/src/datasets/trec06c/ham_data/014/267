Hello, I wonder if anyone knows if I can expand the Handyboard's memory
to the maximum of 64KB simply be wiring in a 128kb SRAM (A16 unused so
it becomes 64kb) with D0-D7 to the data bus as usual and A0-A14 to the
existing RAM socket and A15 from the expansion header directly to the
RAM's A15? Would IC need any modification or anything? Thanks!
