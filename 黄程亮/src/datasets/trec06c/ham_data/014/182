Correction:  You'll also need Julian's lib_hb.c to go with it.  Again,
rename your current version first so you don't overwrite it.  Put the new
one in the libs directory where the old one was, and load it (or let it be
automatically loaded).  Along with his pcode_hb.s19, that ought to do it.

I hope I haven't left anything else out :)
