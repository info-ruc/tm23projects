Hello:   =20
I have a V2x compass and I was trying to hook it into my handyboard =
using Tom Brusehaver's .icb, .c and instructions as described in the
contributed section.

I have also grounded the M/S pin on the compass.  The EOC
pin is sent to the HB thru the npn transistor.

All this is discussed in the mail archive and in Tom's
description.  I still can't get the compass to work.
With V2x(), I get a constant heading of 0.
I changed the value of the global head_word to 10 and then
10 appears constantly on the LCD.  Does this mean, I am
not getting any SPI interrupts?  I don't have a logic probe,
but I did reset the Compass by grounding the reset pin for
a moment after running comp_disable(1).  There are no
improvements.
I checked the eoc line - it always reads .76 V, the SS line
(through the transistor, at its collector) reads .1 - .2 V.
I don't know if the compass is sending out any clock signals.
What am I doing wrong?  Do I have a bad compass?
Thanks for your help.
Regards,
...Ameen Suleman
