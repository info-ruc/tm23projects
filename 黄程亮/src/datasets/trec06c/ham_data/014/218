Hi Armeen,
I have the same problem as you. I thought my HB was faulty or it doesn't
work with the 68hc11E processor I use or something.
So what I did was: I wrote a very simple IC-Routine. You have to load
this program with "load v2x.c" and call the routine with "v2x();"
It is very basic but it has one advantage: it works ;) !!

This is how to connect the V2X to HB (referring to Tom's diagram):

V2X		HB

GND		GND of SPI
+5V		+5V of SPI
SS		SCK/PD4 of SPI
P/C		MISO/PD2 of SPI
SCLK		MOSI/PD3 of SPI
SDO		Digital input #7

Save this following program under v2x.c:
/* HB V2X-commands */
/* Alf Kuchenbuch 1/1998 */
/* SS=16=yellow; SCLK=8=green; PC=4=orange;;; SDO=blue=dig7 */ 
int head=0;
int v2x()
{
	int dat[18];
	int i;
	poke (0x1009,0x3c);
	/*request*/
	poke (0x1008,8+16);
	sleep(.1);
	poke (0x1008,4+8+16);
	sleep(.1);
	poke (0x1008,4+8);
	for (i=0; i<16 ;i++)
	{
	sleep(.0001);   
	poke (0x1008,4);
	poke (0x1008,4+8);
	dat[i]=1-digital(7);
	}
	poke (0x1008,4+8+16);
head=-1+dat[15]+dat[14]*2+dat[13]*4+dat[12]*8+dat[11]*16+dat[10]*32+dat[9]*64+dat[8]*128+dat[7]*256;
	printf("Heading: %d\n",head);
	return head;
}


Hopefully someone has solved the problem so we can use Tom's routines
soon!
