I would be extremely interested to see both the schematics and software
for how you were able to accomplish this!

Hello everybody,

It's been a while since my last e-mail. Thanks for all the help so far.

I've managed to connect a RadioMetrix (http://www.radiometrix.co.uk)
radio
transceiver to the Handy Board. My mobile robot (using a HB) can now
communicate with a remote PC using the radio link. If someone is
interested, I will put up a page in which I describe the connections on
both sides and the protocol.

Here's a question for someone really into IC. Are single lines of code
executed atomically? For example, process 1 executes 

a += 1;

which is probably implemented something like this:

register = a
register = register + 1
a = register

Can there be a task switch between lines 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, or are
these
instructions executed atomically?

Thanks.

Greetings,
Jan Sipke van der Veen
