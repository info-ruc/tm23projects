Hello everybody,
A few month ago, someone told us that we can use port D as an ouput. =
But, we've just read on the Handy Board FAQ that it was not possible. =
So, where is the truth ???

Help, help, help !!!!!!!
We need 8 ouputs (and also 8 inputs) to do our project, any good idea =
will be welcome.

thanks in advance. :)
RC99 & OM99

Hope the force will be with you !!!!!
