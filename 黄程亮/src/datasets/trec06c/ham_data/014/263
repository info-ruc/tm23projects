Asunto: Problems connecting 2 Handy Boards



>Hello everybody,

>We tried to link two Handy Board, via the RJ11 computer connectors, in
order to make them communicate with the code we found at
>http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html .
>But, when we plugged the cable, the Handy Boards began to smoke next to
these connectors.
Yeah, because if you see the cable, you are swapping the VCC and GND betw=
een
the boards, you know , one board is right , but the other is getting the =
12V
to GND and "viceversa".
>Does anybody know how we could link our two Handy Boards ?
You are not taking the best way. the better way is connect using the SPI
(The boards are near or far?) I haven't code for ths SPI comuncattion, bu=
t
you can see th pink book (available at mototrola site for free), and i'm
sure you don't have problem.
>If someone know how, please send us the schemes and (if possible) the C
code to have them communicate. :)

>Thanks a lot in advance. :)
>OM99 & RC99

>Hope the force will be with you !!!!!
