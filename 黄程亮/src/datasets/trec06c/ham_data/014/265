The code found at
http://www.ai.mit.edu/people/rsargent/ic/serialio.html was intended
for connecting a Handy Board to the host PC.

It is possible to connect two Handy Boards, but you must use a NETWORK
style RJ11 cable, rather than the usual TELEPHONE style RJ11.

See the FAQ, under entry "The R11 on my Interface/Charger board is
smoking hot and is turning black! What is wrong?" for more info on
RJ11 cables.
