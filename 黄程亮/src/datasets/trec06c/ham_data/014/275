Minutes weekly meeting 4/15/98
==============================

Baby-Demo:
----------
Together we went through the whole process of setting up a CHAIMS-server
and CHAIMS-client using CORBA: writing IDL-files, compiling IDL-files,
compiling and linking server, registering server etc... 

IDL-file: Though there is one IDL-file for each server, these IDL-files
only differ in the name of the server, everything else is the same. So
far, the IDL-file on which the compiler is based is another/older one
than the one used for the wrappers. 
Next steps: Hao will finalize the IDL-file as it is used by the wrappers
and send it out, so Woody can adapt the compiler output to it.

Java-RMI:
---------
The exact type for the blobs is not yet clear (Object?). But we decided
to make the interface similar to the CORBA-IDL, i.e. having several
parameters and explicit lists of name-value pairs, instead of just one
string.

Differences in ORB's
--------------------
Obviously Orbix and Omnibroker do not handle the bind in the same way.
Kazuki will send the appropriate information to Woody, so the compiler
can take care of that. We probably have to insert more information into
the repository.
 
Excerpts from the work-reports:
-------------------------------
Dorothea: Writing proposal. Writing a Java-C++ interface that converts
an ASN.1-blob into an Java-Gentype. This interface will be needed for
the RMI-Wrapper, but it could also be used by the IO-megamodule.

Catherine: Sent out specification of interface of RMI-wrappers.

Hao: Apart from the delivery of ASN.1 utilities, I worked with Pankaj to
integrate ASN.1 into wrapper. The first try failed, because IDL file
does not seem to like anything that is not CORBA native. The IDL
preprocessor made a huge fuss about the the header file of the standard
libraires such as stdio.h. We tried to get aorund it, but finally we
decided to use CORBA:Any in the IDL and map it to the generic type in
the implementation....The initial goal of wrapping a simple module will
slip. I intend to skip the simple module and wrap room-reservation
module directly.

Kazuki: I updated OmniBroker from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3.
ioModule is now CORBA server and almost CHAIMS complient.
I got new material, and it shows how to access the fields
directly in the native code.
