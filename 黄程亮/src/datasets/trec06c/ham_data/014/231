Mar,

I ran into these warnings when I was modifying sencdr0.asm.
They do in fact show a bug in the assembly code, but it's
harmless.  If you like gory details, here they are:

Near the beginning, the file defines these constants:
BASE	EQU	$1000
ADCTL	EQU	$1030	; A/D Control/status Register

BASE is the base address of the block of Handy Board registers;
ADCTL is the address of the A/D control register.

Later, to clear this register, the code does this:
LDX		#BASE
LDAA	#0
STAA	ADCTL,X

This loads the X index register with the base address and the A
register with zero, then stores the A register into an address which
is offset from the value of the X register.  The programmer gives
ADCTL as that offset, *but the instruction only allows a one-byte
offset.*  So instead of storing into $2030 (1000+1030), which is
what was asked for, the assembler truncates the offset to one byte
($30) and stores into $1030, which is what is wanted.

You can safely remove the upper byte from ADCTL (and ADR1), or you
can leave well enough alone and live with the warnings, as I did.
