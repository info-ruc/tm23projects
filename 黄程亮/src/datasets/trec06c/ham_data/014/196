I duno... I fergot. Sorry.  :(  It was a long time ago (milage-wise). I
didn't use that method of mutitaking anymore and I didn't save the old
code.

But, I don't think so, I can't imagine that would be my style.  I would
set a global variable from within the process and kill the process in
main() when the variable is set. (i.e. if(end_process1 = 1) kill(pid1);)

It was kinda baffling why it did that though.  Anyway, If I ever
recreate the error, I'll let you know.

Thanx.  :)
