I'm still problems with two boards. I'm still can download code , but never
"boot". That code work in all others board.I can't make run off course, IC.
My answer is : The downloader check every byte it download to the board from
the memory??? Or check from the serial register?
I can't understand how the downloader say "the code is downloaded" and the
that code is not here. Anyway, pls, if any have a idea or something I can
see....
Thanks
