Hi, when I compile fencdr0.asm, I get

"xxxjunk.c"(68): Warning --- Value Truncated
"xxxjunk.c"(70): Warning --- Value Truncated
"xxxjunk.c"(68): Warning --- Value Truncated
"xxxjunk.c"(70): Warning --- Value Truncated

Does everyone else get this too?
Apparently, these are only warnings and it compiles but what does this
mean?  Is it dangerous to use the program?
