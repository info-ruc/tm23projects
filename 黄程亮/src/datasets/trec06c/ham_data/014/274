The 1998 Io observing season has begun, with observations of Io 
in Jupiter eclipse (and during Jupiter occultation ingress) on 
April 7th and 9th UT, by John Stansberry with NSFCAM on the IRTF. 
The brightness of the volcanic thermal emission from the 
Jupiter-facing hemisphere, which includes Loki, appeared to be at the 
low end of the normal range, so no unusual activity was in progress.  
The next NSFCAM/IRTF observation, with luck, will be on April 25th UT.

Bob Howell at the Wyoming Infrared  Observatory has also been 
attempting Io observations, but has so far been foiled by poor weather: 
he will try again on April 16th.
