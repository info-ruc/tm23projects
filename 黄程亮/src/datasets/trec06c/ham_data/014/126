I just bought the motor driver kit from wirz electronics, and I have
finished putting it all together. My question is, do I take the motor
drivers off of the HB and put them on the wirz board, or do I leave them on
the HB.

Question 2:  Assuming I have figured out #1(see above) where do I connect
the wirz board to?  Should I be using the servo routines, or does it plug
in where the motor drivers on the HB go?

Thanks everyone,
Mike
