Subject: Hall Effect

Does any one know of a source for Hall Effect sensors? I know DigiKey sells
them, but I just want to buy a few. I don't want enough stuff to get me
upto the $25.00 minimum order. I have not been able to find them in Mousers
catalog. Can anyone suggest a source for them?

Thanks
