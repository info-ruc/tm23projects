yup, here's what's going on.  the motor percent argument controls the
POWER, not the speed.  if the motor is essentially unloaded, it will
run at nearly full speed even at a low power percentage.

if you build a gear train that makes the motor do some real work (like
carry around the handy board), then you should see a pronounced speed
difference as a result of the different power levels.
