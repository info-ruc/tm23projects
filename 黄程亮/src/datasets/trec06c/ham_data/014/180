Yes, it is possible.  It must be, 'cause I've been doing it.

You simply need to download Julian's pcode_hb.s19 (rename your other one
first) and put it in the IC31\libs directory (or whatever you call it).  IC
3.1 ought to automatically load it instead of the original version.  You'll
know when you've got it, because IC will give you a warning that you're
using an out-of-date pcode (due to the old version number in Julian's pcode).

BTW, no apologies are necessary.  Everyone on the list is more than happy to
help, I'm sure.  Good luck, Ken.
