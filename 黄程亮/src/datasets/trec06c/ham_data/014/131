I think I am a little confused by the wording of this.  I am using the
non-bridged board, so 1 socket on the HB controls how many boards? 


Thanks for all your help.  Really appreciate it!

<excerpt><fontfamily><param>Courier_New</param>YES.  Take the drivers
off the handyboard, because now the wirz boards will  connect to those
sockets.  If you have the bridged 18200 board, then each  socket can
control 2 boards.  If you have the non-bridged version (ie, the wirz 
board will control 2 motors independently) then each socket connects to
two  boards.
