Just thought I'd write a little note to everyone describing how we are
using the HB.

I've been working with Bloomington High School South in Bloomington, IN. 
About a year ago they decided to put together a Solar Bike Team to race in
the SunRayce in Overland Park, KS.  They placed 1st in their division. 
That success took them to Akita, Japan where they place 2nd overall in
their division.  A great showing. 

This year the team has added some "smarts" to the bikes.  Each bike has a
small box just in front of the handle bars that contains a HB and a second
small circuit board to interface the HB to the bike functions.  We're
monitoring things like wheel speed, motor speed, and battery current and
voltage.  With all this info we can do motor control and base that control
on the info comming in.   The HB is directly controling the motor.  I takes
the load off of the rider so he can ride.  So far it works great. The LCD
is just right to display all the info we need.  

Maybe it won't win the race this year but the kids working with it are
shure learning a lot and we should at least end up with a few style points.

My personal thanks to Fred Martin for the design and to everyone that reads
these messages and responds to them (in a positive way).  This mail list
has been quit a bit of help over the last year since we started this
project.

This years race is in Topeka, KS the end of May.  I'll let you know how we
do.
