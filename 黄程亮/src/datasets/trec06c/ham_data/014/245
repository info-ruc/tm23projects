      Hi all, Futaba servo's chatter when the pulses are not updated 
quickly enough. At best, this produces a slight buzz, at worst they 
'hunt and seek' their position a tiny bit. I don't know how fast the 
HB routines update the pulse, but standard Futaba receivers send the 
pulses about 60/sec. You can get decent performance from the servo at 
20/sec. I haven't used servos with the HB, but I have used them 
extensively with PIC's. Perhaps this is causing the problem?
