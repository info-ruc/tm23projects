Subject: Smooth PWM in IC 3.1?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I apologize for asking a question I think I've seen answered,
but I can't find it in the mail archives.

Is it possible to use Julian Skidmore's smooth PWM routines with
Newton Labs' commercial IC 3.1?  Since they use a different version
of pcode.s19 than the freeware IC, I assume the smooth-PWM modifications
would have to be applied to that, and I haven't found a way of doing
so.

Thanks
