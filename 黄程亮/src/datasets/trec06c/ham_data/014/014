Hi All,

I'm curious.  I've been watching all the stuff come through about using
a '811E2 chip in the Handyboard.  My question is: What are the
advantages of this?  I'm using E2's in my BotBoard from Marvin Green but
I moved most of my stuff to the HB because of the ease of development
and the larger memory space.  Is there an advantage of using the 2K of
EEPROM on the 'E2?

Thanks
Mike
