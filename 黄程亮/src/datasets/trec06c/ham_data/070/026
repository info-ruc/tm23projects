   Nope, the NVIDIA stuff is great.

   It's a crappy monitor but it works.  I prefer the Digiview for garden 
variety monitors and if you've got money to burn almost nothing beats the 
Sony devices, esp. if you want fast refresh rates, some of the Sony devices 
are _very_ fast.

   No.  But you will need two video cards which means one of them has to be 
a PCI card and although NVIDIA has plans to re-introduce a PCI card I 
haven't heard of it selling yet.  I'd be interested to try one of the 
Matrox Dual Head video cards, here you only have one AGP video card 
(meaning nice fast transfers to the video memory, PCI is on the slow side) 
but two monitors plug into it and it enumerates itself as two devices.
