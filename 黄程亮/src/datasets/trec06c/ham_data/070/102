   Possibly because the old code was not functioning properly.  I'd have to 
have the machine in front of me and run some tests with my photo cell to 
find out.  Without test equipment I'd be looking at the results of the 
video test very carefully, looking to see how often it found retraces when 
they were supposed to be found, if at 8.4ms it's timing almost all retraces 
out then it's more than likely the 8.4ms is spurious (which is one of the 
main reasons to switch to 2.0 code).
