Dear Professor Phillips,

Thank you for giving me permission to send you this information about Anthology
Pro, our textbook-quality custom reader service.

To save you time, I've summarized the topics I'll cover in this message:

1.  TEXTBOOK QUALITY.  We'll turn your reader into a professional-quality
anthology with crystal clear text, a paginated table of contents, and a four
color cover with a strong binding.

2.  EXPRESS ORDERING.  You can order your anthology in 5 minutes or less on the
phone or the Internet.  Your personal Production Manager will take care of
everything.

3.  ON-TIME GUARANTEE.  We guarantee that we'll deliver your anthology on-time
-- or we'll give you a $500.00 gift certificate to Amazon.com.

********************************************************************************
-->1.  TEXTBOOK QUALITY

Have you ever spent the time to compile a unique set of readings for your
course, then been disappointed with the result?  Frequently the physical quality
of the coursepacks available from campus bookstores and local copy shops doesn't
reflect the quality of the thinking and effort that went into the work.

Now you have an alternative.  AnthologyPro will produce your custom readers as
textbook-quality paperback books.  We start out by obtaining first-generation
masters of all the readings you've chosen (chapters from various textbooks and
articles from journals, magazines, newspapers, etc.)  We reproduce these
contents digitally for crisp, clean pages.  We create a table of contents, add
the four-color cover of your choice, and finish the book with a strong, perfect
binding (like any other high quality paperback in a bookstore or library.)  

How can we do all of that without charging your students more than they'd pay
for a conventional coursepack?  AnthologyPro is part of Courier Corporation, the
fifth largest book manufacturer in the U.S.  Our custom reader service takes
advantage of economies of scale (we produced nearly 300 million books last year)
and experience (we've been at it for more than 175 years) to bring an
excellent-quality reader to your students.

or call me toll-free at 1-877-408-5024.

********************************************************************************
-->2.  EXPRESS ORDERING

You can order your anthology in 5 minutes or less.

Once you've spent the time to compile a unique set of readings for your course,
the last thing you want to do is spend more time filling out a long
bibliographic ordering form.  With AnthologyPro, there are no forms -- just tell
a real person what you want to include in your book.  You can do it by phone,
fax, or email.  Or if you prefer, we can even drop by your office to pick up
your reading list.  If the information is less than complete, no problem.  We'll
do the research, free of charge, to fill in the holes.

After you order, the process is just as relaxed and easy.  Your personal
Production Manager will take care of all the details, including clearing
copyright on all contents.  Throughout the process, your Production Manager will
keep you informed by email of major milestones (when your book goes into
production, when your books will be available to ship, how many students have
ordered, etc.).

********************************************************************************

-->3.  ON-TIME GUARANTEE 

We guarantee that your students will have the material in their hands the first
day of class so they can begin your reading assignments right away.  If we don't
deliver on time, we'll give you a $500.00 gift certificate to Amazon.com

How can we do it?  When you order an AnthologyPro reader, we provide you with
free First Day Packs.  These mini-books, which include your first week's reading
assignments, are mailed to you well in advance of class start.  They also
include simple, clear instructions showing your students how to order the
complete anthology online or by phone -- and we guarantee that your book will be
in stock and will ship within 24 hours.

For more information about our guarantee, please visit
http://www.anthologypro.com/br/apgu.asp?br=4a or call me toll free at
1-877-408-5024.
