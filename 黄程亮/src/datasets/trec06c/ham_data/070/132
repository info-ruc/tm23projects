I don't know why HBDL doesn't work sometimes.

Can you try dl.exe.  It's part of the stock Interactive C
distribution.

There are command line switches to tell it to use COM2.  You'll have
to throw away the PIF file that comes along.  Sometimes it works
better in full-screen mode.

Please let us know the result...
