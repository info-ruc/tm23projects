Company Update:

We sent out a newsletter on April 6th telling people we would not be able to release our 10 day weight formula until July 19th.

Well that was then and this is now!  Our product has been pushed through all the tests and is ready for release in stores on May 29th.  If you can't wait, then we are accepting early orders from our website below.
