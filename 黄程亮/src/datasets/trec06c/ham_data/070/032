Dear All,

While we are on the topic of monitors, I'm interested to know if anyone has 
had any experience with the Monivision variety. I'm looking at them 
because, firstly their smallest screen size is 29" (size does occasionally 
matter) and they also permit TV/video function (digitally compatible). The 
latter permitting the presentation of a more multimedia array of stimuli, 
such as affective film clips.

We currently use the 21" Sony Trinitron, and have found them more than 
adequate. The Monivision model I'm currently considering is the 29" 
DM-5948S XGA Data/Video Monitor (with the CT-1871 Vision Box). If anyone 
has had any experience with this model, or company, or has heard anything 
about them, I'd greatly appreciate hearing from you.

Best Regards,

Julian.
