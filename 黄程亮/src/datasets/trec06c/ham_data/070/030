Thank you. I finally got it to work, but only by having both the program
and the rtf file in the 'root' C: directory.

Regardless, this method then bypasses the 'main' DMDX screen, keeping the
experimenter from (easily) entering the subject ID, correct? (I see you can
enter it in the command line, but that would be too cumbersome for my
purposes) 

Do you know any way to get that screen but limit the choice of files?

Jerry
