Hello DMDXers.  I am a first-year graduate student in clinical psychology at 
Florida State University.  I am planning to set up a stimulus presentation 
computer that will run DMDX, and I have several hardware questions.

I am ordering a P3-733MHz with 128MB.  I want a qick graphics card and I can 
get a good price on a 32MB nVidia GeForce 2.  This card should support up to 
2048X1536 resolution and should have a refresh rate of up to 120MHz.  I have 
read over the updates on the DMDX site, and I did not see any warnings 
against using this card.  Does anyone know of any problems with it?  Are 
there any cards that would recomend over it?

I am planning to show bitmap images on a 19 inch Viewsonic monitor.  The 
card supports higher levels of resolution and refresh than this or most 
other monitors, so I don't think there will be a problem.  Are there any 
problems with this monitor?  One more question, if I set up a dual display 
(one for the experimenter, one for the subject), do I need the two monitors 
to be exactly the same model?

I appreciate any advice and guidance that you can offer.  Thank you.


Keith
