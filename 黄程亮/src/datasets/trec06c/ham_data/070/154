   OK, 2.0.03 is up on the website.  This one has the <id "joystick" 10,1> 
fix and an RTF control word override.  Word problems are patently just not 
going to go away so there is now a check box to override the errors that 
result from unknown RTF control words being in the RTF file.  Checking this 
option could possibly cause an item file to display in an unintended 
fashion because the control word that is being ignored did actually mean 
something, however DMDX already supports most of the obvious text 
formatting that windows itself natively supports so in the vast majority of 
instances checking this will simply allow an item file to be used that 
would otherwise get refused.
