I puzzled over a similar problem until I realised that I needed to
specify the video mode in the parameter line of the item file using
the <vm> keyword.  What worked was to include in the parameter line
something like (insert your own values) <vm 640, 480, 480, 24, 0>. 
The values should match those in which you ran the TimeDX video mode 
test (notice there are 5 numbers). 

If <VideoMode>  (or <vm>) is not specified then DMDX defaults to
640x480 (480) 8 bpp 0Hz  i.e. <vm 640,480,480,8,0> (thank you j.c.f. 
help file and Mike Ford tutorial). Which is j.c.f.'s point above (I 
think).
