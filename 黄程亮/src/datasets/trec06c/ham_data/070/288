Dear DMDX Users:

I would like guidance in generating DMDX item files for experiment in
learning. None of the examples on the web or in the help files shows a
learning experiment.

(I only this week took the plunge into DMDX on Win98 as my primary
experiment-running environment, so I am completely new to DMDX. I hope
you will forgive my inexperience with the system.)

In the learning experiments I run, the basic task is to learn which
stimuli get which labels. For example, it might be that the stimulus
"Sore elbow & blurred vision" should be classified as "Ailment A,"
whereas "headache & blurred vision" should be classified as "Ailment B."
Every trial is, essentially, an N-alternative forced choice, and people
learn what the correct choices are for different stimuli.

On a given trial, the following should happen:
A stimulus is presented along with a response prompt such as, "Is this a
case of A, B, C or D?" The stimulus and prompt are visible until a
response is made, or until some maximal allowed response time (e.g., 15
seconds). The response choice and time are recorded. The stimulus
remains visible after the choice response, but the response prompt is
replaced with feedback: "Correct/Wrong. This is a case of A/B/C/D. Study
this case, and press the space bar to proceed to the next case." This
remains visible for as long as the participant wishes, or until some
maximal study time (e.g., 30 seconds). When the space bar is pressed,
the study duration is recorded, a blank intertrial interval occurs, and
then the next trial begins.

How can this be done in DMDX? I've figured out how to do multiple
choices, but beyond that I'm stuck (e.g., how to leave stimuli visible
until a response is made or until a maximal duration is exceeded, etc.).

Has anybody out there done this sort of experiment in DMDX?

Thanks very much.

--John
