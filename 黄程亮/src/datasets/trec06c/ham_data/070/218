Hi all,
    I am using the free version of IC (2.860 BETA).  I have some trouble
with the assignment expression abbreviation, i.e. count += 2;.  According to
the manual, I can do:

count is declared as type int.

count += 2;
count -= 2;
count *= 2;
count /= 2;
count <<= 2;
count >>= 2;
count &= 2;
count ^= 2;
count |= 2;

which I can.  But I can't do:

count %= 2.

IC gives me an syntax error.  Did anyone try that and figure out why it
would be an syntax error?

Thanks.
