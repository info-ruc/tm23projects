Thanks to Dr. Forster and Dr. Kline for responding to my question about 
video cards and monitors.

Does anyone have any additional recommendations about monitors?  In addition 
to Sony, are there any that are especially good?  In addition to Viewsonic, 
are there any that I should avoid?

Thanks!
Keith
