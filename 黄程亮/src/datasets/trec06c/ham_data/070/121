Given the previous discussion about differences in refresh intervals 
estimated by different versions of DMDX, I think it is worth making the 
following points.

1.  On my machines, at least, the two versions give the same results.  So 
it is possible that the discrepancies are limited to particular graphics 
cards and/or CPUs.

2.  If you are worried about whether your refresh interval is really what 
DMDX reports, there is a very simple test.  Write an item file that asks 
for a frame to be displayed for 10000 ticks, and then time the display with 
a stopwatch to see whether you get the right value.  Do this 20 times and 
average the results, and then divide by 10000, and you will have a very 
precise measurement of the refresh interval.
