Re: Student Packets


Time for Fall Term student packet preparations! First thing to do is fax 
(485-6253) or email (Copy-Shop@worldnet.att.net) JUST your bibliography to 
The Copy Shop so we can get your copyright clearances completed. Even though 
it is still a few weeks before term starts we would like to get going now.  
We will work with you to get the packets set up to suit your students needs. 
Please hurry, so we can get started and have them ready by beginning of term. 
Don't forget-our prices are less than comparable to other copy companies. 
That makes it great for your students.
 
Let me know if I can help in any way, or call the Copy Shop directly at 
485-6253 and ask for Steve, Jim, or Michael. 

Thank you, we look forward to serving you again this fall.
