Subject: Is this a bad PLC socket?

Hi,

I built up a handyboard and most of it works great!
testmotor passes, testdigitals passes, even the
infrared remote detects and trnasmitts fine!
I just have one analog port, port 3 that does not
work unless I apply a little pressure to the cpu!
I looked under a magnifying glass to look for any
solder shorts.   Every analog input reads 255 except
port 4, I get 114.  If I apply pressure I get 255 and I will
be able to get a reading of 42 across a 10k resistor! But...
If I remove the pressure the port will go back to a reading of 114.
Is it a defective PLC socket? Or should I buy a PLC extraction
tool and remove the IC and reinsert it?

Anyone else run into this?

I've been thinking about running some wirewrap wire from the port 3 to
it destination, maybe a bad etch?
