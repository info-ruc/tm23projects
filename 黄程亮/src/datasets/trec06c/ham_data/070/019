   In writing version 2 I have been looking closely at things and I notice 
that the R switch (or the <RTcorrection> and <rtc> keywords) has no effect 
unless the method of display ACBIT is turned on, which the documentation 
does not state.  No one is likely to have done this, nor would they want 
to, acoustic control is bygone kludge from the dinosaur era.  Instead I 
have changed version 2 so that the R switch and the <RTcorrection> and 
<rtc> keywords can correct for target position on the screen as indicated 
in the documentation (if people still want to use ACBIT that functionality 
will be still be present).
