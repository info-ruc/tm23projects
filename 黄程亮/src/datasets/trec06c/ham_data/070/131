Last year I had a desktop Compac running Windows 95.  I used HBDL and never
encountered any problems.  We now have IBM thinkpads running Windows 2000 and
I can't get the downloader to work.  I went through the hardware sanity check
on the HB pages and com2 works and communicates with the HB nicely.  Following
a suggestion I read (somewhere), I set the transmit & receive buffers to the
minimum size available on com2.  (The 9 pin serial port is com2 on my
machine.)  I get one of two errors.  If the charger is plugged in, it looks
like the download is going smoothly, but at the end I get an error message
which says "Error at address 0x0000".  If the charger is not plugged in, the
error message is "Wrong port or board mode".

If anyone could help with this problem, I would appreciate it.
