I am running TimeDX on the Matrox G400 Dualhead, and get the following
error messages when entering the Vertical Retrace Sync Thread:

1.  DirectX reports no support for Page Flipping, so page tearing will be
used instead.

2.  SetPalette failed!  DDERR_INVALIDPIXELFORMAT (88760091) pixel format
was invalid as specified.

3.  Refresh Interval calc. failed

4.  A diagnostics dialog with a bunch of comma delimited 0s and -1s.

Finally, after going through these errors, I get the Vertical Retrace Sync
Test dialog.  Since the default values are ridiculously high for my ADI
Microscan G66 (i.e. Automatic values are 14 for sleep, 17.667 for TimeOut,
and 16.667 for refresh interval), I tune the following values:  Sleep=6,
TimeOut=8, Refresh = 

7. Again, I get the page flipping and invalid pixel format errors.  But, if
I ignore the errors, the sync thread runs.

When I try to run a rtf protocol, I get DDERR_NODIRECTDRAWHW (88760233) A
hardware only DirectDraw object creation was attempted by the driver did
not support any hardware.

These are the reasons I abandoned this hardware in the first place, and
opted to use some PCI cards... However, if I can use the Matrox and take
advantage of AGP, I would like to do so.  Any suggestions would be
appreciated.

best,

JK
