I built a simple amp using an LM386.
I attached an electret condenser mike to it.
If I power the device using a 5 V battery I get a CLEAN signal on my 
osciliscope.
If I try to power it using one the Handy Boards analog ports, the signal is 
distorted.
How can I rectify this problem? I tried some caps across the supply lines ut 
to no avail? HELP!
-Mike
