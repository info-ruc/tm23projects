   Guaranteed.

   I'm not entirely sure that method would work if DMDX was told that the 
retrace interval was 8.5ms when it was in fact 11.5ms.  Such a method 
certainly worked in the days of yore when we had a retrace interrupt with 
DM and DMTG, however I'm pretty sure it won't work now as DMDX will be 
working to make the retrace interval 8.5ms.  The only sure way (short of 
using photosensitive test equipment) is to read the documentation in TimeDX 
on timing the retrace interval and to look closely at the results printed 
in that window.  If the interval was 11.5ms when the parameters specified 
8.5ms there would be an enormous number of timed out retraces (75% or more 
would be my guess) and while DMDX operates just dandy missing upwards of 
50% of them when it's timing parameters are correct you will find that the 
times that it finds two retraces in a row at are exactly the retrace 
interval, it's likely that in the above scenario that it would never find 
two retraces in a row, if it did the intervals would be all over the place.
