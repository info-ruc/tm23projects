I was wondering if it is possible to print non-alphanumeric characters
on the display, such as the heart that is used as the heart beat
display. Is this just one of the normal ascii characters ? (e.g. heart
symbol = 03h), it would be useful if I could use the other symbols as
well.

Thanks in advance.
