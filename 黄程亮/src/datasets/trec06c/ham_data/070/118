   No, I mean that it's possible the 8.4 is completely spurious and the 
refresh interval was in fact 11.5ms.

   No.  For some reason I was never able to ascertain and that led to the 
development of version 2 the automatic retrace interval code in TimeDX 1 
could fail, it would usually display a message when this happened so I 
never particularly worried about it.  The only times I ever saw it in 
development it went away as soon as I saw it.  Then later my home machine 
would reported 8.5ms when I knew that was unlikely and that the interval 
was more than likely 12.5ms -- however by that time I was developing 
version 2 code.
