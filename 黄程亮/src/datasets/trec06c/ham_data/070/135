   Looked into the <id "joystick 1" 10,1> issue and there was indeed a line 
missing in the code (++cp;) that made an infinite loop out of the parser... 
oops.  That's fixed in 2.0.03 which isn't released yet, if someone 
desperately needs it I will release it but otherwise there other things I'm 
looking at beforehand.

   I notice with testmode 9 and my phototransistor that a 10,1 joystick 
device (mine takes 0.52ms to poll) has an sd of 0.37ms, not too shabby and 
a 10,2 device an sd of 0.5ms, very nice, just what I'd hope to see.  On a 
different note as one of the tests was running I saved a file to the shared 
up drive on that machine, RTs went from 19ms +- 1ms to 29ms... boom.  Don't 
be accessing network drives on machines gathering RTs.
