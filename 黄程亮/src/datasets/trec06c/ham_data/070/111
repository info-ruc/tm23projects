   Well that didn't take long.  DMDX 2.0.01 is up on the website, 2.0.00 
had some issues with which window wound up with the focus after an error 
message had been thrown (the whole way DMDX deals with it's multiple 
windows has changed and there were some edits I had overlooked).  If you 
wind up with a big blue screen after an error message and you haven't 
installed 2.0.01 all you need to do is to hit alt-tab and you'll get back 
to the menu window.
