Is there a complete memory map for the handyboard I can
Look at?  I'm building up a board and would like to use
the expansion port.  I am going to interface a VX1, the interface
will be different than what has been previously done. AlsoI've been
thinking about buying the a GPS module I found.
Also may want to interface other devices in the future.
Any memory map?

Also it was FUN putting togther code for Handyboard support
for Linux.  I will be putting together a tar file that
include all the libraries and all the utilities I had
to track down.
