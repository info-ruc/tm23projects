   And the article I found it in mentioned a couple of good secondary cards:

       3dfx Voodoo3 2000 PCI
       3dfx Voodoo2 2000 PCI
       Matrox Millennium PCI
       Matrox Millennium II PCI
       Matrox Mystique PCI
       Matrox G200 PCI
       TNT2 M64 PCI

   That last TNT2 M64 based one would be my card of choice.

   The article is for gamers, but DMDX is closely related to game software, 
if anything it's a little more demanding, however it doesn't care about 3D 
stuff:
