Hi!

	Zetex has a great tech page where all of the specs are listed:

	www.zetex.com

	It will have the beta values...

| Subject: IR output driver
| 
| 
| Does any one know how much current the ZTX614 NPN Darlington transistor
| (Q1 - IR output driver) can handle. I am wondering whether I can use
| this to driver a total of 5 IR leds, either in parallel or series. The
| indicator led circuitry that goes in parallel to the ir output uses a
| 1Kohm resistor with one of the 2mA leds so I am assuming that if I use 5
| x 1K resistors (one for each output) to drive the leds at 2mA (approx)
| the overall current going through the transistor should be about 12mA.
| Could someone clarify this.
| 
| Thanks
