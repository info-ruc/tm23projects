   Well, that took even less time.  I had fixed a long standing error where 
rtfparsed.txt wasn't openable after an error because the abort routines 
hadn't been called and the file mapping object was still open and therefore 
not useable, well in fixing it the millisecond callback wound up not 
getting activated...oops.  So that's fixed in DMDX 2.0.02, sorry about the 
mess.

   On the upside, I just finished running the new TestMode 9 that monitors 
RT deviations (you could just analyze the data I know, I'm not about to do 
that), primarily for use with a phototransistor and I see a standard 
deviation using the PIO-12 for input on my 400Mhz Celeron and TNT1 of 
0.29ms!  This is almost exactly what you want to see for millisecond 
accurate timing, this means that 95% of responses were within +- 0.58ms of 
each other, wahoo!
