Dear DMDXers,

I am running several different rtf files for different but related
experiments (native Chinese speakers, simplified characters; native Chinese
speakers, traditional characters; learners of Mandarin, simplified
characters;  learners of Mandarin, traditional characters; native English
speakers). I would like to make it very easy for those running the
experiments to select the right rtf file so the wrong one is not selected
by mistake, by having there be only one rtf option. (it may sound like a
no-brainer to have experimenters simply select the desired rtf file from
several in the same folder, but mistakes do happen).

I have tried doing this by putting copies of the DMDX program in different
folders, accompanied in that folder by the rtf file I want to run, and then
putting very clear icons on the desktop that shortcut to those folders. The
problem is that no matter which copy of DMDX I run, the pathway for the rtf
file it gives under 'browse'  is always the one most recently run rather
than the one it sits next to in the folder.

Does anyone know how to have a particular rtf file be accessed virtually
automatically upon running DMDX?

thanks,

Jerry
