   Ok, the preliminary release of DMDX 2.0.00 and TimeDX 2.0.01 are up on 
the website.  The old version of DMDX (1.3.01) is still available in 
DMDX1301.ZIP, I won't be deleting it any time soon as it's the only version 
of DMDX that can work on old 386 and 486 machines.  I won't be updating 
version 1 again, any fixes or modifications will be made to the version 2 
code.  The new version includes greatly enhanced (read largely re-written) 
support for multi-monitor machines (the secondary subject's display can now 
be a part of the windows desktop which it tends to be by default) and 
exclusive use of the win32 Performance Timer (read microsecond accurate RTs 
if you find an input device that accurate and basically more accurate 
timing all round).  I'm still working on it, sorting out joystick polling 
issues raised previously and other things but testing by me to date 
indicates I haven't broken anything and that RTs are in general at least 
0.3ms more accurate than they used to be so I'd like people to at least 
start testing it.  Note, you must use the new TimeDX to record registry 
settings for the new DMDX, they use different forks of the registry tree 
(so version 2 settings won't upset version 1 code).
