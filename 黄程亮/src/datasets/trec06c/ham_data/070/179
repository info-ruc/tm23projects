Subject: play wav files on HB
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

I've seen mentioned in the last few weeks something about playing wav
files on the hb, is this using the standard hardware or is there a
utility that can convert small wav files into a format playable by the
hb. I have gotten as far as playing the pink panther tune from the
music.c file in the IC2.x library but a wav file seems a bit out of this
particular programs league.
Any information would be appreciated.

Thanks.
