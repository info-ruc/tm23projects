Steve,

  The data in Y32311, the Kexue CTD data has some errors.
  Some of the data has a latitude of -4 degrees,
  while the majority is at 4 degrees latitude (no negative
  sign).  All data should be at -4 degrees latitude 
  (4 south).

  Also, the cruise has some dates from January, 1992.  The
  dates should be January, 1993.

  I confirmed this information with the PI (Ming Feng).

  Problems in the original data we received from this cruise
  was what led me to ask you for the TOGA-COARE data.  We
  probably wont get to the rest of the data for a little while.
  When we do, I will let you know anything we find.

Tim Boyer
