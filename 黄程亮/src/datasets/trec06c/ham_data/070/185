What I was actually wondering was whether there was a utility that could
convert small wav files (only a couple of seconds or so) into a format
playable by the hb, possibly using the existing tone functions using some
form of sampling. The intended use is for a small audio warning, either vocal
(obviously it would be very poor quality) or an audio tune, and as my musical
talents are nonexistant being able to convert a wav file into a tone()
compatible format would be better.
Any ideas ?

Thanks in advance
