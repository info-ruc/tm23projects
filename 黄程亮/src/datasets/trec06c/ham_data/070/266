The Expansion Board has inputs specifically for Lego sensors.  In particular,
I've used the rotation sensor and it works fine.  You simply take a lego
connector, cut the wire and put the HandyBoard connector on.  Plug it in and
you're ready to go.  You need to load the module explego.icb.  It gives you
variables like lego1_counts, lego1_velocity, lego2_counts, etc.  You simply
access these variables in your program and that's all there is to it.

We used the rotation sensors as wheel odometers.

Hope that helps.

Barry
