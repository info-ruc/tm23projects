Hi,

I found your site in webcrawler.  I am looking for websites who are
interested
in either getting listed on our website or participation in co-op programs
with us.  We are kind of in a rush to get things going for the holiday
season.

If you have a moment, please give me a call at 877-835-9308 x616.

Thank you for your time.  If this note went to the wrong person
at your company, I am sorry, I don't know which email address is the
correct
one.  I will not be re-sending you anything, and you aren't on any kind
of database.

Best Regards,

David Rubright
877-835-9308 x616
