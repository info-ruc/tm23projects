Hi.  I am still a bit worried about the discrepancy in the refresh 
intervals for the same video mode in different versions of DMDX.

>Hi. In TimeDX with DMDX 1.3, 640 x 480 8 bit colour I get a refresh value

We tested the earlier versions of DMDX with a photo-cell and were happy 
with the timings.  I shall test out the timing on other machines.

Do you mean that although in theory it could do 8.4 it very rarely achieved 
this and so the new version is giving the figure it can achieve with a high 
degree of accuracy?

Say I had a machine that gave a refresh rate of 11.9 for 800 x 600 8 bit 
colour and when I ran the Vertical Retrace Synch Thread it gave no Multiple 
Timeouts and no Certain errors but lots of Timeouts of 1 ms, then the real 
refresh rate value would have been something like 12.9?
