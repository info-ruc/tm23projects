Here is an equation that generate all prime numbers,
it is the equation in theorem 2, in the prime generator
article at  XXXX://www.firesurf.net/primes
I send it to you because publishing is long and that you may
be interested in reading it. The equation could apply
in an factoring algorithm and some expansion of the
theorems could lead to a better understanding of
the prime number structure.
