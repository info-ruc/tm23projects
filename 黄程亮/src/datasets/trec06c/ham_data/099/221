Andy, 

Program works smoothly after unmapping the space bar from REQUEST and
mapping it as a NEG_RESP. 
Thanks for your time and help !

Cheers, 
Arman

Hi Arman, 

In the DMDX help file, under DMDX help, input, I found the below info.
Looks like the space bar is already been mapped as a "REQUEST".  

   KEYBOARD
+Space REQUEST
+Left Shift NEG_RESP
+Right Shift POS_RESP

Not entirely sure what a request is, but try unmapping it first (in the
header code at top of dmdx script) using the below function.

Un-Map Request Keyword

<UnMapRequest>
<umr>

    Parameter and switch to unmap all button mappings to the request input.


Cheers, Andy.

Andy, 

I have tried to replace <mnr +Space> with <mnr +SpaceBar> and got the
following error message "Button name <+SpaceBar> not found on input
devices". Apparently, the name of space bar on the laptop is "Space".
When I use <mnr +Space> DMDX doesn't complain and executes the code.
However, when I press the space bar I get "No Response" message, indicating
that the DMDX doesn't register pressing the space bar due to some reason. I
assume that space bar has a special function in DMDX and doesn't get mapped
easily, if at all. 

If there are no other suggestions I will try to use your code as a last
resort. 

Thank you,
Arman

Dear Arman,  try changing your <mnr +Space> bit to <mnr +SpaceBar> .  I find
it odd though that your space bar is called SpaceBar, something to do with
the external keyboard?  Also, here's some incredibly ugly (and probably
incredibly inefficient) code I put together a while back that allowed me to
remap responses to the buttons of a mouse. I bet there are much nicer
examples on the DMDX list archive though. Best, Andy.
