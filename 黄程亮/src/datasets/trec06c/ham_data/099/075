Hi,


My laptop had the latest version of Windows Media Player and there was nothing I
could do to get the videos to work. 

In the archives (http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/cgi-bin/thread?message=1421802),
I found a similar problem with avi files not playing and you suggested using
something higher than Windows 98 (which is weird because my PC has Windows 98
and was perfectly happy to display the avi files---unfortunately I can't run my
experiments on my own PC).

So I tried that on another PC with XP and it works---but I had to change the
format of the avi files to be compatible with Windows Media Player Version 9. 



Thanks for your help,


Carrie
