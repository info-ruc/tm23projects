Subject: New Book on Uncertain Input Data

Uncertain Input Data Problems and the Worst Scenario Method
by Ivan Hlavacek, Jan Chleboun, and Ivo Babuska;
North-Holland Series in Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, Volume 46,
Elsevier, Amsterdam, December 2004.
Hardback, xxvi+458 pages, ISBN: 0-444-51435-X

This book deals with the impact of uncertainty in input data on the 
outputs of mathematical models. Uncertain inputs as scalars, tensors, 
functions, or domain boundaries are considered. In practical terms, 
material parameters or constitutive laws, for instance, are uncertain, and 
quantities as local temperature, local mechanical stress, or local 
displacement are monitored. The goal of the worst scenario method is to 
extremize the quantity over the set of uncertain input data.

A general mathematical scheme of the worst scenario method, including 
approximation by finite element methods, is presented, and then applied to 
various state problems modeled by differential equations or variational 
inequalities: nonlinear heat flow, Timoshenko beam vibration and buckling, 
plate buckling, contact problems in elasticity and thermoelasticity with 
and without friction, and various models of plastic deformation, to list 
some of the topics. Dozens of examples, figures, and tables are included.
