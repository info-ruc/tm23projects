Hi
 
I've made a program in which the Space key is mapped to the ABORT response (I've done this because I'm using soundfiles, and I want the subject to be able to move on to the next sound file at any stage). At various stages in the program I'd like to unmap the Space key for a couple of lines, and then remap it again to the ABORT response (this is because the subject answers a yes / no question and I don't want them to accidentally abort). I've used the command <UnMapButton Space> (umb for short),  to do this (on its own line, preceeded by a line number), but DMDX doesn't seem to like at, and gives the error response ("misplaced keyword at beginning of line"). Is it possible to unmap buttons in the middle of a program and then remap them again?
 
Many thanks
