hello-
i'm planning a study that i'll outline:
there will be a paragraph of context presented line by line, for which i 
need to record reading time for the final sentence of each paragraph. then a 
word will be presented tachistoscopically to a visual field. the subject is 
then to answer yes or no using a key pad response whether the presented word 
"goes with" the previous context.
my question is...is there a script that has been already written to use in 
DMDX for something similar? in particular, i need to make sure the timing of 
the tach. presentation is perfect, as well as the placement of the word in a 
specific part of the visual field. if something has already been designed, 
i'm guessing that it might be of higher quality than were i to write the 
script myself.
thanks,
sarah
