Dear Friends, 

As many of you know, I have recently joined a group of people interested in 
extended interval techniques to the situations when, in addition to guaranteed 
(interval) bounds, we also have some partial information about the probability 
of different values within the corresponding intervals. 

This activivity was pioneered by Ray Moore himself in his 1980s papers, Dan 
Berleant has a website (easily acceissble from the interval webpage) on 
probabilities and intervals. 

For control applications, this activity was done in 1990s by Bob Barmish, the 
author of one of the most well-known books on interval-based (robust) control. 

>From this viewpoint, the following course may be of interest to many 
researchers from our community. 

Many thanks to Greg Coxson for brining this to our attention.

Course on  Randomized Algorithms for Analysis and Control of Uncertain
Systems

Lecturer: Roberto Tempo
          IEIIT-CNR
          Politecnico di Torino, Italy
          tempo@polito.it

Date:   March 14-18, 2005
Place : Dept. Ing. de Sistemas y  Automatica
        Escuela Superior de Ingenieros, Univ. Sevilla, Spain

Summary
This course concentrates on nonstandard tools for control of uncertain
systems with main emphasis on the interplay of probability and
robustness.
The objective is to combine hard bounds, which are frequently used in
classical robust control, with probabilistic information which is often
neglected in this context. The main advantage is to provide additional
insight to the control engineer. This insight may be very useful in
analyzing and designing complex control systems in the presence of
uncertainty. The interplay of probability and robustness also leads to
innovative concepts such as the probabilistic robustness margin and the
probability degradation function. The algorithms obtained are low
complexity (polynomial-time) and are associated to robustness bounds
which are generally less conservative than the classical ones, obviously
at the expense of a small risk expressed in probability. These
algorithms
are usually called "randomized algorithms."

In the first part of the course, we concentrate on analysis and, in
particular, we address the issue of finite sample size. Subsequently, we
present results for sample generation in various norm-bounded sets of
interest in robust control. These results are based on methods of
statistical analysis and of the theory of random matrices. The
construction of specific randomized algorithms concludes this part of
the
course. In the second part, we study probabilistic robust design of
uncertain systems. We show how this problem can be formulated in the
context of classical optimal control and then we discuss how
randomization
and stochastic gradient methods can be successfully used. We also
consider extensions of this approach to linear parameter-varying
systems. Other topics that will be addressed is the design of randomized
algorithms for model predictive control and for robust fault-tolerant
control.

The course will end with a description of a number of open problems
which
may be important to consider in the near future.

The course is focused on the exposition of the theoretical developments
as well as on simulations showing the efficacy of these techniques.

Main list of topics
- Preliminaries and Motivations for a Probabilistic Approach
- Uncertain Systems
- The Interplay of Probability and Robustness
- Randomized Algorithms
- Sample Size Bounds and Statistical Learning Theory

  sampled-data systems, performance of flexible structures)
- Discussion of Open Research Problems

The course is funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and and no
fees will
be charged. The number of places is limited and a first in first served
system
will be used.
