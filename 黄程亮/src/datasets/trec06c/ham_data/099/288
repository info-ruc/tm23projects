Positively yes, I presume...

Certainly, as far as I can judge from the information posted 
to the list, they are certainly working on interval arithmetic.
That is not the problem - the problem is, as I understand 
the post of prof. Moore, that they do not mention/advertise 
that fact (or only very accidentally, as a recent post 
by Jan Chleboun clarifies).
