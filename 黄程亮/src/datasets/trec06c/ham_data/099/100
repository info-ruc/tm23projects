Dear Friends, 

FEM CONFERENCE: IN BRIEF 
In the second week of December 2006, El Paso, Texas will host an
international workshop on Finite Element Methods (FEM) and their
applications to Science and Engineering. 

Several renowned researchers are planning to come, some funding 
has already been secured, and the organizers are actively 
applying for additional support.  

This workshop is organized by an enthusiastic inter-disciplinary team: 
* Pavel Solin (http://www.math.utep.edu/Faculty/solin/) is an
  applied mathematician specializing in higher order finite element
  methods; he is the author of a research monograph Higher-Order Finite
  Element Methods (Chapman & Hall/CRC Press, 2003)
* Jack Chessa (http://www.dmc.utep.edu/chessa) is a professor of
  mechanical engineering department, a specialist in finite
  element methods for non-linear problems such as fracture, 
  shear band and localization phenomena as well as fluid structure
  interaction and multi-phase flow, and, more generally, problems that 
  deal with moving interfaces and discontinuities.

INTERVAL TALKS ARE VERY WELCOME
Both Pavel and Jack have heard a lot of good things about interval 
techniques in FEM as techniques that provide guaranteed error bounds, 
they are very much interested to learn more about these techniques and 
they strongly believe that the interaction between leading FEM
researchers and interval researchers interested in FEM applications
will be very beneficial to both sides.

POTENTIAL COMPLEMENT TO REC WORKSHOPS
This aspect of the planned workshop makes is a nice complement to the
Second International Workshop on Reliable Engineering Computing (REC) 
that Rafi Muhanna and Robert Mullen plan to organize in Savannah, Georgia,
in February 2006 - after the success of their first workshop in
September 2004:

* the REC bring together researchers who use validated
  techniques in engineering (not necessarily in FEM), 
  where we can exchange our ideas and
  techniques and advertise our successes to the larger engineering
  community

* on the other hand, the planned FEM workshop will give us an
  opportunity to make our ideas, techniques, and results more known in
  the general engineering computation community, especially among those
  who use FEM methods. 

PLEASE EXPRESS YOUR INTEREST ASAP
If you are potentially interested in coming, please let Pavel know
ASAP by email to solin@math.utep.edu (copy to me at
vladik@cs.utep.edu). By March 1, 2005, he would like to have a
preliminary list. The more impressive the resulting list, the larger
potential for collaboration and applications, the better chances for
getting additional funding (for some of the grants to support 2006 
conferences, early March 2005 is the deadline). 

By March 1, the workshop dates will be decided exactly. 

INTERVAL TUTORIAL SOLICITED
In view of the collaboration potential, in addition to the research 
interval-related talks of interest to the
FEM community, the organizers would like to include a description of
interval techniques with an emphasis on FEM as a tutorial and/or one
of the keynote talks. They will try their best to fund potential
keynote speakers. 

During several interval-related conferences and at the REC meeting in
Savannah, I have heard many interesting talks and tutorials that, in my 
opinion and in the opinion of other participants, 
are very clear so that they can be rather easily understood by 
the engineering-related audience and very enthusiastic so that they
can enthuse participants into using these verified (reliable)
techniques. 

If you are interested in presenting such a tutorial and/or keynote
talk or if you would like to suggest someone who, in your opinion,
would be the best person for this job, please do not hesitate to email 
Pavel (copy to me) about these possibilities. 

VENUE
The workshop will be held either on campus or 
at the new Hilton hotel that Hilton is
currently building on our campus (it is scheduled to open in February
2006). In any case, a block of rooms will be reserved at the Hilton
hotel for the out-of-town guests. 

The local tradition is that in early December, a Season of Light is
officially opened, with thousands of holiday lights decorating the
trees and the Bhutanese-style buildings on campus. These lights are on 
every evening in December, so you will have an opportunity to enjoy
them.
