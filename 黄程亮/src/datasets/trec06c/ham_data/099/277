OK, but what's a "computer scientist"?  If it means that you've got (at 
least) an undergraduate degree in Computer Science, then you will have 
succeeded in a program that contains A LOT of programming, and A LOT of 
those picky details.

It's necessary, but not sufficient.  As far as I know, there are no 
illiterate literature professors.  I don't think there should be Computer 
Science professors who can't program.

While I agree we should be as creative as possible, we should also avoid 
creating the illusion that computing is a kind and forgiving area of 
endeavor.  Logic is a ferociously difficult medium to work in.  Your code 
will turn around and bite your head off any chance it gets (I've 
experienced this personally, a number of times), and the only way to 
control this is by getting all those picky details right.

I agree that math can be overemphasized.  I don't do this in my 
teaching.  But what I think cannot be overemphasized is the true nature of 
programming.  Unless you're advocating the creation of two separate castes 
of Computer Scientists (the programmers and the non-programmers), a career 
in computing is going to REQUIRE that you master programming with all its 
picky difficulties.  If there were two such castes, I think it's obvious 
which one would have the higher status.

There's a difference (using the automobile as a metaphor) between a DRIVER 
and a MECHANIC.  It sounds like you're training drivers in this 
course.  There's nothing wrong with that per se, but I don't think that 
driving experience necessarily will make your first course as a mechanic 
any easier.
