Dear Ray, Dear participants of the mailing list, 

I seem to be not in my clearest today, my apologies. 

Of course, I did not mean that interval calculators somehow help in balancing a 
checkbook. I apologize for creating this false impression. 

Let me try to state my case clearer. 

Let me describe a scenario how current calculators can cause confusion and how 
interval calculators can help. 

* First, a student balances a checkbook by hand and then again by using a 
calculator. In many such cases, the two results are somewhat different. 

So, the student checks again and again, and find the mistake in what he did by 
hand. 

This happens several times, with different examples.

As a result, the student acquires the following rule: if a calculator produces 
one result and computations by hand produce a different result, then, most 
probably, a calculator is right and calculations by hand are wrong. 

* Now, a student computes the square root of 2 and then squares the resulting 
number. If he or she does it "by hand" (i.e., without using a calculator, in 
this case, by writing expressions on a sheet of paper, by using reasoning), 
this student should get the exact same value 2.

The student is well aware that he sometimes makes mistakes. 

So, to be on the safe side, this students checks his or her result on the 
calculator. The result is not exactly 2, but something like 2.00000001. 

The student already knows, from earlier painful experience, that when the 
calculator and his manual results differ, there is a serious probability that 
the calculator is right. 

(Even when the results of, say, checkbook balancing were differing by 1 cent 
between what the student got by hand and what the student got by using a 
calculator, still the most usual case was a student's mistake, not the 
calculator's mistake.) 

This is where the student is confused: instead of trusting the results of his 
own work, he trusts the calculator instead, and this is a wrong occasion to 
trust the calculator: because with real numbers, calculators are only 
approximate devices. 

* How would an interval calculator help: to check the value 2 that the student 
got by arguing on a sheet of paper, the student runs the same computations on a 
calculator. As a result, the student gets an interval [1.99999999,2.000001] 
that clearly contains his result 2. 

So, instead of being confused (as with the traditional calculator), the student 
is reassured that his or her original sheet-of-paper calculations were correct. 

I hope I made my case clearer now. 

Vladik

P.S. I agree that balancing a checkbook is not the right example for convincing 
the general audience, I am simply trying to explain why I forwarded the 
original email to the interval mailing list in the first place.
