P.S. Same thing in the original example given by Dr. Wilkinson: if instead of 
1.000001, students would see the interval [0.999999,1.00001] that clearly 
contain their own result 1, they would not perceive any discrepancy between 
what they did mentally and what the calculator did. 

On the other hand, with the existing calculator, when they get one result by 
thinking (1) and another result by using a calculator (1.000001), all they see 
is that there are two different results, so they are confused into thinking 
that one of these results is wrong. 

Of course, as Dr. Moore has absolutely correctly stated, the main point of Dr. 
Wilkinson's posting was that the students are unable to think about this 
problem at all. 

What I am saying is that even if they learn to think (but they are not 100% 
sure in themselves), and by thinking, they will come up with a correct result 
1, they will still encounter potential confusion if they get  a different 
number 1.000001 by using a calculator; this confusion will be elimintade (and 
thus, the students' progress improved) if the calculator, instead of providing 
the students with an approximate value with no guartantees of its accuracy, 
would istead provide them with a guiaranteed interval that is guaranteed to 
contain the actual result of the calculations.
