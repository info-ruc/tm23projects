Dear Andrzej, 

Just one comment to what Baker said: united solution set is EXACTLY what 
interval computations is about.

In general, one of the main problems of interval computation is, given a 
function f(x1,...,xn) and intervals [x1],...,[xn], find teh range of f on these 
intervals. 

For linear equations, the inputs are coefficients of the matrix A and of the 
right-hand side b, and i-th function is a function that, given A and b, returns 
i-th component of the solution. Then the range of this function is exactly i-th 
component of the united solution set. 

This is, by the way, how we introduce linear systems in our complexity of 
interval computations book (written with Jiri Rohn). 

Vladik
