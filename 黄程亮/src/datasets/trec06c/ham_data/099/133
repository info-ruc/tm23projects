Hi,
 
The advice you gave me about unmapping buttons doesn't appear to be working. The line reads
 
+11 *<wav 2> "monkey" <aikn +Q>;
 
I get an error message which says "misplaced parameter keyword."
 
Do you know if there's any way around this?

Many thanks
 
Nick Riches

Yes, but the keywords have to be in the body of the item, not before 
it. You've probably got:

+10 "frame" * ; 
+11 "frame" * ;

You need:

+10 "frame" * ;
+11 "frame" * ;

However you can't un-map the abort key name. You'll have to temporarily 
map some other key that has a much lower chance of being accidentally hit 
instead and then map the space bar back again.
