I just noticed that the review of the book
     F. Bornemann et al.,
     The SIAM 100-digit challenge,
     SIAM, Philadelphia 2004
in the MathSciNet
http://www.ams.org/msnmain?fmt=doc&fn=105&id=2076374&l=20&pg3=IID&r=1&s3=254928&v3=Bornemann%2C%20Folkmar
refers to interval arithmetic for verifying the accuracy of the results.

''The authors  second objective in each chapter is to validate the 
correctness of each calculated digit. This objective is achieved through 
various combinations of carefully designed computer experiments, a 
posteriori error estimates and computer-assisted proofs based on 
interval arithmetic.''
