WATCHING ATOMS MOVE
Researchers usually compare "before" and "after" pictures of 
typical regions of a material to see how it changes during a phase 
transition. But now a team has watched a specific set of atoms 
continuously during a surface phase transition to see exactly how 
it occurs, and has made atomic-scale movies. In the 4 February PRL 
they describe their ultrastable scanning-tunneling microscope, or 
STM, that can remain fixed on the same set of surface atoms, even 
as the temperature rises by 100 Kelvin--a huge warming that would 
cause other microscopes to "lose their place." By studying one 
especially pristine region of the surface, the researchers were 
able to learn how the transition occurs, atom-by-atom, in a 
perfectly clean system.
