Howdy Matt,
I'm writing to inquire about whether there will be another CPW welcome
party this year and if you want Putz/East Campus to provide LN2 ice
cream again.  I'm not really sure who to contact about this since Amrys
left the admissions office so if you could let me know who to email, I
would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Rob
