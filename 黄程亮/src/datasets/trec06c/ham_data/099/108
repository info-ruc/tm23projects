Back in 2000, I worked (through my company) with Hewlett-Packard on 
the Xpander calculator project. The calculator, which could have 
introduced some interval concepts to a larger audience (I was 
responsible for the reliable graphing portion), was cancelled---after 
prototypes were built and demonstrated---as upper management at HP 
unexpectedly decided to put nearly all calculator development on 
hold. The large manufacturers have some interest in interval methods 
but want to see demand for such methods from their customers.
