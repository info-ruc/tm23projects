    HOW would it help them ?

    WHY would they "need to know that the result is also not exact" ?

    HOW does this cause confusion ?

    A pocket calculator is perfectly capable, if used correctly, and without 
any intervals,
    of balancing your checkbook correctly; and so you are by hand if you 
take the time.

    That is not necessary for just checkbook calculations. Better examples 
are needed
    to generate "demand" from prospective.customers.
