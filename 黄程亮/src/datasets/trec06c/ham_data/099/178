   Not under Windows XP/2k/NT.  I'm surprised it even lets you, pretty sure 
there's code in there to disallow it.  You can pick other display 
dimensions that might have a different refresh rate or you should be able 
to pick faster refresh rates that might let you come closer but changing 
the number of lines used with another video mode is no longer an 
option.  If you aren't seeing other refresh rates then it's possible you 
need later display drivers, a later operating system or a better video card 
and or a better monitor.
