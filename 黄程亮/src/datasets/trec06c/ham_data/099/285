Here's two questions for the list.

(1) I am using a monitor which I positively know it can work at a refresh 
rate of 120Hz. However, when using TimeDX, the higher refresh rates 
available are 85Hz for several of the video modes. Is that a limitation of 
DMDX? How can I get to faster refresh frequencies?

(2) I am using video (.AVI) files recorded at a 40 ms / frame rate (the 
European standard). If my refresh rate is, say, 11.67. How does the system 
deals with the offset? Will it present the frames for slightly 
longer/shorter time (i.e., 46.7 ms / 35 ms) and then skip a frame from now 
and then to re-synch? Is there any way to know exactly what is happening?

Thank you very much in advance, and sorry if these questions have been 
already asked before. I am currently browsing the message database

bye


Thank you very much
