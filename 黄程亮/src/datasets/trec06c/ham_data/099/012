Dear Friends,

Brenadette Bouchon-Meunier, the main organizer of the conference, will be very 
glad to have an interval session. 

She is a big interval enthusiast, e.g., she the editor-in-chief of the 
International Journal on Uncertainty, Fuzziness, and Knowledge-Based Systems 
(IJUFKS) that regularly publishes abstracts of interval application papers and 
had seevral interval-related special issues. 

If you are interested in participating in this session, please inform me and 
Hung T. Nguyen at vladik@cs.utep.edu and hunguyen@nmsu.edu The deadline is in 
October, so there is still time to decide. 

Your sincerely

Vladik
