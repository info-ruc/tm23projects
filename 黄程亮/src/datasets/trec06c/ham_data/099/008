From: Andreas Griewank <griewank@mathematik.hu-berlin.de>

Dear Colleagues and/or Friends,
   As some of you may know I have moved to the Humboldt University
Berlin, where I hold a professorship on nonlinear optimization
attached to the DFG Reserach Center now named 'Matheon' Together
with Carsten Carstensen, Barbara Niethammer and some other colleagues
from Matheon we have established a 'Graduiertenkolleg', which is a
temoporary graduate school. It provides this year 6 doctoral scholarships
for master level applicants and 6 qualifying scholarships for bachelors.
The focus of the study and research program is

Analysis, Numerics, and Optimization of Multiphase Problems

and we are looking for applicants from mathematics, physics
and engineering with a keen interest and strong background in
applied mathematics. While for the time being I am the coordinator,
optimization is just one aspect and automatic differentiation won't
figure prominently at all. I hope to learn a fair bit about PDEs
myself. For some more details see

 http://multiphase.mathematik.hu-berlin.de

Please encourage suitable students to contact us by e-mail
and send in a resume. Preferably by the end of January, but there
will probably be continuous admission throughout the first year
depending on the quality of applicants. Also next year we'll
get another batch of 6 scholarships and then later hopefully an
extension for a second period of 4.5 years, so that a total of
some 36 doctoral scholarships can be granted. The extra
qualifying scholarships will only be available in the first year.
We hope to attract significant foreign participation and
everything will be conducted in English.

With best wishes and the hope that this year will be more peaceful
than the last, which unfortunately would not take much.

Andreas Griewank
