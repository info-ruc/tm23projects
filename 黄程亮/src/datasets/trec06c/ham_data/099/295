Wayne,

Check out Graphing Calculator at

<www.pacifict.com/>

The good news is that it has a much richer
interface and the algorithms use intervals.

The bad news is that the algorithms are *not*
rigorous.  What would be cool is to have the
interface and versitility of Graphing Calculator
with the rigor of GrafEq.

Perhaps the community could begin to lobby for 
such a development.

Cheers,

Bill
