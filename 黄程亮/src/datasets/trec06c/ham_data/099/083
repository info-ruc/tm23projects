Dear colleagues,

It is my pleasure to bring your attention to the edited monograph

    W. Fellin, H. Lessmann, M. Oberguggenberger, R. Vieider:
    Analyzing Uncertainty in Civil Engineering.
    Springer-Verlag, Berlin 2005.

You can find the table of contents at 
http://www.cs.utep.edu/interval-comp/fellin.pdf

Interval-related papers are in this book in as much as 
random sets and fuzzy sets are employed, and this implies using evaluations 
of functions on intervals. In my review article, intervals as models of 
uncertainty are discussed as well; in addition, there is a paper on 
sensitivity analysis.

Thus the book might be of interest to the interval community.

On behalf of the editors, I thank you for your interest.

With best regards,

Michael Oberguggenberger
