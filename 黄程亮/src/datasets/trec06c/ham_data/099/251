! Practice Items 

=1 *" This"/;
-1 *" information cars";
+1 *" wet must";
+1 *" rabbit be";
-1 *" kept bed";
+1 *" sanitation. secret.";

this is the command line and first practice item for my maze experiment. i find myself confronted with several problems:

1. the first word- "this"- does not get displayed. 

2. i don't really know how to randomize all real items but not the practice items. i first thought that i' d group the practice items together and then have them be the seed for the randomization but then from what i have understood the randomized order would stay the same for all items which is unwanted.

thank you for your help,

tanya dolis
