Dear interval researchers,

I have general question related to the problem,
what is interval arithmetic and what is not interval arithmetic.

As far as I know interval arithmetic
is based on the functions with interval parameters in the following form:

z=f(x)         e.g. [-1, 1] = sin([-10, 10])

or

z=f(x,y)
e.g.
[2,5]=+([1,2],[1,3]) or [2,5]=[1,2]+[1,3]

[1,6]=*([1,2],[1,3]) or [1,6]=[1,2]*[1,3]

i.e. f=+,-,*,/.

However, according to my knowledge
in most of the books which are related to interval arithmetic
there are information about systems of linear interval equations.
In this case relation between input and output interval parameters is much
more complicated.

Y=hull{{x: Ax=B, A belong to [A], B belong to [B]}

We have also united solution set, tolerable solution set,
controllable solution set etc.

My question is.

****************************************************************************
Does theory of systems of linear interval equations belong
to interval arithmetic or not?
****************************************************************************

If more complicated relations on intervals
(e.g. system of linear interval equations) also belong
to interval arithmetic
then maybe all functions on intervals are some extensions
of interval arithmetic.

I suspect that the authors of the presented book
(i.e. Uncertain Input Data Problems and the Worst Scenario Method)
work on some functions with intervals or set valued parameters
(I am not sure, I do not know that book).
Then from that point of view
they are working on some extension of interval arithmetic.

Regards,

Andrzej Pownuk

I agree.

I have ordered it from Amazon.  Perhaps the authors don't know
about intervals.  Many people still do not.

The encouraging thing is that even point people are starting
to realize the importance of input uncertainty.  This can only
be good for us. :)

Cheers,

Bill

P.S. If nothing else, this is a source of good examples for
you to use in your talk. :)
