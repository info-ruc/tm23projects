Andy, 

I have tried to replace <mnr +Space> with <mnr +SpaceBar> and got the
following error message
"Button name <+SpaceBar> not found on input devices". Apparently, the name
of space bar on the laptop is "Space".
When I use <mnr +Space> DMDX doesn't complain and executes the code.
However, when I press the space bar I get "No Response" message, indicating
that the DMDX doesn't register pressing the space bar due to some reason. I
assume that space bar has a special function in DMDX and doesn't get mapped
easily, if at all. 

If there are no other suggestions I will try to use your code as a last
resort. 

Thank you, 
Arman

Dear Arman,  try changing your <mnr +Space> bit to <mnr +SpaceBar> .  I find
it odd though that your space bar is called SpaceBar, something to do with
the external keyboard?  Also, here's some incredibly ugly (and probably
incredibly inefficient) code I put together a while back that allowed me to
remap responses to the buttons of a mouse. I bet there are much nicer
examples on the DMDX list archive though. Best, Andy.

Subject: [DMDX] Trouble mapping Spacebar for a response

Greetings !

I was trying to map a SpaceBar on computer keyboard for a response. However,
it doesn't work. I could successfully map few other buttons (e.g. Left and
Right Arrows, Backspace), but not the SpaceBar (I got the SpaceBar button
name from TimeDX).
I am using Acer TravelMate 8000 laptop with an external keyboard. I have
tried to disconnect the external keyboard, but it didn't help either. 
Any ideas what could be a possible cause? 

Thank you for your help, 
Arman


Here is an example of a code I am using:
----
<ep> <s 1> <cr> <t 4000> <id keyboard> <dbc 255255255> <vm
640,480,480,32,60> <eop>

$
! HERE IS THE MAPPING PART;
! Here BackSpace works, but Space doesn't
1 <umpr> <umnr> <mpr +Backspace> <mnr +Space>;
$
\
+111 "Get ready !" <ms% 500> //  * <wav> "111.wav";
