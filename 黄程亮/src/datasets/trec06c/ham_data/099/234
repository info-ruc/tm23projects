Several people have posted that you have to really 'love' programming and
you have to be able to handle the 'picky details' to be in computing. 
This is true if you want to be a professional programmer.  It isn't
necessarily true if you want a carrer in computing.  Many computer
scientist don't program.  This is somewhat like saying you have to love to
read to be a literature professor.  Certainly you need to know how to read
but that isn't the most important thing.

Also my point about many girls not wanting to 'eat', 'sleep' and 'breathe'
computers doesn't mean that they can't be great computing professionals. 
This is more saying that girls and women want a balance in their lives. 
They don't want to be the stereotype of a hacker who never bathes and
stays up all night writing code and has no life.  This doesn't mean that
they don't enjoy programming, it just isn't what they want to do every
waking hour.  We need to let girls and women know that they don't have to
match that sterotype to be interested in computing and to make a carrer
out of it. Yes, there are people who match that sterotype but there are
many more who don't.

One of the things that surprises comp sci majors is how creative computing
is once they get past the early courses.  We need to show that it can be
creative before people lose interest in it.

Yes, there is a certain amount of picky detail in programming.  But, we
can create assignments that allow for creativity and don't just focus on
the picky details.  Computing can and should be fun.  Computers let us
create all sorts of things.

One of the things that turns people off of computing courses is an
overemphasis on math.  Yes, computing uses math, but it doesn't have to be
the main focus of the course.  Just how interesting is coverting
temperatures or calculating sales tax?  To most students this is very
boring stuff.  At Georgia Tech we are using media manipulation to teach an
intro course and many students (especially women) are finding it more
interesting than the usual assignments. It also allows people to do
creative assignments with their own pictures and sounds.

I know many of the AP teachers are math teachers and you love math.  Just
realize that a great many people don't love math.  So if we want to
attract
more people to CS let's try to create interesting, creative, AP courses.
