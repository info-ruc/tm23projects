Barb Ericson makes an eloquent plea for non-picky programming.

One of the things that turns people off of computing courses is an
overemphasis on math.  Yes, computing uses math, but it doesn't have to be
the main focus of the course.  Just how interesting is coverting
temperatures or calculating sales tax?  To most students this is very
boring stuff.  At Georgia Tech we are using media manipulation to teach an
intro course and many students (especially women) are finding it more
interesting than the usual assignments. It also allows people to do
creative assignments with their own pictures and sounds.

It always amazes me that one NEVER sees a college professor make a plea
that a course should reduce its reading or writing but it is OK to
deemphasize the single greatest tool ever invented to communicate
quantitative ideas (math).  Why is that?? I do not understand??

In the same paragraph above one sees the phrase  "media manipulation"
which in my limited understanding of English means almost nothing. One
meaning could be manipulation of graphics objects on the screen.  If this
is the case, there is a tremendous amount of math going on under the skin.
Do the kids learn how to do the manipulations without ever learning HOW
they are actually accomplished?

BTW:  I am doing this form of "media manipulation" in my AP class right now
as a sneaky way to make inheritance and polymorphism a tiny bit clearer (I
hope).
BTW2:  They have a starter toolbox that includes scaling and rotation and
Orbiting that all use math I assume they will learn other places so I guess
I am agreeing with Barb that sometimes it is good to deemphsize the math
for other points.  The kids seem perfectly happy to use the toolbox as a
"black box".
BTW3:  I am conflicted - I personnally hate to use tools (especially
computer tools) that I don't have a clear understanding of their internals
BUT I do it all the time.  I don't really have a clue how the clever folks
at MS handle the windowing of a word document and I TAUGHT one of the lead
programmers on that project (he worked from late 80's into the mid-late
90's when he retired!!)
