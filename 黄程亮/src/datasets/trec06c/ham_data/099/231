Sara,

I don't know of any existing script, but the following should do what you
want.

--k.i.f.

<fd 36>  <vm 1024,768,768,8,0> <d 0> <cr> <nfb>
0 "Instructions";
0 "Press the spacebar to continue.";
=1 *"The boy went behind the desk";
=2 *"and found an old typewriter,";
=3 *"which he dropped out of the window";
=4 *"which was on the seventh floor.";
+5 %20 / %3 *"          CRASH"/ ;	
! This is a left field - right-field contrast;
0 "Press the spacebar to continue.";
! The left field version would look like this";
+5 %20 / %3 *"CRASH          "/ ;
0 "Press the spacebar to continue.";
! If you want fancier positioning, then you need
to use the x-y co-ordinates.  For example--";
+5 %20 / %3 *  <xy 0.25, 0.25>"CRASH"/ ;
0 "Press the spacebar to continue.";
+5 %20 / %3 *  <xy 0.75, 0.75> "CRASH"/ ;
! See the help file for details.;
	
		
0 "That's the end. Thank you!";
