All,

If the criterion to "belonging" to interval arithmetic is whether
or not interval researchers work on it, then the result is a
resounding "yes."  Ask Jiri Rohn, G{\"o}tz Alefeld, or Sergey Shary,
(among others) for example.  

I view "interval arithmetic" as striving to compute sharp bounds
on ranges, in a way that takes account of machine arithmetic.  This
may, at times, go beyond use of the pre-programmed four basic
"arithmetic" operations;  I think the goal should take us wherever
is appropriate, and we should not get too stuck on what the subject
is called, except, of course, if it would otherwise lead
to technical confusion, or for promotional purposes :-)

Best regards,

Baker
