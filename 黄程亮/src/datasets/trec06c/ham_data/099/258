I agree.

I have ordered it from Amazon.  Perhaps the authors don't know
about intervals.  Many people still do not.

The encouraging thing is that even point people are starting 
to realize the importance of input uncertainty.  This can only
be good for us. :)

Cheers,

Bill

P.S. If nothing else, this is a source of good examples for
you to use in your talk. :)
