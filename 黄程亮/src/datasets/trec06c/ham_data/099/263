Dear Friends, 

I have just learned that the deadline for submitting papers to  Annual 
Conference of North American Information Processing Society NAFIPS'05, Ann 
Arbor, Michigan, June 22-25, 2005, has been extended to February 28, 2005.

Because of the close connection between interval and fuzzy methods, this 
conference is always very much interested in interval-related talks. 

Just in case, the conference URL is http://www.nafips05.wayne.edu
