   Turns out we don't have an Inspiron 6000 upstairs but instead have a 
1000 or 1100 instead.  Still has an Intel graphics chip in it though and 
the more I think about it the less trouble I ever recall DMDX having with 
the Intel devices.  In fact they're almost my recommended thing these days, 
Intel aren't obsessed like Nvidia and ATI with absurdly good 3D bench marks 
so their drivers are solid and every time I can think of recently that DMDX 
has run on one of their chipsets it's been without any shenanigans at all.

   There's nothing wrong with being a self-made man if you don't
consider the job finished too soon.
