Dear Ray, 

I agree with you 100%.

There may be a mention of intervals inside, but it is unusul that these 
techniques are not mentioned in the general description - while the topic seems 
to be taylor-made for the interval techniques.

That is why I forwarded this information to the interval mailing list: that 
this is an overview of the problems where interval will probably help and are 
not under-used.

As you may remember from some of my previous email, I am currently starting to 
work together with Dr. Pavel Solin, one of the former co-workers of Dr. Babuska 
(he invited Babuska to El Paso last year). From my experience of working with 
Dr. Solin, he is enthusaistic about all possible techniques, he is just not 
that familiar with interval techniques and their capabilities. I think this is 
one more opportunity for us to teach our techniques to a new set of folks, and 
by collaborating with them convince them that interval techniques should 
definitely be a part of their toolbox. 

In my experience of working with engineers and applied mathematicians, 
sometimes the problem is that they do not appreciate th eneed for validated 
guaranteed worts-case estimates. 

This book is an example of an area where the problem is well-understood and 
since this problem is exactly what our interval techniques are good at solving, 
there is a great potential of using these techniques. 

This is one of the reasons why I am so enthusiastic about this book and 
potential for usese of interval techniques.
