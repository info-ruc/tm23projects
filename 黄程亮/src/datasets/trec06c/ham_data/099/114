Dear Dr. Williamson, 

I agree (and have always agreed) with your main point: that if people cannot 
think and cannot do the computations by hand, then they should learn how to do 
it. I am NOT arguing against it. I am all for it. It was never my intent to 
argue that students should not learn how to think or that they should not learn 
how to add by hand. They should, you are absolutely right. 

What I am making is another claim. 

But what I am doing is making one step forward. 

Let us consider the students who have learned how to think and how to do 
computations in their heads (and there are such students). For such students, I 
argue that interval calculator will be less confsuing than the existing one. 

This is what my argument was about. 

I hope that this (fifth?) time I have made my argument clearer. 

Vladik
