I have worked in the non-programming side of CS for 15 years before
becomming a teacher.

Picky Details are at the HEART of Computer Science.  Mess up a "picky
detail" and you could be looking for a new job.

Fine, girls don't want to be hackers... but why are you ASSUMING that
every example every one uses is a "geek" example?  My intro into classes
and objects was a cake baking company.

I take exception to your messages, because they ASSUME that no one is
doing anything, or very little, to attract women to CS.  Why don't you
send a letter to MTV, Jessica Simpson is doing more to damage careers in
CS for women than Bill Gates is.
