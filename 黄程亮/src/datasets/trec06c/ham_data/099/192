Dear Cultural Club,

   SIU has some great events planed for this semester. It would be
great if your club would like to get involved!

-SIU Board


1.  We are very pleased to announce that for the first time ever,
SIU will be extending a warm welcome to the international students
in the new incoming class by way of snail mail!  We have been
granted permission by the Office of International Admissions to
send our own, separate information packet to these students.
   Among the contents of the mailing we will include a pamphlet
about international campus life, with information about other
cultural groups,and the cultural events of 2004-2005.  If you would
like your club to be on this list, please send to siu@columbia.edu:
     1. the name of your club
     2. a brief description of what you do
     3. the highlights of your events 2004-2005
     4. a contact email address

   We would also appreciate it if you could encourage your members
to help us with the handwritten postcards, input for our "What I
wish I knew when packing for Columbia" tip sheet, and any other
suggestions and help they can give us!




2. SIU World Cup Event

Our SIU World Cup tournament will be held at the beginning of April,
either in the South Lawn or in one of the gyms. Our 1- to 2-day
tournament will also feature a grand prize!

We are looking for cultural clubs to enter teams into the
tournament. If you can't find enough people to form a national
team, you may get permission from us to form a regional team (such
as West African team or Southeast Asian team). All team lists will
have to be turned in by March 19. The entry fee for each team is $5
and goes towards the grand prize!

Sign up or send questions to Veli Yasin at vny1@columbia.edu.
