Re need to teach kids (and adults) about accuracy and maybe intervals. And 
maybe in favbor of interval calculators.

I spent a long time teaching
mathematics 
...

I have found that if you take the calculator away from the student,
they cannot add, subtract, multiply, or divide, let alone doing fractions.

An example that I have had arguments with students over is (2/3)^4 *
(3/2)^4. The answer we all know is 1, but they argue their calculator says
the answer is not one, but something, depending upon the calculator brand,
like 1.00000001.

...

 From my observations, it appears as if all they know how to do is punch
buttons when they get out of high school when calculators are used in the
classroom.
