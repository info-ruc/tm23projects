All,

Yes, I see "sloppy thinking" frequently on students' papers in 
upper division undergraduate courses.  For example, when a 
student is exhibiting a computation of the form

(3+2) * 5 + 4, 

I might see the following on the paper:

"5 = 25 = 29"

I suspect this is at least partially a consequence of repeatedly
pushing a button on a calculator that, although labelled "=" actually
has the functionality of "accumulate partial result".  

In my undergraduate numerical analysis course (as many on this
list probably also teach), we teach roundoff error in introductory
sessions.  I assigned some problems
from a text in which students were to do some floating point computations
on a moderately sensitive polynomial, using a 3-digit "toy" system
and first rounding, then chopping.  Carefully reading the students'
papers, about 70% missed it.  Several came up to me beforehand, totally
befuddled.  I saw liberal use of the "=" symbol, both as in my 
example above and as a substitute for "approximately equal."  In 
30 years of teaching this course, my impression is that this is 
the worst I have seen it.  (However, several students DID get it.
In fact, one did the assignment by producing an object-oriented
class in Matlab that did decimal arithmetic to a prescribed number
of places and with a prescribed rounding mode.  However, amazingly,
that student is apparently weak with other mathematical concepts.)

Best regards,

Baker
