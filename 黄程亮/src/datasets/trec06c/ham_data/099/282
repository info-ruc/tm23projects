Hello.  I've been playing with Jeff Tupper's wonderful GrafEq program
(http://www.peda.com/grafeq), but I would like to be able to solve
problems in more than two variables.  Some searching around finds
a program called UniCalc,

	http://archives.math.utk.edu/software/msdos/miscellaneous/unicalc/.html

although it's a little archaic (from about 1995, only working under
MS-DOS).  Is there anything a bit more modern that combines the
versatility of UniCalc with a more modern interface, and presumably
updated algorithms, such as those found in GrafEq?
