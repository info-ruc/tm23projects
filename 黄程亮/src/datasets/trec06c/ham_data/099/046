   It currently only supports Measurement Computing and Keithley interface 
cards.  Any other types of cards will require someone sponsoring their 
addition to DMDX   unless there are DirectX drivers for the cards (unlikely 
as we've yet to see any instances of DirectX drivers for interface cards).

   Expertise in one field does not carry over into other fields.
But experts often think so.
