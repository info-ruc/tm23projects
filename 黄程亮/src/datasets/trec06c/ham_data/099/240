Discussions of this topic remind me of the article by Ellen
Spertus back in 1991, entitled, "Why are There so Few Female
Computer Scientists?"  If I am not mistaken, this was
mandatory reading for MIT faculty.  Here's the link:

If any of you out there have other articles on gender and
computing, please drop me an email.  

I do not, for one second, buy the argument that one must live
and breathe computing to be good at it.  I know too many
people whose lives defy the assertion.  Rather, I worry very
much, based on the literature of which I am aware, that such
an attitude may well discourage girls--and some boys, for that
matter--from participating in computing fields.

Just my opinion.
