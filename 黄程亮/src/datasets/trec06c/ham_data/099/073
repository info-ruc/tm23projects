Thanks for that. I'll give it a try.

Yes, but the keywords have to be in the body of the item, not before 
it. You've probably got:

+10 "frame" * ; 
+11 "frame" * ;

You need:

+10 "frame" * ;
+11 "frame" * ;

However you can't un-map the abort key name. You'll have to temporarily 
map some other key that has a much lower chance of being accidentally hit 
instead and then map the space bar back again.
