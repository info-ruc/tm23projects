Hi,

I'd like to run a masked priming experiment in which the prime duration is 
33 ms. But I'm using DMDX on a (Win 2000) setup which has a refresh rate of 
13.33 ms, so the closest I can get is either 27 ms or 40 ms. On DMASTR it 
used to be possible to change the number of screen lines in order to reduce 
the refresh rate. TimeDX has an option to modify the number of screen 
lines, but it seems to make the program crash (even if I change the number 
by one unit). Is there some way that I can either reduce or increase the 
refresh rate?

Thanks,
Colin
