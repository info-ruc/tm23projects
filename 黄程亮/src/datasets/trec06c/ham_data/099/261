Hi,

Thanks for replies to my previous message about choosing different refresh 
rates -- I've now discovered that a new video card was required (we got a 
Sapphire Radeon 7000). My next question concerns the Enh. Retrace test in 
TimeDX. As I understand it, this is the gold standard: if the screen is 
split into two (stationary) equal halves, then the estimated refresh rate 
is correct (even if there are some timed out traces). The two halves should 
be red and blue. However, on some computers (using 8 bit color depth), I 
find that the two halves are red and black. Does this matter?

Thanks,
Colin
