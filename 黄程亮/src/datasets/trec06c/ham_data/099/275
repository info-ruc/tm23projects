I believe that the single issue that most causes women to drop out
of computer science classes is their perception that computer
scientists spend all their time in front of a computer screen
and in semi-isolation.  If we could convince women early in their
academic careers that some computer scientists really do work
with people, I think we would retain more of them.  Unfortunately,
our courses are rarely structured for anything other than many
long hours alone with a pc.

Another problem can be teachers who (1) expect that students
should not be interested in anything other than computers
and (2) focus on "shoot-em-up" projects and/or inappropriate
ways of presenting concepts.
