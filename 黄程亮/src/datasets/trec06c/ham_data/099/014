POSTDOC POSITION IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
ECOLE NORMALE SUPERIEURE, LYON FRANCE

   SOFTWARE COMPONENTS FOR VALIDATED SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING

Other postdoc offers (cryptology, interval arithmetic) are
available and can be consulted at
http:// www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/Arenaire/


Projet Arenaire / Laboratoire LIP (CNRS - ENSL - INRIA - UCBL)
Ecole Normale Superieure
46 Allee d'Italie
69364 Lyon Cedex 07
France


SUPERVISORS: Nathalie Revol (LIP-INRIA) (Nathalie.Revol@ens-lyon.fr),
Gilles Villard (LIP-CNRS) (Gilles.Villard@ens-lyon.fr).

RESEARCH PROJECT
The candidate will be hosted by the Arenaire team of the LIP
Laboratory.

The goal is to contribute to the Roxane collaborative project:
Reliable Open Software-Components for Algebraic and Numeric
Efficiency (cf. Bernard.Mourrain@inria.fr ---
http://www-sop.inria.fr/galaad/logiciels/roxane).
Roxane mutualizes and organizes the efforts of implementation that
are done in different research groups in: computer arithmetic,
computer algebra and numerical computing.

In this context, the domain of expertise of Arnaire covers
- arbitrary precision interval arithmetic and dedicated numerical
  algorithms, which lead to certified numerical results while still
  using floating-point arithmetic;
- exact arithmetic especially for finite fields, rational numbers
  or polynomials.

The candidate will work on these topics, including both algorithm
design and software realizations.  The algorithm side may concern
linear algebra, lattice basis reduction, numerical constraint
programming or optimization.  Software aspects will include
developments on Roxane, as well as works based on existing components,
and the extension of their interoperability.


SKILLS
Candidates should have skills in computer arithmetic, and in one of
the algorithmic domains mentioned in the research project.
The programming language will be C or C++.


PREFERRED DURATION: One year.


TO APPLY: please contact ASAP
Nathalie Revol (Nathalie.Revol@ens-lyon.fr)
