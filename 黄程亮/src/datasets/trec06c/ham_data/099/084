Call for Papers
19th International Symposium on Distributed Computing
DISC 2005
Krakow, Poland, September 25-29, 2005.

IMPORTANT DATES
# Submission Deadline: May 8, 2005, 12PM (EST, UTC-5hours)
# Acceptance Notification: July 5, 2005
# Camera ready copy due: July 28, 2005

DISC, the International Symposium on DIStributed Computing, is an annual
forum for research presentations on all facets of distributed computing.
DISC 2005 is organized in cooperation with the European Association for
Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS).

SCOPE

Original contributions to the theory, design, analysis, implementation,
or application of distributed systems and networks are solicited.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
# distributed algorithms and their complexity
# fault-tolerance of distributed systems
# multiprocessor/cluster architectures and algorithms
# distributed operating systems
# distributed computing issues on
   - the Internet
   - the Web
   - small worlds
# distributed systems management
# distributed applications such as:
   - peer-to-peer networks
   - databases
   - mobile agents
# communication network architectures and protocols
# distributed programing languages
# specification, semantics, and verification of distributed systems
# cryptographic and security protocols for distributed systems
# consistency conditions and synchronization

REGULAR PAPERS AND BRIEF ANNOUNCEMENTS

Regular papers must present original work not previously published,
and not concurrently submitted elsewhere for publication (conference
or journal).

Ongoing work for which full papers are not ready yet or recent results
published elsewhere are suitable for submission as brief
announcements.  It is hoped that researchers will use the brief
announcement track to quickly draw the attention of the community to
their experiences, insights and results from ongoing distributed
computing research and projects.

PUBLICATION AND PRESENTATION

The symposium program lists all accepted papers--regular and brief
announcements. Brief Announcements get 5 to 10 minutes each, and 2
pages in the proceedings.  Regular Papers get 25 minutes each, and 15
pages in the proceedings. The symposium proceedings will include
accepted Regular Papers and Brief Announcements, and will be published
by Springer in its Lecture Notes in Computer Science series.

Extended and revised versions of selected papers will be considered
for a special issue of the ACM - Springer Verlag journal: Distributed
Computing.

SUBMISSION FORMAT

Every submission, regular or brief, should be in English, begin with a
cover page (not a cover letter), and be followed by an extended
abstract. The cover page must include:
# title,
# the names of all authors and their affiliations,
# contact author's postal address, email address, and telephone number,
# a brief, one paragraph abstract of the paper,
# whether the paper is to be considered for the regular track, the brief
announcement track, or both, and
# whether the submission should be considered for the best student paper
award.

A regular submission's extended abstract should be no longer than 4500
words and not exceed 10 pages using at least 11 point font and
reasonable margins. (The page limit includes all figures, tables,
graphs, and references.) Additional necessary details may be included
in a clearly marked appendix that will be read at the discretion of
the program committee. Alternatively, the submissions can be formatted
according to the LNCS style, in which case the regular submissions
should be no longer than 15 pages.

A brief announcement's extended abstract should not exceed 2 pages
using at least 11 point font and reasonable margins.

Submissions deviating from these guidelines will be rejected without
consideration of their merits.

It is recommended that the extended abstracts begin with a succinct
statement of the problem or the issue being addressed, a summary of the
main results or conclusions, a brief explanation of their significance,
a brief statement of the key ideas, and a comparison with related work,
all tailored to a non-specialist. Technical development of the work,
directed to the specialist, should follow.

SUBMISSION

Authors are strongly encouraged to submit their papers electronically.
Information about how to submit papers will be available on
http://www.disc-conference.org/. Authors who cannot submit
electronically must submit 15 printed copies of their paper to the
DISC program chair at the following address:

   Pierre Fraigniaud,
   LRI, bat 490
   Universite Paris Sud,
   91405 Orsay cedex,
   France
   Email: Pierre.Fraigniaud@lri.fr
   Phone:+33 169 156 906

Authors submitting hard copies should also send an e-mail to the
program chair indicating that they are submitting in this manner.

BEST STUDENT PAPER AWARD

A paper is eligible for the best student paper award only if it is a
regular submission, one of its authors is a full-time student at the
time of submission and the student's contribution is significant. The
program committee may split this award or decline to make it.
