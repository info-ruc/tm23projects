Aaron,

Thank you for the quick response to my questions, I do appreciate it.  I am, in fact, registered with the mailing list, though I have not received any messages before this one.  I had re-registered this morning, just in case.

Following is the information from the output of Mauve which I mentioned in my earlier message.  This is utilizing the older version of Mauve.  The reason I am confused is because I can run the newer version with no problems, but get this message with the old version. I've had this happen on several machines.  I am uncertain if there is a conflict or not with having both versions installed at the same time.  At any rate, here is the information.  Thank you again for your help.

William
