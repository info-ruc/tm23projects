                        POSTDOCTORAL POSITION
             in COMPUTER SCIENCE and INTERVAL MATHEMATICS
          University of Nantes, LINA laboratory, CoCoA Team
                               -----

The CoCoA (Continuous Constraints and Applications) team of the LINA (Computer
Science Laboratory of Nantes Atlantique) laboratory invites applications for a
postdoctoral position.

The appointment will be for one year, starting between September 2005 and
December 2005. The CoCoA team will support candidates into applying to
fellowships and grants programs. For this purpose, interested candidates should
send their application the sooner.

Context
-------
The CoCoA team consists of 15 researchers who aim at solving general first-order
formulas over integers and reals, involving non-linear constraints, uncertainty,
preferences on the data and efficiency criteria. The base tools we use are
interval analysis, constraint propagation (CP), symbolic computation and
tree-search methods.

Constraint programming provides a declarative and natural way of formulating
problems as constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) by stating the requirements
(constraints) that must be fulfilled by the solutions. The CoCoA team is
especially interested in numerical CSPs which involve constraints over real
numbers. Such CSPs appear in industrial applications like conceptual design,
computer aided design, robotics and molecular biology, which are the main
applications the CoCoA team is tackling.

Objectives
----------
The postdoctoral fellow will be involved into one of the ongoing research
projects of the team, contribute to the development of the ELISA platform for
constraint programming and optimization, and pursue researches in one of the
following directions (depending on her/his abilities and desires):
  * hybridization of solving/optimization techniques (local/global,
    numeric/symbolic, ...)
  * design of solving/optimization methods for composite problems
    (hierarchical conjunctive/disjunctive models, mixed problems)
  * definition of systems and languages for constraint programming and
    optimization
  * study of a given application field (design, bioinformatics, ...)

Candidate profile
-----------------
Interested candidates should send an application letter including detailed CV
(with a list of publications and a description of research interests) to the
contacts below. The candidate must hold a recent PhD (within 5 years) at the
appointment time.

Applicants must have sound publications and expertise in one or more of the
following areas (in a broad sense):
  * Programming languages and constraint programming
  * Optimization techniques (interval, convex, local, global, ...)
  * Cooperative problem solving

Environment
------------
The city of Nantes is ideally located, only two hours from Paris by TGV
(high-speed train, 20 shuttles per day) and about two hours by plane from most
European capitals. Gateway to the Brittany ports, just a step away from major
tourist sites such as Mont Saint-Michel, the Puy du Fou, the Futuroscope or the
"Chateaux de la Loire", Nantes is also only 50km away from the renown coasts of
Brittany and beaches of Vendee.

The LINA laboratory offers a friendly working environment and excellent
computational facilities.
