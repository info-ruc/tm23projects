Dear Ray, 

>From your reply, I realize that I did not make my point right. 

I agree with what you said, the need to teach mental arithmetic was the main 
point (and a valid point) of the posting, a point that I did not emphasize 
because it is of general interest, not specific to our interval area. 

What I wanted to say that is that on top of this point, adding uncertainty to 
calculators - whether in explanations in the class or explicitly in hardware -- 
would further help students. 

In the example given by Dr. Wilkinson, yes, mental arithmetic would help, but 
if they try square root of 2 then they need to know that the result is also not 
exact. 

>From the viewpoint of a kid, a weight measured by a scale is more accurate that 
a weight guessed by a human being; a velocity measured by a radar is more 
accurate than estimated visually. A natural kid's conclusion is that whatever 
calcuator produces shouldbe more accurate than what we do by hand. This is one 
of the sources of confusion. 

Honestly, when I balance by checkbook by hand, I trust myself less (and make 
mistakes more often) then if I use the corresponding software. 

Calculator is capable of correct (guaranteed) computations, but we need to 
program and modify it accordingly, or at least explain.

I think the need felt by educators may be a good opportunity for us to educate 
people more in uncertainty issues.
