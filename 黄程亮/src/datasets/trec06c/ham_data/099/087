campus preview weekend is april 7 - 10 thusday - sunday.

this is when admitted students get to check out MIT and it's an
opportunity for us to freak them out, I mean, welcome them.

it is comparable to a mini-rush

we get to have events such as the annual miss ugly contest, a baking
contest, and the cryo fac.  some other things I thought would be awesome
would be a 5 hour dance party, half an hour on each hall. a giant hammock
spanning the two parallels would also be a nice touch.

if you have ideas and/or want to get involved in any way  there will be a
meeting next Monday at 11 pm in
Talbot.

also, I am still looking for a co-cpw-chair.  it'll be fuuunn.  reply soon
before I just appoint someone.

w0rd,
yang
