Many of my students have expressed interest in media, such as game 
design, computer animation, 3D modeling, special effects.  I know very 
little about these fields -- my real-world experience is in server-side 
web programming.  But, I start my course with chapter 1 of Objects First 
(the shapes project to get used to the environment of BlueJ), then 
Chapter 1 of Java Au Naturel (Turtle graphics, to get used to creating 
and using objects, and introducing while loops and methods). They get 
excited by seeing pictures on the screen -- being able to animate a 
circle, or draw a house or a spiral. In fact, with the spiral, which 
involves just a while loop and a counter variable, they get to see 
changes in the picture as they play with the numbers. It makes numbers 
more concrete while giving them something "cool" to print out.

Plus, when I started doing System.out.println and using EasyReader, one 
of the first questions I got was "can I make it say anything I want" and 
I said, yes, keep it G-rated, and edit the language before you turn it 
in.  :)  There is a fascination with being able to have control of the 
computer.

My class is a wide mix of ability, as our program is still new, we're on 
block schedule, and I can't be picky about pre-reqs.

My problem now, is that I'm into the more abstract details of 
parameters, data types, local variables, instance variables, and tons of 
new terminology (right now we're working on a guess-the-number game 
class involving boolean methods, and boolean expressions in if 
statements). I'm losing them a bit in the details. I'm still trying to 
figure out how to balance the presentation of new concepts with 
interesting practice at the computer. I'm going to try JOptionPane and 
JTextArea as a substitute for System.out.println, and see what happens...
