It seems odd to me that there is no mention of interval computation in the 
book.

> This book deals with the impact of uncertainty in input data on the
> outputs of mathematical models. Uncertain inputs as scalars, tensors,
> functions, or domain boundaries are considered. In practical terms,
> material parameters or constitutive laws, for instance, are uncertain, and
> quantities as local temperature, local mechanical stress, or local
> displacement are monitored. The goal of the worst scenario method is to
> extremize the quantity over the set of uncertain input data.
>
> A general mathematical scheme of the worst scenario method, including
> approximation by finite element methods, is presented, and then applied to
> various state problems modeled by differential equations or variational
> inequalities: nonlinear heat flow, Timoshenko beam vibration and buckling,
> plate buckling, contact problems in elasticity and thermoelasticity with
> and without friction, and various models of plastic deformation, to list
> some of the topics. Dozens of examples, figures, and tables are included.
