Dear Deans and Advisors:

On behalf of WSE and DCCEAS, we want to thank all of you and your 
associates and assistants again for your efforts LAST YEAR (2004) in 
getting a total of 11 students from 4 of the local engineering schools 
to enter papers the 2004 competition, about twice as many as in 2003. 
All the entrants were congratulated and were all seen as winners, 
although only six were actually recognized with awards at the banquet on 
Feb 28, 2004.

THIS YEAR (2005), we received a total of only two papers. Fortunately, 
the papers were of such high quality that two separate panels of Judges 
voted unanimously for the papers to receive first place awards in their 
respective categories, as indicated in the results shown below.

We would appreciate your comments on how to improve the competition and 
overall participation, and would be glad to meet with you and your 
faculty and students at your convenience. 

We also want to thank the WSE and DCCEAS Officials and Judges listed 
below for their invaluable assistance.

Happy Black History Month and
Happy Engineers Week Greetings from:

Bob Efimba, P.E.
WSE Past President and Chair of the Education Committee
DCCEAS Past President and Chair of the Education Committee
