   DMDX just exposes what the video drivers decide are the available video 
modes.  Be aware that just because a monitor can go at 120Hz in one video 
mode doesn't mean it can go at 120Hz in all video modes.  Monitors also 
have limitations on the horizontal frequency and that limits the higher 
video modes more than vertical frequency does.  Your video card can also be 
a limitation.

   You would have to talk to the makers of the video codec that is 
rendering your .AVI file.  Basically it drops frames and all resorts to 
sorts of chicanery to get a good output.

   There's nothing wrong with being a self-made man if you don't
consider the job finished too soon.
