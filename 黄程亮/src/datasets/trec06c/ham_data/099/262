Correction about monotonicity: 

If the function is monotonic in each of the variables, you do not need 2^n 
computations, only n+3 to find the range: first, you modify the 1st variable to 
see if the function if the function is increasing or decreasing over x1; then 
you change the 2nd variable only to see whether it is increasing or decreasing 
over x2, etc. 

After n such calls to f, you know where exactly f attains its maximum and where 
it attains its minimum, so you need 2 calls to f to find both upper endpoint 
and lower endpoint of the range.
