All well and good, but learning to program is difficult.  Programming is 
quite different from anything else people encounter, which makes the 
learning curve extremely challenging.  You have to REALLY want to learn 
this stuff.

>Too much focus on picky details.

Compilers and operating systems can be annoying that way.  It comes with 
the territory.  You have to be the kind of person who experiences the need 
to get EVERY SINGLE DETAIL PERFECTLY CORRECT as an interesting (or perhaps 
that should be "addicting") challenge.  It helps to be somewhat obsessive 
(he said, self-referentially).

This goes back to commitment and fascination.  Programming, due to its 
intrinsic difficulty, REQUIRES a high level of commitment and fascination.

>There aren't enough girls in the class and the class isn't friendly to girls.

I do my best to make my classes friendly to ALL my students.  But the field 
itself, is INTRINSICALLY "unfriendly".  Compilers are neither gentle nor 
polite when your code is wrong.  Computers are not kind when they let you 
know that your code crashed.

I've had female colleagues and students who were quite good at 
programming.  They shared the level of commitment and fascination I'm 
talking about.  I do my best to display and impart my enthusiasm for this 
field, but there has to be a certain amount of intrinsic interest coming in 
the other direction.

The field of programming is hard-edged and unforgiving.  You can make the 
field SEEM more friendly, but you're just creating an illusion.  Students 
attracted by that illusion will be dismayed and discouraged when they 
encounter the actual harsh reality.  Your code doesn't work, you don't know 
why not, and it's going to take hours of hitting your head against the wall 
to make that light bulb go on.  You have to really LOVE this stuff to put 
in those hours.
