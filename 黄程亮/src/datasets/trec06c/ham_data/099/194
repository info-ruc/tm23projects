I agree with everything you said, EXCEPT....

"Courses are dry and boring.  They are too abstract.  Too much focus on
picky details."

What else are computers BUT picky details?  If you enter the wrong
information into a program you are writing or software you are using, you
end up with the wrong answer.  This is true in ALL CS fields, especially
graphic design, where a 1/8" mistake could cost you thousands at the
printer.

"Do more than just program.  Computer Science is not just programming! 
Emphasize the creative aspects of computing: design, graphics,
human-computer interaction.  Show how computers are used in medicine,
manufacturing, space exploration, entertainment."

This is true.  Students in my school can take video production, web
design, computer animation, etc.  If they are in my classroom, they will
program.  We already talk about all the different things that you can
create programs for in my class, but what you are talking about is a
guidance issue.  Also, those other classes are flooded with young women. 
Shouldn't we concentrate on getting them to realize that programming makes
everything else possible, and is therefore the most important?  Shouldn't
we focus on getting the best and brightest young women to try for the
harder and more abstract courses?

As with all education, we should focus on doing what is right, not what
will look good on a histogram.

Yours,
