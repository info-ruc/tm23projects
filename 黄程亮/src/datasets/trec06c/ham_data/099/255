	The forward slash schedules a blank frame which erases the previous
frame, where "This" would appear. You don't see it because there is no
default frame duration, e.g., <fd 50>.  But you don't need it -- you want
the word to stay on the screen until the subject responds.

	If you insert a $ sign before a group of items, and again at the
end, those items appear in that position in a fixed sequence.

	But if you scramble a MAZE file, the individual items that make up
the sentence will get scrambled.  One way to cope is to set a grouping
factor, e.g., <g 12>.  This effectively defines a group of 12 items to be a
single item as far as scrambling is concerned.  This means you'd have to
make all your sentences the same length (12 words in this case).  If some
are shorter, you can include "dummy" items, such as in the following:
 =1 *" This";
 -2 *" information cars";
 +3 *" wet must";
 +4 *" rabbit be";
 -5 *" kept bed";
 +6 *" sanitation. secret.";
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;
0 c;

These are "instructions" that don't display anything.  The "c" is necessary
to reinstate continuous running so that DMDX goes on to the next item
without waiting.   So, if you had 20 sentences, you'd include <s 20> <g 12>
on the parameter line.

There are more sophisticated procedures that achieve the same effect.  I
have developed an Excel template for constructing MAZE files.  If you are
interested let me know (mail to me not the list).
