Hi All,

I'm trying to run an experiment using .jpg pictures and .avi movies. I got it
running on my PC with DMDX 3.0.2.5 with no problems whatsoever.

Yesterday I tried to get the same script to run on my laptop. It didn't work, no
.jpg or .avi files would show. Now I have DMDX 3.1.2.1 on the laptop and the
.jpg files work, but I get the following message as soon as an .avi file comes
up:

"failed to create sample. VFW_S_RESOURCE_NOT_NEEDED (88760250) The resource
specified is no longer needed"

What do I do now? I've tried downloading DMDX 3.0.4.3 (a suggestion from the
mailing list archive), but I get 3.1.2.1 instead.




Thanks,


Carrie
