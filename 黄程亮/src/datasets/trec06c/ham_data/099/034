   Now, that's an interesting one, the windows video codec is complaining 
that there's more than it needs in the .AVI file, weird.

   It's not a DMDX version problem (as a side note vary rarely will an 
earlier version of DMDX be a better thing to use), it's a Video For Windows 
problem.  Sometime in the past you've either upgraded the Media Player on 
that desktop machine or installed something else that's given it expanded 
capabilities w.r.t. .AVI files.  You need to install whatever that was on 
the laptop too.  If you can't recall what it was I recommend upgrading the 
Windows Media Player first as it upgrades a ton of different video related 
things.
