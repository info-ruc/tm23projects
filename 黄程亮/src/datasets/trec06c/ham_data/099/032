   Duh, -1 or 1.  The default Analyze cutoffs are going to make a complete 
mess of that because they're assuming RTs are in milliseconds, not the 
values true or false.  <NoTimeLimit> was introduced back in the bad old 16 
bit days when an RT of 32 seconds was the longest possible RT and someone 
wanted a longer RT than that.  These days with the limit being a large part 
of a month <ntl> is largely useless, surprises me how many people try to 
use it.  If you want really long RTs set the time limit to something really 
big, like <t 10000000>.
