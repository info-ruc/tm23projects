Subject: our office in Cluj

Dear Candy,

I have told you about our company setting up an office in Cluj-Napoca.
We are planning to open our office in September and will be in Romania
all summer.

We are offering website hosting solutions to webdesign agencies and
SME's. We also offer internet applications mainly for the Dutch/European
market and are planning to outsource this activity starting in 2006. Our
website will be up in march/april.

We will open up a sales & support office in Cluj and are actually
looking for local networking organizations in Romania (Cluj) and
connections to the University of Cluj in Information Technology.

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
Marieke Hensel
