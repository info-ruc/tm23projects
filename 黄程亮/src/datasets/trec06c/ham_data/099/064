   Yes, but the keywords have to be in the body of the item, not before 
it.  You've probably got:

+10 "frame" * ; <umb +space>
+11 "frame" * ;

   You need:

+10 "frame" * <umb +space> ;
+11 "frame" * ;

   However you can't un-map the abort key name.  You'll have to temporarily 
map some other key that has a much lower chance of being accidentally hit 
instead and then map the space bar back again.
