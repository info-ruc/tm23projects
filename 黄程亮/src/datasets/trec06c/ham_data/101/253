What was the specific malfunction? Was there damage to the dewar
itself? Was there leaking more severe than the normal hissing that was
occurring when the dewars were delivered? It's been my experience that
the valves and hose and spigots get covered in a thick layer of frost
while using the ln2 over the course of the evening, is this what is
being described, or something more severe? Nobody here knew anything
was wrong with the dewar(s) until Saturday, more than 36 hours after
we last touched them. As far as I know, all that happened was that we
wheeled the dewars across the lobby, and accessed the LN2 via the
valves and spigots. We then wheeled them over to the corner at 12:30
Friday morning and left.
