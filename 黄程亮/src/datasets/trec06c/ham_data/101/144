  I lied, Quinn saved some garb from last year's CryoFAC. We have 7
safety goggles, which should be enough. We also have two complete large
jumpsuits and two complete extra-large jumpsuits, plus two hoods and two
extra sets of large bottoms, one with a leg torn off (?) (they're still
good for someone who wants to look cool but not run the hose...) The
jumpsuits smell like a year's worth of Putz closet but are very clean
and wearable.

Now I'm going to Home Depot tomorrow and getting:

4 Tarps
non-slip mats
9 pairs of the gloves
4 rolls of duct tape
Jumpsuits: 5 large jumpsuit bottoms
              7 extra-large jumpsuit bottoms
              7 large jumpsuit tops
              7 extra-large jumpsuit tops
...or less if you agree that we don't REALLY need nine full jumpsuits...
According to all the photos, nobody wears the hoods, so I'm skipping
those unless there's a good reason.

  Sorry for the onslaught of email, just wanted you to know where the
money is going!

~Em
