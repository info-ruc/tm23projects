   As mentioned elsewhere classic RecordVocal is busted when used with the 
DigitalVOX on most people's machines.  Use the RecordVocal device with a 
parameter to specify how long to record after the VOX has triggered.  For 
example, <id recordvocal 700> <id digitalvox>.

Carelessly planned projects take three times longer to complete than
expected.  Carefully planned projects take four times longer to
complete than expected, mostly because the planners expect their
planning to reduce the time it takes.
