All,

Some few months ago now someone inquired about a Dell Inspiron 6000,
well I'm thinking of buying a Dell Inspiron 6000UMA 1600GT. (dont know
what the UMA 1600GT means) Does anyone know if the 6000 range works. I
think it was Anna Woollams who said she was going to ordered one. I'd
really appreciate it if someone could let me know if it worked,
especially the UMA 1600GT version.

warm regards,
