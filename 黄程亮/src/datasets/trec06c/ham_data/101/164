Good morning Mr. Jordan,
I would like to order two 230 liter low pressure dewars of LN2, to be
delivered to the lobby of W34 during the day of Thursday, 4/7 and picked
up from the lobby of W34 during the morning of Friday, 4/8, to be paid
for with the internal MIT account of 2720000.  The safety plan is
attached and has been Safety-office approved.

Sorry for the short notice,
Rob Radez

Delivery & Pick up of the Dewar
--On Thurs 4/7 when BOC delivers two 230 liter low pressure dewars of LN2 to
the lobby of W34, students will be scheduled to stand by the dewars and prevent 
unauthorized use of LN2.  The dewars will not be left unattended.  The dewars 
will be kept in the corner of the W34 lobby away from passers-by.
--When the ice cream production is complete, the dewars will be locked up in 
the snack-bar room in W34.
--BOC will pick up the dewars on Fri 4/8.  The receptionist at the W34/35 
lobby desk will unlock the door.
--Matthew McGann, Assistant Director of Admissions, is the responsible adult
for this event.  The requisition will be signed by Rob Radez, Quinn Mahoney, 
Paul Abel, or Harvey Jones (depending on drop-off time).

--The protective gear will be worn by the mixers, holders, pourers and 
dispensers of LN2 includes:  thick polyvinyl gloves that cover the 
forearms, long pants, boots or closed toed shoes, safety goggles, and rain
slicker.  The students will not pour LN2 on their shoes or legs.  The
dispensing will be done on a table and the shielded hose will be aimed into the
pot.  Also, the students will practice good sense and be intelligent about
using the LN2.
--Duties of each role will be reviewed with everyone
--Food safety supervisor role will be responsible for reminding students to 
follow the guidelines in the "Serving Safe Food Function Guide" provided by 
the Campus Dining office, including having hair tied back and wearing 
gloves.  There will be two food supervisors, one at each food 
location.  The function guide is available from Ward Ganger at 617-253-2706.


Step 1:  Ice Cream Batter
Cream, milk, and flavoring are mixed according to specified recipe in 
a large metal pot.  The pot is then covered and immediately transported to
Mixing Station, or refrigerated until needed. (due to restricted refrigeration
space, batters will be mixed on an as needed basis as much as possible)
-kitchen crew familiar with food safety, hair tied back, washed hands, 
gloves, etc.
This will be done in the W11 catering kitchen.

Step 2: Transport
Batter is Transported to Mixing Station in Covered Pot.  If the weather is 
bad, the batter will be transported by a vehicle.

Step 3. LN2 and Mixing
a.  LN2 is dispensed into a smaller dewar through shielded hoses.  Dispenser
wears protective gear as described above.  The 2 dewars are connected by the
shielded hoses so LN2 cannot splash during transfer.  The smaller dewar is then
carried over to the mixing station by 3 people.
b. Liquid Nitrogen is dispensed into batter from smaller dewar using 
shielded hose and nozzle.
	 -3 mixers, all wearing protective gear as described above and with
	 hair tied back.  Rain slicker will be worn with sleeves over gloves to
	 prevent LN2 from running down inside the glove.
         -Person 1 mixes batter using wooden spoon, person 2 dispenses the 
liquid nitrogen through a shielded hose with a nozzle, person 3 holds metal 
pot to avoid spillage.  Jobs rotate throughout the evening to prevent 
fatigue.  Communication between the mixer, pourer, and holder to prevent 
LN2 from being poured onto mixer.
c. Batter is mixed until frozen.

Step 4: Final Preparation and Serving
a. Ice cream is transferred to a metal serving container (such as a large 
roasting pan)
b. pan is kept cold on serving table --promptly removed when pan is empty, 
ice cream is melting, or in case of contamination
c. ice cream is served into disposable serving bowls (to be eaten with 
plastic spoons)
d. self-serve toppings (sprinkles, syrup, etc.)

Safety Considerations
1. Liquid Nitrogen equipment checked for any malfunction, cleanliness, etc. 
before and during event
2. Only specified "mixers" come in contact with liquid nitrogen and equipment.
3. Mixers wear safety equipment at all times--extra equipment always 
available in case of malfunction/breakage
4. Mixing takes place in a limited access area and on a tarp to prevent 
slipping/mess
5. All perishable items remain refrigerated unless in immediate use
6. All items covered to prevent contamination
7. Contaminated items immediately removed and disposed of/cleaned
8. Clean up is an on-going process
9. Extra people on hand to monitor serving tables, safety issues, etc.
10. Spectators will be kept away from LN2 using TensaBarrier type barriers or
tables without blocking evacuation paths.
11. At the end of the event, if there is residual LN2 left over, once the
spectators have left, it will be taken outside and vented into the atmosphere.
