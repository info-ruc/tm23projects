Howdy,
Sorry for asking on such short notice, but would you be interested in
spinning at the CPW welcome party tomorrow night?  I'm not sure if
you've seen the emails going around about Cryofac, but we're making LN2
ice cream for all the prefrosh and we've normally got music going on
also.  Marcos recommended that I ask you.

Rob
