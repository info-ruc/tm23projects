Hi All,

I've recently upgraded our DMDX labs from Windows 98 machines to new 
Windows XP (SP2) machines.  The machines we got were Dell Dimension 
8400s with ATI Radeon X300 video cards.

I'm now only requiring people to only have user rights to the machines. 
  This is to stop people bringing in and installing their own software 
onto them.  These machines are optimised to run DMDX only and we want 
to keep it that way.

One quirk we've noticed is that the computer name is not being recorded 
in the .azk file.  Instead <unidentified> is being recorded in its 
place.  When I log in with an administrator account the computer name 
is recorded.

Does anyone have any ideas?

thanks,
Craig
