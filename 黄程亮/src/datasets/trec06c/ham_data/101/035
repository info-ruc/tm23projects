   You'll have to keep track of the error rates individually, the internal 
error rate counters will never do what you need.  So for each prototype 
you'll need a counter for the number of correct responses and a counter for 
the total number of responses and then a branch that calculates the error 
rates and branches if any of them are too low.

   Correct response counters will be 10, 20, 30 and 40, totals will be 11, 
12, 13 and 14. You'll want to repeat the 1000, 2000, 3000 and 4000 items as 
many times as data points you wish to gather.  The <emit> keywords are for 
debugging.
