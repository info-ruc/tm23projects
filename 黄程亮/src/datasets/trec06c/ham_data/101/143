Hey Rob:
  I'm planning to go to Home Depot w/ ladaher's car to get:
-4 Tarps
-non-slip mats (enough to cover walking areas around the mixing station
and serving area)
-9 pairs of beefy gloves (or as many as they have...)
-9 pairs safety goggles
-4 rolls of duct tape
-9 slickers/jumpsuits

  The slickers were listed under "donated by EC", but we threw them all
away last year, so we definitely need more.
  Do we really need 9 of everything? I'm all for having extras too, but
on the jumpsuits especially it'll save $$ to buy only 6 or so (6 would
fully cover two mixing stations). I just don't want to come back with
more than we need.
If this all looks right to you we'll go tonight.

~Em
