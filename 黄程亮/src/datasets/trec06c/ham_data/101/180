Hey -
  I have receipts for the two Home Depot trips, which come to $408.21.
That covers:
  4 Tarps
  2 big non-stick mats
  9 pairs industrial rubber gloves
  4 rolls of duct tape
  5 yellow suits (we already had 4).

  We already have 7 pairs of safety goggles which should be enough.

  The CostCo trip (leaving at 4:30) will cover everything under serving,
toppings, and ingredients except for the dairy and LN2. We'll also get
dish soap, sponges, and whatever "Gel" is. What's gel???
  Last time I counted there were at least five pots lurking around EC.
I'll try and get a hard count before we leave to see how many we should
buy.

~Em
