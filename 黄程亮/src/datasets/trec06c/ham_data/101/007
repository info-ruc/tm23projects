        Small TYPES workshop
"Constructive analysis, types and exact real numbers."
       3/4 October 2005
             Nijmegen, the Netherlands

The workshop will be held at the campus of the Radboud University Nijmegen 
(formerly known as University of Nijmegen or Catholic University of 
Nijmegen). This workshop is part of the TYPES project 
(http://www.cs.chalmers.se/Cs/Research/Logic/Types/)

Topics include, but are not limited to:
    * the development of constructive analysis in type theory
    * program extraction from such developments
    * exact real number computation
    * co-inductive methods for continuous structures
    * semantics for real computations (e.g. domain theory, formal topology)

Invited speakers:
Martín Escardó and Norbert Müller

Deadline for registration:
September 1st 2005.

We are in the process of investigating the possibilities for a post-workshop 
proceedings.

Organizers:
Herman Geuvers 
Nicole Messink 
Milad Niqui
