CryoFAC is tomorrow, which means I need a box made.

Here's the concept: CryoFAC is traditionally advertised on campus the
evening of the event by someone wearing a sort-of four-sided sandwich
board made from a cardboard box (box with signs on it + straps).  The past
two years I've made this more fun by wearing little else in addition to
the box.

Being lazy and devoid of artistic talent, I leave it to someone else to
actually make the box for me.  That's where you come in.  Find a box big
enough for me, attach straps, and make it a billboard for CryoFAC.  Try to
make the stuff on the box really big so people can read it.

no box, no gabi roaming the infinite sketching out prefrosh and their
parents, so get to it!

Thanks,
Gabi
