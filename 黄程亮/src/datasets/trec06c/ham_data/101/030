Dear prof. Forster,
For the training phase of my exp I have 4 prototypes that people have to
recognize; ideally I need to count how many errors they do for each prototype
and if in at least 1 prototype they do not do 80% correct they should start
again. Unfortunately I was not able to do that, so I solved my probl by increasing
the perc of correct that I want overall (90%) and use a simpler ?biert 10?
function.
Could you give me some suggestions on how set the four different counters
as cue for the branching procedure, - I tried to set an error counter for
just one prototype as trial but didn?t work -? I include my code for branching
that seems to work, 
Thank you very much, sorry for the vagueness of my question.
