I talked to the AirGas guy. If there's an extra dewar he can have
delivered tonight, he will. Otherwise, the first dewar should be 95%
full still, and we only used one + a tiny bit last year. If any of you
have ready access to some ln2, we could really use a little margin.
Otherwise, we'll just be conservative with what we have. John Muir
conservative, not Paul Wolfowitz conservative. Call me with any
emerging issues.
