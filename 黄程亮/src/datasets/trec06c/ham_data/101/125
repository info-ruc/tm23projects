Howdy Matt,
Thanks for the mail.  We're in contact with Safety but I'm not sure of
the current proper person to contact in DAPER regarding certain
logistics (namely whether it's alright for us to get Dewars delivered
earlier in the day again, and returning them the next morning).  Also,
when would we get access to the chapel kitchen?

Thanks,
Rob
