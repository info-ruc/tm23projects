Precedence: list

I have a procedure in which subjects report the location of a target 
item (whilst ignoring another itme).  There are 4 possible locations 
(up, down, left, right).  In a Turbo Pascal implementation on older 
(DOS) machines, I used a digital joystick.

It is not clear to me (from reading help files) whether DMDX can handle 
4 inputs like this.  Can it?  Or is it limited to YES, NO, and START?

Thanks,
Bruce
