   TimeDX 3.1.06 now has code in that overrides the use of a direct port 
address in the PIO test when the operating system doesn't allow direct port 
access.  Prior to this it wouldn't enumerate those ports as choices when 
they weren't available, now it specifically won't allow their use even if 
you type a port number in.  DMDX still won't check and will crash if you 
hack the registry to use a port address on a machine that's running NT, 2K 
or XP.

   DMDX 3.1.2.6 should now be able to determine the machine's name when 
running in a restricted privilege environment.  Earlier it would ask for 
complete access to the registry key that contains the machine name even 
though it didn't need it, now it just asks for read access which should be 
available.

   You should hardly ever equivocate.
