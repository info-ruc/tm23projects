CryoFAC is tomorrow. It will be awesome. I'd like people to be staking
out the Johnson lobby from roughly 11AM till the event. Please please
email me to volunteer for shifts. I won't stick you there the whole
day, promise.

Everyone else, meet on Putz at 6:00. People will tell you what to do.
We will need lots of carry-ers and lots and lots of setup help.

Cleanup starts at midnight. Be there. Seriously.

Someone please mail galb about making him a box.

I'm going to try to be in cell phone contact all day, except from 1-3.
If there's an emergency, I'll know what to do, or at least who to ask.
617-803-8273.

LN2 will be delivered sometime tomorrow. ladaher and I are doing a
dairy run. All the materials have been bought. Things are going to be
awesome.

Harvey
