As I mentioned in my February 28 e-mail to cryofac, these are 316 stainless
flex hoses with 1/2" female SAE flare fittings on each end.  You can buy
them from McMaster-Carr.  I can look up the part number if you want.  They
cost $50-100 each.

If you're going shopping you might as well pick up a sintered bronze
phase separator for the end of the hose, which reduces transfer losses
caused by gas bubbles spraying into the open container you're filling.

There is supposed to be a hose in the Putz closet attached to the small dewar.
