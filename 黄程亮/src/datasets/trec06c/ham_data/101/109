Rob....

I wanted to make sure you had received a confirmation that you did receive 
the space and funding ($1991) that you requested for the CPW Festival on 
Thursday April 7.  I had a problem with my computer's hard drive a week or 
two ago and am concerned that the first confirmation email didn't make it 
to everyone.  There will be an additional email coming out later this week 
that will talk more about the Festival logistics.
