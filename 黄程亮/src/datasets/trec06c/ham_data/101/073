   Forgot to mention in the last reply I made about classic mode 
RecordVocal's data not being reliable, it's reliable under Windows ME and 
probably all the 9X variants.  It's only under XP that classic mode is 
busted and given that absolutely no one wanted it's functionality given the 
enhanced mode there was no incentive to go make it work.  If I do anything 
at this stage it'll be to disable it outright as I can no longer (or more 
precisely not easily) test ME or 9X functionality.
