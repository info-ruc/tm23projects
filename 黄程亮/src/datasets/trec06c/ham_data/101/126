Subject: things to do

howdy folks,
so i promised things would start hopping more after spring break, and
they are.  we've got funding, we've got space, we've almost got safety
office approval.  so now, we need to buy ingredients and various other
supplies.  a week from today, we'll need to get everything moved over to
johnson, get everything prepped in the chapel kitchen, make ice cream
for a crapload of prefrosh, and get everything cleaned up.

harvey's taking care of ordering ln2 as soon as I get the final ok from
safety.

who wants to be in charge of buying shit?  ideally someone with a car
will also be involved in this.  there's a listing of shit in the budget
which is available on request.

who wants to be in charge of arranging for, paying for, and acquiring
dairy products?

who wants to buy two dewar hoses?

we're going to need many people in the kitchen helping prepare the ice
cream before it gets frozen.  i promise that if you want to mix ln2 and
ice cream batter, you will be given the opportunity to.  being in the
kitchen is one of the most important jobs.  you don't have to do it all
night but every bit helps.

we're going to need people serving the ice cream, and mixing it.

we're going to need help cleaning everything up afterwards.
