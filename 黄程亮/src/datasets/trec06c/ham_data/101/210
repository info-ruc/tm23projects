  The second dewar is here!!! It appeared, of course, during the five
minutes when I was checking my email, but it's here!
  I'm sticking around Johnson until 3PM-ish, so someone come take over
for me in the next 20 minutes. It's pretty easy: you bring some homework
and sit next to two big metal dewars. They're good company.
  If you want you can sit in a yellow suit and gloves. That oughta make
the "MIT is a very athletic school" tours that have been coming through
ever ten minutes a bit more entertaining...
