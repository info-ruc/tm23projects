   It's faintly possible that you could specify the durations of the frames 
playing the video to be longer than the video with something like this:

+1 * <dv> "name" <%ms 30000> / ;

   But there's a bunch of mechanisms in there that take into account that 
the rest of the item is to begin when the video finishes so I'm not betting 
that overriding the frame's duration isn't going to work.

Carelessly planned projects take three times longer to complete than
expected.  Carefully planned projects take four times longer to
complete than expected, mostly because the planners expect their
planning to reduce the time it takes.
