CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

COMPUTABILITY IN EUROPE 2005: NEW COMPUTATIONAL PARADIGMS (CiE 2005)
http://www.illc.uva.nl/CiE/

June 8 - June 12, 2005
Amsterdam, The Netherlands

The organizers of CiE 2005 cordially invite researchers working in all
areas of computability theory, ranging from mathematics to computer
science, to participate in the conference taking place in Amsterdam in
June 2005.

CiE 2005 is an interdisciplinary venue for researchers from computer
science and mathematics focusing on New Computational Paradigms. These
include prominently connections between computation and physical systems
but also higher mathematical models of computation. The researchers from
the different communities will exchange ideas, approaches and techniques
in their respective work, thereby generating a wider community for work on
computational issues that allows uniform approaches to diverse areas, the
transformation of theoretical ideas into applicable projects, and general
cross-fertilization transcending disciplinary borders.

There will be two three-hour tutorials, eight plenary talks, six special
sessions with altogether 25 talks and over 50 contributed talks covering
the entire range of research in computability theory.

PLENARY TALKS:
http://www.illc.uva.nl/CiE/index.php?page=12

Three-hour tutorials - Harry Buhrman (Amsterdam), Klaus Weihrauch (Hagen).

Plenary talks - Samson Abramsky (Oxford), Joel D. Hamkins (New York NY),
Ulrich Kohlenbach (Darmstadt), Jan van Leeuwen (Utrecht), Yuri
Matiyasevich (St.Petersburg), Yiannis Moschovakis (Athens/Los Angeles CA),
Gheorghe Paun (Bucharest), Uwe Schoening (Ulm).

Introductory lecture - Andrew Hodges (Oxford).

SPECIAL SESSIONS:
http://www.illc.uva.nl/CiE/index.php?page=6

Biological Computation
Organiser: Thomas Baeck (Leiden).

Complexity

INFORMAL PRESENTATIONS:
http://www.illc.uva.nl/CiE/index.php?page=17

In addition to the formal presentations based on the LNCS proceedings
volume, we invite researchers to present informal presentations. For this,
please send us a brief description of your talk (between one paragraph and
half a page) before April 15th, 2005. Submission form:
http://www.illc.uva.nl/CiE/index.php?page=_6

REGISTRATION AND ACCOMMODATION:
http://www.illc.uva.nl/CiE/index.php?page=13

Regular registration (EUR 95, EUR 75 for students) will be possible until
April 30th, 2005. After May 1st, 2005, there will be an option of Late
Registration with higher fees.
Registration form:
https://www.science.uva.nl/research/illc-secure/CiE/index.php?page=10

We have reserved some rooms in Amstel Botel at a special university rate.
The Amstel Botel (reservation deadline April 25th, 2005) is located at
Oosterdokskade 2-4, next to the Central Station, and is a modern and
luxurious floating hotel. A unique experience and an alternative way to
get to know the lively city of Amsterdam. From the Botel it takes 20
minutes by tram to the conference site.

IMPORTANT DATES:

April 15th, 2005 - Deadline for submission of informal presentations.
April 25th, 2005 - Deadline for booking at Amstel Botel.
April 30th, 2005 - Deadline for regular conference registration.

SPONSORSHIP:

The conference is sponsored/supported by the Association for Symbolic
Logic (ASL), European Association for Theoretical Computer Science
(EATCS), Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), Royal
Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW).

PROGRAM COMMITTEE:

Klaus Ambos-Spies (Heidelberg), Albert Atserias (Barcelona), Barry Cooper
(Leeds, co-chair), Sergei Goncharov (Novosibirsk), Benedikt Loewe
(Amsterdam, co-chair), Dag Normann (Oslo), Helmut Schwichtenberg
(Muenchen), Andrea Sorbi (Siena), Ivan Soskov (Sofia), Leen Torenvliet
(Amsterdam), John Tucker (Swansea), Johan van Benthem
(Amsterdam/Stanford), Peter van Emde Boas (Amsterdam), Jiri Wiedermann
(Praha).
