THE OPERATIONS OFFICER,
BILL AND EXCHANGE OF THE
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT
STANDARD BANK LTD,
LAGOS-NIGERIA.
E-MAIL: sulesy@hotmail.com

DEAR SIR,

I am writing to you, following the impressive information about your 
profile through the Website,and I believe in your capability and 
reliability to champion this opportunity.In my department, we 
discovered an abandoned sum of US$25Million Dollars(Twenty Five 
Million US Dollars) in an account that belongs to late (Mr Stephen)
one of our foreign customers who died along with his entire family on 
21st April,1999 In a car accident. Since we got information about his 
death, we have been expecting his next of Kin to come over and claim 
his money because we can not release it unless some body applies for 
it as next of Kin or relative to the deceased as indicated in our 
banking and financial policies but unfortunately we learnt that his 
supposed next of kin or relation died with him in the accident 
leaving nobody behind to claim the money.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this business proposal to you and 
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the 
deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody has come 
for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury as 
unclaimed bills.

The Banking law and guide line here stipulates that if such money 
remained unclaimed after two and half years, the money will be 
transferred into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.The request for 
a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact 
that the customer was a foreigner and an indigene cannot stand as 
next of kin to the deceased family.

We agreed that 30 of this money will be for you as foreign partner, 
in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10% will be set 
aside for expenses incurred during this transaction and 60% would be 
for me and my colleagues.

Thereafter,I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.Therefore, to 
enhance the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged,you 
must apply first to the Bank as relation or next of kin of the 
deceased indicating your private, telephone and fax number for easy 
and effective communication and location where the money will be 
remitted. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-
mail, the text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your 
notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not 
entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been 
made for the transfer.

You should contact me as soon as you receive this letter. I decided 
to contact you as you have interesting products in your part of the 
world where we can invest our own percentage to avoid peoples 
awareness as we are civil servants Note that we can conclude this 
operation within ten banking days.Please keep this very confidential 
for obvious security reasons. Contact me for more information 
confirmable before you apply if you want. Trusting to hear from you 
shortly for a detailed information which are confirmable before you 
can make up your mind to apply. I will not contact anybody else until 
I hear from you.

Best Regards,
Mr Akeem Sulesy.
