   Nothing leaps to mind, the duration of those frames is going to be set 
by the duration of the video file.  You'd have to know the duration of the 
files and pad them with blank frames of appropriate durations.

   Possible but 360 ticks should be more than long enough -- then again 
maybe your computer is really slow.  TimeDX's Digital Video test displays 
some stats, like the Run Transition Time, you might want to play the files 
and see what those values are.

   Look at the <MediaLife> keyword, it works for Digital Video.

   You should hardly ever equivocate.
