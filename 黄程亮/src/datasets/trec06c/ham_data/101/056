Dear all:
  I am using DMDX to run experiments on Chinese speech production. I found some questions of my results. Maybe you folks can help me with these problems.
  My experiment event is like this, the subject first see a phrase ('an apple") on the screen, then s/he hears a wav. file ('what did he eat') through the headphones. They were requested to respond on hearing the question. I set the voice detection and recording voice starting from the onset of the question. The script looks like this: 

N160 s160 <azk> <cr> f38 <t 3600> <dwc 000000000> <dbc 255255255> <id "keyboard"> <mr +Space> <id "RecordVocal"> <nfb> <id "digitalvox"> <eop>  

+889   <ms% 2000>/ "+"/<dbc 255255255> <dwc 000000000> "an apple"/ <ms% 500> / * <wav 2> "Q1.wav" / ;


  As in my script, I set the recording duration lasting for 3600 ms. However, I found that some recorded sound files (wav. files) are contracted. I got some files that only last for 3300 ms. I am not sure how that would happen. Is it possible that when the subject reponds before the question file is finished, the recorded sound files would be contracted? I don't think that will be the case. I checked the voice detection time (RT, reaction time of voice onset). If the above causes the problem, then all the response times should be longer than the duration of the question file. BUT, most of the RT are actually shorter than the question duration. Did anyone else find similar problems? Or could it be any bugs?
  Second, since those recorded sound files are contracted, I don't know whether their RTs are still accurate. Even though they are contracted to be a shorter sound file, DMDX still gave me their RTs. Can those still be reliable?
 
  Thank you !  Have a great day!
 
sincere wishes,
Chuck
