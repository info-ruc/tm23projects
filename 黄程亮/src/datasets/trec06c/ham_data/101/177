Good afternoon Ms. Lett,
Matt McGann gave me your name as the person in DAPER to contact
regarding the CPW welcome party this Thursday night.  As part of this,
for the past two years Admissions has had my hall at East Campus provide
liquid nitrogen ice cream to the pre-frosh.  Once again this year, we
need to get two dewars of liquid nitrogen delivered early in the day and
have one of us sitting by it until that evening, and we also need to
setup our equipment beforehand along with borrowing some of the
Tensa-barrier equipment from DAPER to do crowd-control.  After the
event, we need to store the dewars overnight until Airgas can come pick
them up Friday morning.  I hope that this does not cause any problems
and I apologize for contacting you with such short notice.  

Regards,
Rob Radez
