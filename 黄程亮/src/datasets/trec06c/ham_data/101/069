Dear Steffen,

It appears that Production has been able to clarify reference style =
questions posed by Walt Grantham.  I am passing this message on to you =
in the event that other contributors ask you similar questions.  The =
most relevant points are highlighted below in red.

Perhaps these points can be added to the Annals submission website.

Best regards,

Tom
