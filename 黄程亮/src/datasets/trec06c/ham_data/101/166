Good morning Mr. Jordan,
I would like to order two 230 liter low pressure dewars of LN2, to be
delivered to the lobby of W34 during the day of Thursday, 4/7 and picked
up from the lobby of W34 during the morning of Friday, 4/8, to be paid
for with the internal MIT account of 2720000.  The safety plan is
attached and has been Safety-office approved.

Sorry for the short notice,
Rob Radez
