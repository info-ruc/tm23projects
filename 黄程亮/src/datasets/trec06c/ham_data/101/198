I need help with a couple of issues arising from my use of DMDX in a lexical decision experiment.
 
1.The SPC parameters include low_cutoff, ie discard RT's faster than x milliseconds. I am proposing to set the parameter to 200ms, but this is fairly arbitrary. I found two references to this in the Discussion Archive: one used 100ms and the other 300ms.
 
I would be interested to know of others' views/experiences with this and/or to see parameter files used for similar experiments. Also, are there any published studies to which I could refer?
 
2.My second question relates to how to get screen prints from DMDX. I have tried the Print Screen key with Paint, but either that does not work or I am doing something wrong!
 
Many thanks if you are able to help.
