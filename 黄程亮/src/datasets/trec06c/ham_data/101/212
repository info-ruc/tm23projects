To everyone that helped with CryoFAC in some way either tonight or in
the past weeks of preparation, I would like to say thank you.  CryoFAC
could not have happened without everyone who was involved, and I hope
that people had fun at the same time.  It seemed like most of the
prefrosh enjoyed themselves tonight, and hopefully they came away from
the night with a good impression of MIT and EC.

Again, thank you all!
Rob
