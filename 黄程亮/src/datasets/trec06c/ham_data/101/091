Hi Patrick, all,

I haven't seen the agenda for the Apr 1-3 meeting, or maybe I missed it,
and I was wondering if a discussion around further data reduction schemes
for S5+ would fall into it.

I guess the problem that I see (at least at MIT) is how to keep up with
24/7 operations from the point of view of what to keep on disk.
To the extend that this is pertinent to the meeting that's coming up,
I find there will be value discussing:

- devising the level-2 RDS scheme [something of the order of 20-30 ?
  channels and a size reduction by 5 ?]

- brute-force approach by running general data characterization algorithms
  (KleineWelle,Q-transform,glitchMON) on ALL LIGO channels before data
  disappear

- devise a scheme for event-driven RDS's (does it exist?):  run several
  algorithms on GW channel (inspiral/burst) take the "OR" of triggers and
  (assuming the global rate is ~mHz, e.g., the "outliers") take, say,
  32 seconds centered on each event from ALL LIGO/GEO channels for further
  event analysis. For example the online trigger generation could do this
  extraction of time series from all IFO channels around each event.

Hope this is helpful.

Thanks,
--Erik
