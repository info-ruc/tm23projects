Hi,
We are trying to figure out some timing with videos. 
We are trying to have short videos play (each between
4-5 seconds), followed by a fixed 6 second ISI.  I
tried running a simple code to make sure that the d
and fd parameters are timed correctly...
<zil> <d 100> <fd 300> <cr> <rcot> <nfb>
0 "start";
+1 * "first"/ !;
+2 * "second"/ !;
+3 * "third"/ !;
0 "stopped";

...using the clock on times from the .zil output file
to measure the msec's between items -works fine.  I
then tried that with my dv file...

 <zil> <cr> <vm 800, 600, 600, 32, 0> <id keyboard>
<dwc 0> <mr +space> <mnr +left shift> <mpr +right
shift> <rcot> <fm 1.5> <bc 187187187> <nfb> <fd 255>
<d 360>

0 <line -2> "This is a trial experiment.",
<line -1>  "If the following video clip plays in real
time",
"press the RIGHT shift key",
<line 1> "If the video clip does not play in real
time",
<line 2>  "press the LEFT shift key";

^99 <fd 1810> * <bmp> "LO_High_still_pic.bmp"/;
+10 <dv> * "APour_LO_High_F2-02cut.avi" / !; 
-11 <dv> * "APour_LO_High_F2-04cut.avi" / !;
-12 <dv> *  "APour_LO_High_F2-06cut.avi" / !;
-13 <dv> *  "APour_LO_High_F2-08cut.avi" / !;
+14 <dv> * "Pour_LO_High_F2-Origcut.avi" / !;
-15 <dv> * "Pour_LO_High_F2-01cut.avi" / !;
-16 <dv> * "Pour_LO_High_F2-02cut.avi" / !;
-17 <dv> * "Pour_LO_High_F2-03cut.avi" / !;
-18 <dv> * "Pour_LO_High_F2-04cut.avi" / !;

0 <line -1>  "This is the end of the experiment.",
"Thank you for your participation!";

...But when I check the timing, the first clock on
time  is 348 msec slow, then the next is 431 msec
slow, and it keeps increasing like that.  Even if I
eliminate the <fd> in my header line, it doesn't seem
to make much of a difference in my .zil file output. 
I also tried putting a <fd> switch before each dv item
(since each video is a different length) and that
didn't fix the timing either.  How might I set the
frame durations for each video, being each a different
length, while also having a 30 second still picture at
the beginning?  Is the time discrepancy in my .zil
file due to the video loading time?  I read about how
to pre-load a bitmap (putting a 'g' in the item line),
but I don't think you can pre-load movies.  I would
greatly appreciate if you have any clarification for
this.  
Thank you much
