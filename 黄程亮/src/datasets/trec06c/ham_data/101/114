  I'm currently in charge of buying stuff(I don't have a car, but I can find
people who do). I'll check out the list and what we have from last year, and
start making trips this weekend. This, as far as I know, encompasses the Home
Depot stuff (goggles, gloves, suits, tarps) and the Costco stuff (a metric
shit-ton of sugar, cocoa, etc.) The Home Depot run will probably go faster with
only a couple people to haul stuff, but as more helpers are needed I'll make it
known.
  I also have no classes on Thursday, so I'll try to field some of the
"shit-shit-we-need-*foo*" stuff...
