I.B.M. HOPES TO PROFIT BY MAKING PATENTS AVAILABLE FREE
from The New York Times (Registration Required)

I.B.M. is renowned for its rich storehouse of patented inventions. It once
again led the research sweepstakes in America last year, collecting 3,248
patents, more than any other company. And it earned more than $1 billion
last year from licensing and selling its ideas.

So why has I.B.M. shifted course recently, giving away some of the fruits of
its research instead of charging others to use it? The answer is self-interest.

Diverging from conventional wisdom, the company has calculated that sharing
technology can sometimes be more profitable than jealously guarding its
property rights on patents, copyrights and trade secrets. The moves by
I.B.M., the world's largest supplier of information technology services and
computers, are being closely watched throughout the business world.
