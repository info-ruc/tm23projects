Hi Harvey, Paul, Quinn, and Rod,

We need your help to determine what caused the dewar to leak and freeze 
up.  We would like to ask you to describe specifically what you did before 
this happened.  We will also check the valve to determine if there was a 
mechanical problem.

Thanks
John Jordan and Katie Blass
