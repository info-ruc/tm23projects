   Then you want to have a scramble emit command, the back slash, between 
each block at the start of a line.  Like this:

   You'll have to use the multi-scrambling options for such a complex 
job.  There's an example in the help that's almost exactly what you want, 
look at

http://psy1.psych.arizona.edu/~jforster/dmdx/help/dmdxhmultiscramblingscramblekeyword.htm

   Your backslash mentioned above will have to become a <ms\ 1> but other 
than that it's a direct rip from the first example.

   Dozens of them.
