Matt Davis's script for importing data from .AZK files appears to 
produce a new file that has as a column of raw RTs for each subject. 
While this may be an improvement on the raw .AZK file, it is still not 
in the form needed for further processing in SPSS (or other stats 
packages).

Perhaps SPSS users will find the following syntax file useful as an 
example of how to import directly to SPSS:

    http://www.angelfire.com/wv/bwhomedir/spss/import_from_AZK.txt

It reads in the rows of the raw .AZK file as 80-character strings, then 
uses string manipulation functions to pull out the desired bits of 
information, and saves the data in a format that is amenable to further 
processing with the AGGREGAGE procedure.  I also have it save the 
original string of info (about subject, scan rate, etc) so that if any 
of the info is needed, it can be easily obtained.

Cheers,
Bruce
