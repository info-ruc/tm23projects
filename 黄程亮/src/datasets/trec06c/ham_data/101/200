  Hello all -
  If anyone needs access to materials before 6pm (like if kitchen people need to
experiment with ingredients or something) call my cell phone to be let into my
room: (508) 662-2314 I'll try to have it on all day.
  If people want to dash around campus and advertise cryofac and look crazy in
yellow jumpsuits and safety goggles, that stuff will be with me at Johnson
starting at around noon. Word-of-mouth advertising is also important. Tell
people to come. It'll rock.

~Em
