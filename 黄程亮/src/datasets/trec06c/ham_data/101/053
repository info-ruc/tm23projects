Subject: [DMDX] Is it possible to stop playing a long WAV file with mouse or keyboard

Hi,

in order to measure time perception with auditive stimuli, I tried to 
build a program DMDX.

Here is the detail of the experiment.
I would like a first sound (demo sound) to be played for a defined time 
(i.e. 4 seconds) on my computer. The sound is a simple note, recorded in 
a 4 seconds long WAV file.
Then, the same sound would be played for an undefined duration (test 
sound). I am using a 1 minute long WAV file so that the maximum response 
time can't be much long.
The user would have to click with the mouse when he thinks that the 
sound has reached the same duration than the first sound (demo sound). 
When he clicks, the test sound would stop and the time between the 
beginning of the test sound and the click would be written in the output 
ascii file. And then the next item, with the same principle, would be 
starting.

My problem is that when I begin to play the test sound with DMDX, and 
when the user clicks, the sound goes on playing until the end of the WAV 
file. Here's a sample of the script I am using :

+1001 / <ms% 1250> / <wav> "4s" / <ms% 500> / *<wav> "1min" ;
+1002 / <ms% 1700> / <wav> "2s" / <ms% 500> / *<wav> "1min" ;

I wonder if my problem can be treated with a software like DMDX, or if I 
have to use another software.

I would be grateful for your help on this subject. Thanks a lot for your 
attention.
