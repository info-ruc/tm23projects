Hello folks.  Has programmed either of the following with DMDX?

1. A basic attentional cuing paradigm as in the Posner & Cohen (1984) 
chapter on inhibition of return.

2. A spatial negative priming paradigm, where subjects select a target 
on the basis of some characteristic (e.g., colour), and report its 
location via key-press or joystick, etc.

Cheers,
Bruce
