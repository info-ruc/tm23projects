Dear Friends, 

Every year, the major fuzzy conference FUZZ-IEEE'06 has either an interval 
session or interval-related talks. Here is the CFp for the 2006 conference. Let 
us have an interval session there as well.

Sponsored by the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society, 2006 IEEE World 
Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI 2006), to be held in Vancouver, 
British Columbia, Canada from July 16-21, 2006, is the best known academic 
Olympic event in computational intelligence community.  Joined by three premier 
international events, International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 
(IJCNN), IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE), and IEEE 
Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), WCCI 2006 will provide a venue to 
foster technical exchanges, renew everlasting friendship, and establish new 
connections. The Congress will bring together researchers and practitioners in 
the area of theory, design, implementation, and applications of computational 
intelligence. The Congress will feature world-renowned plenary and invited 
speeches, state-of-the-art special sessions, themed tutorial workshops, 
moderated panel discussions, regular technical sessions, poster interactions, 
and last but not least, exciting social functions that include welcoming 
reception, award banquet, student reception, and farewell reception.

For general inquiries, please contact General Chair Gary Yen at 
gyen@okstate.edu <mailto:gyen@okstate.edu> . For program inquiries, contact 
IJCNN Program Chair Lipo Wang at elpwang@ntu.edu.sg <mailto:elpwang@ntu.edu.sg> 
, FUZZ-IEEE Program Chair Piero Bonissone at bonissone@research.ge.com 
<mailto:bonissone@research.ge.com> , or CEC Program Chair Simon M. Lucas at 
sml@essex.ac.uk <mailto:sml@essex.ac.uk> .

 

Call for Special Sessions

IJCNN/FUZZ-IEEE/CEC Program Committees also solicits proposals for special 
sessions within the technical scopes of the three conferences. Special sessions 
are organized by internationally recognized experts and aimed to bring together 
researchers in a focused topic. Special sessions have become both a tradition 
and an important component of each conference. Papers submitted for special 
sessions are to be peer-reviewed with the same criteria used for the 
contributed papers. Researchers interested in organizing a special session are 
invited to submit a formal proposal to IJCNN Special Sessions Chair Jun Wang at 
jwang@acae.cuhk.edu.hk <mailto:jwang@acae.cuhk.edu.hk> , FUZZ-IEEE Special 
Sessions Chair Tsu-Tian Lee at president@ntut.edu.tw 
<mailto:president@ntut.edu.tw> , or CEC Special Sessions Chair Carlos A. Coello 
Coello at ccoello@cs.cinvestav.mx <mailto:ccoello@cs.cinvestav.mx> . Special 
session proposal should include the session title, a brief description of the 
scope and motivation, names, contact information and brief CV of the 
organizers. 

 

Call for Tutorials

WCCI 2006 will feature a number of pre-congress tutorials covering fundamental 
and advanced computational intelligence topics. Tutorial proposals, submitted 
to Tutorials Chair via emails, are solicited and should include title, outline, 
expected enrollment, and presenter biography. Any inquires regarding the 
tutorials should address to Tutorial Chair DeLiang Wang at 
dwang@cse.ohio-state.edu <mailto:dwang@cse.ohio-state.edu> .
