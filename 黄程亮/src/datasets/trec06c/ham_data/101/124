Good evening,
I believe the plan for disposing of small amounts of residual LN2 is to
wait until the event is fully over and the crowds have dispersed and
then release the remaining LN2 into the atmosphere outside the building
in an open area.  If this is safe and acceptable, I will incorporate it
into the document and include it in the order information.

Thanks,
Rob Radez
