SATURDAY
One of your dewars is now leaking and we have contacted campus police as 
this appears to be somewhat of an emergency.  It is visibly leaking and the 
outside of the NITRO dewar is freezing up as well as the knobs.  I have 
tried reaching you at 5-6219.  This is the only number I have.
These were to be picked up yesterday!!
Please contact us ASAP

Good afternoon Ms. Lett,<br>

regarding the CPW welcome party this Thursday night.&nbsp; As part of
this,<br>
for the past two years Admissions has had my hall at East Campus
provide<br>
liquid nitrogen ice cream to the pre-frosh.&nbsp; Once again this year,
we<br>
need to get two dewars of liquid nitrogen delivered early in the day

Tensa-barrier equipment from DAPER to do crowd-control.&nbsp; After
the<br>

them up Friday morning.&nbsp; I hope that this does not cause any
