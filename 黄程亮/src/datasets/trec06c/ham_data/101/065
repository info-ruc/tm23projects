Dear Friends, 

This year, Martine Ceberio organized a very good interval-related track at 
SCA'05 in Santa Fe, a track that attracted attention from non-interval folks 
and helped promote our problems and techniques. 

Ray Moore himself was one of the keynote speackers at the conference. 

The organizers are looking for volunteers to organize tracks at the next year's 
conference. Please note: the deadlinefor proposing a track is in 3 weeks. 

Vladik

                CALL FOR TRACK PROPOSALS
                   
The 21th ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC 2006)
April 23 - 27, 2006, Dijon, France

For the past twenty years the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing (SAC) 
has been a primary and international forum for applied computer 
scientists, computer engineers and application developers to gather, 
interact and present their work. The ACM Special Interest Group on 
Applied Computing  (SIGAPP) is the sole sponsor of SAC. 
The conference proceedings are published by ACM and are also available 
online through ACM's Digital Library.

SAC is based on a flexible structure of mostly self-contained and 
self-managed tracks. Over the past years SAC hosted tracks on a 
variety of timely topics such as Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics, 
Coordination Models, Database Technology, Data Mining, Embedded Systems, 
Evolutionary Computing, Parallel and Distributed Systems, 
Mobile Computing, Object-Oriented Programming Systems, Software Engineering, 
and Web Technologies. SAC 2005, which was held in Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA, 
consisted of 30 tracks that hosted 275 accepted papers out of 764 
submissions. More information on past SAC events can be found at 
http://www.acm.org/conferences/sac/

The 21th Annual SAC (SAC 2006) will be held April 23-27, 2006 in 
Dijon, France, and will be hosted by the University de Bourgogne
in Dijon, France. 
The conference Steering Committee solicits proposals for organizing 
and hosting tracks.  Perspective track chairs should submit an up 
to two pages description for organizing a track, which should include 
at least the following items:

1) The proposed title for the track with a description of its aims, 
topics it will cover and rationale for having such a track in SAC. 
This rationale should refer to any related conference events that 
are held regularly and why the proposed track differs from them or 
complements them. The proposed track should not be overly general 
but also not overly specialized, thus being able to attract a wide 
audience of people sharing similar interests. Proposals from industry 
are also welcomed. Despite its name, SAC also welcomes topics of 
mostly theoretical nature, provided there is clear practical potential 
in applying the results of such work.

2) A short description of the activities the track chair will 
undertake upon acceptance of the proposal, to disseminate the 
call-for-papers for his/her track, manage the review process and 
collect final materials from authors of accepted papers. (Specific 
guidelines to track chairs regarding these issues will also be provided.)

3) A short CV of the perspective track chair(s) with reference to 
research interests and publication record directly related to the 
themes of the proposed track, and any previous experience of involvement 
in the organization of similar events (in the interest of brevity, 
reference to a personal web page where such information can be found 
will be sufficient).

All proposals will be reviewed by the Program Chairs with 
respect to the above criteria. The Program Chairs reserve the right to: 
(1) accept a proposal as is, 
(2) require modifications before acceptance, 
(3) recommend merging of similar proposals with a considerable 
overlap in the topics addressed (in this case the track chairs of 
the different proposals will be asked to form a single chair), 
(4) reject a proposal. Upon acceptance of a proposal, the track 
chairs will be notified of their responsibilities in managing the 
affairs of their tracks; as such responsibilities are defined by 
both the ACM and SAC conference rules. The Program Chairs reserve 
the right to cancel at any time a track, if these responsibilities 
are not addressed adequately by the track chair(s).  

Please submit your proposal electronically in any acceptable 
readable form by April 16, 2005 to:

Roger L. Wainwright,
SAC 2006 Program Co-Chair
University of Tulsa
Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA
