Dear Mr. Phillips:

I am writing regarding 2005 subscription renewal to "International 
Mathematics Research Notices" (ISSN 1073- 7928). Volume 2005 will have 
4500± pages (about 200-300 more pages than volume 2004). 2005 subscription 
rates are as follows:

-$2,395 for the print only.
-$2,395 online only subscription.
-$2,874 for the print and online subscription.

In addition, we are still offering "Applied Mathematics Research eXpress" 
(ISSN 1687-1200) and "International Mathematics Research Surveys" (ISSN 
1687-1308) and "International Mathematics Research Papers" (ISSN 1687-3017) 
for free to IMRN subscribers in 2005.

Our online policy for 2005 is as follows: online subscribers ("online only" 
or "print and online") will get perpetual online access to IMRN 1991-2005 
volumes (even if they cancel their subscription in the future).

I would appreciate if you provided me with your subscription status in 
2005. We are concerned that something might be delaying your subscription 
renewal till now, since we have already posted 16 issues of volume 2005 
online and 9 issues were sent to subscribers.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Shereen Bakry
