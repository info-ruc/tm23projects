Subject: Has anyone an icb-routine for 9600b serial connection ?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi,

i used the serialio.c routines to establish a data connection between
the 
Handyboard and a Linux PC and encountered the same problems already
mentioned 
in the mailing list:
1) Only char by char transmission with sleeps between transmissions
worked reliable.
2) The max baud-rate was about 1600 or (200 chars/per second)

It seems that the serialio.c routines serial_getchar() and
serial_putchar() are too 
slow. Looking through the mailing list i didn't find a solution to
increase the 
baud rate.

Has anyone written an icb-routine for serial communication ?

I'am really a little bit frustrated, since i worked hard to establish an
external vision 
system (Pal-video camera, Hauppauge WinTV + LinuxPC), which traces up to
six objects with 
30 fps. Now this is ready, but i can't transmit the data to the
Handyboard at 
this rate (i have to slow down to 10 fps).

Thanks,
Peter
