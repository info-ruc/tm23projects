Does anyone have an email address for Mary Ann Norris from Mattel?  I'm
applying for jobs for next fall and would like to get in touch with her.

As long as I'm writing, does anyone have any leads/connections/advice for
someone applying to educational software and toy companies?  I'm looking for
an R&D or product manager position but don't seem to be having much luck
through the usual channels.

Thanks,

Jason
