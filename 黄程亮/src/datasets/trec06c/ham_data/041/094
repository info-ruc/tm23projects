I've been through Charles Hacker's Buffalo monitor code, the Miniboard GCC
& ICC libraries, the Handyboard ICC libraries, and a few other sources,
and looked at the schematics and data books a lot.  That's the best way to
get intimately familiar with the circuit and the language, but very
time-consuming.

It'd be great if someone were to write up some info for the people just
starting into assembly.  It's a difficult thing to take on if you haven't
done it much before.  Lot's to learn, lot's to get hung up on and few
people to help.  For that matter, once you cut loose from IC and go to any
other compiler, you have to learn the hardware very well in order to make
anything run on it.  No safety net.

Regarding Chuck's libraries:  I'll be looking at them again to see what
else I can port over (Steal... No, I guess it's called code re-use these
days) to the GCC library. The LCD code was just the first thing I needed. 
The circular queue and detach-LCD-yet-still-run-code are nice features and
I made sure to keep them.  Same for multiple display formats.  Never know
when I might get a 20x4 or 40x2 display cheap somewhere.  If I do, I want
to be able to use it.
