How sensitive are the exp bd servo routines to many processes running
concurrently=2E  My servo works fine in a stand alone test file but when I
include it in my main code it gets the "nervous shakes", as if the timing
pulse is fluctuating ( I don't have a scope to verify this)=2E  The main code
starts separate processes for Sharp GP2D02, Photo, Bump, Pyro, User
(scans start button) and a Sonar which I disabled=2E  Some of these
sensors are located on a servo controlled head=2E  What's up?? Am I just
trying to do too much? Can the processes be assigned more or less
"ticks" to resolve this?  Thanks for any suggestions=2E=2E=2E=2E=2E
