Subject: 1. Use of sony-ir functions in program; 2. smooth PWM
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hi everybody!

My first question is about using the sony-ir functions in a program:
After loading sony-ir.icb and executing "sony_init(1)" at the IC prompt,
I can successfully retrieve signals from my sony remote control via the
function
"ir_data(0)", again given at the IC prompt.
However, if I put these functions in a IC program (see below) and
execute it in the Handy Board, "ir_data(0)" keeps returning the value
"0" all the time!
As a beginning IC programmer, I'm obviously missing something here, but
what?

void
run(void)
{
  sony_init(1);
  while(1) {
     printf("Press START ...\n");
     start_press();
     while (1) {
        printf("IR-code = %d\n", ir_data(0));
        sleep(1.0);
        printf("Press STOP...\n");
        sleep(1.0);
        if (stop_button()) break;
      }
   }
}

My second question is about using the smooth PWM-routines. I've
downloaded the 'smooth'  pcode_hb.s19 and lib_hb.c files.
Lib_hb.c has IC code that I believe has been changed in later versions.
For example: the version of lib_hb.c I currently use has no IC code for
_raw_analog, which is implemented in assembly in lib_hb.icb.
Should I copy the smooth PWM routines into my current lib_hb.c and use
it together with my lib_hb.icb?

I'd appreciate your help on these issues!
