Stacking the chips is doable but you will toast them when you get near
their current limit. An easier solution is to use the TI chips to drive
power transistors that are acting as voltage followers. This lets them take
the current. Alternatively you can pull the L293 chips out of the board and
wire the sockets up to some National LM18200 H-bridges that will handle
these motors at 12volts.
