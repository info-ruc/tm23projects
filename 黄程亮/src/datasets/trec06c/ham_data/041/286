I've received Jim's endorsement of your need for $45,000 to build a
computer-cluster in relation to your grant-supported research.  It is very
helpful.  Now I want to argue with Herb that ALL the money you need should
come from overhead/indirect costs gained from your grants.  Could you
please provide me information about all the indirect costs (income)
received by the University as a result of your grants since 1989?  (I
choose 1989 because it's 10 years ago--a nice round number--and it was my
first year here.)  I would also appreciate receiving a talley of the amount
of specially allotted money that the University has provided (as matching
money or otherwise) in support of your grants or research over the past 10
years.  I am NOT referring to regular budgetary resources, program
improvement items, or anything that I (A&S) might have provided in support
of your grants or research.  I mean: What has Herb (or Lou) provided of an
unusual nature, as special additional support.  In sum, I want to remind
Herb about the net income that the Univesity has received as a result of
your own initiatives.  The sooner you can get these figures to me the
better; I'll pursue this matter right away.  Is there any deadline by which
this matter needs to be resolved?  David
