Another solution to this which is easier but more expensive is to use the
output of the motor driver chip to drive solid state relays.  You need the
relays that use 5 volts for control and that will switch DC.  The relays I use
have flyback diodes in them, but I don't know that all do so a user would need
to add them if they were not included.

Four are needed.
