Keith,

I have a reference for you.  It is "Microcomputer Engineering," 2nd ed. by Gene H.
Miller.  You can get it from one of the online book sellers, like amazon.com.  It
is around $85 or so.

In this text is the whole range of things having to do with assembly language
programming the HC11.  It's detailed and I find it readable.

I agree with you that there is not a lot having to do with programming of elements
deep within the HC11, but there is enough if you *really* dig.  I learned
everything I know, which admittedly isn't much, off the internet, in just a few
texts, and by studying other people's code as you do.  Someday, I may even
understand some of it!
