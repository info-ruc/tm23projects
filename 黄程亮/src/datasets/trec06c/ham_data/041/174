Subject: Smooth PWM for IC3.2?
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi everybody,

I have IC3.2 and want to use the smooth PWM functions.
I've already adapted my lib_hb.c file. If I use the pcode_hb.s19 file
adapted for smooth PWM (downloaded from Fred Martin's site), everything
works ok, only I end up with IC2.8!

Has anybody modified the IC3.2 version of pcode_hb.s19 for using the
smooth PWM functions?

Thanks in advance for your help!
Marc Katz
