Howdy,

My original suggestion was to use *solid state* relays.  They don't have any
contacts.  I use them plugged right into my Rug Warrior board at the motor output
ports (would work the same on my Handy Board, but I have it on a smaller base, and
the L293D is big enough for that).  The relays switch very fast, being solid state.
They are rated at 6 amps at 36 volts, and were $7 each.  Smaller ones are less
expensive, but their main advantage is ease of use.
