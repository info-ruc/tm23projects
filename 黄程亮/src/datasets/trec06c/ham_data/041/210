 I don't know about the servo routines on the HB, but servos *do* start to
jitter when the pulses get much below about 20Hz. This is not due to the
pulse width 'fluctuating', it's because the refresh rate is dropping. It
certainly is possible that the refresh rate drops as the load on the 6811
increases. Perhaps servo control could be offloaded onto a PIC ala. Scott
Edwards SSC (serial servo controller) at:

If you have a PIC programmer (or a BASIC stamp) it's pretty trivial to
program one to accept serial commands and output the pulses to a few
servos. Scott's is nice because it can handle eight servos and there is
*no* jitter.

Hope this helps, Duncan
