Haven't actually tried it, but I was thinking of the same sort of thing.
Use a FET for PWM and a DPDT relay for direction.  practically speaking,
if you only switched the relay when the FET was off, no power
transition, etc....
If your 'bot moves forward more than back than using a default state
(N/C) for the forward motion, means current to the relay is only
consummed during the reverse movement.
A single FET with a relay s(w)hould prove to be quite a bit more space
conservative and likely cost effective as well.
Comments?
