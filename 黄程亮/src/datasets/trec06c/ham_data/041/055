Hi everyone,

I came across some software in the NY Times that looks like its worth
checking out.  Designed by/with Richard Dawkins of all people
(Mr.Memes), it seems to be a game-like environment that combines genetic
algorithms with respond to audio input, designed especially to create
evolving graphics for nightclubs.  Apparently it is getting popular in
London.

There's a website at:

	http://www.dancerdna.com

If it looks interesting, let's purchase a copy for $25.

Also, we rediscovered quite a treasure-trove in our group of musical
games and CD-Roms (including Toshio Iwai's incredible "Musical Insects")
that are really worth a look by anyone interested in anything related to
music or image games or activities.  Come to our area to play, or feel
free to borrow these (returning them, of course).  Since I'll be back
and forth from Houston for the next couple of weeks, contact either Josh
(strickon@media) or Gili (gili@media) if you want to check them out.

Tod
