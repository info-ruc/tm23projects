Subject: Rangingproblems with Sharp GP2D02
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Hi all
I just finished rewriting the GP2D02 routines by Kent.
Seems all to work just fine....except that I don't get readings below
around 55.
Even if I don't have anything in front of the sensor (dist. to wall more
than 2m) I never get a reading of 0.
I don't think I did anything wrong in the software although I had to
completely rewrite the sensor reading part because I need to read 8
sensors at the same time. I'll keep checking my software :))
But if anyone also had the problem of not getting readings of more than
like 40cm please let me know.

Thanks :))))

Tom
