All,

I will be out April 13, frustratingly, as I am especially
eager to help gin up project ideas (with all groups of course,
but with a special focus on the "magnet" and "accelerometer" teams).
I'll ask Bakhtiar and Phil et al to see what we can somehow schedule.
But most important, I'd love to hear a concise status from each
project team so that I can get moving to find additional resources
that might help any of you.

Note that we will have two guests coming up:

April 20: Reinar Knizia (thanks to Matt Gray and Charlotte!)
April 27: Eric Zimmerman (thanks to Mitch!)

Both are renowned game designers.  We are trying to schedule
Steve Meyer and his father (Steve runs Meyer-Glass, and their
firm came up with gems like Lite-Brite, Mousetrap, Rock-em-Sock-em
robots, etc); John Eyler (FAO Schwartz); Chuck Jones (Bugs Bunny);
and Matt Groening (Simpsons; Futurama).

Mike
