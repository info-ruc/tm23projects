I've taken a look at Chuck's LCD code, and I agree that it's the best
  I've come across. 
  
I spent last weekend studying how to program the HB in assembly. 
  There is a woeful lack of documentation for it. There is plenty of
  docs on programming in IC, but below that level, you end up looking
  at schematics. 
  
I do have the Motorola reference books on the 6811, and have no
  problem figuring out how to program the SCI, SPI, the various
  handshake modes, et. al., but figuring out how they relate to the
  various handy board (and especially expansion board) connectors is
  really tough. 

Is there something I've missed that describes how to do low level
  programming on the handyboard?

Just about everything I've figured out how to do came from reading
  other people's code. 

So I've spent some hours lately reading the code other people have
  written for the handyboard and the miniboard. And I really like
  Chuck's libraries. 

BTW, if there's nothing out there that describes low-level programming
  on the handyboard, I'll probably write up my notes on what I've
  learned and make them available so future people don't have to go
  through what I'm going through.
