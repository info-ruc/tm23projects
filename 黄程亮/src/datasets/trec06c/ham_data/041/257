My HB is totally new, and I also have the "jitters".  However, I have never
Zap charged the unit.  Although when we observed the jitters we were
excessievly calling printf()...  We more promenently noticed the jitters when
running 2 9V motors (with smooth PWM code).  The jitters only occures in the
range 20 - 30... You can probably best notice this by using the knob to set
the PWM rate of the motors directly...
