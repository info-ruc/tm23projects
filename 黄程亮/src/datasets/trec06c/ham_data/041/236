As a follow up to my nervous servo, it gets the shakes even when
running as a single process=2E  Ok, I confess=2E=2E=2E I recharged it on ZAP and
fell asleep=2E=2E=2E Is it possible that either the servo or the HB was damaged
by this in such a way as to give it a nervous tick???  Everything else
seems to function okay=2E=2E=2E
