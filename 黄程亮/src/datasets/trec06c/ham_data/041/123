First use TINNIT Bright Tin Plate No. ER18 (cheap and does the job) 
available at Circuit Specialists and Jameco. A better tin plate 
already mixed can be found at JDR Micro Devices. Then use M.G. 
Chemicals Conformal Coating which is a flexible acrylic Lacquer 
available at Circuit Specialists. Used properly, your PCB's can look 
and perform as good as any commercial boards.

Have Fun!
