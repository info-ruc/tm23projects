I doubt that the jitters are from zapping your battery.  I get servo
jitters, too, and I've never zapped my battery.  I saw a suggestion on
the list a while back that it has something to do with interference from
the LCD printf routine.  I plan to avoid the problem (and run lots of
servos at once) by buying one of those multiple servo serial controller
modules, like the kind that the Robot Store in CA sells.
