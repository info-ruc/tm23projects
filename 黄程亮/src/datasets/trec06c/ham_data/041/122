Hello all,

I want to power the handy board using the 250watt 12V  9amp power supply
of a PC.  Any suggestions as to what I should take into consideration
before attempting this. A buffer? A fuse? A straight hook up?  Why is
the HB not supposed to be powered by a regulated power supply? Any input
welcome.

Side note:   The SIMTEK nvSRAM part number STK15C88-W45 was a direct
plug-in, I have found no need to build a power down circuit mentioned
previously in the mailing list.  Having tested all ways of losing power,
memory is retained.
