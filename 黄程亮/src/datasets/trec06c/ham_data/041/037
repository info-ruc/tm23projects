Hi,

I have looked around on the mailing list and have not found anything that
will answer this question....


I have an expansion board and want to use a 12v 2amp source for my motors.
The hack listed in the FAQ is only for use on a handy board only, without
expansion board. I don't want this to interfere adversely with my servo
outputs on the expansion board. Does anyone have any suggestions?

Anyone had any luck with the little hall-effect compass sold by Zagros
Robotics? They didn't send me any data sheet or other info.


Thanks,

Bob Kelly
