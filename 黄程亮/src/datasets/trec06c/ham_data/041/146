Total cost for both, $56.00.  Smaller ones are cheaper.  Again, the advantage is
convenience, not cost.  These pulg right into the motor driver output ports on either
the Handy Board or the Rug Warrior with the L293D left in place, and take no other
components.

I'm doing R&D for my product line, and cost is not a criteria when I try something.
However, getting 6 amps at 36 volts is pretty cheaply done this way if someone was
building a bot needing this kind of power.  For smaller robots, smaller and less
expensive relays could be used, however given the time and knowledge it could be done
for much less using H-Bridges from Allegro or some other source.
