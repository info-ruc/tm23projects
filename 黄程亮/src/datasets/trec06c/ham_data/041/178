Actually, if you have been following this thread, there are several
ideas that have come up, including the solid state relay (reliable, high
current, but SPST, moderate cost ), transistor to up the
current(reliable, mded current, low cost, but SPST), mechanical relay
(requires driver, mod cost, multiple configurations, reliable to 10's of
thousands of cycles.)
