Hi Herb,

As we discussed in our phone conversation, the renewal of our US
Department of Energy grant was approved, but we did not get additional
funds ($75,000) that we requested for a computer cluster to support our
research at Jefferson Lab. However, we did get permission from DOE to
use funds (about $30,000) that we have left over in our current funding
period budget toward the purchase of the computer cluster. We are
requesting matching funds from the University for the computer cluster.
We believe this is a reasonable request considering that this grant has
brought in over $250,000 in indirect costs over the last 11 years, and
will bring in another $66,240 in the next 3 years. The computer cluster
and the work we do using it will constitute our service contribution to
the CLAS Collaboration in Hall B at Jefferson Lab. Our participation in
this collaboration has been an important factor in our ability to
maintain this research grant. The computer cluster will also provide
modern technology training for our students and make us competitive with
our collaborators at places like ODU and UVa.

We have sent more detailed information about this to you in the mail.

Thanks for working with us on this.

Mike Vineyard
