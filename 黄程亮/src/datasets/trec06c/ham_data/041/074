khi, i;d like to pass the following idea around here to
see what you guys think.

the idea is to use the same clock for an array of several
(say 6) of the sharp sensors. the idea is to wait
until all of them are responded that are ready to go
and then clock the data off all of them simultaneously.

this would save us basically 5 output pins, if
we can use only one ... and probably save us
from having to use mutiplexors, since we may have 7
available ports (bot not 12).

has anyone tried this before. will it work with
each and everyone of them having a diode in series?

thanks,

-c
