Drew-

I have a Handy Board on a robot that runs three servos and the GP2D02 sensor,
and I have the same nervous jitters problem.  However, I do not run any
processes on this application.  I am using IC under v 3.2 of the software, so
I could use processes but didn't.  Look around on the site at
http://www.acroname.com and find "Scooter Dude" in the gallery if you want to
see what the application is

I also have a Rug Warrior board powering a different robot, and it uses a
servo to aim a sonar mast.  I do see the effects of running processes on that
in that the servo jumps from place to place, whereas when running the servo
absent any other processes it runs smoothly.  BUT it does not "jitter" like
the Handy Board servos.

I haven't dug into it yet, but there is obviously something fundamentally
different about the way the Handy Board drives servos compared to the way the
Rug Warrior does it.  Because this is the case, I am not sure that allocating
more run time for the servo process is going to fix it, but it is easy enough
to try.  After that, an intense study of the implementation technique on the
Handy Board is in order.  Let me know if you get time to look into that, and
I'm sure others will be interested as well.  One possible band-aide would be
to de-initialize the servos between each finite change in their command
state.  That stops them from jittering because they are powered down.
