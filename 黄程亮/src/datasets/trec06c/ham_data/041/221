All,

Apparently the MIT calendar has nipped us yet again: April 20
is technically the "day after Patriot's Day" holiday.  We'd like
to have class anyway.  More than that, Reiner Knizia, game designer,
will be here to speak on his products and methods from 4-5.
Please make a note of it.

thanks,
Mike
