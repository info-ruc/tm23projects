>Most music heard by most people most of the time is recorded, yet most

>aspects of piano sound are important for the meaning of the music and
>how the piano should be recorded so that listeners to the recording will
>
>have a chance to experience the original performance legitimately. He
>also discusses the performer's responsibility: Is it only for what he or

>she *does*? Or is it for what arrives at the listener's ears? A question
>
>and answer period will follow.
