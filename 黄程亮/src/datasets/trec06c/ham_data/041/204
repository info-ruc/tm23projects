I'm looking at the Sharp data sheet, and they have a chart that shows
decimal distance measuring output vs distance to object in centimeters, and
they indicate the minimum reading to be around decimal 59 to 64 depending
on object reflectivity.  That says to me that you will never have a 0
return as long as the sensor is working.

Good luck,
