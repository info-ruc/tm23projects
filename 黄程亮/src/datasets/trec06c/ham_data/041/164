Hi,
Anyone know where I can purchase a commercial unit that I can operate
automobile starter type relays from the COMOS outputs on the handyboard
expansion board? only 5 mA per output.
Or would it be eaiser to fabricate? I don't want to damage the
outputs.
					Thanks in advance
					Terry  P. Gathright
