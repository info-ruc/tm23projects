For next week's session (April 13), we will divide time between:

(1) Discussion of "styles of play". Last week, we handed out two papers on
this
topic, one by Turkle/Papert, the other by Shotwell/Wolf/Gardner. If you=
 didn't
get copies of these papers, you can pick them up from Carolyn in 020A
(stoeber@media.mit.edu). In our in-class discussion, we will try to relate=
 the
issues in these papers to the class projects.

(2) Status reports on class projects. It would be great if groups could show
early/partial prototypes and discuss specific design issues.

----------

As mentioned in class, game designer Eric Zimmerman will be visiting the=
 Media
Lab on April 27. We have arranged for him to make a presentation at 4:00 pm,
directly after class. Below is Eric's bio, along with a brief description of
what he plans to discuss in his presentation...

>Despite the proliferation of games in the world today, game design has yet=
 to
establish a critical discourse in the way that architecture, graphic design,
and other design disciplines have. Building from historical definitions of

constructed objects along formal, social, and cultural axes. I will also=
 share
some of my own game design work in the computer and paper realms.=20
