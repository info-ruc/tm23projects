Subject: HB encoders question
Message-Id: <Pine.SUN.3.90.990406030830.6445B-100000@magnum.cooper.edu>

Can the HB measure encoder pulses faster than 1 kHz?
(this is the speed of the system interrupt)

Assume we have an encoder that does 500 pulses per revolution.
What happens when we exceed 2 revolutions per second?
What happens if the encoder has two channels (quadrature) and we exceed 1 
revolution per second?

Is there a way to reduce the pulse rate of an encoder?

Any input would be greatly appreciated.
