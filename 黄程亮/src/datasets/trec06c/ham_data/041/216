Hi Doc,

The function call "init_expbd_servos(0);" turns them off, "init_expbd_servos(1);"
turns them on.  Something like "servo5=2300;" commands a servo to a position, but
only if the servos are initialized as per above.  Maybe I used a confusing term
when I said de-initialize.

Now, let me get this straight....  Medical Director?  Maybe I can work with you
on a robot that will remove any undifferentiated glial cells from in vitro
cultures once we figure out how to get pluripotent stem cells to differentiate in
this way.  The pluripotent cells are tumorgenic, as you know, so we have to be
careful to get 'em all differentiated, or get them out of the culture before
inplant into the substantia nigra.  What do you think?

Or, maybe I just stick with picking up Coke cans :-)

Best regards,

Gary Livick
