>So you are saying that only

as it says in the docs:

  init_expbd_servos(int action) 
  If action is zero, servo control signals are disabled. 
  If action is non-zero, servo control signals are enabled. 
  Control signals are disabled by default every time the Handy Board is 
reset. 

so in other words, yes.
