Hey,

	Two weeks before we present our project and the HandyBoard got fried!!!
Ahhh!   Oh well, hopefully someone can help us identify the problem.  The
board seems to work fine as long as its getting power through the RS-232
connection.  Once this is disconnected, we lose all power.  We checked the
fuse (F1), seems to be fine.  We replaced the voltage regulator and that
didn't help.  Please, any suggestions??????

Thanks
