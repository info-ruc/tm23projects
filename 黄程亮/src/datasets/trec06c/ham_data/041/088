Curt, may I suggest that rather than re-invent the wheel you take the LCD
code out of the Handyboard libraries I wrote that are on the icc11 site.
They should pretty much compile out of the box and I know they work :-)
They are also about 75% more efficient than the IC version as they don't
spend anytime busy waiting on the LCD (this really helps multiple servo
performance!) The interface isn't exactly the same as IC (there are things
like cursor positioning routines and support for other LCD sizes) but they
are useful.
