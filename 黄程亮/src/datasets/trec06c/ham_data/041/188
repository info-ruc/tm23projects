I added his patch into my patch and it is now available for download:

	ftp.eskimo.com/u/a/archer/hc11-patch-latest.tar.gz

I've also updated the readme to include the latest copyright information

to the install procedure by Keith Hearns and some fixes by myself.

Note that if you already snagged the earlier patch, then just do the
modification to the one file as described in my last message.  You may
still want to go snag the readme from my ftp site though, as it has
additional details and some fixes.  It's available separately from the
.tar.gz file.
