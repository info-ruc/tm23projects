Hi all,

I am planning on giving a short MAX tutorial this Friday (April 9th)
11:00AM.
MAX is a graphical programming environment which is especially good for
quick prototyping of MIDI, DSP and some graphics based applications. You may
find Max to be a creative tool in a 5-weeks-for-a-working-demo situation.

If you are planning on coming, please let me know so I can prepare enough
room with enough space for you all. (I will probably do it in my office -
E15-491 - if there are less than 5 participants).

Gili
