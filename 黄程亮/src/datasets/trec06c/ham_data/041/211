Hi,

If you haven't yet picked up the readings for class tomorrow, you can find
them in the Cube, against the wall outside Mitchel's office, in the top
three shelves of the little blue papers rack.

They are:

----
Turkle and Papert. "Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the
Concrete." Journal of Mathematical Behavior 11, 3-33 (1992).

Shotwell, Wolf and Gardner. "Exploring Early Symbolization: Styles of
Achevement" in _Play and Learning_, ed. Sutton-Smith. (1979)

----

These two articles will serve as a foundation for discussing individual
differences in modes of play and learning. Please come equipped with your
own nostalgic memories of stylistically-polarized childhood play, for the
rest of us to mercilessly deconstruct. 

Kwin
