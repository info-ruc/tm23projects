I took the assembly routine out of the ICC11 library and adapted it
slightly for GCC (input/output params mostly).  I had to split up the
assembly and C-code portions into separate files, and have the
lcd.h/lcd.c/lcdasm.s files ported and working, but haven't finished with
lcdio.h. Gotta sleep sometime. 

After I converted everything in lcd.c over to pointer-based access, the
code got smaller and probably a lot faster as well.  I'll go back and try
to optimize everything for speed later though once it is stable.

One friend I showed the code to said "Wow!  I didn't know anybody ever
actually read in the busy bit... I'm impressed!".  He's done a lot of LCD
stuff, and that's the first code he had seen that read anything from the
LCD module.

Thanks again for letting me use the code.  Saved me probably weeks of
effort.
