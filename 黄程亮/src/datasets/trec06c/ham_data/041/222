I'd go for the Coke can idea.  Sounds like a surer shot.

I thought init_expbd_servos(x), where x = integer from 0 to 5, was used 
to initialize the servos individually.  Stupid me.  I've been using 
init_expbd_servos(5), and, since I only had #5 hooked up, and it 
centered, I propagated my own misconception.  So you are saying that only 
0 and 1 are valid arguments for the init_expbd_servos() funcion?
