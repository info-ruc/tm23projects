ok, so P6305-ND is the part i originally specified.  sure enough, you 
can't find it online. but i found it in the latest print digikey catalog! 
 (i didn't check that it was the same until after i sent my msg.)

now, P5417-ND (also in the latest catalog) doesn't come up either.

so i got on the phone and talked to digikey.  they're discontinuing the 
Panasonic brand caps and replacing them with Philips.  These are on pages 
281-284 of the Apr-Jun 99 catalog.

a suitable replacement for the part in question from the Philips line is

  4000PHCT-ND

this should be a superior part to the Panasonic -- it's smaller and 
cheaper with the same electrical specs.
