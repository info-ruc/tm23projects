The problem I have isn't programming the HC11. I picked that up with
  no problem by spending a day reading Motorola's reference manual
  (AKA the pink book - kindly provide free by Motorola via their web page).
  I've got a software background, and while my assembly experience is
  limited, it's just yet another language. And the pink book is fairly
  clear on what you have to write where to make the values you want go
  to the pins you want (or come from the pins you want).

My problem is figuring out how the HC11 is used in the HB. Sure, I
  know that after doing an A-D conversion I can read the input from
  one of the ADR* registers, but how (other than reading other
  people's code) am I supposed to figure out that I have to first write
  001 into the high three bits of 0x4000 if I want to read from analog
  ports 25-31? 
  
Where can I find out what pins connect through which mux to which 
  I/O connector on the HB?

And how on earth is anyone supposed to figure out how the LCD
  communications work without reading other people's code? I've read
  other people's code, I've read the pink book, I now understand how 
  it works (yee gads! it's scary). But there's no way you'd ever figure
  it out just from reading HC11-specific info. And you'd have to have
  a degree in digital electronics to figure it out from the
  schematics.

That sort of this is very specific to the handyboard design, not to
  the HC11.
