Kelley,

   Hey, how're things going for you up at Astro? - fine, I hope.  BTW,
I've gone into business for myself and am currently working 50% time
for the Gravity Probe B mission at Stanford.  Their systems guy is
named Jeff Wade -- he's a good guy and reminds me of you in many ways.
He's very security consious and has set up what looks like a solid
and robust ops network.  I was wondering if you'd be willing to talk
with Jeff on the phone.  I suggested that he talk to you about the
various systems processes we used on EUVE: security, ECOs, etc.  Let
me know what you think.  Thanks ...

		Brett
