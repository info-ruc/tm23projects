Actually, I beleive URW only did the instructing (aka hinting) for
these fonts.  B&H own the TM and the C on the outlines.  Also, the
XLFD for those fonts has b&h as the vendor.

So it should be h.... rather than u.... for the Berry names.

BTW, the metrics for Luxi were intended AIUI to closely match a
certain set of popular fonts¹ but more legible on screen.
