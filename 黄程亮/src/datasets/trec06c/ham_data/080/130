Subject: New font Web site
Message-ID: <CMM.0.92.0.1017680130.beebe@suncore.math.utah.edu>

Some of you may be interested in visiting this Web site, whose
existence was brought to my attention by a posting on the unicode list
this morning:

	http://www.fontcraft.com/

Don't be put off by the initial page, which shows pictures of a
different kind of font: instead, follow the links from the selection
button at the upper right, e.g., to some very nice color displays of
fonts from the Book of Kells (in the library at Trinity College in
Dublin, Ireland: I certainly enjoyed our visit there several years
ago).
