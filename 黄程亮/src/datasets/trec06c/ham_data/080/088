cause confusion or offence)

<goes away to boil head>  Oh dear.  It does, doesn't it?  And it was me,
not Alan, who added that bit.  You realise you just lost a wonderful
opportunity to say `RTFM' to the idiot who WTFM?

Righto.  Hmm.  I see - so by default, fontinst looks for the `narrow'
varient for the NFSS specifier `condensed'.  Not that daft, but (as you
point out) something that needs documenting.

Hmm.  A thought: would it make sense to have \latinfamily look for n *and*
c for `condensed' by default?  And if so, does fontinst allow this?

<chuckle>  Quite possibly...  My head's on a little straighter than it was
and now I've got a 400MHz G4 superseding my old 25MHz 68LC040, I can do
trial fontinst runs without having to make a cup of tea.  There's a
fighting chance I'll kick the fontinst manual in to better shape before the
end of the year.  And I might even read the bloody thing some day, eh? ;-)

(for those who might be curious, I've got vast piles of notes about
fontinst's operation, and these latest replies are being shoved there.
What I need to do is play around some more and get a few more things about
fontinst straight in my mind and *then* I can maybe re-write the manual
some more; my hope is that all this help you've given *me* can be `saved
for posterity' in a coherent manual.  If my flaky brain lets me finish it,
that is.  I'm still very unreliable, I'm afraid.)

With the \installfamily commands added, it most certainly does.

Ah - yes, that makes sense.  What happened here was a mistake I made some
years ago has propagated down the line to now.  Well, I'm learning, and
fontinst is beginning to make some sort of sense to me.

But it does need one extra, as pointed out by Lars Hellström (and as I used
to know - mind like a sieve, me):

>You have to say

>\installfamily{T1}{pun}{}
>\installfamily{OT1}{pun}{}

And *then* it all works properly.

Thanks very much to both Lars and Walter,
Rowland.
