Hi,

I thought some of you might be interested in the following announcement
about the latest issue of RBS' Currents, which focuses on Lesson Study.

Thanks.

~~~ Lesson Study in Spotlight of "RBS Currents"~~~
http://www.rbs.org/currents/0502/index.shtml
Online now is the spring issue of RBS Currents, which covers the
professional development method called "lesson study" and its
practice in the Mid-Atlantic region. We think it deserves your
attention and your valuable time. Practitioners find that lesson
study effectively connects theory with classroom practice,
improves teachers' focus on student thinking and learning, and
builds collaborative efforts among staff rather than imposing
"top-down" professional development. Sound too good to be true?
Start finding out with the lead article "What is Lesson Study?,"
and then jump into the others highlighted below.

   ~ Lesson Study: It's a Matter of Time ~
http://www.rbs.org/currents/0502/matter_of_time.shtml
Public School 2 in Paterson, NJ is known for pioneering lesson
study in the United States. Read Principal Lynn Liptak's views
on lesson study and learn about the ways in which she makes time
in the school schedule to support lesson study activities.

   ~ Knowledgeable Others Collaborate in Lesson Study ~
http://www.rbs.org/currents/0502/knowledgeable_others.shtml
Lesson study is not only about teachers collaborating with one
another. It is also about increasing teachers' content knowledge
in mathematics and science. By collaborating with knowledgeable
others, such as mathematics educators from a nearby university,
teachers get more comfortable with content knowledge and
university educators keep in touch with classroom practice.

   ~ Lesson Study Photo Gallery ~
http://www.rbs.org/currents/0502/essay.shtml
Tour this gallery and you'll see how lesson study is an active
professional development model that engages teachers and
administrators in collaboratively writing, observing, and
discussing lessons.

   ~ Looking at our Blackboards ~
http://www.rbs.org/currents/0502/effective_use_of_blackboard.shtml
Can an organized blackboard help to organize and focus student
thinking? In Japan, lesson study discussions have examined how a
carefully planned blackboard presentation can help organize
student thinking and promote understanding. This article by
Makoto Yoshida discusses the importance of an area often
ignored: blackboard organization.

   ~ Lesson Study Resources ~
http://www.rbs.org/lesson_study/readings_and_resources.shtml
As lesson study sparks interest in the U.S., more and more
resources are becoming available to support schools that are
exploring it. Visit the Lesson Study Readings and Resources page
on the RBS Web site for an up-to-date listing of organizations,
research articles, and multimedia products relating to lesson
study.


~~~ Valuable Institute for Urban Educators in PA ~~~
http://www.pa-academy.org/gua/index.html
Time is running out to apply for the impressive Governor's
Academy for Urban Education, to be held at Muhlenberg College in
Allentown, PA, June 23-28. Geared toward K-8 educators, the
Academy focuses on developing Teaching and Learning Improvement
Plans, aligning curricula with PA standards, and working with
issues facing urban schools. Successful participants will earn
graduate credits, which may be applied to Act 48 recertification
requirements.


~~~ Last Chance to Catch Our IMAGES ~~~
http://www.rbs.org/mathsci/states/pa/images.shtml
Are you excited about mathematics education? IMAGES institutes,
geared to tackling the challenges of teaching elementary
geometry and measurement, are being offered in eastern, central,
and western PA this summer (open to all). The extended
registration deadline means that you can still sign up for this
unique offering from the Mid-Atlantic Eisenhower Consortium.
Visit the Web page above for locations, dates, costs, and Act 48
credit information.


~~~ Free from RBS: "Northwest Teacher" on Lesson Study ~~~
http://www.rbs.org/news/20010720a.shtml
Northwest Teacher's issue entitled "Lesson Study: Teachers
Learning Together" provides a vivid explanation of the lesson
study process and features stories on the schools and districts
around the country that are implementing lesson study. Mid-
Atlantic residents can request the issue for free.

To request this and other free mathematics and science
resources, visit the "Free Publications and Multimedia
Resources" page on the Mid-Atlantic Eisenhower Consortium's Web
site at http://www.rbs.org/mathsci/free_pubs/.
