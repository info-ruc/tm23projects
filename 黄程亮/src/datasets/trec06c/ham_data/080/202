Lesson study colleagues,

I am working with an elementary school teacher in Japan to publish a
booklet that a school district has made that contains some "lessons"
that have been taught and discussed among other teachers. I want to
translate this into
English and make it available for teachers in the US to see more ideas
about teaching and thinking about teaching in Japan. Does anyone know
about a company or organization that might publish this final product?
