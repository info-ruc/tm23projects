Possibly, but it's interesting data.  In Adobe.map-by-name, there's:

phvr8rn   Helvetica-Narrow                  0.5 hvn_____
phvr8rc   Helvetica-Condensed               014 hvc_____

Clearly some founts are designed in both narrow and condensed versions.
I'm not sure whether any of this gets anyone anywhere, but there you go.

Rowland.
