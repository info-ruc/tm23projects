Subject: Re: PSNFSS version 9 -- test release

Hi,

in addition to v9b1.zip, I have provided a further archive 
file now.  The ZIP archive

 <http://home.vr-web.de/was/psnfss-beta/v9b2.zip>

includes the updated documentation and some other files, 
that have changed over PSNFSS 8.2.  The contents of v9b1.zip 
is still entirely valid.

Thus, v9b1.zip and v9b2.zip together include *everything*
needed to update PSNFSS to version 9 (except for the final 
installation instructions, file 00readme.txt.  

NB:  This is a pre-release, and I do not promise that it is 
already stable.  All I can say, is, that I did not receive 
any complaints so far.

What's new?

tex/latex/psnfss/*.sty
source/latex/psnfss/psfonts.dtx 
  The undocumented command \ppljeuro has been removed 
  from mathpazo.sty.  All .sty files show the new
  version number 9..0.

doc/latex/psnfss/psnfss2e.pdf
source/latex/psnfss/psnfss2e.tex
  Updated and slightly improved documentation.


best wishes

Walter Schmidt
