Subject: Re: PSNFSS version 9 -- test release

Hi,

there has been one more change to the test release of PSNFSS
version 9:  I finally managed to implement a decent \hbar
symbol for the mathptmx.sty package.  Many apologies for
this last-minute change, but I think that the fix is quite
useful.  (Credits to FMi -- the new code is "borrowed" from
his mathtime.sty!)

Furthermore, the ready-made documentation psnfss2e.pdf comes
with all fonts embedded now, so that the font samples will
always show the intended result.

There is a new archive file v9b3.zip in the directory

  <http://home.vr-web.de/was/psnfss-beta/>

which includes all files that have changed over v8.2.  
Please, read the file readme.1st, too.

best wishes

Walter Schmidt
