The first instance of `T1' refers to the file t1.etx;
on a non-Unix system, the case does certainly not matter here.

I'm not even sure whether uc/lc matters, as to the *second*
instance of `T1'.  I just suspected that this might have been 
the source of your problem, because I did not realize that you 
had forgotten the \installfamily commands altogether.  I just 
thought that you forgot to include them in your message.
