Does anyone have any thoughts on berry names for fonts with multiple
named design sizes, where each design is recommended for a certain
range of point sizes, but the specific design point size is not
specified?

Options include a mean (arith, geo, higher order?) of the recommended
range, the median of that range, an alpha abbreviation of the design
name, ....

(An example is Adobe's otf opticals with Caption, '', Subhead and
Display designs.)
