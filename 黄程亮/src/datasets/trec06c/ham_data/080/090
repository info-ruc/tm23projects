Now here's a thing.  I've just looked at the log file kicked out by
fontinst 1.801 in response to a \latinfamily command.  It's full of lines
like:

\installfont <punl8t><punl8r,latin><T1><T1><pun><l><n>

If that first instance of `T1' ought to be `t1', might it be an idea to
change what fontinst prints?

And while I'm nit-picking: might it be an idea to change the output to
indicate the contents of the last argument to the \installfont (and
\installrawfont} command?  Even if that argument is empty, I reckon it's
worth doing to avoid confusing people (it just got me confused, y'see).

(beginning to understand how he got so confused about all this in the first
place, and having spotted another stupidity in the original problem example
he gave.  Well, making your own mistakes is the best way of learning.  I
must be learning *loads*)
