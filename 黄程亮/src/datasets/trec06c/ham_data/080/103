I have been a teacher-on-loan for the Delaware Department of Education since 
August of 2000. My special project has been lesson study. At the end of this 
school year I will be returning to my district to become a classroom teacher 
again. In anticipation of this transition, I have planned a meeting in April 
at which time all of the "players" in Delaware (and some invited guests) will 
develop a plan for the continuation of lesson study services, e.g. 
presentations, training, planning sessions, to Delaware teachers when I am no 
longer working at the Department. I would like to hear any suggestions that 
would be helpful for our discussion. Thanks!
