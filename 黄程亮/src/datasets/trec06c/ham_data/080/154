Subject: Re: "fontname" codes for the Luxi fonts

    l7 LuxiSerif
    l8 LuxiSans
    l9 LuxiMono

Sounds good to me.  And it's great that the fonts are available.

I changed typeface.map (http://tug.org/fontname/typeface.map).

    [ BTW, we are almost running out of codes with the letter "l" now! ]

We already ran out of s's ...

Thanks,
