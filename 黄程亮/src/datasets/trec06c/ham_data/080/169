Dear Sir/Madam,

We are a family that need help from you, we are from Zimbabwe the south of
Africa and we are farmers but we are having a very big problems with the
President Mr. Robert Mugabe because my husband said that what he is doing to
the white farmers is bad by sizing there farmlands and there personal
belonging and also sending his mobs and aids to destroy there property.  

My husband was killed by his aids and they confisticated all our property
so me and my two children had to ran to Chad a small country were we did not
know anybody for safety were we are now seeking asylum, but the help we need
from you is to help us claim the sum of nineteen million dollars
(19,000,000.00 dollars) that my husband left or deposited in a finance house
before his untimely death. 

We cannot go and make the claim and if we try the President have people all
over that will know and they will seize the funds, so I , Mrs. Shima is
writing to you in person after I saw your banking experience and as a big
brother nation to help us and claim this fund you can stand as a partner to
my late husband and send to the finance house an application for claim or
retransfer of the funds to your account  and you will have 30% of the total
amount and if  you like invest our share in your country but  it's very  
important you help us to come over to your great country.

Please forward to me your telephone/fax number and contact address to my
confidential email address: euniceshima@excite.com , for security reason.

Thank you and God bless us all. 

Yours sincerely,

Mrs. U. Shima
