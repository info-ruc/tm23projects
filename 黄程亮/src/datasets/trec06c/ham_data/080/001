We have a group of teachers and administraters who have been to Greenwich and Patterson, NJ to get lesson study going in the district.  Ten of our group members also traveled to Japan last summer for a month with Michigan State University to see their schools and how lesson study is actually done there.

Our group would like to know if anyone has video accessing for Lesson Study.  We have been working on Lesson Study and we would like to join in with others through distance learning if possible.  We also need help finding funding for Lesson Study.  Any suggestions or ways that you have done it is much appreciated.

Thank you,
