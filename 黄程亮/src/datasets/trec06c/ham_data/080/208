Subject: PSNFSS version 9 -- test release

Hi,

a pre-release of PSNFSS version 9 is available for public 
testing:

  <http://home.vr-web.de/was/psnfss-beta/v9b1.zip>

Comments are welcome!  
Please, reply to the tex-fonts mailing list, if possible.

The ZIP archive v9b1.zip includes all files, that have been
changed over release 8.2.  The archive is arranged in a
TDS-compliant manner, so that it can be unpacked immediately
in the texmf directory.  Note that the existing font map
files are unchanged.  

*
* Install this archive over the current release 8.2 only!
* Do NOT install over version 8.1 or 7.x!
*
* The archive includes an updated file dvips/psnfss/8r.enc.
* Please, make sure that there is not further (obsolete) 
* copy of 8r.enc in any other directory below texmf/dvips !
*

What's new?

dvips/psnfss/8r.enc
vtex/enc/8r.enc
  The TeXBase1Encoding includes the Euro symbol in slot 128
  now.  Thus, future fonts, which provide the Euro, can be
  supported.  This does, however, NOT affect the present
  Base35, Charter and Utopia fonts.  
  See the recent discussion on the tex-fonts mailing list 
  with the subject "successor to TeXBase1Encoding with /Euro".
  The related 8r.etx file for use with fontinst is available 
  separately:
  <http://home.vr-web.de/was/psnfss-beta/8r.etx>.

  Pazo math fonts (by Diego Puga):
  The Pazo Blackboard Bold math alphabet provides all
  uppercase letters and the digit 1 now.
  The shapes of the letters \Phi and \varsigma were
  improved.  In consequence, the letters \xi and \zeta
  changed, too.  Note that the metrics of the \Phi have
  changed, so there is actually a slight incompatibility
  with the previous release.
  
fonts/tfm/adobe/palatino/ppl*8c.tfm
fonts/vf/adobe/palatino/ppl*8c.vf
  Palatino text fonts:
  The textcompanion fonts of the Palatino family provide the
  Euro symbol \texteuro as well as the Omega \textohm now.
  The letters are actually taken from the Pazo fonts.
  Despite the changed font metrics, there should be no
  problems with existing documents, which do not use these
  symbols.  Note that this has nothing to do with the
  changed 8r.enc!

happy TeXing

Walter Schmidt
