Hi people,

Based on the various replies you kindly supplied me, I have
decided to drop the sans serif fonts out of my document. I am currently
writing my thesis and only use serif and a typewriter font now out of
necessity (i write plain text & source code).

I have selected the Adobe Garamond series as my main font (partly
because I have the expert fonts, and those ligatures are just
beautiful :). As typewriter font I use cmtt, as I recently heard
(right here? or at comp.text.tex?) that this font mixes well with
almost any font.. (any alternative typewriter/fixed-width fonts
for AGaramond?)

Also, I have ordered The elements of Typographic Style by Bringhurst.
I am really getting interested in font & design stuff. Hints,
links, tips anyone?

See you,
--
