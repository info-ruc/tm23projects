I know Karl did trojan work for TeX
in keeping the web2c flame alight for many years.
But isn't the Berry naming scheme really obsolete?

To start with, surely DOS has gone, and with it
the idea of compressing file-names to 8 characters.

My feeling, from reading comp.text.tex,
is that the Berry font naming system
is one of those things that LaTeX newbies
find very off-putting.
