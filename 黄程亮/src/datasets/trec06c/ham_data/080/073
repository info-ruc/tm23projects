So, I thought I would start out the linuxusers
email list by letting everyone know what it is
about.  First, it is meant to be an forum to 
allow those of us that use linux/administer linux
to exchange questions/answers/suggestions amongst
each other.  Second, I plan on posting information
about security updates (mainly the CERT Advisories)
to it with emphasis on linux issues...to help
you protect your linux machines better.  There 
may be other catagories later on, but this is a good
start.

Issue 1.

PAST CERT Advisories:

I would direct everyone to the web site that deals with
this and suggest everyone read through the last advisories
concerning Unix (say for the past two years or so).  It
would be a good idea to verify on your machines at
home and laptops, etc, that these have been dealt with
satisfactorily.  The URL for CERT is www.cert.org.
You might also want to get put on the mailing lists
for CERT Advisories here...it usually gives you a 
day notice before something bad happens (you might
even be able to prevent it from happening).

Issue 2.

Helpful web site for Linux users:

One of the most helpful sites for setting up and configuring
your linux system is http://linuxdoc.org/ and its
mirror sites.  From here you can branch out to lots of 
other useful sites.

Issue 3.

Department resources...we have CDs/DVD media with 
RedHat 7.2, 7.1, Suse 7.3, and Debian (whatever the
latest release is) on them.  Some of these are my 
own personal copies, so please take care of them
should you borrow them.  We won't, at present, provide
more than cursory support for installing and configuring
them...at some time in the future, when we have more
staff available to do it, we may provide more robust
support.

Issue 4.

Always a good idea to look for things in the comp.os.linux
newsgroups.  If you have never used USENET news, the campus
NNTP server is agate.berkeley.edu and you might subscribe to
several if not all of the groups under the comp.os.linux catagory.
Also, groups.google.com is helpful for archived news postings.
