it's somewhat too black, but its low x-height and good design makes it a
good choice, yes.  For quite obvious reasons, there is no tt font that
reasonably mix with AGaramond (I personnally use Letter Gothic, but this
may need to be reworked a bit in order to live on a page with
garaldes..)

good starting point.

Well, there is the home page of Luc Devroye, which is quite a good
gateway to font resources. Charles Hedrick has somewhere something about
design of technical docs. Very conservative.
