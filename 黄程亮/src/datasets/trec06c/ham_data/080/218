Subject: Re: Optical size in fontname

   But isn't the Berry naming scheme really obsolete?

It was close to obsolete when I invented it 10 years ago :).

In Web2c, I distributed font mapping files that made it possible to use
the PostScript FontName of the fonts (the logical alternative, IMHO).  I
don't think they've ever caught on, though.

Do the standard LaTeX packages use other names to search for fonts?
Until that happens, I doubt any other naming scheme can make headway.

As for DOS -- people do still use it.
