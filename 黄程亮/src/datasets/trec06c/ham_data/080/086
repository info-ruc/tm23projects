In the fontinst v1.8 manual (by Alan Jeffrey and Rowland McDonnell [sic!]),
it says:

  If you would like to be on the
  \texttt{fontinst} mailing list, please mail
  \url{fontinst-request@cogs.susx.ac.uk}.

Mind you, posting on this list is not restricted to the list subscribers,
so you could just as well have posted your question there.

Looking for c widths is commented out in the definition of \latin_widths. I
have no idea why; the last person who changed anything in that code was
Ulrik Vieth.

You have to say

\installfamily{T1}{pun}{}
\installfamily{OT1}{pun}{}

Good point! I'll see what I can do about it.
