What about just makeing a modes.mf entry with a larger darker than
that used by default for the given printer?  Ie, change ljet4 from:

mode_def ljfour =  %\[ HP LaserJet 4 (600dpi)
  mode_param (pixels_per_inch, 600);
  mode_param (blacker, .25);
  mode_param (fillin, 0);
  mode_param (o_correction, 1);
  mode_common_setup_;
enddef;

to something like:

mode_def blackerljfour =  %\[ HP LaserJet 4 (600dpi) with extra blacker
  mode_param (pixels_per_inch, 600);
  mode_param (blacker, 1);
  mode_param (fillin, 0);
  mode_param (o_correction, 1);
  mode_common_setup_;
enddef;

Perhaps also the printer you are using and the 600dpi mode do not
concur.  There are fifteen 600dpi modes in modes.mf, you might prefer
one of the others to whichever one your setup defaults to.
