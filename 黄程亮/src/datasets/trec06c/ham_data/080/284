I'm going to ignore questions of design here, and assume that you have
found serif and sans-serif fonts that would go well together if the sans
were scaled down a bit.  It's up to you to choose wisely and use wisely.

You can modify the .fd files in a nondestructive way.  Look at the files
helvet.sty and ot1phv.fd in the directory texmf/tex/latex/psnfss.  The
package helvet now takes an option [scaled=0.92], and defines \Hv@scale
to be that scale factor.  (And [scaled] is equivalent to
[scaled=0.95].)  Then the .fd files check to see if \Hv@scale is
defined, and if it is, scale the font accordingly.  You could make your
own package file for, say, Gill Sans (note that the name "gillsans" is
already taken) and model it after helvet.sty, changing the names of
macros that appear to refer to Helvetica.  Edit your .fd files to work
like ot1phv.fd too.

Then you would put into your main LaTeX file
\usepackage{mycaslon}
\usepackage[scaled=0.91]{mygill}

but of course you would use fonts that matched.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility.

Would an experienced voice care to suggest some families that work
together but weren't designed with each other in mind?
