Dear lesson study colleagues, I am looking for the following information:
	in your school, district, etc. 
	1) how widespread is lesson study?
	1) how often has it been, or is it being done?
	2) at what grade levels?
	3) in what subjects?

I am writing an article for ASCD and need some real statistics.  Any help you 
can provide would be appreciated.  Thanks!
