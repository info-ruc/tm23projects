Send an email to <fontinst-request@cogs.susx.ac.uk>;
it will be read by a human.

\latinfamily wants condensed variants to be designated by "n",
as opposed to "c", until you put the following into fontinst.rc:

\def\latin_widths{
   \latin_width{}{}
%   \latin_width{n}{c}
   \latin_width{c}{c}
   \latin_width{x}{x}}

Maybe this should be documented in the fontinst guide :-)

Maybe this works:

    \installfont{punr8tc}{punr8rc,latin}{t1}{T1}{pun}{mc}{n}{}

I.e., the name of the encoding (T1) should be uppercased, matching
the \installfamily command, whereas the name of the related t1.etx 
file should be lowercase  (the latter being relevant on Unix systems 
only).
