Excellent advice!

For those curious about the Lucida family, I host a brief .txt file on
it written by Dr. Bigelow and Ms. Holmes (MS had it up back when they
did the MS TrueType Font Pack Vol. 1, but it's since dissappeared from
their ftp site, 'least-wise I can't find it) on my personal web pages at
http://members.aol.com/willadams --- listed in the bibliography.

Y&Y is the canonical vendor for such fonts, www.yandy.com

There has been some effort in for example psnfss to harmonize disparate
fonts though, so one might study such packages to one's benefit.
