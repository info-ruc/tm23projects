It matters! In the end it will all become the names of the fontdef tokens
that LaTeX uses to switch fonts, and \T1/pun/m/n/10 is not the same token
as \t1/pun/m/n/10. What would happen is that LaTeX would input t1pun.fd,
hoping to get some font T1/pun/... defined, but that the file would instead
define t1/pun/... The end result would probably be that LaTeX uses
T1/cmr/m/n instead.
