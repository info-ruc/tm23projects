Given the old (and not that well motivated) TeX/MF tradition of taking the
design sizes of fonts from a geometric progression (that is given some
support by the choice of sizes for which there are standard LaTeX
size-changing commands), I would suspect that the least confusing method is
to take as "design size" the geometric mean of the endpoints of the ranges,
rounded to the nearest integer. For a 8--13pt font this would give a
"design size" of 10, since $\sqrt{8 \cdot 13} \approx 10.2$. On the other
hand it probably wouldn't matter that much which method one chooses, since
most reasonable methods would probably tend to produce identical results
most of the time.
