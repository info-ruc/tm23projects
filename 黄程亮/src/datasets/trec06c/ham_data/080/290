Hi,

I have a question about the Computer Modern fonts. When I print documents 
written in CM fonts with a 600dpi printer, the output on paper appears a 
bit light (though on the computer screen it looks great). I'm aware that 
the CM fonts are supposed to look that way (light) so I was wondering if 
there's any workaround to make the output on paper look thicker/darker. OR 
is there another font that looks similar to the CM font but is darker? I 
think this font looks awesome and so I'd like to stick to it as much as 
possible.

Thanks,
nirmal
