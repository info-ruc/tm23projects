Why MGMX should be on your radar screen now!

GOLD= way over $600 an ounce and some analysts predict gold will go way higher.

Glamis Gold, once as low as $2.68 a share, now $42. Agnico Eagle, a $5 stock in 
2001, now $40. Royal Gold, trading at $2.60 just five years ago, now fetching $34 a share. 

These are the mining companies that Wall Street “wouldn’t touch with a ten-foot pole.”
