Hello...

    What follows is an article taken from the February 23rd issue of The
Economist.  (I should clean my closet more often.)


    How many people are needed in a spaceship?  Regular readers will know
that The Economist's answer to this question is: "none; space exploration is
better done by robots".  But this is true only if scientific information is
the goal.  If the aim is colonisation, then both men and women are
necessary.
    In a session on interstellar travel at the AAAS festival in Boston, John
Moore of the University of Florida, Gainesville, asked what human population
would be necessary for a colonising mission to another solar system.
    It would be a long trip.  Several bright physicists have spent their
leisure hours designing propulsion systems that could send a craft to a
nearby star in less than a human lifetime.  One popular solution is to
unfurl a light sail that would capture the energy beamed at it from a
powerful laser in orbit around the sun.  The problem is that deceleration at
the other end takes so much time and energy that such a system is suitable
only for 'fly-by' missions.  A manned craft would take centuries to arrive,
and would therefore require some sort of self-contained colony in which
people could survive, reproduce and lead something approaching normal lives
[I don't know if we could put that many politicians and criminals on
board...].  The technical, ecological and financial problems of building
such a colony ship would be enormous, of course.  But even if they were
overcome, the society inside would itself have to be viable [that was a
_long_ segue!].
    Dr. Moore, an anthropologist, set himself the task of designing such a
society.  He saw the crux of it as a compact between the generations to
produce an acceptable crop of spouses for the future.  By 'acceptable' he
meant sufficient in number (a minimum choice of ten suitable members of the
opposite sex) [ten!  no wonder I haven't found a mate yet], and of suitable
age (within three years of the individual doing the choosing) and
consanguinity (not closer than second cousins).  A computer model of his
devising ["devising"?  what, a model isn't accurate unless someone else had
the chance to screw it up?] showed that an initial group of 150-180 people
was just big enough to fulfill these criteria.  Even when the model was run
for 60-80 generations -- equivalent to a journey time of 2,000 years -- the
compact could hold.  Coincidentally (or perhaps not) the figure of 150-180
is the number of people which psychological testing has shown that an
individual can know well enough to have a permanent relationship with.  It
is also the maximum size that anthropologists find for clans of
hunter-gatherers, villages in pre-industrial societies, and even infantry
companies in armies.  Dr. Moore's woolgathering [I resent that! "vital
contribution"...] might therefore have illuminated an important aspect of
humanity's past, as well as pointing to its possible future.

Good paper on the evolution of Robert Forward's original Starwisp design:

http://www.aleph.se/Trans/Tech/Space/laser.txt

Landis has done a lot of work on refining and reducing the concept into
something that is practical with today's technology.

ANOTHER UNIVERSE MIGHT LURK ONLY MILLIMETERS
away from our universe, but we wouldn't know it because it exists
on its own membrane separated from our membrane in some extra
spatial dimension.  Matter on the other membrane would be
invisible but could exert a gravitational effect and would, in fact,
constitute the "dark matter" for which astrophysicists have sought
for some years.  In a recent paper Paul Steinhardt (Princeton) and
Neil Turok (Cambridge) propose that the structure in our universe
may well have come about in the collision of two such membrane
universes.  All the historical events in the life of our
cosmos initial big bang, subsequent expansion of galaxies, even
the currently observed accelerated expansion phase, and finally a
contraction into a "big crunch" would be played out in a recurring
drama.  This cyclic cosmology (an extension of Steinhardt's
"ekpyrosis" theory; see Update 535) uses all the latest tools of
string theory, accounts for the "dark energy" supposedly firing
cosmic acceleration, and would have no need for an ad-hoc
"inflationary" phase appended to the standard big bang model to
explain such cosmological features such as the horizon problem
(why the extreme edges of the visible universe seem to be at the
same temperature).  (Sciencexpress, 25 April, soon to be in

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                             May 
29, 2002

WAS EINSTEIN WRONG?  SPACE STATION RESEARCH MAY FIND OUT

     Ultra-precise clocks on the International Space Station and other 
space missions may 
determine whether Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity is 
correct and could dramatically 
change our understanding of the universe.

     The theory, introduced in 1905, holds that if an observer moves at 
a uniform speed, no matter 
how fast or in what direction, the laws of physics and the speed of 
light are always the same. For 
example, if you stand still and drop a coin, it will fall straight 
down. Similarly, if you drop a coin 
inside a car while you're driving down the freeway at a steady speed, 
it will also fall straight down.

     However, recent theories attempting to combine gravity and 
particle physics suggest that 
relativity might not always apply; changes in space and time may occur 
that could not be measured 
easily on Earth. 

     "The International Space Station will have ultra-sensitive clocks 
on board, and it is a good 
place to test the theory," said Dr. Alan Kostelecky, professor of 
physics at Indiana University, 
Bloomington. "By comparing extremely precise clocks that can operate 
under zero gravity, 
minuscule changes in the ticking rate might be found as the spacecraft 
moves around Earth." This 
would violate Einstein's theory, which says there should be no change 
if different clocks in the same 
gravity environment are compared.

     "Finding such changes would cause an upheaval in the science 
community and revolutionize 
our thinking about the fundamental structure of space and time," he 
added. "It would lead to insight 
about how our universe formed and how nature operates."

     Measurements in space have several advantages over ones on Earth 
because the Earth's 
rotation axis and its rotation rate are fixed. In space the orbital 
axis of a satellite and its rotation rate 
can be different, and higher speeds are possible. Measurements in space 
would therefore be more 
sensitive to minute changes that would violate Einstein's Theory of 
Relativity.

     Kostelecky and his colleagues Robert Bluhm of Colby College, 
Waterville, Me.; Charles 
Lane of Berry College, Mount Berry, Ga.; and Neil Russell of Northern 
Michigan University, 
Marquette, propose using specific types of clocks on the space station. 
For example, one type would 
use a maser, a cousin of the laser. Instead of emitting light, like a 
laser, the maser emits microwave 
energy at a specific frequency, which produces a very specific ticking.

     Other types of clocks already planned for flight on the 
International Space Station could be 
used too. Upcoming missions include the Primary Atomic Reference Clock 
in Space, the Rubidium 
Atomic Clock Experiment and the Superconducting Microwave Oscillator. 
All three are part of 
NASA's Fundamental Physics Program. In addition, the Atomic Clock 
Ensemble in Space will be 
flown on the International Space Station by the European Space Agency.

     Kostelecky says clock experiments in space may yield other 
intriguing results. For example, 
they might provide evidence for string theory. Traditionally, 
scientists have believed that the smallest 
units in the universe are particles. However, advocates of string 
theory believe the smallest units are 
elongated, like tiny pieces of string. In some string theories, empty 
space has an intrinsic direction. 
This could cause the clocks on the space station to tick at changing 
rates, depending on their 
orientation. 

     In addition to the International Space Station, other future 
missions may also test the Theory 
of Relativity. The proposed SpaceTime mission would fly three clocks 
past Jupiter, then would drop 
the spacecraft rapidly in toward the Sun, like an extreme version of an 
amusement park freefall ride. 
The high speed of this NASA mission would make possible new kinds of 
sensitive tests.

     The paper by Kostelecky and his colleagues appeared in the March 4 
issue of the Physical 
Review Letters. It is available online at: http://prola.aps.org volume 
88, article 090801 for 2002.

Intelligent Aliens?


By Seth Shostak
Senior Astronomer, Project Phoenix
posted: 07:00 am ET
30 May 2002



There may be a lot of life in the universe. If so, its a safe bet that most
of it will score lower on the SATs than you.

Just consider the situation on one planet: ours. There are millions of
species on Earth. Millions. Among this protoplasmic plentitude, how many
species are smart enough to be interesting on the telephone or able to help
you with Sundays crossword? Well, theres Homo sapiens, and then theres
nobody.

Is this a momentous fact or not? Is the circumstance that we can look around
and find were the brainiest boffins on the planet merely a trivial result
of being the first species able to notice? Or is there some reason to think
that intelligence is actually a rare and unlikely evolutionary development,
and Homo sapiens has lucked out?

This is more than just another good question to bandy about after dinner,
between the cigars and the port. It goes right to the heart of our place in
the universe. And its also of obvious and critical importance to SETI
researchers. After all, were on a fools mission deploying our SETI
telescopes if theres no intelligent life out there.

So how can we judge whether intelligence is a likely evolutionary
development or not? We do the obvious, and look for hints in Earths
history. Earth is, after all, the only example we have. Since high IQ
critters appeared here, theres a tendency to assume that our planet is just
another typical, run-of-the-mill rocky world, and what happened on our
planet might happen on their planet, too. Sooner or later, intelligence will
arise.

But there are flies in this ointment. Sixty-five million years ago, a rock
the size of Brooklyn slammed into the Earth, wiping out three-fourths of all
species, including the dinosaurs. If this hadnt happened, the rat-like
mammals that eventually evolved into Homo sapiens wouldnt have inherited
the world. And 245 million years ago, another catastrophe (known in polite
society as the Permian extinction) wrote finis to an even larger percentage
of species. These cosmic accidents were all forks in the long road that
eventually led to us. Maybe on other worlds, the road never gets that far.

On the other hand, there are some common behaviors among animals that seem
to favor intelligence. Social interaction, for example. If youre a critter
that hangs out with others, then theres clearly an advantage in being smart
enough to gauge the intentions of the guy sitting next to you (before he
nabs your mate or your meal). And if youre clever enough to outwit the
other members of your social circle, youll probably have enhanced
opportunity to breed (to put it graciously), thus passing on your superior
smarts.

Predator-prey relations are another type of interaction that can ratchet up
intelligence. When a lioness catches a wildebeest, shes more likely to snag
the dumb one that wasnt paying attention. Result? The lioness has a meal,
but the average IQ of the wildebeests has been raised. This puts the lions
under increased pressure in running down their next meal, and the dumber
cats will preferentially drop out of the gene pool. Both predator and prey
will be under selective pressure for intelligence.

All of this sounds as if Nature  whether on our planet or some alien
world  will stumble into increased IQ sooner or later. But keep in mind
that many of the dinosaurs were in predator-prey relations (and may have
been somewhat social, too). Why didnt they get smart? After all, they had
140 million years to do so.

When it comes to the evolution of intelligence, the bottom line is that we
dont know the bottom line. And indeed, we may never know how likely it is
that intelligence will appear unless and until we find it elsewhere. So we
ll keep deploying those SETI telescopes.

I've recently reinstalled my computer with Win2k, following the rather
extending death-throws of '98.  Decided to reduce the system load a little
this time by opting for a combined messenger, Trillian.  Today while
downloading a few skins for said program, my mind wandered onto the simple
question of ergonomics.
Visually, the base Trillian skin is resonable enough, though a little
difficult to read, I found.
I'm not sugesting the use of interface skins, even though it could make
tasks easier for individuals, it would make other task more difficult if,
say, you forgot your own skin password and had to figure out which Smiley
repressents the command to dump the engine-core before it blows.

As I see it, ergonomics is also about more than ease-of-use, when regarding
control systems, it must also be intuitive (red=bad/danger, sorta stuff).
Anyway, I have a few ideas on paper, and hopefully get them uploaded when I
have some webspace again.

Either case, I would count
http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/skins/DreamScreen.jpg to be a good and clear
example, while http://www.ceruleanstudios.com/skins/s3-screenshot.gif is
not, due to it's difficult to read font and background/text colour choices.

For the most part though, the argument is academic at this time, as the
entire computer system, in my mind, should be redesigned from scratch. Home
PCs carry with them decades of obsolete design-traits, to make them
backwards-compatible primarily. The ship-board computers have very little
family to be compatible with, so mark a great point at which to start over
from scratch.  Such recent developments such as 1000 electron memorys would
be perfect be for use amid a ships various internal and external sensors,
providing a sort of integral black-box (electron memory, does not rely of
capacitors on chips, and is entirly stable).
In a similer sence we can rule out certain future technologys for use in
ships, as quantum-computers need only  asingle cosmic-ray to spoil them, and
a likewise small charge to spoil a high-density computer chip.  Some things
just seem too delicate to use.

I would like to suggest though, as it is frequently pointed out a lot of
computer-power could be used for navigation, that a seperate, or remote,
computer be used entirely for navigation.  Designed and intended for
plotting of courses (and their execution too?), it would most likely be
vastly supperior in operation to a large multi-purpose machine.
Even today, a high-spec machine running an emulator, can be beaten by the
old WW2 code-crackers, because it has been designed and built for that
purpose alone.  Utterly dedicated.
I envision a unit that plugged into the ships network, but it unlike the
rest of it.  It only uses the network for sending and receiving of the raw
data, and none of it's processing.  Able to use it's inbuilt navigation
engine, to desern the best aproach-paths, orbits, exit-path, headings, etc..
and feed them to the navigational displays for confirmation/use.

Such output I feel would be a good use for the relativly primative
holographics we have available to us.  I imagine 3D navigation might be
rather tricky without it to enable us to visualise it.
The one that springs to mind was shown on a BBC program, "Tommorows World"
some years ago, and I seem unable to find a more up to date source of
information on it.  It was being concidered as an alternate display for
air-traffic-control.
It concisted of a tube with a rapidly spinning single-helix within it, a
single turn of which took up the entire height of the small chamber.  It was
spun, and since the helix took up only one turn of height, a laser,
projected from below witht he right timing, was able to set the point of
it's height by whatever part of the helix was passing above it at the time,
thus enabling graphics to be displayed as a truely 3D image.
A larger, and preferably colour, vesion of this I think be the perfect
navigational display.

For the momment, that's all I have to say, but I do ask something also.
A long time ago, an aquaintence mentioned a theoretical drive-system he
called a Spin-Drive, that was supposed to use so quirk of quantum to enfold
a craft in a mobile pocket-universe.  Was he merely quoting some sci-fi
story, or is there some backing for this?  I have been unable to find
further information.

My best wishes,

Sci
