Please take this in the helpful spirit intended, but the answer to your
problem
is what is known as "design."  There are very few pairs of serif and sans
serif
fonts that work together.  There is no reason at all why Gill Sans and Caslon
should harmonize.  Caslon represents the taste (and, if it is faithfully done,
the technology) of the early 18th century at the latest, and Gill the 20s of
the twentieth century.   

There were certain foundries in the middle of the last century (ITC is the
most
awful example) which tried to make all fonts into the same porridgy slop by
boosting the x-height of classical fonts and lowering the ascenders so that
everything would look like a fussy modification of AvantGarde, but there is
some reason to hope that this habit is now out of date.  

If you want to mix seriffed and sans serif types, get a font book and study
the
proportions of the various offerings, preferably with someone who has done a
little design at your side.  I don't imagine that such a person would ever be
likely to suggest that you start with a Caslon if you want to intermingle it
with a sans serif---at least not with a well-designed Caslon.  They come from
two so radically different worlds that the effect is almost certain to be more
bizarre than anything else.  Designers like Chuck Bigelow, who recognize the
requirements of modern publication and the limits of modern technology have
given the idea some careful thought, and if you use something out of the
Lucida
family you may well find your problem goes away.  

Otherwise, your sans-serif will always look, as Parkinson once put it, like a
short sharp anchovy in a strawberry ice.
