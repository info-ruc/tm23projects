Some publishers have been faced with this dilemma:
people like to use CM, because it is "traditional",
but don't like how thin it really is.

In some cases they have commissioned special Type 1 versions
of the CM fonts (or a subset thereof) that are "darker".  Since
making quality Type 1 fonts is a non-trivial amount of work,
this has cost them quite a bit.

When using bitmapped versions of the fonts, people have
modified the MetaFont commands to "fatten" the strokes.

regards, Berthold.
