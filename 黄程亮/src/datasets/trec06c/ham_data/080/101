Has anyone developed or know of any rubrics as an evaluation instrument for 
lesson study material?  If you were designing rubrics what would you use as 
guides.

We are initiating a lesson study project to determine if curriculum that 
includes cultural themes impact on the motivation and ultimately the academic 
achievement of students and would like to develop rubrics evaluating the 
lessons.

Thanks for any assistance or leads.
