I also thought about f for "free" :-)  The font files
were "physically" supplied by URW, that's why I chose u.

Sigh... I didn't know that. (I didn't install XFree; 
I just took out the fonts.)  Does it actually matter 
from a technical point of view?

On screen, maybe.  In print, however, LuxiSerif and 
LuxiSans look extremely narrow and are suitable for 
special purposes only.  

LuxiMono, in contrast, is a general-purpose typewriter 
font and blends well with "strong" typefaces such as 
Palatino or Charter.  So far, no such font was available 
for free.
