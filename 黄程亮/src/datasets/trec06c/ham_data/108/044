***************************************************************
Third international conference on
Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics
University of Bristol - UK
September 5-7, 2006
http://www.enm.bris.ac.uk/SMPS/

ABOUT SMPS
Over the last thirty years there has been a growing interest in
extending the theory of probability and statistics to allow for more
flexible modelling of uncertainty, ignorance and fuzziness. Most
such extensions result in a "softening" of the classical theory, to
allow for imprecision in probability judgements and to incorporate
fuzzy constraints and events. Many approaches utilise concepts,
tools and techniques developed in theories such as fuzzy set theory,
possibility theory, imprecise probability theory and Dempster-Shafer
theory.

The need for soft extensions of probability theory is becoming
apparent in a wide range of applications areas. For example, in data
analysis and data mining it is becoming increasingly clear that
integrating fuzzy sets and probability can lead to more robust and
interpretable models that better capture both the inherent
uncertainty and fuzziness of the underlying data. Also, in science
and engineering the need to analyse and model the true uncertainty
associated with complex systems requires a more sophisticated
representation of ignorance than that provided by uninformative
Bayesian priors.

Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics (SMPS) 2006 will be
hosted by the Artificial Intelligence Group, Department of
Engineering Mathematics at the University of Bristol, UK. This is
the third of a series of biennial conferences organized in 2002 by
the Systems Research Institute from the Polish Academy of Sciences
in Warsaw (SMPS 2002) and in 2004 by the Department of Statistics
and Operation Research at the University of Oviedo in Spain (SMPS 2004).

SMPS 2006 aims to provide a forum for researchers to present and
discuss ideas, theories, and applications. The scope of conference
is to bring together experts representing all existing and novel
approaches to soft probability and statistics. In particular, we
would welcome papers combining probability and statistics with
fuzzy logic, applications of the Dempster-Shafer theory,
possibility theory, generalized theories of uncertainty,
generalized random elements, generalized probabilities and so on.

PROCEEDINGS
The proceedings of SMPS 2006 will be published as an edited volume
by Springer in the series Advances in Soft Computing.

INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS
Papers should be no longer than 8 pages and in the Springer style
for papers in edited volumes described at
http://www.springer.com/series/4240.

Papers can be prepared using the Latex style file as shown in the
sample document posted on the conference website.

Papers should be submitted as pdf documents by email to
smps-06@bris.ac.uk

TIMETABLE AND DEADLINES

  of the conference fee - 1 May 2006.

CONFERENCE VENUE
The SMPS 2006 conference will take place at the Merchant Venturers
Building in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Bristol.
Bristol is a historic city surrounded by beautiful countryside at
the heart of South West England. Famous Bristolians include:
Isambard Kingdom Brunel, Cary Grant, Daniel Defoe, Paul Dirac,
Sir Humphry Davy, John Wesley and of course Wallace and Gromit.
