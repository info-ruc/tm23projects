NSF-supported conference
Finite Element Methods in Engineering and Science
FEMTEC 2006 - CALL FOR PAPERS
http://servac.math.utep.edu/femtec_2006/

WELCOME

The NSF-supported conference Finite Element Methods in
Engineering and Science (FEMTEC 2006) will take place at the
University of Texas at El Paso on December 11 - 15, 2006.

The goal of FEMTEC 2006 is to advance the frontiers in performance
and reliability of finite element methods, as well as in their
application to computational engineering and science. The main
topics of the meeting will include the following areas of emerging
importance:

MAIN TOPICS

* Reliability, validation, and verification of FEM models
* Uncertainty: Interval and probabilistic FEM
* Higher-order methods: Spectral and hp-FEM
* Enriched and extended methods (X-FEM)
* Advanced engineering and scientific applications

Expected size of the meeting is 8 invited plenary lectures, 30
contributed talks, and several poster presentations. Participation
of students, young researchers, women, under-represented minorities
and people with disabilities is encouraged. A limited number of
travel grants is available.

ABSTRACTS

All participants presenting an oral contribution or
poster are asked to submit a one-page abstract via the
Pre-Registration section of this web page until the end of March
2006. Abstracts must be written using our Latex template available
at the conference website. Book of Abstracts will be distributed to
participants at registration.

PRESENTATIONS

* Invited plenary lectures: 50 minutes followed by 10 minutes of
  discussion.
* Contributed talks: 25 minutes followed by 5 minutes of
  discussion.
* Poster presentations: Posters will be exhibited during
  the entire meeting. Maximum format of a poster is A0
  (33.11 X 46.81 inches, 841 X 1189 mm). Best poster prize will be
  awarded during the Farewell party on Thursday.
The scientific committee reserves the right to decide
about the form of contributed presentations.

PROCEEDINGS

The proceedings will appear as a special issue of J.
Comput. Appl. Math. (ISSN 0377-0427). Papers will be written
according to journal's standards (see the JCAM's web page
http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/505613/desc
ription#description).
Page limit for both the invited and contributed papers will be
announced later. Each paper will be subject to standard review
process. Papers originated in posters and oral contributions will
be subject to the same procedure.
