   Yeah, we've seen that before.  I'm not recalling specifically what it 
was though so you might want to spend some quality time with the 
archives.  If you're not running the latest version of DMDX you might try 
that just incase it wasn't a driver issue and I actually had to fix 
something in DMDX.

   I'm betting it was with bad video drivers, failing that it was bad sound 
card drivers.  If you're not using any sound files then it's more than 
likely video chipset driver update time.  Of course there's always the DMDX 
for GeForce Video Card shortcut and if that fails the DMDX for Really Bad 
Video Cards.
