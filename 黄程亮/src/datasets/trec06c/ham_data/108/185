Hi Kris,

Our primary tool for dealing with spam is greylsiting.
      http://projects.puremagic.com/greylisting/

Since greylisting isn’t perfect, we also perform analysis on all email and
assign as spam score. The score is added to the email header and the
recipient can then filter based on this.

We also scan all messages for viruses. If a virus is detected, the message
is cleaned and a warning is attached that some message content has been
removed along with additional details about the specific virus.

We try to never “silently” bounce any email. Either the sender or the
receiver should be notified if a message hasn’t been delivered along with
an explanation.
