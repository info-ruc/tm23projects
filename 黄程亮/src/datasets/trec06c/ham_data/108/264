ANNOUNCING: Fall 2005 Scholarship Workshops

Believe it or not, it's already time to think about how you will fund your
2006-7 school year. Scholarships providing free money for college are one of
the very best ways to get this done! Attend one or both of these sessions
and increase your chances of claiming a scholarship for the next school
year.

FIND AND COMPETE FOR SCHOLARSHIPS
What could be bad about free money for school that never has to be repaid?
Maybe just the work it takes to find the right program and complete a
winning application. Learn how to make this process easier and achieve your
scholarship goals.
