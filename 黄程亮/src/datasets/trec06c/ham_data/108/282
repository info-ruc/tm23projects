Thanks for your reply. But we don't know how the effect of <delay 1> and <delay
2> can help us solve our problem. When we try running the lines you provided,
we found that there is a long delay between "circle" and "cross". So our
problem cannot be solved. In some trials the ISI is 10ms, what we want to
achieve is that both the RTs for the circle and cross can be recorded.

Thanks.
