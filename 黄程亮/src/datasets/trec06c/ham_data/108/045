Homecoming Pep Rally
It is scheduled for Thursday Nov. 3rd, from 12:30-2pm at the EMU amphitheater.

They are requesting, that a representative from each team be present 
to be recognized wearing their team shirts.  The representatives will 
be introduce and may help lead the fight song.  They will also pick 
winners of a raffle.  They also hope that if any other athletes are 
in the area at that time that they can drop by and be recognized.


Please let me know if you are interested as soon as possible (By 
Friday Oct. 28th) so I can give them a rough estimate of who will be attending.

Trick or Treat!
Monday Oct. 31st

Had out Candy to Kids at the Women's Basketball game

So Halloween is Monday and the Marketing department has asked for our 
help.  Now before you go and say it is Halloween and we are going to 
be out having a good time, hear me out.  They would like some student 
athletes to attend the Women's Basketball game that night from 
6pm-7pm and help hand out CANDY to little kids who will be 
Trick-or-Treating around the Basketball arena.  It would be a lot of 
fun and early enough to go have fun afterwards .  You would be able 
to support the Women's Basketball team, you would probably get some 
candy, and most of all the Kids would love to see you there!  So 
please go to your teams and see if anyone is interested in 
helping.  Let me know as soon as you can.  Thanks and have a Happy Halloween!
