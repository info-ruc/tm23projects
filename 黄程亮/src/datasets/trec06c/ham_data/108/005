Distinctions Program

Subject: Professional Distinctions Program

=20

We would like to draw your attention to an exciting program at the U of
O - Professional Distinctions.  Because you have achieved at least a 3.0
GPA and have completed more for than 60 credits, you qualify for this
innovative program that will give you an advantage in the job market and
add breadth to your education. =20

=20

The UO Professional Distinctions Program leads you through experiences
that, simply put, prepare you for your professional life after college
while enhancing your current studies.  Completion of a Professional
Distinction adds a set of skills that will enhance your attractiveness
to future employers and graduate programs.  The program has four
components: 1) an academic area of concentration that is complementary
to your primary major, 2) an internship experience in your area of
concentration, 3) participation in four Career Success seminars offered
regularly by the Career Center, and 4) development of your resume.

=20

While any minor or second major can serve as an area of concentration,
we have also created a number of interdisciplinary concentrations, each
with a professional focus, including Leadership, Analytical Reasoning,
Data Analysis, Professional Research and Presentation, and International
Communication and Culture, among others.

=20

Graduates of the program receive a "Certificate of Completion" signed by
the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences and this achievement is
perfect for highlighting on a resume or graduate school application.

=20

Interested?  Please visit our website where you can create a login and
submit a proposal today at: http://uodistinctions.uoregon.edu
<http://uodistinctions.uoregon.edu/>=20

=20

Need more information?  Please join us for an information session on the
program in the Gumwood Room of the EMU from 3-4 pm on Tuesday, November
1st .  This informal meeting will introduce you to the program, provide
valuable information about obtaining a great internship, and allow you
to ask more questions about the program from faculty advisors.

=20

I sincerely hope you give this program serious consideration and hope
you can join us for the information session.  If you have individual
questions, please feel free to send those to our
uodistinctions@cas.uoregon.edu or my personal email, bruceb@uoregon.edu.
