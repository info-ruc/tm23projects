I now have a very peculiar problem, similar to, but not the same as
others reported.

On a Toshiba laptop, I can run DMDX no problem - I get the end message,
and asked whether to 'save the data'. I say yes, the data is saved, and
then finally the screen goes white and the whole laptop freezes. (seems
like the close down process for DMDX is failing somewhere and not
returning control to Windows?) Nothing gets me out of the freeze other
than a reboot. The run data has been successfully saved. The same
happens if I say I Don't want to save data so it's not a disc problem or
anything like that - sounds much more like a video problem with DMDX not
being able to revert to the original video settings ?
