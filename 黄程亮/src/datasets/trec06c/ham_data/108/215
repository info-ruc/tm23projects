   The fixed Delay is done with the <Delay> parameter -- note that it's not 
required if you're going to use <rcot>.  You would use Excel or something 
else to calculate the RTs.  I'd subtract the two RCOT times, add the second 
response and subtract the first and you've got time from one RT to the next.

   If you use <rcot> the DMDX script is only going to differ from a normal 
script by the addition of <rcot> in the parameter line.  Scripts for 
processing the results aren't within my purview.
