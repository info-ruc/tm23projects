   Odd, ours appears as "InstaCal Board 0 PCI-DIO24".  You sure yours has 
12 in it and not 24?

   No, the input boxes should all have "high" or "low" in them.  Perhaps 
your card doesn't have input on it or if it does it's somehow been disabled 
by the InstaCal software.  I'd go back to the InstaCal stuff and check all 
the settings.
