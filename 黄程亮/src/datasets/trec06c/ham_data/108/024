Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics SMPS 2006 Bristol, UK, 5-7
September 2006 Call for Papers

Over the last thirty years there has been a growing interest in
extending the theory of probability and statistics to allow for more
flexible modelling of uncertainty, ignorance, and fuzziness. Most such
extensions result in a "softening" of the classical theory, to allow for
imprecision in probability judgements and to incorporate fuzzy
constraints and events. Many approaches utilise concepts, tools and
techniques developed in theories such as fuzzy set theory, possibility
theory, imprecise probability theory and Dempster-Shafer theory.

The need for soft extensions of probability theory is becoming apparent
in a wide range of applications areas. For example, in data analysis and
data mining it is becoming increasingly clear that integrating fuzzy
sets and probability can lead to more robust and interpretable models
that better capture both the inherent uncertainty and fuzziness of the
underlying data. Also, in science and engineering the need to analyse
and model the true uncertainty associated with complex  systems requires
a more sophisticated representation of ignorance than that provided by
uninformative Bayesian priors.

Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics (SMPS) 2006 will be hosted by
the Artificial Intelligence Group, Department of Engineering Mathematics
at the University of Bristol, UK.

This is the third of a series of biennial conferences organized in
2002 by the Systems Research Institute from the Polish Academy of
Sciences in Warsaw and in 2004 by the Department of Statistics and
Operation Research at the University of Oviedo in Spain.

SMPS 2006 aims to provide a forum for researchers to present and discuss
ideas, theories, and applications. The scope of conference is to bring
together experts representing all existing and novel approaches to soft
probability and statistics.
In particular, we would
welcome papers combining probability and statistics with fuzzy logic,
applications of the Dempster-Shafer theory, possibility theory,
generalized theories of uncertainty, generalized random elements,
generalized probabilities and so on.

Detailed info will be forthcoming.
