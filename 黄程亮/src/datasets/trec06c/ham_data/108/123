Hi
Someone suggested that i omit the "/" after the word stimuli and that
solved the problem. However, i am getting this error message in my zil
file.

Display error at msec 401.31, tick 13 in item 0, frame "Practice Items"
!    moved into video memory 4 ticks late
!     (previous frame's duration will have been longer)
!    -- possibly caused by another process taking 3 ticks

Can someone help me understand what that means? and whether i should fix
this even though the experiment runs.

Cheers
Michelle

Hey Andy

Thanks alot for the suggestion. Unfortunately, the <clfb> addition didn't
appear to help as the screen did not clear immediately upon the response.
This is the new set of parameters i used. I am pretty sure that i need to
omit something from it which is causing the delay.
