Dear Friends, This is FYI. Please note that interval-valued fuzzy sets and implicitly listed as one of the possible topics of interest, as part of type-2 fuzzy sets.

World Congress of the International Fuzzy Systems Association
IFSA 2007
Cancun, Mexico, June 20-23, 2007
http://www.hafsamx.org/ifsa2007/index.htm

MAIN THEME OF THE CONGRESS
Theory and Applications of Fuzzy Logic and Soft Computing

ORGANIZED BY:
* Tijuana Institute of Technology
* Hispanic American Fuzzy Systems Association HAFSA

SUPPORTED BY: COSNET-DGEST

IN COOPERATION WITH: Mexican Chapter of the IEEE
  Computational Intelligence Society CIS

The World Congress will consist of papers describing research work
that deals with Computational Intelligence (CI) methodologies for
the development of hybrid intelligent systems. CI methodologies at
the moment include (at least) Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks, Genetic
Algorithms, Intelligent Agents, and Chaos Theory. The use of
intelligent techniques, like neural networks, fuzzy logic and
genetic algorithms, for real-world problems is now widely accepted.
However, still the performance of any of these techniques can be
improved, in many situations, by using them in conjunction with
other techniques. For example, genetic algorithms can be used to
optimize the design of a neural network for time series prediction,
or fuzzy logic can be used to combine the information from expert
neural modules, just to mention two cases. Also, mathematical
methods, like the ones from Chaos and Fractal Theory, can be used in
conjunction with intelligent techniques to improve the performance
of hybrid systems for real-world applications. The international
conference will consist of papers addressing these hybrid approaches
and similar ones, either theoretically or for real-world applications.
Also, distinguished internationally recognized invited speakers will
give lectures on the main areas of CI. The conference is intended
primarily for researchers and graduate students working on these
research areas.

TOPICS OF INTEREST

1 Successful new applications to real-world problems of CI techniques
  that are found to achieve better results than conventional techniques.
  In this case, special attention should be given to the metrics used
  to compare CI techniques with conventional ones.

2 Developments of innovative hybrid methods combining CI techniques
  and conventional techniques. In this case, the problems to be
  considered in these papers may not be as complex as the ones in the
  previous point, but the authors have to explain very carefully how
  their proposed method could be used, in the future, to solve
  real-world problems.

3 Papers considering original research on new CI architectures,
  models or techniques are also welcome, but the authors would have to
  make a detailed description of how their proposed approach is
  compared with other related approaches.

ABOUT CANCUN:
Cancun is a beautiful city with world class hotels and resorts and
incredible beaches and it is easily accessible by air from America,
Europe and Asia. Cancun is situated in the Yucatan peninsula with
beautiful beaches in the Caribbean Sea and it is also very near the
well-known ancient Mayan ruins. Cancun is also a very safe city
with modern shopping centers, entertainment parks, and excellent
restaurants for all tastes. Also, we have to say Cancun is the most
preferred city for Conferences to be held in Mexico. In conclusion,
Cancun is the ideal place for the IFSA 2007 Congress.
