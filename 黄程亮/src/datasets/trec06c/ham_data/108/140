Hello everybody,
 
I`m preparing an experiment on masked priming with pictures. When running the experiment on my notebook the program flashes some pictures where they shouldn´t appear, for example if the sequence is Mask, prime, mask, the programm flashes onto the screen a picture of the prime before the first mask.  
 
I get the display errors (almost in every line of the script of my experiment)

>! moved into video memory X ticks late
>! (previous frame's duration will have been longer)
>! -- possibly caused by another process taking 3 ticks
 
Johnathan you recently wrote to the list:
 
"When using a fixed delay between items it's pretty common to see just 
the first item have a timing error like this. It takes some machines a lot 
longer to get the first display requests done and once they're out of the 
way the rest of the experiment is often fine."
 
I have run the experiment on a friend´s notebook and the program flows
just fine. In my computer however, it takes longer to get the first display request done as you said, but once the request is done it keeps producing errors. It keeps on flashing pictures where they shouldn´t be and the exposure times of some of them seem to be suffering from important differences when they should be all of the same duration (this is important for my experiment because the primes must be subliminally presented). 
 
Is this a hardware problem?
Is there a way I can fix it without changing the machine?
 
Thank you very much. Best wishes.





Lisandro.
