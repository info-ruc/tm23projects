Hi everyone!

I have posted the position stand on Fluid Replacement during exercise in the "Course Documents" Folder.  We will discuss it next Wednesday  (Nov. 2nd).  In addition, we will have our mid-term exam on Friday Nov. 4th, which we will take the second half of class.  You will also receive a take-home portion of the exam that will be due the following Wednesay in class (Nov. 9th).  I will make extra time to be available to you on Wednesday and Thursday before the exam so we can disucss any questions you might have.  My suggestion is to start studying soon and try to meet with me (or John) before the exam if you are struggling with the material.  See you Friday!
