You really have to first prove that your ODEs are not sensitive to
initial conditions. If it is, them blowing up is built-in to the ODE,
and no method will help you. Or, if you find one that does, then it just
demonstrated that it is not 'reliable'!

If you can show that your ODE is relatively stable, then there are
methods that can help. This has been discussed on this list multiple
times - read http://interval.louisiana.edu/reliable_computing.txt
on how to access the archives. There certainly are many experts here who
can help you with this problem, if it is solveable.

Speaking of which, it would be really nice if the archives were
web-accessible. Are there any plans to do this?
