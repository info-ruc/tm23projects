   Well a <FrameDuration> of zero sure isn't going to help you, any frame 
without a specific duration won't get displayed.

   You need to specify a <Delay> of zero, DMDX will move to the next item 
as quick as possible.

   Only one clockon per item is allowed.

   You will have to.

   Not really.  Someone else might care to take a stab at it.

   You have to use two items.  If scrambling is causing you pairs to move 
away from each other then use the <Grouping> option in scrambling to pair 
items together, for instance <G 2>.
