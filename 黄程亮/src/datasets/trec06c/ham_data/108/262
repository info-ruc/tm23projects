We tried to recompose the program as the  lines below.

<ep> <nfb> <s 1> <g 2> <id "keyboard"><dbc 0> <dwc 000255000><vm 1024 768 768 16
0> <eop>
$
0 "instuctions"<umr><mr "+Space"><umpr> <umnr> <mpr "+A">  ;

~1 <set c1=lastXT> <return>;
~2 <bi 5, c1 .lt. 0>;
~3 <bi 5, lastXT .lt. 0>;
4 "correct" <return>;
5 "wrong" <return>;

~1000;
$

+1001 "circle" * <call 1>;
+1002 "cross" * <call 2>;

+2001 "circle" * <call 1>;
+2002 "cross" * <call 2>;

$ 
0 ¡§The End. Thank You.¡¨;
$



But we have two problems:

One is when we try running  the above lines. An error "Return without Call".
What does this mean?

Another is about the record and feedback of responses. In our experiment, two
stimuli will be presented sequentially. But in some trials, the ISI will be as
short as 10ms only. So if the two stimuli are separatesd in two lines, we are
afraid that the participants do not have enough time to respond after the first
stimulus is presented. How can we solve this problem?

Thanks a lot.
