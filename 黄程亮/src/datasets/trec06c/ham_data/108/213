   Yes.

   No, you would use a fixed delay between items and have to calculate what 
the time between clockons was later when you analyze the data.

   You could use <rcot> to simplify post run calculations so you know when 
each clockon occurred.  You could also probably use counters to calculate 
the times automatically, however that might be a little complicated.
