   I'm seeing reports on the developers list server again of timing 
inaccuracies in the function that DMDX uses for it's millisecond clock, 
namely QueryPerformanceCounter().  This time around it would appear that 
some systems that use AMD's X2 dual core CPUs have the 
problem.  QueryPerformanceCounter() can use a number of different sources 
as it's clock, notably either the 3.5Mhz PCI clock or the RTDSC that's part 
of the CPU whose frequency these days tends to be in the GHz range as it's 
tied to the CPU's clock frequency.  And therein lies the original problem 
on laptops as today's CPUs change their frequency to control their 
temperature so the frequency of our timers change too -- way bad.  Now we 
have these dual core CPUs where there are two RTDSC counters and they are 
not synchronized so the timer can leap ahead billions of counts (a second 
or two) and then leap back.  Which is why the TimeDX Millisecond Timer Test 
is there so there's a chance people will detect the problem.  A lot of 
machines seems to forgo using the RTDSC and instead use the 3579545 Hz PCI 
based one which as far as we know is stable so if you see TimeDX reporting 
that frequency you're golden.  If you see a much higher frequency and you 
have a desktop that's not a dual core machine you're still fine, otherwise 
you need to check that the millisecond timer test doesn't report something 
along these lines:

Performance Counter went backwards by 1234.5678ms!
This machine will not be able to run DMDX at all well.

   It's possible I can add code to DMDX to handle this but I don't want to 
as it will add a significant performance penalty -- I'm certainly not going 
to do it till someone reports having a machine with the problem (it's not 
all AMD X2 machines).   There's a good bit of pressure being put on MS both 
from within and without to fix this so hopefully I won't have to resort to 
chicanery, right now it's wait and see.
