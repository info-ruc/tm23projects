Hi All,

there's a student in our department who would like to run an experiment in which
participants listen to sentences in a self-paced experiment. She'd like to
present the sentences a few words at a time, having the participants press a
key when they're ready to hear the next bit. She'd like to measure the time it
takes between each key press.

Is that possible? Would the script look like any script with .wav files using
the right shift key, for example, to bring up the next item, maybe using a long
timeout interval so people have time to bring up the next item? Or is there a
more elegant way of doing this?



Thanks,


Carrie
