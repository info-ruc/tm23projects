CS382m-ers,

I wanted to reiterate some announcements from yesterday's lecture:

1) My office hours for Wednesday Oct. 26 are canceled.  If there is 
desire, I can schedule some office hours late in the week; send me 
email if you are interested.

2) HW #4 will go out Wednesday 10/26 - it will be somewhat short and 
will cover main memory and virtual memory

3) We will discuss the project next Monday 10/31

4) Prof. Bill Mark will be guest-lecturing on graphics architectures on 
Wednesday 10/26.  Please read his handout before the lecture which I 
made available in class on 10/19 and 10/24.

Cheers,

SK
