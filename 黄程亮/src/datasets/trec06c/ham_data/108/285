   Don't think so, can't imagine that I would have ever exposed that.  If 
you want precision in the feedback you'll have to write a custom feedback 
routine on very similar fashion to the one I gave over the weekend only 
with more tests on lasXT for incorrect and too long.  The delay from the 
item _should_ apply over all non-display items (ones with ~ for a CR 
indicator) so in your RT items you should be able specify the delay of the 
feedback and in the last item of the feedback that displays either the 
"wrong", "correct" or "too long" message you should be able to specify the 
delay of the next RT item.  But everyone needs to bear in mind that unless 
you've deliberately made the display longer than the RT there's going to be 
a whole load of variability as the feedback is going to be scheduled from 
the RT and the RT isn't synchronized with the raster.  So yesterday's 
request for a 10ms delay from RT to feedback isn't going to happen too often.
