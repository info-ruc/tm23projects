Yikes!  Sorry guys - I just checked and it looks like the CherryOS 
project has gone under.  I'd blame Steve Jobs and his lawsuits.  So that 
means you probably won't have a clean all in one Mac solution.

You can try looking at PearPC - it's mainly a PowerPC emulator but they 
had a demo awhile back of specifically running Mac OS-X and might have 
instructions somewhere...
