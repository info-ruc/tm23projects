   Yeah, the only way this is going to be done correctly is with a bunch of 
branching or with counters and less branching.  Because you can't gather 
two responses in an item (you can gather more but DMDX can't process the 
results for feedback) you'll have to have a design that remembers the first 
response in determining what feedback to give for the second response.  So 
you can either have a design the branches depending on the result of the 
first item to either an item that can't have a correct response or one that 
could have one.  The way I'd be tempted to do it would be to have feedback 
turned off and load up a counter with the lastXT of the first item and then 
have a custom feedback routine for the second.  Something along these lines:

<ep> <nfb> <s 1> <g 2> <eop>
$
0 "instuctions" <bu 1000>;

~1 <set c1=lastXT> <return>;
~2 <bi 5, c1 .lt. 0>;
~3 <b1 5, lastXT .lt. 0>;
4 "correct" <return>;
5 "wrong" <return>;

~1000;
$

+1001 "circle" * <call 1>;
+1002 "cross" * <call 2>;

+2001 "circle" * <call 1>;
+2002 "cross" * <call 2>;

   Of course there are probably a dozen things I'm forgetting but that's 
how I'd start.
