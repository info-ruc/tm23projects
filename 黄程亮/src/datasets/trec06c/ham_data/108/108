 Dear Friends, 

This is a CFP for a prestigious conference which attracts top
researchers in logic and complexity. This time it is at Stanford in July
2006. 

This may be a good opportunity for us to showcase modal interval
computations and other applications of modal logic to control etc.

We know about it but most logicians are not that familiar with it, and
since there are not so many novel practical applications of logic, this
may be of great interest to them. 

Please let me know if there is an interest. 

Vladik

   (http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~wollic) which started in 1994 with the aim
of
   fostering interdisciplinary research in pure and applied logic,
   will be held in Stanford, CA, USA, July 18-21, 2006.

SCOPE
   Contributions are invited in the form of short papers (12 10pt pages)
in
   all areas related to logic, language, information and computation,
including:
     . context and situation theory
     . formal semantics of natural language
     . information update and belief revision; agent systems
     . logic, arithmetic and complexity
     . logic and databases
     . logic and game theory
     . logic and verification
     . logic programming and algebraic semantics
     . logical grammars
     . model theory, descriptive complexity
     . proof complexity
     . proof theory, lambda calculus, categorical logic
     . real computation, algebraic complexity
     . set theory
     . zero-knowledge proofs, probabilistic proofs, randomized
computation

SCIENTIFIC SPONSORSHIP
   The 13th WoLLIC'2006 has the scientific sponsorship of the
Association
   for Symbolic Logic (ASL), the Interest Group in Pure and Applied
Logics
   (IGPL), the European Association for Logic, Language and Information
(FoLLI),
   the European Association for Theoretical Computer Science (EATCS),
   the Sociedade Brasileira de Computacao (SBC), and the Sociedade
   Brasileira de Logica (SBL).

GUEST SPEAKERS
   Eli Ben-Sasson (Comput Sci Dept, Technion Inst of Technology, Israel)
   Solomon Feferman (Depts of Math and Philosophy, Stanford Univ, USA)
   Yuri Gurevich (Microsoft Research, USA)
   Ulrich Kohlenbach (Dept of Math, Darmsdadt Univ of Technology,
Germany)
   Thomas Scanlon (Maths Dept, Univ Calif at Berkeley, USA)
   Andre Scedrov (Dept of Math, University of Pennsylvania, USA)

THE LOCATION
   (to be confirmed)

SUBMISSION
   Papers (up to 12 pages 10pt) must be submitted via the web page
   http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~wollic/wollic2006/instructions.html/
   by February 21st, 2006 (WARNING: Titles and abstracts must be
registered
   at the same webpage by FEBRUARY 14th, 2006!).
   Papers must be written in English and give enough detail to allow the
   programme committee to assess the merits of the work.  Papers should
   start with a brief statement of the issues, a summary of the main
   results, and a statement of their significance and relevance to the
   workshop. References and comparisons with related work is also
expected.
   Technical development directed to the specialist should follow.
   Results must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
elsewhere,
   including the proceedings of other symposia or workshops. One author
of
   each accepted paper will be expected to attend the conference in
order
   to present it. Authors will be notified of acceptance by APRIL 21st,
2006,
   and final versions for the proceedings will have to be delivered
   (in LaTeX format) by MAY 12th, 2006.  The abstracts of the papers
will be
   published in a "Conference Report" section of the Logic Journal of
the IGPL
   (ISSN 1367-0751) (Oxford Univ Press, web page:
http://www.oup.co.uk/igpl)
   as part of the meeting report.  The proceedings will appear as a
volume in
   the Elsevier series "Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer
Science"
   (http://www.elsevier.nl/locate/entcs).  Full version of papers will
be
   refereed again for publication in a special issue of the Annals of
Pure
   and Applied Logic (TO BE CONFIRMED).

STUDENT GRANTS
   ASL sponsorship of WoLLIC'2006 also will permit student ASL members
to
   apply for (limited) ASL travel funds that we hope to make available
for
   sponsored meetings that take place in 2006
   (see http://www.aslonline.org/studenttravelawards.html)

IMPORTANT DATES
   February 14th, 2006: Paper registration deadline (with short
abstracts)
   February 21st, 2006: Paper submission deadline
