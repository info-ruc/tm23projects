Your undergraduate work has prepared you well for graduate school, 
but it might not have prepared you for taking the GRE. This workshop 
will offer comprehensive instruction and practice in the math, 
verbal, and analytical writing sections of the GRE, which is required 
for entrance into most university graduate programs. In addition to 
reviewing question types, participants will learn effective 
test-taking and pacing strategies. The practice materials include 
actual GREs.
