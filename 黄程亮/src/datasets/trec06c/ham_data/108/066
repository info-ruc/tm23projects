Hi there

I am attempting to run the emotional stroop task on DMDX at the moment and
have run into a few problems.

The task requires a fixation cross "+" to be presented for 500ms before a
coloured word (stimuli) is presented. The subject is required to respond
what colour the word is (4 responses - red, green, blue, yellow)as quickly
as possible.

I need the presented word to disappear immediately once a response is
entered. I don't seem to be able to do that. There is a delay after the
subject responds and i suspect that it is being presented at 500ms (like
the fixation cross). What am i missing?

This is my parameters:

<ep> N16 <azk> <cr> <fd 162> <d 12> <t 2500> <id #keyboard> <zil 4> <zor
4> <dbc 0>  <dwc 255255255> <nfb> <vm 800,600,600,16,0> <vzk +#200> <vzk
+#203> <vzk +#205> <vzk +#208> <eop>

An example of what i have next:
0 “Practice Items” <c>;
0 “Press SPACEBAR to start”;
+101 <%ms 500> “+” /<wc 255000000><umnr><umpr> <mpr +#200> <mnr
+#203><mnr +#205><mnr +#208> *“Happy”/;
+102 <%ms 500> “+” /<wc 000255000> <umnr><umpr><mpr +#208><mnr
+#203><mnr +#205> <mnr +#200> *“Follow”/;

Thanks
Michelle
