   It means you didn't include the <bu 1000> that my example had in it that 
branched over the subroutines.  The subroutines (items 1 to 5) can't be 
executed in the normal flow of an item.

   You're running at 100Hz refresh rate?  My experience has been that very 
few machines that use <vm 1024 768 16 0> are ever doing anything more than 
60Hz.  You might want to try <vm 1024 768 16 100> instead.

   You could try a <delay 1>, some machines are fast enough these days for 
it.  You'll probably want to put a <delay 50> or some such thing in the 
parameter line and in each item where you want a delay of a different 
length include an appropriate <delay>. For instance:

<ep> <nfb> <s 1> <g 2> <id "keyboard"><dbc 0> <dwc 000255000>
<vm 1024 768 768 16 100> <delay 50> <eop>

   Of course if you are going to be using bitmaps there's little chance 
that a bitmap will be read and displayed in a tick so you'll need to 
looking into the <MediaLife> keyword and making DMDX buffer all your bitmaps.
