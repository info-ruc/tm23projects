CS382m-ers,

For those of you needing the TRIPS tools for the empirical project, we 
have made a version available in /p on the UTCS computer systems.  In 
addition, there is a fair bit of documentation we just put on the 
course web site (many thanks to Kartik and members of the TRIPS team):

http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/skeckler/cs382m/handouts/trips.html

I do not recommend printing out the manuals there (at least not yet).  
Some are pretty long and you don't really need all of that info in 
post-tree form.

Cheers,

SK
