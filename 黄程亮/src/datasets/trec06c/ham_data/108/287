   In my examples recently the <Delay> usage I have given is wrong, the 
<Delay> needs to be in the item that is to be delayed, not the item 
before.  So this is wrong:

+1001 "circle" * <call 1> <delay 1>;
+1002 "cross" * <call 2>;
+2001 "circle" * <call 1> <delay 2>;
+2002 "cross" * <call 2>;

   It should be:

+1001 "circle" * <call 1>;
+1002 <delay 1> "cross" * <call 2>;
+2001 "circle" * <call 1>;
+2002 <delay 2> "cross" * <call 2>;


   Note also that <Delay> must be pretty much the first thing in the item 
if it's used in an item, it's one of those lovely old pieces of code that 
harks from antiquity and using it any other way is fraught with 
unpredictability.

   For John's controlled feedback delay example the <Delay> keywords should 
be in the items displaying the feedback like this:

<ep> <nfb> <s 1> <delay 50> <eop>
$
0 "instructions" <bu 1000>;
~1 <bi 4, lastXT .gt. 0>;
~2 <bi 5, lastXT .eq. -4000>;
3 <delay 3> "wrong" <return>;
4 <delay 3> "correct" <return>;
5 <delay 3> "too long" <return>;
~1000;
$
+1001 "circle" * <call 1>;
+2001 "circle" * <call 1>;

   Not that I think a there's a machine in existence today that can't 
prepare stock feedback in two ticks...
