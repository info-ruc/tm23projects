Hi,

I guess this is a basic question. I have read Nan Jiang's instructions on data
analysis, but it is not working for me. I get .ism  and .das files that have
not RT's or %error information (see example below). The file also says that I
have 0 subjects. It's like the program does not have access to the data I
collected somehow!
 In the program ANALYZE I entered my item file (.rtf) in the first line and then
the .spc file in the second line as requested.  I have made sure that the .azk
file, the item file, the .spc file and the application Analyze were all in the
same folder.

I probably forgot a silly little detail but can't figure out which one. Any
ideas? Thanks in advance.

Nathalie
