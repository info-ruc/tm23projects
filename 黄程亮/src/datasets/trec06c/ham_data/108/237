Hi everybody,

I am preparing a experiment on a notebook. In each trial of the experiment, two
visual stimuli, a cross and a circle, will be shown sequentially. There are
four combinations, including that a cross is shown first and then a circle is
shown; a circle first and then a cross; 2 circle are shown sequentially; 2
cross shown sequentially. Each stimulus would last for 75ms, and ISI would be
varied from 500ms, 300ms, 100ms, 50ms, 10ms. The instruction given to the
subject is that when he see cross, he need to press A; when he see circle, he
need to press L. A correct repsone for each trial including 2 presses which are
in corect order. We try to write the program like this:

 

 <n 12> <g 2> <s 12> <fbl +1><azk> <cr> <fd 0> <t 4000> <id "keyboard"> <dbc
255255255><dwc 0><vm 1024 768 768 16 0>


$ 
0 <umr><mr "+Space"><umpr> <umnr>

<ln -1><bmp> "press two pics";

0 <ln -1> <bmp> "see x press A";

0 <ln -1><bmp> "see O press L"; 

0 <ln -1><bmp> "space";




250 <ms% 500> /; 
$ 

+1 * <ms% 75> <bmp> "cross" /* <ms% 500> <bmp> "white"/* <ms% 75> <bmp>
"circle"/<mpr "+A"><mnr "+L">/<cfb ¡§correct¡¨> <nfbt> <wfb "wrong">;

 

-2 *<mpr "+A"><mnr "+L">/<cfb ¡§correct¡¨> <nfbt> <wfb "wrong">;

 

 

However, there are several problems. First, when subject press the first
button,
he need to wait for a while before he press the second button though i have set
<fd 0>. Then the RT of subject would not accurate. Second, For ISI is 500ms
like the above, the subject may press the button once he see the first stimulus
before the second stimulus is shown. But, we cannot spilt the 2 stimulus in
each
trial into 2 lines. That is write the programe like this :

 

 

+1 * <ms% 75> <bmp> "cross"/<ms% 500> <bmp> "white"//<mpr "+A"><mnr "+L">/<cfb
¡§correct¡¨> <nfbt> <wfb "wrong">;

 

-2 *<ms% 75> <bmp> "circle"/<mpr "+A"><mnr "+L">/<cfb ¡§correct¡¨> <nfbt> <wfb
"wrong">;

 

Because we use five ISI: 500ms, 300ms,, 100ms, 50ms, 10ms. For the short ISI,
like 10ms, if we split the 2 stimulus into 2 lines, the subject would not have
enough time to repsond.

 

The third problem is the feedback. If the subject press incorrect button for
the
first stimulus, but he press correct button for the second stimulus, a feedback
"wrong" would be shown followed by a feedback "correct". A correct reponse for
each trial involves 2 presses in correct order. And the condition just
described is a wrong repsonse instead of a wrong and then correct response. 

 

I know what I said is a bit complicated, hope you will undersatnd what I said.
I
don't know how to use DMDX to write a programme that can record RT for 2
responses in each trial.

 

Thanks,

Kevin
