            CALL FOR PAPERS: 3rd International Workshop on 
         AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION: TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
                 http://www.autodiff.org/iccs06/
     at ICCS 2006, University of Reading, UK, May 28-31, 2006.

Derivatives, also known as sensitivities, are ubiquitous in various
areas of computational science and their accurate and efficient
evaluation is often indispensable for a wide variety of numerical
algorithms. Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a technology for
automatically augmenting computer programs, including arbitrarily
complex simulations, with statements for the computation of derivatives.
In contrast to traditional numerical differentiation based on divided
differences, AD provides guaranteed accuracy and computational
efficiency. 

The primary goal of this session is to provide a venue for computational
scientists to report on recent advances in tool design as well as
innovative uses of AD tools and AD-related methodologies.

Authors are invited to submit original and unpublished papers in all
areas of AD with an emphasis on tool development and successful
applications. Refer to the workshop's website for further instructions.
