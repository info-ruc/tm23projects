Jacques (and the reliable_computing list),

Thank you for your explanation.

I have made the archives available, at the link:

   http://interval.louisiana.edu/reliable_computing.archive/

(If you use the simple link

   http://interval.louisiana.edu

then you get my personal home page, upon which there is also
a link to the reliable_computing archives.)

When you go to that web address, you will obtain a raw list
of all the files in the archive.  These files are of the form

   reliable_computing.YYMM

For example, 

   reliable_computing.0209 

contains the archive from September, 2002.

I note that, with this method, all of these archives are 
accessible PUBLICLY;  that is, anyone with access to the web
has access to these archives.  If anyone on this list objects
to that, please inform me immediately.

Sincerely,

Baker
