FUZZ-IEEE 2007
IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems
July 23-26 2007, London, England
http://www.fuzzieee2007.org/

CALL FOR PAPERS

FUZZ-IEEE, the Annual IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems,
is one of the premier international conferences in the field. The
2007 conference will cover the whole range of research and
applications in fuzzy systems and soft computing, including:

Fuzzy control and robotics, sensors, fuzzy hardware,
  fuzzy architectures
Soft computing and hybrid systems - adaptive, hierarchical,
  evolutionary, neural and nature-inspired systems
Fuzzy image, speech and signal processing, vision and multimedia
Fuzzy data analysis - clustering and classifiers, pattern recognition,
  bio-informatics
Mathematical foundations of fuzzy systems
Fuzzy AI - knowledge discovery, learning, reasoning, agents,
  knowledge representation
Fuzzy information processing - information extraction and retrieval,
  fusion, text mining
Computing with words granular computing, rough sets,
  fuzzy human computer interaction
Fuzzy systems and the internet - semantic web, ontologies, searching,
  networks and routing, intrusion detection
Fuzzy optimization and design, decision analysis and support
Industrial, financial and medical applications

FUZZ-IEEE 2007 will be held in London, England, one of the most
vibrant cities in Europe with a wealth of cultural and tourist
attractions. The conference venue is Imperial College, one of the
UK's top universities.

A full programme of tutorials, specialist workshops and panel
sessions together with keynote talks from leading researchers and
regular oral and poster presentations will be organised.

CONFERENCE VENUE

The Conference venue will be Imperial College of Science, Technology
and Medicine which is an independent constituent part of the
University of London.

Imperial College was established in 1907 in London's scientific and
cultural heartland in South Kensington. Imperial College is one of
the world's most prestigious Universities Nobel prize winners and
many famous scientists. The list of the Imperial college Nobel Prize
can be found in http://www.ic.ac.uk/P455.htm

Imperial college is located in South Kensington which is London's
scientific and cultural heartland and one of London's finest
locations and central to London's famous attractions and sights as
it is adjacent to such landmarks as The Royal Albert Hall and the
Science, Natural History and Victoria & Albert Museums, with
Buckingham Palace, Piccadilly Circus, Harrods, Hyde Park and the
shopping area at Oxford street just a short walk away. Few locations
offer such a diversity of attractions and breadth of culture with
museums, art galleries, theatres, concert halls and historical
places of interest to visit. The conference is surrounded by many
restaurants serving all tastes.
