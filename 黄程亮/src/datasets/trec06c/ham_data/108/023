Dear Friends, 

GOOD NEWS: INTERVAL SESSION APPROVED 
The conference organizers have approved our proposal for a special 
interval-related session at the 

Second International Conference on Fuzzy
Sets and Soft Computing in Economics and Finance FSSCEF 2006
June 28- July 01, 2006, St. Petersburg, Russia
http://fsscef.narod.ru/index.html
(see also info attached at the end of this message;
call for papers can also be viewed at 
http://www.cs.utep.edu/interval-comp/spb06.pdf). 

SCOPE OF THE INTERVAL SESSION
In financial and economic situations, most parameters are known
with uncertainty. It is therefore important to take this uncertainty
into account when processing financial and economic data.

In some cases, the only information we have is
the bounds for a parameter, i.e., we only know the interval that is
guaranteed to contain the actual value of this parameter. To handle
such interval uncertainty, we must use interval computations
techniques specifically designed for handling this type of uncertainty.

In many real-life situations, instead of (or in addition to) an
interval guaranteed to contain the value of the parameter, we have
a nested family of intervals which contain this parameter with different
degree of certainty -- i.e., in effect, we have a fuzzy set. It is well
known that often, one of the most efficient ways of processing such
fuzzy data is to process the corresponding intervals layer-by-layer.

The proposed session which cover:
* applications of interval computation techniques to finance and
  economics problems
* interval computation techniques which are of potential use to
  finance and economic problems
* inter-relation between interval and fuzzy techniques, especially
  in view of application to finance and economic problems
