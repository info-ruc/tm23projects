Dear Friends, 

Practially every year, there is a special session at the annual NAFIPS
meeting devoted to the relation between intervals and fuzzy, it will be
great to have one in 2006 as well. If you are interested in
participation, please send me your name email and if possible
approximate title. The deadline is in January but the earlier we send in
the preliminary proposal the better. 

NAFIPS is IEEE-sponsored, so publications appear in IEEE electronic
database to which many of us have easy access thorugh their universities
or via individual IEEE membership. 

NAFIPS is a reasonably small conference, usually having plenty of time
for discussions both during the talks and outside the talks, it is
always very inspiring.

VENUE
You are cordially invited to participate in NAFIPS'06,
to be held at Concordia University in Montreal. Montreal is a vibrant
multi-cultural metropolis boasting a unique blend of European and
North American influences, with plenty of opportunities to dine
and shop.

AIMS AND SCOPE
NAFIPS'06 aims to bring together
researchers, engineers and practitioners to present the latest
achievements and innovations in the area of fuzzy information
processing, to discuss thought-provoking developments and
challenges, to consider potential future directions. Topics of
interest include, but are not limited to:
Fuzzy sets methodology /Algorithms/Mathematics
Bioinformatics / human-centric computing
Neuro-fuzzy systems / Hybrid architectures
Web intelligence / semantic webs
Computational Intelligence/ Uncertainty management
Computer vision / Pattern Recognition/Image processing
Software Engineering / Intelligent Agents
Control / Robotics / Adaptive systems / Learning
Intelligent data analysis / Data Mining / Databases
Applications / Computational experiments / Case studies

SPECIAL SESSIONS
Proposals for special sessions focusing on
fundamental theories and innovative applications of fuzzy sets are
welcome. Submission of proposals to Special Sessions Chair should
include a short description of the session and a list of potential
contributors. Special sessions will be open to all participants.

BEST STUDENT PAPER CONTEST
To identify and recognize
accomplishments of students, the best student papers will be
recognized with a special award. To qualify, a student or a group
of students must be the primary author(s) of the paper. The paper
will be judged based on both manuscript content and presentation.
Awards will be presented at the banquet.

EXTENDED ABSTRACT SUBMISSION
Extended abstract submissions should be a maximum of
one page. The abstract should briefly describe the problem being
addressed, the approach used to solve the problem, and how the
proposed method differs from others in the literature.
