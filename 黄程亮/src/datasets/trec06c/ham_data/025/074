Hi Folks,
  I'm not actually subscribed to the Handyboard list as Fred is traveling an
unable to add me to the list. But I was hoping someone could take a moment to
clear up my confusion on why the documentation occasionally refers to the E1,
while the parts list has only the A1. Are they interchangeable, is one
preferable to the other? I'm about to order the microcontroller and I want to
make sure I get the right one.
  On a similar note, I'm having trouble finding the LCD display. I tried Newark,
Allied, Digikey and Jameco to no avail.
  Thanks for your help. Please respond directly to me since I'm not on the list.
  Thanks,
    Chris Prosser
