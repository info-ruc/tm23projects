Welllllllll.. I wouldn't *recommend* it persay, however, the 6811 port of
the GCC compiler is free.  It works, I am running a program I compiled
with it right now in a terminal window.  At work, we use the Cosmic C
compiler for our 6811 based systems.  This compiler is amazing.  I simply
would never ever write assembly code again if I were using this compiler
at home; it easily outcompiles my ability to generate assembly code.

gcc-6811-fsf.tar.gz and gcc-2.6.3.tar.gz.

You also might search www.eg3.com, they maintain links to a variety of
developement tools.  I have little doubt that you will find one for
*shudder* DOS, or even *spit* *spit* Windows.
