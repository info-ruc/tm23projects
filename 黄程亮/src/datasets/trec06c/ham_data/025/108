Hi Everyone:

I am trying out the infra red emission and detection with 
the Handy Board. I have succeeded in the emission part 
but the detection circuit is not working. I know that 
the emitter LED is fine , with the help of Radio Shack
Infrared sensor card. can anyone give me any hints as 
to how to get the sharp detector to see the radiations 
or maybe do it with the help of any other detector also.

Thanks a lot.

Bye,

Raj
