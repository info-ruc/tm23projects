phillip:
     Pine 8 for the L293D is "Motor Power."  There are two ways to get to
this.  1) Pull the chip from the socket, lift the pin so it points straight
up, then wire-wrap a new supply wire to this pin.  Or scratch the trace
leading to pin 8 U11 and apply power to J13.  I have forgotten what the Max
Voltage that the 293 can take is, but it is above 12V I'm sure.

Good Luck
Pherd
