Can someone point me in the direction of using a 20 x 4 LCD=2E  I saw a
reference on the HB website about recompiling the IC source with a
command line switch specifying the LCD dimensions=2E  What do need to
recompile, only the P_code=2Es19 file??  How do I accomplish this???

Any help or suggestions appreciated=2E
