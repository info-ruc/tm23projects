Good Day,</P>=0D
<P>&nbsp;</P>=0D
<P>My name is Mr. Ali Raza Khan, a banker here in U. A.E. I write you this =
proposal in good faith as a brother, believing that you will not betray me<=
BR>
regarding the information I am about to reveal to you.In 2002 a Crude Oil d=
ealer Late Mr. Barid Emad, made a (Fixed deposit) for 60 calendar months, v=
alued at<BR>
US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million, Five hundred Thousand US Dollars) with=
 my bank. I was his account officer before I rose to the position of manage=
r. </P>=0D
<P>&nbsp;</P>=0D
<P>The maturity date for this deposit contract was 20th of August 2005. I h=
ave tried my possible best to locate Mr. Emad to notify him about this, but=
 all my efforts proved abortive. I later discovered that Mr. Emad, his wife=
 and only daughter were among the victims of bomb blast during the war in I=
raq. Unfortunately, he has no other living relatives to inherit this fund. =
Now, a new Financial Law, which takes effect in two month=C3=83=C2=A2=C3=82=
=C2=80=C3=82=C2=99s time, stipulates that any bank account more<BR>
than $5,000,000.00 [Five Million US Dollars] will be investigated and the b=
ank shall produce the account owner for clearance. </P>=0D
<P>&nbsp;</P>=0D
<P>This is a Government measure to check money laundering. If I do not find=
 a way to move this money out of the country immediately, in two month=C3=
=83=C2=A2=C3=82=C2=80=C3=82=C2=99s time, it might be reverted to Government=
 treasury because the bank management cannot provide Mr. Emad since he is n=
ow late. I am seeking your co-operation to present you as the next of kin t=
o the account since you are a foreigner, so that my bank head quarters will=
 release the funds to you. It is only a foreigner can claim the funds in th=
e account.&nbsp; </P>=0D
<P>&nbsp;</P>=0D
<P>There is no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under a legi=
timate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Let me kno=
w how much percent you will take, so that both parties will be satisfied. C=
ontact me as soon as you receive this message for further details. </P>=0D
<P>Please, treat as top secret, I am the only person having this informatio=
n. </P>=0D
<P>&nbsp;</P>=0D
<P>Regards,</P>=0D
