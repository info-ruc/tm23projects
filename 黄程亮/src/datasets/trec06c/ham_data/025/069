If you get your hands on a Nintendo power glove you'll find some in the
fingers of the glove.
That's what I've been told!

>Hi all,

>I'm looking for these bend sensors described in the "Mobile Robots" book,
they look fairly interesting to implement bumpers or to use in wall
following activities but I can't find them anywhere.

>According to the book  p.117 "bend sensors are very inexpensive, under one
dollar". So far I found them on only one place on the web and they are
charging $10 a piece! I called AGE (the distributor listed in the yellow
page in "Mobile Robots" as the source for this hardware) and they don't know
what I'm talking about ;^(.

That's great. I'll make sure to build a web page with schematics and
software when I have a working version of my robot  to help whoever come
after me!
