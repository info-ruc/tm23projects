Hi,
I'd like to use the line follower C routines included with the handyboard
software. What type of sensors do I need, where can I find them, and are there
schematics for connecting them to the handyboard?
Also, I would like my handyboard to control two 30 VDC ( ~3A) motors. I know
that WIRZ electronics has H-Bridge circuits, but does anyone have any
recommendations on which module to buy? 
Thanks for your help
Dave.
