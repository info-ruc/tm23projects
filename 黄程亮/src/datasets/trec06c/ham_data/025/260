Hi Dave,
 I have a line tracker kit and also the IRPD infrared proximity detector
kits from Lynxmotion constructed but do not know how to connect them to the
handyboard.
I contacted Jim Frye with Lynxmotion but he said he was not familiar with
the handyboard.
Please let me know your connections and possibly share some code if you
have any success.
				
					Thanks
					Terry Gathright
