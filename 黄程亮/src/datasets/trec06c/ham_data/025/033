Howdy folks-

I've got a quick question for  anyone out there have any experience with =
power distribution systems using multiple batteries...

If I have say six [more or less identical] batteries... am I better off =
to run them all at once (in whatever config I need) or to only switch on =
the ones I need at the moment? In other words, let's say I need 12 volts =
for several hours and each battery can supply an amp-hour.. is it better =
to run all the batteries in parallel at the same time and let them run =
down together, or to first switch one on then the next and so on as =
required? Is there a practical advantage to either method (other than =
the obvious one of accidental power drain in one battery not draining =
them all)? Are there any good references on power distribution I should =
look at???

Thanks for any insight you all can offer!
