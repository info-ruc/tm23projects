When I download the pcode file using either HBDL or DL the pcode itself
is loaded successfully but I then get an error from both programs saying
the config register is set to 0xFF=2E  I retried several times but the config
register always reads 0xFF=2E  I am using an E2 (2k eeprom) version of the
HC11=2E  I tried using the -eeprom (Burn Eeprom) switch but got the same
result=2E  What could be keeping the config register from being reset=2E  I used
this processor in a previous project if that matters=2E=2E=2E
Any suggestions=2E=2E=2E I'm stuck=2E=2E=2E
