When I first read the above, I thought to myself "wait, was it just the
source code? Or was it everything?" -- Looking up the license again,
it does indeed seem to be EVERYTHING. So according to the license, in
fact one may not let people even log in to the system if they are not
a license holder. How sad. :(
