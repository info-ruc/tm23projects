 hello

       can someone please tell me what does the following command line mean?

       bit_set(0x0e, 1 << (4 + motor));

       i know that 0x0e refers to memory location $0E but how does bit_set
       work? is it similar to poke? and more importantly, what operation
       does '1 << (4 + motor)' perform?

       any help will be appreciated. thanks.
 

 edmund
