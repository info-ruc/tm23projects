Hi

Most of the IR LED's sold at Radio Shack are the 840-880 nm wavelenght type.
The Sharp tin can requires the 940 nm wavelength IR beam if my memory serves
me right, it also requires to be modulated at 38 or 40 kHz depending on the
model. This 38 or 40 kHz should  also be modulated on and off to get a
response from the sensor.

I currently have the IRPD http://www.robotstore.com/ hooked up to my Handy
Board  and have good results.
If you go that way let me know and I 'll send you some code in c.

I hope that helps and correct me if I'm wrong!
