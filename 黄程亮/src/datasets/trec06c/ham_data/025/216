Ja,
	I could not tell you for the life of me what 'type' f a HB it is,
but I remember someone once telling me that you could just remove one of
the pins from the driver chip instead. This method would be less final
(ie, just bend the lead up and if yyou decide to change it you could just
bend it down), but again, for the life of me, I cannot remember which pin!
Check the schematic, it should be pretty obvious. Or follow traces on the
HB.....
