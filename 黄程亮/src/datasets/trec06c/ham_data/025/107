I picked up a 20x4 LCD from B. G. Micro (see their on-line catalog at
http://www.bgmicro.com/prodlit.htm and view page 2 - the LCD is the one in
the upper right at $8.95, part number LCD1002).

For 2x16, it will work just plugging into the HB.  I poked memory locations
related to the display size and got 2x20 going (a dirty hack, but I did not
have to recompile the p-code assembly).

I do get one problem - every once in a while the displayed text will wrap
to the location following the flashing heart.  I don't know if this is a
code issue or something with the LCD.

If anyone knows of the 20x4 P-code, let me know.  I remember reading
someone had done this, but cannot find the info any more.
