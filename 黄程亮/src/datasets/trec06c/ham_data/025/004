I would like to have my HB controlling a stepper motor.

It's a 4-phase unipolar permanent magnet motor.
The names of the inputs are like this:

1 - stepper phase #1
2-    ''     ''   #2
3-    ''     ''   #3
4 -   ''     ''   #4
5 - stepper common #1,3
6 - stepper common #2,4

I don't have any experience in stepper motor, can anybody give me some clues on
how to use it with the HB?

Keith
