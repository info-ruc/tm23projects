I just did this.  

First you need the source code for IC, the compiler, and apparently
Unix since the source code requires
some pre-processing and the script to do that works
under Unix (which I don't have).

An alternative method requires the source code, the
*.s19 file and the 68HC11 pink book and some determination (I have
that).  I edited the *.s19 file and replaced the appropriate numbers
(4 or 5 places) to let the program work with a 4 by 20 display. 

Due to the way that the display maps the memory to
the displayed lines you have to print:
"The first line      The third line
The second line      The fourth line"
to get the proper order of the display.

(maybe I could have just asked Newton Labs but
that would have be too easy....)
