Hi,
acroname has the sonar modules for $45.00.

to check how it was "recommended" to do it with the Polaroid OEM kit (It's
at
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/software/sonar.ht
ml). this seems pretty straightforward to do but I'd like to use 2 sonars,
not just one, to give my robot a more stereoscopic view of the world.

lot of connections between the two sonars board: basically there is only
the need for one additional pin.

necessary?)

sonar_init and having a sample_right and sample_left functions with the
only difference being the bit_set(0x1008, 0x20) replaced by bit_set(0x1008,
0x08). As long as I don't use both sonar at the same time I'm fine right?

I'm not sure about is the use of D3. If I understand the MC68HC11 reference
manual correctly I can just use it the same way D4 and D5 are. D2 is
apparently unusable as an output in the mode the SPI is in, but D3 should
be possible to setup (I guess I'm going to reinstall monsterscope on my
NeXTCube tomorrow to check my assumption!).

And talking about cost, does anybody knows a cheap supplier for these
sonars? Wirz Electronics want $50 for one and $94 for two... And it's $99
for 2 direct from Polaroid. Anybody cheaper (and no, I don't have a
hackable Polaroid camera at home ;^)?
