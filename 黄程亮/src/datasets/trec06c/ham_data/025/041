Hi all,

I'm still amazed with this Handyboard!  I had some free time 
to play this weekend and hooked up a Servo motor for the 
first time.  It was a small futaba that I got from B&G or 
Electronics Goldmine (I can't remember which).

Anyway, I have a few questions though...

Programming Question:

Q1)  The servo_deg() function requires a float.  How do I 
get it to use an integer if I want to put it in a loop and 
use an integer variable?

Q2) Is it normal for the servo to 'jitter' back and forth 
slightly for about a second after doing a servo_deg()?

Thanks!
Gerald
