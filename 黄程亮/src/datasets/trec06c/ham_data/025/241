Hello, all:

<DELURK>

    I've been following this list for some time now, but since I didn't have
an HB, I didn't contribute to the discussion.

    Now, I've just ordered my HB because I plan to start building. But I
have a question...

    I have a model police car, 1:12 scale R/C. I thought that it would be
neat to have the car "patrol" an area containing other R/C cars, and
determine which ones were "speeding". Obviously K-55 doesn't make a radar
gun 1:12 size, so I gave it some thought. Why not use sonar; a Polaroid-type
module, but smaller?

    I figure that the speed of the car can be derived from the distance from
the police car to the perp as measured by two consecutive samples at a known
time interval. Some quick math should give me ds/dt, distance over time.
Exceeding a pre-set limit would trigger the autonomous searching.

    Do you think that this is do-able? Comments welcome.
