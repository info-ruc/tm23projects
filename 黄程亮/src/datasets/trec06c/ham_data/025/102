I'd appreciate mucho any help and ideas you all have

I am building my HB, finally got the caps and crystal osc. working, and
ran the HBDL program to download. All good and fine. I go off and solder
in the transparent latch, and while doing so I knock the board. I go back
and check that to see what problems I've created:

pin 26 gives +5volts
pin 5 gives me a 2MHz signal (about 700mV pp), and 2.8V

but -> pin 1 is giving me 2.85V && The Batt LED will not go off && I can
       no longer get into bootstrap mode :( 

Did I blow my 6811? What other things should I check? the only other stuff
I have installed is the memory chips

Thank you very much
