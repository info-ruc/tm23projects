im working on a project for school, a digital oscilloscope for your pc, 
but im running into some trouble concerning the ADC part of the project, 
specially with the noise introduced by the ADC itself to the signal 
being digitized, (im using a Harris HI3318 for each channel), in the 
manual and data sheets you have separate grounds for digital and 
analogue supplies, yet in the diagrams i`ve seen concerning adc`s they 
all have a common supply, provided they use some capacitors for  
filtering (i supposse). If anyone has some advice concerning this matter 
please repply at:

bernardo72@hotmail.com

PS: I know it has nothing to do with the handyboard, but ive read a 
couple of messages from people that are very good at electronics and 
maybe they can lend a hand.
thanks again
