There was (is) a thread going on about someone violating DMR's
copyright. He posted an article in the thread himself, of which
I would like to present you the headers:

I have read about this happening before, but this time I witnessed
it myself. How it it possible that the very person who brought us
Unix and the C language, apparently doesn't believe enough in his
own design to use it as a client OS and uses this sorry excuse of
an OS instead? I think he really underestimates the example he is
setting with this. :(
He is still one of my heroes, but I am not very pleased right now.
I do consider this post advocacy, so I didn't cc DMR himself. But
it would be nice if he would join the forum and reply on this.

HAND,
