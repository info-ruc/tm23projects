Hi all,

I have writen a code, when i download it i received following message.
"c:\ic\libs\speed.icb(1): Code and data segments collide --
overflow of 681 bytes"
After that I reduced the size of code and downloaded it, It was
successfull. I got following message.
Downloading 5978 bytes (addresses 8000-9759): 5978 loaded
Downloading 5082 bytes (addresses 975A-AB33): 5082 loaded
Downloading 19 bytes (addresses AB34-AB46): 19 loaded
Code loaded.

Can any body tell me what is the maximum size of code i can
download. From where I can find out size of my code. What is the meaning
of above three lines where it says 5978,5082 and 19 bytes loaded.
Does the above information means that my code is about 11k.
Is it possible to load larger size of code from this.
Any help would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance.



Sincerely,
Javaid Iqbal
