The servos which I've been using can run at two different power levels...
I think they are 7.5 and 5 volts.  I found that if I powered the servo
directly off the battery (stupid, yes), the servo would over-correct and
jitter.  But if I powered if off of one of the digital inputs, which I
think provide 5 volts, the servo settled down and behaved properly.
Messing around with sonar a sonar ranger also seemed to indicate that
servos are sensative to power fluctuations and I think the regulated
power of the digital inputs is more stable, too.
