Subject: Handy board questions


	I am writing to you to let you know I have used your web-page. and
there is a lot of information that I have used.  I do have a particular
quesion, if you have time to reply.  My question and problem is with the
sonar.  I am currently testing the sonar using the handy board.  I am
using the set up that you have on your website.  

	The problem is I am getting readings from the handy board, which
is from the sonar.  The reading I am getting are ranging from -25000 to
+25000.  Some of the sample readings that I am getting are as follows;
200, 1400, 1800, 5000, 12000, 2400, 3000, -500, -3000, -14000, -24000,
-500, 13000, 23000.  The reading that I am getting are ranging from a
-25000 to a +25000.  I have tried this test with nothing in front of the
sonar for 30 feet, and I have also tried testing it with a book 3 inches
in front of it.  Even with the different tests, the readings seem
similiar.  

I don't know if this is normal, but it does seem like my data is
not ideal.

	Another problem I am having is the connection from the Polaroid
9-pin Connector to the 6500 Series Sonar Ranging Module.  I am using a
Polaroid ribbon wire, between these two.  The problem is, the ribbon is
bending a lot and the connection is not that good.  The ribbon wire keeps
coming out of the female connector.  Have you ever came across this
problem or has any of your email list servers, and how did they solve this
problem.
