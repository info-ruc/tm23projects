Hi all,

Electronics Goldmine has some notebook pc IRDA ports for $2!
<http://www.goldmine-elec.com/Specials.htm>

I think it would be Great to use a couple of these to get 2 Handyboards 
to talk with eachother.  Or, get one handyboard to talk with my Notebook
PC (which already has an IRDA port).

Has anyone done something like this?  
Does anyone know anything about these IRDA units or how difficult
it may be to control/interface them?

Thanks!
Gerald
