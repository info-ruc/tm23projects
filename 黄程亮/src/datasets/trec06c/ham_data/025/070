This is correct, although the bend sensors aren't all that great. I've got
the glove and the accuracy isn't very much, about the best you can expect is
what they've got from the glove , ie 4 different bend positions. But if this
is enough for your task then a $5 surplus glove from somewhere would be
ideal
