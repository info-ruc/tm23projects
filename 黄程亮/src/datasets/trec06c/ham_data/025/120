HI,
Currently, I'm using 2 dc motors to drive my robot. The voltage of the
motor is 12v rated. and the rated current is 300mA. These motors are
directly plug into the HD for use. As
a result, the robot cannot travelled fast and sometimes halt suddenly due
to the insufficient voltage . How should I supply a 12v souce to such motor
which 12V on the HD ? 

I am trying to use this method :
Firstly, I connect both the motor's wires to a external driver IC 298.
Next, I extend out the wire  from the IC 298 to the Motor Port 2 and 3. I
supply the voltage source using external alkaline battery of 12 V (Each
battery is 1.5) to the Driver IC298. Is there any danger that will damage
the HD or the Motor itself for such connection ?

Please help. I really need this information urgently. Thank you very much.

rgds,
phillip
