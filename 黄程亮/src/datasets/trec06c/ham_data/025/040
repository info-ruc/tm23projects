Hi All:

I am new to the handyboard list as I just got my handyboard.
I am trying to implement obstacle detection using the IR 
sensors. my question is that, if I want to have more than 
one ir emitter LED, ( to find out the direction of the
obstacle) , do I need to have as many detectors also,( the
sharp IS1U60 chip) or the one which is already there on the
handyboard will do? If I need more, how should I connect
them and also, how should I connect the extra IR output
LED's? I hope someone can help me with that.

Thanks.

Rajbala
