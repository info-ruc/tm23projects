Thanks to all who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I'm still not
able to get the nameserver thing to work.  Most of the trouble is due to
my inexperience, but I'm going to keep trying. Using Mothra when I try
to locate a URL that isn't a file on my local machine  I get the error:
cs: can't translate address.  Maybe by looking at how things work under
Linux I can get Plan 9 working.

Under Linux I have a file called /etc/route.conf.  In that file there is
one line that says:
        default xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
Xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx is the ip address of my gateway.
I also have a file called /resolv.conf. In that file there are 3 lines :

        nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
I have the ip addresses of the nameservers, but not what they are called
(like caribou.stanford.edu)

My understanding of how all this works is pretty dim, but I think if the
address, or name can't be found on my machine (it never can), the
default is to send it to the gateway.  Anyway it works ok under Linux.
Is it possible to accomplish this with Plan 9?

Michael
