Hi Will:

What you say might be the reason for my problem hence I bought a
matched IR emitter and detector pair from Radio Shack and tried the
same thing. Here again, the emitter is sending the signal but
the detector is not able to see it. I tried connecting the receiver
to a digital port directly without any resistor and analysing the
input from the port by using the digital(int) function. It did not
show any level change. Basically, I am trying to 
implement something similar to the REC 80 routines by Danny Negro
and Max Davies' work. I hope to be able to transmit the codes
from the IR transmitter of one handyboard and have another HB
receive and decode the signals. I even tried Sriram's code  (I got
it from the HB mailing list archives ) which
sends out a signal similar to that sent out by the sony remote but
the Sharp Chip was still not able to receive/decode it. 
Another question I have is, if I want my handyboard to send signals
in different directions, do I need to have as many detectors as
emitters or one detector will do?

Thanks for your help.

Raj.
