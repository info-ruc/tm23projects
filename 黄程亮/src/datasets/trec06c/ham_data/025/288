To Integrate Assembly Code into a "C" Program

The variables declared here become globals in C.
A simple example to double a number entered from a =

"C" program, multiply it in assembly code, =

then displayed on the Handy Board LCD display,
will be explained here . =

The process is as follows:  write the assembly code, =

assemble the ASM file and convert it to an "ICB" file,
add "ICB" to lib_hb.lis file, and call the variable or
subroutine from the MAIN "C" file. For Example,
the name of the file is ASMTEST and the extensions =

determine the type of data on files.
ASMTEST.ASM    ; a file written in assembly code
ASMTEST.ICB    ; a file that was assembled into "S" =

               ; records.
ASMTEST.C      ; "IC" MAIN function program
LIB_HB.LIS     ; list of files to be executed
AS11_IC        ; a batch file that assembles, creates  =

       ; lables definitions of entry points and C variables

For this example the commands were as follows:
AS11_IC ASMTEST  ;this batch assembles the ASMTEST.ASM
file and outputs ASMTEST.ICB. The following programs
were tested for the example multiply by 2 and display:

* file: asmtest.asm, first assembly file to be tested 29SEP98*/
* Sample icb file */
* origin for module and variables */
#include "6811regs.asm"
            ORG      MAIN_START
* program to return twice the argument passed to us */
subroutine_double:
            ASLD        ; shift left accumulator to multiply by 2
            RTS          : return of subroutine =

   while(1)
    {      =

         printf("asmtest # =3D %d\n",double(5)); /*assembly subroutine*/
     }
    } =

*******************END OF LIB_HB.LIS***************
To finish this procedure run "IC"  which automatically
downloads and executes the MAIN() , the turn =

the Handy Board "OFF" and then "ON". =

"The asmtest # =3D 10" should be displayed on the =

Handy Board's LCD screen.

Good luck
