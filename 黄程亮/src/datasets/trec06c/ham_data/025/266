If you don't plan to be a domain-level server yourself, you may
want to piggy-back off whatever domain-level server does exist
for your network. What I have in mine is:

	dom=
		ns=cilantro.stanford.edu
		ns=cassandra.stanford.edu
		ns=caribou.stanford.edu
	dom=cilantro.stanford.edu ip=171.64.7.99
	dom=cassandra.stanford.edu ip=171.64.7.77
	dom=caribou.stanford.edu ip=171.64.7.55

The above gives me full DNS capability off of the Stanford DNS system.
Of course, this also means that if their DNS has a bad cache or 
something, I won't be able to do anything about it.

And, as was shown earlier, you can have specific dom=<nameserver.domain.name>
entries for specific domains, or have a 'dom=<blank>' entry with a list of
the root-level DNS servers.
