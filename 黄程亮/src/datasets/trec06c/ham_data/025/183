Hi Ronald!

Ok - my HB is working now. I got the right 1233-10 (10 means 10% of 5v -
reset
is going up on 4.5v). This seem to work better. Second thing is the 350ms
delay
seem to be necessary in normal reset.

The second thing was that the power supply on the board was relativly 
unstable (dropped when i touched with an digital probe) till i finished the
last
step adding the L1 - 1 uH - iron core inductor. Since then the whole thing
works
stable!

Good luck in trying your board getting to work!

Bye
Bernd
