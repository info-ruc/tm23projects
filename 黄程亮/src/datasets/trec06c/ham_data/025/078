There was a guy on the HB list a few months back offering to sell bend
sensors for a reasonable price.  I figured that if he's into robotics,
then he's probably one of the good guys.  I took a chance and sent him a
few bucks, but I haven't received the sensors yet.

If he proves to be trustworthy and has more sensors to sell, then I'll
let you know.  If he doesn't deliver soon, then I'll post his name and
tell everyone that he's a bum!

Wendy Parson,            If you steal from one author, it's plagiarism;
Will Bain,                       if you steal from many, it's research.
