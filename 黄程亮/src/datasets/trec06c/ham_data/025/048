Hi all,

I'm looking for these bend sensors described in the "Mobile Robots" book, they look fairly interesting to implement bumpers or to use in wall following activities but I can't find them anywhere.

According to the book  p.117 "bend sensors are very inexpensive, under one dollar". So far I found them on only one place on the web and they are charging $10 a piece! I called AGE (the distributor listed in the yellow page in "Mobile Robots" as the source for this hardware) and they don't know what I'm talking about ;^(.

Help!

-- Eric

PS: Thanks for all your help. This mailing list has a tremendous impact on my robot! I can ask questions and I usually got multiple helpful answers. That's great. I'll make sure to build a web page with schematics and software when I have a working version of my robot  to help whoever come after me!
