Well, I'm cheap ;^) I'm using the free version.

I might be lured into buying the commercial version: I'd sure love to have structs and multidimensional vectors. I think I will miss function pointers...

Is there any source coming with the commercial version? I'm not interested in the source of the code running on the host, but I'd sure like to have the source of the stuff running on the handy board, the infamous pcode_hb.asm.
