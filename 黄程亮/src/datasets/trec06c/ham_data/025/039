I was wondering if it's ok to use another voltage monitor such as Zetex's
ZM33064C (5vcc, 4=2E6v thresh, sinks 60mA) in place of the Dallas
DS1233?
Also, is it possible to modify the LCD routines to work with displays other
than 2x16=2E  Specifically I have an Optrex 20x4 that I would like to use=2E =20=


suggestions?
-Drew
