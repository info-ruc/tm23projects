An occasional sporadic reading is normal and can best be handled by
returning the median of three readings.  Very noisy sonar data like
yours might be attributable to noisy power to the board, a weak
connection, or running motors, etc. at the same time.  The Polaroid
manual says that it's a good idea to make sure there are no other
electromechanical components operating while listening for a ping. 
Also, make sure you soldered the correct capacitor into the C7 position
on the sonar module board (see the HB web page) and that your solder
joints are clean.

The solution that worked best for me was to replace the female flat flex
connector on the sonar module board with .100" female header strips--a
1x4 and a 1x5 superglued together.  I glued up a 9-pin male header plug
to match, and used rainbow ribbon cable to connect the sonar module to
my custom dual sonar interface board (with the six diodes and the
resistor on it).  I also doubled up on the power and ground wires to
ensure adequate current flow.  It works great.  Anyone who wants more
details should feel free to e-mail me directly.  Good luck!

Wendy Parson,             If you can find something everyone agrees on,
