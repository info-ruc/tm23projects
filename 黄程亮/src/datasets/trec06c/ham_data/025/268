That ought to work fine, provided the cop is almost directly in front of
or behind the "perp"; then no correction for angle is necessary.  The
Polaroid sonar detects objects within about a 10-degree cone.

It might still work if the sonar is angled across the "roadway", but it
would take some careful calibration:  You could estimate the relative
bearing of the perp vehicle based on the amount of time for it to cross
into and then out of the 10-degree cone (you'd need to keep sampling at
a high rate).  That, along with a couple of range readings and a bunch
of trigonometry, ought to give you both the speed and the direction of
travel.  Good luck!
