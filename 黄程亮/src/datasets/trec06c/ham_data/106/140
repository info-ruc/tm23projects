Hello!

Welcome back!  You are receiving this email because you are a registered participant in "Environmental Physiology", HPHY 470/570.  If you have received this email and are either going to drop the class or are not registered for it, please let me know ASAP as there is a substantial waiting list to get into it.

Class begins Wednesday!  We will go over the course syllabus and outline (both posted on Blackboard), and even have some time left over for starting lecture!!  The first set of lecture notes are posted on Blackboard in both .pdf and .ppt formats for your viewing pleasure.  For class this week....bring a calculator!!  We probably won't need it on Wednesday, but we might, so be prepared!  

The topic of the class is of considerable interest to both Dr. Halliwill and me, transcending our research interests to our own outdoor pursuits. We hope we can get you as excited about the topic as we are! 

See you Wednesday!!
