Dear Friends, 

I have just learned that the Russian translation of Numerical Toolbox
for Verified Computing, by R. Hammer, M. Hocks, U. Kulisch, D. Ratz
(Springer-Verlag, New York, 1993) has just appeared. 

The publisher webpage  http://shop.rcd.ru/details/436 does not have a
price yet, so probably it is not yet possible to order but they informed
Alexander (Sasha) Yakovlev that the books are ready. 

It has been a slow process with the publisher, many thanks to Sasha for
his persistence, and let us hope that there will be no further delays. 

Vladik
