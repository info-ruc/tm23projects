Dear Friends,

I have just nominated Moore's 1966 book for being re-ptinted among ACM
top classic books in computer science. The final selection will be made
by voting so if you are an ACM member please do not forget to vote. 

Vladik

P.S. Many thanks to George Corliss for attracting my attention to this
important initiative.

> Please submit your comments and candidates for CS classics by Friday,
