Hi Jonathon,

Thanks for the advice regarding the problem below.  I have since solved
the problem and the file is now working...altghough I am still not
exactly sure how I did it.  I think it had something to do with a
surplus $ character somewhere in the file.  Once I fixed this, it didn't
seem to matter that I had the backslash \ next to the + character and
the item number, as in:
 \+10201<ln -3>"have",
DMDX still recognised the backslash. Nevertheless I took your advice and
I did rewrite the file to put backslashes on separate lines....just to
be safe.

Mark

   It certainly should function, the only criteria I remember adding to
scramble for a backslash was that it had to be at the start of line.
General religious reasons make me follow it with white space however.

   Somehow or other DMDX isn't seeing the backslash as a backslash.
Either it's some extended character that just happens to look like a
backslash or the RTF is badly formed.  RTF codes all begin with a
backslash, you don't see them because Word or whatever it is that you
are using interprets them like DMDX does and displays meaningful text.
Open an item file in a text editor (Notepad if you don't have a better
one) one day and you'll see what I mean.  In fact it'd be interesting to
see just what it is that your file has in it.  What's happening is that
somehow your backslash isn't being seen as the text of the item file but
an RTF control word, hence it sees \+ which isn't an RTF control word.
Backslashes if they're really backslashes are stripped out by Scramble
so DMDX's item parser would never see them in normal operation so when
you ignore unknown RTF DMDX's item parser sees it and is looking for a
item CR indicator or an item number and it throws the syntax error.
Very weird that the RTF parser would see it as a backslash but Scramble
won't.

   Try deleting and retyping the offending section.  Or you can pour the
item file though WordPad and see if it can't strip the poorly formed
section out.
