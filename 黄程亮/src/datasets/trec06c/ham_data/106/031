Dear Sir,
Thank you for your software DMDX. I have been using this software for
many research papers. Even I am using this software for my thesis
work.

Currently I am working on Simon task and stuttering. In my experiment
I need to present two rectangles of two colors like green and yellow
in two corners of the monitor. The subjects response would be pressing
"m" key for green and "Z" key for green. I made the rectangles
MSPaint and saved as two different bmp files, and I wrote the key as
follows (just an example):

<n 1> <azk> <cr> <t 3000> <id "keyboard"> <dwc 0>

0 "press space" /;

+1 * <bmp> <x 0> <y 0> "red" / <bmp> <ln 1> <x 1> <y 0> "green" <ms% 3000>=
=20
/;

0 "THANKS" /;

but DMDX displays only the green on the left side of the monitor.
Kindly help me in solving this problem.
 who ever works on "Simon Task" can help me. Your help would be appreciated=
.

Thanking you.
