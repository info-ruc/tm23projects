   You won't be able to get rid of that lag, it's part of the codec.  Use 
another codec.  Use uncompressed AVI files if you want the fastest video 
(but of course the biggest files).

   It's an evil codec and it's crashing the machine.  If you open the video 
in the media player and move the window around you can see that the last 
image stays in the same place, it doesn't move with the media player 
window.  Use another codec.

   The length of a meeting rises with the square of the number of
people present.
