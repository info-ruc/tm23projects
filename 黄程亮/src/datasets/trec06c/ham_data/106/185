   Beyond sending me (not the list) a copy of one of the videos my guess is 
that you have used some strange encoding option that's tossing XP's support 
of the legacy Direct Show interfaces that DMDX uses out the door.  If you 
have choices in how you encode the video change some of them (preferably 
one at a time) and see if you can locate the one that's blowing things up.

been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications.
