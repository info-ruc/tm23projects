   It certainly should function, the only criteria I remember adding to 
scramble for a backslash was that it had to be at the start of 
line.  General religious reasons make me follow it with white space however.

   Somehow or other DMDX isn't seeing the backslash as a backslash.  Either 
it's some extended character that just happens to look like a backslash or 
the RTF is badly formed.  RTF codes all begin with a backslash, you don't 
see them because Word or whatever it is that you are using interprets them 
like DMDX does and displays meaningful text.  Open an item file in a text 
editor (Notepad if you don't have a better one) one day and you'll see what 
I mean.  In fact it'd be interesting to see just what it is that your file 
has in it.  What's happening is that somehow your backslash isn't being 
seen as the text of the item file but an RTF control word, hence it sees \+ 
which isn't an RTF control word.  Backslashes if they're really backslashes 
are stripped out by Scramble so DMDX's item parser would never see them in 
normal operation so when you ignore unknown RTF DMDX's item parser sees it 
and is looking for a item CR indicator or an item number and it throws the 
syntax error.  Very weird that the RTF parser would see it as a backslash 
but Scramble won't.

   Try deleting and retyping the offending section.  Or you can pour the 
item file though WordPad and see if it can't strip the poorly formed 
section out.
