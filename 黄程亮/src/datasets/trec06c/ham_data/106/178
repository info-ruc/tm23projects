Hi Everyone!

I have posted the first reading assignment on Limitations to VO2max on Blackboard under "Course Documents".  We will start discussing this topic next Wednesday.

I have had a number of people approach me about what to read as "start-up" material...particularly from those who did not take Exercise Physiology.  My recommendation is this...read over the article I posted and if you are struggling with certain topics, look them up in an exercise physiology book.  If you are still struggling on what to read or do not find this helpful, bring an Exercise Physiology or Medical Physiology text to class and I can help you find areas in which to focus.  I will make a few comments on this on Friday in class as well. See you then!
