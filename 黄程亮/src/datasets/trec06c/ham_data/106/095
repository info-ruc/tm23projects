CS382m-ers,

Kartik has made the Simplescalar tools available and if necessary will 
make any tweaks necessary so that they run smoothly for you.  Let him 
know if you have any problems.

He has also created a web page (now linked from the "handouts" page) 
which has additional simplescalar documentation.

I recommend checking it out.

Cheers,
