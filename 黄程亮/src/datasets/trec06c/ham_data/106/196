Hi Jonathan,

the suggestion you made works, tried that earlier, but it slows my experiment
down---I'd like to keep this snappy so my participants don't have time to think
really, just react.

I tried Andy Wood's suggestion of using the <ml> parameter using :

> <n 16> <azk> <cr> <fd 17> <t 2000> <id "keyboard"> <nfb> <vm 
> 1024,768,768,32,0> <dbc 200200200> <dwc 0> <os 2,0,5,5>
> 
> 
> 0 %0 <ml 1000> <dv> "other2_short.avi" / %0 <ml 1000> <dv> 
> "other2_short.avi" / %0 <ml 1000> <dv> "other2_short.avi" / "Loading 
> video";


When I try to run it, all that happens is my desktop is rearranged so that it's
75% of normal size and in the left hand corner and DMDX isn't on the task
list.

Andy suggested running a syntax check on it before running and I get an error
message from Windows saying the program has performed an illegal operation...


Any ideas as to what's going on there?



Thanks,


Carrie
