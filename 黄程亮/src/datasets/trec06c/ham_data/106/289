   No, sound frames are completely different beasts as they have no visual 
component and durations in DMDX are durations of visual components.

   No doubt it doesn't make any sense but it's all documented in the sound 
section of the help.  There were two interesting cases when I added sound 
to DMDX and unfortunately I chose the technically correct and logical one 
to be the default which is of course not what anyone wants to do so you and 
almost everyone else need <svp start> in the frame with the sound in it.

with every design, they were getting a better engineer.  It's a
