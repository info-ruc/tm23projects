I've done all of the other test for Time DX and they work.  However, if I try to run DMDX it tells me that I need to do the PIO Test.  When I go to the PIO Test, there is a drop down box which suggests to me that perhaps I should have some choices there.  In my case, the box is empty.  I want to use the keyboard as the input device so what do I need to type in this box or is it that I have to add something to my computer to get this to work?  Thanks.
