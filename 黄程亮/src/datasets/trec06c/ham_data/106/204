Dear 411/511 Students,

Because this is an online course, it is very important for you to check Blackboard on a regular basis for new announcements and reminders of upcoming quizzes, exams, and other assignments. Please also refer to the course calendar and course syllabus for clarification on these matters; but always feel free to email either or both teaching assistants at any time with any questions or concerns you have.  

Thank you.
