      <h2><font face="Gill Sans Light, Verdana, Arial, Helvetica">LibQUAL+<sup>TM</sup>
Seeks Applicants for 2006 Grant Program</font></h2>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Washington,
DC&#8212;For the first time, LibQUAL+&#8482; is sponsoring an in-kind grant program
for participants in the 2006 LibQUAL+&#8482; survey. All interested
participants are welcome to apply. LibQUAL+&#8482; will award up to five
institutions with grants to participate in the 2006 survey, with a goal
of offering one grant for every fifty registered libraries.
Registration for the 2006 LibQUAL+&#8482; survey is now open to all
interested participants on the project Web site at <a
 href="http://www.libqual.org/Register/index.cfm">http://www.libqual.org/Register/index.cfm</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">The selection of
LibQUAL+&#8482; grantees will be based on the following criteria:</font></p>
      <ol>
        <li><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif"><strong>Financial
need.</strong>
The ability of the institution to pay the $2,500 fee for participation
in LibQUAL+&#8482; will be considered. Applicants with the greatest financial
need, who also meet the other criteria, will be given priority.</font></li>
        <li><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif"><strong>Contribution
to the growth of LibQUAL+&#8482;.</strong>
The LibQUAL+&#8482; team continues to be interested in expanding the reach
and scope of the survey in terms of how the survey is applied in
different environments. Institutions whose participation would
represent a new library type, a new language translation, a new
country, or would otherwise increase the diversity of the LibQUAL+&#8482;
project are particularly encouraged to apply. </font></li>
        <li><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif"><strong>Improvements
in local service and quality.</strong>
The ability of the participant to both improve overall library services
and contribute to the quality of service provided to library users at
the institution will be considered. </font></li>
      </ol>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Interested
applicants must submit the following materials for consideration:</font></p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">A
three- to five-page narrative, explaining their unique situation and
how they meet the selection criteria (approximately 1,500 to 2,500
words)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">A brief
paragraph describing the institution and institutional background (less
than 500 words)</font></li>
        <li><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">The name, phone
number, e-mail address, and mailing address of the contact person for
the application</font></li>
        <li><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">A short
biography of the person applying on behalf of the institution</font></li>
      </ul>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">All applications
must be received no later than <strong>December 20, 2005</strong>,
in order to be considered. Application materials should be mailed to
LibQUAL+&#8482; Grant Award, Association of Research Libraries, 21 Dupont

 href="mailto:libqual@arl.org">libqual@arl.org</a>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">Applications

      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">LibQUAL+&#8482;
is a suite of services that libraries use to solicit, track,
understand, and act upon users&#8217; opinions of service quality. These
services are offered to the library community by the Association of
Research Libraries. The program&#8217;s centerpiece is a rigorously tested
Web-based survey bundled with training that helps libraries assess and
improve library services, change organizational culture, and market the
library.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Palatino, Book Antiqua, serif">The
LibQUAL+&#8482; survey instrument uses 22 core questions to measure library
users&#8217; minimum, perceived, and desired levels of service quality in
three key dimensions: Information Control, Affect of Service, and
Library as Place. As of spring 2005, more than 700 libraries have
participated in LibQUAL+&#8482;, including college and university libraries,
community college libraries, health sciences libraries, law libraries,
and public libraries&#8212;some through various consortia, others as
independent participants. The project has expanded internationally,
with participating institutions in Canada, Europe, the UK, Australia,
and South Africa, and the survey instrument is now available in six
different languages. Additional information on the LibQUAL+&#8482; project is
available online at <a href="http://www.libqual.org">http://www.libqual.org/</a>.</font></p>
