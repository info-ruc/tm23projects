Call for papers


Following the International Conference on

    Computability and Complexity in Analysis (CCA 2005)
    http://cca-net.de/cca2005

Kyoto, Japan, August 25-29, 2005,
it is planned to publish a special issue of the

    Journal of Complexity (JoC)

http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622865/desc
ription#description

This issue is supposed to contain papers related to the conference but
it is also open to other submissions that meet the standards of JoC and
the scope of CCA.


Scope

Computability and complexity theory are two central areas of research in
mathematical logic and theoretical computer science.
Computability theory is the study of the limitations and abilities of
computers in principle. Computational complexity theory provides a
framework for understanding the cost of solving computational problems,
as measured by the requirement for resources such as time and space. The
classical approach in these areas is to consider algorithms as operating
on finite strings of symbols from a finite alphabet. Such strings may
represent various discrete objects such as integers or algebraic
expressions, but cannot represent general real or complex numbers,
unless they are rounded.

Most mathematical models in physics and engineering, however, are based
on the real number concept. Thus, a computability theory and a
complexity theory over the real numbers and over more general continuous
data structures are needed. Unlike the well established classical theory
over discrete structures, the theory of computation over continuous data
is still in its infancy, despite remarkable progress in recent years.
Many important fundamental problems have not yet been studied, and
presumably numerous unexpected and surprising results are waiting to be
detected.

The topics of interest include foundational work on various models and
approaches for describing computability and complexity over the real
numbers. They also include complexity-theoretic investigations, both
foundational and with respect to concrete problems, and new
implementations of exact real arithmetic, as well as further
developments of already existing software packages. We hope to gain new
insights into computability-theoretic aspects of various computational
questions from physics and from other fields involving computations over
the real numbers.
