Hi All,

I was having some problems with video files (.avi) earlier regarding XP and long
initial latencies before the videos would play. These problems were solved by
Johnathan's suggestion of changing the codec--now using Microsoft Video 1 as
opposed to Techsmith.

We also changed the color from 16bit 256 colors.


Hope someone else finds this useful.



Carrie
