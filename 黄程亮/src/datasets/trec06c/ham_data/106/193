   My guess is that changing the codec stands a good chance of fixing your 
problem.  I get an error opening the file with TimeDX that indicates 
there's some extraneous information in there so changing the codec is more 
than likely going to strip out whatever's causing DMDX to choke.  When I 
get the time I'll have a look in the code to see what it is and make DMDX 
ignore the extraneous information incase anyone else ever makes a video 
like the ones you're making.
