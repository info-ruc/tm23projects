Hello Jonathan,
 
Thank you for your suggestion. All display errors were solved after I removed the delay parameter as you suggested. However, the mapping is still not working. I followed your suggestion and changed the input device to #. But the syntax check told me that the <#3> was not found on input devices. 
 
I once suspected that the signal sent by the mouse was not received probably because the .bmp and the .wav take up too much video memory. So I wrote another script using only text. However, the mouse still failed to function. Not even when I used # in mapping the positive and negative responses. The RTs in all items all showed the timeout ms and 100% error rate. 
 
Here are the header parameters and test items. 
<ep> <n 5> <cr> <azk> <nfb> <fd 38> <t 2500> <id "&#37749;&#30436;"> <mr +Space> <id "&#28369;&#40736;"> <umnr> <umpr> <mnr +#3> <mpr +#4> <dbc 255255255> <dwc 0> <vm 800,600,600,16,0> <eop>

-4 * "stopograttic" /;
+5 * "mouse" /;
0 "The end.  Thank you." <end>;

I am at my wits' end. Could you help me to solve the mapping problem? Thanks a lot.
 
Daphne

Your display errors will be fixed by removing the delay parameter 
altogether. Unless you have a real need for a fixed ISI don't use D.

As for the input devices if you turn on there will be a 
whole bunch of information in diagnostics.txt helping us determine what's 
gone wrong. Pretty odd that we're not getting errors about mappings that 
aren't found but I'm betting it's related to your positive response mapping 
not having a + in front of it, should be .

Typically with non-english input devices its best to use the # versions 
of them instead of their named versions, instead of "&#352;&#352;&#8216;l">. Then you can use things like -- but be careful if you use 
more than one # input device as you'll have two #0 buttons and won't be 
able to map buttons on the second device...

Because you only unmap the positive and negative response keys but not 
the requests.
