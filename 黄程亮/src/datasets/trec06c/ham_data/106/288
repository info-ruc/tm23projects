Hi list.
I have a question about the timing of outputs in a frame.

I am presenting white noise probes of 50 ms duration and sending a
corresponding trigger code to the data acquisition computer using DMDX.  The
measured latencies of the physiological responses we are getting don't
really make sense, and I am trying to figure out what's going on.

Here is a line that presents the probe and sends the output:
2         <ms% 5000> o8 <jpg> "6510" / <ms% 1000> o96 <wav 2> "wnprobe"/;

As far as I can tell, the output of "96" is sent at the onset of the wav
"wnprobe."  Is this correct?

Our data seems to imply that the output might be coming after the probe is
played, but that doesn't make sense to me.

Thanks for your help.

Ian
