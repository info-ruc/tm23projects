Thanks Jonathan that really helped. I just have one more question
(hopefully).

Is there a way I can see what response the participant gave to each item on
the output file? It is too difficult for me to make a note on whether they
gave a correct response while they are doing the experiment, so it would be
nice if I could see what response they made later.

There are 8 possible responses to each item: 'a' 's' 'd' 'f' 'h' 'j' 'k' and
'l'. I presume it is something to do with zil - but when I tried it all I
got was the item number and their reaction time.

Thanks

Ben
