Hello everyone,
AJ here!  I said I would send you all copies of what we went over in lab on Tuesday, but have since learned that it will be available tomorrow on blackboard.  I believe next week's lab will also be available.  It will be your responsibility to print those off for class.  Weekly assignments will be posted on blackboard, too.  Don't forget about your picture cards for Tuesday!
Obviously, this is my email address.  Use it to communicate with me outside of the class.  You may also set up appointments with me using email.  I will be as flexible as possible about schedule for meeting with you if need be!
I look forward to our future labs,
AJ
