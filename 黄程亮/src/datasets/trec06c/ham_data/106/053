   That's the decimal representation of the raw ascii 
characters.  Amazingly the # character is somehow -85 -10 -74 115 32 
instead of the 35 it should be.  Some kind of weird escape code has gotten 
in there.  Pretty impressive as it's my code that puts it in there but who 
knows what chicanery is going on to handle your Asian fonts.  Unless you 
can successfully copy the text out of diagnostics.txt for the name of that 
key you'll have to give up on the whole # based scheme and use normal input 
device and button names and paste the button names out of diagnostics.txt 
after changing the item file to use the non # version of the device name.

   Weird.  I'll have a look at the code and see if I can see what's getting 
a hold of the button names and mucking them up in which case there'll be a 
new version of DMDX to try this afternoon.
