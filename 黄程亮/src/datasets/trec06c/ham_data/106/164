Subject: [DMDX] Bug after upgrading to 3.1.4.1?

Hi All,

I'm trying to troubleshoot a problem script and don't seem to be able  
to find an up to date changelog on the website.  I was wondering if  
someone could tell me a list of changes between versions 3.1.2.6 and  
3.1.4.1

The problem is we have some scripts that worked just fine under  
3.1.2.6 and after we upgraded to 3.1.4.1 they started producing large  
timing errors.

We use disk imaging in our labs so before we upgrade DMDX we roll the  
entire disk image back to the way it was when we first setup our  
labs.  This way I can ensure that the only difference from the  
working setup to the broken one was that we upgraded DMDX.  We've  
also tried running the same script on different computers with  
identical hardware as well as an identical disk image to rule out  
faulty hardware.
Details of our lab setup can be found at http://www.maccs.mq.edu.au/ 
resources/Computing/DMDX/

Examples of the scripts and their .zil/.azk file with the errors in  
it are here.
http://www.maccs.mq.edu.au/~crichard/dmdx/Adjectives/
In this .zil file subject 25 was run with our base image with DMDX  
3.1.2.6 and subject 27 was run after we installed 3.1.4.1

http://www.maccs.mq.edu.au/~crichard/dmdx/IAT/
In the .azk file in this directory subject 18 was run with 3.1.2.6,  
subject 19 was run with 3.1.4.1 (in diagnostic mode) and subject 20  
was run with 3.1.4.1.

After these tests I then updated the display drivers to be the  
current ATI catalyst version and re-ran the tests.
3.1.4.1 behaved the same way however.

If anyone has any suggestions or knows of any changes between  
versions that might have caused this they'd be very much appreciated.

thanks,
Craig
