   Well you've specified that the two rectangles are to be drawn nearly on 
top of each other so you'll only be seeing the second one of them.  And <ln 
1> doesn't mean anything with bitmaps.

   Typically when I'm displaying bitmaps in the fashion you're describing I 
set <xyjustification> to 1 so coordinates represent the middle of images 
and I use the fractional coordinate system like this:

<n 1> <azk> <cr> <t 3000> <id "keyboard"> <dwc 0> <xyjustification 1>
0 "press space" /;
+1 * <bmp> <x 0.25> <y 0.5> "red" / <bmp> <x 0.75> <y 0.5> "green" <ms% 3000>
/;
0 "THANKS" /;


   Be aware that if you try and put an image too far off the screen 
(sometimes any amount off the screen) it won't be displayed.  You're also 
using the default video mode which is generally a bad idea these days 
unless you're using really old hardware.
