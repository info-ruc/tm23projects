Hi Jonathon,

Thanks for your advice.  Unfortunately doing as you suggest did not
help.  Therefore I am still stuck.  Besides, the syntax I originally
used with the backslash definitely works without problem in my other
file.  That is, the following causes no problem in my other file:

0"READY - PRESS SPACEBAR";$
\+10201<ln -3>"have",
<ln -2>"house",
<ln -1>"their",
<ln -0>"could",
<ln 1>"whole",
<ln 2>"they",
<ln 3>*!"painted"<c>;

Have you got any other advice about what things may be causing a
'missing item number' or things like 'RTF control word <\+> used not
supported' errors?  I would appreciate any tips or clues.

Mark

   It's your backslash.  I'm impressed at the way it's breaking the
parser 
but for DMDX syntax it is a little malformed.  You need to have a new
line 
after your backslash:

>0"READY - PRESS SPACEBAR";$
>
>\+11901<ln -3>"have",
>
><ln -2>"bike",

It needs to be like this:

>0"READY - PRESS SPACEBAR";$
>
>\
>
>+11901<ln -3>"have",
>
><ln -2>"bike",

  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
