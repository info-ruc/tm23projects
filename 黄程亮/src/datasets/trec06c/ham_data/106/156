Hello,

You can find a "Filtered Hosts" list as well as a "Unpatched Hosts"
lists further down in this message. If you manage a host that is in
the list of unpatched hosts, then I highly recommend that you:

1. Patch the host ASAP, or firewall it until it if it cannot be
patched for some reason.

2. Check the system for rogue services (e.g. back doors, FTP servers,
etc.).  www.foundstone.com has a nice tool called Vision for
identifying  ports and processes on Windows hosts.

If your host is in the "Filtered Hosts" list, then ..

1. Make sure that the host has been completely cleaned up. Unless the
host is completely rebuilt, please make sure that the host is not
running any rogue IRC bots, FTP servers, VNC, etc. Tools like "tcpview"
and "procexp" from www.sysinternals.com should help to locate any such
services.

2. Send an email message to security@ucsb.edu to inform us that the host
is now safe to be connected with the internet. When referring to
multiple IP addresses, please list the IP addresses on separate lines.
If you are not the NOC's official network contact for the address(es),
then be sure to CC that person. If you decide to simply reply to this
message, please do *not* include the complete lists of IPs. Please just
include the IP(s) that you are writing to us about.

3. If you find any rogue services running, please include the type of
service and the port that it was using.

Patch these hosts soon or they are likely to be compromised and on
the filtered list:
