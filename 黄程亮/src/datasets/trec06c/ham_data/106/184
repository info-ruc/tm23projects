Hi,

I figured out my video problem--it's a Windows XP (service pack 1 and 2) thing.
I managed to get everything running in the end on a Dell laptop with Windows
2000.

We knew it wasn't a codec problem because the videos were made on the same
machines that I was trying to use before and would play in Media Player without
problem.

Is there anyway to fix the XP problem---my department has upgraded all of our
computers with XP and I might struggle to keep a machine with 98 or 2000 on
it.




Thanks,


Carrie
