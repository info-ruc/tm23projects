   Your display errors will be fixed by removing the delay parameter 
altogether.  Unless you have a real need for a fixed ISI don't use D.

   As for the input devices if you turn on <testmode 10> there will be a 
whole bunch of information in diagnostics.txt helping us determine what's 
gone wrong.  Pretty odd that we're not getting errors about mappings that 
aren't found but I'm betting it's related to your positive response mapping 
not having a + in front of it, <mpr ˆÂçä+1> should be <mpr +ˆÂçä+1>.

   Typically with non-english input devices its best to use the # versions 
of them instead of their named versions, <id "#ŠŠ‘l"> instead of <id 
"ŠŠ‘l">.  Then you can use things like <mr #0> -- but be careful if you use 
more than one # input device as you'll have two #0 buttons and won't be 
able to map buttons on the second device...

   Because you only unmap the positive and negative response keys but not 
the requests.
