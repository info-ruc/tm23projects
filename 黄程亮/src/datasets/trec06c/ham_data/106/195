   Yeah, well after looking at the code the answer is definitely use 
another encoding.  The video renderer is telling me that the extraneous 
information is the video buffer I get my data from and it isn't needed -- 
which is insane.  My guess is that the codec you've used wants to stick the 
data on the screen itself and that ain't happening in DMDX.  Use another 
codec if you want to use XP.
