Hi Valerie, 
I will be in the office on Friday, 9-1, and would be happy to go over these questions with you then. I am cc'ing this message to Dr. Schombert for a response regarding the HPHY 362. 

If my office hours do not work for you, there are two other new advisors that you could talk with this week who will be in the office any day between 10 and 2. 

Let me know what time works for you. 

Heather
