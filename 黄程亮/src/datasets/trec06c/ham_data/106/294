Ian,
I am assuming that you are measuring startle. The svp start that Jonathan
indicated will synch up the request to play the sound with the output.
However, you should also know that in our testing, sound cards varied quite
dramatically in how long the delay was between that request and the actual
start of the sound (in your case the noise probe). Perhaps more troubling,
for some cards, that delay was not only long, but quite variable trial to
trial ( e.g., range from 4 - 20 ms for one card), which would really screw
up your ability to measure startle latency if you care about it (and your
ability to average startle waveforms if you reduce startle that way). You
can test this most easily for you card by sending the output of your sound
card to an analog channel on your physio amplifiers and verifying its onset
relative to the trigger code you are outputting. Hope that helps.
