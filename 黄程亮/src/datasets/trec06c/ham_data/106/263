Hey,

Quick question. Is there a way of getting multiple clockons for one item? I
am writing a program that requires the participant to press multiple keys
for each item. At the moment I use the variablegrouping command, and then
multiple items each starting with a clockon symbol. However, there is a
delay between each item, which means I don't get the response times that I
would normally achieve if they were free to press the keys when they liked.

Is there any way I can get around this. Below is part of the code I have
been writing. The bmp pictures need to stay because the program is for
children, so they need to have something nice to look at (in this case it is
a duck called 'Isaac').
