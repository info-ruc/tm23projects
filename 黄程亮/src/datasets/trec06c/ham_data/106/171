Hi,

I'm back with my question again. When I run a script with a .avi movie DMDX
freezes (nothing happens and I have to CTRL_ALT_DEL to end task).

I'm trying to get it to run on a Dell laptop with Windows XP and DMDX 3.1.4.1. I
didn't have this trouble getting it to run on my own PC (Win 98) DMDX 3.0.2.5
and another PC (Win XP) DMDX 3.0.4.8. Would it be possible to get this
(3.0.4.8) version of DMDX?

Is there some sort of difference between laptops and PCs that could account for
this?




Thanks,

Carrie
