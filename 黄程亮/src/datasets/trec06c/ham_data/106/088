Friends,

Thanks to the outpouring of support from throughout New England (see below)
and across the US and beyond, the Mayor of Cambridge has announced a public
hearing on Tuesday, October 18 on the proposed destruction of the dance
floor at the Cambridge VFW.  The springboard dance floor is an endangered
species, one of the last five or six left in the country.  It is critical
that supporters continue to send in letters and petitions.  Please print out
the attached letter, sign it, put on a stamp, and drop it in a mail box.  We
need every single letter we can get, now more than ever.  Every letter has
to be logged in, the sender=B9s name, address and subject recorded, and then
it must be filed and this is what gets their attention.

For info, keep checking

Saw them...wonderful, aren't they?  I know it takes extra effort to
include that sort of thing, but I for one really appreciate it.

I don't know if anyone's mentioned them before, but I recently got the
second 'Altenglische Country Dances' CD and really enjoy the
instrumentation on both.  Performed by Ferdinand Grueneis & Playford's
Delight/Consort.  Pricy at $22 a pop and sparse on the documentation,
but a must for those who enjoy ECD on period instruments -- Please!
Can we ban the accordion for a decade or two?!?

I personally know of a few so I would have guessed the number of them that
still exist is much higher than 5 or 6.
The problem as I understand it is that the old way of building them will
not satisfy current code so there are no new ones except for construction
that simulates the spring floor by other means.
I seem to recall that there was a thread on this list about this topic a
year or two ago.

This is a little out of our time period, but I bet you
all can help.
I'm helping the New Jersey Historical Society with an
exhibit which includes information about a local 19th
century dancing master.  They would like a simple (!?)
description of Lancers' Quadrille. I have the
description from their book, but a modern-language set
of figures would be helpful. It's difficult to get
non-dancers (of our sort) to understand that there's
no way I can describe "one person's steps for the
dance" in a meaningful way. Yes, I get to do a program
too, and for that I'll use a Virginia Reel, which was
also one of the dances this dancing master had in his
repertoire, and is simple enough to teach non-dancers
of varying ages. But for the exhibit the museum folk
want Lancers, because that's what the music they have
is supposed to be for. So the Lancers description
needs to be done in words and pictures to be read and
looked at by folks who are wandering around the
exhibit.
Thanks. Melanie

Excellent descriptions of three of the figures are here:

http://www.vintagedancers.org/ball_in_box.html

and if you write to author Patri Pugliese (patri-AT-vintagedancers.org), I
guarantee you he has similar writeups for the other two.

I imagine some combination of Patri's text and the period
text and illustrations found here will do it for you:

Colin, if profit isn't your motive, then definitely go with the
website.  Less cost for you, less cost for us.

I'd suggest putting some sort of Paypal 'tip jar' on your website,
though, to encourage a bit of monetary appreciation.

I wonder if we could get any musicians to do something similar?
Distributing MP3s would be fast, easy and just about free...their costs
would be about the same.  I certainly don't mind buying CDs, but I'd be
just as happy paying less if the musicians' costs were reduced as well.
 Recording, pressing, printing, packaging, distributing and retailing
CDs ain't cheap.  Web delivery's the future.

The 'Heffers' and Father Porter did a grand job, to my mind. Their
upside down 2nd B music for Shrewsbury Lasses has always seemed to me
a stroke of genius. Likewise with the Bishop, where they added
setting (well why not? It is otherwise an 8-step cast), suggested
what is in effect an assisted lead up and cast (again, why not? It
seems to be fashionable nowadays to do the same in Mr Isaac's
Maggot!), and then half a ring; for the second B music they repeated
the first one using the other couple. The Gypsy is only a filler for
an idle couple, and very often idle couples devise their own fillers
anyway. There would appear to be a problem with B1 as it stands in
the original, as all that is offered for an 8-bar phrase is a lead up
and cast off - rather treading water?

I think you might be looking a long time for the Bishop in Playford!
Yes, it is in 'Playford Ball', where it is clearly attributed to
Thompson's Compleat Collection, vol. 4 - 1780  :-)

Dear Tom:



I asked the same question of David Flemming Williams when I got my Pemberley

CD Volume 2.



The dance is "Never Love Me More" played with the correct number of bars.



The version of the dance in Pemberley Volume 1 was incorrectly timed.



Hope that helps.



Regards, John

Does anyone know what song 19 on this Pemberly Players CD is? It runs 7:30
and sounds familiar. The back of the CD only listed 17. Track 18 is a minute
or so of silence, so I figure that's related to the data files on the CD.



(PS - Funny that my spell checker suggests 'Puberty' as a replacement for
Pemberly!)

Well, I think the Heffner-Porter version of The Bishop is great, however, as we have the dance today it is hardly at all related to the original 2 dances, either The Bishop or the original Miss Doland's Delight. My question was not to disparage what Heffner-Porter created; in fact, it is very interesting in an historical sense that what they created is presented as a "reconstruction" was really nothing of the sort--it was a very modern pastiche. Thus I ask, first 1)did they do this same process to other "Apted Dances," such as, for example, Fandango; and, 2) WHY did they think that they could take elements of 2 dances & combine them with yet others, not included in the historical record, to create a third--admittedly a HIT dance in the 20th century? Would we allow anyone to do this today?--I think not. Finally, I am intrigued by your use of the term "Father Heffner" in relation to Arthur. Why? What's the story here? What I want to say is that I don't disagree with their chor!
 eography--far from it!--but I want to know why they represented The Bishop as a period piece, when it wasn't.

<html><P>Well, I think the Heffner-Porter version of The Bishop is great, however, as we have&nbsp;the dance today it is hardly at all related to the original 2 dances, either The Bishop or the original Miss Doland's Delight. My question was not to disparage what Heffner-Porter created; in fact, it is very interesting in an historical sense that what they created is presented as a "reconstruction" was really&nbsp;nothing of the sort--it was a very&nbsp;modern pastiche. Thus I&nbsp;ask, first 1)did they do this same process to other "Apted Dances," such as, for example, Fandango; and, 2) WHY did they think that they could take elements of 2 dances &amp; combine them with yet others, not included in the historical record, to create a third--admittedly a HIT dance in the 20th century? Would we allow anyone to do this today?--I think not. Finally, I am intrigued by your use of the term "Father Heffner" in relation to Arthur. Why? What's the story here? What I want to say is that!
  I don't disagree with their choreography--far from it!--but I want to know why they represented&nbsp;The Bishop&nbsp;as a period piece, when it wasn't.</P>

<DIV>The 'Heffers' and Father Porter did a grand job, to my mind. Their upside down 2nd B music for Shrewsbury Lasses has always seemed to me a stroke of genius. Likewise with the Bishop, where they added setting (well why not? It is otherwise an 8-step cast), suggested what is in effect an assisted lead up and cast (again, why not? It seems to be fashionable nowadays to do the same in Mr Isaac's Maggot!), and then half a ring; for the second B music they repeated the first one using the other couple. The Gypsy is only a filler for an idle couple, and very often idle couples devise their own fillers anyway. There would appear to be a problem with B1 as it stands in the original, as all that is offered for an 8-bar phrase is a lead up and cast off - rather treading water?</DIV>

On Demand publishing is definitely the wave of the future -- for music as well as some books.  Certainly reference is going this way.  New editions of Grove and the OED will available only on line in the future.  It's much more economical.  Corrections/additions can be made instantly.  And for the "publisher" it saves laying out a lot up front and getting it back in dribs and drabs over time.  Though there's a lot to be said for holding a beautifully produced book.  But for the self-publisher, absolutely the way to go.

Having something available on the web doesn't necessarily mean "for free".  I assumed Colin would charge for his publication just as he would if he had printed it up in advance.  And it should be copyrighted in the usual way.  There is absolutely no reason for anyone to give their creative work away -- unless they want to -- whether it's choreography or music.  And should respect the value of the creative effort by paying for it.

It has been noted on this list that we often bandy directions around without regard for the copyright of the authors.  Not everyone but sometimes, we forget.  Personally I don't think we should give any dance instructions away unless they're in the public domain -- or possibly in an out of print source.  Or we have the express permission from the choreographer.

Our choreographers and musicians don't make much out of their work, as Colin noted.  Just because it may not be their principal source of income is no reason to assume the person who created it wouldn't appreciate (and expect) some monetary return.

It's not freeware.
Suzanne

Colin, if profit isn't your motive, then definitely go with the
website.  Less cost for you, less cost for us.

I'd suggest putting some sort of Paypal 'tip jar' on your website,
though, to encourage a bit of monetary appreciation.

I wonder if we could get any musicians to do something similar?
Distributing MP3s would be fast, easy and just about free...their costs
would be about the same.  I certainly don't mind buying CDs, but I'd be
just as happy paying less if the musicians' costs were reduced as well.
 Recording, pressing, printing, packaging, distributing and retailing
CDs ain't cheap.  Web delivery's the future.

Books and music are still being published.  It's just that big things -- multi-volume sets -- are becoming prohibitively expensive to produce.  I don't know how you get around this.  But for the smaller publisher -- the self publisher -- it actually results in more things being available.  So there is a bright side, imho.

If you don't care about receiving any monetary compensation for the
dances, and what you want to do is make them available to callers and
musicians, certainly the web makes the most sense. Clearly that is what
you have now done with DWAD-3, so perhaps that is what you are
thinking. Lots of contra dance composers publish their dances on
websites, free for anyone to copy and use, in hopes of getting their
dances out, with no thought of being paid for them. If you still wish
to receive some money for the dances, and can set up a pay-per-download
system, I would find that preferable to book form, as I would be able
to buy just the dances I need when I need them, rather than a whole
book.

No. On the other hand, music is a little different. I give away printed
copies of my music all the time, in the explicit hope that one of these days
someone will record one of the tunes, at which point I get royalties as

of the recordings never got released.

Not so dramatically, but yes, they changed it.  The facsimile is in
"The Playford Ball", and you can see that they added the turn single
after the ones cast.  As Nic Broadbridge said of "The Bishop", this
was to avoid a eight-beat cast - don't forget they were doing it to a
running step in those days.  More importantly, they changed the
direction of the figure eights.  I imagine the original sequence was:
"Right-hand turn first corner, left-hand turn partner, right-hand turn
second corner, left-hand turn partner" (as you find in "Bonny
Breast-knot (Devon)", hundreds of Scottish dances and (in reverse) the
"turn contra corners" of contra-dancing.  That automatically leaves
the ones facing in the correct direction: man down, lady up for the
figure eights.  Having decided to use two-hand turns, the
reconstructors had to switch direction for the figure eights, and also
accept the fact that in effect the ones turn their second corner only
half-way and then their partner one and a half.

By the way, I agree with Nic that adding the upside-down B2 to convert
"Shrewsbury Lasses" to a three-couple dance was a stroke of genius.

> Would we allow anyone to do this today?--I think not.

You're over-optimistic!  Most dancers and callers don't look at the
original, so they wouldn't know (or care) whether it had been
substantially modified.  Tom Cook's reconstructions are so different
from the originals in many cases that I would call them new dances.
Ken Sheffield takes enormous liberties with his material.  Charles
Bolton's view is that the first couple's path is sacrosanct, but it is
perfectly permissible to add extra moves for the twos and threes to
make the dance more interesting for them.  I'm more cautious than
this, but I still make changes which I consider necessary.

It's difficult to know what is best.  I remember Anne Daye (Chairman
of the Dolmetsch Historical Dance Society) being amazed at Charles's
approach when we were at a workshop he was running.  Historical
reconstructors would try to be absolutely accurate - and then decide
that the dance wasn't worth doing!

Why not is one way to look at it, but also the setting is in turn
suggested by the melody of Miss Dolland's delight which shifts to the beat
from the syncopated motif of the first four steps in the cast. If I were
writing a dance to Miss Dolland's, a distinctive beat-oriented step is
just what I would look for to meet the tune there and setting certainly
fits the bill. I wonder if the decision to use the alternate tune led to
any of the choreographic modifications/interpretations or if it post-dated
the revisions?

I think YES.
Whether the reconstructions/modifications are close to the original or
different enough to be considered new dances, they are boldly presented to
today's dancers (at least at my dances). Many of my own reconstructions
are to return the dance to something closer to the original, but others
are nearly unrecognizable because the original is uninterpretable, has
mistakes in the notations, or simply because I felt I could better portray
the tune with my own creativity than the original instructions.

Only rarely do I run into situations where the dancers are so entrenched
in doing a particular variant and NO OTHER that I feel I cannot suggest
alternative interpretations. It's like when I call a Playford dance for a
crowd that "demands" a waltz at the break or the end. I don't like the
pressure but I try to acquiesce because it is, after all, "their dance."

Thanks Beth, and Mickie, for the better analogy... the single reed in the
hornpipe is indeed a "free reed" like that in a bagpipe drone, unlike the
clarinet reed which is controlled with the player's embouchure.

Some medieval and Renaissance hornpipes had the reed fully enclosed by the
animal horn, making it a "capped single-reed" instrument.in contrast to that
beloved (by early musckers at least) buzzy, the krumhorn, which has a capped
double reed (like a bassoon).

Accordions, harmonicas, and concertinas are all "free reed" instruments as
well, so it's only fitting that they be among the modern vehicles for
hornpipe music.

Using Tom's post as my cue to inquire once again...

Bare Necessities is ("are" for our friends across the pond) about to record
volumes 9 and 10 of their ECD series, and we will release them on jewel-case
CDs later this year (if all goes well, in time for Christmas).

But I'd like to take a straw poll:  how many of you would be interested in
seeing these and the previous albums on iTunes or a similar download
service?  Assume usual fee of 99 cents per track (dance).

For ease of tabulation and to save list bandwidth, just send a message with
"BN download yes" as the subject line to  gmurrow-AT-post.harvard.edu  No
obligation, just curious to see the breadth of interest in this delivery
medium.

Thanks,

In regard to the topic of boldly reconstructing where no one has gone before, let me clarify.
It seems to me that most people who reconstruct dances these days include in their published version the original--often in facsimile. So today's callers--I agree that most dancers don't care about any of this & just want a good dance--can, if they wish, see where the reconstructor hewed to the line or went far afield. I didn't mean to prevent to reconstructor from a liberal and creative interpretation--it's just that today, we have more disclosure.
But the Apted gang--and Sharp too, for that matter--withheld this information and presented their versions as "fact," and it is this aspect of the matter that I'm interested in. Who knew, until Keller & Shimer came along, that the good old Bishop was not only a blend of 2 dances, but contained wholly new elements not seen in either of its progenitors?  And look at all those tunes that Sharp discarded as too debased and then substituted often completely unrelated "superior" tunes--usually modal.The end result of what these folks did was great--but it was a different era then in terms of how experts interacted with the hoi polloi.

I think that rather depends on what the goal is, doesn't it?  If the
goal is to create the closest possible reconstruction of the original
dance, then I'd expect a pretty strict approach that does not involve
adding extra moves or changing figures unless the dance is simply not
danceable without such changes.  And even then I'd be wary, since it
might be my understanding of the source that's lacking rather than the
instructions.  I tend to put dances I think are undanceable aside for
a year or two and then come back to them, hoping that further
experience will help me make sense of the instructions.

If the goal is to create enjoyable social dances for modern audiences,
then I don't see why there's a particular problem with making changes
or adaptations, provided one is straightforward about what one's
doing.  Reasonable people can disagree on whether the results are
good, since that's a matter of personal taste.  Something can be a
terrible reconstruction and still be a fine dance or, conversely, be a
very good reconstruction but a dreadful dance.

I think the problem (for me, at least) comes in when one is not
up-front about these things and either claims or lets people assume
that it's a direct reconstruction when instead it's an adaptation.
That tends to make me think that person is either poorly-informed or
dishonest.  How hard is it to say "this is a dance from 1785 that I
tweaked a little to make it more fun" if that's what has in fact
happened?  If anyone wants the details, they can ask.  Most people
probably won't since, as you said, they don't care.

Or perhaps wasn't worth doing without adding fancy steps back in.  I
find that putting in complex steps more than makes up for having
very simple figures, at least until one has so much experience that
the steps are second nature.

(I know I'm kind of a socialist and not much of a capitalist in this area
but here is my take. Bear in mind that my own opinion does not imply
judgemental condemnation of those with opposing viewpoints).
My own opinion about this is that if I wanted to make money (even just
pennies) I would not chose to be composing dances and tunes to augment a
traditional community-oriented public art such as ECD or contra. If you
wish to make money at it, keep your stuff out of public view. If you
simply want people to derive enjoyment and fulfillment from something you
feel you have to add to the wonderful body of dances and music already
being enjoyed, then be willing to give from the heart. Accept donations
that facilitate your ability to give even more but don't restrict the
enjoyment by demanding admission at the door, royalties for authorship,
and license to learn from what each of us has to give.
I do not oppose documenting one's authorship nor making attributions and
citing others when the authors are known. I feel this adds color to the
event and keeps all of us thinking about how much the community at large
relies on the contributions of many. I do not oppose the making or sale of
CDs and books for whatever reason (e.g., personal gain, mitigating
expenses, facilitating the next issue). I view them as one way to actually
increase the likelihood that a greater audience may come in contact with
and further spread what we have to offer. It is the effort to restrict the
public sharing after public airing that I can't agree with and feels
unethical to me (no matter what the law says).
This came home to me one time when I was threatened with a suit for
teaching someone else a variation on a contra tune that I heard someone
playing at a dance one time. They felt they owned that variation and that
picking up a nuance by ear from the dance floor was a violation of
copyright. I wondered if I should copyright the innovations I was doing on
the dance floor to prevent others (especially that fiddler) from picking
up on those? Perhaps the musicians should pay the dancers for the
privilege of catching a glimpse into their creative talents? (Ironically
my own disdain for tying money-making to indigenous folk art meant I
wasn't worth the cost of a suit and the threat remained only that).

The fact that someone would try to restrict the enjoyment of thousands of
dancers in order to make a buck completely cured me of any such desire in
my own work. When I first started writing tunes I wondered if I should try
to copyright them. Then one day while dancing at the VFW in Cambridge, I
heard a band from California play a waltz I had written and felt so proud
that I had contributed something to the body of music the bands were
using. Better yet - they had no idea who the composer was so I knew it was
selected purely on its own merits! That beats all potential royalties in
my book!!! It gave me the self confidence and enthusiasm to compose many
other tunes that have enriched the field since and I am ever grateful for
the circuitous grapevine of unrestricted aural transmission that brings
melodies and dances back to me for my own dancing pleasure.

Speaking to Cammy's monologue on dance and tune selling and creating
- really the problem is that the things one does with most success
are those which one has one heart in.  Choosing a profession is not
always an intellectual process - when one is called or lead to the
choice, there's still the problem of heating the apartment and
filling the stomach and paying for the printing.

And doing something one has no heart for just for the money is not
always a positive thing.  Hating one's work can mar one's creativity.
Being bored to tears at one's work can also.  Having demanding work
can be so exhausting that the real love goes into retreat for lack of
the energy to do both.  Dividing onesself between two loves - the one
that pays and the one that doesn't - can make it really hard for
being related to other people.

And giving away one's lovework can make it really difficult for those
who have chosen to try to make a living doing it.

As long as our culture is predicated upon exchanging goods and
services for money I believe it's going to be necessary for those who
consume to recognize that they need to buy and not just take.

I think it would be great!  I don't know how many tracks are on each
CD, but downloading 10 MP3 tracks for $10 would certainly be cheaper
than the $15-20 CD price, though I would hope that the liner notes
would be available for download as well.  That would mean two different
vehicles, since iTunes probably doesn't handle text/PDFs.

I don't know if not burdening a crowd that doesn't need to or want to
know, with detailed footnotes is the same as presenting a version as
"fact."

Example 1:
I taught Black Nag to a bunch of 10 year olds a birthday party. When I
announced we were going to do a hey, before I could explain they chimed in
that they thought they should lie stiff on the ground like scattered
sticks of straw for that phrase of the music and then leap to their feet
for the turn single. I let them do it that way and it was grand fun. I may
have said that there were other ways to do the hey but I assured them that
this was certainly one of the best I had ever seen.

Example 2:
I stole the first figure from Trip to Paris to rewrite the third figure of
Blew Britches since the existing instructions do not fit the melody well
at all. By so doing, it became a dance I could offer as part of a fun
evening of dances. I rarely talk about how much I changed the ending
because it is not of interest to the crowd. When people come up to me
after and say "I loved that dance you did after the break. What was the
name and where can I find the instructions?" I usually explain that I took
significant liberties with the original in my reconstruction. I have
copies of my reconstruction to hand them and on the backside of all my
dance reconstructions is a copy of the Playford facsimile so people who
wish can delve into what the changes are.

Example 2:
During the commemoration activities of the 300th anniversary of the French
and Indian massacre of the town of Old Deerfield I was presiding as
dancing master in the ballroom above the tavern while tourists, children,
re-enactors of French officers, American natives, and Deerfield settlers
(most with zero experience) wandered in and out of the dances (often
between pints downstairs). The harpsichordist and I decided to do
Nonesuch. After teaching the intro and the first progressive figure, we
played it for them to do to the music and continued until all had been
active and mastered the choreography. Then I told them to thank their
partners and find new ones for another dance. I didn't say, they didn't
ask, and it was my judgement that they didn't need to be informed that
this was a mere fraction of the whole dance published in 1651. Perhaps
that was presenting a serious revision as "fact" but I really felt that
everyone had a more satisfying time not knowing anything more than that
they had successfully gotten through a dance to the music of a melody
popular in the 17th century.

I have not published material like this and I'm sure if I did it would
contain the qualifications, citations, and disclaimers it ought to have.
However, it could be that someone there may have jotted down the figures
and tune to use at their "English Tea" the next week and a whole group of
people may think it is authentic 17th century dancing. I didn't say it
was, but they may assume it is. Likewise with the other examples.

My point is that we do in fact take similar liberties today even though
this is a different era and more of the scholars are familiar with
reproductions of the original publications.

I sent a kneejerk "yes" response to Gene, but there's something about
having the CD and case and liner notes in your hands, with Volumes
1-10 all lined up together, so Gene, if you're reading this, I
withdraw my "yes".

Besides, no matter how many times I tell them, the iTunes Music Store
refuses to correct the spelling errors on the two BN CD's they sell,
although they faithfully duplicated the typographical error for the
tune "Bare Necesstities" from the "ECDs" CD. On "Take a Dance" they
have "Knives and Fork" and "Fendango".

I chose NOT to make a living at it since doing so would change the very
aspects I loved - accessibility to all and public ownership that defines
folk art and community activities. Once one tries to make a living at
this, it becomes a performer/audience activity rather than a community
event and I felt that was incompatible with where I wished to see social
dance go in the years ahead. I felt it was selfish for me to restrict
access by those unable to pay, in order to get basic living necessities
for myself.

The incident where I was threatened with legal action was a variation I
learned at the Concord Scouthouse which I had hitch-hiked 100 miles to get
to because I couldn't afford to keep a car on the road and get food to eat
in the tent where I lived because I couldn't afford an apartment. My point
is that "heating the apartment and filling the stomach and paying for the
printing" (for those who have the luxury of even those concerns) does not
necessitate making this into an entrepreneurial activity. That is a choice
that each individual makes.

For me, if I chose to make a living at music I would get a band, rehearse,
perform, record, sell sell sell etc... but I wouldn't hit up the local
community dance (that lets families of 6, dance for the price of 2) for my
set fee in order to pay my water bill. It's not fair to the community. If
I wanted to get paid like a performer, I would do performances and try not
to burden the community events with my personal financial needs.

Nor do I feel that whether this is "lovework" or a mild hobby changes my
view on this.

Cammy

P.S. By the way, I agree with you that owning and holding a nice bound
book is a wonderful feeling that I cannot enjoy from downloaded printouts.
It would be a tragedy if books and records were to fall victim to internet
sharing alternatives.

Just to clarify my point...

What an individual chooses to do with his or her creative product is entirely up to them.  Give it away on request, sell it, post it to a tree, make it downloadable from a website.  That is a personal choice.

I was responding to the (possible) assumption that choreography or music is available to share without consulting the creator.  Or that just because we're part of the folk dance community, compensation for creative effort is somehow not necessary -- because we're all in it for love.  Which we are.  But still, paying for something can be an acknowledgement of value -- or at least compensation for time and effort.

CDs and books for whatever reason (e.g., personal gain, mitigating
expenses, facilitating the next issue). I view them as one way to actually
increase the likelihood that a greater audience may come in contact with
and further spread what we have to offer. It is the effort to restrict the
public sharing after public airing that I can't agree with and feels
unethical to me (no matter what the law says).
This came home to me one time when I was threatened with a suit for
teaching someone else a variation on a contra tune that I heard someone
playing at a dance one time. They felt they owned that variation and that
picking up a nuance by ear from the dance floor was a violation of
copyright. I wondered if I should copyright the innovations I was doing on
the dance floor to prevent others (especially that fiddler) from picking
up on those? Perhaps the musicians should pay the dancers for the
privilege of catching a glimpse into their creative talents? (Ironically
my own disdain for tying money-making to indigenous folk art meant I
wasn't worth the cost of a suit and the threat remained only that).

The fact that someone would try to restrict the enjoyment of thousands of
dancers in order to make a buck completely cured me of any such desire in
my own work. When I first started writing tunes I wondered if I should try
to copyright them. Then one day while dancing at the VFW in Cambridge, I
heard a band from California play a waltz I had written and felt so proud
that I had contributed something to the body of music the bands were
using. Better yet - they had no idea who the composer was so I knew it was
selected purely on its own merits! That beats all potential royalties in
my book!!! It gave me the self confidence and enthusiasm to compose many
other tunes that have enriched the field since and I am ever grateful for
the circuitous grapevine of unrestricted aural transmission that brings
melodies and dances back to me for my own dancing pleasure.

but here is my take. Bear in mind that my own opinion does not imply
judgemental condemnation of those with opposing viewpoints).
My own opinion about this is that if I wanted to make money (even just
pennies) I would not chose to be composing dances and tunes to augment a
traditional community-oriented public art such as ECD or contra. If you
wish to make money at it, keep your stuff out of public view. If you
simply want people to derive enjoyment and fulfillment from something you
feel you have to add to the wonderful body of dances and music already
being enjoyed, then be willing to give from the heart. Accept donations
that facilitate your ability to give even more but don't restrict the
enjoyment by demanding admission at the door, royalties for authorship,
and license to learn from what each of us has to give.
I do not oppose documenting one's authorship nor making attributions and
citing others when the authors are known. I feel this adds color to the
event and keeps all of us thinking about how much the community at large
relies on the contributions of many. I do not oppose the making or sale of
CDs and books for whatever reason (e.g., personal gain, mitigating
expenses, facilitating the next issue). I view them as one way to actually
increase the likelihood that a greater audience may come in contact with

I'm sufficiently unfamiliar with their work to ask these questions, so
please bear with me.

How many tracks per album?

What would the cost of the album be if purchased as a whole?

Thanks,

Well, at least they kept the 'Necess' in the name!  Otherwise people
might think they were a 'Bare Naked Ladies' cover band!

Misspellings are period! :)

Huzzah to that, Suzanne.

I'm the Entertainment Director for a PA Colonial/RevWar Faire and I had
to work within my budget when deciding what musicians to book...which
is the same process we all go by when deciding what purchases to make.


Did I pay more attention to the $200/hour acts than I did to the free
ones?  Yes, I did (mostly, though, to decide on whether they were worth
booking next year).  Did I appreciate the free ones?  Yes, I did.

Don McLean once said that the more you pay, the more it's worth.  Of
course, that isn't really true:  Each person has their own way of
assigning value to something, but paying *something* is a very real way
of showing gratitude.

I don't want to get into the money side of this that Cammy brought up
right at the moment, but I'm one of those people who likes having
books.  Pieces of paper all look alike; book bindings don't (provided
they're big enough to see on a bookshelf, which I'd say all of yours
have been, Colin.  I won't say the same for Charles Bolton's
_Optimistic_ series, to give a sense of where I'd place that fine
line).

That said, there are dance books that I would love to own, but may
never get around to because every time I look at them, I decide the
cost per dance in the book is just too high.


Christine
p.s.  The cost per dance isn't strictly the cost of the book divided
by the number of dances, but also factors in how many dances in the
book I expect to use.

Since others have seen fit to pass on their responses to Gene to the list,
I'll weigh in with mine here, as well:

Hi Gene,

Some of us have not yet seen fit to get an Ipod.  Technology laggarts (if not
luddites), unite!  I am still perfectly happy to have all of BN's CDs in
their separate jewel boxes, with their attendant informative booklets, and
wouldn't be too interested in buying them all, all over again in iTune form.

It might be very nice to have all of BN in one small device to take on a
really long trip, but I am not convinced, yet, of the usefulness of such for a
mere civilian.

What might the incentive/application be?

I'm actually all for being technologically forward looking (have spawned
techno-savvy kids), and perhaps this would be very useful for a dance leader, but
am not convinced about the usefulness for the rest of us fogies who already
have all the tunes.

My very off-the-cuff two cents,
Deborah

Isn't it okay to have both?  That way, those who want the CD can buy
that and those who just want the MP3s can buy those.

It isn't an either/or, unless the proportion of yeses is such a
majority that it isn't economically feasible to go to all the trouble a
CD requires.

Colin's and Gene's threads are getting intertwined, so keep in mind:

Colin is talking about publishing his dances online INSTEAD of on paper.

Gene is talking about selling tracks off the Boston Centre series IN
ADDITION TO selling the CD's. Though sales of one kind would presumably
cut into the other.

I like having all the choices in the world, of course...personally I'm
probably happy downloading new dances and buying CD's, but not buying
individual songs. I do most things on the computer so I like having
everything I'm using on the hard drive. The free audio clips of the
Boston Centre series are enough for me, and MUCH appreciated!

Paper holds up very well as an archival material and you can read your
new dance book in your cabin. CD's are nice and portable and substantial.
So if the economics work for either question (Colin's or Gene's) I hope
for all of the above.

Thanks for producing these things!

Colin, I don't think it's the fact of the turns being two-hand that
determines the direction of the fig. 8s.  If the 1s, turning 1-1/2 times =

Of course, you can download the instructions from my website and print
them out to read in your cabin.  I've even arranged the DWAD3 page to
print one dance per page (in either letter or A4 size), which was
harder than I expected.

Colin (and others) -

Clearly there are some (nearly) fixed costs -- as well as variable
costs -- in having a batch of books or CDs generated.

Can any of you who've had a book or CD published give us some idea of
what quantity is necessary to be sold just to break even?

With all the design, distribution, packing, shipping, etc., headaches
(and associated mark-ups) is $5, for example, for a downloaded CD or
book a better deal for the author than $15 for a real CD or book?

Deborah,

If you have the CDs already, there is software that you can use to transform
the CDs tracks to MP3 or WMA formats, and at least one of those formats will
run on the iPod.  Since this is considered "fair use" under US Copyright
law, such a conversion for your own use is fair game, without requiring you
to re-download the tracks in an "ipod format".  It's very possible that you
already have the program to "RIP" these tracks off the CDs into MP3s, or
that you could download that program for free.  One such program is called
Windows Media Player.

JB Green

IMHO this publishing issue is not about money--let's be upfront here--there IS no money involved in most ECD enterprises. Sure, 1 or 2 people (the Stephen Kings, so to speak, of the ECD world) will make some bucks, perhaps even enough to live on, but the royalties and payments we're generally talking here--when was the last time an ECD book made the NYTimes Best Seller list?--are not mega-bucks, not even mini-bucks, they're puny-bucks--i.e., if you get some, take the kids (provided that there aren't too many of 'em) out for a one-scoop ice cream cone. And don't lick too fast!
The issue is more about access: do people prefer the relative stability of hard copy books or physical cds versus the more ephemeral pdf download of a dance or a cut-to-burn track to a technology that many of us don't yet master. Paper tends to last; e-files don't--that is why archiving e-stuff is becoming a crisis in library circles. But e-stuff can be somewhat more findable (for the techno-astute) than paper, especially for ephemera, which is what most of us are producing. It all depends on who you think your target market is.
Whoever suggested that the best of both worlds is to have both forms of access is probably correct--it is then up to the Artist to figure out the economics of each transaction. The results of Gene's straw poll should be interesting.

It would be nice to have the tracks available for download.  I might not
get around to using them myself, but I can think of occasions when it woul
be useful to be able to refer others to them.

I hope the CDs would continue to be available as well.

I don't know how the money thing goes with iTunes store, but in terms
of outreach it might turn out to be a good thing to have the entire
collection on there.  I do go there to see if some arcane thing I
want is there from time to time, even though I don't use iTunes to
play CDs when I'm at my computer and don't use portable music devices.

Quite the contrary.  What Katrina and other natural disasters have
shown is that 'e-stuff' *does* tend to last...much more so than paper
and other media.

How much to you think a WTC, tsunami or any hurricane survivor wishes
they'd had a backup of now forever-lost photos?  Or companies that wish
they'd had backups of vital records, computer or otherwise that are now
under several feet of muck?

When you damage a CD, you're screwed.  It's gone and the vendor wants
you to pay full price for another copy, if it's even available (I have
an early Japanese CD edition of 'Dark Side of the Moon' considered the
best mastered edition...it's now going for $100+ on e-bay).  When you
lose an MP3, you just make another copy from your backup (assuming you
made at least one, of course).

Look at it another way.  If you're a caller, which would you rather
lose:  That big box of original CDs you drag to each dance or an
6-ounce MP3 player filled with replaceable MP3 versions of those very
same CDs?

Same is true for dance instructions.  Lug a bunch of cards, notebooks
and books around and hope nobody spills a milkshake on them or do what
I do and have them all on a PDA.

About the money in ECD:  the question is probably more like "Which
format am I going to lose less money with?" :)  Clearly the e-format is
the winner there.

That's a great point, Emily.  Some people may encounter ECD for the

Ah, there speaks a techie, not a librarian. Paper
copies are vulnerable to some things (especially
water) but e-files are vulnerable to others. (Ever had
your hard drive fried?) CDs do deteriorate, while, if
not on acidic paper or in a flood, hard copy lasts for
centuries.

And proudly so, though I appreciate and respect librarians, too.  It's
nearly impossible to be into computers, dance, cooking and history
without becoming an amateur librarian as well. :)

Well, is paper currently in production and readily available likely to
last centuries?  I know even water can be removed from damaged
books...I remember an NPA piece a little time ago about the
'freeze-drying' process of salvaging and restoring Iraqi books and
manuscripts damaged in the US invasion.

A fried hard drive is merely an irritation if regular backups are made.
 And data can often be retrieved from a fried hard drive.

Yes, normal CDs have about a 50-100 year lifespan, as I recall.  Maybe
someone else knows more about their vulnerability, but I think it has
to do with the plastic deteriorating and the aluminum corroding.

I think the best strategy is for a multiple backup, multiple media,
multiple site approach.

I have never seen a hornpipe as Gene describes, but I would be surprised
if the reed were a "free" reed (like in a concertina) rather than a
"beating"
reed (like in a clarinet or oboe or bagpipe). The pitch of a free reed
does
not depend upon the size or shape of the air chamber, so you cannot play
such an instrument by covering "finger holes like a recorder or tin
whistle."
That's why free reed instruments need a different reed for each note.

  For my squeezebox I paid quite a fee
  But it got me to thinking: "Let's see...
     The cost is quite nice
     If you think what the price
  Would have been if the reeds weren't free."

(Yes, mine.)

Aren't I a good citizen by not endlessly copying previous messages in a
thread?

Anyhow... I believe at some point C.Kaynor said something to the effect that
he had decided not to copyright his compositions. Well, I'm only a
librarian, but isn't it the case that the author/ composer (etc.) holds the
copyright, whether he or she does anything about it or not? And wouldn't the
author's heirs retain copyright, likewise?

So whether you want it or not, it's yours. And perhaps your heirs will spend
many decades in court chasing after the millions in royalties they believe
they are owed. Or not.

Or I suppose the author could assign the copyright to some worthy
institution. Here at my library we have separate deed of gift forms,
depending whether the donor is keeping the copyright to the gift, assigning
it to us, or claims no copyright on it. (This last might be a book
collector.) All forms cooked up by our lawyers, not us, so presumably they
are legal.

if you really object to copright existing in your work, can't you include
with it a statement that it is in the public domain and may befreely
copied?

there are also licenses for software intended to keep it in the public
domain - i don't know if these have been applied to other creative works,
but there are many interesting links at

I assume Cammy and others who refer to "not bothering to copyright"
something really mean that they're not registering their copyrighted
material with the government. As you say, the copyright's there whether
you know it or not. You can proclaim your intent that your work be freely
available to all without copyright enforcement, or choose the in-between
option of permitting most reproduction up front but requesting credit.

Copyright is clearly one of those subjects that will come up over and
over on the list, so maybe someone could look up the dates of previous
comprehensive discussions in the archive to have handy for the next time,
and the next...like that scene in an early Woody Allen movie where they
just yell out the number of the punchline and everyone laughs. Not that
I'm trying to keep y'all from talking about it or anything.

1) Acknowledging my own authorship feels like bragging so I try to
under-cite myself unless it is clear I am accepting blame more than
credit.
2) Noting another's authorship is a matter of courtesy so I try to
remember to do it unless the evening is starting to feel like a scholarly
text filled with footnotes. (Although I like to give credit where credit
is due, sometimes I get it wrong about whom to credit so corrections are
also welcomed).
3) Proof of authorship is probably sitting in my notes and rough drafts
and dated Emails or snail mail letters, if anything I do in this life
becomes famous enough for heirs to worry about. (Legally this is probably
not the same as copyright but might make a case for sharing in profits).

As Fae pointed out, this is a repeat thread.

RE: the issue of digital vs. "hard copy" backups.

I think we're confusing two issues: short-time "backup" vs. long-term
archiving.

In the short term, having that spare zip disk, tape cartridge, duplicate
hard disk, whatever, is more convenient and safer than a singular deck of
paper cards or file of paper.

In the long term, I marvel at how I can read an original 11th century text
unaided, but can't read the notes and reports I wrote in 1978 and stored on
my 5.25" floppy disks using what at the time seemed like immortal Micropolis
drives and operating system.

The problem being that digital equipment and formats become obsolete
quickly, and change numerous times over the decades.  Eyeballs evolve more
slowly :-)

Right again!  I was trying keep my original nearly-OT post about this
instrument short and simple... (figured everybody got the picture about the
clarinet with its visible single beating reed...  wish I'd simply said
bagpipe and that would have been the end of it)  So if you've read enough,
stop here.

Yes, right, the correct technical description in various treatises about
hornpipes and such is a single 'beating' reed (as Beth wrote), allowing
pitch to be varied by fingerholes (like a bagpipe chanter, or clarinet), or
by otherwise lengthen/shortening the tube (like the drones). The design of
the single free reeds in squeezeboxes is indeed different than the beating
read..

I did stretch the scope of "free reed" (sorry...David's right about their
properties) so we could give those
accordionists _some_ justification to escape the injunction: "Play an
accordion, go to jail.  It's the law."    Anyone who'd like to read a cogent
overview of types of reeds and wind instruments could check out:
http://62.1911encyclopedia.org/R/RE/REED_INSTRUMENTS.htm

Ain't this list fun?  Now back to our regularly scheduled discussions of the
meaning of "siding."

Gene
A "gentleman" who can play the accordion, but doesn't.  Now if I could play
like some of the English dance-band accordionists...

any community, such as ECD, in which many people create intellectual
property, including composing dances, music, performing... even writing
about it all.

And opinions have widely differed (as the recent discussion has showed) over
proper use, accrediting, etc., of the creative work of others in the
community. There is no consensus, or only a weak one. Further, there has
been no "comprehensive" discussion, because law and practice in this area
are changing all the time. As witness authors suing the Univ of Michigan
over its contacts with Google. That'll be fun.

And if "repeat threads" were banned from this list, there wouldn't be
anything to talk about. I mean, really.

By the way, the librarian chatter these days is that the most stable medium
which we have available at the moment is microfilm. "Stable" meaning both
"slow to deteriorate," and "likely to remain readable with available
equipment for quite a while." Then we all ruefully shake our heads because
everybody hates using or producing microfilm copies.

Would that be steel or aluminum siding?

P.S. would it have been any better if I had asked Crescent or Straight
siding?

I wasn't here for the long debates about copyright (I've read some in the
archives) and have no desire to ban repeat threads. I noticed that some
people are still tired of the subject from last time and just wanted to
help with that -- and you're right that it's not a settled area. I guess
I was thinking along the lines of an informal FAQ...

Apologies at the outset fot eh length of this diatribe :-)

     First, could we please establish that Arthur and Marjorie's
surname was Heffer, and not Heffner.

     I did not refer to Arthur Heffer as "Father" - but I did refer
to W. S.Porter as "Father Porter" - he was a high Anglican priest,
and was generally known thus.
The Heffers were, as far as I know, responsible for the choreography
of the Apted Book dances, with Father Porter arranging the tunes for
the piano (and I think his piano arrangements are extremely good,
better than Sharp's in many cases, as he provides a better bass line).

     I do not feel they offered the dances as slavish transcriptions
of their C18th originals. Perusal of their Preface reveals the
following:
     "The selection of tunes has been a further problem; but since,
in the original, the connection between tune and dance seems
generally quite fortuitous, the Editors have not scrupled to replace
a poor tune by a better one from the same collection, when this could
be done without materially altering the dance. ............

     In the interpretation of the dances themselves some latitude has
also been found necessary. The original instructions are always brief
and often vague; frequently the movements given do not fit the music.
Actual alteration of the figures has been avoided as far as possible,
but in several cases the original instructions have been expanded and
supplemented, as will be seen from the notes appended to each dance.
Something of the same sort must have been done by the dancing-masters
of the C18th.

     The original dances are, without exception, triple-minor
progressives for as many as will, but where - as frequently happens -
the third couple takes almost no part in the figure, the Editors have
not hesitated to re-arrange the dance for duple-minor sets. And they
have suggested, in many cases, an alternative arrangement as a set
dance for three couples. .............. It should be added that, in
every case, the directions as here set down have been carefully
tested by experienced dancers, for whose co-operation the editors
wish to express their sincere gratitude."

I feel the above is very much in the spirit of Tom Cook's:
     "The accompanying dances are neither completely new inventions
nor exact translations of the originals. The former would have been
superfluous at best, and in my view the latter would have created two
problems if attempted. First the popularity of Country (that is,
Social) Dancing in the C18th led then, as again i the C20th, to the
devising of a technical shorthand for dance notation which in the
absence of visual aids is always short of detail, often ambiguous,
and at times obscure. Cecil sharp rightly insisted that we cannot now
say with certainty on very point "this is how it was done", and
choice between two possible meanings is normally required when
reconstructing for use today. Secondly, social conventions and needs
have altered, and there is now no pleasure (for example) in a
longways dance in which all except the first couple are inactive. For
me, fossilised Folk is valuable but dead. And so here are modern, or
modernised, but still recognisably derived forms of the dances,
containing unlike the tunes much personal
interpretation. ......." (foreword to 'Come let's be merry') and
"The accompanying dances however, though always based on the
originals, are not invariably an attempt at a straight translation
into modern language. Often they are interpretations and adaptations
intended as i hope to fit better the changed social conditions of the
C20th. ..... " (foreword to 'Again let's be merry'). Tom also says
the same things in his forewords to 'Hunters Moon' and 'Packington's
Pound'.

     Charles Bolton has produced a whole series of 'Retreads' books,
containing 'filled out' versions of C17th and C18th dances with the
intention of making them more interesting for today's dancers' palates.

     Ken Sheffield in his 'From two barns' series of books says
things like "To nine of these (tunes) have been added interpretations
or modifications of the dances which were set to them .... " And
again "There is no suggestion that the versions in this book are 'the
correct ones'." (Have a look at the original instructions for 'Sun
Assembly' - they are fairly surprising)

     So, after all that (!), I do not feel that the Apted book is
presented as slavish transcriptions, any more than Tom Cook, Charles
Bolton or Ken Sheffield present their 'discoveries' as such.

     "Would we allow anyone to do this today?" Well, it seems we do!
And anyway, who has the right to regulate what researchers do with
what they find? As Douglas Kennedy said in his Foreword to 'Maggot
Pie': "Who knows what may be their (the dances) ultimate fate? Some
may die after a short existence. Others may live to be collected,
having survived the testing process of time ..... " Here, he was
speaking of a set of modern compositions, but the same may well be
applied to transcriptions of older dances; if they work and dancers
like them, they will survive; but some will not prove popular and
will sink into obscurity. Who now does, for instance, 'Love lies a-
bleeding' or 'The catching of Fleas'? (replies on a postcard from
groups whose favourite dances these are, please!!!!); yet Cecil Sharp
thought well enough of them to publish them.

     Tom Cook's 'Irish Lamentation' is hugely popular, with its
totally anachronistic waltz round at the end, and Sharp's 2 B music
version of Mr Bev. still seems to hold sway in the USA, despite Pat
Shaw's version having almost eliminated the Sharp version in Britain.

     And if you go back 354 years to 'The English Dancing Master',
and look at 'Fain I would if I could' you find, according to Margaret
Dean Smith, the dance "directed to be performed 'as at Oxford' ",
which would seem to imply that there were different interpretations
of dances current in the middle of the C17th. Ah, well, plus ca
change ......

Colin:

Your's is a good question: there is something called the 'digital divide.'
It relates to "haves" and "have-nots." Many people don't have access to
the Net and are, thereby, left out.

HOWEVER, in my experience, nearly all English country dancers in my area
have access to the Internet. So many have email addresses that this
becomes the principal way that many of us communicate about dance events.

BUT, I still buy books such as yours: I like printed matter. Call my old
fashioned or a Luddite but nothing quite compares to the printed page, not
even stuff printed from pdfs . . . the quality of paper, etc., is not as
great. I believe such things will not have lasting value, e.g., ink from
ink-jet printers is commonly water soluable.

So, in balance, I hope you still produce your books. I personally have as
special liking for companion sets of music on CD and books of dances.

Best regards from the other side of the pond,

/Roger

Heffers: ah yes: and the eponymous bookstore in Cambridge, which the
husband's family owned. I've read more by Arthur Heffer (1899-1931), than by
his wife, who was nicknamed Barney for no reason I remember. Arthur died of
the long-term effects of his WWI service (gassed, I think) in late 1931.
When I was working on Rolf Gardiner's papers, at Cambridge U., I dropped in
on the Cambridgeshire Folk Museum. A case had a set of morris bells, with a
note from a school event in 1931, saying something like "Mr Heffer will
dance a jig." Alas.

He was a close friend of Rolf Gardiner in the 1920s. Both were founders of
the Cambridge Morris Men and the Travelling Morrice. I recall, from reading
their correspondence, that at some point in the 1920s, 1926 or 1927?,
Gardiner, staunchly anti-American, as only a leading figure in the German
Jugendbewegung (Youth Movement) could be, expressed outrage that Barney was
stooping so low as travelling to America to teach the Americans about dance.

Which Heffer was active in ECD? Probably Barney.

Gardiner translated Playford dances into German in the 1920s, by the way.
Also taught morris dances to the SS in the 1930s, but heck, that's another
story.

I know this is Tired Old Topic #1, but I hope you'll
let me vent. No need to reply or start a new thread!
I was at a dance festival over the weekend and
overheard some women talking about rough dancing by
the men, how to let them know you've been hurt, and so
on.
Then a man sitting with them said, "Well, you know
there's another side to this problem. I'm always
having women complain that I've hurt them dancing,
when I haven't really done anything."
At this point, I got up and left, so as not fall into
the temptation of smacking him on the face (or
somewhere even more sensitive) so I could tell him
that I hadn't really done anything to hurt him....
This is the problem in a nutshell, isn't it? Here's a
guy who's been told more than once that he's hurt
someone with his dancing style. And instead of trying
to change, or even acknowledging that he has a
problem, he blames the victim for being too sensitive.
OK, OK, some women are rough, too....

Melanie,
As old a topic as this is, personally I welcome it because frequent
reminders are needed in any activity where many people are thinking mostly
of their own enjoyment and not enough of the others'. You say very
succinctly -
"This is the problem in a nutshell, isn't it? Here's a
guy who's been told more than once that he's hurt
someone with his dancing style. And instead of trying
to change, or even acknowledging that he has a
problem, he blames the victim for being too sensitive.
OK, OK, some women are rough, too...."

I would add that
although some people are extraordinarily sensitive or delicate we should
endeavor to compensate with our dancing style because we certainly don't
wish them to have an unpleasant time. It behooves all of us to become
adept at recognizing which styles of dancing bring pain, embarrassment,
confusion, and which bring enjoyment to our partners and neighbors in the
set; often with only split seconds to assess the situation. The better
skilled we are at sensing others' druthers (I like how those words fit
together) the more people will like to dance with us and the more people
will enjoy dancing in general.

Cammy (who has transgressed in every way imaginable on the dance floor but
whose intention is always to make the dancing enjoyable to those around,
and who continually strives to be more perceptive, and has often thanked
those who have shared their displeasure with my shenanigans and revised my
style accordingly)

Heffers: ah yes: and the eponymous bookstore in Cambridge, which the
husband's family owned. I've read more by Arthur Heffer (1899-1931), than by
his wife, who was nicknamed Barney for no reason I remember. Arthur died of
the long-term effects of his WWI service (gassed, I think) in late 1931.
When I was working on Rolf Gardiner's papers, at Cambridge U., I dropped in
on the Cambridgeshire Folk Museum. A case had a set of morris bells, with a
note from a school event in 1931, saying something like "Mr Heffer will
dance a jig." Alas.

He was a close friend of Rolf Gardiner in the 1920s. Both were founders of
the Cambridge Morris Men and the Travelling Morrice. I recall, from reading
their correspondence, that at some point in the 1920s, 1926 or 1927?,
Gardiner, staunchly anti-American, as only a leading figure in the German
Jugendbewegung (Youth Movement) could be, expressed outrage that Barney was
stooping so low as travelling to America to teach the Americans about dance.

Which Heffer was active in ECD? Probably Barney.

Gardiner translated Playford dances into German in the 1920s, by the way.
Also taught morris dances to the SS in the 1930s, but heck, that's another
story.

This is not really OT for an English list because we hope to lure in
contra refugees. And we may also hope to satisfy people who like vigorous
dancing within an English dance instead of sending them over to contras.
(In America, anyway.) But it's really contra dancing that hurts.

I know some people have been working on improving this for years, and
there are lots of approaches that help. The aspect that interests me is,
how do you get the gorillas to come to the workshop? I'm thinking along
the lines of a "Dance Pain-Free Forever" workshop that would focus on the
relaxed, low-torque, low-friction movement mechanics that underly a lot
of good style. Would a mention of causing less pain and becoming a more
popular partner attract them? Or maybe offer free bananas...

I bet there's still plenty of life in this topic!

The Springhead page you bookmarked explains this quote from Roy Moxham's
book "Tea" (Moxham worked in Nyasaland (today's Malawi) for a tea planter in
the 1950's and records this remembrance):
 "The planters' ire was directed toward Rolf gardiner, who came out from
time to time. He was viewed as dangerously symphathetic to the Africans, and
liable to involve the industry in unnecessary expense if others had to
follow his example.  He was denounced as ridiculous when he paid for a group
of African farmers to visit his estate in Dorset to study his aforestation
and organic agriculture.  Any wider influence he might have had was
destroyed by rumors of his past involvement with the Hitler Youth".

I may, in fact, be such a "contra refugee."  Some years ago, I began to
consider defection to the kinder, gentler art of ECD, after an overly exuberant and
apparently self-involved contradancer slammed into my right shoulder, which
reacted with an audible "POP!"

Fortunately, my body parts apparently arighted themselves without lasting
damage, but it did give me pause and the resultant attitude that contra dancing
is for those who prefer contact sports.  Which hold ever less appeal to me
these days.

Besides, I really do like the ECD music, which one contra fiddler derisively
referred to as "tinkle, tinkle music."

Cheer,
Deborah

Hi folks,

I was looking at the NOMAD website at www.nomadfest.org and I'm a little
confused at the information presented.  I'm hoping someone planning to go
(or who has been) might clarify some things for me.

1. The Festival says it's from Saturday 10a to 11p, and Sunday 11a to 5p.
But there's reference to a Friday dance.  What is the time, duration, and
type of dancing done on Friday?  Is it worth coming in a day early in order
to attend this?

2. There are a number of hotels mentioned on the website.  Are these within
walking distance of the festival or do you need additional transportation?

3. In addition to the listed hotels, I heard about another place which is
something of a time capsule called the Duncan Hotel.  Apparently it's no
frills but a lot of old fashioned character.  Can anyone give me any
feedback pro or con?

4. Are there any other "unofficial" activities at the festival I should be
aware of or bring anything for?

Thanx in advance for any information.  Feel free to reply off-list if you
prefer.

Thanx, Ric Goldman

<<I know this is Tired Old Topic #1, but I hope you'll
let me vent. No need to reply or start a new thread!
I was at a dance festival over the weekend and
overheard some women talking about rough dancing by
the men, how to let them know you've been hurt, and so
on.
Then a man sitting with them said, "Well, you know
there's another side to this problem. I'm always
having women complain that I've hurt them dancing,
when I haven't really done anything."
At this point, I got up and left, so as not fall into
the temptation of smacking him on the face (or
somewhere even more sensitive) so I could tell him
that I hadn't really done anything to hurt him....
This is the problem in a nutshell, isn't it? Here's a
guy who's been told more than once that he's hurt
someone with his dancing style. And instead of trying
to change, or even acknowledging that he has a
problem, he blames the victim for being too sensitive.
OK, OK, some women are rough, too....>>

The problem is, in a way, that he really *hadn't* done anything, at least
not something that would likely have been damaging to him. So he's following
a version of the Golden Rule -- the version which states, "Do unto others as
you'd have them do unto you."

Except, of course, that he was doing unto others who were almost certainly
of a different size and strength, to whom his actions are damaging. Most
contra dances, and some English dances, have their share of large, vigorous
guys who are skilled dancers in some ways, but are not able to put
themselves into the shoes of a smaller person or one with less muscle
strength. So they hurt people, and they really don't realize it, since after
all, the same action wouldn't have hurt *them*.

Peace,
Paul (a small guy)

Those strong, boisterous guys who are good dancers are a minor part of
the problem, I think. If you ask them, they don't have much fun if they
can't crank up the intensity -- and they just wear you down rather than
doing specific things that actively hurt.

Any dancer can bend your wrist over in an allemande, hang on your arms in
a swing (women), torque out your shoulder in a twirl (especially out of a
swing)...I'm sure there's more to this list. My own pet peeve, because I
haven't found a defense against it, is that swing move where people
suddenly push on your back to make you spin. From my point of view that's
a completely unwelcome, often harmful, chiropractic adjustment.
Everything else I can pretty much deal with, and I'm getting good at
snatching my hand away with a smile (bad shoulder).

There's also plenty of awareness of these issues on the floor, as
previously impervious dancers finally get old enough to get their first
injuries. I'm glad the "slow gear" is coming back into contra dancing,
which really lacked variety for a while (in many places in North
America)...and since traditional English dances are such an opportunity
to fool around, they allow some latitude to change hands or skip swings
etc.

Paul's observation that there are

<vigorous guys who are skilled dancers in some ways, but are not able to =
put
themselves into the shoes of a smaller person or one with less muscle
strength. So they hurt people, and they really don't realize it, since =

is probably quite accurate.  But as I understand Melanie's original
description we are talking here about men who *have been told, =
explicitly*
that the way they dance irritates -- or even injures -- others, as a =
matter
of routine.  To my way of thinking, anyone who doesn't take immediate =
steps
to find out how to change his dancing so it doesn't have that effect is =
a
long way from following any interpretation of the Golden Rule.  I'm sure
that if the guy in question wound up dancing with some one  much larger =
&
stronger than he, he wouldn't want his partner to ignore, much less
deliberately violate, his comfort, never mind safety.  What =
justification is
there for allowing such willfully dangerous dancers on the floor?

As I see it, the problem has little to do with size, strength, or
differences in tolerance for degrees of roughness. It has everything to do
with someone not noticing that their actions are hurting someone else and
even worse, not believing it when told point blank that they had caused
pain!
Not noticing is something we all do on occasion (but strive to get better
at). Not responding with corrective action to a direct communication seems
to verge on belligerent behavior to me.

The Golden Rule governs the lowest possible setting of the behavior bar.
It is entirely egocentric and does not acknowledge the concept of
consideration for others. A better Golden Rule for the dance floor would
be to "do unto others as THEY would have you do unto THEM."

"Do unto others as you'd have them do unto you" should be reserved for
moments when you are trying to set an example or communicate preferences
in style (nonverbally).

Good stuff, Campbell.

When presented with several complaints, that guy should have understood
that he was doing something wrong.

But once should have been enough.  No one should ever get hurt by
someone else while dancing.

Dancing may be the biggest testosterone boost some guys get all week,
but they need to understand that -- just like 'no means no' -- 'ouch
means ouch'.

As Melanie no doubt knew as she composed her post, she's "preaching to the choir" here.  We know and understand the issue.  I'm at that awkward stage in contra and ECD--I think I know what I'm doing.  Often as not, I'm reminded I don't really know enough, yet.

One thing I have picked up in both ECD and contra is eye contact.  When I'm looking my dance partner in the eye, or at the very least observing him/her, then I'm going to be aware if they are enjoying themselves, confused, or even in pain.  I would think that if I weren't able recognize these feelings in my dance partner then I wouldn't truely be dancing with them.  It shouldn't be too much to expect any dancer to be aware of how to treat another dancer just by being aware of them.  The initial feeling of a hand grip during an allemande, or a balance before a swing, tells me if my partner needs me to go easy, or let loose and fly.

One thing has assisted me more than any caller's instructions has been gender-free dancing.  I am aware of how I have been lead by other dancers.  Then when I'm leading I try to emulate what helped me when I was being led.  When a dancer is limited to only dancing on one side of a couple, they never experience how to give, and receive, cues and commentary on the execution of a dance move.

This works both ways, too.  I pulled my right calf muscle at dance camp last weekend.  At last Tuesday's CDNY ECD I was feeling somewhat better and was almost able to set on the balls of my feet.  Skipping was out.  One dance ended with a two hand turn which the caller allowed could be twice around if desired.  I'm usually up to adding a component like that.  One woman, with whom I've had the pleasure of adding something extra to dances with in the past, gave enough weight for us to get around twice.  Forgetting myself for a moment, I followed her lead.  My leg couldn't take the strain and I stumbled.  I was very careful to give less weight to my neighbors for the rest of the sets in that dance.  Giving less weight didn't encourage anyone else to attempt a faster turn with me.

If only this dancer, that Melanie mentioned, would one day find himself being lead by strong, uncaring, unaware, dance partner, he might begin to understand what he's been inflicting upon other dancers.

a few thoughts, hopefully generic to dancing such that it would
include ECD as well as other dance forms.

1. it's ironic and amusing to me that i (really) began english
dancing because i wasn't enjoying the contradancing in the
geographical area where i'd moved to live for a couple years.
when i went to the local contra dance, it was too overwhelming a
concept to consider being proactive with contra dancers who i
didn't know, when i was the new person in their crowd.  i found
the english dancers in general to be more respectful, gentler,
and more welcoming than the contra dancers (at that time,
especially in that geographical area).  for the most part, i
haven't had issues with "rough" dancers at ECD.

2. before i left my home area and after i moved back, i had
essentially divided up "rough" contradancers into two
categories: people who i basically liked and thought i'd enjoy
dancing with but for an issue here or there, and people who i
basically thought i'd never actually want to dance with, even if
the issues were solved.

3. for those in category #1, i have generally attempted to have
a conversation, along the lines of this: "i really enjoy dancing
with you, but when you/we do X, it hurts me in Y way.  so for
this reason, it would be really helpful it you/we could avoid
doing X when we dance.  is there a way to make this happen?"  my
experience is that the conversation goes very simply and easily,
the person and i have frequently become regular dance partners,
and i get hurt much less frequently.  examples of things that
i've mentioned are allemande styles, swing holds, and twirls.

4. unfortunately, i think that the category #2 dancers are more
likely to be perceived as difficult by more than just me -- and
i find them to be more difficult to imagine approaching with
something like this, partly because i have no real motivation (i
don't see them as someone who i'm going to want to dance with),
and perhaps partly because the issues seem more deeply rooted,
maybe more personality-driven.  and so those dancers go without
getting the feedback that might help them, and the community as
a whole.

5. in thinking about all this while writing up this post, i
realized that i had come up with a category #3: dancers who are
not "rough", per se, but rather are in some way a bit
inappropriate.  the touch or a squeeze lingers a bit too much
here, or something strays a bit too far over some unwritten line
there...  i find myself internally shuddering in response and
for the most part unable to *imagine* approaching those subjects
with the dancers in question.  it was issues like this that
mostly led me to try ECD, where the physical contact was more
limited and at a greater distance overall.  i honestly have no
idea what sort of feedback would be helpful in situations like
this were i to be able to give it, or even to whom it would be
useful.  (ironically, of course, i have come to love ECD for its
own sake, as much as i still love contra dancing when it's
good.)

i'm not trying to be pretentious here; i think my feedback, if i
could give it, would be as non-judgmental as possible and
motivated toward helping everyone involved have more fun.  does
anyone have thoughts on how to give feedback in situations like
any of these?  have people had any difficulties during ECD with
"rough" dancers?  have people (women, i'm thinking especially)
figured out ways to deal with inappropriate dancers?

thanks,

melissa

I have never had this problem in ecd--I have had trouble at contra dances
where the fact that my hand was covered in bandages has not necessarily
made people realize they shouldn't grab it --but I'd like to throw out two
related issues:

One friend of mine has complained that contra dancers in this area have
become so sensitive about this, and also so careful about timing, that few
of them twirl anymore, and she misses it.  I quite like some twirling, too,
if there is time and I don't get thrown around, but a lot of younger men
seem to assume that we middle-aged dancers like to be sedate all the time.
Similarly, I like to turn _very_ fast in "Yellow stockings," but I don't
know how to convince men (assuming they would enjoy it) except by being
pushy.

At a dance this summer I was accused of having hurt another dancer while
drawing her into a circle (trying to keep the set from falling apart) --not
by the "victim," but by someone else, who was quite harsh about it and left
me feeling really bad.  But the person supposedly hurt did not seem to mind
dancing with me later, while the person who accused me turned out to have a
pretty mean tongue more generally.  How does one react to this?

In general, I'd like to suggest the the 20 second negotiation at some
point  between the beginning of the walk-through and the start of the
dance. Assuming your partner has some experience, you can say "how
about using xxxx on those turns". In "Yellow Stockings" you're
turning with corner, so you can only talk to your first corner in
advance, but by holding your hands correctly you can indicate what
you like. Most men with experience will oblige you, I would think.


If the dance has a nice bit I like to do, but that is often
overlooked or not used, I try to discuss it with partner before we
start.
Best,
  Terry

my local dance community has wrestled with this from time to time.  i
don't claim to have definitive answers, but here are a few ideas:

- something along the lines of your approach to negotiating with dancers
in "category 1" might be a good first step: "when you do X, it makes me
uncomfortable" or "i am not comfortable being held so close".

- compare experiences with other women regarding the men in category #3.

- speak to the organizers if a dancer behaves inappropriately toward you
in a way that you are unable to address with them directly.

if they are bothering you, chances are they are bothering others.

as a last resort, organizers have a right to refuse admission to someone
who won't desist from behavior that is inappropriate or hurtful to others.
(the inclusivity of our kind of social dancing is one of the great things
about it, and i feel strongly that banning a dancer should not be done
lightly.)

oh, my, I know just what you mean:  dancers (of either
gender) who cross the boundary of (to me) acceptable
behavior on the dance floor.  I like to think we act
with a certain civility when we dance - politeness,
gentleness, flirting with the eyes (but not leering)
rather than the hands.  Pawing & stroking just aren't
part of that.  Even if I'm not the one being pawed,
I'm uncomfortable seeing such behavior on the dance
floor.

I haven't figured out what to do.  I've queried
others, & found that there are again three classes:
#1 - those who enjoy being pawed
#2 - those who don't mind
#3 - those (like me) who find it inappropriate and
offensive, even to observe.

I've heard people say, "so-and-so should be banned
from xyz for this behavior!"  It hasn't happened, of
course... Perhaps no one has actually approached the
offending individual to say, "this behavior is
offensive a number of the people here."

I don't have any solutions (not having the temerity to
beard the lion).  Just adding to the venting.

I enjoy experimenting with interpretation of instruction, delving into the
interplay between social interactions and art, exploring nuances and
patterns that have been overlook or misinterpreted for centuries and so
forth. This is a risky business and in the process I am fairly certain
that I have erred in all the ways mentioned from inappropriate to rough.
And yet it has never been my intention to do otherwise than enhance the
experience for those around me and if I am successful, my own enjoyment is
also enhanced. So I watch and listen and try to pick up from body language
etc... how my own dancing is effecting the people around me. I don't
expect everyone to love the things I do, but even if it is not everyone's
cup of tea I hope they may think "how cool that ECD draws such a variety
of characters."

As far as inappropriate actions, I would expect that different individuals
draw different lines as to what is appropriate and what is not just as
they do with what is "rough" and what is not. However, Deb points out an
important additional aspect. Behavior that is enjoyed by the individuals
who are dancing may cause discomfort to observers not in the immediate
vicinity.
As I have stated other times, I view what we are doing in ECD or contra is
creating group art. Everyone present is the artist and this requires a
whole-scene awareness in order to synchronize our efforts. I do not equate
synchrony with uniformity in any way. Our differences and diversity and
contrasting contributions can add richness and be as synchronous a part of
the art as the things we do in unison. But if we are working against each
other rather than collaborating on a truly inspired evening of dance, then
it detracts from the whole effect. That is why it is especially important
that we maintain that awareness of how the whole room full of dancers,
musicians, and caller is going about their individual roles in order to
better craft our own piece. Despite the fact that each individual comes to
the dance for different reasons and with different hopes, it is not hard
to identify common ground and build something pleasing to all.

Having admitted I transgress, let me offer an apology to any I have
offended and reiterate that my inappropriatenesses were meant to spice up
and flatter rather than pain or cause discomfort.
Secondly, it is never easy to receive criticism (particularly because of
the guilt we feel at being exposed as too insensitive to have detected the
problem without a direct communication). Nonetheless I have been told such
a thing as "you hurt me when I danced in your set last time" and I
accepted the remark with an apology, encouragement to speak up if it
should ever happen again, and adjustments in my behavior/style to make
certain that the problem was not experienced again. Such an exchange has
changed the relationship I had with more than one dancer from a situation
where they were avoiding me and I hadn't a clue why to one where we have
enjoyed many fine dances together.
Lastly, I often use Terry's suggestion of sorting out some things in
advance. I often ask my partner whether they like vigorous swings, fancy
swings, sedate and smooth swings, etc... before launching into a contra.
That still leaves the others in the set to figure out but at least I know
how to start off at giving my partner a really fine time.

I can try; I'm doing a couple of sessions.  Hopefully Barbara or one
of the other organizers can fill in more details.

8:00-10:30 Friday Night Contra Dance.  Whether that's worth it depends
on how much you like contra, I suppose.

The flyer also cites two other Friday non-NOMAD events: Three Finger
Poi (I gather that's a musical group) at the St. John's Coffeehouse
and ECD at the Neighborhood Music School.

None of those are within walking distance unless you have a taste for really
long walks.  The New Haven bus system will probably get you from most of them
to NOMAD, but it will involve at least one change of bus.

I haven't stayed there myself, since I live locally, but the report I
have from a friend who did about two years ago was that it was noisy
and, quote, a dump.  On the other hand, it was about $40 a night.
That was November of 2003, however, and prices seem to have risen.
Other hotels in that general neighborhood with a better ambiance would
include the Colony Inn, the New Haven Hotel, and the Omni.  All of
these will be significantly pricier.

Not that anyone ever tells me about!  :)

Allison:

It isn't in the Spring, but you may be thinking of a post for the Victory at
Yorktown Celebration Ball to be held November 11, 2006 in Worcester, MA.

As Jack pointed out, there are others in the talking or hoping stages, but
"The Ladies of Refined Taste" have been planning this one for many months,
and have already held workshops on dress-making, deportment, etc.

One of the "ringleaders" is Rhondda McKinnon, who may be contacted through
this website:

Hi all,

I'm looking at the Fallibroome (2) interpretation of Love and a Bottle, and
am baffled by the A1.  It's a 3 cpl LW set, for those who don't happen to
have their Fallibroomes handy.

A1: 1st man fig.8 through the 2nd and 3rd men, as 1st woman does a fig. 8
through the 2nd couple (1st woman crossing in front of her partner).

It seems that there is a terrible traffic jam between the 2nd and 3rd men
as both of the 1s are trying to get through at the same time, and that it's
a really odd choice of paths for the 1st man (does he go to the right or
left of the 2nd man?).  Does anyone have any words of wisdom about this
move?  Modifications?  Does anyone do this with the 1s just doing a whole
figure 8 around the 2s?  I like the tune a lot, and can always use more 3
couple set dances (we're a tiny group out here in Sebastopol), but this one
seems a little squirrelly.

Kalia

That's what I remember too. BACDS has directions from their 2002 ball
(with the mirror hey) at
http://www.bacds.org/events/fallball2002/dances.htm. The two-hand turn is
a hustle -- there's no time -- but once learned the dance goes with a
nice swing. Fixed up, it's fun!

In Andrew Shaw's interpretation, there is no traffic jam.

1st woman goes FIRST: she passes clockwise around 2nd man and ccw around 2nd woman: she's doing a
full figure of 8 around the 2s. 1st man, having let her take the lead, passes cw around 2nd man
and ccw around 3rd man and back around 2nd man cw. They meet in 1st place proper.

As I recall, "Apricocks and Furbelows" also has this figure, but I find the tune less winning.

There's an earlier dance (1699) with the same name and (I think)
different instructions and music.  Don't have it handy, but it's in a
book of ECDs published in Ireland.  It has a fun sequence where the men
kiss the women's hands and the women mimic knockin' back a shot from a
bottle.

Thanks all for the suggestions.  I think for the moment I'll go with the
mirror-hey variant.  I'd like to try the other one at some point, though,
just to see what they were up to.

I think you'll find that Andrew merely does Bernard Bentley's
interpretation :-) He did have quite a lot to do with Bernard, albeit
I think some time after Bernard had published the Fallibroome books.
Anyway, from what you describe, that is what I did many years ago (in
the '60s probably), and certainly would be my reading of Bernard's
instructions.

I agree that this is what Bentley (as well as the original) seems to say, and I am quite ready to
believe that Andrew does not believe the reading I describe to be unique to him--nevertheless,
Boston and other communities "read" the Fallibroome as a more common sort of mirror-wise hey, and
it was from Andrew that I learned the opening figure as I described it.
