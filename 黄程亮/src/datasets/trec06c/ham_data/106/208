Hi,

initial lag problem solved!!!

Johnathan's suggestion of changing the codec worked--now using Microsoft Video 1
as opposed to Techsmith.

We also changed the color from 16bit 256 colors.


So now we have no lag and didn't even need to use the <ml> parameter.




Thanks very much to Andy and Johnathan for all their help!




Carrie
