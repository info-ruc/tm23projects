   Your input devices probably don't have standard names, usually the case 
it it's not an english version of XP.  You can try the #mouse and #keyboard 
devices but any mappings that the demo makes won't be functioning as 
signals like +F are now +#33.  Safemode 1 will allow DMDX to be ESCaped 
from under such circumstances (as would a couple of cntrl-alt-dels).
