I am trying to run DMDX on a Toshiba laptop with Windows XP.  I have attempted to run the features.rtf from the Demos file.  Initially, I see the instructions and I can use the space bar to go to the next page.  However, once the word/non-word appears none of the inputs work (right click, left click, F, G, H).  Even when I try to escape, there is no response.  I have to shut down the computer in order to get out of the program.  Any thoughts on what is going on and how to remedy it?  Thanks.
