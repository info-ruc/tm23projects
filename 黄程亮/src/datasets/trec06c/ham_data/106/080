   Yeah, it's entirely possible that scramble still has a lulu or two in 
there.  The code wasn't written by me and when it was written getting it 
working was considered nothing short of miraculous.  I've cleaned up most 
of the nasties but I know of at least one oddity that remains that I 
consider not worth going after given the risk of further perturbing that 
piece of code...

                                                /"\
  -jonathan (j.c.f.)                            \ /
                                                 X

   Failure is never fatal and success is never final.
