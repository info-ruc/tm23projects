   Could be anything from some daft codec error message about having to 
download some new software to an incompatible video mode (I don't recommend 
256 color video modes at all) or a play back rectangle that the codec 
doesn't like (left corner isn't left of the right corner or it's size is 
too big or too small).  Or something else I've never seen, the sky's the 
limit with video.  TimeDX has a Digital Video test that you can use to play 
the files that are busting DMDX and hopefully you'll get some better 
diagnostics out of it.
