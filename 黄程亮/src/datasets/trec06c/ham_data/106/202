The Society for Risk Analysis is sponsoring a day-long workshop  

    What Monte Carlo Cannot Do:
    Introduction to Imprecise Probabilities

on Sunday, 4 December 2005, before its annual meeting at the
Lake Buena Vista Palace Resort near Orlando, Florida.

The workshop will introduce interval-valued probability and
imprecisely specified probability distributions and review
their uses in risk analysis. It will introduce the approaches
of interval probabilities, robust Bayes methods, probability
bounds analysis, Dempster-Shafer theory, and the theory of
imprecise probabilities. It will also illustrate how imprecise
or incomplete data can be used to fashion inputs for these
models.

See the website at http://www.ramas.com/iporlando.htm for more
information.

Best regards,
Scott
