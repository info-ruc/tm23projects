   It's your backslash.  I'm impressed at the way it's breaking the parser 
but for DMDX syntax it is a little malformed.  You need to have a new line 
after your backslash:

>0"READY - PRESS SPACEBAR";$
>
>\+11901<ln -3>"have",
>
><ln -2>"bike",

It needs to be like this:

>0"READY - PRESS SPACEBAR";$
>
>\
>
>+11901<ln -3>"have",
>
><ln -2>"bike",
