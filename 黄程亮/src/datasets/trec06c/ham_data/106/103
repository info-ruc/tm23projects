Dear Friends, 

This is FYI. Please notice that interval mathematics is one of the topics mentioned in the call for papers. I am planning to go, and if we can organize an interval session that will be great, please let me know if you are interested, we must send it session proposal by December 10. 

This conference is back-toback with IMPU'06 in Paris July 2-7, 2006.
