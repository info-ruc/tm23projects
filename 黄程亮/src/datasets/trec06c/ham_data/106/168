I guess if you were using <cr> and <delay> then that you could be your 
problem if it's always the first frame of the item that's late:

08/08/05 j.c.f. 3.1.4.1 <cr> with <delay> made rigorous (<c> with <delay> 
was already)
06/06/05 j.c.f. 3.1.4.0 <zol>
06/03/05 j.c.f. 3.1.3.0 background sound
05/24/05 j.c.f. 3.1.2.7 item_read() spews item during early errors, makes 
misplaced keyword at start of item easier to debug
03/30/05 j.c.f. 3.1.2.6 machinename only tries to READ registry computer 
name for limited access machines

If you really need a fixed ITI then you'll have to make the delay larger, 
looking at the preparation times will tell you how long the delay needs to be:

A lot of people are using <d> when there's no call for it, if they don't 
like the default half second or so between trials then they can use a 
negative value for the delay which will avoid display errors.
