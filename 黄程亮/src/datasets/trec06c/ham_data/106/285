Welcome Back !  Hope you had a great summer and are looking forward to an 
exciting new year with the UO.
 
We are contacting students who have taken one or more of the SAPP (Substance 
Abuse Prevention Program) term long or short courses in the past.  
Hopefully, you had a good experience and will consider registering with us 
this academic year as well.  You can stop by our office (180 Esslinger 
Hall), e-mail , or telephone us (346-4135), or access our Website ( 
http://sapp.uoregon.edu/ ) to find a current list of the full term offerings 
and 1-credit week-end seminars.  
 
New this year for SAPP are several new topics and instructors.  Also, we now 
offer a practicum for students interested in providing "peer counseling" in 
the form of 1-1 brief intervention and a 1-time, small group session for 
students cited for a substance abuse situation on campus.
 
Finally, please let us know if you are interested in the CADC track courses 
and/or our Area of Concentration.  
 
We are here to be a resource to you and hope you will find SAPP helpful in 
meeting your personal and professional goals.
 
SAPP Staff
