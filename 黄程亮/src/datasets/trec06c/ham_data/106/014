I admit that i usually enjoy the accidental candid writings.  Call me

enlightenment.

We do tend to be careful in public writings, and choose our words so

When I receive the digest, the e-mail of the sender appears  after the
sender's name.  It's quite easy to double-click that e-mail rather than
making a reply.  Does it work the same for others?

Also, I would make a plea to those responding to the entire list to delete
from their replies the errant and lengthy html repetitions of the original
postings and any other extraneous material.  Really, it doesn't take that
long!

It depends on your software.  I use Mozilla and can easily click an email
address and send email to it, but prior versions were extremely clunky to
send private email to a list post.  Even though it was clunky to do, I
didn't mind because I'd much prefer replies to default to the list.  The
majority of the time posters are sending to the list; why make it awkward to
so?

I, too, don't mind a stray private post now and again.  It's not as though
we're flooded with them.  I've been online for more than 20 years and was
taught to never write anything you wouldn't want to see in the newspaper
(heck, some of my early stuff is *still* on the net in archives).  So, if I
am sending something extremely personal, I double- and triple-check the
address.

Me, too. I read the list as a digest, so there's never any danger of sending
a message to the list accidently. But don't all messages that come through
the list get "[ECD]" added to the subject line? Shouldn't that be fair
warning not to hit "reply" unless you want to post to the list?

ECDers --

(1) When I said "reasonable people disagree on this point", that was a
description, not an imperative.  I didn't mean to invite a discussion -
although I appreciate how very civil the discussion has been.

I will not be readily swayed on the settings question.  (That's partly
because I used, for many years, a mail reader that didn't have a
reply-to-all command, and there are still people who use that kind of mail
reader.)


(2) I'm certainly willing to set up a robot to mail out an automatic list
behavor reminder monthly.

This is the best reason I've ever heard for justifying one behavior over

<snip>

> (3) There's English dancing in Las Vegas?  Tell us more!

I've been living in Las Vegas since March 2001.  I have been a member of a
non-profit educational organization that recreates all aspects of life in
any society known to Europe between oh lets say 600 and 1650.  This
organization is about To celebrate its 40th Anniversary (do organizations
have Birthdays?) and I am on their international, Arizona, and Southern
California/Southern Nevada/Hawaii regional organization dance lists.  Right
now much of the discussion I am seeing on those lists pertains to the
dancing at the Grand Ball to be held at the www.estrellawar.org event in
Goodyear (Greater Western Phoenix, AZ) in February over President's day
weekend 2006.  The biggest Grand Ball that I've ever attended .. the SCA
annually holds at www.pennsicwar.org in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania in
August.  I attended in 2004 and had a blast... But that is digression...
Since you asked specifically about ECD in Las Vegas.

EC Dancing in Las Vegas, when I arrived, was limited to when Countess
Ealasaid Nic Churlain travelled up to Las Vegas from Los Angeles and
provided the teaching and the calling.  Some of you may know her as Marsden
Macrae.  I love Marsden's teaching, but we can't get her up here often
enough for the dancers to be happy.  Still she comes out several times a
year, and for that we are grateful.

Roughly three years ago, I asked Marsden about how we might set up an
English Country Dance class regularly here, and I was thinking we could have
it on campus at UNLV, and my new position of President of a recognized
student organization would help us.  Alas, while Marsden did find us a local
who could instruct us, that local instructor was not part of the "university
community" which was narrowly defined as students, staff, and faculty.

Campus insisted that I could book the room for free as a student
organization but after using it some fifty times or more, they could decide
to back bill me $200.00 a night because the instructor was alledgedly seen
to have moved their feet or participated in the dancing -- thus changing
their category from "the source of entertainment" to "non-university
community participant" the latter being their trigger to demand rent.
Nothing really to worry about there because before they'd send me the bill,
they'd block all future attempts to register for classes or procure
transcripts.  Disciplinary action for failure to pay on demand wouldn't
start until at least after two weeks from the mailing date.

I really worked hard to reverse them on their position, citing many reasons
and examples, but the end result was that we had a three-month delay and
eventually found that we could use our on-campus student organization
recognition papers to apply to the public library for access to a room, free
of charge, during library hours, and up to twice a month -- as they provide
to other non-profit organizations -- subject to the stipulation that our
classes be free and open to the public.

Yippee!  Regularly scheduled English Country Dance class began.  Our first
instructor/caller was Chris Kawa.  Later, Chris stepped back and Norma
Biggar took over.  Norma has been supplemented at times by myself, Jim Dana,
and Jeanne Russell.  I have about five dances in my reperitoire, and started
calling literally from the floor when I noticed the people nearest to me in
the dance "Hole in the Wall" were stumbling with the steps, and ever since
then "Hole in the Wall" has been mine to call.

I need to get more organized, and arrange for music to be portable on my own
equipment, and my health issues or my schoolwork keeps getting in the way. I
had surgery over the summer, so hopefully the health problems will all be
gone permanently.  I have not yet created my "calling cards" for calling
dances, nor put the music on my portable mp3 player...or my laptop.

We have been meeting on Monday evenings, from 6:30 to 8:45 (the library
closes at 9).  Mostly we get the second and third Mondays, but this month
due to Labor Day, an organization that holds its business meeting on the
first Monday moved their meeting to the second Monday, so we have only the
third Monday this month.  The room we dance in, the "Jewel Box Theater" is
not carpeted, and has a stack of chairs, two tables and a grand piano in it.
Occasionally we have live music, otherwise we use "the bard in the box".
Attendance ranges from 4-26, usually in direct proportion to the outside
temperature.... Funny not so many dancers come out in the 115+ degrees
Fahrenheit heat...  The branch is known to most locals at the "Flamingo
Library" but it's formal name is the "Clark County Library".  The address is
Clark County Library 1401 E. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, NV 89119.  The cross
street, Escondido st., is one block east of South Maryland Parkway.

I have again begun the process toward re-recognition of the campus student
group: "University Historical Dance Enthusiasts", a process we need to do
each semester in order to keep our ability to book the ECD dates in the
library.

I personally have danced English Country dances once quarterly for two
years, then monthly for two more years, then not at all for nearly two
decades, then picked it up again at UC Berkeley in 2000.  In our dance
classes at the library, we have done English Country Dances considered "in
period" for the sponsoring group, English Country Dances considered "too
modern to be in period" for the sponsoring group, as well as other favorites
like Bransles, Pavannes, Alemandes, and I hope to introduce 15th Century
Italian dance when I feel confident or find an instructor.  I have dance
materiel from England, France, Italy and Germany running from the 15th to
17th centuries.  I personally have also danced English Regency, Contra,
Square and Israeli and International Folk dances.  I have attended classes
for Tribal Dance (about 500 years before modern Cabaret-Style Belly
Dancing), and have drummed for dancers in that style.  Which hook-ups do you
want?

I visited Las Vegas in November of 2000, and was lucky that Marsden visited
then too.  I expect she will be back here in late January or Early February
for the local "Collegium of the Desert" event which is held annually in
Henderson or Las Vegas.

Norma maintains an email list of all sorts of dancing opportunies that I
know has included English Country, Contra, Square, International Folk,
Israeli Folk, and more.. In areas near Las Vegas but inclusive of Southern
California, Arizona and Western Utah.

Does anyone in or near Phoenix, AZ want information about free dance classes
open to the public at ASU Tempe?  I can't promise that ever dance will be
English Country there.  They may do SCA favorites that are not English
Dances...

Anyone anywhere else that wants me to try to find some historical dancing
for them (through contact with one or more historical recreation groups that
I belong to) should email me privately with their city, state or province,
and country and I'll do what I can.  The last disbeliever who challenged me
was astonished that my resources included a group within seven miles of his
home in Perth, Western Austrailia.  Last I heard he had joined up and was
making armor for Knightly combat.

please!

The vast majority of subscribers are smart enough to know that their message

making their first embarrassing 'private' post.

I'm on one e-list where posts go back to the poster rather than the list and
it's a mess.  I finally gave up on it and set my subscription to 'digest

In keeping with the earlier silliness, maybe it's a 'sign' that one is on

Fae Fuerst says -

personal notes spread across a public list...?"

Dear Fae,
The answer to your question depends on the nature of the personal notes.
Certainly it would cause me some embarrassment if my lewd and lascivious
flirtations were frequently disseminated list-wide, but that is a risk I'll
live with. (Of course I can't speak for the embarrassment to the recipient
though they can always lay all the blame on "Crazy Cammy." Aside
- For those of you desirous of such mailings please respond to me off-list).

There is no best solution as mistakes can and will be made in either
situation.

Personally, I don't have difficulty distinguishing and ignoring when an
individual has inadvertently sent a personal note list-wide. I am more at a
loss when I see a list-wide reply to something I never received and can tell
by the response that it is a subject/content that I would like to have been
in on. (Note how deftly I ended that sentence with TWO prepositions). Love
and kisses to the whole list, Cammy

I believe the confusion comes from the fact that many of us receive notes
from list members who are also individual acquaintances so we hit "reply"
without thinking to check whether the original message was public forum or
private communication. Cammy

Re: [ECD] those pesky personal notes






The vast majority of subscribers are smart enough to know that their message
goes out to everyone and the ones that aren't find out pretty soon after
making their first embarrassing 'private' post.

I'm on one e-list where posts go back to the poster rather than the list and
it's a mess.  I finally gave up on it and set my subscription to 'digest
only' and reply to the digest.

In keeping with the earlier silliness, maybe it's a 'sign' that one is on
the 'wrong' path when they post private messages to a public forum. ;>

The other way is also frustrating, I agree. I'm afraid I'll never develop
sufficient paranoia to check the addressee every single time, though --
especially in haste. But maybe 50 more bloopers will do the trick.

I'm on Toronto's mailing list directly, so I got two copies of the
announcement, and neither of them show the ECD list in the headers. Clicking
on one replies to TECD; the other replies to the ECD list. Hazardous!

I was glad we had the most recent go-round on html content, since I ended up
learning how to use the plain text feature to take out the formatting on
pasted-in content in general, very useful.

Thanks,

Fae

Not so.  At this point it's become automatic for most of us that hitting
Reply sends to the recipient only; and Reply All sends to the group.  And it
took Pavlov a while to train those dogs, so one mis-posted reply won't
necessarily modify behavior if the next time is 6 months down the road.

Ah...that's a good point.  I hadn't thought of that...but usually personal
notes I get from other dancers don't have [ECD] in the subject. :)

Huh? 'Reply All' sends to all the recipients the e-mail *knows* of, and
since the only recipient we all *see* is 'ecd-AT-ssrl04.slac.stanford.edu',
that's where the reply goes
-regardless- of whether it's 'Reply' or 'Reply All'.

Unless you've got some unique e-mail software that can do a 'Reply All' to
the bcc list.

Alan,
I often respond to people privately having adopted the tenet that "if I
can't imagine myself or anyone else ever wanting to look up what I had to
say in the archives then it should not go to the list at large." I adopted
this after some reprimands about inappropriate material that caused some
controversy (e.g., my tribute to 2 Morris dancers who perished on 9/11 that
ill-concealed my political bent) and that would never appear in a search I
might perform for ECD-relevant topics.

Having begun the practice of replying of-list when I feel what I have to say
is only of significant importance to the sender, I often find that I later
resubmit a modified version to the list at large upon subsequent discussion
- in other words, the relevance tends to be list-wide even though my initial
judgement was that it should be one-on-one.

This is not a problem (I don't mind resubmitting something) but indicates to
me that your policy of making the default reply be a list-wide distribution
usually "enhances" rather than "burdens" the discussion and only in special
circumstances should we restrict our input to the sending individual.

Of course mistakes will happen but they are rare, easily rectified/ignored,
and if anything they add an element of humor rather than the burden of
inappropriateness.

Finally, it was a great pleasure to finally meet you in person during my
recent trip to SF and I hope to really get to spend time to get to know you
better at some future time when our paths cross. Thanks for the fabulous
service you provide to the ECD community through this list.

Cheers, Cammy

P.S. I began this as a sender only Email that I have pre-emptively sent to
the whole list despite its inappropriate aspects and personal touch, in case
something ends up being relevant!

AAAAZmlr+XrdZk2m1IysrrjKjwEAAAAA-AT-skyhost.net>

Tom (and EC Dancers worldwide on this list):

I think that the discussion has been about whether or not to change the
behavior of the list -- and the changes that would have to be made to how
each of us deals with email from the list -- IF such changes were made.

There are essentially two kinds of lists (and I'm assigning them letters A
and B):

A)  Those that change the headers of messages so that replies go back to the
list
B)  Those that do not change the headers of the list.

This ECD list is currently of type: A.

The action being done to change the headers of messages is called "reply-to
munging" and there are articles online with titles like "reply-to munging
considered harmful" and "reply-to munging considered helpful" which are the
essential arguments in a very heated controversy that has appeared over and
over on the Internet over the years.

Without "reply-to" munging, (such as in a Type B list) if I hit reply on my
email client (and by the way, I use Microsoft Outlook 2003 about 99% of the
time), my reply -- this reply -- would be sent to you alone... As I am
replying to your message in the ECD list.  With the munging, it goes to the
stanford address and is distributed to everyone on the list.

In order to make my reply seen by you and the other members of the ECD list
(if the ECD list were changed to a type B list), I would have to either hit
the reply-to-all button (the easy way) or hit the reply button and add the
address ECD-AT-ssrl04.slac.stanford.edu to the To: or CC: email address fields.
I think we can agree that in comparison to hitting reply-to-all, that adding
that address is the hard way.

But when you look at the headers of the messages you are receiving today,
even if you are just looking at what comes up when you hit reply or
reply-to-all, you are looking at the programmed behavior AFTER MUNGING! This
is because the ECD list is a type A list, a list that changes (munges) the
"reply-to" message header.  That's why the Reply and Reply-to-All seem to be
the same to you, because the normal behavior of the email system has been
changed by the munging of the "reply-to" header to make this pre-programmed
change of behavior happen in your email program.

It's this munging of the "reply-to" header that makes my reply go to
ECD-AT-ssrl04.slac.stanford.edu (the ECD list) and not to you alone at your
personal email address (tomvincent-AT-yahoo.com).  It's true that you read it
at your personal email address (tomvincent-AT-yahoo.com), but that is because
after I send it to ECD-AT-ssrl04.slac.stanford.edu, the computer there that we
know as the "list server" sends it out to you at your email address
(tomvincent-AT-yahoo.com).

Example of the "Reply-To" Header content:

With    Munging: ECD-AT-ssrl04.slac.stanford.edu              (type A list like
this ECD list)
Without Munging: tomvincent-AT-yahoo.com                      (type B list like
some have proposed this ECD list become)

Munging actually removes the individual senders email address from the
headers, which detractors of munging say breaks the functionality of their
email programs.  They have a valid point, as you have observed, because
after munging there is no visible difference between "Reply" and
"Reply-to-all" and without munging, those functions have different results.

Since we are on a Type A list, with "reply-to" munging:  If I wanted to make
this a private reply, I would have to hit "reply" then change the addressing
of the reply message to replace the ECD-AT-ssrl04.slac.stanford.edu address
with your tomrvincent-AT-yahoo.com email address and then you would be the only
one to receive my reply.

Sometimes, people forget that they have to do that when they are on a type-A
list, and get embarrased when a very personal note is sent to a whole
distribution list of people, and they meant for it to be a private message.


Some messages in some lists exist where the participants are quite
passionate about their feelings and beliefs and their ideas conflict....
When this happens between two ore more individuals privately it's called an
argument.  When it happens between two or more individuals and is
disseminated to all the members of a list serve, like everyone on the ECD
list, then it's called a flame war.

Some messages intended to be kept private that go public because of
"reply-to" munging that I have seen have been:  invitations to surprise
parties where the person to be surprised was also on the list, requests for
very personal services ranging from housesitting to sexual acts, love
letters, dating requests, and business transactions not related to the list
topic, etc.

From what I've seen on this list, the concerns are that without reply-to
munging making all messages go to everyone, then people who are interested
in certain discussions may find that there were left out of those
discussions, and the list volume will drop because those that are
communicating are doing it privately and not with the rest of the group.

One question often posed is what is more harmful, letting private messages
go out publically, or having some messages that should have been public go
privately?

I've tried to write this an neutrally as possible.  I used to be a strong
supporter of one of the two ways to run a list server.  Now, because so many
of the lists I am on are behaving the other way, I'm not such a strong
supporter, only because of my fear that I'll be mishandling my messages.  I
do still have an opinion, and my reasons for having that opinion are solid,
but I no longer have the email reflexes I once had, so I'm not as strong in
my support for my opinion of the "right way to do it" (tongue in cheek).  In
fact, I'm ending this missive without stating what side I'm on.  Can you
tell which list behavior I support?

Thank you for the clarification and the word "munging"! Guessing that your
bias is for consistent usability factors and type B list behavior?

I'll put the details of how the program went in a separate post so this
won't get humongous. In general, the dance went very well! We had about
33 dancers, which matches our peak in the brief time I've been keeping
count -- a dozen more than last year's opener, so I'll stop thinking of
September as a low-attendance month.

A lot of your advice was right on. I now see why programmers don't walk
up the primrose path of theme dances very often! A cute idea and a really
well-balanced program are not too compatible, and partially ignoring the
theme for the sake of variety seems like the way to go. That said, this
program's sequences worked fine and people seemed to enjoy the evening a
lot. (Only one dance had no excuse at all under the ever-expanding
guidelines.) The lack of physical variety was not as noticeable as I
feared, but was still a shortcoming. By the time we got to Mendocino
Redwood (third from last) people were creating their own excuses to skip
around.

Worries that the program would be too hard or too stressful were
unfounded, as it turned out. I'm assuming that seeding the directions
among our keen regulars (many of them casual callers themselves) helped,
though I don't really know. Putting the harder dances in the first half
works well for our crowd -- protein first, then dessert. There were a lot
of big smiles in the second half.

We did have some not-advanced dancers who were not put off by (or not
aware of) my subtle warnings -- they survived pretty well but went home
early. I'll be continuing to ponder the dynamics of attracting dancers
ready to do harder dances well, without being too negative. I think the
sweet spot we find ourselves in now came about somewhat inadvertently,
rather than by any direct social engineering that I could see. The huge
variation in this series in the past, and occasional brain-straining
programs, probably get a lot of the credit!

I wonder if the "potluck" aspect of this dance might have actually
contributed to people's enjoyment, though I didn't notice whether people
paid much attention to the theme. Michigan dancers are used to having
several callers in an evening, and it's nice to have a home-grown dance
on occasion, though this whole idea was generated by the squeeze of not
finding an appropriate caller for September. I'm glad it turned out well,
and putting it together was fascinating and fun and educational, but I
would have been happy to skip the work! Once a year is plenty for this
kind of thing.

I'm looking forward to the nice, normal months coming up, with great
callers who do their own programs!

Thanks again for all your help,

    Our group uses several of the dances in the CDM regularly.  There
are several that are quite useful when leading dances for new dancers.
Also   one of the leaders of our group, Jane Hobgood, got her start in
ECD in the 40's and 50's and grew up doing many of those dances so she
likes to lead them frequently at our dances.

MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; format=flowed

Hi All--
   A few observations on the subject of hard dances. . . .  I'm sensing a
subliminal "frisson" attached to the subject.  (Have we all become so timid
as dancers/teachers that we're scared of them?)
   First of all, dances are difficult for a variety of reasons.  They can be
hard simply because they are unfamiliar.  They can have fairly simple tracks
but difficult timing and styling issues.  Or they can have complex,
ever-changing tracks (high piece-count dances like Spring Garden).  Perhaps
the challenges are orientational (St Margaret's Hill, Orliana).  They can be
physically difficult for certain people (slipping rings).  I think if we are
aware of what kind of challenge we are presenting our dancers, there's no
reason to avoid any of them if we choose carefully.
   Virtually any difficulty can be mastered with time and patience.  (I say
this as a trained pianist.  Practice, practice, practice!)  I've
successfully taught St Margaret's Hill to a room of beginners in a community
that dances only once a month.  But I certainly didn't teach it the same way
I would in my regular dance community of know-it-alls.  From this I learned
that sometimes you just have to go slow enough for people to process the
information.  Even a seemingly simple direction ("circle left half way") may
take more or less time to anchor itself in a dancer's brain/body/memory
depending on the context of the dance.  (Punch bowl has this problem--every
time you make that circle, you're in a different place.  Easy enough in a
walk through, disorienting after you've danced a couple of rounds and have
gotten tipsy.)  A dance like Severn Bore seemed very hard the first few
times I learned it.  Now it's a piece of cake--repetition helps.
    Which brings up another point.  Why have we chosen to teach a difficult
dance?  Is it one we'd like to have become a part of our local repertoire?
(Sure glad for all those repetitions of Severn Bore--I love the dance!)  Is
it something we want for a special occasion like a ball?  Something special
for an experienced-dancer workshop?  You have to know your audience and what
they can tolerate--but we can't become so timid about stretching our limits
that we resign ourselves to the same 25 dances in rotation every event.
    That being said, I have nothing against evenings that focus on
easy-to-dance repertoire (provided I don't have to stand around for
extensive teaching of the basics in every dance all evening--unless the
event is billed as "for beginners").  Nor would I want an entire evening in
which all the dances were hard because of a high piece count--even if it
were billed as experienced only.
    There's nothing wrong with "hard."  Hard is not a bad thing.  When I
first started dancing, EVERYTHING we did was hard.  It was a leap of faith
that my partner, my set, my caller would get me through.  And now I've
helped others through in each of those roles.  Challenges make us grow and
keep us fresh.  Go for it!

Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii" ; format="flowed"

Well, well, well.  I've been listening to BBC 3 for about 4 months
now.  All summer long the Proms.  Quite astounding.  Some of it
stunning, some of it innovative - stories and poetry between the
conclusion of one piece and the commencment of the next - but this
evening was the final "Poppsie Poopsie" type event.  Imagine the BSO
with it's cocktail tables set out in Phymphony hall, except this
apparently is both inside and out, multichoral, instruments all over
the place and quite an amazing collection of music including a medley
that claims to have melodies from the different nationalities in the
UK - Danny Boy (oh dear).  Lots of audience hurrahs, orchestrated by
the conductor or someone, lots of audience clapping along amazingly
not that much off the poor band.

You guys might want to check this out next year.  It's laden with the
Englishness that I grew up with and there's something about it that
pertains to the heritage of the dancing we care about here in the US
- a sense of nationality and sentiment and late 19th C Englishness
that called so strongly to Sharp and Gay and Lily Roberts Conant,
Vaughan Williams and Maud Karpeles.

(Now I'm not English, for those who may not know me, but my father
was a pianist who suffered carpal tunnel in the 1930s and wanted more
than anything in the world to play without pain.  And he discovered a
piano pedagogue in London who had the key to his problem.and went
there just before the war and learned how to not hurt any more.  So I
grew up with a bit of English reverence and a bunch of music.)

Speaking of which (I've been waiting for a chance to mention this on the

That'll be the David Blunkett that's been trying to bring in compulsory
standard(ising) identity cards against the will of the majority of the
English people(s).
BTW, having been to many of them, I agree that the Proms are great, apart
from the last night which (like Sharp et al) has very little to do with most
of England, past or present, and, also, like most English institutions, is
viewed by us with a strange mixture of affection and loathing.

This is an interesting discussion.  I'm doing research on the
"Englishness" of ECD in the U.S., to see if it really is all that
significant.  Having discussed dance revivals with colleagues from
Canada, France, Croatia, Norway, and Sweden at a recent conference in
Sheffield, I 'm really not sure that the ethnicity of what we do or what
we call it is that important at all, but rather that we think it's fun
and it fulfills our recreational and social needs.  There isn't really
an English diaspora in the U.S., although there is more of one in Canada
(see Pauline Greenhill's writing on Morris).  I think we do like to
relate what we do to Jane Austen for a certain historic and romantic
frisson, but this doesn't mean a strong ethnic tie to the past but
rather a way to relate to the past.  Then there are the period costumes
and historic re-enactors, which is a whole other topic.

We know that Sharp had several agendas in his revival of English dance,
and he had a direct connection with the revival of English dance in the
U.S.  However, I do think we've moved away from the Sharp tradition and
vision which was certainly continued by May Gadd and Lily Roberts
Conant.  Pat Shaw really helped to "break the barrier" or "push the
envelope" in 1974 when he came to the U.S.  My Canadian colleague Andriy
Nahachewsky researches Ukranian dance in Canada at the University of
Alberta, and there is such a difference in the contexts for dance and
the reasons people take part in it; it is all about ethnic identity in
the diaspora.  When I asked a French colleague why she did Polish dance
(including performances) growing up, she said because it was fun, not
because she is of Polish heritage.  She is actually researching dances
of Yemeni Jews in Israel, within the larger context of the "creation" of
Israeli folk dance.  Some very interesting stuff.

If anyone is interested in discussing this further with me, I am more
than happy to, and can do it onlist or offlist, whatever is best.  I'd
be very intrigued to know what ECD-Listers think of this.

As far as I can tell, in Baltimore there are separate galaxies in the
folk dance universe: heritage dancers and "Others."

The heritage dancers community is just that: they seem to do the dances
of a particular ethnic group.  These dances are part of the continued
expression of a given culture, and the dancing, it seems to me (as an
outsider) are secondary to the cultural expression.

The "Others" seem to me to be communities which put dance first.  People
do ECD, Balkan, Scottish, Scandinavian, contra, or Cajun/Zydeco dances
because they like the Some people develop an interest in the culture that
gave rise to the dances, but others have no knowledge or interest in the
cultural or historical background (which might be just as well; if you
really thought about the Siege of Limerick, we might not want to be
commemorating it with a dance).  I think some people like to play at an
ethnic identity, but that's another issue.

This topic greatly interests me.  If it is not appropriate for this list,
I'd love to pursue it in another cyber venue.

I think that there are very good reasons to be very cautious (though
not "scared" per se) about the inclusion of "hard" dances in an evening
program of dances for a community of dancers, regardless of their
experience (you can find something that is "hard" for any given level).
People come to a dance for enjoyment. True, some get enjoyment from
successfully completing a dance perceived as very difficult. But I
think very few dancers wish to spend 15-20 minutes walking through and
learning a dance that takes 90 seconds to do. In fact, if you ask
contra dancers what they think about ECD, those who have tried it but
didn't like it will cite that problem more often than any other. There
are few things you can do in a program that will turn off beginner
faster than having them spend too much time walking to your talking,
and too little time dancing.

But some difficulties are worth the trouble, some aren't. Although I
suspect I'll get disagreement from those on this list, for the average
ECD dancer, "difficulty" is a negative, and "practice" (let alone
"practice, practice, practice") is not what they came to the dance to
do - they came to dance. The "better" a dance is, the more it's worth
the work you need to put into it. This is, of course, extremely
subjective, but I think that as most classical music buffs would agree
that Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is "better" than his First, I suspect
most ECD'ers would agree that Newcastle is (somehow) "better" than Fair
Quaker of Deal, so some discussion along these lines is possible. So,
to me, it's worth the effort to learn The Friendly Brooke, for example,
with it's different, unforgiving, and complicated figures - because the
reward is so great. But it's not worth what is probably a similar
effort to learn Cupid's Garden. And neither works well for an evening
dance unless you have virtually all extremely experience dancers - both
are the stuff of workshops and Balls.

But "hard" is not a good thing either. If the challenge yields
sufficient reward, then go for it. But picking dances for a program for
their difficulty makes little sense to me. Given equal rewards, equally
"good" dances, give me the easier one.

I declare it appropriate, if that makes any difference.

A brilliant assessment, meaning that I agree with all of it.  May I
use it on my website?

It seems to be another difference between dancing in the States and
in England.  Here we don't have the core repertoire that you have in
the States (I'm not saying that's a good thing, just that it's a
fact) and I would say that most evenings consist of a high proportion
of dances unknown to most of the dancers.  It doesn't seem to be a
problem.  Of course an unknown dance is not necessarily a hard dance.

Well, that's not my opinion.  I think Cupid's Garden (from Maggot
Pie) is a wonderful dance and I've called it many times with great
success. It seems dancers in England are much more willing to do a
long walkthrough, and a Playford-style dance with three totally
different figures is perfectly acceptable.

Renata and I were at Pinewoods several years ago and were bored with
some of the evening dances where we were given the same stuff over
and over again.  But it seems to be what most Americans want.  Brad
Foster discussed it with me, saying that in the evenings people
wanted simple familiar dances, not what I was giving them (and I have
a great respect for Brad).  I asked a few good dancers including Mary
Kay Friday, and they all agreed.

Renata says that if she's tired by the evening and is given simple
dances she switches off and becomes even more tired, whereas the
occasional challenge will wake her up.  I'm certainly not saying that
an evening dance should be a workshop,  but I think you've swung too
far the other way in the States.

Let me point out that I _am_ capable of calling a whole evening of
simple dances - I've called hundreds of barn dances, and for nine
years I helped run the =93Beginners=94 sessions at Cecil Sharp House in
London every Thursday.  I even call children's dances, and would love
to be booked by CDSS for Family Week!

Here are the details of how the program went (in my opinion, of course)
for those interested. I'll also add that, like the June dance, this dance
ran miraculously exactly on schedule -- and it was also too hot in the
hall again!

Our band was the extra-special combination of Earl Gaddis of Bare
Necessities and Anne Ogren and Debbie Jackson of Childgrove, so it was no
surprise that people enjoyed the music a lot. (We were thrilled to hear
that Earl is moving to the Kalamazoo area!) I wish we'd heard more music
earlier in the teaching; there were too many music-less walkthroughs,
though this got better as the evening progressed. I forgot to ask the
band to play the tunes as each caller was coming up (or something) and
our callers didn't always think of it either.

Ray Bantle, Ruth Scodel, Shirley Harden, and Dan Blim (who just moved
here from Philadelphia) taught dances that they and others (including
some of you) had requested or suggested. The idea was that these were our
fellow dancers sharing what they'd learned at camp. Overall, they did a
pretty nice job and were well received, with the inevitable rough moments
and better patches that you'd expect at a "potluck."

This was the program as danced:

Heather Towers -- Ray (to the tune of Moon and Seven Stars)
Trip to San Jose -- Ruth
Vivaldi in Paradise -- Shirley
Key to the Cellar -- Dan
Perpetual Motion -- Ruth
Renewed Friendship -- Shirley
Alice -- Ruth
-- break --
Mr. Legge's Initiation -- Ray
Treasure of the Big Woods -- Ray
Mendocino Redwood -- Shirley
Wibsey Roundabout -- Dan
Sunlight Through Draperies -- Dan

Heather Towers worked well as a starter -- with the alternate jig it was,
as I expected, a nice undemanding beginning for this crowd, while not
being easy enough to give anyone a false sense of security. I was sorry
we didn't manage to get the original tune played as well -- I was curious
about that. Trip to San Jose went okay as well, though I'm still
wondering if it was really the dance I was trying to remember from
Buffalo Gap, and if not, what on earth that dance was. There was a nice
energy spike when we heard the music for Vivaldi in Paradise; you could
see people think "whoo! That's what we're here for!" The hey and gypsy
required the dancers to gear up a bit in their concentration, and I was
pleased with this as a third dance. I guess it wasn't fair to expect Key
to the Cellar to thrill me as much as it did at dance camp, but it was
very nice...Perpetual Motion was hard to get rolling and suffered from
too many cooks trying to teach it from the floor -- it had generated a
lot of theories and rules before we even started. I was glad we did it
and will try to get back to it sometime. Thank you for saving me from
putting it too early! This spot was just right.

At the last minute I switched Renewed Friendship to the "if-time" sixth
slot instead of Mendocino Redwood, thus being sure to avoid having the
only two set dances AND mixers right next to each other if we ran early
or late. It was fun here. That meant we didn't really need Alice as a
relief dance, and it wasn't quite the peak I expected -- but I expected a
lot from it, and others may disagree. It was certainly nice.

We ended the break on time, somewhat reluctantly, and as soon as I heard
the beginning notes of Mr. Legge's Initiation I knew the second half was
going to fly and got a big grin on my face. People settled into their
stride and really enjoyed this dance. Then Treasure of the Big Woods --
ba-boom -- went very well, once people got the timing of the gypsies and
setting in lines. These are both Joseph Pimentel dances to Dave Wiesler
tunes, and it was excellent to have them together. (I'm so happy that
Dave Wiesler is in our world!) Mendocino Redwood is a nice easy dance
with that brand-spanking-new cachet, and I think this may have been the
first dance we managed to just roll right into. At this point the lack of
any run-around dances in the program started to make itself felt, as
people started skipping in the stars, and then in the half-figure
eights...

We scraped up exactly three sets for Wibsey Roundabout -- lucky again.
This is a familiar, reliably fun dance in Michigan and didn't disappoint.
As we moved into Sunlight Through Draperies ahead of schedule I was
wondering, "do we throw in Yellow Stockings?" but we ran STD long instead
and this seemed like the right choice. A few people had reservations
about how much they would enjoy this dance, but on the night it was a
sweet, smooth cooldown to end the evening, and the band hit a beautiful
groove -- not for the first time, of course.

Several people told me that this was the best evening of English country
dancing they'd had for a long time. Others presumably didn't have such a
good time, but there were general kudos. I get so adrenalized at these
things, though, that I can't really tell how good they are. One of the
many reasons I won't be doing this regularly!

See my other post for the rest of the "report."

Many thanks to all who helped with this,

Sorry Colin, I didn't mean to imply that I don't like the dance or that
it can't be done efficiently. I just find that spending the amount of
time it has taken just to get through Cupid's Garden where I have
danced it (Pinewoods, Baltimore), much less actually dance it to a
satisfactory degree, has seemed inordinate for the level of reward, by
comparison to Friendly Brooke. Certainly the experience level of the
dancers affects this, as well as the ability of the teacher. Having see
you (Colin) teach Step Stately in about 5 minutes, I can believe your
success with Cupid's Garden.

We've done Mendocino Redwood several times in the Bay Area at
different dance series. Bob Fraley, one of the authors, calls it.  I
always skip for the 1/2 figure eights and hope that others pick it
up, which they usually do.  The original intention was to skip them
(not the stars, IIRC) since the dance is so high energy.  I remember
a distinct thrill when we first showed that dance to the assembled
camp at Mendocino show and tell, the 2's bursting up in that 2nd
phrase.  We seem to have lost Sharp's running step in most dances,
but this one seems to require it for the doubles and crosses.

So, is this the best dance ever written by a committee??

Don't know as never seen or heard of Mendocino Redwood  before.

But have a look at "Stake through the Heart" from the "Dracula
Collection" written in the Write a Dance for Whitby workshops at the
Whitby Folk Festival back in1988.  That's not a bad dance, and written
by at least 13 people at the workshops.  As a bit of added impetus, I
also understand the dances (6 that year) had to be written and also
published in a booklet before the end of the week festival.

Dear Friends,

  Help us to start our season with a bang! We're opening the
Wednesday dance series  this Wednesday Sept 14, with a party,
featuring all of our leaders, and the music of Bare Necessities. The
dance begins at 7:30PM at the Park Avenue Community Church in
Arlington Ma, just off Route 2 and an easy bus ride from Harvard Square.

After all the buzz about dances we learned this summer, I'm curious
to see what our leaders have produced.

For more details about the dance, how to get there and special events
for this season, please consult our web site: http://www.cds-

Best,
  Terry

Lots of people do around where I live, that being the California wine
country.  There's a whole community of Germans who moved to the Sonoma area
in the 30's or thereabouts to work in the wineries, and they're polka
fiends.  You can see them at a restaurant called Little Switzerland in El
Verano any Friday or Saturday night; the tradition of polka nights there
has gone on for something like 40 years.

There's a San Francisco band called Polkacide who have gotten locally
infamous for doing more or less straightforward polka music, but dressed in
outrageous punk outfits, very loud, and usually in alternative-music clubs.
  We went to see them at a bar in Cotati, which is a college town, the home
of Sonoma State University.  The crowd was mostly college kids, who were
pogoing and crashing and leaping around and generally dancing the way you'd
dance to a punk-rock band, but there was also an older couple, probably in
their 60's, who were happily and quite obliviously polkaing away, complete
with lots of snazzy turns and dips and hot moves.  The college crowd
respectfully gave them lots of floor space.  The combination of the two
styles was lots of fun to watch.

coming in late on this because i am in New Orleans where time and
connectivity are in short supply, but talking about polka is an
irresistible distraction.

in the past two years i've become a part-time resident of Minneapolis.
i thought the biggest difference from my southern home in Atlanta would
be that everyone would be freakishly tall and blonde. while that turned
out to be true, the even bigger difference is that everyone who is tall
and blonde knows how to polka and does it enthusiastically and
unironically. (they even know all the lyrics. i had no idea polkas
*had* lyrics.)

there's a restaurant/bar not far from UMinn called Nye's, home of the
World's Most Dangerous Polka Band (TM) (who are not alternative, but
rather frighteningly trad)  that is a full-on hang-out for tall skinny
cool people much younger than me. they *all* polka - some in the
mosh-pit ways Jon described, others more formally. and they all also
give way to the more traditionally minded 50-70-year-olds who have less
wild energy but much more style. in the ECD/contra community, we're
accustomed to seeing several generations on the same dance floor - but
i'm not at all accustomed to seeing it in a bar or club. it's a trip.

(i assume they can also all hambo. just the idea of mosh-pit hambo
makes my head hurt.)

I have always worked on the premise that what makes a dance "hard" or
"challenging" is mostly the skill (or lack thereof) with which it is
taught. There are numerous variables that contribute to how easily person
X assimilates the concepts versus person Y, but foremost among them is the
quality of the instruction and that quality must be a dynamic rather than
a specific skill set because each person and each crowd has different
learning styles etc... so what works one night with one group may not work
at all the next night at a different dance.
This philosophy emminated from the observation that when I started
calling, I considered dances such as Newcastle more "difficult" than other
dances but as I gained experience I gained the ability to coax even rank
newcomers through the dance in a way that was enjoyable to all. The
figures didn't change, the music was pretty consistent, and the ability of
the newcomers to learn more intricate choreography didn't change. What
changed was my ability to assess the crowd, choose the instructions that
might work well for them, and my ability to convey my intent to an ever
shifting audience that required constant and real-time adjustments in
approach.

If you're dancing for *fun*, then the axis of hard-easy doesn't really
have much significance other than to separate those who focus extra
energy and brain-cells on complex dances from those who don't.

That being said, complex dances can certainly be stimulating and they
may be fun to some and frustrating to others.

A tough dance can become easier to learn in the hands of a skilled
instructor just as an easy dance can become difficult in the hands of a
clumsy instructor.

As instructors, we need to know our personal limits and, if desired,
work on expanding them.

As dancers, we need to let the instructor(s) know when we'd like to try
more complex dances and understand the challenge they pose to dancers
and instructors alike.

I grew up (Ha Ha Ha) in Amherst, MA USA. When we moved there in 1959, many
of the road signs were in polish or bilingual because a large proportion
of the population in Amherst and the vast majority of residents in
surrounding towns (e.g., Hadley) were first generation Pols. Most of my
classmates were 2nd generation and (besides learning every politically
incorrect ethnic joke about Polish people from them!) they often invited
our family to go to their Sat. night shindigs where they danced polka
after polka all night long (with a few other dances that I didn't grasp
thrown in). They still do these and there are radio programs that play
nothing but polish music and some are in the language to this day.

Then came the Swedish connection that brought other polkas in the
Scandinavian repertoire to the contra/ECD dancers of the Pioneer Valley of
Massachusetts in the 1970-1990s. This led to some humorous situations like
when I found myself teaching the Swedish version of the Norwegian Polka to
New Englanders (whose own version bears only slight resemblance).

Periodically, influxes of international folkdancers into the contra crowds
brought an appetite for some unfamiliar dances and styles that are neither
indigenous to New England nor representative of a particular place of
origin.

I get your point - that most Americans do not do these dances the way they
"should" be done (i.e., as they are danced in their native contexts), but
then again we are not in their native context and at least we occasionally
get instruction on how they SHOULD be done even if we find it hard to
adopt all the nuances (especially when the music is also often
Americanized).

I learned the Norwegian Polka, the Schottische, the Gay Gordons, the Road
to the Isles, the Hambo, the Salty Dog rag, and a few others when I first
started contradancing. I learned them not as dances from different
locations around the world that ought to be done with as much of those
geographic nuances as we could muster, but as dances that had been adopted
into the traditional New England repertoire to be done in the style that
New Englanders found satisfying and workable with their music and dancing
skills during a typical evening of Contradancing. Such an approach is not
"wrong" but "different" from the one where you try to mimic the dances as
done by the people in their places of origin. Probably the only thing
wrong is that we have failed to change the names of the dances as they
were adopted (e.g., New England Polka rather than Norwegian).
I learned various polskor, polkas, mazurkas, waltzes etc... during my
visits to Sweden where I learned not only how they were done in the places
I stayed, but also how differently they are done as one moved from
community to community in Scandinavia.

The contrast in these approaches is analogous to the contrast in
approaches that generates much of the discussion on this list about
whether dances published 350 years ago should be danced as we like to
dance today or as we think they were done back then and of course the
related discussions about how much we don't and how little we do know
about how any of the dances were done at the time and place in history
when they were popular.

The interesting part is how many of us grew up in another USA - one
in which the cultural heritage was largely european, and largely
northern european to boot.

Not my point, actually at all.

Rather, I would have promoted a better focussed conversation on this
subject had I been a bit more specific - to amend my original quote
above let me say "How many recreational dancers in the US who find
their way to ECD have any idea how to polka" in any style?

Most of our prospective growth audience hardly knows how to take
ballroom position, much less how to dance any thing (polka, waltz,
even just a 50's rock'n'roll slow dance) in that hold.

Reaching this massive group of 12-50 year olds is one of our eternal
projects and speaking a language they understand to convey how to do
what we so love to do has to climb over a chasm of definition of
"dance" which seems to me to be quite enormous.  Just the idea of
dancing to "music" with a melody is fast becoming completely foreign
to a huge portion of the population of the US.  Even the concept of
"melody" is absent from their sound world.

Moving from "music" to "melody" to "polka" is a long journey, to me.

Oddly, you missed the largest polka-dancing ethnic group:  Mexicans.

That's really an absurd series of incorrect statements.  Of course
modern music has melody and going to any dance club will quickly prove
that people in their teens, twenties and thirties are more than capable
of identifying it and even do an evolved form of the 'ballroom
position' when slow dances come around:  Face-to-face and both arms
around the neck.

Last year at Early Music camp I saw a group of teens doing what I can
only describe as 'Extreme Sword-Dancing' and it was thrilling to see
them revise an ancient form of dance into something they could enjoy
and  relate to.

If someone is into dance, they often enjoy a wide-variety of dance
styles, but if you're complaining to people that their music doesn't
have melody it's no surprise that you're having problems recruiting new
dancers.

Regardless of what we do, teens and twentysomethings basically don't
want to do something when they walk into a room and see a bunch of
grey-hairs doing it.

Human nature (at least in the US).

The only way around that is to find a few teens and twentysomethings
that *do* enjoy it, teach them to call and help them (from the shadows)
set up dances for their own age group.

Otherwise, a number of dance styles will die out and will only be
revived occasionally in the future as a novelty (such as swing dancing
was a few years ago).

Not so among the young people I know. Yes, they listen to a lot of music
which is really poetry-over-rhythm rather than melodic, but they also listen
to multiple other styles of music.

And around here, at least, there was a huge revival of swing-dancing a
couple of years ago, almost entirely among people under 25. Like all fads,
it has passed, but the kids who were doing that are now doing lots of salsa
dancing, so they're still dancing to melodies.

I wouldn't despair just yet.

Paul

We're perilously close to "these kids today ... the music they listen to,
it's just noise!"  (And given that there's a genre called "noisecore", it's
easy to think that's the case.)

I think Tom Vincent is right (and how often do I say that?); the difficulty
isn't that people are growing up not listening to melodies.  There's melody
all over the radio; there's melody in church; there's melody in
kindergarten; there's melody in movies.  There's melody in hip-hop music
(although it tends to appear briefly, in the samples).

Further, liking thud-and-clump music doesn't preclude liking English country
dance.  (I run a Regency dance [actually modern ECD interpretations of dances
from, more-or-less, Jane Austen's lifetime] at a local science fiction
convention; one of the people who's most into it is a guy who tells me that he
can't come to our second-Friday dance parties because he goes to a techno dance
that night.)

I think the big problems with recruiting under-50s are:

 1) This stuff isn't for everybody.  (I think most, but not all, physically
    able and mentally capable English-speakers could live through an evening
    of ECD, but consider how many contradancers - people who can do and enjoy
    a closely-related form - really dislike ECD.  What percentage of
    the general population are capable of enjoying it?)

 2) Critical mass.  While multigenerational activities can be popular, being
    the only representative of your generation at an activity can be
    uncomfortable.  (Among other things, young single people usually like to
    have some date prospects around when they go out.)

 3) Generational dropout.  Around here at least, it seems like only people
    who were already dedicated dancers keep coming dancing after they have
    kids, and new dancers don't generally start then if they _do_ have kids.
    (If you're going to pay for a babysitter, you're likelier to have a
    guaranteed nice night out doing something you know you like than to try
    something weird.)  We get a big hole in the 30-40 (ish) age range.

 4) Lack of immediate accessibility and lots of competition for recreational
    time.  Few people are actually good at this stuff the moment they walk
    in the door for the first time.  It has to _really_ speak to you to make
    you keep coming back often enough and long enough to acquire fluency and
    be rewarding in itself.

 5) Extremely un-hip locations.  (Church social halls with the flourescent
    lights turned on full.  Halls that are essentially suburban, even
    if they're within city limits; often hard to get to by transit and not
    part of a district that has a "scene".)  Stick your nose in and is there
    anything exciting going on?  There's either a bunch of people standing and
    listening or they're in the middle of doing something that looks hard and
    that you can't join in on until this one ends and the next one starts
    (although that's sometimes ameliorated if someone was sitting out and can
    join in).

 6) Complicated story.   (I spent Saturday co-sitting a table at the
    "Independent Arts and Media Expo" in San Francisco, putting forth
    English / Contra / Regency / English Ceilidh / longsword / morris
    as participatory arts  activities to a crowd of 20s - 50s people who,
    demonstrably, leave the  house on occasion.

    It was handy to be repping multiple dances, because  ome people were "you
    don't have to wear costumes, do you?" and some were "do you get to wear
    costumes?" and I could route them each in the right direction.

    But answering the "what kind of dance is this" question,
    which I think I got down to about 50 words, is hard.  (The points I was
    hitting were: come by yourself or with a friend, you don't have to take
    classes beforehand, the basic unit is the couple; you and your partner of
    the moment spend a couple of minutes learning a particular choreography,
    then execute that with another couple and another couple and another
    couple, then change partners, learn another choreography and repeat.
    Acoustic music from the British Isles and America.  No commitment; check it
    out, if you like it, come back when you're free; no series of classes.)

    We probably talked to fifty people - there were 120 arts associations
    represented, and our table was between an arts-oriented cable access
    channel and a Filipino-American theatre company, to give you some idea of
    the breadth here - and we moved quite a few flyers and got some interest;
    there were other people we clearly lost.  There was one who glazed over
    at the word "traditional"; a couple I lost at "choreography."

    Even people who were quite engaged and had done other participatory dance
    - Zydeco, for example - had trouble with the idea that you keep learning
    new stuff throughout the evening, rather than having a clearly-demarcated
    lesson time and party time.  "Is it a lesson or is it a dance?"


I think those are the major points; I don't think they have much to do with
not knowing how to take a ballroom hold.  (Once people have the idea of taking
dance instruction, you can teach 'em to galop instantly, and polka's not _that_
much harder.)

Alan listed accurately if rather depressingly all the reasons that it's hard
to recruit younger EC dancers. These are all good things to keep in mind,
but I wouldn't want people to read his good post and give up hope. This
stuff ISN'T for everybody, but it IS big fun. In Ann Arbor, where we've had
close to zero involvement by University of Michigan students for years,
we've suddenly got a group of grad students that are energized to market
dancing to students, and we're seeing results at our dances. At an info
table last week where we were one of at least 400 organizations
exhibiting--everything from breakdancing to engineering fraternities--we
talked to quite a few students who got why contra dancing would be fun. The
kids who were interested were only a small fraction of the number passing
by, but if a fourth of them showed up at a dance, that would be a stunning
increase in our under-40 dance population. OK, that's contra, but we're
starting some new ECD things with students, too, so in a couple of months
we'll know how they're working and report back. We also held a dynamite ECD
family dance this summer that was as much fun as I've ever had dancing, so
we're going to figure out how to repeat that.

I've seen a good sampling of not-for-everybody late-teens / early-twenties
dancers in Massachusetts, and West Michigan does great with this, too. I
think the list hasn't talked about this in a while: I'd be interested to
hear what specific activities others have done that have been successful in
bringing in younger people. And what do you do to mitigate the issues that
Alan points out?

In re recruitment of teens-early 20s dancers, I had the fortune to grow up
in a college town where I learned some of the tricks that work. Here is a
list of some of the activities I did to get students to become involved:

1) Played music during lunchtime at the health-food cafeteria on
University campus (with stack of fliers. They even gave me free lunch for
playing!)
2) Played street music in town at various locations as close to where
people would be waiting for the bus back to campus as I could,
3) Solicited invitations to lead dancing at social get-togethers of the
Outing Club, the off-campus commuters org, dorm parties,
get-to-know-each-other beginning of the school year parties and freshman
events,
4) Contacted faculty in the history department to offer my services for
educating students in social life of particular eras,
5) Contacted the Scandinavian studies faculty for playing Swedish music
6) Stayed in touch with the recreation department that offered a class in
international folkdance to make sure that they informed interested
students about area dances in ECD and contra (and was often invited to
lead one of their classes),
7) Taught dancing and fiddling through the Continuing Education programs
at the University
8) Included campus stands on local Morris tours and postered bulletin
boards with notices about May Day activities etc...
9) Talked about it and got other eager dancers to talk about it at every
opportunity - I think word of mouth is THE MOST effective method
10) Encouraged or arranged for potlucks where whole groups of novices (who
were timid to show up alone) could go to the dance together. If the band
and caller participated, it further piqued their curiosity and (when the
band gets up to leave, it creates a signal for everyone to think about
getting over to the dance versus letting the potluck continue as its own
social event so late in the evening nobody wants to dance...)
11) Got as many gigs as I could, at weddings, anniversaries, parties,
etc... where few of the attendees had ever encountered social dance of
this type. It helped to get to know local caterers, florists, etc... who
could recommend Contra or ECD to people who asked about entertainment
options.
12) Always emphasized the community aspect of social dance and how it is
community-building and non-judgemental in terms of frequency of
participation, skill of execution, or financial donations.

This is just a brief list of the kinds of things I did to attract
interest. I can't say it was greatly successful, but I can say that after
a few years of this kind of effort a large proportion of both residents
and students in Amherst had heard of or seen ECD, Contra, Morris, etc...
even if they hadn't actually participated. For groups like the Outing
Club, contra sort of became their in-club activity at all events so nearly
everyone knew the basics, but this did not necessarily translate into
attendance at regular local dances. My most effective recruitment period
is when I was also a student participating; like when I signed up for the
International Folkdancing class in the Rec department. That semester they
made attendance at one of my local contradances a mandatory homework
assignment. As I became consumed with middle age and family
responsibilities, I let many of my efforts at recruitment lapse which was
OK as long as the dances were a stable weekly occurrence (word of mouth
still functioning as a robust recruitment device). However, any change
(e.g., day of the week or location) met with a dramatic decline in numbers
and not much recovery in the absence of the comprehensive recruitment
effort I had used in years past.

Although it is hard to translate awareness into regular attendance, the
first step is always to make sure people in general know of the existence
and even better, have some idea of what it's like. Getting people to
actually "love to dance" is a more elusive goal, but I think we all agree
that to do so one must get them onto the dance floor at least a couple
times. Different people will catch the bug after different amounts of
exposure and some will never really take to it, but if the dance has a
"community feel" I believe it is more likely to generate that enthusiasm
than if it has an "elitist feel." We compromise something (e.g., quality
of dancing, quality of sound, sophistication of repertoire) in order to
maintain that "community feeling" but that feeling is what keeps us robust
and current with the general needs and desires of the local communities.
And - as the readers on this list know - I personally think that there
needs to be less compromising of those aspects in the effort to maintain a
community feeling than most people would assume.

I think there is a conception that attendance is falling off in recent
years at dances in New England because the craze in social dance of these
types (that blossomed around the time of the US bicentennial) has run its
course. But as I look back at the history of HOW we got people to join the
dancing community, it seems to me more likely that this is the reason
behind the decline.
Of course countless other variables (hall rental costs, insurance
requirements, musician pay expectations, the existence of less-open dances
like "challenging contras" etc...) have burdened the scene. But there was
very little dancing in my part of the world until I began a tireless
campaign to bring it to all ages and all people. In those days I
hitch-hiked around and played fiddle tunes in the car to everyone who
picked me up. In fact, I often hitch-hiked IN ORDER to play fiddle tunes
to those who picked me up. I played on the street in Amherst (for nearly
no donations because students are generally poor) and I taught dancing in
nursery schools and senior centers and nursing homes to people who could
hardly move or were in wheel chairs. It didn't matter that none of these
were going to be coming to my local dances, but if they told their
families what fun they had trying to get through a dance and listening to
the folk music, those families might recognize my name or the word
contradance on a flier and think - "we ought to try that out."

Of course, this worked fine for as long as I was living in a tent on next
to no income. Much of it had to fall by the wayside once I had a family
and needed a regular job with health benefits etc...
So I think the person who suggested that we not only need to coax teens to
the dances but also to make them into recruiters themselves, was right on
the money. They interact well with their peers and often can spare more
time and energy to infiltrate the community and spread not only the word,
but also the enthusiasm!

One caution is that some people are naturally great at spiking interest
and conveying enthusiasm while others seem to cause more harm than good.
There are some people whom I wish were not on the front lines recruiting
new faces. I'm not sure how you can judge which is which or try to control
that. Probably there are plenty that say this about me and my efforts.
Cheers, Cammy

One of my wife's co-workers went to a contra dance a couple of years ago;
I'm damned if I remember why, but he did.  This is someone with no prior
exposure to folk dance whatsoever.  I thought his reaction was interesting:
"I went there to DANCE, not to have some guy up at the front of the room
telling me what to do."  Clearly, his definition of "dance" didn't include
the whole concept of callers, and after he said that it occurred to me that
that's probably pretty common.

Cammy, are you saying that you think the main reason for declining
attendance is that we often haven't been working effectively at bringing
in young people? And essentially, that good grass-roots publicity can
make country dancing popular anytime? Hope you're right.

It's probably a brain thing, eh? Some people want to dance with a lot of
improvisation -- usually ALL improvisation -- not with a fixed structure.
I can't improvise my way out of a paper bag, so I'm grateful that someone
tells me what to do, but I've often seen people react the way you
describe. It's one of the basic barriers to getting people into country
dancing.

    A member of the U of I history department and his wife attend our
local contra and English dances.  When he teaches the U.S. history
survey class (he does this about every other year) he has us come in and
demonstrate a couple of early American dances.  We then get some of the
students to join us for a couple of simple dances.  We did this last
week and had over 30 kids dancing.  We let them know about our local
dances and handed out fliers.  Hopefully a few of them will come and
give it a try.

    I was thinking about other departments on campus that might be
places to recruit new dancers.  I usually put fliers up in the music and
dance departments.  However it occurred to me that one place to
potentially recruit new English dancers is the English department.  I
did a search for U of I faculty who have presented papers at JASNA (the
Jane Austen Society of North America) and came up with the name of a
professor.  I wrote to her and invited her to our dances and also
suggested that we could potentially teach period dances to students in a
class studying Jane Austens books, or any other similar author.  She is
on sabatical this semester, but gave me the name of several other
professors who teach similar courses.  I've contacted them and asked
them to pass the word on to their students.  So far I've only heard from
one student who is interested, but that encourages me to think that it
may pay off in the long run.

Just what sort of dancing did he think he was going to do when the
music started?

I don't think that's a common attitude or definition at all.  If
anything, it's ...uh...'unique'.

People who have never done any country line dancing, swing dancing or
ballroom dancing would never come to one of those dances expecting to
just 'dance' without instruction.

Great stuff, Campbell.  I've been trying to get a UofD student or two
to learn to call so they can arrange & call their own dances.

One thing I'll add:  Some people are great are initiating activities
and some people are great at running activities and some people are
great at continuing activities.  These are often three different groups
of people and it's important for members of them to recognize
themselves and turn over control to the proper group when the dance has
evolved to the next state.

I'm afraid that, post-1965, a very great number of people expect exactly this. That is, to them,
"dance" means: hop up and down, flail your arms, and roll your head. Under a glitter ball, these
movements make you look exactly like John Travolta in *Saturday Night Fever*. Really. It never
fails.

Oh.  So those sock-hops in the '50s, USO dances during WW2 and the
dances done by flappers at speak-easies in the '20s were carefully
choreographed group efforts.

What crap!  Do you have any idea of how much work Travolta went through
to learn all the intricate moves he performed in SNF?  How about
Jennifer Beals in 'Flashdance'?  The kids in 'Fame'?  Jennifer Gray and
Patrick Swayze in 'Dirty Dancing'?  'Drumline'?  'You Got Served'?
Nearly every music video made in the past 20 years?

Regardless of the venue or style, people that show talent on the
dancefloor earn the respect of their peers.  Those who look like
klutzes are laughed at.  Just like it's been for 400+ years.

No, but if anyone wants to have a go at it without the utter tedium of
trying to watch the film second-by-second to reconstruct the
choreographies, I have a book of disco dances from 1978 that describes
a "Night Fever" line dance.  I haven't checked to see if it's exactly
the same as in the film but it does have that characteristic move with
the arm pointed up.

It is all too easy to slip into being contemptuous about music and dance we
don't like, but it won't help us recruit people.  Every year I teach a
class on Playford to high school students on a special visiting day at the
University of Michigan.  We discuss the preface and do a couple of dances.
In this setting, it actually helps that it is very hard for them:  it keeps
them from concentrating on its possible dorkiness.  It also helps that the
music is on cd, because there is no excuse to go slowly, and choose brisk
dances.  When they get through Sellenger's, they are very pleased with
themselves.  I don't know if any of these kids will ever do ecd again, but
I remember one of them who said as he left, "Man, those people in the 17th
century could really move!"

I don't think it's easy at all:  I believe you have to actively *work*
at hatred and bigotry, regardless of whether it's toward other people
or other music.

I'm glad you mention Sellenger's Round:  I've used it as an
introductory dance many times (at schools and even at Unitarian
Solstice celebrations) and it always ends with everyone happy,
chattering away with a smile of their faces.  Hard to think of a better
gift to give people at their first ECD experience.

Whoa, hold up.
I never for a moment suggested that Travolta or Gray or anyone else was not dancing with
consummate skill; or for that matter that the Charleston or swing or anything else were formless
OR easy. Please do not attribute to me contempt for anyone else's dance style or tradition. I was
for one dumbstruck with admiration for Travolta the last time I saw *SNF* (and yes, Susan, I
fast-forwarded through the "plot" to get to the dance). I hope my remark suggested that there is
some DISTANCE between the "leave-me-alone-and-let-me-move-freely" dancer and Travolta's genuine
skill.
What puzzles me--and the point of my jest, and yes, it *was* a jest--is how or where some get the
notion that if they simply jump up and down that they are a) dancing and b) dancing really well.
Perhaps some have always felt, no matter the form, that dance is really easy and requires neither
practice nor observation nor training, with predictable results. I'm just grateful that this
personality type doesn't usually seem to be drawn to, say, bridge construction or eye surgery
(*also* a jest; I have the greatest respect for surgeons, engineers, bridges, and eyes).

Well, yes and no.  Your general point is probably correct: Once popular music
moved away from the formal couple dance form - once the 30-year reign of the
foxtrot was over - and kids stopped automatically getting dance lessons in
school, social dance became "unstructured" and "improvisatory".  (Scare
quotes around those words because of my feeling in a lot of cases that things
that are formally unstructured and improvisatory have structure and rules that
may or may not have been articulated but which you can get in trouble for
breaking.)

If the idea is just that you get out on the floor and do _something_, with the
lights on and everybody watching, then you only dance if you're not worried
about looking like an idiot.  That tends to weed out the shy and contribute to
dance not being something everybody does, even though there's no longer any
formal barrier to entry like taking dance lessons.  (I think the active as
distinct from reconstructed social dance movement forked in the 1970s, into
disco ("touch dancing", with songs with melodies and formal structures,
specific dance styles ("Hustle"), and people woodshedding choreographies at
home and coming back to show them off) on the one hand, and various kinds of
free form unpartnered wackiness ("noodle dance" at Dead concerts, thrashing and
moshing at metal and punk shows, dancing that worked with sudden improvised
guitar and drum solos that wandered away from obvious structure) on the other
hand.  The very weird period of the 60s where you were supposed to dress up and
ask a partner to dance and then "improvise" some non-touch dancing (which
improvisation might consist of choosing from an internal menu of often-mimetic
 moves - the Mashed Potato, the Swim, the Pony, etc, has not continued.)

[Somewhere around here I have a Swinging-London era booklet of "Discotheque
Dances", blessed by the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dance, illustrated with
photos of well-dressed people obviously wearing cologne and hairspray doing,
eg, the Monkey, and with the moves described in extremely stuffy language.
They're not actually saying "glissade", but the cognitive dissonance induced by
this booklet makes it worth a look.]

But to address Graham's snarkiness, yes, people (guys especially) think
they're supposed to dance like that now because if there's dancing at shows,
that's the kind of dancing there is.  They may not actually think they look
like John Travolta; they just think that's what dancing *means*.  (And in their
environs, it *does*; not just that they haven't learned any different, but
also that the kind of music they're choosing to be used to - which is, pace
Emily, not the only kind of popular music there is - is optimized for
promoting that kind of dance, that expresses the beat and doesn't take a lot of
thought or work.

Meantime, over in the country music world, there's lots of people in their
20s-50s two-stepping, slow-dancing, waltzing, jiving, and doing the Cotton-Eyed
Joe, to music that supports that kind of thing.

The reason I say "yes and no", above, is that your diagnosis of why they don't
want somebody telling them what to do isn't the only reason.

I am acquainted with a guy who has won a Charleston contest competing against
members of a display team.  He's a superb Victorian and ragtime dancer, waltzes
beautifully, does one-step and two-step with tremendous style, nicely display
the difference between 'teens foxtrot and '30s foxtrot.  He performs Victorian
songs in music hall and has appeared in revivals of 20s and 30s musicals; has
an extensive collection of glass-disk records, and has both a wind-up portable
gramophone and a big console gramophone at home, which he listens to when he's
not playing pre-1940 music on the piano or experimenting with recipes from
pre-1950 promotional cookbooks.  (I do not, I assure you, exaggerate about any
of this.)

Even though, as a historical enthusiast, he likes the idea of ECD, he is
completely uninterested in having anybody tell him how to express the music.
He's the lead; it should be up to him.  Execute a set pattern?  Pfui!  (No, he doesn't
quote Nero Wolfe there, but that's approximately the position.)

(Now, he was perfectly willing to take classes to learn how to do each of the
couple-dance genres he was interested in doing, and to work hard to learn a
choreography he was going to perform, but the idea of having somebody telling
him what to do on every dance is repugnant to him.  It doesn't help that his
first exposure to that sort of thing was a famously windy teacher who will
interupt his 45-minute teaching of "Hole in the Wall" with a 20 minute "how to
walk" lesson.  I do not exaggerate about this either.)

I'm not sure that's necessarily true.  It really depends on how the
expectations are set.  And just as there are some people who can pick up any
instrument and figure out how to play it, without instruction, well enough to
get a recognizable tune in a few minutes, there are some people who are
visual/tactile enough, and fearless enough, to watch a dance form and start
doing it, without lessons. (And if your idea of couple dancing comes from
watching musical comedies, you may not think through the whole idea of needing
lessons, even if you do.)

Well, the ones we see in the movies like "1941" are.  (Great jitterbug into
brawl sequence in that movie, which has many terrific moments but doesn't, I
think, work as a whole.)

(Parenthetically, it seems like country-dancing is still the only thing where
the basic unit is the couple and couples interact, couple by couple, but I
notice that various apparently couple-dance-only forms end up generating their
own group dances.  Flappers (and their men) might Charleston with partners or
join a Charleston circle; swing dancers might join a big circle to do a Big
Apple or a shim-sham, and sock-hoppers might make two lines and do the Madison,
if I'm remembering the name right.  Do ravers follow that impulse as well?)

I'm expecting it was just about as much work as Hermes Pan did with Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers to learn their intricate moves.  However, you've
missed Graham's irony.  To unpack it, he was suggesting that people who
bob up and down like chickens on the dance floor apparently have a mistaken
image in their heads that they look as cool as John Travolta did in that dance.

I'd prefer it, incidentally, if you objected a little less robustly.  (It's
fine to disagree, but it seems impolite to me to say "What crap!")

But the difference since the 1960s is that, in non-structured couple dance
situations, you're _expected_ to look cool on the dance floor without
instruction.  And people who are worried about looking like klutzes don't get
out there - which is why we have that whole "dance like there's nobody
watching" meme - and are cut off from joy of movement and communal being, and
dance isn't part of daily life, as it damned well ought to be.

I have always defined dance as something that involved
moving through space, so it wasn't until I found ECD

Just because I'm persnickety, I'll point out that "hopping up and down"
is moving through space; it's just on a different axis than you're
thinking.

That said, I kinda feel the same way.  I'm only now coming around to
appreciating that there's anything at all fun for me in couple dances that
don't travel ("slot dances" like jitterbug).  This predisposition may be
one of those brain structure things that make ECD easier or harder to learn
for some people.

(I don't know whether the predilection or predisposition for ECD is actually ny
less common now than it was in, oh, 1773, or whether intensive training
overcame the absence of it, or whether there were just fewer alternative
entertainment opportunities, or whether, finally, a lot of people weren't
actually doing it for fun, but rather to display their accomplishments in hopes
of catching a partner.  Nowadays, there's no reason to do it if you don't like
it.)

Is this a cue to start discussing "The Happy Clown", an ECD scorned by Thomas Wilson
in the early 19th century for including the move of dancers hopping  up and down in place
repeatedly?

 From my perspective, i think Cammy's right.  Grass-roots publicity
works.  Relentless enthusiasm by the right person (or people) at the
right time can bring in enough young dancers to provide critical
mass.  Of course, it helps if the enthusiast is in the same age
group, or in some sense a peer.  (Fellow student?  Team member of
some other sport?  Part of the same singing club or reenactment
group?  Anything else in common?)

Growing a dance (regardless of the age of the prospective dancers)
does take that kind of relentless enthusiasm.  Exhausting, but
necessary... best if several people share the enthusiasm, rather than
just one.  Since most of us work for a living and have precious
little free time, we rarely manage to put in the necessary effort to
recruit.  But absolutely no advertising works as well as a
graciously, enthusiastically offered personal invitation...

My hat's off to Cammy!

cheers - Linda

New dance, "Trip to Africa"

Serendipity!!  Next year, it's off to Africa on an English dance
cruise.  Coincidentally, I'd been working on a dance to do justice
to the beautiful tunes in the Sacred Harp piece, "Africa," by the
great American composer, William Billings.  In the "trip"
tradition, "Trip to Africa" seemed like a good name.  (Perhaps
one day a Pinewoods Camp toilet will be named after it,
following *that* grand tradition.)

Please ignore any earlier versions you may have encountered.  After
much changing and refining (with the help of many patient musicians
and dance volunteers), here's the final glitch-free version.  At the
indicated tempo, it flows nicely, with a touch of majesty to mirror
Billings' glorious music.  The final set of Labor Day volunteers gave
it high marks.  Give it a try.  Below are the calls (in CAPS) and
teaching instructions.  The music will go out separately, as a pdf file.

Incidentally, let me know (off line) if you'd like copies of my two
previous dances, which have been well received:
.   "Crazy Marie" (a captivating Norwegian tune, with the perfectly
matched "B" part kindly added by Jonathan Jensen), and
.    "Gower Wassail" (terrific tune from South Wales, often used in
Revels productions).

I've been a little lax in whacking people who post in HTML lately.

Don't do that.  Use expita.com/nomime.html to learn how to turn off HTML
postings in your mailer software.

But even more:

 DON'T POST BINARIES TO THE LIST.  PDFs ARE BINARIES.  Digest readers will see
them as page after page after page of gibberish!  If you have binaries, put
them on a website - there are free web services available, heaven knows - and
post a link.

My humble apologies to the list, for any gibberish you may have
received connected to the "Trip to Africa" dance.  I think it's a
good dance and deserved better treatment.  Below, once again,
the calls and instructions, sent in PLAIN TEXT.  For the
MUSIC, email me OFF LINE, solweber-AT-juno.com, and
I'll send it to you.

New dance, "Trip to Africa"

Serendipity!!  Next year, it's off to Africa on an English dance
cruise.  Coincidentally, I'd been working on a dance to do justice
to the beautiful tunes in the Sacred Harp piece, "Africa," by the
great American composer, William Billings.  In the "trip"
tradition, "Trip to Africa" seemed like a good name.  (Perhaps
one day a Pinewoods Camp toilet will be named after it,
following *that* grand tradition.)

Please ignore any earlier versions you may have encountered.  After
much changing and refining (with the help of many patient musicians
and dance volunteers), here's the final glitch-free version.  At the
indicated tempo, it flows nicely, with a touch of majesty to mirror
Billings' glorious music.  The final set of Labor Day volunteers gave
it high marks.  Give it a try.  Below are the calls (in CAPS) and
teaching instructions.  The music will go out separately, as a pdf file.

Incidentally, let me know (off line) if you'd like copies of my two
previous dances, which have been well received:
.   "Crazy Marie" (a captivating Norwegian tune, with the perfectly
matched "B" part kindly added by Jonathan Jensen), and
.    "Gower Wassail" (terrific tune from South Wales, often used in
Revels productions).

Wow, an ECD to a shape-note tune.  That's a really great idea.

Someone should do a dance to one of the fuguing tunes, with a four-part
canonic section in the dance to match, maybe like a four-couple set dance
with the couples starting to move as the different voices come in.  It
would be pretty hard to dance, probably, since the four parts would all be
different, as distinct from something like "John Tallis' Canon" where the
parts are the same but just done at different times.  But that can be the
choreographic challenge, I guess.  "Milford" would be good; it's got TWO
fuguing entrances, as I recall: "We well may imitate" and "Now he again is
born."

Sounds like a case study for Richard Powers' workshop on "What can

The mosh-pit hambo at the Saturday Contra dances in Portland gets a
bit better after the Monday night Scandi group has their annual hambo
teaching sessions.

Reminds me of Kamikaze Zwiefaches at NEFFA; the ones after about ten
minutes into the session when people who don't know how to waltz and
pivot hit the floor.

Being the one whose inadvertant message, which I meant to only send
to one person, started this mess, I have to add my two cents.

I'm on several lists that reply to the list. I was on one that
replied to the individual posters and found it frustrating. I agree
with Emily who stated that sending only to the individual, and having
to make a consious effort to reply to the whole list, stifles
conversation and discussion. That's much of the reason I haven't
cared much about being on that one list. Conversations got started,
then went dead because the discussion went off list. Sometimes one
person would bring it back on-list, but several postings later, so
much of what had been discussed was lost.

I'm all for the occassional embarassment. (Actually, I don't feel at
all embarased with what I wrote going out to the list.)

Now there is a subject for debate! Ask UK callers how infrequently they do a
waltz, and why?

Obviously, waltzing is more prevalent in USA perhaps.

I've had a very interesting time at what I guess I'd have to describe
as a techno/rave/goth sort of dance doing cross-step waltz across the
music.  It wasn't difficult to avoid the people who were just dancing
in place, and they were mostly pretty friendly about letting us whirl
by.  There was one rude exception to this.

Separately, last week I was pleased to find something (cross-step
foxtrot in S-QQ rhythm) that one could dance to Loreena McKennitt's
"All Soul's Night".

"Beach Spring" is quite a nice dance set to a beautiful tune. I think
it deserves to be known more widely. I really enjoy seeing the faces
of the other half of the set going by in the serpentine figure.

Or Germany, in the case of Zweifache. It is a German waltz/pivot
dance. It is not just a waltz tune. One of the simplest has a rhythm
that just repeats wwpp, but they can get very complicated. At NEFFA
they put a poster up with the formula for the dance being done, but
you really just have to listen to the music and do what it tells you
to do. You _must_ be able to do a turning waltz, and you _must_ be
able to get around on pivot steps, or you end up running into
everyone around you, thus the kamikaze designation.

Here's a web page: <http://www.germandance.org/zwiefache.html>

As Napoleon threatened to invade the sceptered Isle of England, Horatio
Nelson, Read Admiral of the White, took the fleet under his command to find
and defeat the combined navies of France and Spain.  Already a hero after
his brilliant leadership in other naval victories, especially the Battle of
Nile in 1798,  Nelson had the hearts of the English people as well as the
seamen and officers who served under him.  Willing to break the
long-established rules of naval warfare, he had brought his homeland
victories and France its few defeats.

In the summer of 1805, Nelson gathered 33 ships and led a sometimes
wild-goose chase across the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas trying to
second-guess where the enemy fleet may be hiding.  But on the evening of
Oct. 20, he finally caught up with the fleet off the Cape of Trafalgar,
Spain under Admiral Villaneuve.  Villaneuve knew that his 15,000 sailors
were under-trained and under-equipped, and had been driven into hiding at
Cadiz for several weeks, even though he outnumbered the English ships.  But
under direct orders from Napoleon to go out and fight, he set sail and ran
right into Nelson's squadron.

What Nelson did that evening and the next morning were documented with
reverence.  He met with his captains to give them the battle orders, which he
called the "Nelson Touch."  (Bold movement straight at ships lined up to
produce mass broadsides.)  He wrote last letters to his daughter Horatia and
her mother, Emma Hamilton, his mistress of many years.  Being a generally
melancholy fellow, he also wrote a will in which he asked his nation to support
the common-law family he was leaving behind.  He said a famous prayer, and on
deck dictated his well-known signal to the fleet, "England expects that every
man will do his duty."

Moving large fleets takes time so it was mid-day before the two armadas met in
combat on the 21st.  True to form, the French-Spanish fleet was lined up to
maximize their firepower, but Nelson's ships were proceeding in spearhead lines
that were going to cut into the defenses into order to rake the enemy ships
(firing down the length rather than broadside).  The tactic was a gamble
because the English ships were vulnerable to raking themselves until close
enough for action. But as they were moving targets, the odds were still in
their favor, and it worked.

Not long after Nelson's flagship, the "Victory," engaged three French
ships, a sniper on board the "Redoubtable" fired a shot that entered
Nelson's shoulder and traveled down into his spine.  The damage was too
extensive for treatment, and he was taken below to made a comfortable as
possible before the end.  He lived long enough to hear from his close
friend Captain Hardy that they had won a tremendous victory, having
destroyed, damaged or captured the majority of the enemy fleet.  Only a
third of the French sailors made it back to port, and many were
wounded.  It was the worst defeat ever inflicted on a British enemy.

When England received the news of the victory almost two weeks later the
rejoicing was tempered by the lose of their greatest hero.  There were
balls and bonfires around the country, but the nation really pulled out all
the stops for Nelson's funeral when his body arrived preserved in a cask of
liquor.  His coffin was made out of the mast of the "Orient," the French
flagship (one of the largest ever built) that had been blown up during the
Battle of the Nile.  His procession was witnessed by huge crowds of
mourners, and he was interred in Westminster Abbey, along with royalty and
notables.

The "Victory" is the only preserved war ship of its time.  Visitors to
Greenwich can tour her and see where Nelson was shot and where he died
below decks.  Celebrations of  this year's 200th anniversary of the battle
and Nelson's triumph and death have taken place all year in Britain.  Our
event is but a modest tribute to both the man and the achievement.

The best zweifaches are those which are not briefed, but rather just
played.  For those who read zweifach music it is just note, and it is
up to the musician to determine how to break it out.  I recall one
dance years ago, and finally gave up.  After the dance the musician
told me it was play all waltz! with to pivot!

Works best with an umpah instrument so that the pivots are really clear.

Small correction needed here.
    Horatio, Lord nelson was interred in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral,
in the City of London,  not in Westminster Abbey, in the City of
Westminster.

Painting with VERY broad strokes, I have long felt that where Westminster is "royal," St Paul's is
"national." Military heroes and military engagements feel more present somehow at St Pauls.

Tell your band that the tune for "That Night at Trafalgar" would make a
stunning grand march.  It's by Howard Evans, recorded by Brass Monkey, with
words by Thomas Hardy though of course that wouldn't matter if they used it
as an instrumental.  I expect there'd be a few Brass Monkey fans in the
crowd -- they're quite a popular band among English folkie types -- and
they'd pick up on how appropriate it is.  The B part switches between 4/4
and 5/4, but I guarantee nobody would notice.  On the CD they switch into
"Prince William," another great march tune if you're not using it in the
program.

Incidentally, in the song, they pronounce it TRAfalgar, with the accent on
the first syllable.  (In Spanish, you'd put the accent on the last
syllable, since it doesn't end with a vowel, an 'n', or an 's'.  How in the
world did we end up with the accent in the middle?

Probably the same way Chalmondeley ended up being pronounced "Chumley".

Jon, you've just told the band directly without needing Alan's
mediation.
Thanks for drawing my attention to an apt song found on a CD no further
away than my basement. For the ball's grand march, I've been assembling
a medley of period songs (such as Dibden's "Tom Bowling"). If I do
stray from the
circa 1800 straight-and-narrow, this "collaboration" between a later
19th century poet/novelist and a later 20th century trumpet player
is tempting to use.

In the mid October nighttime
When the wind raved round the land
And the back sea met the front sea
And our doors were blocked with sand
And we heard the drub of Dead Man's Bay
Where bones of thousands are
We knew not what the day had done
Done for us at Trafalgar

Pull hard and make the North
Or down we go, one says, says he
We pulled and bedtime brought the storm
Home snug slept we
But our gallants all the while
After fighting through the day
Were beating up and down the dark
Sou' west of Cadiz Bay

The victor and the vanquished
Then the storm it tossed and tore
As hard they strove those worn out men
Upon that surly shore
Dead Nelson and his half dead crew
His foes from near and far
Were rolled together on the deep
That night at Trafalgar

About your puzzlement:  Probably because *any* movement to music is dancing,
by definition.

Ancient ceremonies or celebrations (religious or secular) that involve music
and rhythmical movements aren't choreographed in any way but clearly the
participants are dancing.

Now, 'dancing really well' is a pretty snooty and entirely subjective call,
isn't it?  How about just appreciating that people are celebrating,
expressing themselves and enjoying themselves?  A dance competition, okay.
But those are few are far between.

Yes, dancing *is* easy. Dancing to satisfy some elevated expectations,
justified or otherwise, is not.

I guess you're one of those people who believes that if one's singing voice
isn't 'up to snuff', best to contain it to the shower...preferably at a
whisper.

I like to appreciate *everyone's* dancing, especially in a social setting.
Okay, sometimes it's a challenge, but if the arts were only limited to the
talented, nobody would ever even try.

I think that looking cool at an unstructured dance is a function of dress,
physical attractiveness, grace and style rather than on 'personal
choreography'.  Remember, at an unstructured dance, your intent is to
attract a mate (even -- or especially -- a temporary one).  Yes, if someone
doesn't care how they are viewed, they'll be more...uh, creative.  Often,
alcohol is involved. ;>

That entire situation is rarely present at ECDs or similar folk dances.

Well, first, we were talking about a country dance setting.  It's a challenge
to appreciate the dancing of someone at a country dance who doesn't want to
learn how the dances go.  They're engaged in a different enterprise than we
are.  THe question isn't talent - it's willingness and cooperation.

I think you're off the beam here.  Didn't this start with Jon wondering why
someone would go to a contradance and complain about having somebody (eg, a
caller) tell them what to do all the time?  So Graham was commenting on how
their expectations might have been set by the idea that they were doing a great
job with dancing ("like John Travolta") by jumping up and down.

Now, Graham is a discriminating and discerning observer who knows good dancing
when he sees it - and you'd better be, if you're going to be a dance leader who
helps people improve their dancing - but that doesn't, of itself, make him a
snooty person who thinks klutzes shouldn't dance in public.

And I think it would be be more in keeping with the tone I'd like the list to
have if list denizens disagreed with what people specifically said rather than
with their assumptions about what kind of person their statements have revealed
them to be.  Thanks.

Maybe so.  But "grace and style" inform your personal choreography.

Also, this means that at, eg, high school dances, the cool kids look cool, and
if the geeks and nerds overcome their shyness and reluctance and try to dance,
they'll reinforce their low status.  Which is part of why I think unstructured
dancing has produced unpleasant/scary experiences for many people, who
therefore have been turned off to dancing as a participatory activity, despite
the fact that unstructured dancing - no lessons, no rules - would seem to be as
entry-level a form as you can get.

Alcohol is involved in lowering inhibitions enough to get out on the dance
floor at all, and not worry as much about how much like a geek you look.

Except, to some extent, English ceilidh in England.

There's actually an entire sub-genre of music called 'Extreme Polka' and
Polkacide was one of the first.  Others include Polkaholics, Those Darn
Accordions and Big Lou the
Accordion Princess.

http://clevelandintl.com/extremepolka.htm

http://polkaboy.typepad.com/polkaholics/2005/09/extreme_polka_w.html

http://www.clevelandintl.com/biglou.html

There's also 'Gangsta Polka' which is Mexican music about drug dealers and
smugglers.  It was even featured in an episode of CSI: Las Vegas.

Certainly the rare person who just wants to dance and not learn first is a
problem, but it's quickly addressed and solved.  But it's also a concern
when expectations by the experienced dancers and callers are too high.  That
can really kill a beginner's interest.  I wonder how many first-timers are
turned off by the unreasonably heightened expectations.

There isn't a 'beam' in discussion threads.  Where it starts and where it
goes is as fluid as any other conversation.  I think we're much more likely
to encounter people who have seen ECD in a movie or TV show and want to
learn how to do it, not show up expecting to just 'do' it.

Good to know and I'm sure most of us are, too.  That really wasn't I said,
however, nor was it the context of the discussion.  Klutzes are usually just
beginners and good dancing at an ECD can, I think, be just about *anybody*
dancing.  This is dancing for the masses and it should be presented and
appreciated as such.

More of a suspicion than an assumption.  And disagreements presented with
evidence is what makes for stimulating and informative conversation.

Effect it or substitute for it, but not inform it, unless the personal
choreography is from prior experience.  'Choreography' implies pre-planning
and training whereas 'grace and style' at an unstructured social dancing is
more instinctual.

Yep.  But success -- like 'luck' -- occurs when planning meets opportunity.
Nobody runs onto the football field and becomes an instant athlete.  If
geeks and nerds want to 'get the girl' at a dance, they're well-adviced to
get dancing lessons beforehand.  A lot of the cruelty in school social
situations is because unprepared participants are unfairly critized for
their failure to succeed in activities for which they have had no previous
training.

Of course, calling a Morris Dance an 'ale' indicates that it probably should

Um, Tom, maybe *your* intent in going to unstructured dances is to
attract a mate.  I actually go to dance, just like at any other dance
event.  Please don't generalize from your own intentions.

Certainly not.  Having just had the delightful experience of being on a
weekend camp program with Graham, I greatly admired his skill and patience
in nursing along a group of people with wildly varying abilities into a
joyous and harmonious whole.  He didn't even look too tense when our
set got frisky and silly this morning.

Not speaking with Alan's authority here, but I'd personally like it if
people would not repost other people's entire posts at the bottom of
theirs when there's no new content added.  It's a lot of junk to scroll
through for no reason.  Delete is your friend.

The Journal of "We Need to Get These People, Many of Whom Didn't Come To Any
Workshops, On Their Feet Somehow Without Turning it Into a Class Instead of A
Ball", published three times a year inthe SF Bay Area from 1985 to date.

In other words, I can't justify it historically, only through expediency.

What's the earliest you know about grand marches / polonaises?

1822, and it's a unicum.  I would've been thrilled to be supplied with
an earlier date.  The polonaise in particular is almost certainly
older, but specifics are lacking.  I think the first detailed
description I have is late 1820's (and in German, sigh), but I think
it's mentioned in some of Wilson's earlier advertising as one of the
things he taught.

I was thrilled to find (in an English manual!) the 1822 one, which was
supposedly danced at the congress at Aix-la-Chapelle, for reasons
summed up nicely by your journal title.  If you still have one of my
little Assembly booklets, the sequence is in that.  If not, I have
one more of my 2004 edition going begging.  :)

I believe I also saw a writeup in the Proceedings of the Royal "If We Don't
Let Them Get The Part About Scoping Out Each Other's Outfits Out Of The
Way, They'll Be Looking All Over The Room For The Entire First Dance And
Probably Run Into Each Other" Society.

Great excitement in the Broadbridge household last week with the release of
the new film of Pride and Prejudice, which stars Keira Knightley and Matthew
MacFadyen as the star crossed lovers, with Brenda Blethyn and Donald
Sutherland as her parents and Judi Dench as the overbearing Lady Catherine
de Bourgh; and featuring Aidan Broadbridge as "Dance Musician/Fiddler"
leading the bands at the two Balls, and heard playing solo for "the big
dance" - you know, the one where Elizabeth and Darcy dance together for the
first time.

Jane Gibson, the choreographer, uses Aidan for preference, both for
rehearsals and, in this case, on set, whenever she has Country Dance to do
for film or TV. She chose all the dances used in this film from three of our
CDs, namely 'Dance & Danceability', 'A Purcell Ball' and 'Purcell, Encore!'
If anyone is interested, I can supply a list of the dances used.

It's a delightful film, shot almost entirely on location using eminently
suitable houses, and with really good period mises en scenes - great
attention to agricultural details including livestock breeds of the time.

Reviews so far are almost universally enthusiastic

Pictures of Aidan in costume will be up on the web site imminently!

I can whole heartedly agree with Nic. The dance scenes were a lot more believable than the previous version. They were filmed from a more sympathetic angle giving a better flavour of the dance. The music was excellent and supported the film very giving the film a much better air of authenticity. The costuming also appeared to be well done, although I am no expert by any means, adding to the believability.

The acting was also excellent. There was humour, where needed, that did not seem out of place. The wit that was also displayed added greatly to the enjoyment of the film.

Whilst I recognised all the dance tunes putting names to some of the dance proved a bit more difficult. I would appreciate it, Nic, if you could send me a list of the dances.

The following comes from a fiddle List, and really addresses an instrumental and vocal performance, but I thought it had some good ideas for all performers.

This is known a "pacing" your show.  In general, you'll want to vary
it throughout your show.  I can't guarantee that what works for me will work
for you, but basicly I learned about pacing by analyzing sitcoms on
television, and by experimenting with the ideas in front of live groups,
mostly in seniors type environments.   If you observe carefully, you'll see
a lot of similarities among all of them, and you can put it to work for your
group.

You can break your set down into 3 parts, the opening, mid-program and the
close.

The opening runs 3 to four tunes.  Here you want to pace the program a
little faster, with shorter pauses between the tunes, perhaps putting a pair
of tunes back to back with only a pause to allow for applause.  In the
opening there are a few things you need to accomplish.

First,

you need to prove yourself to the audience.  This is easier than it
sounds.  You do this by demonstrating the full breadth of your material, and
giving them a glimpse of what is to come.  You might try a few instrumentals
to begin, and conclude the opening with an up-tempo vocal.  I like to choose
powerful tunes for the opening, with varying rhythm and keys.  If changing
capos is going to slow this part of the show, keep them all in the same key.
I've never been able to successfully open a program with a slow tune or a
soft tune.  It is very difficult to recover from that.   This is the time to
demonstrate your power. Wait until after you have proven yourself before
introducing the individuals in your group.   After you have opened, your
audience will be much more interested in learning about the your group.
Save the intros until then.

Secondly, you need to follow some protocols throughout your program. By
delivering a few items of etiquette to break the ice, you can establish
rapport with your audience.  The most important thing here is to let your
audience know that you are "happy to be there".  You have to find a
way to
express this through your voice and through your body language.  Be
animated.  Display motion, and vary your tone of voice.  If your group is
deadly nervous, it often carries the opposite message.  In that case, you
can tell them you are nervous, but emphasize that you are thrilled to be
able to perform for them.

Those are your objectives for opening the show.  Prove yourself and let them
know you are going to enjoy yourselves.  This lasts for  3, maybe four
tunes.  You can refine your opening by experimenting with the tunes you
include in your opening.  Try substituting different tunes into the opening.
Try playing the tunes a little differently, perhaps punching them up and
aiming for a high energy level.  If you're going to include some humour
later in your show, you need to include a hint of it in the opening,
otherwise it will fall flat later.

The mid-program.  You've just concluded a high energy opening and you can
feel your toes buzzing....you've given them a hint of what is to come.
Coming out of the opening, many groups begin to relax at this point.  It is
good to relax, but absolutely, without question, keep your focus on the
audience.  In fact, this is a good time to increase your focus on the
audience.  Try to understand their needs.  Emotionally, their feelings will
parallel yours, so you can use your feelings as a quide.  If you feel bored,
they will too.  If you are excited, they will be too.  If you have the gut
feeling that you really want to do a pretty tune for them, they will be
ready for it.  Learn to tune in to your gut feelings to guide you through
this part of your show.  Now your audience will be interested in hearing a
little about you and your group.  They are ready for more detailed
introductions.  They definitely do want to know more about you.  This is a
great time to spend a little extra time between tunes.  It is also a great
time to follow with a slow soft tune.  Bring the energy level down, and give
them something completely different.  From here, until the close, you want
to get as much variety into the program as possible.  You want to establish
as deep a connection as possible with them as well.   A sprinkling of
personal stories or humour helps with that, as does eye contact, and asking
questions of the audience.  Again, if you're going to ask questions of the
audience you need to include at least one in the opening, ("Hey, how many
people want some corn-liquor?" :O) otherwise it will be tough to get a good

response to your questions in the mid-program.

You can take a bit more time between tunes, and experiment from show to show
with the way you introduce the tunes.  With time and experience you can
learn to "set up" a tune so that it is received more positively.  In a

seniors setting, often a good part of your audience will have memory
problems,  especially in transferring info from short term memory to long
term memory.  Short term memory is good for about 20 seconds.  As a result,
long stories often won't help you much.  You can substitute a few short ones
instead.

Familiar tunes can help with a seniors audience as well.  It can really help
to follow your slow tune with a few tunes they can hum or sing along with.
You really want to try to include them in the program as much as possible
throughout the mid program.  Basicly you are forming a deeper relationship
with them. Just as in meeting a new friend, you are forming the basis for a
deeper relationship here.  Letting them know you a little better, getting to
know them better, sharing a laugh or two.  It's really pretty natural, if
you think about it that way.

Your mid program will last about 6 or 7 tunes, and you want to finish it out
on a pretty high energy level, but at a lower energy level than your close.
As you move into the close, you want to pick up the pacing a little bit,
shorter time between tunes, etc.  You can begin the close with another soft,
sweet tune, followed by something with a little more energy.  This gives an
indication to your audience that your time together is coming to an close.
Just as you would with a dear friend, you might spend a little more time
chatting before you say your final goodbye, in this case giving them a
"closing" tune, which may be your highest energy piece.  You can
follow your
closing tune with a tune that says "goodbye", such as Smile the While,
or No
Place Like Home...substitue your favourite here.

In a nutshell, you want to pace the program faster at the beginning and at
the end.  In the middle, you want to get as much variety into the program as
possible...varying the rhythms, keys, perhaps including humour, short
stories, audience participation, juggling, novelty tunes, whatever,
.....including as many different elements as possible.

hope this helps in some small way....

I did say "almost universally enthusiastic" - and sadly one does not count
on too much enthusiasm for any British film from the western side of the
Atlantic. :-(

However, the list of dances :-)

Tythe Pig - Black Bess - Young Widow - Wakefield Hunt - Duke of Gloucester's
March - The Bishop - Moniek's Maggot (tune for - dance is concocted by the
choreographer) - Dutch Dollars.

Scotch Measure also featured in the filming, but alas, must have landed on
the cutting room floor!

Subject: [ECD] Hornpipes
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="iso-8859-1"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable

Tracey Middleton (half of the accordion duo "Amaryllis") has asked me
for some information on hornpipes.  She and David are running a
workshop at an accordionists convention (people who play "classical"
accordion and probably don't know anything about playing for dancing)
and because of the Nelson connection this year their topic is
Hornpipes.  She asked me what I knew about their evolution.  Here's
what I know (or at any rate believe) - I'm sure the collective wisdom
of the ECD List can come up with lots more.

I assume the original hornpipe was a pipe made from a horn, presumably
with finger holes, used as a fairly primitive musical instrument.

In musical terms, originally the hornpipe was a triple-time tune:
"Dick's Maggot" and "Mr Isaac's Maggot" are hornpipes.

A Scottish hornpipe is what I would call a rant.  My definition of a
rant is "a tune which ends dubber-diddy dubber-diddy dum, boom boom".
Think of "Soldiers' Joy" or "Morpeth Rant".

The tune "Sailor's Hornpipe" is a Scottish hornpipe (as you can see
from my definition, it's a rant in English terms).

I believe that sailors really did dance a hornpipe, which was a solo
showing-off dance, though maybe it got modified in the Music Halls or
when performed in films - this is pure conjecture.

In current English dance circles, a hornpipe is a strongly dotted tune
to which you would do a step-hop.  Nottingham Swing (often to the tune
"Philabelula all the way") is the best-known example, but there are
many others, new and old, though these days they are mainly the
province of ceilidh dancers.

A hornpipe is similar to a Schottishe, to which you would tend to
dance one-two-three-hop rather than step-hop, step-hop, though in fact
you can easily do either to either.

There is also an undotted hornpipe.  Bob Lilley chose one of these
when his dance "The Fast Packet" was published in CDSS News, since
Americans expect every English dance to have its own tune.  He told me
he did this just to be different, and every time I've danced it in
England it's been to a dotted hornpipe.

In the States, among contra dance musicians, the dots have been taken
out and basically a hornpipe is the same as a reel.  For instance,
"Fisher's Hornpipe is a traditional dance tune dating back to the late
1700's according to the web page
http://www.melbay.com/mandolinsessions/feb05/building.html

You can see the music there, and if you gave it to a traditional
English musician he would certainly dot it, as in the last example on
this page (interestingly classed as a "Celtic Hornpipe").

So my questions are:

Do people agree or disagree with what I've written here, and can they
add any more?

In contra dance music is there any audible difference between a reel
and a hornpipe?  Is the notational difference that a hornpipe is
always written with four beats to the bar and a reel with two?

When was the first recorded triple-time hornpipe?

When and why did a hornpipe change from triple time to duple time?

My instructions for Fast Packet do not include any tune at all, but
just that it can be done to a reel or a hornpipe. I had always called
it to a (dotted) hornpipe until a week ago when I was calling with a
band for whom that request would have been a problem. So I told them to
play a reel. I then discovered (to my chagrin) that I should have
thought about this more, as a standard reel at contra dance speed
requires twice through the tune for once for this dance  (or an extreme
slow-down of tempo).

> So my questions are:

Not a bit that I can tell. Basically "hornpipe" and "reel" are just
different "last names" of some tunes, as in "Judy's Reel" or "Fisher's
Hornpipe."

> always written with four beats to the bar and a reel with two?
I have seen  both reels and hornpipes written either way.

Colin, the latest issue of EFDSS Mag has something on sailor's hornpipe--I neither read it carefully nor retained much except that the author believes it to be a solo stage dance developed in the 1780s or so (think also of Mr. Durang's famous Hornpipe of the same time period here in US) and gradually by association moved from stage to ship whence it was collected as a quintessentially English dance, representing "a nation of proud sailors," to quote Mrs. Grace Kimmins of the Guild of Play in 1910.
To me, tune-wise (this is harder to write about than to play) an undotted hornpipe such as Fisher's contains more intervals of thirds (very easy on concertina) and fewer scales or octave jumps, the latter of which tends to be easier on fiddle and are more characteristic of reels. Maybe another way to say it--and I'm sure I'll get beaten up for this--is that if you took a tune like Fisher's and added dots, you'd say, "Ah, yes, a classic hornpipe," whereas if you took a straight-up reel and put dots in, it might (cringing) sound more like a strathspey (without the Scotch snap, I hasten to add).

And for a group of accordionists, don't forget to include the hornpipe
in Ireland.  It's used in solo dancing as well as set dancing (and is
the best part of the set, in my personal opinion).

Here's what Pat Murphy has to say about the hornpipe in _Toss the
Feathers_:
"The hornpipe is first mentioned in the time of Henry VIII by
Chappell.  It is generally accepted, except by the most partisan Irish
historians, as being of English origin.  It is believed to have
arrived in Ireland around the beginning of the eighteenth century.
Joe O'Donovan, Cork step-dancer and teacher, has a reference [personal
sources] to an agreement between Charles Staunton, dancing-master, and
William Bailey of Ballincollig, West Cork in 1718, whereby Bailey was
to pay him two guineas to teach his children 'jig minnets [minuets],
hornpipes and country dances'."

Murphy describes the hornpipe steps as "similar to those described
here for a reel, though naturally danced at a slower speed.  The
movement transferring weight from the ball of the foot to the heel of
the same foot is usually a more emphasised 'hop' when dancing to a
hornpipe."

In set dancing, the hornpipe figure is usually one of the last
figures, and is often a mixer.

In most respects, I agree with your history /conjecture.

In regards to the contra hornpipe tunes:
I always assumed such tunes "used" to be dotted hornpipes and were adapted
to contradancing by playing them as even duple meter tunes. The difference
between hornpipe and reel from a contradance musician's perspective is
that I can generally play the hornpipes with a dotted (and often slower)
rhythm and they sound good if not better (e.g., Fisher's, Woodchopper's,
President Garfield's, Lamplighter's) whereas many of the reels don't feel
as "meant to be" when I try to play them with the dotted rhythm (e.g.,
Lady Walpole's Reel, Judy's Reel). We generally do not play a dotted
rhythm or slow the tempo for contras. Also, I find it hard to speed up a
dotted hornpipe to contra tempo without losing the dottedness. There are
many of my favorite hornpipes that I do not play for contras cause they
just don't sound good to my ear when played up to that speed (e.g., the
Gallway Hornpipe, Miriam).

In regards to 2/4 versus 4/4 meter, we play them as 2/4 (i.e., 2 steps or
step-hops per measure) regardless of how they are written. (This is
assuming that there are 8 bars per quarter of the tune; usually repeated.
For example, we often find that marches are written in 4/4 but when we use
them for contras, we play them as if it were 2/4. (If someone really
messed around with the tradition for writing these out, I suppose that you
could put 4 steps/bar in a 4 bar quarter tune in which case 4/4 would be
played half the bar-speed of a 2/4 tune).

Colin,

We went to a Sailor's Hornpipe dance workshop at Chippenham Festival run by
Martyn Harvey. In the dance notation sheets he gave us at the end he said
that the music used in Naval establishments is Pitt's Hornpipe, often
referred to as College Hornpipe, which he believes was composed by an 18th
century fiddler called Moses Dale. Any tune could have been called a
hornpipe if it was played on the hornpipe.

He also said that the sailors might well have danced this on shore - I don't
remember that bit well, but I daresay you or Tracey could ask him more
yourself, as I got the impression he has done research on the subject.

Frances
PS his workshop was very good, if a trifle strenuous!

"Hornpipe" -- the musical instrument-- in this context is the cylindrical
bore wooden instrument with finger holes like a recorder or tin whistle, an
animal horn bell (widening cone at the bottom) and animal horn mouthpiece to
accommodate a single reed, as used on the clarinet.  It's been around since
medieval times, and considered obsolete (in polite society anyway) by 1600
or so...  There are stops on the accordion that emulate the sound quite
well, so an accordionist playing hornpipes is probably not punishable by
law!  Good choice for the workshop.

[There are instruments entirely made of animal horn, such as the "gemshorn,"
with a fipple (the whistle-type opening), finger holes and a sweet soft
sound like a recorder, or the shofar, played like a bugle, used in
synagogues.  Neither would work for frisky sailors.]

Found this interesting site via Google offering a modern hornpipe
instrument.

http://www.newcelticinstruments.com/whistle_history.html

Colin, I forwarded your query about the indigenous English late 17th-c.
triple-time hornpipe dance to Carol Marsh, who might have some solid
information.  And you know all the usual Dolmetsch Historical Dance Society
suspects (Anne Daye et. al.) who could be very helpful in this...  Also
search our ECD-list archive, where some years ago there was a discussion of
the vernacular Cheshire hornpipe, the Playford 3/2 tunes, and related
matters.

Which we did at our local dance about two months ago, and the *unanimous*

Good for the movie people.

Maggot Pie, published in 1932, was the first new book of English
Country Dances since... when?  The previous Playford-style dance in my
repertoire is "Philandering", from W Blackman's "24 Country Dances and
Quadrilles" of 1826.  Were there any later publications, and do we
ever dance anything from them?

Don't hornpipes typically have a longer phrase than reels?
In my mind (and I'm not a musician) reels have an 8 beat phrase
repeated four times for each strain (A and B).
Whereas hornpipes have a 16 beat phrase that differs slightly
from the first to the second repetition.  Also hornpipes have the
"bump, bump" at the end of the second phrase.

G Wesley Brown asks -
"Don't hornpipes typically have a longer phrase than reels?
In my mind (and I'm not a musician) reels have an 8 beat phrase
repeated four times for each strain (A and B).
Whereas hornpipes have a 16 beat phrase that differs slightly
from the first to the second repetition.  Also hornpipes have the
"bump, bump" at the end of the second phrase."

The hornpipes and reels that I play don't seem to follow any particular
trend that would separate the genres. Assuming that a step in a reel is
equivalent to a step-hop in a hornpipe, most of my tunes have 16/phrase.
Both reels and hornpipes are often subdividable after 8 steps either
through recapitulation of the first 8 (with modifications near the end) or
with a second motif. But many of both types are not and run right through
all 16 without a melodic pause.

These are factors we musicians consider as we select tunes to go with a
dance (i.e., if the figure is 16 steps long, 8 step phrasing can be
confusing while 16 step phrases generally discourage people from stopping
too early and assist the dancers to get it right without lots of calling).
Another feature we consider is whether the phrases come to a solid stop at
the end as in the "bump, bump" tunes or facilitates elision of the figures
(e.g., running 16th notes through the double bar) where the final note of
the melodic phrase often doubles as beat one of the next phrase). There
may be a generalization here. Although the bump, bump, bump endings are
common in many reels, the run-through endings seem to be rare in the
hornpipes I play (and the exceptions may have been corruptions of the
original versions).

Speaking of corruptions, part of being a dance musician is being able to
adjust the melody to particularly suit the dance. Although we try to
select tunes appropriate for the dance, we often have to insert double
stops, melodic improvisations, rhythmic anomalies, etc... in order to get
the melody to be as instructive to the dancers as calls. Easy examples are
tunes like Chorus Jig where the 4th part is written the same as the second
part but since the figure begins with a balance, it is only played the
same by musicians who are oblivious to the dancers. This is relevant to
the discussion on hornpipes versus reels because we may often insert the
bump, bump, bump onto a phrase of a reel that technically doesn't have
one, or add a run to the end of a hornpipe that technically has the bumps.

Isn't it in the Playford Ball?
It is my recollection that the original tune is better suited to the
dance, but most dancers love dancing it to Miss Dolland's Delight.

The traditional name for that tune is "College Hornpipe." I don't know
if it
was commonly referred to as "Sailor's Hornpipe" before "Popeye" used it.
It's in Cole's as "College Hornpipe."

Kitty Keller once showed me the original source for this tune, and it
was
spelled "Fischer's," having been composed by one Johann Fischer.

<<Where can one find the original tune to The Bishop?>>

In Playford, a facsimile of which is in "The Playford Ball". I've done a
transcription of that, which I'd be happy to send as a .pdf to anyone who
requests it.

......... and oddly enough, having said that all the dances were selected
from three Assembly Players CDs, it also features on our 'Dance &
Danceability' :-)   We medleyed it with 'Miss Dolland's Delight' for fear of
giving offence to too many "traditionalists"! People find the change quite
exciting.

Further information on hornpipe, the musical instrument:
The most common instrument in the British Isles of this description
is the Welsh pibcorn. The single beating reed (not quite the same as
a clarinet reed) is actually identical to the drone reed used in most
types of bagpipes. Historically the reeds were made from either
arondo donex cane, or fashioned from small elder branches; makers
still use these materials. The earliest hornpipe bodies were made out
of cane, and there are hornpipe-type instruments from North Africa
and the Middle East that are still made that way. Most British Isles
varieties of hornpipes were made of wood. In all cases, the total
bore of the instrument was cylindrical in nature, with the animal
horn used as a bell for amplification. Many varieties have a horn
mouthpiece over the reed; other varieties the reeds were actually put
in the mouth directly.
--as per my husband, Mickie Zekley, founder of Lark In The Morning music

[I play a bit on the pibcorn myself, mine is made by Alan Keith
http://www.keithmusic.com
I'm afraid there's no picture of it on his website.]

Irish hornpipes are played with a dotted rhythm, but written as
straight rhythm, like a reel.
The tunes are of varying lengths. Many of the contra dance hornpipes
(and reels and jigs for that matter) were originally Irish tunes.

Thanks for all who replied as to where to find the original tune.
I checked out Michael's site at http://www.michaelbarraclough.com/michael/notations.html
and there found that the Apted reconstructors (Porter & the two Heffners) took considerable liberties with this dance: changed tune, changed rhythm from jig to 2/4, added setting, added gypsies, added gates, and some other stuff. The dance as we know it is really quite unrecognizeable compared to the originals shown in Playford Ball.
Do we know if they did this to the other Apted dances? Why did they do this? (I don't disagree that they created a great dance, but still....)

 Pride and Prejudice originally was scheduled to open on September 23, and
 so I set up our September 24th experienced English dance as a Jane Austen
 dance party for all.  (Imagine how I felt when Focus Feature changed the
 film's US release date!)

 The Austen dance takes place this coming Saturday.  So far we've been
 listed on Craigslist, sfstation & tribe.net, and hope to attract dancers
 from Dickens Fair, Bay Area English Regency Society, Gaskells, &
 PEERS.  I've also sent flyers & invitations to various UC professors who
 are teaching Austen this semester; I hope to get flyers to the classes this
 week.

 I also hope to get some dancers with flyers about our regular dance series
 to the film's November premiere.  A little street-dancing and who knows
 what loge potato will be inspired to get off his seat and dance...

 Ever optimistically,
 Sharon

 (With thanks, as always, to New York's Austen guru, the inimitable Beverly
 Francis, whom I hope to channel on Saturday night)

You might want to offer to do dance demos at opening night at a local
theatre.

I've done several sword-fighting demos when a Medieval-type movie
opened and it was a lot of fun.

Bring flyers to hand out to folks waiting in line.

Without knowing anything about it, and several hundred miles away from my dance
books here, I seem to recall that Barnes gives music for
"The Herne Bay Dance" and says "Longman, Clementi and Co" and "1832".  I don't
pretend to know any more about it than that.

But the question is, I think, at what point do we draw the line between
cotillions/quadrilles/other formations and "Playford-style" dancing?
(Especially since you clearly mean something other than
up-a-double-siding-and-arming when you say "Playford-style".)

Cruising through the Library of Congress dance book collection on line, there
are definitely books from as late as the 1850s - I'm thinking of Howe in
particular - which focus primarily on non-quadrille country dances (longways
duple, triple, and "Spanish dance"/Sicilian Circle formations), and which gain
new material in subsequent editions  Those are American books; do they count?
(Maybe not, for English country dance, but that seems a little arbitrary.)

Why, yes, of course. Of course, a tad less physically amusing than your average SCA evening, but still, sure to win hearts everywhere. Get in line and do the following:
Fans UP!: "How Dare You Pollute the Shades of Pemberley, Madam!"
Fans at 10%, in-Wards Facing: "For what do we live, but for to make fun of others, and to be laughed at at our tunr?"
Fans at 0%, Outwards-Facing: "You must allow me to tell you How Ardently I Admire You." (Big Sex Scene here, in case you skipped over it.)
And, Fans at 180%, "The Duello of Honor," sung Obbligatto by Mssrs Willoughby, Brandon, Morland, and Bertram. Woo-hoo, boys, this'll bring 'em in if nuthin will.

Does anyone know what song 19 on this Pemberly Players CD is?  It runs =

for Pemberly!)

Thanks, Allison!  Kinda cool to find a hidden track on the CD...haven't
