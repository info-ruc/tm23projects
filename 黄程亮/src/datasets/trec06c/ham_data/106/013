Oh, Alan.  You are so tactful!  "So accessible"!  Love it.

How many American dancers have any idea of how to polka?  Can you put
them all on the head of a pin.....

> (3) There's English dancing in Las Vegas?  Tell us more!

I've been living in Las Vegas since March 2001.  I have been a member of a
non-profit educational organization that recreates all aspects of life in
any society known to Europe between oh lets say 600 and 1650.  This
organization is about
To celebrate its 40th Anniversary (do organizations have Birthdays?) and I
am on their international, Arizona, and Southern California/Southern
Nevada/Hawaii regional organization dance lists.  Right now much of the
discussion I am seeing on those lists pertains to the dancing at the Grand
Ball to be held at the www.estrellawar.org event in Goodyear (Greater
Western Phoenix, AZ) in February over President's day weekend 2006.  The
biggest Grand Ball that I've ever attended .. the SCA annually holds at
www.pennsicwar.org in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania in August.  I attended in
2004 and had a blast... But that is digression... Since you asked
specifically about ECD in Las Vegas.

EC Dancing in Las Vegas, when I arrived, was limited to when Countess
Ealasaid Nic Churlain travelled up to Las Vegas from Los Angeles and
provided the teaching and the calling.  Some of you may know her as Marsden
Macrae.  I love Marsden's teaching, but we can't get her up here often
enough for the dancers to be happy.  Still she comes out several times a
year, and for that we are grateful.

Roughly three years ago, I asked Marsden about how we might set up an
English Country Dance class regularly here, and I was thinking we could have
it on campus at UNLV, and my new position of President of a recognized
student organization would help us.  Alas, while Marsden did find us a local
who could instruct us, that local instructor was not part of the "university
community" which was narrowly defined as students, staff, and faculty.

Campus insisted that I could book the room for free as a student
organization but after using it some fifty times or more, they could decide
to back bill me $200.00 a night because the instructor was alledgedly seen
to have moved their feet or participated in the dancing -- thus changing
their category from "the source of entertainment" to "non-university
community participant" the latter being their trigger to demand rent.
Nothing really to worry about there because before they'd send me the bill,
they'd block all future attempts to register for classes or procure
transcripts.  Disciplinary action for failure to pay on demand wouldn't
start until at least after two weeks from the mailing date.

I really worked hard to reverse them on their position, citing many reasons
and examples, but the end result was that we had a three-month delay and
eventually found that we could use our on-campus student organization
recognition papers to apply to the public library for access to a room, free
of charge, during library hours, and up to twice a month -- as they provide
to other non-profit organizations -- subject to the stipulation that our
classes be free and open to the public.

Yippee!  Regularly scheduled English Country Dance class began.  Our first
instructor/caller was Chris Kawa.  Later, Chris stepped back and Norma
Biggar took over.  Norma has been supplemented at times by myself, Jim Dana,
and Jeanne Russell.  I have about five dances in my reperitoire, and started
calling literally from the floor when I noticed the people nearest to me in
the dance "Hole in the Wall" were stumbling with the steps, and ever since
then "Hole in the Wall" has been mine to call.

I need to get more organized, and arrange for music to be portable on my own
equipment, and my health issues or my schoolwork keeps getting in the way.
I had surgery over the summer, so hopefully the health problems will all be
gone permanently.  I have not yet created my "calling cards" for calling
dances, nor put the music on my portable mp3 player...or my laptop.

We have been meeting on Monday evenings, from 6:30 to 8:45 (the library
closes at 9).  Mostly we get the second and third Mondays, but this month
due to Labor Day, an organization that holds its business meeting on the
first Monday moved their meeting to the second Monday, so we have only the
third Monday this month.  The room we dance in, the "Jewel Box Theater" is
not carpeted, and has a stack of chairs, two tables and a grand piano in it.
Occasionally we have live music, otherwise we use "the bard in the box".
Attendance ranges from 4-26, usually in direct proportion to the outside
temperature.... Funny not so many dancers come out in the 115+ degrees
Fahrenheit heat...  The branch is known to most locals at the "Flamingo
Library" but it's formal name is the "Clark County Library".  The address is
Clark County Library
1401 E. Flamingo Road, Las Vegas, NV 89119.  The cross street, Escondido
st., is one block east of South Maryland Parkway.

I have again begun the process toward re-recognition of the campus student
group: "University Historical Dance Enthusiasts", a process we need to do
each semester in order to keep our ability to book the ECD dates in the
library.

I personally have danced English Country dances once quarterly for two
years, then monthly for two more years, then not at all for nearly two
decades, then picked it up again at UC Berkeley in 2000.  In our dance
classes at the library, we have done English Country Dances considered "in
period" for the sponsoring group, English Country Dances considered "too
modern to be in period" for the sponsoring group, as well as other favorites
like Bransles, Pavannes, Alemandes, and I hope to introduce 15th Century
Italian dance when I feel confident or find an instructor.  I have dance
materiel from England, France, Italy and Germany running from the 15th to
17th centuries.  I personally have also danced English Regency, Contra,
Square and Israeli and International Folk dances.  I have attended classes
for Tribal Dance (about 500 years before modern Cabaret-Style Belly
Dancing), and have drummed for dancers in that style.  Which hook-ups do you
want?

I visited Las Vegas in November of 2000, and was lucky that Marsden visited
then too.  I expect she will be back here in late January or Early February
for the local "Collegium of the Desert" event which is held annually in
Henderson or Las Vegas.

Norma maintains an email list of all sorts of dancing opportunies that I
know has included English Country, Contra, Square, International Folk,
Israeli Folk, and more.. In areas near Las Vegas but inclusive of Southern
California, Arizona and Western Utah.

Does anyone in or near Phoenix, AZ want information about free dance classes
open to the public at ASU Tempe?  I can't promise that ever dance will be
English Country there.  They may do SCA favorites that are not English
Dances...

Anyone anywhere else that wants me to try to find some historical dancing
for them (through contact with one or more historical recreation groups that
I belong to) should email me privately with their city, state or province,
and country and I'll do what I can.  The last disbeliever who challenged me
was astonished that my resources included a group within seven miles of his
home in Perth, Western Austrailia.  Last I heard he had joined up and was
making armor for Knightly combat.

I did it again... I sent the mail without completing all my
thoughts...sorry.

Another topic on those lists I mentioned is the Grand Ball at
www.greatwesternwar.org.  I've never been to a GWW, and don't know how much
dancing they have usually done in prior years.  I'm not scheduled to attend
this year's GWW either, due to prior engagements that same weekend and
health concerns.  It's really quite soon.

Also I had intended to say that once the dance lists from these balls are
published, we may slant our English Dance classes toward teaching the dances
that will be at these Balls.  That way more dancers can be prepared.  This
doesn't mean that there won't be instruction at those events, but it's more
likely at the balls that the instruction provided will be refresher-type and
not new-dancer-who-has-never-seen-those-steps type instruction.

We teach every dance before we call them at the Library in Las Vegas, and I
may be starting beginners classes on campus and monthly in Bullhead City,
Arizona this semester as well.

Very few.  I do vintage dancing and know about 50 variants on
polka.  At a scottish ball once, the teacher was briefing gay
gordeons, and stated that we then polka'd.  I ask her what she
meant.  She looked at me incredulously.

After she demonstrated, I saw that she was doing a pas de bas not a polka.

I have similar comments about waltz.  There are many waltz varients
if one does vintage dancing, including 2/4 and 5/4, which way the
couple faces, etc.  boston (slow waltz) box steps, Viennese, etc.  A
waltz is step, step close, not step close step. A running watlz is
step, step step.

There...Now I have started a new thread of 2bits worth.

I just came home from Fae's much-debated "What I learned on my
vacation" dance,
and it was great.  It is possible for a group of experienced dancers to spend
almost the whole evening doing dances new to most of them and have a wonderful
time (it clearly helps to have great music).  Even with my clumsy &
inexperienced calling people were obviously enjoying "Perpetual Motion" a lot
and there were very few trouble spots. I think it shows that some things work
well in particular dance communities that wouldn't work at all in
others. Another lesson may be that since even many experienced dancers
have poor
memories for individual dances, it may matter less that dances are unfamiliar
than some of us expect because we ourselves always remember whether we've done
a dance before.  (Of course if people couldn't have fun doing all unfamiliar
dances, they would never have fun at a first dance...)

Me, too. I read the list as a digest, so there's never any danger of sending
a message to the list accidently. But don't all messages that come through the
list get "[ECD]" added to the subject line? Shouldn't that be fair warning
not to hit "reply" unless you want to post to the list?

I grew up on the south side of Chicago. A *whole* lot of people there knew
how to polka, and did so at every opportunity. The same, I gather, in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. And Pittsburgh. And plenty of other places where
folks from Eastern Europe and Scandinavia immigrated. The folks who do this
in the bars don't usually join ECD groups, though.

Peace,

I love having the [ECD] tag, thanks Alan!

This one didn't have the [ECD]...don't know why it slipped through like
that. But in general, it's a very useful clue.

Maybe this semi-interesting discussion will help those of us with holes
in our heads and punchy email reflexes. Don't count on it...

And it's just fine the way it is.

I did it again... I sent the mail without completing all my
thoughts...sorry.

Another topic on those lists I mentioned is the Grand Ball at
www.greatwesternwar.org.  I've never been to a GWW, and don't know how much
dancing they have usually done in prior years.  I'm not scheduled to attend
this year's GWW either, due to prior engagements that same weekend and
health concerns.  It's really quite soon.

Also I had intended to say that once the dance lists from these balls are
published, we may slant our English Dance classes toward teaching the dances
that will be at these Balls.  That way more dancers can be prepared.  This
doesn't mean that there won't be instruction at those events, but it's more
likely at the balls that the instruction provided will be refresher-type and
not new-dancer-who-has-never-seen-those-steps type instruction.

We teach every dance before we call them at the Library in Las Vegas, and I
may be starting beginners classes on campus and monthly in Bullhead City,
Arizona this semester as well.

All,

I came across this website on my surf through Yahoo's
picks of the week.

http://www.collectbritain.co.uk/collections/dialects/

It contains voice clips from various regions of the
United Kingdom and from different times as well.
Quite fascinating.

Also, today I pulled out my copy of the Community
Dance Manuals and realized it's been years since I had
actually tried to use any of these dances with our
regular English Country Dance sessions.  Among
American groups, how many of you use any of this
traditional material in your dance sessions.  I know
there are a few English Ceilidh groups represented.
Do you use any of these dances regularly.

Personally, I like some of the tunes a lot and am
particularly fond of hornpipes.  Some of the dances
are interesting and easily accessible.  What do you
all think?

For the Berkeley, CA English Ceilidh session (sometimes known as "Berkeley
Barn Dance"), many of those dances are valuable.  Good fun with "Nottingham
Swing", "Up the Sides and Down the Middle", "Cumberland Square 8", "Circle
Waltz", "Bonny Breast Knot", "Speed The Plough", etc. Great stuff.

It depends on what you can sell to your crowd.  There are a lot of people in
the ECD world - including those who started doing English because they were
too injured or winded to do contra any longer - who just don't want to
step-hop, gallop, or rant, or who do stepping gingerly and tentatively.
This stuff wants to be robust, though not necessarily precise; it's a
different set of expectations than a lot of ECDers have.

Also, a lot of this stuff is so accessable as to be boring to people who
enjoy intellectual challenge. This makes it good one-night-stand material,
where you're just giving people an excuse to have fun together with dancing,

If you can sell it, it's great!  If your dancers don't already have their
expectations set in a way that keeps them from enjoying it, and don't have
physical compromises, go for it!  (Nonetheless, I encourage you to give fair
warning before introducing anything with a lot of bounce; play the tune,
bounce around the room yourself, and let people know what they're getting
into before they get trapped in something that will hurt them, or be forced
to abandon their partner.)

Very few.  I do vintage dancing and know about 50 variants on polka.  At a
scottish ball once, the teacher was briefing gay gordeons, and stated that
we then polka'd.  I ask her what she meant.  She looked at me incredulously.

After she demonstrated, I saw that she was doing a pas de bas not a polka.

I have similar comments about waltz.  There are many waltz varients if one
does vintage dancing, including 2/4 and 5/4, which way the couple faces,
etc.  boston (slow waltz) box steps, Viennese, etc.  A waltz is step, step
close, not step close step. A running watlz is step, step step.

There...Now I have started a new thread of 2bits worth.

I grew up on the south side of Chicago. A *whole* lot of people there knew
how to polka, and did so at every opportunity. The same, I gather, in
Michigan's Upper Peninsula. And Pittsburgh. And plenty of other places where
folks from Eastern Europe and Scandinavia immigrated. The folks who do this
in the bars don't usually join ECD groups, though.

I just came home from Fae's much-debated "What I learned on my vacation"
dance, and it was great.  It is possible for a group of experienced dancers
to spend almost the whole evening doing dances new to most of them and have
a wonderful time (it clearly helps to have great music).  Even with my
clumsy & inexperienced calling people were obviously enjoying "Perpetual
Motion" a lot and there were very few trouble spots. I think it shows that
some things work well in particular dance communities that wouldn't work at
all in others. Another lesson may be that since even many experienced
dancers have poor memories for individual dances, it may matter less that
dances are unfamiliar than some of us expect because we ourselves always
remember whether we've done a dance before.  (Of course if people couldn't
have fun doing all unfamiliar dances, they would never have fun at a first
dance...)

You're right that the listserv *adds* a reply-to address to the header; but
it does not necessarily *remove* the sender's name.  (Maybe it's being
concealed by your software?)  Here is the header of your message as it came

It's the sender's address that appears in my in-box as the sender.[1] If I
wanted to reply privately, I could reply to the sender without cutting and
pasting, simply by rejecting the software's offer to direct my reply to the
reply-to address.

(Unfortunately, I don't think the email software I'm using - Pine - is
widely available to individuals.  But perhaps there are other programs that
behave equally helpfully?)

I'm in favor of reply-to-list as the default for this discussion list. The
suggestion (sorry, I forget who made it) of an occasional reminder from the
listowner about this sounds reasonable if Alan is willing.

[1] It's clear that this is the case for several people who have
inadvertently replied on-list because they didn't see the "To" or "Reply-to"
header.

Susan,

I usually process 99% my email from home, on my Windows PC, using Microsoft
Outlook.  Full headers are available to me.

I was trying to explain to Tom that the reason he wasn't seeing a difference
between "reply" and "reply-to-all" was because the headers were already
munged to make Reply go to the list.  That's what the Reply-to Header that
you quoted does.

I have access to pine for email only with my University accounts, and I have
access to my university accounts and my non-university accounts together
under Outlook, which is why I'm outlook-centric and not pine-centric.

In my experience as an email system administrator, the munging actually
supplants the "reply-to" header that used to be populated with the email
address of the sender... And replaces it with a "reply-to" header that is
populated with the email addres of the list.

The message itself was shown (by outlook) as coming from "Susan R. Lorand"
in the brief view, and when I open the message it shows
"owner-ecd-AT-ssrl04.slac.stanford.edu; on behalf of; Susan R. Lorand
[srl-AT-Princeton.EDU]".

Furthermore, to avoid the risk of being charged with the heinous crime of
"brevity", I attach all the headers I received from your message below my
signature.

JB
