Ben, the zil output file should be recording the button that was pressed.  I 
recently ran an experiment with <zil> <zor> with 7 different possible 
responses (mapped with <vzk +?>) and the output looks like this:

Item 40, 3670.82
 3670.82,+6

don't know why the RT gets recorded twice, but the "+6" is the button that 
the subject pressed.

hopefully that helps

Matthew
