Could this problem be solved in some other way so that you retain the
"wireless" concept of using RF to transfer data.

What is the source of the noise?

At what point is the noise entering the system?

Is it noise or is the environment absorbing or reflecting the transmitted
signal?

Can the signal be scrambled/modulated so that the noise(s) are ignored?

Are you using the correct length antenna for the frequency?

Is this the optimum antenna design for a mobile robot (how about a miniature
Yagi directional antenna/possibly a dish antenna to focus the transmitted
and reception of the signal?????)

The best source for RF stuff would be the newsgroups that pertain to Amateur
Radio (HAM radio). One in particular deals with HF (high frequency RF 150 hz
to 30 khz) an area that is highly susceptible to noise due to the type of
modulation that is currently and widely used ---- AM (Amplitude Modulation).

HAMs have also been experimenting with transmitting/receiving digital
information via RF for some time now. I'm sure they've got some great ideas
on sending and receiving. This is the area of packet radio. Someone may have
a an idea on how to modulate the signal so you can isolate it from most
noises. I'm sure there is an answer here for u since these guys exchange
data on a global scale.....from their cars, ham shacks, attics, and porches
using 5 watt handheld transceivers pointed at amateur radio satellites.
Think of the noise they have to deal with.

The wattage (power) being transmitted by the transmitter will "probably"
blow the receiver. Next to this, it's an experiement on developing a circuit
that can decrease the voltage and or current from the transmitter, if you
are intent on a direct connection.

Well, I hope this is helpful.

KC8MPS,

Jose
