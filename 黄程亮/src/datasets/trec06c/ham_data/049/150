Howdy 2,

My other question is about the smooth pwm routines which I haven't been able
to re-produce either. Is there a C example out there somewhere (or other
FAQs / documentation ? I used the McManis code (which I start to understand)
to create an eight-step driver and like to get more precission and control
over the motors.

Thanks,
Jaron Paludanus
