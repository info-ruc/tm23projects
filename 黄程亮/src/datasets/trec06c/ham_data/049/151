Howdy,

Has anybody succeeded in porting the libraries for the expansion board to
another compiler? My lack of understanding and the absence of explanatory
documentation (or can't I find it ...) make that my progress is very slow.

If anybody can explain or knows documentation to find on "how" to recreate
the drivers to address the mux and servos from within (ANSI) C or has code
snippets containing info please point me to it. Also more conceptual
information on the workings of those parts would be great ...

Thanks,
Jaron Paludanus
