Hi Folks,
  I'm sitting here with my Handyboard, a Theramin, and an almost complete
Fatman (midi controlled analog synth) that I want to interconnect together.
The first problem I am trying to solve how to connect the HB as a midi
controller. I've gotten the MIDI code from Interactive Art with the HB
<http://music.dartmouth.edu/~colby/hb.html>. While it mentions that you can
connect the HB directly to Midi it doesn't provide a design for the
connector to do so.
  I hopped on over to another link I had around for use with my PIC that
shows how to connect a PIC directly to Midi
<http://www.audiomulch.com/midipic/>. For final reference I checked out the
Midi Fanatics Brainwashing Center <http://www.borg.com/~jglatt/> in case I
missed anything and I still can't quite figure it out.

 The gist of what I was going to do:
 * Use two connectors, one phone jack (RJ11) to get to the serial info to
hook up to the midi connector.
* Hook up TxD to Pin 5 on the Midi connector.
* Hook up pin 4 on the midi connector to ground.
[Pins 1,2, and 3, are unused on Midi In on the FatMan].

Should this do it and not fry anything? Will the 68HC11 be able to source
enough extra current to run the optoisolator on the other end of the Midi
link?

On a similar note how would I go about hooking up the control voltage
outputs from the Theramax to the HB. It seems I would tie the grounds of the
HB and the Theramin together. Then place a resistor in series with the CV
such that the voltage divider formed by it and the 47K resistor on the board
was negligible. Any sugesstions for the size of this resistor?

Thanks for all your help!
