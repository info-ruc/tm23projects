One of the best ways I have found to find parts on the web is with a program called PARTMINER V.3
You can find it at:
http://www.partminer.com/Pm_HomePage/index.asp

You put in what you are looking for and the program looks at multiple sites and pulls up the data sheet if available. A very good little program. It works with you browser.
Then you can see who has what and how much. 
Good luck.
