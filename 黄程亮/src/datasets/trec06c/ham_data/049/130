It's very simple: The motors aren't connected to +DC and ground, but
rather to a complicated circuit (the L293D) which switchs the motor
terminals to EITHER dc or ground, depending on the direction of the
motor. It acomplishes this thru the use of a transistor bridge (2 for
each terminal of the motor, 1 for each direction).

So, you would need 4 transistors for each motor, connected to DC and
ground (ugh!).
