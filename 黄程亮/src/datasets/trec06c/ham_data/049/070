I'm not to clear on what you are describing here.  Generally speaking I would 
say yes, you can slap a piece of coax in without too much loss of function.  
But you really need to know what type of antenna your feeding, the radio's 
frequency, the impedance expected at the terminal by the 
transmitter/receiver.  If you wish to read up on it, I suggest going to your 
local library and finding a book call "The 19xx ARRL Handbook for radio 
amateurs" (where xx is the year of your choice).  This book gives you enough 
information to design your own radios and antennas.
    If the antennas in questions are just "rubber ducks" (short whip 
antennas), I wouldn't worry too much about the feeding system.  Just about 
any antenna system is better than a rubber duck.  The ones that I have seen 
are just resistors with slightly longer than normal feed lines.  Yet these 
tiny devices can be found on a large number of radios communicating over long 
distances.

Hope this helps,
Pherd
