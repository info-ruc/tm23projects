I have both a miniboard and a Handy board. I have recently purchased some Sharp 40mhz IR detectors to use with these boards. I have very little knowledge of electronics and don't know how to flash the IR LED at a rate that the detectors will need. My understanding is that I can do this at least two different ways. One way would be to use the controller boards to flash the LEDs using software. The other way would be to construct a circuit to flash the LEDs and have the controllers turn them on and off as needed. I would like to do the later. Can anyone point me to an easy to build circuit that wil do the later? I did see a circuit on a web page that used a 74HC04 and a few resistors to do this, but I had a hard time reading the diagram. Any help would be great.


Thanks
