OH I see!

    Well, in that case, yes there are some advantages to using coax.  Also a 
single wire will enhance your "reception" and my be the easiest thing to try. 
 You might want to avoid "Coiling" the unused wire in your system as this 
would increase the inductance.  (This can be handy at time.  Hams coil their 
coax at the base of the tower just after a ground rod as a cheap lightning 
arrestor.  But the gas traps work better.)  
    Coax would give you the best signal to noise ration, but as it is 
transmission line, will not suffer the high losses (1/d^2) of radiation.  You 
will need to compensate for this by attenuating the signal at some point.  
Receivers are set up to detect signals in the microvolt range.  Transmitters 
run several volts (depending on the power).  Most transmitters and receivers 
assume an antenna impedance of 50 ohms.  Lets assume your receiver wants 5 
uV(microvolt) and the transmitter is sending 5V. (To get the actual voltage, 
look at the power output on the spec sheet, multiply by 50 ohms and take the 
square root of the product.)  We can attenuate the signal by assuming a 50 
ohm input to the receiver and simply adding a series resistor to the center 
conductor of the coax.  So:

Receiver voltage =  (Receiver impedance / Series Impedance) * Transmitter 
voltage

5uV = (50/X) * 5V  -> X = 1Mohm

Substitute your own numbers, but a 1 MegOhm resistor should keep the smoke 
from coming out of the chips.

Hope this helps,
Pherd
