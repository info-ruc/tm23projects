Well, guess what?  After posting a question on the crossgcc list and
also posting my announcement on Freshmeat, along comes someone with a
pointer to what appears to be a newer, better version of the GCC
compiler for HC11 (based on the EGCS compiler).

This guy uses the GNU toolchain, and looks like he has floating
point and the whole bit.  Just thought you guys would like to know.

I added a pointer to it from my home page also.  For those who don't
know, the EGCS source tree became the official GCC source tree, so
gcc-2.9.5 IS EGCS.
