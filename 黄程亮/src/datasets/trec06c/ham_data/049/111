Hello all,

I have a completed robot for sale that contains the following components:

1 Handy Board and interface board with battery pack and charger(Patrick Hui
and Radio Shack for batt and chgr)

1 Expansion Board (Gleason)

2 12-24v gearhead motors modified to provide faster output by removing one
gear in power train (Acroname surplus item). Removed gears will be included,
the mod is reversible.

2 Four inch inflatable tires as purchased from a local R/C aircraft store.
Smooth tread and include an adapter fashioned from a surplus aluminum gear
that mounts directly to gearmotors.

2 Hamatsu IR detectors for use as wheel encoders. I think I have 2 more that
I didn't actually use on the 'bot.

2 R/C aircraft servos

1 Polaroid 6500 sonar ranging module and sender

1 Motion sensor purchased from Acroname (Eltec somthing or other check thier
web site)

1 Sharp IR ranging sensor GP2D02

1 Lynxmotion IR object detector kit assembled and working

2 Photo sensors

4 National Semiconductor LMD18200 (I think) - not used on 'bot

2 12v Radio Shack camcorder batteries for motor power

Description of robot:

Base constructed out of 1/8" Lynxmotion yellow sheet stock approx the size
of a 8 1/2" x 11" sheet of paper. Rounded corners. Dual motor drive with
trailing caster (R/C aircraft tail wheel 1 1/2" dia.). Sonar and GP2D02
mounted on pan/tilt mechanism on front right ("passenger" side in the U.S.)
with IR object detector mounted on top surface of base centerd on the front
of the 'bot. The motion sensor cone is position a little farther back from
the pan/tilt ranging head and on the left side of the 'bot, not blocked by
the ranging head.

The base was constructed using a CAD drawing overlaid on the sheet stock and
cut with a band saw. The wheels are recessed within the profile of the 'bot
as you look down from directly above but they do break the outline by about
1/4". The motor mounts are made of the same sheet material as is the
pan/tilt framework and are very sturdy. The servos are mounted side by side
behind the IR object detector with the pan/tilt frame mounted directly on
the right one for the "pan" movement (+90deg  to -90 deg), the left one
operates a flexible pushrod (from hobby store) that allows up and down
movement (-15deg down to about +35deg up). The HBoard battery is mounted
directly on the front underside of the base. One of the camcorder batteries
is mounted between the front wheels and the caster mount with the second
mounted on top of the base directly behind the HBoard and Expansion board.
The "brains" are mounted with standoffs on the centerline of the top surface
of the base and behind the drive wheels. The sonar module is mounted on the
top of the base and to the right and under the the "brains".

Everything works and operates and it currently has programs loaded that will
allow it to do simple wall following and photo avoidance or seeking. I do
still have mild difficulty getting consistent readings from sonar sensor.
The wheel encoders give 64 tic per revolution resolution using a paper
stripe disc mounted directly to the inside of the wheels. All related
software (registered version) is included. The only physical modification is
to the h-bridge motor drivers and is reversible. I double stacked the
existing chips with two more chips and fed in the two camcorder batteries. I
don't remember the part numbers but the existing ones are the kind that came
with the Patrick Hui board and the ones on top are the higher capacity kind
that come with the Gleason board and I do not have problems with
overheating. I think I even have one extra that would go with it.

As it is, the robot would be good for someone who just wants to program and
doesn't want to fiddle with building. There is still room to mount
additional sensors and electronics. It could use some bump sensors, for
instance. It was built in a workmanlike manner and looks good without a buch
of wires sticking out all over the place.

I am selling it due to lack of time (I have a new son). I estimate that I
have at least $650.00 in the parts that are either on it or that I will
include with it.

Please contact me if you are interested.

Thank you,

Bob Kelly
