Note that I haven't tried this, and chances are it won't work, but
the idea struck me anyway (ouch!):

With the compiler patches for gcc-2.9.5, there are patches for
the GDB debugger to add debugging, disassembly, and emulation
capabilities for the HC11.

While the emulation capabilities may not be enough to run IC, who
knows... they just might.

Perhaps you could even apply the patches to the Cygwin tools and get
a development system running this way off of Windows.  I use Linux
myself.
