I am having trouble downloading IC to the Handy Board.
The pcode_hb.s19 file seems to be downloade properly and the
leds on the handy board and the Interface board do flicker while
communicating.
But after the pc_codehb.s19 file download is complete, and when I 
switch off and on the Handy board, I dont hear any beeps and I 
dont see the IC prompts on the LCD screen. 
When I try to run IC , I get the 
Error Synchronizing with the board message. 

Anybody been through this problem before ?


thanks
