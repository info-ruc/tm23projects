Subject: 74LS instead of HC chips in the handyboard

Question. After having ruined more than once a couple of chips, i decided to 
purchase a 74LS373 chip instead of the HC373. I already replaced the HC04 
and found no apparent problems. But here i'm talking about the memory latch.

Is this OK, provided i don't replace any other chips in the HandyBoard?

Thanks!
