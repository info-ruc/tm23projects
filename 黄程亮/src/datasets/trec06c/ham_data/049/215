Subject: LCD print formating problem
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I connected a real time clock to my Handy Board and wrote a small
routine that displays the time and date on the LCD.  
The problem is with the print formatting on the LCD.  

I don't think Interactive C supports double integer digits with zero
fill therefore I don't get the proper display for times such as 00:00:00
what I get is 0:0:0!

Is there a better solution to the above problem than to break down the
seconds, minutes, hours into tens and ones mathematically.

If anybody has come across this problem or has a better solution I would
like to hear it.

Thanks
