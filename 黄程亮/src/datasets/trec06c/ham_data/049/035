It sounds to me like you are intending to use the Plan 9 source, and
that therefore it actually has some value to you.

No, there is no means to obtain the source for free.

However, if you check the [9fans] archive, you will find some email
suggesting a possible release of the current version for free in the
future. However, there is no date, and it might not include anything
other than x86.

delivery. But basically >$350 seems a lot to pay for something I don't
intend to use!
