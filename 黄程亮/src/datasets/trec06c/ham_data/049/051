I noticed something strange happen while testing a file system I
finished implementing.

I imported my file system into another PC terminal on the network.

I then wrote a simple program to run on the remote PC to read raw bytes
from the imported files system, but forgot to close the file.

Not thinking much about it, I ran to program 3 times, got the info I
needed then rebooted both machines.
(the hosting machine and the importing machine).

When I rebooted both computers I got 3 panic messages on the boot
screens that happened while running my lib/profile. Both systems
appeared to hang.

I then logged in as another user on one of the PCs, and deleted my test
program. This appeared to get everyone booting again. The other hanging
PC (That I did NOT log into as another user), resumed its boot, ignoring
the errors. When I checked the /proc and also did a ps I saw
descriptions for the 3 executions of the test program. It was listed as
broken.

Question:

What was going on here, I am just curious. Did Plan 9 try and restore a
connection and execution of my test program ?

Did deleting it cause Plan9 to give up on it. Is this some kind of
post-mortem feature ?


Thanks
