I am in the process of assembling a Handy Board. I have reached the point 
where the memory + support chips  have been added to the Handy board.
At this point , I am having some problems running the test procedures for
this
stage.  

I am not able to download IC to the Handy Board.

The pcode_hb.s19 file seems to be download properly and the
'leds' on the handy board and the Interface board do flicker while
communicating.

But after the pc_codehb.s19 file download is complete, and when I 
switch off and on the Handy board, I dont hear any beeps and I 
dont see the IC prompts on the LCD screen. I do see the first line of the
LCD all lit up. 

When I try to run IC , I get the 

"Error Synchronizing with the board" message. 

I tried to download pcode a number of times but when I reach the IC download
stage, I get the same error message. 

The memory and support chips all seem to get power OK. The 6811 is a good
chip
since I have used the same chip on a Rug Warrior board. 


Anybody been through this problem before ?


thanks
