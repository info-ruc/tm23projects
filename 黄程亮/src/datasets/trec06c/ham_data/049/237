Greetings All!
        I recently had some power supply problems with my handy board
during which the inductor burnt out.  I fixed this problem, presumably-
I replaced the 5V voltage regulator, the inductor, the 74hc04, and the
74hc132.  I plugged the LCD back into the Handy Board, and turned it on,
and it gave me the 16 blocks across the top that it is supposed to.  I
set the config register and loaded the pcode, which it didn't seem to
have any problems doing.  But when I turned it on, it beeped once, but
it didn't give me the Interactive C v.2.81  like it is supposed to.  I
loaded IC, and that worked, but when I tried to send it a printf command
it gave me the 16 blocks across the top instead of  "Hello World".    Is
there something that I still need to replace?  Could the LCD be
damaged?   Is it a memory thing?   Thank you very much.
