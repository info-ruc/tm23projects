One clarification:  I haven't ported anything to the expansion board
for GCC because I don't own an exansion board.  Now if someone wants to
make a donation, I'm sure some code could be worked out...   ;-)

One could always look at the source code to figure out how things work,
then create your own expansion board library.  That method always seems
to work for me.
