Subject: Noise on the handy board
Mime-Version: 1.0

Fred and handyboard experts,

I have assembled two handyboards and I am now helping 15 other people build theirs at San Jose State University.
I found a problem on the first two I build that I belive causes the Sharp GP2D02 not to work. 
The school had one HB built by Gleason that we loaded the Sharp GP2D02 program on it worked fine. When I loaded the same code on my two boards I was unable to get any values except for zero. I scoped out both boards at the diode pin and the other input pin for the GP2D02 sensor and found a lot of noise on the one I build compared to the Gleason unit.
 I have the J.R. Miller inductor and the 10 volt 470 cap on the system, the other caps are rated at 16 volts, but at the right value I believe, surplus parts. The only deviation on my system is the use of Nickel Metel Hydride batteries, 9.6 volts 1.2 Amps. 

HELP!!!

How is the noise on the boards handled?
Have you ever heard of this problem?
What did I do wrong? 

I need to get this solved before I have 15 more boards that do not work right.
Any help at this point would be very appreciated.
