Well I have got an expansion board and started some porting
a week ago. So fare I have a working digital_out.o, servo.o and
gp2d02.o. All is a bit beta and needs some testing. 
I had a look at the code of Fred Martin (for the library) and 
Barry Brouillette (for the Sharp GP2D02 infrared ranging unit)
and was able to use it almost as it was.
I have no use for the LEGO and analog inputs, but should be no major
problem. 

If anybody is interested in the code and in doing some testing...

Thomas.
