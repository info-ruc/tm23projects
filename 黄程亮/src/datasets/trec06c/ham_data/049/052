You know, I think its time to crash for the night, I am definitely
fried-

I didn't explicitly call my program from termrc or lib

BUT !

termrc DOES call the plan 9 test utility!  (I forgot about that one!)

I happened to name my program test,  so when termrc was trying to run it
must have been calling my version of test. (It appears before the system
version in my namespace since it is in my home directory).



Thanks
