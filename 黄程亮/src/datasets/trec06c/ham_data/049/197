None...
I have tried several versions, then finally
come to the http://www.physik.tu-berlin.de/ site.
Search on this site (with the search form included)
returned four pages of Berkant Goeksel </~bgoeksel/>, 
but every one of them gives an error (either "not found",
or "you dont't have permission to access...").

Ask Parker, who sent this link to the list...

I have tried the link again myself and find it non-functional. I have
appended most of the relevant links on the page below:


GRAVITATIONAL ENGINEERING PAGE http://home.att.net/~kfbrown/

A possibility of emission of high frequency gravitational radiation from
d-wave to s-wave type superconductor junctions
http://alpha.science.unitn.it/~fontana/spsj.html

General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology, abstract
gr-qc/9512027 http://xxx.lanl.gov/abs/gr-qc?9512027


The two most interesting papers were unfortunately on the German site. They
were from Petkov and presented some rather fascinating treatments of the
origin of mass and inertia. I have both pdf files downloaded to my system,
if anyone wants copies please email me directly and I will forward them -
Steve would not like me sending attachments of this size through his mail
server <G>.
