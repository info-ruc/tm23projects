Hi all,

Hydrogen could be used for fusion, but its storage is a bit awkward. New
technologies may make this easier:

FROM: Vince Stricherz, 205-543-2580, vinces@u.washington.edu

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Aug. 16, 1999

New spacecraft propulsion method could be out of this solar system

It sounds like a "droid" straight out of Star Wars. That's not a coincidence
because a new propulsion system dubbed M2P2 can greatly boost spacecraft
speeds, perhaps to 10 times the velocity of the space shuttle, University of
Washington scientists believe.

NASA's Institute for Advanced Concepts last week awarded a two-year,
$500,000 grant to a UW team headed by geophysicist Robert Winglee to
continue research on Mini-Magnetospheric Plasma Propulsion. If laboratory
work and tests in space succeed, he hopes in 10 years to launch an
M2P2-equipped spacecraft that would become the first from Earth to
leave the Solar System.

That would be quite a feat, considering the craft would have to overtake
Voyager I, launched in 1977 and now about 6.8 billion miles away but still
within the solar system.

Winglee, an associate geophysics professor, has been working on M2P2 the
last nine months with geophysics professor George Parks and John Slough,
a research associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics. They are
developing a prototype and are preparing for tests in the UW's Redmond
Plasma Physics Laboratory.

Their system would use a plasma chamber about the size of a large pickle
jar, perhaps 10 inches by 10 inches, attached to a spacecraft. Solar cells
and solenoid coils would power the creation of a dense magnetized plasma,
or ionized gas, that would inflate an electromagnetic field 10 to 12 miles
in radius around the spacecraft. The field would interact with and be
dragged by the solar wind.

Creating the field would be akin to raising a giant sail and harnessing the
solar wind, which moves at 780,000 to 1.8 million miles an hour -- or
"here to Washington, D.C., in 10 seconds," Winglee said. There is enough
power in the solar wind to move a 300-pound spacecraft at speeds up to
180,000 miles per hour or 4.3 million miles a day. By contrast, the space
shuttle travels at about 18,000 miles per hour or 430,000 miles a day.

At such speeds, an M2P2-equipped spacecraft launched today could
overtake Voyager I within eight years, despite Voyager's 22-year head
start.

The idea for M2P2 grew from the study of plasma jets forming around
young stars, and was formalized in a $75,000 startup grant from the
NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts.

The system has built-in advantages over solar sails, which are very large,
thin sheets of reflective material such as Mylar that can turn sunlight
into a propelling force. Solar sails are typically many times larger than
the spacecraft they propel and must be deployed mechanically. The M2P2
plasma chamber is far lighter and less bulky than sails. Just a few
kilowatts of power would support the magnetic field and only about
100 pounds of additional propellant would be required. Adding the device
to a spacecraft might cost $1 million, but it would provide substantial
cost savings for the overall mission and would provide easier access to
the planets and beyond, Winglee said.

M2P2 could be a major advancement in space travel, but it might be too
tame for two generations that have grown up with science-fiction
adventures such as Star Trek and Star Wars.

"It's amazing how many people say, 'That's not fast enough,'" Winglee said.
"People want to go to warp drive so they can get to the next solar system."

However, Star Trek's warp drive and the hyperdrive propulsion from Star
Wars, both of which can exceed light speed (186,000 miles per second in
a vacuum), are not possible under the current understanding of the laws
of physics.

For now, at least, plasma propulsion could prove to be the best option
to the science fiction propulsion systems. If tests on M2P2 succeed,
Winglee expects the system's first use in space will come on a mission
NASA already will have scheduled.

"If it works, we'll have some real fun then," he said.

Astronomers Baffled by Space Light
By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
LOS ANGELES (AP) - An arsenal of analytic tools used to figure out the
makeup and distance of stars and galaxies has failed to unlock the secrets
of a mysterious celestial light detected three years ago.
``It's fairly uncommon to stumble on something you don't have a clue
about,'' astronomer S. George Djorgovski said Tuesday. ``It certainly hasn't
happened to me, and I've been doing this for many years.''
Djorgovski was part of the team at Caltech's Palomar Observatory that
detected the object, a pinpoint of light, during a digital survey of the
northern sky.
It remains one of the biggest mysteries uncovered by the Digital Palomar Sky
Survey. The survey, which has collected information on more than 50 million
galaxies and about 2 billion stars, is about two-thirds complete.
Some astronomers believe the object may be a new class of quasar, sources of
energy found in the center of galaxies and believed to be powered by matter
falling into massive black holes.
``This sort of looks a little like them, but not quite. The similarity may
be superficial,'' Djorgovski said. ``That's the closest thing we have found
in all the astronomical literature.''
Usually, astronomers are able to determine an object's composition and
distance by breaking down and analyzing its light. But the mystery object's
spectrum does not fit any of the known patterns, Djorgovski said.
Light also usually holds clues about an object's distance. But because
graphs derived from the light do not match anything known, researchers
aren't sure whether it is inside or outside the Milky Way galaxy.
Repeated photographs revealed no changes in its appearance, ruling out the
possibility that it's an exploding star or supernova.
Djorgovski challenged fellow astronomers to help explain his discovery at
the June meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Chicago. So far,
nobody has produced an adequate explanation.
``We probably have looked at the spectra of several thousand quasars, and
this just doesn't seem to fit,'' said David Crampton, an astronomer with the
National Research Council of Canada. ``It didn't ring any bells.''
The next step will be to analyze the object's infrared spectrum, something
Djorgovski hopes to do next month at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
Researchers also hope that the Hubble Space Telescope might someday be
pointed at the object, which is located in the constellation Serpens.
``But it's very competitive to get time on the Hubble, and they don't like
fishing expeditions,'' he said.

Mysterious light leaves astronomers in the dark

BY JOHN NOBLE WILFORD
New York Times

Every night at their telescopes, astronomers invite the universe to a battle
of wits. Surprise us, they say, with some teasing wink of light, some few
cryptic clues to something unfamiliar and, better yet, an implied challenge
to a cherished theory. In most cases, astronomers boast, we will have it
figured out by dawn.

Now astronomers have an unyielding mystery on their hands, something they
have observed and pondered for three years, a point of light deep in the
northern sky that appears to be like nothing seen before.

This may turn out to be only a curiosity, an odd variation of a familiar
phenomenon, or it may be the first evidence of some unsuspected object with
reverberating theoretical implications -- similar in that sense to the
recent detection of planets around other stars.


No clues from spectrum

The mystery object has so far confounded astronomers because they cannot
decipher the language of its light. Usually, by breaking down the spectrum
of light into its component elements and charting the spikes and dips on a
graph, astronomers can identify and describe an object within minutes.

In this case, however, astronomers are finding nothing familiar about the
light spectrum, a couple of Everests representing emissions from the object
surrounded by lower peaks and broad valleys of heavy elements that blot out
the true contours of the object's nature. They are beginning to sympathize
with archaeologists who sought to read Egyptian hieroglyphics without the
Rosetta Stone.

``I've never seen a spectrum anything like this, and I take spectra for a
living,'' said S. George Djorgovski, an astronomer at the California
Institute of Technology who is the leader of the sky survey that detected
the mystery object.

Whatever the astronomers are seeing, it is probably not a star, at least not
any normal star. The light signature of stars is much simpler than this
object's. Nor is it a distant galaxy, which would have much different light
patterns.

With little evidence and even less conviction, some astronomers speculate
that the object is a quasar, one of the sources of tremendous energies at
the farthest reaches of the universe where the enormous gravitational power
of black holes presumably gobbles up surrounding matter. If it is a quasar,
it must be a rare kind beyond current understanding.

``It doesn't look like a quasar to my eye, but I may be wrong,'' said
Wallace Sargent, a Caltech astronomer and quasar specialist, who is also
director of the Palomar Observatory in Southern California, where the
discovery was made.
So if it is not a normal star, galaxy or strange quasar, astronomers say,
the most intriguing possibility is that the mystery object is announcing the
existence of an entirely new cosmic phenomenon.

``But we must do everything to rule out the known before we postulate that
we have discovered something really and truly new,'' Djorgovski said.


New discoveries ahead

Mystification is likely to be a more common experience in astronomy as more
powerful telescopes and instruments with improved sensitivity are used for
systematic probes deeper into the universe and over broader stretches of
sky.
Several comprehensive sky surveys under way or just beginning are expected
to discover many rare or even previously unknown types of astronomical
objects and forces.
Exploring the entire northern sky in different color filters, for example,
the Digital Palomar Sky Survey, now nearing completion, has collected data
on more than 50 million galaxies and about 2 billion stars. The census has
identified more than 70 quasars at such great distances that they are being
seen at a time when the universe was less than 10 percent of its present
age.

One surprising discovery was a star like light several hundred times
brighter than the galaxy with which it was associated. Astronomers are not
sure, but they suspect they were seeing the after-effects of a gamma-ray
burst, the most powerful events in the universe today.
First detected in the 1960s, gamma-ray bursts are examples of an
astronomical mystery that is only now being solved.


Isolating rare points

For the survey, astronomers devised computer programs to sift through
processed photographs for star like objects, then distinguish the stars from
galaxies and isolate rare points of light that are not immediately
recognizable. This was how the new mystery object showed up.

Djorgovski and his team examined the object's light spectrum. Some of the
lines of emissions, especially the two Everest spikes, looked too sharp to
be from a quasar. They combed the star catalogs and published research
papers, but found nothing like it.

A search in the archives of X-ray and infrared surveys failed to show
anything in those wavelengths at the location where the object's visible
light was detected.

``This was the first one of something new, and a complete mystery to us,''
Djorgovski said.
