Hi All,

	Since I am not expert in electronics, I have a question regarding
the use of a transistor or thyristor. If I use a power source of say 20V
to power one of those high Amp DC motors, why can't I introduce transistor
or thyristor between one of the terminals of the motor and power source
and use the motor outputs of HB to fire the thyristor/transistor?

	I was reading the FAQs at
http://lcs.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el/projects/handy-board/faq/index.html#mpwrplug
on "How can I use motors other than 9 volts with the Handy Board?" and I
want to know why my method will or will not work?

Thanks,
-Satish.
