I have just been alerted to the rather worrying article below.  Does anyone
have any comments on this or further information?

No.2, pp.322-328 

The time in which to press a key and the video retrace interval were
measured under various conditions of MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 3.11,
Windows 95, and Windows NT 4.0 Workstation. All the measurements were
obtained with the same program running on a single Pentium 300 computer. In
all, samples of 1,000 timing measurements were obtained in each of 96
different conditions. Standard deviations of the times ranged from about
0.0006 msec under DOS 6.22 to almost 40 msec under Windows 3.11,
representing an increase in timing error of up to 6,000,000% Researchers
requiring millisecond timing accuracy are recommended to use DOS only.
