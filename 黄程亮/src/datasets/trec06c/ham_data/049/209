  You can check out the testmodes in DMDX, one of them displays the
latencies in the millsecond callback, it is these latencies that are used
to poll PIO12 and joystick switches, typical values on my machines are
0..2ms with the odd 3..5ms value representing about 0.00001% of the values.
 In the Input section of the DMDX help file are a number of timings of
keyboards, variations are 2..3ms on a good device and worse with shoddy
devices.  Personally I don't see how you can get 0.0006ms deviation with a
keyboard _ever_, the device has an embedded processor in it that scans the
keyboard 5 keys at a time and when it finds a key it sends it to the PC, I
can't imagine any keyboard is polled at 1/0.0000006Hz, 1/0.006Hz maybe...
