TO ANYONE:

IF I WERE TO PURCHASE AN UNASSEMBLED HANDYBOARD OR EXTENTION BOARD,
WOULD IT BE STRAIGHT FOWARD AND RELATIVELY EASY TO ASSEMBLE IT? ANY
SUGGESTIONS ANYONE? ANY WISE ADVICES?? WHAT KIND OF TOOLS WOULD I NEED?
WOULD A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT BE ABLE TO DO IT? IS IT EASY WHEN FOLLOWING
THE ASSEMBLY MANUAL??

HELP
