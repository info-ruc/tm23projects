Hi Paul - - -
Yes, a high school student should be able to assemble a HandyBoard IF:
1. You are VERY good at exactly following instructions.  One mistake
   could easily make you lose your entire investment!
2. You have a LOT of experience assembling and soldering electronic
   kits with very small, closely spaced components.  One mistake could
   easily make you lose your entire investment!

I've had a HandyBoard for about a year now, and just this past weekend
ordered a second unit ... both from Gleason Research ... and I've been
doing electronics for many years. ==> http://www.gleasonresearch.com/

Please read the following pages carefully before deciding how to go:
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/hardware/assembly.html
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/howtoget/vendors.html
http://el.www.media.mit.edu/projects/handy-board/howtoget/cmponent.html

If I were you, I would only consider assembling a HB if I felt very
confident that I fully met the two experience requirements listed
above, AND had a very experienced microcontroller technician available
to give lots of assistance in trouble shooting in the likely event that
there is a problem.

I understand that Patrick Hui ships a very well produced board at a
good price.   ==>  http://home.hkstar.com/~huip/

Good luck and have fun,
