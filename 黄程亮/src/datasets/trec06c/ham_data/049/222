Have you used the correct formating strings.

Here's what I mean





main()

{

	int a = 1, b = 0;



	printf("a = %d, b = %d\n", a, b);

	printf("a = %2.2d, b = %2.2d\n", a, b);

}



The output would look something like this....



a = 1, b = 0

a = 01, b = 00 





Hope this help....



Russ

Subject: LCD print formating problem


I connected a real time clock to my Handy Board and wrote a small

routine that displays the time and date on the LCD.  

The problem is with the print formatting on the LCD.  



I don't think Interactive C supports double integer digits with zero

fill therefore I don't get the proper display for times such as 00:00:00

what I get is 0:0:0!



Is there a better solution to the above problem than to break down the

seconds, minutes, hours into tens and ones mathematically.



If anybody has come across this problem or has a better solution I would

like to hear it.



Thanks
