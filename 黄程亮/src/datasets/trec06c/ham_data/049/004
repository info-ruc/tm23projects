See the Polaroid sonar code (from the HB web site) for an example of how to measure timing signals on the TIC3 channel.  You initialize with:

	bit_set( 0x1009, 0x30 );                /* ddrd */
	bit_set( 0x1021, 1 );                   /* at tctl2, */
	bit_clear( 0x1021, 2 );                 /* set tic3 for rising edge */

then start timing with:

	poke( 0x1023, 1 );                      /* clear tic3 flag */
	start_time = peekword( 0x100E );        /* capture start time */

then do something else for a while, and finish with:

	return peekword( 0x1014 ) - start_time;	/* tic3 has time of echo */

I confess I really don't understand it (especially, what's the difference between peekword(0x100E) and peekword(0x1014) ???) but it seems to work.
