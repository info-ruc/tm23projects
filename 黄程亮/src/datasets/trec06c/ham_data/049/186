No.  The serial board also includes the Maxim MAX232 chip which
converts the 0-5V levels on the 68hc11 SCI port to the +/- 12V levels
required by the RS-232 serial standard.

You can (sometimes) build a quick and dirty TTL to RS-232 converter
with pullup resistors/diodes, but you're better off with a proper
level converter.

The MAX232 chip uses those capacitors on the serial board to help
generate +/- 12V from the 5v power supply.  If you're using a PC power
supply with +/- 12V provided, you can use level-shifting chips that
are much cheaper and do not require capacitors---the Motorola
1488/1489 pair, or the Motorola 145406.

A 145406 can be wired to 5v,gnd,TX,RX,+12,-12 and acts as a level
converter with no other components---I have one wire-wrapped onto a
header on a test rig right here.

Data for all the above are available from Maxim's and Motorola's
respective WWW sites.
