Is it possible to replace the serial interface board with a straight
RJ11 to  DB 9 connector if i don't care about charging the battery.  I
have taken the battery out of my project and am powering the HB from a
computer power supply.  I what to get rid of the serial interface board
to cut costs. Any suggestions?
