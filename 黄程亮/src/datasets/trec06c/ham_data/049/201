Yet another announcement:

	http://www.eskimo.com/~archer
or	ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/u/a/archer

contains:

	NOTES.gcc295
and:	gcc-2.95-hc11-19990811.diffs.gz

files.  Between Stephan Carrez' web pages (first link above)
and my NOTES file, you too can get an HC11 GNU toolchain working
with the latest GNU compiler.  Newlib doesn't compile, but the
compiler, assembler, linker, and debugger are all working, and
the simulator works also.

99.99999% of the credit for this goes to Stephan.  I did about
15 minutes worth of work in order to make it work with the latest
compiler.  Well, that was the amount of real work I accomplished
after several hours of chasing dead-ends anyway...

BTW:  If anyone has an E-mail address for Stephan, I'd like to get
in contact with him.  I pieced together an address from his web
address, but haven't heard from him yet.

Print out Stephan Carrez's web pages, then mark them up from my
NOTES file.  Download most of the executables from Stephan's links,
two files from my site, and gcc-core-2.95.tar.gz from GNU download
sites (try egcs.cygnus.com).

Works for me on SuSE Linux 6.1 and 5.3.  I'll try it on Redhat
Linux 5.2 and 6.0 next.
