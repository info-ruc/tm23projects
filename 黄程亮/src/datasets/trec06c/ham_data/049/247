Hello all, got a bit of a problem,

I'm developing a robotics project for grade school kids, and I want them
to be able to program the bot. Instead of teaching them all IC (which
seems unlikely), I decided to try to write a little pseudo-code
interpreter ("Yeah, with all that spare time you've got," says my wife).
This would allow the kids to use easily understandable commands to write
the program, and they would be able to compile it themselves through the
interpreter, which would through its output right to the IC compiler (of
course, I haven't worked out the details yet). I'm thinking of something
like Ousterhout's TCL scripting language, which is like an easier way to
access and understand C programming commands.

Does anybody have a file of all of the public functions available in IC
(V. 2.860 or similiar)? I don't have a Handy Board right now, and
picking them all out of the code might cause me to miss some and add
ones that don't exist. (If there's a way to run IC on my box without a
board connected to the serial port, I'd do it). I need to know which
functions are public in order to start. I imagine I'll just do a simple
trial with the currently available functions and a few other things,
just to see if it's worth it trying to develop a serious interpreter.
The main functions in IC are already pretty easy, but if we are to do
anything more complicated than that, it may get a bit hairy for 7th and
8th graders.
