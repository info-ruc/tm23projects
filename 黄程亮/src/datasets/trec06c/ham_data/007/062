Hmmm, using Pine you couldn't period. It won't "search". If you are looking
for an email address locally, i.e. on campus, there may be other means to
accomplish that.
What you could do though, is  with a web browser (using lynx if you want to
stay within a UNIX environment) is go to http://www.bigfoot.com, or
http://www.switchboard.com  and search for the person's email address by
their name, and (if you know) state.
Depending on how new the person's email address is, you may well be able to
locate it via these search mediums. It is possible that you won't get any
hits if the address is really recent. Try it anyway to see if you get any
results.
Good Luck with your search!
-Colin.
