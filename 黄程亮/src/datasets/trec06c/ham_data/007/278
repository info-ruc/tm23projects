Hi Ruben,

This question has been asked in the past and since my company will eventually
upgrade to AIX 4.2 I saved the replies.

I haven't tried them but here they are:

Reply #1:
	We fixed the problem by loading the sendmail program from AIX 4.1
	in stead of the one included with 4.2

Reply #2:

	I had the same problem, you can fix trhe problem addinng the next line
	to the pine.conf.fixed file in /usr/local/lib directory.
	
	sendmail-path=/usr/sbin/sendmail -t

Have fun,

Sandra
