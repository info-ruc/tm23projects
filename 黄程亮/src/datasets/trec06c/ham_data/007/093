Dear Everett,

thank you for choosing a Microsoft product. We appreciate your information
about MS Exchange's inability to create an RFC-compliant mail format. We are
painfully aware of MS Exchange's shortcomings and are currently working on
an upgrade which will be available shortly. It will be a trimmed version of
MS Exchange and will probably called "mail" for obvious reasons. Since our
R&D team have recently found that the use of a GUI for a mail application in
fact decreases the program's user friendliness, "mail" will be run at the
command line prompt. We envision a simple syntax for the use of "mail", e.g.
"mail foo@bar.com". In order to make it RFC-compliant, it will not support
RTF, HTML, or binary attachments. "mail" will only run under NT, though, but
we will offer a special bundle price for the upgrade kit, which will also
include KerNeL! 98, Fdisk Plus and an improved version of Write
("WriteNow!"). 

Yours truly,

Robin S. Socha M.A.
