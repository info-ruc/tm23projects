Why not? Messages like the OP's have become a common trait here. This is
not a Good Thing (tm). It does not acutally "clutter up the group",
either. This list was supposed to be for technical problems. Well, that
doesn't seem to work. So it might be used as a forum where one can, well,
do some educational stuff.

This is positively incorrect. It's also demeaning my articles. Shame on
you. As a matter of fact, noone here is trying to get even more stoopid
lusers on the net. On the contrary. Colin was making a very valid point
with his article. It's not nice to hop into a mailing list, asking for
information that is at your very fingertips, and it's suicidal to flame
people that offer you free help.

Whiner. And it's *not* condescension you're experiencing here, but mere
frustration, because "we" are becoming a minority - "we" meaning people
that know what they're doing because we did in fact spend some time
reading the documentation. You know, the pine docs are rather well
written, and it doesn't take much time at all to read them. Personally, I
cannot even begin to understand how one could not be able to download a
file when all the necessary steps are explained in the docs _and_ probably
a handout by the young lady's university.

No. If he were, this would be the most boring place on the entire
internet, because there's no input whatsoever from the kind and gentle
people like Ray Cummins and Annelise Undersome.  There is, however, input
from people like Colin. Take it or leave it - it's free and it's up to him
if he want's to flame some luser for violation of the netiquette or not.

> P.S.  I apologize for assuming Colin is male if they are female.

Geez, get a life... PC is dead and we've come to bury it.
