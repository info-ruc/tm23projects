I have various handyboard and i never use the IR ports. So i'm
assembling one handy, and don't put al the components asociated to
that ports. I download anyprogram to that's board and never boot
again!!!! The transmision is o.k. but don't start never to run my
code.  That code run fine in the other board (that's have the IR ports
activate) You say : "well, why don't assembly with the IR port?" i

that question. Anyone can help me???? Thanks a lot!!!!!
