You don't need to, darling. Education is probably lost on you, anyway, since
you haven't learnt to use a real name or a signature.

I'm a consultant for an international risk management agency. Any further

Oh, dear... my, my... Ummm, would you mind if I said that you've got no
clue? I  haven't seen any input from you whatsoever. I've seen a lot from
Colin. Any yes, you did in fact whine. I mean, what's your problem? You
don't seem to know anything, otherwise you'd be helping. You have not been
attacked, yet you feel you need to comment. You don't know Latin, yet you
use the word "objective" without knowing what it acutally says.

I must really suck to be you. Listen, Dearoldmum, there's users and there's
lusers. I would have told a user exactly that. In fact, I did. But Jennifer
turned out to be a whiner. I don't like whiners. People that get a
Terrormail account and Outlook Exploder 99 and come to this list and start
whining that there is no Download Wizard or sm-tnf-converter and the like.
This cannot be it. This is a technical forum (although right now it looks
more like a kindergarten) and we still get a very high noise ratio. Ever
wondered what the rest of the net is like? If I tell someone "go read the
documentation which you can pick up here and which was put there by the same
wonderful people that made pine available for free", I get some 5 f*cked up
lusers like you telling me that RTFM is not a polite/valid/whatever answer.
FUD. I don't need this crap. I help where I can, and that's that. If noone
told people like Jennifer that the way they behave sucks and makes the net
a lousy place to be, they wouldn't even know. I don't think they care, but I
want them at least to know. Go figure.

This is a poor adoption of Goodwin's law, idiot. [x] get a life

I'm neither kind nor gentle. I'm not being paid for that.

My, this is making want to cry. Thank you, I really needed a moral boost
from you. You made my day.

I didn't say "looser". I said "luser". But you don't care, cause you joined
the net in 97 and it's a really cool place where you can hang out and chat
with many people who are all nice and gentle. Of course, I am misguided, of
course my opinion is more than subjective. So? Were you trying to make some
point by stating the obvious, Dearoldlamer?

Hmmm... pico doesn't rot13 regions. Not good. Ok, let's put it this way:
you're a rebel without a clue. You've apparently no idea of the technology
you're using, otherwise I would have seen some input from you. But I
haven't. Still you moan and whine and generally suck - big time. What's you
goal in life? Become King Lackwit I ? People like Colin rule. People like
you suck. Amazing how simple life really is, isn't it?

Partly. The netiquette is about getting along with other people in the
absence of corporal punishment. PC is a communist tool for manipulating
freedom of speech, putting loosers into positions they don't belong, and
demeaning democracy in general. My M.A. thesis was about language
manipulation by totalitarian regimes. PC is Goebbels reborn. No Goodwin
here, just empirical findings. You loose.

Now go away, you're boring.

No, there isn't. If there weren't any, there would be no reason to improve
Linux software.

He's got more than one? What year is it at your place? Here in Germany, it's
1998 and there is no MS "OS" in existence. There's Dos and NT, both of which
are no operating systems by Unix standards.

Finally, some good news here from The Thing without a Name.
