Dear M.M.COLEMAN,

thank you for choosing a Microsoft product. We appreciate your input on MIME
and cool photos. However, we regret to inform you that you need to upgrade
Windows 95 to Windows NT in order to view cool photos in MIME format.
Windows 95 currently only supports blue screen pictures in GPF format.

Yours truly,
