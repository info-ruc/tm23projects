O.K, , I still have a question. I'm working with a handy board and it
use a special mode to talk to a LCD. If i understand , the handy board
need to put the reset vector in the range BFC0 - BFFF. If get the
aplication note for the 711E9 and ,as it say, if i want to use the 12
K OTPROM i need to put the reset vector in the FFC0-FFFF range . I
want to use that that
chip to remove the battery and use that beatifoul option of ROM.
I want to make my code run from my OPTROM and use RAM extern from
8000-AFFF . The aplicattion note say the OPTROM will be  allocatted at
C000-FFFF. My problem actually is to know if i have some possible
solution for the reset vetor location : i really can't believe that
question be a problem . Any help can be great. Thanks in advance.
