You will need a filtering system for that. You didn't state under which OS
you're running pine, but let's presume that you're using some flavour of
u*ix. The first step is to grab a copy of Nancy McGough's filtering mail
faq, the address of which I don't have right now because it was eaten by an
I/O error. It's in the pine FAQ, though, which you will want to read,
anyway.

Then you decide on which filter you want to use (probably procmail) and if
it is installed on your system. Then you go about reading the procmail man
page by saying "man procmail" and "man procmailex". Basically, all you need
is a simple .procmailrc as described in procmailex.

Good luck,
Robin
