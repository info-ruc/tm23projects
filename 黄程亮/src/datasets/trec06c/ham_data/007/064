Subject: using handyboard with vernier ULI
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

Hello from New Mexico
I'm currently teaching a robotics class at the high school level and we
have been exploring the possibility of creating a rover that will
eventually be independent and have enough AI to make decisions that will
get it through the halls of the school, eventually getting to our front
door. This is all on one level and an occasional slight ramp.
So far we have programmed in C++ and with a laptop and the Vernier ULI
interface attached to a laptop, we communicate using a motion
detectorand the computer sends a message to the screen to go a certain
direction (north,east,south ,west) but the person has to do the moving
of the cart.  The Handyboard seemed like a perfect item to take the
place of the laptop. It should do the job of moving around in the halls.
So far my students have succeeded in getting the handyboard to turn on
the motors and respond to small bits of IC code.  We have C++ code in
the laptop and assembly code to communicate with the ULI from the
laptop, and wonder what adjustments we will have to make to create an
independent rover that just uses the handyboard and ULI to do the trick.
thanks for any input you can share.
