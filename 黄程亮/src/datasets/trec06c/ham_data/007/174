Thanks for your reply Vinnie.  

I have been able to add an /etc/mailcap entry for text/HTML to enable HTML
to be shown.  Part of my original problem was that text/plain was not even
being displayed.  This problem has been fixed up also. It appears http
emailers also send a plain version of http. 

An /etc/mailcap entry that worked for me is
text/HTML; lynx -force_html -dump %s; copiousoutput

With regard to piping the output to Lynx, I don't think there is a way
within Lynx for it to accept a html file to be proceesed from standard
input.  However piping the output to a script could set up a file for lynx
to read from and then send output to standard output for the viewer.
