Folks,

Don and Jennifer have been abducted by aliens! They were good people and
deserve better than be replaced by soulless clones. Is there anything I can
do to bring them back, please? Maybe something that will also make pine
filter mail, do threads, yank properly, and forge my from: line - and fix my
hdd? It'd be pretty cool if it would also get me some Coke, pizza and
cigarettes...

TIA,
Robin
