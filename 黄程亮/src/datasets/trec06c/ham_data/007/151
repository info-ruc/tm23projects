Number one...NO This is a mailing list devoted to the discussions =
concerning an email program known as Pine.
That is a major violation of just about every accepted standard of =
etiquette across the Internet today.
Plainly, don't do this...it's spam. It clogs up the network. If youy =
posted to any other newsgroups or mailing lists go back there, re-post =
and say that you're sorry.
Oh, one more thing. If you ever ask someone to put up an image or link =
to your site on theirs, I don't think "how about you put my banner on =
your site" will accomplish your goal. It's rude, it's not a question =
format that elicits any kind response.
Go away and read Netiquette 101.
