I had the same problem. I was never able to get HBDL to set the config
register. I used DL to set it on one board and DLM on another. I used the
information from the HandyBoard technical reference manual to use these
programs.

.pdf

Once the config register was set I was then able to use HBDL. I hope this
helps. Please remember if you use DL or DLM on a Win95 machine, run them in
full screen mode. Neither program will behave correctly if you run them in
a does window. They will appear to work correctly, but you will error
communicating with the board.
