Yo!

My harddisk is still falling apart, XEmacs is still dead, and I just found
that an MUA that doesn't sort mail and display threads *sucks*.  Did I
mention pico? No? Ok, pico *sucks*, too, but my .pinerc... Well...
.pinerc: I/O error

Anyway... I fired up my response to Jennifer's orginal message regardless
of the thread that had already developed, because the responses were
buried among 896 other messages. If, however, I had read the entire thread
beforehand, my reaction would have been entirely different... 

1. Jennifer: you're no fun, and you don't have a clue, either. Please get
   one from a local brainware store. Get yourself a spellchecker, too.

2. Adam et al.: I don't just flame people? I've been on this list for
   some time and I must say that it's getting less and less fun. There are
   almost no technical problems here anymore. Instead, we get newbies
   (which was alright before the People at the Pine Tower decided that
   this list be the forum for technical discussion). Some of these newbies
   just don't have a clue. Now, you might argue that this is what newbies
   are like. NOT! I still maintain that *every* newbie ought to have read
   the netiquette or at least the stuff her ISP had handed out to her. I
   may be old-fashioned, but I will *not* give up easily. If someone comes
   to this forum looking for help, I expect her to maintain a minimum
   standard of politeness. And I don't mean crawling, I mean:

	a) a sensible subject (Jennifer, "HELP!!!" *sucks*, ok?)
	b) a meaningful signature (.signature: I/O error ]:-< )
	c) consulting at the very least pine's online help, because it's
	   good and easy to understand
	d) due diligence in composing one's message - pine offers a spell
	   checker, and the reader can expect a minimum standard of
	   readability. Jennifer: it might take us (nota bene, we're just
  	   users, we're not the pine team, ok?) some time to figure out a
	   solution to your problem and type an answer. It's not asked too
	   much of you to spend a little time to proofread you message, is
	   it?

3. The people who offer free advice deserve a) respect, b) gratefulness,
   c) worship ... ooops! Ok, let's put it this way: when you get a
   helpful answer to your problem, don't start bitching because you get
   mildly toasted for your various violations of the netiquette. Noone
   told you that you suck, we only ridiculed your poor "grammer" and
   spelling. If you cannot live with that, get *commercial* support, ok?

++---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---++

As for life in general: my harddisk is still broken. This sucks. XEmacs
and mutt already went down the drain. For some reason, pine still lives.
Must be Murphy's. pine is not a good mailer for me. Not at all. It doesn't
sort mail, it doesn't do threading, it doesn't score (well, I do, but
that's not the question, is it?) and pico is an abomination. I hereby
request that pico be replaced with an editor that does propper wrapping
and indentation and which can be made aware of vi or Emacs keys. Did I
hear anyone say "joe"?

Hmmm... yeah... broken hdd's suck.  This might be the last message for two
days. Go visit my website while you can, I got this really cool picture of
me and my girlfriend up: <http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/>.

Jennifer, you might want to go here:
<http://franck.pc.uni-koeln.de/~robin/pine.html>. 

If anyone should feel the irrestible urge to send me a reply, my address
is: robin@franck.pc.uni-koeln.de. 

I want my new 9GB drive - now!

Later,
Robin
