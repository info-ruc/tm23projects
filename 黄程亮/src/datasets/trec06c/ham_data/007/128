What operating system are you using? Without this information, there's

Could you please be a little more specific on this one? What did Pine

Again, we need to know your operating system. If you're on a u*ix system,
which one, and which version of pine did you install.

Well, there is ample instructions at the pine website (where you possibly
got your copy from, too). 

Cheers,
