Dear listmember:

I would like to apologize for sending my unprovoked attacks yesterday and
the day prior to Robin and Colin for flaming the newbie.

I said things about them that were unwarrented and definately not
appropriate.  I don't personally know either one of them, and I made
unjustified statements about them.

I also sent those messages to the group without a valid return address, and
that was most rude.  If you were irritated by the post from Speaking Freely,
that was me.

I am sending personal apologies to both of those gentleman immediately.

Sometimes, even people who have been on the net for a while act
inappropriately and I certainly did.  I know that I will attract some flames
for revealing myself, and I deserve them.  Please direct them to me
personally, as I don't want to further impact the list.

I am sorry,

Don Allaire.
