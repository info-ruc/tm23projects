Yes, Andrew. Those I put in manually. I'm lazy.

Indeed, Andrew, indeed. However, I cannot quite follow your logic here. Just
because it can be altered by the user, a sigfile has to comply to the same
standards as any other part of an email. Think of linewidth, headers and
quotation marks, Andrew.

[URL standards]

I don't care, Andrew. I don't care about what lusers do, and what Microsoft
does, and what you think is correct or not. It's the accepted standard, and
it's not a standard made by some sadistic morons, but experienced admins and
the like. Have you ever wondered if there might be a reason *why* those
standards are set?

[URLs spanning more than one line]

Certainly. But some MUAs are aware of URLs, and therefore, you need to
comply to the accepted internet standard for typing URLs. Otherwise, those
URLs don't work and you might as well not use them at all.

No. At least I'm not aware of any. "We" seems to be the other members of
this list. Right, guys?

[random sigs and signatures]

No, Andrew. I was talking about how easy Gnus is to heavily customize in
contrast to pine. Then I said that creating a signature with pine is easy.
Can you understand the difference, Andrew?

Certainly, Andrew, certainly.

[quota problems by sigfiles]

It has features which pine sorely lacks. Since this is a discussion forum, I
feel entitled to comment on these shortcomings from time to time, Andrew.
Any objections from a technical point of view?

Like I did with your setup? No, much too time-consuming, Andrew.

What's objectionable about Yiddish, Andrew? And I'm not quite sure if your
knowledge of Latin would suffice here...

You're most welcome.
