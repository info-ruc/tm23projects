Jennifer and others:

She is right.  If this flaming must go on, why not direct the flames at the
person who deserves them rather than clutter up the group?  I for one have
recieved very helpful feedback from the group. Some people are nicer than
others, but then again, the information provided here is free.

I must say though that Colin of all people on the list seems to try to get
reactions like this.  His attitude is relatively condescending when
responding to people he assumes to be less technically endowed.  If he were
to cool it down a little on his tone, these kinds of people problems
wouldn't be so widespread within the group.  But then of course, maybe Colin
is british and that is just a tad bit of Irony and Sarcasm :)

I will shut my mouth now, I have expended my 2 cents.

P.S.  I apologize for assuming Colin is male if they are female.
