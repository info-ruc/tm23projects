hello,
I tryed to download the pcode_hb.s19 file using DL, When it starts sending
it stops and says "expected 244, received 150, after 144 chars recieved"
I cant seem to get any of the downloaders to work. Im a bit stuck on where
the problems lies as i have traced the bus systems through with a meter and
cheaked for shorts, dry joints etc.
also i was wondering if i had the wrong ram as it has 62256-10 on it and
the mannel says 62256-100, are these the same or is this the problem.

thanks,
