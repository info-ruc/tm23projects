*arg*

afaik pine gives you some hints, for example v(iew) and s(ave) the
pic. Now, for un*x systems you can use something like xv to display
the file. If you have a windows like machine, try one of the paint
tools that come along (or use netscape).

About the use of spell checkers in mails have a look in the thread
'help!!!!!!!!!!' and related subjects.

l8er, norbert.
