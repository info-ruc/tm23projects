Now, the egotists come out.  Never realized that your endless babbling was
considered educational.

Sorry Robin.  You are actually the most condescending of all, and for that
shame on you!  I didn't mean to try to take away your crown and give it to
colin.  Do you have a real job by the way, or is your job to monitor this
list during the times when your hardware isn't falling apart?  Is being a
student all that you do aside from your *contributions* to this list?

>Whiner. And it's *not* condescension you're

Actually Robin, I didn't realize there was a tone of whining in my
statement.   I was just offering objective input, which you felt the
adolecent need to twist.  Aren't you really the whiner?

This point is well put!  Why don't you just reply to people with this rather
than belittle them?

Indeed, and I am sure that you are one who wants to see Sadam Hussain
conquer, because of course, without excitement from dictators like him, the
world would be a dull place.  Maybe you should should try being kind and
gentle, people would react in a much more positive way.  I certainly would
have.


There is, however, input

Your opinion on who is a looser is clearly misguided, and less than
subjective.  As for Mr. Colin, his advice is what it is....Free.  The old
cliche about getting what you pay for has never been more applicable.

Oh Yeah moron, I forgot, being polite is not what you have been complaining
about, it is all about netiquette isn't it.  Of course, there is no
corolation between nettiquette, politeness, and PC, or is there?  You must
be at least 18 years old Robin aren't you?  By the way, this comment was
included because after being on this list for quite some time, it wasn't
until yesterday that I realized you were not a female.  Or should I say
bitch, because that is how you come across at every point you enter group
conversation.

I have a small piece of advice for Robin SWM.   Without endusers, there is
no reason for you.  Without developing software/operating systems that
others can use easily, Bill Gateus will succeed in killing all efforts to
battle his OS's.  Fix the www.enemy.org link you have under your Microsoft
link on your web site.

It's amazing to me that someone who professes their intelligence and
education as you do can act like such a child.

don't expect further posts from me regarding this, as it has already wasted
more time than I have to offer.
