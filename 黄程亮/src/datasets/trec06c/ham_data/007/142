	Robin,
	     Thank you for your help in trying to resolve this
problem.It's difficult to get a response from my server, i'm receive it
from the University here. When i do get a response, they think everyone
should now computer jargon. There have been many helpful responses and i
appreciate it but for every nice response I get alot computer geeks with
very little lives, trying to correct my english. Thank you for your direct
and kind response.
