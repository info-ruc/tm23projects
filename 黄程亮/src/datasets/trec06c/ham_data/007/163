Hi

I get email sent to me written in http.  To read it I save the file
attachments and then read the message surrounded by http.  I couldn't find
a way of setting up mime types to cater for this.  

Is there a quick way to instruct the Pine viewer to display messages it
does not know how to deal with, or is there a way to instruct pine to use
another viewer on command, like lynx?

Regards

John Heenan
