Well, there isn't too much we can do about the line quality of dialups in India.  
However, this should not be too much of a problem if you have a good modem with 
the proper error correction features enabled.  I also do not know what SW/HW you 
are using to connect to VSNL.  I suggest you contact the helpdesk at VSNL for 
assitance in problems with your connection.

Regards,
Ed
