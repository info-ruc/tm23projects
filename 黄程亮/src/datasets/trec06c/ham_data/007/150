Assuming that you gave your correct email address.

I have a few problems with your recent post to the pine-info mailing list

First: it is clear that you aren't using pine. This :

  [NON-Text Body part not included]

tells me that you are sending non-rfc compliant email. For more
information I suggest you go to
http://www.isi.edu/div7/rfc-editor/rfc.html and do an appropriate search.
"mail" strikes me as a good one. (I dont' recall the most recent rfc
number. sorry)

Second : mailing lists are not a good or appropriate place for you to post
your commercial advertisements. it is not appreciated and I can pretty
much assure you you won't get any customers from this list.

Third:  the url that your banner is advertising does not exist. therefore,
you annoyed the subscribers to this list pointlessly, as you really will
not get customers if no one can find you.

Fourth : the software you sell is used for spamming, from the sound of it.
Spam wastes bandwidth and disk space. Spam is killing the news system.
Email spam is inconsiderate, especially to those who have to download
their mail via modem connections and had to wait for your banner. It also
may be illegal, depending on where you live.

In other words, don't do it again.
