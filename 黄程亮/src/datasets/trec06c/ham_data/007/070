Hello Out there!

We are a group of computer science students here in Universidad Simon 
Bolivar (Caracas, Venezuela). We are currently teaching a robotics 
course as we took it last trimester. We are having trouble initializing 
the handyboards. The IC software doesn't seem to recognize them, and 
when it does it prompts some errors like 99, 101 etc. We are trying to 
get the Pcode downloaded but nothing seems to  work right.  I'm open to 
as many answers as you can send me. It's very important, because we have 
to keep the course advancing.

Thank to all of you.

Cesar Benitez.
Universidad Simon Bolivar
Caracas - Venezuela
