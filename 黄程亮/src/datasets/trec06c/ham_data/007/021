Hello,
I've bought a handy board, and try to build a card to enserve two motors.
On that card I have a IC chip (HP hctl 1100) that needs to be link to a 8 bits
Adress/data bus in both reading and writing modes. My problem is where to pick
such a bus on the board. So my two questions are:
- Is it possible to connect to D0..D7 bus (knowing I want to keep the screen 
   working as it's made for) to pick up informations without affecting the
screen
   functions? In that case do I need something as a latch to differentiate the
way 
   for the informations to go?
- Otherwise, how could I pick 8 I/O port on the board?

Please, help me: It makes me stay awaken all nights!!
Thanks in advance.
