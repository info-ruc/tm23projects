Greetings,

I just installed PGP for Linux 5.0, and am trying to integrate it with
Pine 3.96. I'm using the sending-filters config option to invoke pgp as
follows:

/usr/local/bin/pgps -fat		(this is like pgp -fast in 2.6.2)

pgp accepts the input from pine, asks me for the pass phrase, and reports

Success! Press return to continue

I press return, and Pine informs me:

> Problem filtering: Success <

and doesn't send the message.

What am I doing wrong? Please cc me as i'm not yet subbed to pine-info.

thanks,

brian
