Please read Appendix B of the 6.270 Robot Builders Guide.  This
explains how to interface latches with the Handy Board.

> Hello,
> I've bought a handy board, and try to build a card to enserve two motors.
> On that card I have a IC chip (HP hctl 1100) that needs to be link to a 8 bit
s
> Adress/data bus in both reading and writing modes. My problem is where to pic
k
> such a bus on the board. So my two questions are:
> - Is it possible to connect to D0..D7 bus (knowing I want to keep the screen 
>    working as it's made for) to pick up informations without affecting the
> screen
>    functions? In that case do I need something as a latch to differentiate th
e
> way 
>    for the informations to go?
> - Otherwise, how could I pick 8 I/O port on the board?
> 
> Please, help me: It makes me stay awaken all nights!!
> Thanks in advance.
