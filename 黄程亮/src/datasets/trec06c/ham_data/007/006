Did you read the help pine gives you? Hit "?" in the saving screen

Sure. It's all described very well in the documentation that's available
for pine, and it's sometimes system-specific (i.e. I don't know if you're
allowed to mount a floppy if you're on a u*ix system).

Stop shouting, start reading. Go to the pine website and grab a copy of
the documentation. It's worth reading, anyway.
