The current version of Telix for DOS is 3.51.

You are attempting this while in the pine composer? There is nothing to
configure on the pine end. It can't even be blocked in the system
configuration. As far as pine can tell, it is equivalent to accepting input
from your keyboard via your terminal emulation. It works on my system.

It is possible that you corrupted Telix. Try to install the current version.

What terminal emulation did you choose? Use vt102, and make sure your TERM is
set correctly in your shell.

Surely, you know that your connection rate has nothing whatsoever to do with
pine. I cannot help you on this mailing list.

What the hell are Cursor keys? If your terminal emulation were set correctly,
you could use the Arrow keys, or at your option, the Function keys in lieu of
Control key combinations for many tasks. pine can bind the Delete key itself,
and you could bind Home or End yourself within the Telix program.
