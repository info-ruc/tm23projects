Ummm... I beg to differ. If everything's working ok here again, this line
would do, too:
	rc.config:FROM_HEADER="franck.pc.uni-koeln.de"
I mean, if you can recompile, you're the admin, anyway, right? I have the
strong suspicion that Mike is trying to set up a stand-alone system. This is
the easiest solution.

Cheers,
