hmm. I think you're right..I mean about lynx not reading from standard
input. it would (more or less) explain what happens on this machine when I
try to pipe it. (nothing explains what happens on the last machine, except
perhaps the fact that it was held together by duct tape, bailing wire and
velcro)

Time to fire up vi and write a script.

-force_html looks useful too. I don't know why I havne't seen it before.
