I don't agree.  Here's why

a.  That standard format looks too codey.  I don't like codey looking
stuff.

b.  It's confusing looking.

c.  More chance that a long URL will not fit on a line.  You're just
making a longer line.  Too many characters.  And also, whoever's e-mail
progy may wrap lines.  How's ya supposed to follow it if it takes TWO
lines?!

d.  Would you expect everyday people to just type in all that, whenever
they mention a URL? I expect not.

Mike, leave it like you have it.

Tech. problems don't belong here.  But if you ask non-tech problems,
you'll find you don't belong here either.  :-)

Yeah.  So don't worry about sig.'s until people make universal EASY
methods to write them, and context sensitive inclusion.    

BTW, I don't like Sig.'s, take away Kbytes of message space.

2nd BTW, didn't someone just post here saying her e-mail program shut
down, now inoperative, based on file space overflow?  

If anyone likes Sig.'s, why not write my postmaster from the hostname, or
her postmaster.  And ask them to increase the general quota.

Ok---- here's my Sig.
