Financing   Aspen Ranch
From:	    Bobbi42@AOL.com

  To whom it mat concern;

       We are the Grandparents and guardians of 16 yr. old Jeffrey Dyer . He
has lived  with us for almost two years. They have been very difficult ones.
We have  decided that our public school system does not have the ability to
help our grandson mature into a espected, mature gentleman. I have since
transferred him to Aspen Achievement Academy which is located in Loa, Utah.
This  wilderness treatment program is committed to guide students and their
families toward internalizing principals and developing skillswhich facilitate
positive personal growth. This treatment program lasts for about 50 days.
After he completes that course on February 18th,he will move on to  Aspen
Ranch. These facilities are recognized and licensed by the Utah State Board of
Education, to operate as a special alternative school designed to effectively
reach students at risk. I am hopeful that they will reach Jeff. He is a third
year Freshmen and has failed this semester, due to absenteeism. If we do not
reach him soon, he will become another one of those drop-outs. Jeff needs to
be reeducated. The therapists think that they have a chance to accomplish
this, because he is responding to them. 
    We are close to retirement age and do not have the funds available to
sponsor him through the completion of these programs.We do not receive any
help from his parents, although  we are expecting about 390.00 a month from
his father, which is long over due child support. I do not have my hopes up
very high because he has contributed an embarrassing small amount of funds so
far. If he does, it will renew my faith in man kind, but it will not be nearly
be enough. His mom does not work,
because she has two little babies to care for. So that leaves the remaining
financial deficit to us. We can come up with  about 700.00 a month, but we are
still short about 2850.00 a month. Times that by  9 or 12 months, Wow! That is
expensive. 
      Jeff has experienced Rejection all of his life. His parents were
teenagers when he was born, and they never married. His father was very
abusive to both he and his mother. His Mom married  when he was 11 years old.
Three years after this blissful occasion, Jeff became very unhappy and out of
control. His behavior at school was outrageous. He became more and more
involved  with the police. He ran away, was extremely aggressive toward his
mother, began hitting  and attacking her with ugly intimating  vulgarity. He
was also aggressive toward his Step Father. I was not there to witness any of
this, but the out come was final.He was completely fed -up, and proceeded to
kick Jeff out of His house. This is when We took him in. We too had our
problems. By this time he thought he was a polished manipulator. He did not
respect us or our  rules. He stole a great deal of money from his
grandfather’s business, and from our vacation fund, he took my car for a joy
ride, with out my
permission or a license, he used abusive language on me in hopes of getting
his way. Between  his truancy and his horrible conduct, I realized that I
could not help him. The only recourse I had left was to get him some kind of a
treatment program. So on  December 30th, of last year, he left for Aspen.
Achievement Academy. We have exhausted all of our resources, including the
money I set aside  to pay our   property taxes, to place him there. Jeff is
very much worth the sacrifice that we are making. He needs to continue his
treatment, which means he will move on to Aspen Ranch. This step will further
educate him scholastically and emotionally. There just is not enough of our
money available to help him. 
Can you help us by sponsoring him? It would be a wonderful answer to a prayer
that is very deeply felt.
      Thank you for you time and God Bless:
