Hi there,

Would these chips be suitable for interfacing a mouse to
the Handyboard? My robot incorporates a mouse as a
castor wheel and I want to use its shaft encoders as
position/velocity sensors (relative) for the robot, but
I don't know where to look for details on how the
signals are generated and transmitted for a mouse. Do
you have any suggestions?

Marie
