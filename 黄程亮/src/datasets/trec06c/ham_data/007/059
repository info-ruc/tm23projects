So tell me please, I'm curious....What have *you* contributed to the list
lately?
What knowledge have *you* passed on to newcomers?
What contributions have you made to anyone's understanding of the email
program known as Pine?
Or is your coontribution confined to commenting acerbically on the responses
of those who *do* contribute, *do* flame when needed, and *do* add to the
otherwise bland nature of a technically oriented mailing list
You entitle yourself "Speaking Freely" as well you might. Think for a moment
about yur reaction to others who IN FACT speak.....Freely.
I'll treat your comments more seriously when you render some assistance, as
oposed to sitting in the gallery booing the players on the stage.
If in doubt, read the above once again, and keep doing so until you
understand that unless you are contributing or learning, you have NO place
here!
-Colin
