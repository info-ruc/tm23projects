Dear Everett, Marty,

Thank you very much for your quick response. We regret to inform you,
though, that we do not acutally sell "Purpose 98" as a plugin for MS
Exchange or Outlook. However, we highly recommend using Microsoft's powerful
ascii-editor "edlin" in its stead. This might possibly solve your problems
with non-RFC-compliant email messages.

The MS hotline, which is only $3 /min will certainly help you out with all
the necessary information.

If you should have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact
us again.

Yours truly,

Robin S. Socha M.A.
CEO German Web Force
