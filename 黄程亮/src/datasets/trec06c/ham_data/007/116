And everything in life has to be totally and completely constructive.
Don't laugh.  Don't eat food that has taste.  Think only constructive
thoughts.  No education should be in any way pleasant or entertaining.
Yeah, right.

Some of us appreciate Robin's wit.  If you don't, procmail him.  If you
don't see his attempts to help people in straight forward ways as well as
entertaining ways, then don't read his email.
