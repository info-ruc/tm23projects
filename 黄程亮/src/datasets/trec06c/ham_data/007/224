Interesting, but you haven't followed your own standard before.  You
have given URLs, not in the above form.

Second, a message body does not go by any "standard"!  People type in it.
Actual human beings.  You can type any word you want.  It will be included
in the message body.  (You can type German here too, as evidently you
have.  Even though this is an English speaking group.)

Standard, and who uses it?  I think you prefer argumentation anyway.
Robin prefers disagreeing to agreeing.  :-)

So you think it's a nice standard to have when 2% of Internet users may
use it?

Don't need to know HTML for an e-mail program.  HTML is not considered
acceptable in e-mail and on usenet.  HTML here is not *standard* usage.
Nope.  

HTML is for the Web.

Hello?  Hello??  Robin, you are contradicting yourself.

Amazing how you can contradict yourself in such a short time.  

You are most clearly quoted above.

Whatever "miles" you may be referring to, no one would be able to follow
the thread if everything was cropped.

My my what?  What does Gnus have to do with PINE discussion forum?  What
does your hd have to do with PINE?

My my, did she say she was using Gnus??

Or... Were you planning to send her the installation files for it, and
give her in-depth e-mail help on installing it?

Please talk some French or Latin instead.

Thank you for your cooperation.
