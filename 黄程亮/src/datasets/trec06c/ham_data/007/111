You don't think Robin has a minor dislike for Microsux Winblows products,
do you?  Did Bill Gates beat you as a child, Robin? Or do you just prefer 
real operating systems (Oh wait.. I forgot Win95 isn't an OS, but a GUI
for an OS.. oh wait, that was the original Winblows, I guess Win95 is
actually an OS, with a TUI (Textual User Interface, IE "MSDosPrompt" ;)
for those people who actually care what the computer is doing.. I'm so
confused..) :P~

Pat (I do Windows cuz it's 'hip'.. and all my toys are in Win95 format.)
