hello all,
I have only started building the Handy Board and have run into some
problems at the very start when i first conected the part built board. I
have build it as far as the power supply, stop switch and 68hc11 installed,
memory and 
lcd. When I try to send pcode_hb.s19 it sometimes stops half way through
and says
"error loading byte #0x98" and sometimes #0x99, #0x9a. And when it does
load it all it comes up with "invalid CONFIG Register (0x0d) try again"
although it is set to 0x0c in the box in HBDL . I have downloaded the pcode
file again from the handy board site to see if it was the file but when I
downloaded it to the board I still had no luck.

Thanks,
Gysmo@es.co.nz
