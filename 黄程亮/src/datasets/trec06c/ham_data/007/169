No, Colin, it isn't. I'm too tired to check the son-of-rfc-1632 or
something, stuff like urls goes in the header.

pookie.guts.com? Cute. But why on earth would you touch a sigfile and...

make it executable??? and then

use this abomination called pico to edit that file, instead of simply using
the sigfile option available on the M(ain) screen?

> ---------------------------------------------------<separator line

Colin? Back in the days when XEmacs roamed my harddrive, I had this:

;;* This one takes care of fucked-up signatures
(setq gnus-signature-separator
      '("-- *$"		; The standard
	"^-- *$"        ; A common mangling
        "^-------*$"    ; Many people just use a looong
                        ; line of dashes.  Shame!
        "^ *--------*$" ; Double-shame!
        "^________*$"   ; Underscores are also popular
        "^========*$")) ; Pervert!

That's "-- " and nothing else? dash dash blank. Some programs use this
separator to do fancy stuff with signatures. Pine doesn't, btw. Some
programs put sigdashes in automagically. Pine doesn't. Why me? Why my
XEmacs? Why not pine? I want my Gnus back... *sniff*

Unless your hdd is broken, you don't need the email in there - it's in your
from: line. The URL could use standard format, too: <URL:http://foo.bar.com>
to make it clickable. Pine doesn't do that, btw. *sigh*

Colin? You have just taught the young man how to do about everything
feasible wrong. But that's ok, because this is not gnu.emacs.gnus, but the
pine discussion forum, and the only reason we're here is because we are nice
chaps that enjoy a good laugh once in a while. Technical problems do not
really belong here...

Yeah... Some people have really cool stuff to change their signatures:

;;* Use random signatures in message-mode
;;  written by Matt Simmons <simmonmt@cs.purdue.edu>
(require 'random-sig)
(setq random-signature-head (expand-file-name "~/.sigfiles/HEAD"))
(setq random-signature-dir  (expand-file-name "~/.sigfiles"))
(setq message-signature 'random-signature-fun)

I wish things were as easy as that with pine.
