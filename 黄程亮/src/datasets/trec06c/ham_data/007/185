Usually.  I've seen one lately that didn't.  Since I hadn't gotten
this set up till now, thanks to you folks, I'd just skip it.

This is what got it working.  I tried the script below; it would
display the message which was unreadable otherwise (unless I saved and
viewed the file), but it still contained all the HTML tags.  The one
above works; the one below didn't quite cut it:

text/html;lynx -force_html %s;test=test -n "$LYNX_VERSION"
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-1 %s; copiousoutput
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-8 %s; copiousoutput
text/html; shownonascii iso-8859-7 %s; copiousoutput

I tried piping it through Lynx which was suggested earlier.  I was
using the four-line script above (haven't tried it with the new
one-liner, but it's more work to do that anyway), and it just locked
up.  Couldn't suspend the job; could only cut the connection and
re-logon, so I think I'll stick with the one-liner.  That fixed the
problem.
