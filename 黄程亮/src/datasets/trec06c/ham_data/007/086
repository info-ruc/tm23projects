Subject: Hooking up PA7

I downloaded the 9600 baud serial driver that uses Digital input #9 or
PA7 (I think).

It is really unclear to me which connector I should plug into. In
between the IR I/O section and the BATTPWR LED's there are a bunch of
connectors. The manual seems to say that J2 is what I need and also
talks about a connector labeled (right to left) 7-15.

I don't have any way of testing this and I was wondering if anyone knew
which connector to use.
