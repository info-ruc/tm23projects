Andrew, it's standard. I don't care what you think looks codey or not, if
you don't stick to standards, you're in great danger.

Guess you're easily confused.

No, Andrew, I'm using the accepted standard for a URL. Nothing more, nothing
less.

Yes, Andrew. Certainly.

Andrew, do you know HTML? If not, learn it.

Andrew, I think you don't understand. But that's ok. We've decided to be
nice and gentle.

No, Andrew.

Tech problems do belong here. One of those problems was my broken hdd.
BUT... Linux is not Windos, so I had a new running system with 60 minutes.
This rocks.

Andrew, it cannot get much easier than with pine, although (HELLO!!!) the
sigdashes should be standard when editing the sigfile.

Andrew, the miles of stuff you didn't crop in your reply took a lot more.

Oh dear... Mymy... Well, I certainly could tell Gnus not to save signatures
that are PROPERLY (you got me, Andrew?) separated.

Excellent. Andrew, you are totally meschugge.

It sucks. Plain and simple. Thanks for your valuable input, Andrew. Next
one, please.
