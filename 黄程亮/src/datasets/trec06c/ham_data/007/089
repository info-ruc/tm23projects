>Where is the command in Pine to save a attachment in html format?

There is no such command, nor should there ever be one. You'll have to use a
Web page editor. If, perchance, you were sent an attachment already in html
format, use the v command, and save the appropriate attachment to a file in
your home directory and naming it with an extension of .html. Then, read it
with your browser.
