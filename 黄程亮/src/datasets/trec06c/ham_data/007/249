Try:

"|/home/sapan/a.out"

as the position of the " marks can be significant.

If that fails, then try something like:

"|exec /home/sapan/a.out"

However, be advised that sometimes systems are configured to not allow 
delivery to "|".  You should also worry about possible abuse.

If what you want to develop a mail delivery program....then take Robin's
suggestion and get procmail.  They have already done the job and taken
into account most of the worries.

Ed
