3b.	Edit your .pinerc file

	Search for pattern "mailcap" and modify the following line to
	reflect the new change:

# Sets the search path for the mailcap cofiguration file.
# NOTE: colon delimited under UNIX, semi-colon delimited under DOS/Windows/OS2.
mailcap-search-path=/usr/home/highway/.mailcap:/etc/mailcap
