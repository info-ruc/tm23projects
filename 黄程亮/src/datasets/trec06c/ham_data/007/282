OK, time to weigh in on this, I'm out of cigarettes and this is
intolerable.
Bobbi, some points for you to bear in mind (not in order of priority)
	1. Soliciting charitable donations via mailing lists is considered
fraudulent.
	2. AOL's TOS (you know what those are, don't you) expressly
prohibits what you are presently doing.
	3. This is a mailing list devoted exclusively to the use of an
email program known as PINE, nothing else...period.
So, here's what I am (personally, not purported to be on behalf of this
mailing list, University of Washington, or any other member) going to
suggest to you in the strongest possible terms. You should pay attention
to this, treat it seriously, and act upon it immediately:
	a) Cease and desist from sending solicitation mail to
pine-info@u.washington.edu.
	b) Upon receipt of this e-mail, reply to all recipients, stating
that you have read and understood, and accept the contents, and that you
agree not to send further mail to the list.
Failure to do both of the above will result in me contacting the TOS at
AOL, and having your AOL account suspended. 
You may care to note that AOL is increasingly concerned about the actions
of their membership, and will take action swiftly to prevent you from
sending any further solicitation email.
I encourage you to do this, because if I personally see another
solicitation from you to this list, I will immediately take the action set
forth above.
Your reply, stating your agreement to the terms is awaited.
Regards,
Colin.
