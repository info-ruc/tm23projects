Dear Fellow List Members,
I am pleased and delighted to welcome Don back...if I recall correctly, (I
may be wrong here) but I believe he's a prolific and knowledgeable
contributor to the Redhat list.
This gentleman has class and courage to post an apology to a worldwide list,
and I encourage everyone to pause and give this action he took some careful
and (sober) thought.
As he stated, he has indeed sent me a personal email, and I am publicly
stating that I received it in good faith, and responded in an honorable
fashion by way of acceptance.
I personally hope that if I ever do someone a real (or perceived) injustice,
I will have the humility and courage to take an honorable course of action
such as this, especially in light of the fact that he could have appeared on
the list under his own personna and no one would ever have known he was the
one who took a couple of us to task.
Now perhaps <grin> we can get back to Pine, and toasting the occasional
individual who darkens our doorway with Microsoft or Armadillo pest control
requests???
Hey Don.....welcome!
-Colin
