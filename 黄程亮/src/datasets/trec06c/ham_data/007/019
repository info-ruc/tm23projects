thank you for your reply, norbert. this was bout the only thing that i
could come up with, though i must add i hadnt had an idea where to
start/what to edit. my proficiency is not as great as i would like it to
be, though creating a patch that would make this value user-definable
(preferrably somewhere in the main menu) would be a GREAT idea. im not
very versed in diff files or such either, nor have i the technical
expertise to do anything of the likes. perhaps there are any takers????
thanks again,
Oleg
