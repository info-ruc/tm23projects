Hi, 
	We are trying to use PINE 3.96 on a box Running AIX 4.2.1.  The
executable we have was precompiled for AIX at UCLA.
  
PROBLEM:  when sending a new message the following message appears:

   "[Sending mail |     0%   |]"

and Pine just sites there with the percentage never changing from zero.
We end up having to kill the Pine session.

NOTE:  We are able to send messages with the "mail" and "mailx" commands.
