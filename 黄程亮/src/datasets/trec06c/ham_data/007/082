This a problem that I have ask about before. When I get mails from user
of MS Exchange or outlook and they have the edit setup to be ms word
then I can get the email and read it but it has trash at the end. I have
call exchange support and I was told that this was fixed in pine 4.0
here is the test of message the I got from exchange support. It seems
that the people at Exchange support are wrong and I need to call and
tell that.

thanks Marty

Hello,
	I am a support engineer for Microsoft that has a customer that
is
experiencing problems with the Pine 3.96 client running on a R6000
terminal.
The problem exists using RTF format of Exchange messages to the Pine
email
system. The customer is interested in trying the Pine 4.0 email client
to
see if the problem still exists. There was a link on the page below,
that
says you can get it here, but the URL is no longer active. Do you know
where
I may find it now? Any help would be deeply appreciated.

for anyone who liked the features of Pine 1.0 (Linux97 
or Slackware98)you can download Pine 4.0 preview 
release 2 which has most of the new features. I already have it 
and I've had no problems. 
*	Get it here...
