Greetings,

Thank you for your previous suggestions. However, I am attempting to use
PGP 5.0 with Pine, not 2.6.2. 5.0 has different calling semantics, and I
am having quite a bit of difficulty porting any of the suggested solutions
to PGP 5.0 due to these semantic differences.

I would like to instead address why pine returns >Problem filtering:
Success<...

"Success" is not generated by pgps, pgpe, or pgpv (the pgp executables for
pgp 5.0) so it looks like it's added by Pine's filter layer. But if Pine
is returning success, why does it die with "Problem filtering"...I'm
afraid I don't understand.

tia, and please cc me.

-brian
