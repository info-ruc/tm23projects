Robin:

I don't know you, and I have enjoyed your humor on the list for the past 4
months or so.  I had no bad intentions toward yourself or colin when I
placed the posts to the pine-info group.  After doing so, and driving home
the long drive that I do, I started rethinking my actions, and realized that
I was completely wrong in my postings.

I would like you to know that I actually appreciate people like yourself who
try to prevent ego maniacs like bill gateus of Borg from trying to take over
the computing planet.  I work at a larger US Corporation, and I have steered
them away from NT for their Internet functions, and use FreeBSD exclusively
in that area.

I actually am well versed in Netiquette, as I owned an ISP with 3000+
members,
and we had to give them talks about this frequently.  I never intended to
even respond to you, until I read the last line of your post back to me when
I responded about Colin flaming Jennifer, the part about PC is dead and
buried.  When you read something, and you write something back in the heat
of the moment, especially over email, it is easier to be a complete butt
head
than when speaking to a person directly.  I lost my composure and I
apologize for doing so in a public forum.  My comments were far from
accurate toward you.  It just seemed that lately, the list has had more and
more unfriendly responses.  As you noted, this is directly correlated to the
increase of rude and inappropriate messages to the group.

I am far from a saint, and I again apologize for acting like I was.

I do hope that you find it within yourself to understand and forgive my
harsh words.

Sincerely,

Don Allaire....no longer Speaking Freely.
