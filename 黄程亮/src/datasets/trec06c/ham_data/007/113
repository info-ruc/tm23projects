Dear Sir,
Two days ago, I received an email from
pine-robot@docserver.cac.washington.edu which asked me if I like to use
the new version of pine. It said there is only a little change so I said
"yes". But then I found that the new version could not fit my email system
or the maching. It destroyed many fuctions and documents. If possible,
please help me cancel the new version and let me still use the old
version. Or, you can tell me how to do it by myself. Your help will be
greatly appreciated!
Sincerely yours,
Jian Teng
