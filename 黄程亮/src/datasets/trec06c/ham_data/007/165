It's seemed to me that one could pipe it through lynx (that only works for
un*x systems, though). But my computer has been loathe to do that. 

However, that was my old one, my new one seems to handle viewers and such
much better. Maybe I should try it again. (better hardware, more current
version of linux and pine, etc)

anyway, said commands would be V(iew)(highlight the appropriate
attatchment) | lynx

oh, and you have to set that in the configuration.

I don't know if this will work, though. it just should theoretically
