I have recieved a few requests for the filter, but noone has given me any
feedback yet as to whether they like it or not.. go fig...
Anyway, now is as good a time as any to resend the info, so here goes:

Pat

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of you are familiar with pgppine and papp.

A friend of mine and I have taken a copy of papp and performed practically
a total rewrite on it.  The program has many of the old features, like
saving your password encrypted in a session key, but also has some handy
new features, and MUCH more readable output.  If you would like to help us
test it (We haven't found any bugs in it with pine v3.96 and pgp v2.6.2),
just drop me a line.  NOTE: this program is available by request only
until beta testing is completed, then we will post the perl
script wherever.

NOTE: be sure to include something in the Subject of your message
pertaining to beta testing, as my mailbox gets flooded from time to time.

Also, any suggestions as to other places to go for beta testers
would be appreciated.

Thank You,
Patrick Farabee
