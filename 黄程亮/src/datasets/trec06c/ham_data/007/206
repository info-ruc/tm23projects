My University of MD. email account is having problems. I have too many
messages, but I'm trying to delete them and it doesn't work. The message
says that there is a system's error and I need to press s for Shell to
clean it up but it will not delete my messages. Could you please advise me
and explain what I'm doing wrong. I'm not sure I will get your message. I
have an account with Baltimore County Puclic Library in Maryland.
