I use TELIX v3.22 to communicate with the Pine System at the Kitsap
Regional Library and a I have a serious problem.

Apparently, the Pine system, when in the mode to accept hand typed
messages, will not accept ASCII transfers. This makes it very difficult to
send pre-made messages.

Also, from time to time what I am typing gets bounced around to different
places on the screen and sometimes overtypes what is already there,
including the header, not to mention the characters that occure that I
dont type (resembling control codes and the like).

Just for the record, this connect has been doing the above mentioned
things and my connection rate is at 1200, in spite of trying to connect at
33.6k. When the connection was made, it first showed a rate of 26.4k.
Something is wrong and/or confusing.

BTW, ASCII Transfers are really very important to me. I am also not very
please with the commands that require Control-this and Control-that. I run
a BBS on a Commodore and even that computer accepts Cursor keys along with
the standard . (dot) or / (slash) codes used in BBSes and wordprocessors.
