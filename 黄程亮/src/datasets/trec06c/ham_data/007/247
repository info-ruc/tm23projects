I've seen this at times...forgot the exact conditions.  The problem had to
do with which options pine was using when it called sendmail.

To "workaround" the problem rather than change the options and recompile
I simply set:

smtp-server =

to the fully qualified name of the local host.

in my .pinerc file.  In the case where you are servicing a large community 
it would be advisable to put that information in the system wide pinerc
file.

Ed
