Yup, there's a really easy solution readily available to you called a
signature file (otherwise known as a dotsig or .signature) and it's a bit
more elegant than twenty header lines.
Two methods of accomplishing what (I think) you are looking for:
1. quit pine, and at the command prompt do a:
pookie.guts.com$touch .signature
pookie.guts.com$chmod 755 .signature
pookie.guts.com$pico .signature
(this brings up the default text editor and your screen will be blank,
because it's a new and empty file you've brought up)
at the top, type something like the following:
------------------------------------------------------------<separator line
don't type this in, just a version of what's below it>

------------------------------------------------------------<separator line>
Try (please) to limit your dotisg to maybe five lines max if it's feasible
(it is in your case) and follow the format shown above.
OK, next do a ^O (Ctrl O) and you'll see a "File Name to Write .signature?"
hit enter and there will be a couple of brief messages that flash by. Then
hit ^X (Ctrl X) which bales you out of pico.
OK, now you have a dotsig, now how do you incorporate it into each email you
send? simple. Get back into Pine and on the main menu screen hit "S" (Setup)
"C" (Configure" and tab down the selections to signature-file. If it reads
<No Value Set: using .signature> then leave it alone, if it reads
differently, hit "C" (Change value) and type in .signature) then tab down
almost to the end of the first section of configurable variables until you
see signature-at-bottom and check that by hitting enter or hit the "x" key.
Now hit "E" (Exit Configuration) you'll see the message "Commit Changes
("Yes" replaces settings, "No" abandons changes)? and hit enter or "y" for
yes to commit the changes you have made. Now hit "C" for compose, and voila,
there will be a .dotsig which will remain at the bottom of each email you
send until you decide to ever change it or delete it.
I gave you the "real" way to create a dotsig, although Pine will do it for
you if you go to setup/configuration/signature which is a bad way of
learning anything about Unix. Follow this method, and you've learned several
things....how to create a file from scratch, change it's permissions (never
mind too much about that for now but it's there anyway) and open it, edit
it, save the changes, and make it work within your email environment.
Hope this answers your question, and if so, we expect you to post to the
list using your new dotisg!!!!! Don't worry if it's goofy to begin with,
just about everyone has a goofy dotsig in the beginning. You'll change it as
time goes by, everyone does.
Good Luck!
