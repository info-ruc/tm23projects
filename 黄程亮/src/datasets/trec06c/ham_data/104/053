U.S. SENATE STRONGLY SUPPORTS NIH PUBLIC ACCESS POLICY
Panel Requires NIH to Record and Post Statistics to Judge Effectiveness

WASHINGTON, D.C. =96 One month after the U.S. House of Representatives=20=

endorsed the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Public Access policy=20
and called for measures to judge its effectiveness, the U.S. Senate=20
Appropriations Committee followed suit yesterday with language=20
requesting a prompt and thorough report evaluating the success of the=20
policy.

"Alliance for Taxpayer Access members are committed to ensuring the=20
implementation of a meaningful public access policy at NIH, and we are=20=

encouraged by this strong signal of support from  Congress," said=20
Heather Joseph, Executive Director of SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing=20
and Academic Resources Coalition), the founding alliance member.  "We=20
are gratified that Members of the Senate Appropriations Committee=20
recognize the important purpose of the NIH public access policy: to=20
speed scientific progress and serve the public.  ATA will continue=20
working with the Congressional leadership to ensure the policy's=20
success.=94

The Senate report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2006 Labor, Health and=20
Human Services, and Education Appropriations bill requests a report=20
from NIH, to be submitted by February 2006, that will include the total=20=

number of applicable works submitted since the May 2 implementation=20
date, as well as the embargo period selected by each submitting author.

"ATA believes that the NIH policy's success will be measured by the=20
number of articles deposited in PubMed Central and made accessible to=20
the public soon after publication,=94 said Joseph. =93ATA has =
consistently=20
asked that the NIH provide statistics on the number of papers that are=20=

posted on NIH=92s PubMed Central repository to help gauge the policy=92s=20=

effectiveness.  We are very pleased that both the Senate and House have=20=

requested this critical data from NIH. Moreover, we commend NIH=20
Director Elias Zerhouni for his positive response to ATA=92s request to=20=

post these critical submission data on the NIH public access website." =20=

(To view this document, go to=20
www.taxpayeraccess.com/docs/NIH_Postings_Response.pdf)

Data recently released by NIH indicate that the number of submissions=20
since the policy's implementation in early May is very low.   Based on=20=

annual data, NIH funding is responsible for about 65,000 scholarly=20
articles a year.  Therefore, NIH grantees could have chosen to place=20
approximately 11,000 articles on PubMed Central=97=97making this=20
taxpayer-funded research available free to the public.  However,=20
statistics provided by NIH this week show that only three percent of=20
this number, or 340 articles accepted for publication, have been=20
submitted by NIH grantees.

Sharon F. Terry, President of the Genetic Alliance and a member of the=20=

Public Access Working Group, commented that "If we were a venture=20
capital company investing in a new business, and we saw early=20
performance returns at the rate of three percent, we would not wait to=20=

re-examine our strategy."

The ATA remains a strong advocate for immediate open access to research=20=

funded by the NIH.  Further information on this issue is available at=20
www.taxpayeraccess.org.
###

The Alliance for Taxpayer Access is an informal coalition of=20
stakeholders who support reforms that will make publicly funded=20
biomedical research accessible to the public. The Alliance was formed=20
in 2004 specifically to urge that peer-reviewed articles on=20
taxpayer-funded research at NIH become fully accessible and available=20
online and at no extra cost to the American public. Details on the=20
alliance may be found at www.taxpayeraccess.org.
