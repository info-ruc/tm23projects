Technical track on: Reliable Computations and their Applications
(RCA'06)
=20
RCA'06 is the second edition of this technical track, on Reliable
Computations and their Applications, with a particular emphasis on
combining interval and constraint satisfaction techniques. It will
be held at SAC'06 between April 23 and 27, in Dijon (France).

SAC'2006
=20
For the past twenty years, the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing
(SAC) has been a primary gathering forum for applied computer
scientists, computer engineers, software engineers, and
application developers from around the world. SAC 2006 is
sponsored by the ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing,
hosted by the University of Bourgogne, and held in Dijon, France.
=20
Overview of RCA'06:
=20
Many numerical computations, be they solutions to systems of
differential equations or optimization problems coming from
applied areas like protein folding, do not provide us with
guaranteed computation results. In many situations, we have
numerical solutions, we may even have a theorem guaranteeing that,
eventually, this numerical solution tends to the actual precise
one, but the algorithm itself does not provide us with guaranteed
bounds on the difference between the numerical approximate
solution and the desired actual one.
=20
Therefore, in some practical situations, numerical solutions are
much farther from the actual (unknown) precise solutions than the
users assume. As a result, we often end up with inefficient local
maxima for practical optimization problems like chemical
engineering - or even with a mission failure if we are planning,
e.g., a spaceship trajectory. For some such algorithms,
researchers have found such guaranteed bounds, but producing such
a bound for each algorithm requires a lot of work.
=20
It is therefore desirable to develop a methodology that would
provide algorithms with automatic result verification, i.e., with
automatically generated upper bound on the difference between the
actual and the numerical solution. In other words, we need
computation techniques that produce reliable (guaranteed) results.
=20
This problem was recognized already in the 1950s. The corresponding
techniques, largely developed by Ramon E. Moore, were later applied
in guaranteeing trajectories of spaceflights and in other practical
problems where deviations from the target are of critical importance.

The main idea behind these techniques is that at any intermediate
step of the computations, instead of the exact number, we keep an
interval of possible values. For inputs (that usually come from
measurements), we have an interval because measurements are never
100% accurate; if the manufacturer of the measuring instrument
guarantees that the measurement error is D or smaller, then the
measuring result X means that the actual value is in the interval
[X-D,X+D]. At each elementary computational step, we apply interval
arithmetic to the corresponding intervals and produce the interval
for the result; e.g., [a,b]+[c,d] leads to [a+c,b+d]. Of course,
this "straightforward interval computation", that does not take
dependence between intermediate results into consideration, does
not always lead to efficient estimates. However, in the last 40+
years, efficient interval computations methods have been developed
based on this original idea. There are a lot of interesting
applications of interval computations, there is a lot of potential,
but there are still a lot of open problems, situations where new
techniques are needed.

a lot of interesting applications of interval computations, there
is a lot of potential, but there are still a lot of open problems,
situations where new techniques are needed.
=20
Let us emphasize that, besides handling the uncertainty due to
measurements, intervals also prove to be very convenient and
useful when it comes to performing computations with inherent
uncertainty. This is the case for instance when a quantity is not
known precisely (e.g., the length of a mechanic component only
known to lie between 12 and 13 cm). Intervals enable to take this
kind of incomplete knowledge into account, which other approaches
mainly fail to handle.
=20
One such technique that has also been used to provide guaranteed
bounds is the technique of constraint propagation. This technique
originated in logical AI problems, and it has been lately
successfully applied to numerical problems, often in conjunction
with interval methods. For example, one of the latest textbooks on
interval computations, by Jaulin et al., contains robot-related
practical examples of combining these two techniques. This
combination has started, it is the object of interest by many
researchers, it has already led to interesting and efficient
packages like Numerica, but there is still a lot of room for
potential improvement.
=20
Scope of RCA'06:
=20
We hope that our track, with an emphasis on such a combination,
will bring together not only algorithm developers but also
practitioners whose practical needs will help guide researchers in
the proper directions.

=20
The authors should send their papers electronically to Martine
Ceberio. Peer groups with expertise in the track focus area will
blindly review submissions to that track. Therefore the authors
should submit anonymous versions of their paper(s). Accepted
papers will be published in the annual conference proceedings.

Submission guidelines will be posted on SAC 2006 Website.
=20
Submission:
=20
The deadline for submission is September 1st, 2005. Prospective
authors should send their papers electronically to Martine
Ceberio, with "[RCA'06] Submission" as the subject of the e-mail.

In addition, the paper should be:
no more than 5 pages long; submitted in postscript or pdf format;
without the authors' names; formatted using the IEEE style (for
information, you can find here, the zip files of the instruction
to Authors of SAC'05; updated information will be posted here as
soon as available).
=20
IMPORTANT INFORMATION: Every author must ALSO register their
paper(s) and submit the abstract(s) before the abstract submission
deadline date (September 1, 2005). In order to register the paper,
the author must submit the electronic form, available at the webpage.
=20
Abstract Submission Guidelines: Authors must register their intent
to submit a paper by submitting an electronic abstract (in text
format) of a maximum length of 200 words by the due date prior to
the actual submission and obtain a paper identification number.

Prior to submitting the abstract, authors will be required to
register as users on the system. Once an author has submitted an
abstract, he/she will receive a confirmation email with
instructions on submitting the paper. The format of the submitted
paper must be PDF or Postscript.
=20
Let us also recall the prospective authors that the acceptance rate
at SAC is set to 33 to 36%. Therefore, we strongly encourage
authors not to hesitate to submit several articles.

Dijon, former capital of the Dukes of Burgundy, is a town steeped
in history, proud heir to a rich architectural legacy. Dijon is
one of the first sectors safeguarded in France; Dijon accounts for
97 ha of nationally classed monuments very well preserved. Lying
at the gates of the famous vineyards of the C=F4te de Nuits, Dijon
is also one of the glories of the French gastronomic tradition,
known throughout the world for its mustard, blackcurrant liqueur,
gingerbread, etc. It is also a university town, a business and
cultural centre boasting a wide and varied choice of hotels, an
auditorium and extensive reception facilities capable of hosting
all kinds of events.
