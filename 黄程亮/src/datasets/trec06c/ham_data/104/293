    Essentially identical.  Radically different is another retrace 
interval, 70 Hz, 85 Hz, that kind of thing.

   Yes.

   Not great but probably functioning.

   Those are all usable sorts of timing characteristics, nothing great but 
probably not causing your delay inconsistencies.

   Hmm, well it's a mystery to me.  I can see a similar effect here at home 
(a wretched machine for DMDX if ever there was one) but instead of 80 ticks 
I see things like 82 ticks (a much easier thing to explain that 80 ticks). 
I'm  thinking the code is busted but we have any number of people running 
fMRI stuff with <rcot> and if it wasn't working I'm sure I'd be hearing 
about it -- perhaps they're all using earlier versions that are still 
ok.  Gods, you can even see it in EZ mode where there is no raster 
synch.  Weird, my guess is something I stuck in to allow super fast 
branching has disturbed the Delay mechanism.  I'll be looking at it this 
week, rest assured.
