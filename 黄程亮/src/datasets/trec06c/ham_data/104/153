>This Program Announcement (PA) solicits health services research on the 
>prevention and treatment of drug and alcohol abuse. The goals of the 
>health services research programs at both the National Institute on Drug 
>Abuse (NIDA) and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism 
>(NIAAA) are to answer questions central to the delivery of prevention and 
>treatment services for all substances of abuse: What works? Under what 
>circumstances? For which conditions? and, At what cost? These questions 
>may be studied from multiple perspectives, including those of the 
>individual drug user or drinker; the individual's family, friends, and 
>employer; the treatment provider and the provider's organization; of other 
>organizations affected by problems of drug and alcohol abuse (e.g., 
>criminal justice, social service, public health); and of purchasers of 
>drug and alcohol abuse prevention and treatment services.
>
>Proposed research might emphasize any of the following subjects:
>
>(1) Factors that affect the delivery of drug and alcohol abuse 
>intervention and related services, such as social factors, personal 
>behaviors and attributes, financing, organization, management, and health 
>technologies;
>(2) Dimensions of drug and alcohol abuse intervention and related 
>services, such as accessibility, utilization, quality, effectiveness, and 
>costs;
>(3) Processes of (a) blending evidence-based drug and/or alcohol abuse 
>prevention and treatment practices into community-based care, and 
>conversely, (b) translating the questions of concern to practitioners into 
>rigorous research; and
>(4) Development or refinement of research tools­including study designs, 
>measurement instruments, and data analytic methods­to facilitate higher 
>quality health services research on drug and/or alcohol abuse.
