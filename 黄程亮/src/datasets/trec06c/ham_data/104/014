Guiseppe,

The midpoint of a matrix is that matrix whose (i,j)-th element is
the midpoint of the (i,j)-th element of the corresponding interval
matrix. 

Generally, even if the interval matrix is represented exactly in the
machine, the elements of the midpoint matrix are not exactly representable.
However, this usually does not cause a problem in the contexts where
the midpoint matrix is used.  For example, an approximate inverse of
the midpoint matrix is commonly used to precondition linear systems
of equations with interval coefficients that are relatively narrow.  
Rigor is not lost by using
an approximation, although, for rigor, interval arithmetic should be used in
applying the preconditioner (approximate or not).

Sincerely,

R. Baker Kearfott
